Arrested: Unemployed town councillor John Larsen's home in Denbigh has been searched by police investigating the series of explosions in North Wales, and has been charged today

A Liberal Democrat councillor arrested over a series of unexplained explosions he had blamed on 'Ali G-style yobs' has appeared in court.

Residents in the sleepy Welsh market town of Denbigh had been left terrified by a series of blasts which wrecked cars, broke windows and damaged homes.

Today North Wales Police confirmed that John Larsen, 46, was charged with causing an explosion likely to endanger life or damage property.

Larsen, who sits on Denbigh Town Council and represents the central ward, appeared at Prestatyn Magistratesâ€™ Court and was remanded in custody. He did not enter a plea.

James Neary, prosecuting at Prestatyn court, told District Judge Andrew Shaw during a five minute hearing it was 'an extremely serious and unusual charge'.

He applied for a remand in custody and said a major police investigation was 'in its infancy.'

Defence solicitor Dafydd Roberts said : 'He doesn't accept the allegations against him.'

There was no application for bail. Judge Shaw remanded Larsen in custody to appear at Mold crown court next Monday.

The district judge said : 'I can't deal with this charge in this court. It needs to be dealt with in the crown court.'

Last week officers arrested him and began searching the home he shares with 
his art assistant wife, Ffion, 40, and their ten-year-old daughter.

There have been 14 home-made devices exploded over the past eight weeks in Denbigh, and forced some residents to move away, while others put their homes up for sale.

One couple, John and Shirley Jones, had a lucky escape when ball bearings from a device planted beneath a 4x4 car smashed their window and became lodged in the headboard of their bed.

Mrs Jones said: 'It could have been fatal if we'd been in bed. It was horrendous, so frightening. We saw a flash and then heard a boom sound which shook the house.'

North Wales Police said the investigation related to 'a series of incidents whereby objects have been ignited'.

Councillor Colin Hughes, who represents the upper ward on the town council, said he was 'absolutely flabbergasted', adding: 'I am shocked. Myself and a number of my colleagues are really rocked to the foundations.'

Many assumed that the crude firework-type devices were the work of local yobs and police would soon catch those responsible.

Police called in specialist bomb disposal teams and evacuated residents after swooping on the councillor's terraced home.

Only last week Mr Larsen had spoken to his local newspaper to denounce the person responsible for the explosions, saying: 'Everyone is jittery, checking their cars. It's driving people round the bend.

'You just don't know when or where it's going to happen next and that's why people are so frightened.'

The councillor also spoke at a residents' meeting blaming 'Ali G-style yobs' for the bombs.

He later posted on his Facebook page: 'Again the yobs have let another one off last night in my back garden or yard. Ffion my wife is fed up to the back teeth with these yobs and is very worried about the house being damaged or set on fire. Someone stop these yobs before someone gets hurt.'

The explosions, which all occurred in the early hours, began in March and were focused around a triangle of waste ground near Mr Larsen's home in Denbigh, north Wales.

One neighhour, who didn't want to be named, said: 'My partner and I have evacuated our children, aged 20 months and two months, on two nights, taking them to a friend's house round the corner.

'When you have a bomb disposal unit outside your house it's hard not to be concerned.'

Fellow town councillor Geraint Lloyd-Williams added: 'Everyone has been really shocked that the police made this arrest.

'I'd be surprised if John was involved, he's not a well man, he walks with a stick after hurting his back a few years ago.'

Around 40 people living near Mr Larsen's home were moved to the town hall on Friday evening and on Saturday after the Army bomb squad was called in. Raymond Bartley, Mayor of Denbigh, said the explosions had been 'worrying' and 'extremely traumatic'.

Two other men, 23 and 22, have been released on bail.
