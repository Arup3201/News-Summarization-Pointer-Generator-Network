Carlos Velasco Carballo had a good game in difficult circumstances.

He is a strong referee who uses cards liberally in La Liga â€” but this is the World Cup. Referees have been told to be cautious with their cards and remember that a player misses a game for just two bookings.

Man in the middle: Spanish referee Carlos Velasco Carballo took charge of England against Uruguay

I am sure Velasco would have dismissed Diego Godin for his second yellow card in the first half but he held back and the Uruguayan captain was saved.

As an England fan I was screaming at the television when Uruguayan players made heavy tackles.

But there were plenty of dives by England players and Leighton Baines and Raheem Sterling were allowed to escape after strong challenges.

England can have no complaints about the referee who was fair and impartial.
