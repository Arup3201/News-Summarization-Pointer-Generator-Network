The father of America's 2,000th military fatality in Afghanistan has paid a moving tribute to his fallen son, telling how he had been 'proud to serve his country'.

Army Sergeant First Class Daniel Metcalfe, 29, from Liverpool, N.Y., himself a father-of-three, was killed in an attack on an Afghan army checkpoint in Wardak province on Saturday.

His father, Tom Metcalfe, said his son had been on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan, when he became the apparent latest victim in a spate of insider or 'green on blue' attacks.

Liverpool, N.Y., is the 2,000th US military fatality in Afghanistan

As he drove to Dover Air Force Base to meet his son’s remains, Mr Metcalfe told Rochetser's WHAM TV: 'He was proud to serve his country.

'I hated to lose him, knew that was always a possibility, but he was a good man.'

Sergeant Metcalfe served with the 2nd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team who are based in Vicenza, Italy. 

According to the casualty report, he died in Wardak province's Sayyid Abad district when his unit came under attack by small-arms fire.

A Nato statement read: 'The incident occurred while an ISAF unit was manning a temporary check point in an area near an Afghan National Army unit. 

'According to ISAF and ANA reporting, after a short conversation took place between ANA and ISAF personnel firing occurred which resulted in the fatal wounding of an ISAF soldier and the death of his civilian colleague. 

'In an ensuing exchange of fire three ANA personnel are reported to have died. '

According to Shahidullah Shahid, a provincial government spokesman, two Afghan soldiers were also killed in the attack.

Speaking immediately after the incident Mr Shahid said an Afghan soldier had turned his gun on the Americans and started shooting.

He said: 'Initial reports indicate that a misunderstanding happened between Afghan army soldiers and American soldiers.'

Afghan soldiers and policemen - or militants in their uniforms - have gunned down more than 50 foreign troops so far this year, eroding the trust between coalition forces and their Afghan partners.

An equal number of Afghan policemen and soldiers also died in these attacks, giving them reason as well to be suspicious of possible infiltrators within their ranks.

The attacks are taking a toll on the partnership between international and Afghan forces, prompting the US military to restrict operations with small-sized Afghan units earlier this month.

Costs: The program to train and equip 350,000 Afghan policemen and soldiers has cost the American taxpayer more than $22 billion in the past three years

The close contact - with coalition forces working side by side with Afghan troops as advisers, mentors and trainers - is a key part of the US strategy for putting the Afghans in the lead as the US and other nations prepare to pull out their last combat troops at the end of 2014, just 27 months away.

The first 33,000 U.S. troops withdrew by the end of September, leaving 68,000 still in Afghanistan. A decision on how many U.S. troops will remain next year will be taken after the American presidential elections.

Nato currently has 108,000 troops in Afghanistan — including U.S. forces — down from nearly 150,000 at its peak last year.

The program to train and equip 350,000 Afghan policemen and soldiers has cost the American taxpayer more than $22 billion in the past three years.

The number of American dead reflects a 
count by the Associated Press of those members of the armed services 
killed inside Afghanistan since the US-led invasion on October 7 2001.
