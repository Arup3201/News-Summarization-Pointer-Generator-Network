Louis van Gaal believes Radamel Falcao's Premier League career will take off after the Colombia star claimed his first goal for Manchester United to clinch victory over Everton.

Falcao, who could end up costing more than £50million if his loan move from Monaco becomes permanent, had failed to score in his first three games in England but pounced in the second half to give United a 2-1 win at Old Trafford.

The 28-year-old missed several earlier opportunities and Van Gaal revealed that he had spoken to Falcao about trying too hard.

Louis van Gaal said the expensive loan signing needed the goal after putting a lot of pressure on himself

'He needed that goal,' said the United boss. 'I have talked with him because I thought he was forcing himself too much to score a goal.

'He's a player who will normally score a goal every match and has had to wait so long. I can understand that but now he has scored it will be better after the international break.'

Victory lifted United into the top four but Van Gaal admitted his team are still not playing to full capacity after spending more than £150m in the summer.

'I have told my players that we are not playing good but we are already fourth,' added the Dutchman. 'What is coming when we are playing well?

'I was amazed because we played such a very good first half and this is the second game (in a row) when we are not good in the second half.'

United still needed a man-of-the-match performance from David de Gea to see the game out. The Spaniard became the first goalkeeper to save a Leighton Baines penalty in the Premier League after Luke Shaw fouled Tony Hibbert, and then made several outstanding stops late in the game.

'I'm devastated it was a penalty because I thought I touched the ball,' said Shaw. 'But all thanks to David De Gea. He was world-class and got us three points.'

Defeat left Everton one place above the relegation zone and there was more bad news for Roberto Martinez when defender John Stones was carried off with an ankle injury that is likely to rule him out of England's Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia.

The Everton boss was unhappy that the game was not stopped for another injury to Steven Pienaar in the build-up to Falcao's decisive goal.

'That action was a big mistake from the referee,' said Martinez. 'United attacked and the ball ends up in our net, and I don't think that is fair.'
