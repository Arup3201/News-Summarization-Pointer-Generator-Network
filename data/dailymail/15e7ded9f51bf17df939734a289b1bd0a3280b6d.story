Racemail's Captain Heath runs the rule over some horses that could shine in the coming weeks. 

UNSINKABLE (Trained by Ger Lyons)

Runners from Ireland don’t figure very often in this column but this one was such an easy winner when well backed on Saturday that he must be mentioned. Has done the rounds in Britain, most recently with Scottish trainer Ian Semple. His handicap mark has plummeted and even allowing for the hike his easy win will prompt, he will still probably be on a fair mark. He likes soft ground but you may have to wait for his next run – the 2015 Irish Lincoln Handicap has been mentioned as a target.

REGAL ENCORE (Trained by Anthony Honeyball)

Included on this list but with a large question mark after his fourth place to Shelford at Chepstow on Saturday. This gelding still has a long way to go to live up to his top-notch Bumper form and he pulled far too hard to have any hope of realistically seeing out his race. But on the positive side, AP McCoy was not hard on his mount and there remains a suspicion that a big handicap prize could ultimately come his way.

Question marks still hang over AP McCoy mount Regal Encore (right) but a major handicap prize in on the cards

PICK YOUR CHOICE (Trained by William Haggas)

There was a positive word for this son of Elusive Quality, which carries the colours of the Queen, ahead of his debut at Newmarket. He travelled well before being tapped for toe running into the Dip. Jockey Graham Lee never even thought about going for his whip as the colt came home in sixth place. He has the size and scope to do better next year.

FANNAAN (Trained by John Gosden)

John Gosden was bemoaning the early entry system for some of our big two-year-old races after this colt won the Houghton Stakes at Newmarket, suggesting if he had been able to make a later decision, Fannaan might have lined up in the Middle Park Stakes. That indicates he likes this colt and a shot at a 2,000 Guineas trial next year is on the cards.
