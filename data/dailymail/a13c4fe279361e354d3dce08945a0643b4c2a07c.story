A grandmother who was found stabbed to death in her own home had been ‘living in fear’ for years, but tragically the real danger may have been closer to home than she suspected.

Seven years ago Ruth Dodd spoke out about the fear she felt in her Townsville neighbourhood, as she endured relentless conflict with the family living next door.

However, it has been alleged that Ms Dodd, 71, was stabbed to death by her own daughter on Friday night in her home in Heatley, a suburb in Townsville in north Queensland.

Ruth Dodd had been terrified in her home, scared of an attack from her neighbours. Her own daughter is accused of being responsible for her vicious murder

Ruth Dodd, 71, was murdered in her home in Heatley, a suburb in Townsville. Here she is pictured in the kitchen of that home in 2009

Ruth Dodd had previously lived in fear due to ongoing altercations and arguments with her neighbours

Alva Ruth Dodd, 36, was arrested for Ms Dodd’s murder on Sunday night and later charged.

She appeared in a Townsville court on Monday and will remain in custody, with the matter adjourned until April 27.

Ms Dodd was advised to leave her home by police six years ago when she was allegedly harassed and abused by her neighbours over their children’s behaviour and an ongoing disagreement about a shared fence. 

The situation with her neighbours in 2009 was so severe that the grandmother said she felt so threatened she feared leaving her home.

She also had her home broken into eight separate times in 2010, despite a complex security system, and was concerned that police were not taking the matter seriously enough

Police advised that she leave her home. The grandmother and charity worker remained in the residence, which is now a crime scene as forensic investigators compile evidence at the site of the murder

In 2009 Ms Dodd explained that she was scared to leave her home as she feared an attack from her neighbour's children, who were known to thrown dangeous items at her, including steel bars

The grandmother's son Merv was very concerned about his mother's safety and tried to defend Ms Dodd against the neighbour's when they allegedly became aggressive

At her wits end, she reached out to A Current Affair for help, who came to her home and captured footage of the neighbour's vile treatment of the then 65-year-old. 

‘I’m scared of the children. I never know when one will be waiting around the corner to hit me when I walk out my door,’ she explained at the time.

However, the charity volunteer and cherished member of the community refused to leave her home. 

In 2010 she appeared in the Townsville Bulletin newspaper after her house was broken into on eight separate times.

A relative alleged that Ms Dodd knew who was breaking in, but although she took security measures to stop people from breaking in, it made no difference.

‘She said to me one day she didn’t think the police were taking her seriously,’ the relative told the told The Sunday Mail.

‘I said ‘if you don’t do anything you’re going to wake up and find yourself dead one day’.

‘They smashed her window, her kitchen bench. They even entered the house through the back through the toilet window.

‘They smashed the front door down. I saw all that when I was up there one day. It was always getting broken into.’

Her son Merv Dodd tried to defend his mother during her altercations with the neighbours.

He spoke to the media in 2009 about the serious concerns he held for her safety.

‘I’m extremely concerned, my mother is scared of (the neighbours) and I am afraid of her living alone,’ Mr Dodd tolkd

Items were hurled at her as she tries to work in her garden, with missiles including balls, rocks and even steel bars thrown over the fence, allegedly by her neighbours. 

The well-liked community volunteer had been warned by relatives to leave her home once and for all after threats and harassment from other family members.

The brutal murder shocked local residents as Ms Dodd, a mother of five, had lived in Townsville since the 1970s and was a volunteer for the Royal Flying Doctor Service for whom she had won many awards and accolades.
