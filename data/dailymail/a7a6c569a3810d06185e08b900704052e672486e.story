This is the incredible moment a teenager who underwent Turkey's first facial transplant sees his new face for the first time.

Ugur Acar, 19, suffered serious burns to his face during a house fire when he was just 40 days old.

He had cosmetic procedure to repair his face 23 days ago at Akdeniz University's School of Medicine in the south of the country.

Today, he tentatively looked into a mirror to see what surgeons had been able to achieve - and was impressed with the result.

He said: 'I give thanks to all my doctors. It couldn't be better.'

Mr Acar said he is now dreaming of getting married.

His face was freshly shaven before he looked into the mirror as he had been forced to grow a beard over the three weeks since the operation to avoid irritating his skin.

However, doctors warned him that he cannot make facial expressions for another six months.

Dr Omer Ozkan said: 'Don't do any mimics as nerve healing will take six months.

'You will laugh, cry and get angry after six months, OK?'

Doctors successfully transplanted tissue from the face of a 45-year-old donor to Mr Acar.

Israfil Kurtcepe, rector of the university hospital, said specialists will be at hand if he needs any support.

He said: 'Ugur was prepared for this process, and everything went well.

'He didn't need psychiatric or psychological care. We were just there for him to make sure that he didn't need any psychiatric assistance.

'We will continue to be there for him, and we will help him adopt his new life and talk with him about his personal problems, if there are any.'

Doctors said they are planning to discharge Mr Acar from hospital in 45 days.

Last month's surgery brought the number of face transplants carried out worldwide to 20.

The first such procedure took place in 2005, when a partial face transplant was carried out on a French woman named Isabelle Dinoire.
