Wojciech Szczesny has warned Arsenal's Premier League title rivals that the current Gunners squad is the strongest they will have ever faced this season.

Confidence is high at the Emirates after the FA Cup holders swept Manchester City aside 3-0 in an one-sided Community Shield on Sunday.

Szczesny, who played the duration of match at Wembley, believes Arsenal's transfer dealings this summer have strengthened an already talented squad.

Arsene Wenger has made five signings so far, with the £30million arrival of Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona whetting the appetite of many Arsenal fans for the new campaign.

'Looking at it on paper I think it is the strongest side we have had,' Szczesny told goal.com.

'Except for obviously Thomas [Vermaelen, who has moved to Barcelona] we have not lost any key players.

'Even if someone did leave on a free contract [Bacary Sagna], we managed to replace them with good players.

'So we are looking stronger and stronger and we are very happy with that.'
