The father of a South Carolina woman who went missing last month, wrote an emotional confessional about the experience of her sudden loss - sharing the last image she sent him the night before she disappeared.

Heather Elvis, 20, was last seen after being dropped off from a first date at her condo in Horry County in the early morning of December 18.

The next night, a police officer showed up at father Elvis family home, informing Heather's father Terry that her car had been found abandoned at a nearby boat landing.

The last time Mr Elvis had heard from his cosmetology-student daughter was the night of December 17, when she texted him a picture of her driving during her date.

Mr Elvis explained in an essay on xoJane that he has a manual transmission truck he had been saving to give to one of his daughters, but that neither of them had ever learned how to drive a stick shift.

At the end of her date, the man she was meeting offered to teach her how to drive his manual truck  in a mall parking lot and she excitingly sent the picture of her driving to her father to share the accomplishment.

The search continues: There is a $25,000 reward for Heather's return. A candlelight vigil will be held for her on Thursday

'It is the last communication I have had with my daughter, the last picture I have of her on my phone,' Mr Elvis said.

'I didn't talk to Heather about it, but she had a good time,' Mr Elvis added about the date. 'I didn't think much of it.'

Heather's disappearance remains a mystery, but Mr Elvis believes 'someone who she knew and trusted may have betrayed her'.

Mr Elvis never met the man who took his daughter out on a first date, but he has since been ruled out as a suspect after being questioned by police and passing a lie-detector test.

He said Heather's car was parked in the condo's driveway when he dropped her off around 2 or 2:30 am on the morning of December 18.

Since then, Mr Elvis has worked tirelessly in the police investigation and search for his daughter.

According to the Find Heather Elvis Facebook page, there is a $25,000 reward for Heather's return, $10,000 of which is coming from Mr Elvis and his family.

Earlier in January, police thought they had made a break in the case when they found a set of skeletal remains while searching for Heather - but the bones ended up belonging to a male and had been in the earth for at least 20 years. 

Mystery: Police have since ruled out Heather's date as a suspect after he passed a lie-detector test. He says he saw Heather's car parked in her driveway when he dropped her off around 2 or 2:30 on December 18

A prayer vigil will be held for Heather this Thursday as Horry County locals continue to volunteer their time to search for Heather.

In his essay, Mr Elvis writes that Heather's disappearance has taught him not to take his loved ones for granted since you never know when you might lose them.

'Hold your loved ones close, tell them how much you love them every day. Never let them doubt how much love you have for them so that if you are ever in the position I am in, you will be able to look in the mirror with less regret,' Mr Elvis advised.

Still, Heather's father remains optimistic that he will eventually find Heather.

'It has been 30 days of hell. But I am praying for a miracle. And I refuse to give up hope,' he wrote. 'We will find my daughter. Will will find Heather Elvis.'
