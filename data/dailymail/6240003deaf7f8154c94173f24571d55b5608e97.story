After spring break, California teacher Gary Sconce will return to teach as her true self, Karen Adell Scot.

The Yosemite High School 24-year science and multimedia teacher told family in April that she 'felt like a female trapped in a male body,' The Fresno Bee reports. She has since undergone hormone replacement therapy.

Scot, 56, told the paper that her gender dysphoria made her feel trapped.

'It’s like getting out of dark solitary confinement in prison where you never saw the light,' she said. 'You can’t believe that you actually are free ... People say it’s like a mental illness but it’s not ... It’s being your authentic self after being a fake you.'

'I knew I was a girl from my first self-aware thoughts,' she said, 'and I tried desperately each morning to wake up each morning as a female small child and it never worked.'

On March 19, Yosemite Unified School District Superintendent James Sargent wrote to parents of children at the high school, telling them that from April 22 onward, Sconce will be known as Ms. Karen Adell Scott, the paper reports.

The letter quotes California Education Code 220, which says that no person shall be subjected to discrimination on the basis of gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation.

Scot told the paper that she will not be 'pushing any social agenda' on her students and will continue to 'run a conservative and disciplined class.'

She also said she chose the name Karen Adell because it's what her mother would have named her had she been born with a female body.

Scot reportedly tried a variety of activities to convince herself of her masculinity, including college football, joining the military, becoming a sheriff's deputy, and teaching martial arts

Scot has been the recipient of multiple teaching awards and accolades and is a 30-year teaching veteran

In a letter to her colleagues, Scot wrote 'Consider: I have lost my marriage of 35 years to a magnificent, brilliant woman, am going to lose my house, and am spending (money) on serious and painful physical changes – including both medical and psychological services,' the paper reports.

'I have been shunned by those who used to be my friends, have been shunned by family, have had people try to cast demons out of me, have left my church of nearly 30 years, and have been scorned and laughed at by those who had for decades said they were my friends. Who would choose that?'

Yosemite High School Principal Randy Seals told The Sierra Star that the school is working hard to make sure the transition goes smoothly and that inappropriate behavior will not be condoned.

Scot has received multiple awards for teaching and has been a Who's Who in America's Schools teacher over ten times. She has also coached California state champions for Science Fair, Science Olympiad, and Odyssey of the Mind, the Star adds.

Scot is currently going through a divorce after 35 years of marriage to a 'magnificent, brilliant woman' and plans to legally change her name to Karen once it is complete.
