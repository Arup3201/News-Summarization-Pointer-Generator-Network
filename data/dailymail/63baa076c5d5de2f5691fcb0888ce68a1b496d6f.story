Although her ex-boyfriends reads like a roll call of Hollywood's hottest, when it comes to getting dressed, she doesn't do it for the men. 

Sharing her wardrobe secrets, she told the magazine: 'When I’m getting dressed, it’s always based on what my friend’s will think. They are my number one priority and the opinions of girls are more important to me at this point in my life.'

Speaking about those friends, she adds: 'My friends are the kind of people that have their own lives, and their own busy schedules, and that’s why we get along so well. 

'A lot of "celebrities" surround themselves with these very chic cling-ons who don’t really have much of a job or a passion, they follow around their celebrity BFF and provide constant affirmation for them and I’m really not interested in that kind of deal.'

Fashion's darling: Taylor, 24, has become something of a style chameleon in recent  months - and it's landed her the most glossy magazine covers 

Clearly it's paying off. Taylor's latest album has totted up 2m in sales (and counting) and she even landed a glossy Vogue cover last month.

As well as showcasing some serious sartorial prowess in recent months, Taylor has been experimenting with her beauty look, too. 

Perhaps she took some tips away from her covershoot for the fashion bible, where industry heavyweight Val Garland created her look.

Speaking about her fresh-faced glow, Val said: 'Mario Testino wanted to find a new way of seeing Taylor, he wanted to express another aspect of her personality - something really fresh and spontaneous.

'Taylor has really gorgeous skin and these really sparkly eyes so I thought it would be great to play up her healthy complexion.' 

The starlet has even speaheaded a new hairstyle: the wob. 

According to celebrity hairstylist Julien Farel, the wavy hairstyle, which is favored by the likes of Jennifer Lawrence, Beyoncé and Taylor, has seen many long-time fans of the lob giving their hairstyle an update and adding a bit of bounce and body in order to create a more modern and youthful look.

'There is a lot of sexy short hair on the red carpet now and I really adore it because it’s such a modern take on femininity,' the celebrity hair stylist and haircare creator told MailOnline.

So what is it about Taylor? Psychologist Linda Papadopoulos believes that much of Taylor’s appeal comes from the fact that she offers a change from over-sexualised stars such as Rihanna, Rita Ora and Nicki Minaj.

Stars who are as well known for dancing around in risque outfits as they are for their music.

‘I speak to a lot of young girls who don’t feel like they want to be that sexual and Taylor provides that alternative.

‘She bridges the gap. She says you can be sexy sometimes but you can also geek out and just have fun with your friends.’

Plus she works hard, ‘It also helps that she writes her own music. Young people are becoming incredibly savvy to the way in which in the music industry works and the smoke and mirrors but she has that authenticity.

‘You know you see some people telling young women to "do this" and "do that" but Taylor is just sharing her experiences. She’s very honest and open about that and that’s a lot of her appeal.’

Taylor recently announced her plans for a 1989 world tour. So far she has announced 57 dates across North America and Europe and she is set to perform live at the Victoria's Secret show in London next week.
