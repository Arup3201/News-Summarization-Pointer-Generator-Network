Southampton are poised to make a formal £8million offer for Cardiff City goalkeeper David Marshall.

The Scotland international was outstanding last season and Cardiff value him closer to £15m.

Southampton are also considering Fraser Forster at Celtic after enquiring about his price.

In demand: Southampton have been linked with an £8m bid for Cardiff goalkeeper David Marshall

The club are digging their heels in over the sale of Dejan Lovren despite the defender insisting 'his head is already at Liverpool' after he learned a £15m offer had been rejected.

'Tottenham are also interested but have yet to bid.

Lovren said: 'I'd gladly stay in Southampton if the club had any ambitions, if they kept the key players.

'Liverpool sent the offer and the club haven't informed me,' he said. 'Not even about the subsequent Liverpool bids. That wasn't right.

'I found out about the bid from other people which disappointed me and I realised I've got no business staying at Southampton. Frankly, my head is already at Liverpool.'

Heads gone: Dejan Lovren is ready to join Liverpool after criticising Southampton

FC Twente did not risk Dusan Tadic in a friendly yesterday against local amateur side vv Oldenzaal.

The 25-year-old is expected to join Southampton for £8.7m although Everton have shown a late interest.
