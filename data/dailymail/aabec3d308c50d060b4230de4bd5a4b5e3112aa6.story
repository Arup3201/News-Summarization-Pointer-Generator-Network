As outrage builds over the shock death of Melbourne Cup favourite Admire Rakti, the horse's jockey has paid tribute to the Japanese raider, which collapsed and died in its stall following the race. 

Jockey Zac Purton made an emotional statement about the Caulfield Cup winner's sudden death to the TVN Racing Network. 

'He gave me a great thrill at  Caulfield, for this to happen to him, it's not fair,' Mr Purton said.

Animal rights activists have seized on the opportunity to question the ethics of horse racing. It is the second horse to die at the Melbourne Cup in two years.

Verema was euthanised after it broke its leg in the 2013 Cup.  

Another horse, the outsider Araldo, was transported to University of Melbourne Veterinary Hospital for treatment after he injured his right hind leg after the race. 

Elio Celotto, the campaign director for the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses, blamed the racing industry for treating the animals poorly. 

'If these were human athletes, the sport would be banned,' Mr Celotto told Daily Mail Australia.  

In a statement, the RSCPA said horses were dying for our entertainment. 

'This is a tragic outcome for both horses and we expect there to be a full and transparent investigation undertaken into both incidents.

'Events like these are a stark reminder to the community of the real risks to horses associated with racing.'

'Sadly, injury and death are the price some horses pay for our entertainment in a sport that puts intense pressure on animals to perform to the limits of their endurance.

Racing Victoria's (RV) Head of Veterinary and Equine Welfare, Dr Brian Stewart, said: 

'It is with sadness that we confirm that Admire Rakti has passed away in his stall following the running of the Emirates Melbourne Cup.

'The exact cause of death is yet to be determined, although the circumstances of the horse's passing are very rare. 

'A post mortem will be conducted at the University of Melbourne Veterinary Hospital as is standard practice.

'Our sympathies are extended at this time to the owner Mr Kondo, trainer Mr Umeda and his staff who cared deeply for their horse and are naturally saddened by their tragic loss.'

Dr Stewart also advised that the Mike Moroney-trained Araldo suffered an injury to its right hind leg when it took fright upon returning to scale and kicked the fence.

The horse has been treated by the on-course veterinary team and has been transported by ambulance to the University of Melbourne Veterinary Hospital for further treatment and assessment.

Claire Fryer, a spokeswoman for PETA Australia, told Daily Mail Australia: 'People who care about horses should steer clear of horse racing.' 

Ms Fryer said horses routinely sustain catastrophic injuries or drop dead on the track.  

Animal rights group Voiceless tweeted: 'The story of Admire Rakti exemplifies everything that is wrong with the horse racing industry.' 

Dr Brian Stewart, the head of Veterinary and Equine Welfare at Racing Victoria, said the exact cause of Admire Rakti's death was yet to be determined.

'It is with sadness that we confirm that Admire Rakti has passed away in his stall following the running of the Emirates Melbourne Cup,' Dr Stewart said.   

The Victorian Racing Club led the tributes to Admire Rakti on Twitter, saying it 'expresses its condolences to connections of (the horse) following his passing'. 

Admire Rakti took out the Caulfield Cup in what was described as 'brilliant style' last month, and many Twitter users paid tributes to the horse's racing prowess. 

The Toodyay Race Course organisation, in WA, tweeted: 'RIP Admire Rakti - what a wonderful horse may he rest in peace.' 

Businessman Scott O'Neill wrote: '#AdmireRakti rip mate. So sad to see a sporting hero perish.'
