French artist Laure Prouvost has been named winner of this year’s Turner Prize for a video of a tea party.

The £25,000 award was presented by Irish actress Saoirse Ronan at a ceremony in Londonderry, Northern Ireland last night.

Miss Prouvost’s video, ‘Wantee’, was inspired by late German artist Kurt Schwitters, whose girlfriend was nicknamed Wantee as she repeatedly asked ‘want tea?’

The video installation called 'Wantee' by Laure Prouvost was described by judges as being both outstanding and moving

Miss Prouvost, 35, told the audience: ‘Thank you for adopting me, for having a French one, I feel adopted by the UK.’

Other
artists to be shortlisted for this year’s prize included David Shrigley
for his larger than life naked urinating male mannequin.

Show-goers were encouraged to take part by drawing the model and their efforts are displayed around the gallery.

Shrigley, whose cartoons have appeared in The Guardian Weekend magazine, is best known for his stuffed Jack Russell.

Standing on its hind legs, the dog holds a placard in its paws that declares: ‘I’M DEAD’.

Other
nominees included Ghanaian Lynette Yiadom-Boakye, who was the first 
black woman to be nominated, and German artist Tino Sehgal.

Established
in 1984, the Turner Prize is awarded to a contemporary artist under 50,
living, working or born in Britain, who is judged to have put on the 
best exhibition of the last 12 months.

Previous
winners of the prestigious prize include Tracey Emin, who won in 1999 
for My Bed, which  featured stained sheets surrounded by cigarette butts
and condoms, and Damien Hirst in 1995 for works including a cow and 
calf cut in half and preserved in formaldehyde.

The
exhibition for the Turner Prize, which has travelled outside England 
for the first time, will be staged in Ebrington barracks, a former 
military site, in Londonderry until January 5.

Lois
Rowe, programme director of fine art at Wimbledon College of Arts, 
University of the Arts  London, said that Miss Prouvost ‘was an 
exemplary artist for students to follow’.

She
added: ‘There is a real generosity and openness in the narratives she 
creates and her use of language and approach to situating objects is 
incredibly imaginative.’
