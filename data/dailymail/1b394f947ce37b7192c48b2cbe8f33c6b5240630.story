Louis van Gaal branded Chris Smalling ‘stupid’ for his sending-off in the Manchester derby defeat that consigned United to their worst start to a season in 28 years.

Sergio Aguero scored City’s 63rd-minute strike in the 1-0 win but the turning point came six minutes before half-time when Smalling lunged at James Milner to earn a second yellow card from referee Michael Oliver, having been cautioned earlier for needlessly blocking a clearance by goalkeeper Joe Hart.

‘In a derby you have to be careful — the second yellow card is a stupid yellow card,’ said Van Gaal. ‘The first I didn’t see but as a player with a yellow card you have to deal with that. You have to control your aggression. I said that to the players.

‘You cannot do what he has done. He said (sorry) and is very humble. You can only accept it. Nevertheless it is, in my opinion, not so smart.’

It is the second Sunday on the run that Van Gaal has accused one of his players of stupidity. He said the same about Robin van Persie last week after he was booked for removing his shirt while celebrating his late equaliser against Chelsea.

Van Gaal did, however, defend United midfielder Marouane Fellaini from accusations that he he spat at Aguero. Video footage online showed the Belgian standing over Aguero as the Argentine lay on the ground.

United’s manager said: ‘I have heard it is a question on social media but already he has said he is shouting and sometimes when you shout there is a little bit of saliva. I don’t think he is a spitting figure.’

City’s victory moved them six points behind leaders Chelsea, while United now have only 13 points from 10 games — their lowest total at this stage since Ron Atkinson was sacked this same week in 1986.

City’s fourth successive derby triumph means United are yet to win away under Van Gaal and are only five points above the drop zone. United’s defensive problems increased when Marcos Rojo was carried off with a dislocated shoulder, leaving Van Gaal short of options for Saturday’s home match against Crystal Palace.

Smalling, the third United player to be sent off this season, will be suspended while Phil Jones and Jonny Evans are still injured. United did rally late and forced Hart into two fine saves. But City had three penalty claims refused by referee Oliver during a heated match which also saw Hart seemingly touch heads with the official while appealing against a decision.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini would not criticise Oliver about the penalty decisions but said Rojo should have been sent off for bringing down Yaya Toure.

‘We played very well,’ said the Chilean. ‘We scored and in that moment we dropped back a bit more. We lost the high possession of the ball we had before. It is not the way we must finish games.’
