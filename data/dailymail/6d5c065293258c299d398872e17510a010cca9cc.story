A woman who hit and injured three freshman high school students  in a crosswalk was recording a video of her son at the time of the crash, court documents revealed.

Elizabeth Rachel Dove, 23, of Oregon struck the three girls in January from Centennial High School with her white Kia, and at the time was recording a 19-second video of her son who was sat in the backseat, according to police.

The young mother has been indicted on several charges including five counts of recklessly endangering, three counts of third-degree assault and one count of reckless driving, according to KATU.

Investigators found that Dove had used her phone immediately prior to the crash on January 15 when freshman Sarah Hollenbeck, 15, and her two unidentified friends, both 14, were leaving an after-school program (above scenes from the January crash as the girls lie in the street after being struck as students rush to help them)

Investigators found that Dove had used her phone immediately prior to the crash on January 15 when freshman Sarah Hollenbeck, 15, and her two unidentified friends, both 14, were leaving an after-school program. They were hit just outside of the high school in Gresham.

Following the crash, the three girls were taken to hospital where they were treated for injuries, and were later released, according to KPTV.

A status report from January revealed one teen girl suffered from a concussion and torn ACL, and the bone on her left knee was torn out; the second teen was left with a broken nose, a major concussion, bruises to her legs, feet and face, unable to walk due to pain in her ankle and lost a tooth; and Hollenbeck suffered from a fractured skull, pelvis and knee.

In the events leading up to the crash, Dove sent five text messages and received one, as well as had a phone call lasting seven minutes before recording the video, according to phone records included in a court affidavit from the Multnomah County court.

A second video follows shortly after lasting six seconds, which was also recovered showing the phone bouncing on the front passenger seat (above scenes from the crash)

During the 19-second video she recorded of her son, she is holding the phone with her left hand and making gestures with her right hand.

A second video follows shortly after lasting six seconds, which was also recovered showing the phone bouncing on the front passenger seat.

The report notes this is clearly when the crash occurred, as Dove is panicked and her child is heard crying in the background.

Police determined that Dove hit the teen girls 1.42 seconds after the video ended, and that they entered the roadway at the time when Dove 'appears to have no hands on the steering wheel'.

Lowvy Ma, who witnessed the crash, said he honked his horn when he realized that Dove was going to hit the girls.

He said he saw her car slow down for a few seconds before the teens were hit and he saw them 'go flying'.

Hollenbeck recalled how she woke up after being struck by the car and saw her two friends lying on the ground next to her, according to an earlier report by KGW.

'It was really scary because I saw both my friends being covered in a blanket and I thought they were dead,' she said.

Hollenbeck added: 'We were so lucky. I think the next time it could be fatal for someone.'

Dove got out of the car and waited at the scene until police arrived, and told responding officers she did not see the teens before the crash. She also admitted to phone use.

The young mother has been indicted on several charges including five counts of recklessly endangering, three counts of third-degree assault and one count of reckless driving (above the crosswalk where the incident took place)

Dove, who has been convicted previously for theft and ID theft, was arrested on March 4 but was released from jail, and now faces the several charges. 

There was no alcohol or drugs involved in the incident, according to police.

In Oregon, using cellphones while driving is against the law except for in cases when the driver is using a hands-free device and is over the age of 18.

Following the crash, the city has installed a rapid-flash beacon at the crosswalk.
