George Stephanopoulos has signed a new long-term deal with ABC News that will see him continue as co-anchor of Good Morning America

Following the highly-publicized departures of his Good Morning America male co-stars, George Stephanopoulos has signed a new long-term deal with ABC News that will see him continue as co-anchor of the breakfast show and presenter of the Sunday public affairs show This Week.

The recent defections of weather anchor Sam Champion and co-host Josh Elliot had made keeping Stephanopoulos at GMA a top priority for ABC News executives and they initiated early contract talks a couple of weeks ago.

Those talks have been concluded very quickly and to the satisfaction of Stephanopoulos who ran Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign back in 1992.

Details of his new deal haven’t been revealed reports The Hollywood Reporter, but Stephanopoulos was negotiated from a clear position of strength.

Co-anchor
 Robin Roberts signed a new long-term reportedly worth $14 million a 
year last December, while Lara Spencer was recently promoted to co-host 
in a $3 million a year deal.

Josh Elliott's walk out to join NBC Sports earlier this month was after they wouldn’t agree to his salary demands. Stephanopoulos' new deal is expected to be comparable to Roberts.

'This represents what he wanted - he is committed to GMA and This Week, and understands the power of those platforms,' ABC News spokeswoman Heather Riley told the Daily News.

The way they were: George Stephanopoulos is the last member of the GMA team pictured here to agree a new deal, while former male co-hosts Josh Elliott, top left, and Sam Champion, center, have departed

'We are thrilled that the team is locked in and that the deal was done so quickly and with such goodwill from all sides.'

The former White House Communications Director started working for ABC News as a political analyst after leaving the Clinton administration in 1996. 

In September 2002, he became host of This Week, and was officially named him Chief Washington Correspondent in 2005.

The appointment of the political hard-hitter at GMA in late 2009 surprised many but has proven to be a big success. The show has overtaken major rival Today and has its largest audience in more than 22 years.

New order: Michael Strahan, right, made his debut on GMA last week and joined Stephanopoulos, Robin Roberts, Lara Spencer, Ginger Zee and Amy Robach

Elliott's defection briefly left Stephanopoulos as the single male anchor on the program, until Michael Strahan made his debut last week. He has joined as a contributor and remains co-host of Live! with Kelly and Michael.

ESPN's Tony Reali was also named a GMA contributor on April 10. 

Stephanopoulos is the last member of the GMA team to agree to a new deal.

In recent months, the show replaced Champion, who joined The Weather Channel, with Ginger Zee and Elliott with Amy Robach who tweeted her congratulations on Thursday morning.

A big congratulations to @GStephanopoulos - here's to many many years working with the best @GMA #team,' she tweeted.

'We are united as a team and over the past few months we have 
not missed a beat - in fact our audience has only grown,' said Riley.

Stephanopoulos will also continue to host This Week on Sunday mornings, he first hosted the public affairs show in 2002
