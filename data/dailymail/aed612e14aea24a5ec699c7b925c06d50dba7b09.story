A 57-year-old woman drove herself to a hospital after she was mauled by a brown bear in Alaska while on a hike.

Wildlife troopers were notified on Tuesday afternoon that Thea Thomas, of Cordova, was attacked by the bear while hiking on Heney Ridge Trail in the Cordova area.

Thomas was badly hurt but her injuries are not thought to be life-threatening, according to troopers spokeswoman Megan Peters.

Speaking to ADN.com, she said: 'I hike those trails all the time'.

The trail ‘is probably the most common place over the 30 years I’ve lived there that I’ve seen bears,’ she said.

Ms Thomas said she was walking dogs on August 12 but they had ran out of sight when she heard growling. 

'Immediately I thought ‘That’s not a plane -- that’s something else,' said Thomas.

'He just started biting me. I’m yelling ‘No! No!’' she said.

She described the bear as standing almost seven feet tall on its two hind legs and as having a thick coat of fur.

'I kept thinking he was going to stop,' Thomas said.

Thomas said the bear walked away but then turned back moments later.

At one point she tried to get up but the bear stopped her.

'He wanted revenge; that’s what he acted like,' Thomas said.

In order to protect her head and neck, Thomas went into a fetal position with her right arm over her head.

'He took a pretty darn good chunk out of my right arm, my right leg, my right side,' she said.

Once the bear finally calmed down, she tried to escape.

'I’ve just got to start walking,' she thought.

She was bitten around seven times and the worst of the damage was on her back and inner thigh and was lucky that the bear didn't get any of her internal organs.

Thomas says she feels fine but that her deep wounds will take time to heal and she may eventually get plastic surgery.

Taking precaution: 'I will never go into the woods without bear spray, or a horn, or a gun, again,' said Thomas

She also said that she won't be hiking without protection next time and that she’ll think twice about bringing an animal with her.

'I will never go into the woods without bear spray, or a horn, or a gun, again,' she said.

Ms Peters, troopers spokeswoman, said: 'The
 trooper told me that when she checked herself into the hospital, he 
said it was almost like the people who were working on her were more 
shocked than she was.

'The trooper said she was very pragmatic and calm about everything.'

Thomas was listed as in a stable condition at an Anchorage hospital, where she was transferred after checking in at her local hospital.

Salmon were actively spawning in a nearby stream as Thomas hiked alone with her dog and a friend's dog, Peters said.

The dogs ran off, then returned shortly with the bear running after them.

After
 the attack, Thomas walked 1 ½ miles back to her truck. She found one of
 the dogs while walking back and the other dog was waiting at her 
vehicle.

After
 arriving in the local hospital, Thomas was eventually flown to 
Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage, about 150 miles northwest
 of Cordova.

Troopers said the trail is now closed for a week. There are no plans to look for the bear.

The
 attack did not appear to be predatory in nature, according to Peters, 
who noted the attack was likely prompted by the dogs in an area where 
salmon have already begun to die.'The
 thought process is that the bear was more than likely being irritated 
by the dogs and also protecting its food source,' she said. 'So it was a
 bear being a bear.'
