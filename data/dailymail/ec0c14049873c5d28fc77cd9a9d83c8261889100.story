A college student revealed that he slept in his car for a year in order to make ends meet.

Texas State University student Colin Ashby wrote in an essay for USA Today that he was cash-strapped before his freshman year and unable to live on-campus.

'While other freshmen were busy moving into their dorms, I sat in my car and duct-taped bed sheets to my car windows,' he wrote. 'For the rest of the day, I wandered around campus pretending to be excited about move-in day. When night hit, I reluctantly walked to the parking lot where my car was parked. Crawling into my back seat, I pulled up the sheets so no one could see inside the car and fell asleep.'

Because of his living situation, Ashby said he spent his time in the library and meeting with professors

Ashby wrote that he frequently spoke to professors at their office hours and went to the library, and worked at McDonald's between 9pm and 5am.

'Getting off work at 5am, I would take a small nap before waking up dreary eyed to head to my 8:00 a.m. classes,' he wrote.

In his essay, Ashby said that one upside was that '[d]ue to accumulating many college credits while in high school, I will be able to graduate with my bachelor’s degree this December after just two and a half years of college. Instead of the usual four (or five) years it typically takes.'

Ashby told ABC's Good Morning America he did not tell his recently-divorced parents what was going on, though he did tell two siblings. 

Success: Ashby will graduate from school in two-and-a-half years

Resourceful: Ashby used his time going to the library and visiting teachers

'They would have said, "School’s not the best option right now. You should just take time off to work and save your money,"' he told the news site.

Ashby still did his laundry and was able to bathe, ABC said.

'I had a fan I’d plug into my voltage outlet but it wouldn’t really help [with the heat],' he told ABC. 'There were nights I’d lose sleep because of it. It could get up to 100 degrees, and that’s without factoring in the humidity.'

ABC reported that Ashby lives with his brother.
