A couple with a combined love of collecting have turned their home into a time warp - full of artifacts from Victorian and early 19th century Britain.

Jackie and Graham Reed have spent their married life collecting items from a long lost era - including bicycles, furniture, clothes and prams.

The couple's collection spans centuries but both have a particular love of 19th century as well as pre and post war Britain.

The couple's collection spans centuries but both have a particular love of 19th century. Their kitchen cupboards are stuffed with packets of food from years past

Their collection now boasts around 100 bicycles - including Penny Farthings and Boneshakers.

The couple's 'history house' is also full of antique ornaments, clocks, plates, paintings and even tins and packets of food.

Mrs Reed, 57, a former office worker and housewife of many years, said: 'My husband started collecting bicycles when his aunt gave him one at the age of 16. 

'It's hard to say how many he has got now but I would say it is close to 100.

'The earliest bike he owns is the Boneshaker which dates back to 1868. The rest  of his collection of bikes dates all the way up to the 1960s.

'Graham's real interest is pre World War One and he has a number of bikes from before the war.'

Mr Reed, a retired social worker, started collecting bicycles when his aunt gave him one at the age of 16. The oldest in his collection is a Boneshaker which dates back to 1868

Mr Reed, 62, a retired social worker, often takes his penny farthing for a ride and has been known to cause a traffic jam from intrigued motorists taking a quick snap.

Mrs Reed said: 'Our collections reflect our interest in history. We buy items because we just like them, as individual items. We are really passionate about history and for me it is about learning as much as you can.

'Domestic history is my real love. I like to experiment and mess around with recipes from old magazines using historic cooking utensils. I also collect clothing and I just love to see tiny delicate repairs on Victorian baby bonnets and the hand stitching that would have taken so much time.

'All of my items are on display in the house and one piece that I love is my 1913 Hitchings pram. This pram is a lovely model and became a top ranking pram when Queen Victoria bought three of them.

The couple both do occasional talks about their collections and Mr Reed is considering what he can do with his many bicycles for the much anticipated Tour De France

Mrs Reed said: 'I love going to antiques centres, walking around and then something just clicks when you see it. It may cost £1, it may cost a lot more, but it's about buying a piece that tells me something about the history behind it'. Her blue dress is from 1914, the red garment dates from 1900

The couple don't own a computer and prefer the more personal approach to growing their collections

The couple had an eclectic mix of items in their home and say some range from old to newer items

'In my kitchen I have a 1947 pram which I have used for all my grandsons. I still take Archie out in it because he is still small enough. Some of my prams on display in the house have been paired with a doll from the same era.

'My mum liked my collection of prams. When she died she left me some money and I bought a pram out of that. Every time I see it I am reminded of her.'
