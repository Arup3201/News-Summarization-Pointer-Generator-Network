Islamic extremist Abu Qatada won £2,000 when the court ruled he was unlawfully detained. He is one of just 202 cases that have received money from Strasbourg

Britain has lost a staggering 202 European human rights cases several of which involved murderers, terrorists, paedophiles and rapists, it emerged yesterday.

Judges in Strasbourg handed the claimants taxpayer-funded payouts £1.7million which, with high legal costs, totalled £4.4million – an average of £22,000 a head.

Many applicants are of good character with no criminal connections. But recipients since 1998 include the traitor George Blake, extremist cleric Abu Qatada and the IRA killer dubbed Mrs Doubtfire.

The House of Commons figures fuelled fresh demands for Britain to pull out of the convention on which the European Court of Human Rights bases its rulings.

Soviet spy Blake, who was jailed for 42 years, one for each of the MI6 agents he sent to their deaths, was awarded £4,700 in 2006 because Britain stopped him profiting from the memoirs he wrote when he fled to Russia.The court ruled that this breached the double agent’s ‘right to free expression’.

Qatada, who was finally deported this year and was regarded as Al Qaeda’s ambassador in Europe, pocketed £2,000 because the court ruled he was unlawfully detained.

Kirk Dickson kicked to death a man who refused to give him cigarettes. But he won £18,000 from the court, which said he had been denied the right to father a child by artificial insemination.

Rupert Massey was jailed for six years for the abuse of three boys over a 14-year period. But he won £5,496 because he was ‘stressed’ after he waited four years for his case to reach court.

IRA killer Liam Averill was dubbed Mrs Doubtfire after escaping in drag from the Maze prison in 1997. He pocketed £5,000 in 2000 while still on the run because the court said it was wrong he had no lawyer for 24 hours after his arrest.

Traitors, murderers, rapists and terrorists have all received cash handouts

Tory MP Philip Davies called the shocking discovery an 'absolutely scandalous waste of money'

Somali paedophile Mustafa Abdi was sentenced to eight years behind bars for raping a child. Ministers spent more than a decade trying and failing to deport him, which allowed him to pocket £7,237 for being ‘wrongfully detained’.

The figures were obtained by Tory MP Philip Davies and placed in the House of Commons library.

Convicted paedophile Rupert Massey was awarded £6,000 by the European Court of Human Rights because his trial was delayed for too long

He said last night: ‘To me, it’s just an absolutely scandalous waste of money. I’m not aware of my decent law-abiding constituents running off to the European Court of Human Rights.

'It is a charter for illegal immigrants and criminals.

‘We’re in a situation where we’ve got pseudo judges who are making decisions about this country. These cases highlight what an absolute racket it has become. The sooner we scrap the Human Rights Act and leave the European Convention on Human Rights the better.’

When claimants fail to get a ruling in their favour in a British court, they can go to the ECHR and the UK Government is obliged to defend the case, effectively acting as a representative of the British courts system. Claimants can also go direct to Strasbourg, bypassing the UK's legal system.

That means that even when cases involve a claimant who is in dispute with a private company, the damages and compensation are still awarded against the Government – meaning taxpayers pay.

But many of the cases, where the Government has had to pay up, have set potentially damaging legal precedents that end up costing taxpayers millions more than the relatively modest compensation payments.

Other cases have overturned aspects of the stop and search powers and rules designed to prevent sham marriages.

The case which has sparked a rethink from ministers was that of rapist Robert Greens, who complained to the European Court that banning British inmates from taking part in elections is illegal.

The Government was ordered to pay Greens costs of £4,230 and to give all convicts the vote. But Parliament has voted to ignore that ruling and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has made clear that the Tories will make sure a new system they devise means Britain can refuse to obey.

Mr Grayling said: ‘As I’m sure the victims and their families feel, I find it very unpalatable to such sums are being handed over to some very unpleasant individuals.’

Traitor: George Blake was jailed for 42 years, one for each of the MI6 agents he sent to their deaths. In 2006 he was awarded £4,700 because Britain stopped him profiting from his memoirs

The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Many of the court's judges are political appointees, meaning they have no legal experience

The review he has set up will examine whether the Conservatives should ditch the convention and enshrine the Supreme Court in London as the ultimate arbiter of British law in a new Bill of Rights.

Dr Michael Pinto-Duschinsky, who sat on an official review of the humans rights system, warned that unless there is a change the Strasbourg court could dramatically increase the fines in future and Britain would be powerless to resist.

Britain could ‘stumble out of the European Union’ because too little has been done to make the positive case for Europe, Nick Clegg will warn today.

Issuing a call to arms, the Deputy Prime Minister will say a ‘coalition for the national interest’ is needed to make the case for Britain staying in the EU.
