Danny Cipriani faces Six Nations heartache on Monday, when England’s selectors meet for the final time before naming their squad for the last tournament before the World Cup.

With eight Tests left before the global tournament kicks off, Stuart Lancaster and his coaching team of Andy Farrell, Graham Rowntree and Mike Catt will convene to pore over a weekend of high-class European action before announcing a 33- or possibly 34-man squad on Wednesday for the RBS Six Nations, which kicks off in Cardiff on February 6.

The Mail on Sunday understands Northampton hooker Dylan Hartley will be in the squad after serving the fifth ban of his career but 27-year-old Cipriani looks almost certain to miss out despite a string of outstanding displays for Sale this season and a much-improved disciplinary record.

‘If he’s not picked this time, Danny won’t know what more he has to do,’ said a source close to the player.

With a possible move to French giants Toulon touted, the decision to omit the Sale playmaker may prompt him to move across the Channel next season and effectively end his international career.

Barring the probable return from injury of Ben Morgan (broken leg), Dan Cole (foot) and Manu Tuilagi — with the Leicester centre’s slower than expected recovery from a groin problem causing concern — the vast majority of players named on Wednesday can expect to be involved in the World Cup later this year. 

Conversely, those who miss out will need injuries or loss of form from their rivals to stand a realistic chance of featuring in the global tournament.

Harlequins flanker Chris Robshaw will captain a squad which will also include Exeter’s Jack Nowell and fit-again Northampton prop Alex Corbisiero.

With George Ford and Owen Farrell set to be named as the first-choice fly-halves, Lancaster must decide whether to opt for Northampton’s dependable Stephen Myler or the mercurial but potentially game-changing talent of Cipriani as the third-choice No 10.

The England head coach has spoken twice in the past fortnight with Cipriani — who has not started a Test match since 2008 — to assure him he remains in his plans. But on Saturday night he appeared certain to be named in the Saxons squad to face the Irish Wolfhounds on January 30 alongside rugby-league convert Sam Burgess.

The Mail on Sunday understands Cipriani could be invited to train with the senior squad but anything less than a full recall will leave a player many consider the most talented of his generation bitterly disappointed.

‘With Cipriani you either love him or your hate him,’ said England World Cup winner Kyran Bracken. ‘He’s mercurial and he’s different and he can do things on the hoof.

‘But the fact that Cipriani has had his chance over the years and probably hasn’t settled in the England shirt means I think Stuart Lancaster will go with someone like Myler, who is a bit safer.’

Hartley’s selection, following a three-week ban for elbowing Leicester’s Matt Smith before Christmas, will leave many baffled.

Last season Hartley admitted his already abject disciplinary record had left him in the ‘last-chance saloon’ after he was banned for 13 weeks for swearing at referee Wayne Barnes in the Premiership final. But, with his set-piece work still unrivalled among northern hemisphere hookers, pragmatism will win the day and the serial offender will return.

Nick Easter is another in-form player who needs a last-minute change of heart from England’s coaches to stand a chance of resurrecting an England career that saw him win the last of his 47 caps during the 2011 World Cup. He is still under consideration, but his chances look slim.

Exeter’s Thomas Waldrom looks assured of a place as a like-for-like replacement for the stricken Morgan, alongside Billy Vunipola.

The 36-year-old Easter, back in contention due to Morgan’s potentially World Cup threatening broken leg, has not been selected since Lancaster took over in 2012. But the experienced Harlequin has been the Premiership’s form No 8 this season and is desperate for one last shot at international rugby.

‘There is massive unfinished business for me as far as England is concerned,’ he said.

‘My hunger to play for England is as strong as ever, stronger probably. I believe that I am a much better player than when I was last capped.’

Exeter winger Nowell will be included, despite his club’s recent league slump, with a position on the right wing against Wales in his sights following an impressive return from a long-standing knee injury this season which required surgery over the summer.

Billy Twelvetrees’s alarming loss of form for Gloucester, and failure to convince on the international stage, leaves his position in jeopardy, with another Exeter youngster, Henry Slade, seen by many as the closest thing England have to Toulon’s Wallaby playmaker Matt Giteau.

The midfield remains Lancaster’s biggest headache. With Tuilagi sidelined, Luther Burrell and Brad Barritt are favourites to start in Cardiff.

‘I have an eye on the Six Nations,’ said Burrell. ‘Any young player who has had a taste of it and is on the fringes of potentially being back in the mix, it will be in the back of your head. I am so hungry for that opportunity again.’
