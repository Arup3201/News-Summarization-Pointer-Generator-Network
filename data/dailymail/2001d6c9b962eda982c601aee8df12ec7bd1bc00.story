Having it all: Not possible says Burberry CEO Angela Ahrendts who prefers to put her family first

One of Britain’s top female bosses yesterday warned other working mothers that ‘you can’t do it all’ – even though she gets up for work at 4.35am every day.

Angela Ahrendts, the high-flying chief executive of Burberry, said: ‘It is one of the most important parts of my job showing that you can’t do it all.’

The 53-year-old laid bare the compromises she makes to balance her job with her home life with three teenage children.

She described herself as having ‘three jobs’, as a wife, mother and chief executive of the fashion label.

On
most days, Mrs Ahrendts gets up – without an alarm clock – at 4.35am. 
She insists that she gets a headache if she sleeps for more than six 
hours. It is, she said, ‘my inspirational time, my time to find peace, 
to watch the sun rise’, which makes her into ‘a better executive every 
morning, calmer and nicer’.

She
added that she regularly declines sought-after invitations, such as the
opportunity to go to the Oscars ceremony, because family is more 
important.

Mrs Ahrendts, who
is married to her childhood sweetheart, Gregg, tries to limit herself 
to one night out a week, and also to make sure that she is home by 
Friday night when she is travelling.

She
said: ‘It is my job to set an example. We have a lot of working women 
here [at Burberry] and I always tell them they are mothers first.

‘Those
children are their legacy and they have partners and that’s a big 
obligation . . . I’ve never gone to the Oscars because I can’t afford 
another week away.’

She 
added: ‘It is not more important than my husband. It is not more 
important than my kids. It is not more important than Burberry right 
now.

'Those are choices 
that everybody makes. I’m here to run Burberry and I’m here to be a 
really great wife to my husband. And we have three amazing teens so 
that’s three really big jobs.

‘I don’t want to be a great chief executive without being a great mum and a great wife.’ 

Her
comments may reassure working mothers who feel forced to make tough 
choices between pursuing more senior roles at work and spending time 
with their families.

Mrs 
Ahrendts is one of a handful of female chief executives in Britain.  The
American joined Burberry in January 2006, and became chief executive 
six months later.

Last 
year, she was the highest paid chief executive of any FTSE 100 company, 
the first woman to top that elite league table, with a total pay package
of £16.9million.

While her
basic salary was £1million, the largest chunk came from selling 
£11.9million of her shares in the firm, built up over several years. Her
pay has dropped to £3.3million, including a basic salary of £1million 
and a bonus of £1.5million, according to the company’s latest annual 
report.

It is an extraordinary rise for a woman from the remote town of New Palestine, Indiana, which has a population of 2,000.

As
one of six children growing up in cramped conditions, the young Mrs 
Ahrendts used any small space she could to express her creativity.

Her
older sister Carrie once said: ‘There wasn’t much privacy. So, when she
was ten, Angela took over the little space below the stairwell, the 
place where you put the coats.

‘She
installed black lights and put in shelves, where she lit candles she’d 
hand-dipped. It was famous in the neighbourhood. Everyone came to see 
Angela’s place.’

British brand Burberry, which has its  headquarters in London and is listed on the London Stock Exchange, was founded in 1856.
