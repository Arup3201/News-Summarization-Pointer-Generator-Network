A group of homeless people are living like kings after taking up residency in abandoned mansions and luxury hotels in the wake of the Christchurch earthquake three years ago.

The earthquake killed 185 people and severely damaged the New Zealand city in February 2011.

But the homeless population who previously slept on the banks of rivers and on the streets say the devastating natural disaster was the best thing that could have happened to them.

A group of homeless people have taken up residency in abandoned mansions and luxury hotels in the wake of the Christchurch earthquake in February 2011

'After living on the street for 20 years, we're now tasting what it's like to live like kings. We're sleeping in fancy sheets, drinking champagne and living in mansions... and we're f****** loving it,' one the men said.

'We felt like the poor have come rich overnight.'

Their new and luxurious living opportunities are the subject of a three-minute Loading Docs documentary titled Living Like Kings.

The homeless men say there's nothing wrong with the 'mansions' even though walls have been reduced to rubble

The men were filmed proudly showing the abandoned houses where they now squat and taking advantage of the 'posh' facilities. 

One of the men took great delight in using exercise equipment while another popped a bottle of champagne.

Many of the houses still have furniture from previous tenants who were forced to flee the earthquake and failed to return because of structural damage.

The men were taken by the 'really poshy beds' considering some of them have been sleeping on the streets for years

'Some of these places there's hardly anything wrong with them,' one of the men said, despite one of the walls near him being reduced to rubble.

'They are flash houses – they've got lounge suites (and) champagne on the tables where they left them.

'(They've got) really poshy beds. I haven't been on a bed for a long time.'

Many of the men have been homeless for 20 years and say living in the earthquake effected houses 'is like Christmas' to them

The homeless say even though there was devastating trauma from the earthquake, it made their world very different

Even though many of the buildings are dilapidated, the homeless said they were getting a taste of how the other half live

Even though many of the buildings are dilapidated, the homeless said they were getting a taste of how the other half live.

'It's like Christmas to us,' they said.

'I think (people) take the comfort for granted. We're starting to get a taste of your world.

'Regardless of the shaking and trauma it made our world a lot different than what it was.

'I could handle the earthquake every day, personally.'

One man says he can now go to pubs he previously wasn't allowed in and has even taken to riding his horse through the abandoned streets

Filmmaker Zoe McIntosh was motivated to make Living like Kings after hearing about the group of men squatting in mansions post earthquake.

'I loved the immediate contrast within that scenario and was curious to know whether in fact there were any other positive stories that came out of the devastating disaster of the Christchurch Earthquake,' she said.

'The biggest pleasure was meeting the characters in Living like Kings. They're such a kind-hearted and generous group of people.

'They had so many more interesting stories and facets to their personalities that I couldn't include within the three minutes.'
