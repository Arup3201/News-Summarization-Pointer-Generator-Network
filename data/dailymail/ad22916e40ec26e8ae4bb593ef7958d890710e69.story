An outbreak of the winter vomiting bug has hit passengers on board a luxury cruise ship for a festive tour of Europe's Christmas markets.

At least 150 of the almost 2,000 holidaymakers sailing on P&O's Oriana are reported to have been taken ill.

One passenger, who claimed crew members had ignored the plight of those stricken by the bug, described the trip as 'a cruise to hell'.

Passengers also claim they have been told that if they catch the virus it is their own fault for not being clean enough

Retired fireman Dave Stringer, 57, of Walsall, West Midlands, told the Sun newspaper: 'There might be a riot because the captain and crew just refuse to listen.

'We'll refuse to disembark unless we get some answers,' he said.

Another tourist described the trip as a 'nightmare' in a review posted on a travel website.

The passenger, writing under the user name Gibbons, described how corridors and toilets on board the liner 'smelt strongly of sick'.

'We just wish we had never booked,' the review went on.

Passengers are understood to have begun falling ill within hours of the liner setting sail for a tour of the Christmas markets of Zeebrugge, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Oslo and Hamburg on December 4.

The ship is due to dock at 
Southampton tomorrow.

While passengers tourists on board claimed hundreds of people had been affected by the bug, P&O has said just nine cases of norovirus had been confirmed on Oriana.

It said enhanced sanitation protocols had been employed in response to the situation.

Sickness: Earlier this year passengers on board the Fred Olsen liner Boudicca had their trip to the Canary Islands ruined by a suspected norovirus outbreak

In May this year around 170 passengers on board luxury cruise liner the Boudicca had their dream holidays ruined by sickness.

The Fred Olsen owned ship was greeted by NHS staff and ambulance crews when it docked in Scotland after a 13-day tour of the Canary Islands that was marred by a suspected norovirus outbreak.

In February 3,000 passengers on board the Crown Princess had their Caribbean trip cut short when the Princess Cruise liner was ordered back to port after the vomiting bug swept through the ship.

Just a week earlier two other Princess Cruise ships had been struck by the highly contagious illness, which causes nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea.
