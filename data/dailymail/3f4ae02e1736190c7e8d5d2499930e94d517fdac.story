Think heading into the wild is the best way to steer clear of technology? Think again.

For those who can't face social media exile when they head to the cottage, lake or woods, Parks Canada said it will offer Wi-Fi in some of its spectacular outposts.

It claims that, in the digital age, sending a tweet could replace writing a postcard around a campfire.

Canada Parks has announced plans to roll out Wi-Fi services to a select few of its 44 national parks, 167 historic sites and four marine conservation areas such as the Bay of Fundy (pictured). The move is designed to make nature walking and exploring appeal to a younger generation who like to post to social media sites

Canada Parks is a federal agency that runs 44 national parks and 167 historic sites, from the Bay of Fundy on the Atlantic to Baffin island in the Arctic.

Parks Canada is an agency of the Government of Canada.

According to its website, it ‘protects and presents nationally significant examples of Canada's natural and cultural heritage.’

It also ‘fosters public understanding, appreciation and enjoyment in ways that ensure their ecological and commemorative integrity for present and future generations.’

The agency was formed on 19 May 1911.Its headquarters are in Ottawa, Ontario.

It has 4,000 employees and an annual budget of about $500 million (£300 million).

In total it runs 44 national parks, four marine conservation areas, one national landmark and 167 historic sites.

It said they want to appeal to those who may not be able to embrace old-school quiet solace without posting about their trip in real-time.

For now, Parks Canada will outfit 15 to 20 of its sites, in a trial phase, to see how it goes, said representative François Duclos.

‘Canada is a very big country, and it has become very urban. And for young people from cities, things are different,’ Duclos said.

He noted that some people were also required to stay in constant contact with their workplaces, even while whale-watching or on a break from hiking.

The goal is to bring 75 of its sites online with Wi-Fi in the next three years.

By the end of this year, the agency hopes to have at least 25 hotspots up and running.

But they are not intended to distract people from taking in the beauty of their surroundings.

Rather, Parks Canada wants to attract a younger generation by giving them the chance to share the experience more easily with others.

And the hotspots will be limited to camping areas, with more remote places left free of Wi-Fi interference.

Is this the future of camping? According to Andrew Campbell, Vice-President of Canada Parks, sending a tweet or posting a status to Facebook is the 'digital way' of sitting around a campground and writing a postcard

‘When you start to look at the hotspot and how wide they’ll range, you’re not going to be on top of the mountain and on the middle of the glacier and getting Wi-Fi service,’ Canada Parks Vice-President Andrew Campbell told the Calgary Herald.

‘It’s going to be around your campground at night where you’re going to communicate to your friends and family in ways that a lot of people do today, through Facebook or Twitter, putting your Instagram photo up.

'People used to sit around their campground and write postcards. I guess this is the digital way of doing that.'

The various sites, parks and areas that Parks Canada manages are visited by about 20 million people a year.

Many of the locations, however, are devoid of 3G or 4G coverage, leaving campers with no means of communication with the outside world.

In addition to making their experience easier to share, the hot spots could also help in emergency situations.

Parks Canada says the Wi-Fi will be free of charge in most places, but in some areas where it is harder to install they may charge a fee.
