Ann Pewter, 74, was killed alongside her two dogs

A wife and her two dogs drowned in their car after her husband got out to take a photo but hadn't put the handbrake on properly.

The car, containing Ann Pewter, 74, and her pets rolled down a slipway into the river Fal in Cornwall. It floated for several minutes, but Mrs Pewter tried to save the dogs rather than leave immediately.

David Pewter, 76, who had used the handbrake but only moved it up to the second of six notches, was left watching in horror as the car sank into the river with his wife and the animals inside.

The accident took place at the King Harry Ferry crossing, near Trelissick, on March 20 last year.

Mr Pewter, a retired electrical engineer, and other bystanders tried to help, but were unable to reach Mrs Pewter.

The couple, of Tavistock, Devon had visited St Just in Roseland Church near Truro before the tragic accident, the inquest in Truro, Cornwall, was told.

Deputy coroner for Cornwall Mr Barrie van den Berg, recorded a verdict of accidental death, and said that Mrs Pewter died from drowning.

Mr Pewter told the hearing: 'We left the church before 4pm and made and began making our way back and drove along the hill and down to the ferry and for some stupid reason I got out of the car.

'I was about to take a picture and to my amazement the car started moving slowly forward and I couldn't catch it.

'The handbrake was on. I put it into gear and I can't think what happened. The next thing I know it rolled slowly down into the water. It kept on rolling. It just floated and then it disappeared.'

The inquest heard rescuers dived in to help but could not save Mrs Pewter or the couple's dogs, described by Mr Pewter as 'members of the family'.

Garrick Royle, operations manager of the King Harry Ferry, heard the car hit the water from the opposite bank.

Slipway: The car had slid down as the handbrake had not been applied strongly

He rushed over in a small boat to help, along with mussel diver Matt Vernon. Mr Vernon dived 12 times into the murky water, but was unable to help.

Mr Royle said: 'I heard a crash and looked behind me and saw the car I saw it splash, it was quite a big splash.

'I could see the passenger window open and it was floating still quite high. There was a lady in an orange jumper who had climbed back onto the seats.

'I shouted and there was no response. It floated for four minutes before it went down.

Operation: Rescue boats and the fire service were dispatched to try and save Mrs Pewter, but they unable to reach her in time

'The window was open and I was really 
confused why she wasn't getting out but it turns out the dogs were in 
the back and she was probably trying to get to them.'

Selfless: The inquest heard that Mrs Pewter climbed onto the back seat of the car to save her dogs rather than attempting to leave

Craig Jenkins, who was also waiting for the ferry, had parked in front of the couple's car and watched it roll past.

He said: 'I saw something in my rear view mirror and I moved forward a few feet. I saw the car go past me and Mr Pewter chasing the car. It then landed in the water.

'I could see the silhouette of a person through the back window leaning towards the back.'

Rescue teams from the Navy, coastguard, RNLI, police, fire and ambulance personnel arrived soon after but Mrs Pewter died along with her two dogs.

The car was winched back on to the 
slipway and rescue workers immediately draped a green tarpaulin over the
 vehicle while Mrs Pewter and her pets were recovered.

She was later declared dead at Royal Cornwall Hospital at Truro.

Mark Richards, a forensic vehicle examiner for Devon and Cornwall Police, inspected the vehicle after it was recovered.

He said the car was found turned off with the handbrake applied two out of six notches - not hard enough to hold the vehicle on the sloping slipway.

He said: 'The ignition was on the off position and the parking brake was applied two out of six notches. The transmission was in neutral.'

Recording an accidental death deputy coroner for Cornwall Mr Barrie van den Berg, said Mrs Pewter had died from drowning.

He said: 'It's clear that what's happened is tragic accident. It rolled into the river and it's understandably affected everyone that was there.'

The King Harry Ferry connects St Mawes and the Roseland Peninsula with Feock, Truro and Falmouth and is one of only five chain ferries in England.
