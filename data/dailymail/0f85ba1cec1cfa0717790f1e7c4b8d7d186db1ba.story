A man cut off his own testicles and stormed into a church shortly before a couple were due to be married.

Reverend Bob Wallace and a florist were making preparations for the wedding ceremony at Hutton All Saints Church in Essex when the man burst in around 12.25pm.

They realised the man had injured his genitals and managed to stop wedding guests from entering the church while they waited for police to arrive on September 14.

A man is believed to have cut off his testicles before bursting into All Saints Church in Hutton, Essex, shortly before a couple were due to get married

Rev Wallace told the Huffington Post UK: 'Somebody came into the church 
having self harmed outside.

'Guests started to arrive for the wedding but were told they were not allowed to go inside.'

One of the guests told the Brentwood Weekly News: 'There was blood all over the floor just outside the church. When I went
in there it was like someone had been murdered. There was blood 
everywhere.

'The vicar knew of the man and said he had come into 
the church as they were setting up. He said the man had chopped his 
testicles off with a pair of scissors and was going bezerk, chucking 
chairs around. I’m surprised he didn’t pass out.

'When I went in 
the church, I saw something on the floor which I could only describe as 
flesh, which I thought was part of his arm but that was one of his 
testicles.'

Emergency: The unnamed man was taken to Basildon Hospital in Essex to be treated for his injuries

The vicar called 999 and police and an ambulance attended the scene.

A spokesman for Essex Police said: 'Police were called by the ambulance service to All Saints Church, in Church Lane, Hutton, at around 12.25pm on September 14.

'A man with mental health problems was found in the church with serious injuries.

'He was taken to hospital to be treated for his injuries, which police investigations have led them to believe were self-inflicted.

'He was then referred for a mental health assessment.'

The wedding went ahead half an hour later with the bride said to be unaware of the incident.
