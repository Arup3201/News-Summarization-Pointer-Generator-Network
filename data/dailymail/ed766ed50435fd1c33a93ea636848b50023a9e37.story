A fire chief has been forced to apologize after being pictured with firefighters dressed in sombreros and fake mustaches at a charity fundraiser taco stand.

Los Angeles Fire Chief Brian Cummings said he was sorry for posting the 'insensitive' picture to his Twitter account earlier this month.

The picture, which was posted on June 6, 
showed the fire chief wearing a sombrero, next to three firefighters dressed as stereotypical Mexicans.

After complaints he removed the picture from Twitter and posted: 'I sincerely apologize for any 
insensitivity or disrespect to anyone offended by posing for the photo 
from the Hope for Firefighters event.'

Yvonne Griffin, who takes photographs for the fire department, also removed the picture from her site.

Battalion Chief Armando Hogan said people at the event dressed in costumes inspired by the culture of the food they were serving.

However, some people felt the image of the taco stand endorsed ethnic stereotypes.

'The chief plans to meet with community 
members so that we establish a dialogue so that situations like this do 
not happen again,' Chief Hogan told CBS Los Angeles.

Fire Chief Cummings had posted the picture along with several others from the street festival, where the city's fire departments serve food to raise money for Hope for Firefighters.

Several departments had dressed up as characters from Top Gun, the Hawaiian Islands and the reality show Duck Dynasty as part of a fancy dress contest, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The main part of the annual event, where companies take part in physical challenges faced by firefighters, is the cooking contest where 25 fire departments compete against each other.

As well as raising money, firefighters compete for the bragging rights to having their food judged as Best Dessert and Best Food, Los Angeles Downtown News said.
