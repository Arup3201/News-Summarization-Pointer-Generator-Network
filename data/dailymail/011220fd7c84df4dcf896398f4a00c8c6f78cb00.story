For the first time in millennia, the average level of carbon dioxide has topped 400 parts per million (ppm) for an entire month.

April’s carbon dioxide readings come less than a year after scientists warned that the amount of the gas in the Earth’s atmosphere could surpass the 400ppm marker and stay there.

The gas is considered by many scientists to be responsible for global warming and has consistently breached the mark for a month – likely for the first time in 800,000 years.

An unfortunate first: For the first time in human history, the average level of carbon dioxide has topped 400 parts per million (ppm) for an entire month. Many scientists think that the burning of fossil fuels and other material (pictured) is responsible for global warming

Climate change is already having an impact on every part of the US, according to a doom-laden report published by the Obama administration earlier this week.

The third U.S. National Climate Assessment says the number and strength of extreme weather events have increased over the past 50 years.

President Obama is set to use the paper to convince the American public on the need for a crackdown on greenhouse gas emissions.

The report, compiled by 300 experts and released by the White House, said: ‘Climate change, once considered an issue for a distant future, has moved firmly into the present.

'More than half the US population lives in coastal areas that are ‘increasingly vulnerable’ to the effects of climate change, the report said.

And efforts to cut emissions so far are ‘insufficient to avoid increasingly negative social, environmental, and economic consequences’, it concluded.

April’s average carbon dioxide reading was 401.33ppm, according to scientists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego.

The institution is the custodian of the longest continuous record of carbon dioxide measurements, which were started in the 1950s by Charles David Keeling on the Mauna Loa observatory in Hawaii, USA Today reported.

The ‘Keeling curve’ measurements are thought to be representative of carbon dioxide levels around the world.

Rising levels of the gas in the atmosphere are thought to be caused by the burning of fossil fuels and are claimed to be responsible for the warming of the planet.

Based on ice core samples  from the 
Antarctic ice sheet that preserve samples of old air, experts from 
Scripps said that carbon dioxide levels did not breach 300ppm prior to 
the industrial revolution for the past 800,000 years.

Earth probably had carbon dioxide 
levels of 280ppm before the Industrial Revolution experts said, and the reading was 316ppm when the Keeling curve began in the 1950s.

It's getting hot in here: Rising levels of the gas in the atmosphere are thought to be caused by the burning of fossil fuels and are claimed to be responsible for the warming of the planet (illustrated). The Earth probably had carbon dioxide levels of 280ppm before the Industrial Revolution experts said

However, while carbon dioxide levels are expected to remain consistently above 400ppm throughout this month, scientists expect them to drop slightly when plants die in autumn.

It is thought that Earth’s levels will hover above the 400ppm level for good in the next few years.
