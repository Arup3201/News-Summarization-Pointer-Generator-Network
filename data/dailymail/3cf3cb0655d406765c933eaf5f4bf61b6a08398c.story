A Victoria water tower originally built to service a psychiatric hospital has gone up for sale for £1.25million after being converted into a three-bedroom apartment.

The Grade II listed Landmark Tower spans eight floors, each offering panoramic views over London, with more than 100 steps leading to the top - although it has also been fitted with its own lift.

It is now on the market for the first time since it was converted into a 170ft-tall home 12 years ago.

Set within a gated development in Woodford Green, north east London, the unusual property is being sold by Hunt Property Services.

The tower was originally built in 1893 to service Claybury Hospital which was closed in 1996 and subsequently turned into luxury flats. The water tower remained untouched until it was remodelled in 2002.

Hayley Hunt, director of Hunt Property Services, said: 'The Landmark Tower is a landmark in every sense. It can be seen for miles around and is the focal point of what has become one of the most prestigious addresses in the south east.

'Whoever buys this property will own a part of history.'
