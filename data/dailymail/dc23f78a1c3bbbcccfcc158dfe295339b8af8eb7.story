An Edwardian cul-de-sac on the Devon coast has been dubbed Britain's most dangerous street amid fears one house after the other is collapsing into the sea.

The sprawling 90-year-old houses in Redcliffe Road, Torquay, have been rocked by a series of devastating landslides which saw one home fall over the cliff edge and others evacuated over safety fears.

Coastal erosion has meant that the once-elegant family homes are at risk of falling down, with one evacuated by Torbay Council and the garden of another fenced off because it is judged at risk of falling 150ft into the waves below.

Redcliffe Road in Torquay has been dubbed the most dangerous street in Britain after one house fell into the sea and another was condemned after a series of devastating landslides

This shot of the cliff-top cul-de-sac shows the house at the end that has already tumbled into the sea, and a neighbouring house which is deemed to be at risk of the same fate

The homes are said to be worth up to Â£360,000, and were built in the 1930s offering breath-taking views across the English Channel.

But over the last few months, landslides have turned one home into a heap of bricks and wood dangling over the cliff edge, while a neighbouring house has been deemed too risky to live in.

The street has become so notorious, it is attracting crowds of tourists - many just children - curious to see the cul-de-sac that is falling into the sea. 

Torbay Council has now warned sightseers to stay away, for their own safety, and asked residents to work together to keep the gawkers out.

A spokesman said: 'Following the recent collapse of a property and ongoing concerns about cliff stability we are taking steps to ensure public safety.

'This includes requiring owners of properties at the seaward end of Redcliffe Road to take appropriate measures to prevent access to adjoining land approaching the cliffs.

Dangerous ruins: Ridgemont House, in Torquay's Redcliffe Road, collapsed and crumbled into the sea earlier this year because of coastal erosion

'We would strongly advise parents to ensure their children do not go on to the private land and put their safety at risk.'

A total of 100,000 tonnes of earth have come crashing down from Babbacombe's crumbling cliffs in recent months.

The first house to fall victim was sprawling Ridgemont House, which has now almost completely disappeared over the edge.  The mangled mansion became infamous because it was declared unsafe just one week after being sold at a blind auction.

The six-bedroom pile was bought for Â£155,000 in February 2010 via a telephone bid by a woman from London who had never been there.

Police officers in Devon and Cornwall say the influx of sightseers is not only dangerous, but adding to the anguish of those still living in the street's 16 remaining homes.

Such is the street's notoriety, crowds of sightseers, many of them children, have flocked to the cul-de-sac to see the houses still at risk

Police say sightseers are putting their own safety at risk by visiting the crumbling clifftop street

Police Constable Lee Metherell warned: 'Lots of youngsters are gaining access which will undoubtedly end fatally if we don't stop it.  You can clearly see that one slip on the uneven ground will most certainly lead to your death.

'Please keep out if you don't want to die.'

PCSO James Milton added: 'We just don't want a group of drunk kids going in their at night.

'The gardens have been totally undermined. One wrong foot in the dark and you're gone.  I'm no geologist, but it looks as if there will be more movement.'

The houses in Redcliffe Road were built 90 years ago so residents could enjoy far-reaching views across the English Channel

Torbay Council is to replace the 'road closed' sign at the seaward end of the street with a permanent metal barrier.

Local councillor Alan Faulkner said: 'We have been meeting with residents and they have been issued with a letter about our intentions.

'For safety reasons, we cannot have people wandering up there looking around.

'We have to protect people who live there and make sure that onlookers don't keep going up there. It is a nightmare for them and we have to put this to bed once and for all.'
