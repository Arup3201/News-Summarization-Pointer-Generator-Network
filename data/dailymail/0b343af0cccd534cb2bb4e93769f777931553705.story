A painting that British street artist Banksy donated to a New York City Housing Works thrift shop last month recently sold at auction for $615,000 dollars to a bidder named gorpetri.

After discovering the artist behind their latest acquisition, the thrift shop, which benefits the homeless and those suffering from HIV/AIDs, decided to sell the painting at auction.

Bidding started off at $74,000 but sold way above that at $615,00.

'The Banality of the Banality of Evil': Banksy's painting of a Nazi officer into a landscape of a mountain lake was recently sold for $615,000 at auction. That's the most expensive item ever sold a New York City Housing Works thrift shop

After the auction the thrift shop expressed their gratitude to the elusive artist on Twitter.

'$615,000! On behalf of our clients, staff & others living with HIV/AIDs, thank you, thank you, thank you #banksyny'

'This marks the highest revenue in the history for any one item sold by Housing Works in any of its 12 thrift shops or online,' Rebecca Edmondson, director of public relations told Gothamist.

The serene landscape of a mountain lake was purchased from the store on twenty-third street about two months ago and then returned with an added detail - a Nazi officer sitting on a bench, taking in the scenery.

Doing good: The original landscape was purchased at the thrift shop a few months ago and then returned with the Nazi addition. Once the store figured out that it was a Banksy original they put it up for auction to raise money for their charity

Seeing art: Fans of Banksy clamored in and outside the store to see the work of art

Banksy claimed the work on his Instagram account last week during his October residency in New York.

He titled the work 'The Banality Of The Banality Of Evil' on his website.

He also added his signature beneath that of the original artist, K. Sager.

A spokesperson from Housing Works has confirmed the sale and said that they had no idea who the man was when he dropped off the painting.

'I don't know all the details, it was all done very secretively. But someone came in and dropped it off as an anonymous donation,' Housing Work's Rebecca Edmondson told The New York Post.
