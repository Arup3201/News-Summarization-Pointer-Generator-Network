Marco Pierre White’s flagship restaurant in Birmingham has been given a zero food hygiene rating from environmental health officers.

The four-star Marco Pierre White Steakhouse, which is on the 25th floor of The Cube, although it has now been revealed they failed a visit by the Food Standards Agency in March.

The abysmal rating relates to either poor standards of hygiene structure, confidence in management or a combination of these factors and now means urgent improvement is necessary.

A restaurant spokesman has confirmed the rating, but said staff are working with the council to address the issues

The restaurant boasts stunning views of Birmingham, and costs around £50 per head.

A Birmingham City Council spokeswoman said: 'Marco Pierre White was informed their FSA rating would drop and it has been published on the FSA website.

'A certificate and window sticker confirming their zero rating was sent to the restaurant on March 25, 2014.'

Despite the bad review, a spokesman from Marco Pierre White said they have acted on what needed addressing and continue to work closely with the council.

The spokesman said: 'We can confirm that we received a visit from the Environmental Health Department of Birmingham City Council earlier this year.

'The feedback was provided in an informal manner by the EHO with some recommendations.

'These were acted on by the management team and subsequent revisits have been very positive.

'We continue to work closely with Birmingham City Council and have appointed a third party food safety consultant to ensure we remain up to date with the rigorous industry regulations and the ongoing changes in legislation and practice.'

White trained with Albert and Michele Roux at La Gavarouch and Albert once described him as 'my little bunny'

The zero rating will remain valid, until the date of the next inspection, which could be between six and 18 months’ time.

The restaurant can call inspectors back in the meantime if staff believe standards have improved, but so far the FSA have not revisited.

The Marco Pierre White Steakhouse joins a list of 140 eateries in Birmingham with a zero rating.

The Birmingham City Council spokesman added: 'In Birmingham most food business operate to a good standard, but if they fall below satisfactory standards, our officers carry out revisits and take proportionate enforcement action to ensure that standards are improve.

'Where premises pose an imminent risk to health - eg where there is an active rodent infestation, severe drainage problems or filthy conditions - officers will act to close a business down immediately until it has rectified the problems.

The restaurant, where meals cost roughly £50 per head, serves up 28 day aged 'native beef' steaks (file pic)

'This usually only takes a few days to allow the business to bring in proper systems and carry out necessary treatment and repairs.

'On average, we will take emergency action on about 40 food businesses - from between 3,000 and 4,000 inspections - each year.

'Therefore a very small proportion of serious problems are found in food businesses and the public can be assured these are dealt with quickly.'

The news comes just a week after it was revealed Jamie Oliver's upmarket butcher Barbecoa, in the City of London, was forced to close after failing a health inspection.

On that occasion food inspectors found mouse droppings, out of date wagyu steak and mouldy cow carcasses.

Barbecoa, next to St Paul's Cathedral in the City of London, shut down for 24 hours when officers gave it the worst possible hygiene rating - branding it 'hazardous'.

Mould was found growing on carcasses in the basement chillers and expensive meats including wagyu beef, oxtail, onglet, and Spanish-style pork called lomo de cana.

Dirty slicers and vacuum packers were also found, as well as a 'heavy presence' of mouse droppings.

Old chicken which had been de-boned and vacuum packed was found to be relabelled with a later use-by date.
