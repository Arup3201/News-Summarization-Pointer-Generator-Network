Private Eye editor Ian Hislop said the victims of the Charlie Hebdo shooting had 'paid a very high price for exercising their comic liberty'.

The satirical magazine targeted by three masked gunmen is widely seen as France's answer to Private Eye and prides itself on a mixture of tongue-in-cheek reporting and investigative journalism. 

At least 12 people died in the attack, believed to include editorial staff members Jean Cabu, Stephane 'Charb' Charbonnier, Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac and Bernard Maris.

Private Eye editor Ian Hislop said the victims of the Charlie Hebdo shooting had 'paid a very high price for exercising their comic liberty'

Gunmen brandishing Kalashnikovs burst into the Charlie Hebdo headquarters, opening fire on staff after seeking out journalists by name.

Those executed included four of the most famous cartoonists in France – men who had regularly satirised Islam and the Prophet Mohammed – including the newspaper's editor-in-chief, Stephane Charbonnier.

In a statement, journalist and writer Mr Hislop said: 'I am appalled and shocked by this horrific attack - a murderous attack on free speech in the heart of Europe.

'I offer my condolences to the families and friends of those killed - the cartoonists, journalists and those who were trying to protect them.

'They paid a very high price for exercising their comic liberty.'

He added: 'Very little seems funny today.' 

The editor-in-chief of British satire website The Daily Mash has also spoken of his shock at the Charlie Hebdo terror attack.

Neil Rafferty said he and the website's team of writers felt the murderous attack was 'beyond belief'.

He said that his site, which has already expressed solidarity with the French magazine on Twitter and Facebook, was planning its own response.

The former news journalist said: 'We are a little bit shocked. I think me and the writers think it is beyond belief really.

'You think if it is possible that these sorts of extremists would turn their guns on writers and satirists. It seems such an extreme possibility that when it happens it shocks you to the core.'

The massacre this morning was France's deadliest terror attack in at least two decades.

Witnesses said the suspect Al Qaeda killers were heard to shout 'the Prophet has been avenged' and 'Allahu akbar!' as they stalked the building.

Horrific footage also emerged showing an injured police officer slumped on the pavement outside the office as two of the gunmen approach. 

Charlie Hebdo's editor-in-chief, Gerard Biard, who was in London at the time of the attack, said: 'I don't understand how people can attack a newspaper with heavy weapons. A newspaper is not a weapon of war.'

Twitter users have begun using the #JeSuisCharlie hashtag in a show of solidarity with the publication. 

Magazine Charlie Hebdo has taken several highly provocative swipes at Islam.

The magazine once named Prophet Mohammed as its guest editor, published cartoons of the holy figure in the nude, and once renamed itself Sharia Hebdo with the cover slogan '100 lashes if you don't die of laughter'.

The controversy began in 2006 when the publication reprinted now-infamous cartoons of Prophet Mohammed by Danish artist Kurt Westergaard.

When the images originally appeared they lead to days of protests across the Middle East and in Western cities. The decision to reprint the images landed the then-editor in court under anti-terror laws, though he was later acquitted.

British tourists in Paris have been warned to take 'extra care' in the wake of the terrorist gun attack in the French capital which left 12 people dead.

The Foreign Office said those in the French capital should be more vigilant because of the 'high threat from terrorism' in the country.

It is understood he will order a meeting of Cobra to be held tomorrow. Scotland Yard is in discussions with the government about the public response expected later.

Whitehall sources expect police, security services and senior politicians including the Home Secretary Theresa May to hold talks to discuss Britain's response to the attack.

Britain's terror threat level is currently set at 'severe' but the question of increasing to 'critical', the highest state of alert, is likely to be discussed.

It was last raised to critical in 2007 in the wake of terror attacks in London and Glasgow, and indicates an extremely high level of threat. 

The Foreign Office  updated its travel advice to state: 'If you're in Paris or the Ile de France area, take extra care and follow the security advice issued by the French authorities.

'There is a high threat from terrorism. Attacks could be indiscriminate. Due to ongoing threats to France by Islamist groups, and recent French military intervention against ISIL, the French government has warned the public to be especially vigilant and has reinforced its own domestic and overseas security measures.

'Previous incidents attributed to Islamist extremists have included the shooting of 3 soldiers and 4 civilians in Toulouse, and a knife attack on a soldier near Paris.'

The Hebdo offices were burned to the ground in 2011 when attackers used Molotov cocktails to start a blaze early in the morning of November 2.

There was nobody in the building at the time, and the target was instead thought to be the magazine's computer system, which was completely destroyed.

Riot police were forced to stand guard outside the building for days following the attack, as the editors took a defiant stance, choosing to reprint the cartoon images multiple times.

In 2012 they again printed cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed as a deliberately provocative gesture while violent protests were taking place across the Middle East.

The following year the magazine's office again had to be surrounded by riot officers after they published a cartoon booklet depicting the Prohpet naked as a baby and being pushed in a wheelchair.

On the final page of the booklet there was a note from the editor, Stephane Charbonnier, saying the images were 'halal' because Muslims had worked on them, and that they were factually accurate as they had been derived from descriptions in the Koran. 

Hebdo's current office building has no notices on the door to prevent a repeat of the attacks that have occurred in the past.

In an interview with De Volkskrant in January 2013, Mr Charbonnier revealed he had been placed under constant police protection for four months after one of the cartoon issues was published.

He shrugged off criticism that he was only publishing the images to gain notoriety for Hebdo, and insisted that he was instead defending the right to free speech.

Mr Charbonnier pointed out that the magazine had poked fun at feminism, nuclear energy and homeland security, but the Islam issues always attracted the most publicity. 

Prime Minister David Cameron said Britain stands 'united with the French people' in opposition to terrorists and defending free speech and democracy.

He told MPs: 'While details are still unclear I know that this house and this country stands united with the French people in our opposition to all forms of terrorism and we stand squarely for free speech and democracy.

'These people will never take us off those values.'

In a statement the Queen said: 'Prince Philip and I send our sincere condolences to the families of those who have been killed and to those who have been injured in the attack in Paris this moming.

'We send our thoughts and prayers to all those who have been affected.'

Mr Cameron, who is to be briefed by security services tonight, will call French President Francois Hollande  to offer British condolences and solidarity.

It is understood he will order a meeting of Cobra to be held tomorrow. Scotland Yard is in discussions with the government about the public response expected later.

Whitehall sources expect police, security services and senior politicians including the Home Secretary Theresa May to hold talks to discuss Britain's response to the attack.

Britain's terror threat level is currently set at 'severe' but the question of increasing to 'critical', the highest state of alert, is likely to be discussed.

Four of France's most revered cartoonists - Stephane Charbonnier, Georges Wolinski, Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac and Jean Cabut - were among 12 people executed by masked gunmen in Paris at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.

Two masked men brandishing Kalashnikovs burst into the magazine's headquarters this morning, opening fire on staff.

Police officers were involved in a gunfight with the men, who escaped in a hijacked car, speeding away towards east Paris and remain on the loose, along with a third armed man.

Charbonnier, 47, known by his pen name Charb, was the editor of the weekly magazine.

Cabut, also called Cabu, its lead cartoonist and Wolinski an 80-year-old satirist who had been drawing cartoons since the 1960s.

There are reports that the gunmen asked for the cartoonists by name before shooting them dead. 

Radio France chief executive Mathieu Gilet announced on Twitter that a contributor, Bernard Maris, was another of the victims
