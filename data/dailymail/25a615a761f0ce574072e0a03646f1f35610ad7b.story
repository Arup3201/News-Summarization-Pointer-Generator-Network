Former Loose Women star Lisa Maxwell has angered locals by putting up a wedding gazebo at her home without planning permission.

The chat show panelist put up the structure to provide a backdrop for her nuptials - which were held at her home in Edge, Gloucestershire, on Saturday.

The television star's new husband Paul Jessup first submitted a planning application to Painswick Parish Council to build the gazebo in April this year.

Former Loose Women star Lisa Maxwell has angered her neighbours after erecting a wooden gazebo near to her home (grounds pictured) for her wedding. The television star tied with knot with Paul Jessup on Saturday

The television star tweeted after the event that some neighbours had attended the nuptials  - and that 'only a few had complained' about the work

He also submitted a request for the couple to build a new parking area and track near to their home - work for which is believed to be currently underway.

The application was then revised by Mr Jessup on May 29th.

However, the local council said permission was yet to be granted for the work - and that a reply was not expected until August.

Officers added they object to the plan at the Grade II-listed marital home, as: 'It is out of keeping as there are concerns regarding parking and access onto the highway.'

Today, outraged neighbours Giles and Polly Colin said: 'The destruction of an established garden and agricultural land has continued without planning permission.

'It is an eyesore that is clearly visible over an historic wall.'

Painswick
 Valleys Conservation Society has also objected to the plan saying it is
 'harmful to the character of the area of outstanding natural beauty.'

If
 Stroud District Council refuses permission to the happy couple, then 
they could be forced to remove the gazebo and parking area.

A
 spokesman for the council said: 'Obviously with any planning 
application it is always best to wait until permission is granted before
 you proceed just in case it is not approved.'

Tweeting after the party, the new bride said: 'A lot of my neighbours were at the wedding.

Only a couple of people have complained.'

Workmen put up a marquee on the grounds last week. Mr Jessop applied for planning permission for the wooden structure, as well as a track and a parking area, in April - but the council is yet to approve the plans

Celebrity guests also took to Twitter to congratulated the newlyweds.

Eastenders
 actor Shane Richie said: 'Had the incredible honour of giving away the 
most beautiful friend anyone can wish to have @thelisamaxwell so proud.'

Carol Vorderman added: 'Had a wonderful last few days... @thelisamaxwell wedding was amazing on Saturday.'

MailOnline has contacted representatives of Lisa Maxwell for comment.
