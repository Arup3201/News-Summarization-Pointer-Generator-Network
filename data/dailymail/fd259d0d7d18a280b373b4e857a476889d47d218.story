We all know people who seem to have an endless list of lovers, but never want to settle with just one, plus there's no shortage of stars who seem to have a different partner very month.

Taylor Swift's list of supposed suitors, for example still impressively long for a 24-year old (Harry Styles, Jake Gyllenhaal, Joe Jonas, Taylor Lautner, John Mayer, Connor Kennedy…)

Which begs the question, are people like Taylor simply choosing wisely and carefully - or being picky? As a multi-millionaire, supermodelesque pop powerhouse, she has every right to be.

Taylor Swift, seen here with ex-boyfriend Harry Styles, has a long list of past suitors for a 24-year-old, Tracey says that this could suggest that she is too picky

But if you're ditching partners for tiny reasons like, I don't know, their left toenail's not quite straight, being too picky can mean you've got zero chance of ever finding someone.

As much as I hate to say this, it's a bit of a female thing.

Ask a man what he's looking for in a woman and he'll say something like, 'Big knockers.'

Ask a woman and she'll start counting off on her fingers. 'Well, he's got to be taller than me. And have great teeth, I can't stand guys with bad teeth. I could never date a guy who had those awful patches of hair on his fingers – and he's got to be blonde and make me laugh and . . .'

Psychologists say it's because women expect more from relationships than men do. We don't just want a boyfriend, we want a lover, friend, playmate, career adviser, confidante, handyman, accountant, masseur, dishwasher and shrink. And that's an awful lot of skills to find in one person.

Tracey says that holding out for Mr. Right can mean that you dismiss people too quickly, she says you should always go on three dates before ruling someone out

Most of us drop a few (hundred) things off our wish lists when it becomes painfully clear we'd need to date a football team to fulfil all of them – but not all women are willing to let go.

Their wants remain etched in stone and they cling stubbornly to the belief that Mr Perfect is out there, they just haven't met him yet.

Is this you?

Count up the number of dates you've been asked out on in the last year. How many did you accept?

A coffee with one guy out of seven?

If this is you, I have a question: if you don't go out with very many men, how have you got the experience to know what sort of guy really would suit you?

Tracey says try not to be put off by small habits that may irritate you and focus on the bigger picture

Saving yourself for Mr or Ms Perfect isn't just boring, it's actually stopping you meeting them.

Most of us pick up ­relationship skills from every relationship we have, so the more people you date, the better at relationships you are.

Plus, you need to be out there.

True, your perfect match is going to turn up when you least expect it, in the least likely place, looking not at all like you expected. But they're not going to come knocking on your front door (though I do know a girl who ended up marrying the man who came to fix her ceiling fan – true story!).

You're being too picky if...

Dates accuse you of asking too many questions, too early

It's a date, not a job interview, and they're well aware you're fishing.

Asking where they went to school is fine. Asking what their father does for a living and what sort of car they drive isn't.

You've only ever seen your perfect partner on a movie screen

The chance of meeting Bradley Cooper is slim. The chances of him falling in love with you if you do are pathetically slim.

Tracey says that a great way of recognising whether or not you're too picky is by gauging your friends reaction to your dream man

Your friends roll about in hysterical laughter when you tell them the type of person you're hanging out for

Tell them your five 'must have's' and see if they can keep a straight face. If they can't, you're being unrealistic (or, dare I say it, punching above your weight?)

Your friend, who rates similarly on the attractiveness scale, goes out on ten dates to your one

The point here is rather obvious, don't you think?

You discount people after the first date

Give them at least three before you make up your mind. First impressions are often wrong.

You won't go out with someone because they're not your type physically

A wit as sharp as a razor blade, the ability to really listen to you, make you laugh your pants off – all can change your perception of how someone looks if you give them a chance.

You refuse dates because of where someone lives, the car they drive, their salary or their clothes

You're not just being picky, you're a snob. Does the word superficial ring a bell?

When it's sensible to be a fusspot

If you were abused

You may subconsciously pick ­potential abusers. It's wise to be cautious and screen new partners.

If you've just come out of a long-term relationship and are feeling raw and vulnerable

Why cause yourself more pain by diving into another bad relationship?

If you can't say no to anyone

You've been on 25 dates in the last two weeks and didn't really like or fancy any of them? Reverse all the suggestions I've made: you need to be more choosy, not less!
