Royal piano tuner Gordon Bell has admitted he can't play the instrument

He is one of the country's top piano tuners and counts the Queen herself among his customers.

So it may come as a surprise that Gordon Bell can't actually play the instrument.

The 39-year-old, who has been tuning pianos since he was 16, is one of only three piano experts with a Royal Warrant, which he was awarded in 2008.

'I can't play the piano. It's an advantage to be able to play, but not essential,' Mr Bell admitted.

The father of two, from Aberdeen, visits Balmoral regularly. He said he once went to get some tools from his van and saw the Queen and Prince Philip right next to it – while his pregnant wife sat oblivious inside.

He also revealed the strangest place he's tuned a piano was in a jail's recreation room. 'Prisoners were mopping the floors around me. No one spoke.' 

Mr Bell was always interested in music as a youngster, but confesses he was not good enough to be a performer.

His mother noticed the three-year Higher National Diploma course in strings, keyboard and instrument technology at Edinburgh's Stevenson College and he signed up.

After graduating, he went on to launch his own prestige business in Aberdeen's Rosemount Viaduct in 2003 and landed the Royal Warrant five years later, aged 32.

He said: 'The staff at Balmoral called Aberdeen's Music Hall to find out who tuned their pianos and they recommended me.'

His first visit to the Royal residence was nerve-racking, but they invited him back and he was later awarded the 'by Royal Appointment' tag.

'Being a piano tuner has its moments,' he said. 'When my wife Lisa was pregnant she decided to come with me to Balmoral and joked with her friends that she was going to see the Queen, never thinking she actually would.

'I was inside the castle and came out to get some tools from the van when I noticed Her Majesty and Prince Philip with the corgis standing right beside it.

'They were chatting to their house keeper and my wife was inside the van reading her magazine. She didn't even look up or notice they were there.'

He says he is one of a dying breed, with few young people signing up for the last of the training courses in the trade.

Meanwhile, he says demand for 'acoustic' pianos - those that are not digital - is buoyant.

'The fact that the piano industry survives in this day and age is remarkable,' admits Mr Bell. 

'The piano is 300 years old, it has seen off X-Boxes and 3D TVs. If anything, the digital era has helped. People who learn on electric pianos often want to move up to the real thing.'

He has hit the right note where business is concerned. He and his buddies in the trade - Elgin-based Moray Firth Pianos and Scotland's oldest piano specialists, Allan Makin and Sons in Edinburgh - have never been busier in the tuning and remodelling stakes. They are also kept on their toes with sales.

'I can't play the piano,' the father of two said. 'It's an advantage to be able to play, but not essential'

The Makins have Susan Boyle for a client. And Glyn Morris at Moray Firth Pianos (which specialises in hire) has had a string of star customers including Jools Holland. Glyn provided pianos for the weddings of Take That singer Mark Owen and Madonna.

He said: 'The most treasured moments I brought away from Madonna's wedding were meeting Sting and seeing Madonna teaching Gwyneth Paltrow the dance move from her then latest single, Don't tell me' - only four feet away from where I was installing and tuning the piano.'

Mr Bell, who was educated at the Biggar Academy, says he fell foul of Julian Lloyd Webber during one of many tuning sessions for the stars of stage and screen.

'I was once working on the piano accompanying Julian Lloyd Webber. As I went to move my tool case, he swore at me and told me to watch his cello.'
