Charged: 18-year-old Amed Pelle has admitted inciting friends to riot via Facebook

A teenager who incited his 2,000 Facebook friends to riot was inspired by a violent cult film about gangs ruling the streets, a court heard yesterday.

At one point he encouraged the killing of a million police officers.

Amed Pelle, 18, sent three messages on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday following the outbreak of violence in his home city of Nottingham.

The first two read: ‘Nottz Riot whose
 onit?’ and ‘Kill one black youth, we kill a million Fedz [police], riot
 til we own cities’.

It
 is believed the second message was a reference to Mark Duggan, whose 
death in Tottenham last week sparked the original trouble.

In
 his third message, Pelle asked if friends wanted goods from a fashion 
shop. He wrote: ‘Rioting 2nyt anyone want anything from Flannels?’ The 
store, in the city centre, had its windows smashed hours later.

Unemployed Pelle pleaded guilty at Nottingham magistrates’ court to a breach of section 44 of the Serious Crime Act 2007. He was remanded in custody for sentencing at the city’s crown court.

Prosecutor John Wallis said Pelle told police that he had watched a film called Shank, in which gangs take over London, and that he ‘wanted the same to happen here’.

The 2010 film depicted an apocalyptic future capital where gangs of youths rule the streets and carry out looting and wanton violence.

Pelle, who is from Cuba, was arrested
 after police officers spotted the messages while monitoring social 
networking sites during the trouble in the city.

Initially he claimed they were a joke, but his sinister intentions began to emerge during police interviews.

Mr
 Wallis told the court that Pelle, of Old Basford, admitted he ‘wanted 
to see police stations damaged’, adding: ‘He didn’t want to get involved
 in violence himself but wanted to encourage others to do so.

‘He
 said he wanted police officers hurt, especially after the shooting [of 
Mark Duggan] in London, because they always seem to pick on black 
youths.

‘He wanted the riots to continue as a demonstration of black youth against the authorities and police.’

The hearing was told Pelle admitted that
 among his 2,000 contacts were ‘old, violent, nasty gang friends’ from 
the tough inner-city Radford district where he used to live.

Damage: The violence in Nottingham was largely directed towards the police, such as this destroyed patrol car

Mr Wallis said Pelle claimed his father was a distant cousin of Mr Duggan’s uncle.

Annelli Pritchard, defending, said: ‘He is 18 and, in my submission, somewhat naive. He did not realise the far-reaching consequences of putting these comments on Facebook.

‘He now fully appreciates the seriousness of the situation.’ Applying for bail, Miss Pritchard said Pelle, who has no previous convictions, had not personally participated in any rioting and his involvement was restricted to the Facebook messages.

However, magistrates’ chairman Janet Ellis turned down the request, saying: ‘We consider the offence of encouraging violent disorder so serious that we feel our sentencing powers are insufficient for this matter to be dealt with in this court.

‘We feel there are substantial grounds, because of the nature and seriousness of the offence at a time of major unrest throughout the country, that there is a risk you could commit further offences.’

Pelle, who wore a white T-shirt and navy jogging bottoms, was handcuffed and led from the dock.

Last night, neighbours spoke of their shock over his conviction. They said he comes from a religious family and was seen most Sundays going to church in a suit and carrying a Bible.

One said: ‘He’s regarded as a good lad. He has a twin brother and an older brother and they are always laughing and joking.

‘I’m not aware of Amed causing any trouble. The family have lived here for a couple of years - there’s a mother living there, but I’m not sure about a father.

‘The family seem to go to church most Sundays. You see them walking there on a Sunday morning. The boys wear suits and they are carrying Bibles.

‘Their mother will be really hit hard by this. She’s the type of mum who tries to keep a good family.’
