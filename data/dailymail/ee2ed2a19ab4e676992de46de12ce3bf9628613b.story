Happy: An inquest heard Oliver King, 16, became introverted before taking his own life

A sixth-former who became introverted and withdrawn when he met his first girlfriend was found hanged after spending his final three hours searching for death metal songs on YouTube, an inquest heard.

Oliver King, 16, left no suicide note and had never received any medical help for depression or mental illness.

However, he texted a friend weeks before his death saying 'I imagine killing myself every day'. Police also found deleted images on his iPod which included the words: 'I’m sorry I want to give up. I’m sorry I want to die. I’m 
sorry I want to kill myself.'

A coroner ruled he had been going through 'some dark periods' generally and was 'trapped with nobody to turn to for objective advice'.

Oliver's parents, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, told the inquest he turned from an outgoing schoolboy into an introvert after beginning his first serious relationship.

The teenager began spending little time 
at home, lost weight and fell behind with his A-level studies. He had 
coursework deadlines the day after he died in February last year and relations with his parents became strained.

A year before he died, he began his first serious relationship and began wearing dark clothes, long hair and make-up and listening to a new range of bands, his parents said.

The inquest heard Oliver spent three hours on the night he died viewing songs including The Body of 
Death of the Man With The Body of Death by Pinkly Smooth, before taking 
his own life while his mother was out of the house.

After the hearing his father Adrian 
King, 43, a management and IT consultant, said: 'I think the music did 
contribute to his state of mind. He was hanging out with the wrong crowd
 and I believe this lifestyle was more to blame than anything else.

'He had changed his clothes, his music, his address and his face. He was manipulated and felt isolated.

'Anyone who had met Oliver a year before his death would not have recognised him a year later.

'A year before he was a regular 15-year-old. He had friends, was happy with his life, had a good relationship with his parents, was gifted at art and progressing well at school.'

But Oliver's girlfriend denied the music was 'dark', as the coroner asked, and instead pointed to the fact the schoolboy 'did not feel comfortable at home' and had been stressed with coursework. Another school friend said he had been teased over his new look.

Oliver was found hanging by his mother Diane King, whose attempts to revive him failed and he died in Rotherham Hospital.

She told the inquest Oliver, who lived
 with his father after the couple divorced, preferred to be at his 
girlfriend’s house and stayed out most days and 
evenings as well as studying.

'He was very secretive and wouldn’t tell me where he was or where he was going,' said Mrs King.

Two weeks before his death he moved back in with his mother, the inquest heard.

The inquest heard Oliver’s 
relationship may have hit a 'rocky patch' and his girlfriend made 20 
attempts to contact him in a short space of time just before he was 
found.

A text from Oliver to her read: 'Please, please stay strong you are not leaving.'

His iPod contained deleted images with 
the words 'everything will be OK in the end, if it’s not OK its the 
end.' Another said: 'I have driven myself to the edge. I can't take it 
any more.'

His girlfriend, whom the coroner asked not to be named, arrived at the house with another boy after Oliver had been found.

Mrs
 King told the inquest: 'She said: "Is it Oliver? Is he dead?" She didn’t seem overly
 upset. I thought had they split up and is he the new boyfriend.'

Det Con Ian Hampshire, who 
investigated Oliver’s death, said a fellow pupil told him: 'Oliver felt 
trapped and always had to do what his girlfriend wanted to do.'

And Mr King told the inquest he and his 
ex-wife had clashed with the girl’s parents over the amount of time 
Oliver was spending at their house.

But
 the girl told the inquest Oliver had become 'very stressed' with his 
coursework, especially ICT, and he had project deadlines the day after 
his death.

She said it was 
his choice to wear eyeliner but he had not changed his clothes since 
meeting her. They shared the same interest in music, including the bands Avenged Sevenfold and Black Veil Brides, but he was not 
associated with any particular group.

Asked by the coroner if it was 'dark' music she replied: 'Not from my perspective. I don’t see it as dark music.'

She added he spent a lot of time with her 
because he 'did not feel comfortable' at home, and denied telling him 
their relationship was over.

Another schoolfriend said Oliver was 'kind and 
full of joy' before he returned to school in the September term.

'He had
 dramatically lost weight and wore eyeliner,' he told the inquest. 'He was aware there was some
 name-calling and ill-feeling from some of the other pupils.'

The sixth-former had been struggling 
with his schoolwork but improved after a clear-the-air meeting at school, his head of sixth form Patrick Buttrell told the inquest.

Mr Buttrell added there was no official dress code for sixth formers but he had asked Oliver to tone down his make-up.

'It was a light-hearted conversation, he gave me a bit of a smile and said he knew it was over the top,' said Mr Buttrell.

The teenager’s death triggered an investigation involving childrens’ services, public health and police in Rotherham.

Deputy Rotherham coroner Fred Curtis said Oliver had 'loving and caring' parents and his new relationship had come at the expense of family and friends.

'He was trapped with nobody to turn to for objective advice,' said Mr Curtis.

He was 'paranoid' over his relationship with his girlfriend which 'may have reached a rocky patch' in his mind and he was troubled by his schoolwork.

The Coroner added: 'He had been through some dark periods and that evening it culminated in a decision, in my view, to take his own life.'
