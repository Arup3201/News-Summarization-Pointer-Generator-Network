A rare 109-year-old French steam-powered car bought by a farmer for £450 is set to fetch around £350,000 when it goes on sale.

The Gardner-Serpollet 18HP Type L Phaeton Steamer was built in 1905 and still boasts its early Norwich number plate. 

It was bought in 1957 by George Milligen, of Stalham in Norfolk, for £450 from Suffolk harpsichord maker and steam car enthusiast, Alec Hodsdon.

But when it goes up for auction at Bonhams at the end of this month, the Gardner-Serpollet is expected to go for between £340,000 and £360,000. 

Built in 1905, the vintage car is expected to go for between £340,000 and £360,000 at Bonhams on October 31

The average weekly wage at the time was £12 and Mr Milligen, then in his late 40s, paid around £9,467 for the car in today's money.  

But the vintage vehicle's value has since rocketed and it went for £238,000 at Bonhams in April 2009. 

A Bonhams spokesman said Mr Milligen, who died in 2004, had realised it was the car, not the horse, that was the future in rural East Anglia.

He said: 'The late George Milligen was no ordinary Norfolk farmer.

'Born into a privileged family, his father being a successful industrialist, George's decision to embark on a farming career was a bold one and from the outset he saw the advantages of mechanised farming at a time when the horse was still a most frequent sight on Norfolk farms.

'This foresight undoubtedly contributed to George's success in his farming career and this in turn enabled him to indulge his passion for all things mechanical, provided that they intrigued his inquisitive mind.

The 1905 Gardner-Serpollet 18hp Type L Phaeton Steamer was voted the historically most important car at the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run in 2010

'Around his East Ruston Manor Farm, at Stalham, the mildly eccentric Milligen was a familiar sight in any one of his amazing collection of early motor cars, whether at high speed at the wheel of his 1929 supercharged Mercedes-Benz SSK, tootling along in his 1909 AX Renault, or more spectacularly keeping the pressure up on one of his steam vehicles.'

Nearly 60 years after Mr Milligen bought the Steamer, it's still going strong and is due to compete in the iconic London to Brighton Veteran Car Run on November 2.

It was also voted the historically most important car in the event four years ago.

Frenchman Léon Serpollet had invented and perfected the multi-tube flash boiler in 1888 - which made steam a more practical source of power for a car. 

He then began building steam automobiles under his own name in Paris from 1897.

Serpollet joined forces with wealthy American industrialist Frank Gardner, who built his own petrol-engined cars between 1898 and 1900, and Gardner-Serpollet spearheaded steam car production in Europe from 1900 until 1907.

In the 1902 Paris to Vienna race in, all five of the Serpollet cars entered finished the 615 mile race and in that same year Serpollet took the World Land Speed Record at just over 75mph. 

High quality, expert engineering, and excellent performances in competition put Gardner-Serpollet's cars at the top of the market. 

In 1904, the 18HP Type L model was introduced, which uses a rear-mounted boiler and a front-mounted straight-four engine, and was more in line with the current conventions of cars.

Only seven Gardner-Serpollet steam cars are believed to exist. Milligen's Gardner-Serpollet is the only shaft-driven Serpollet left in existence and one of only two Type Ls in the world.
