The Obama administration believes there is a new leaker of compromising national security secrets who could potentially compound the embarrassment caused by NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

The federal government has come to this conclusion after a new story was published on Tuesday morning by The Intercept, the site launched by Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who first brought the Snowden leaks to public attention.

According to CNN, the proof lies in documents obtained for the article about US government surveillance of suspected terrorists which is dated from August 2013 - months after Snowden escaped first to Hong Kong and then to Russia to escape spying charges.

Indeed, Rio-based Greenwald, who left the Guardian last year to launch The Intercept with the backing of eBay founder, billionaire, Pierre Omidyar, has fanned the flames by suggesting there is indeed another leaker.

The nightmare news for the Obama administration comes as a report in The Intercept highlights the one million names collected on the database called the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment (TIDE).

It claims that as part of this data, there is one watchlist called the Terrorist Screening Database which contains 680,000 names, of which only a fraction are Americans.

However, it also claims that 40 percent of those on the list have no affiliation at all to terrorist groups.

In
 addition, the list has basically doubled since the underwear bomber 
plot to destroy a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day in 2009.

Concern: President Barack Obama and his administration have become convinced there is a second source according to CNN

The justification for this is that the would-be bomber, Umar Farouk Abdulmuttalab was not on any watchlists at the time that could have had a chance of preventing the attack.

A spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined any comment on the CNN report on Tuesday.

In addition to The Intercept's report, two recent article in the German press have reported on US national security and spying issues without citing Snowden - adding to the theory that the notorious whistleblower is not the only leak.

'That's particularly notable given that virtually every other article using Snowden documents - including der Spiegel - specifically identified him as the source,' Greenwald said in an email to The Hill last month.
