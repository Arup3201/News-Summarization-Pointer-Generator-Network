A 90-year-old war hero, who risked life and limb for his country during World War Two, was slapped with a £70 parking fine as he attended a Remembrance Day service - because his blue badge was upside down.

Disabled George Roberts, who served as a gunner and a driver transporting artillery across Africa, has hit out at jobsworth traffic wardens who gave him the ticket while he paid his respects to fallen comrades in Shrewsbury, Shropshire.

The wheelchair-bound veteran was driven to the service at St Chad's Church by his son Michael, 43, who parked in a nearby disabled bay.

But when Mr Roberts, who has also survived a stroke and four heart bypass operations, and Michael returned to the car after the emotional service, they were shocked to find a parking ticket on the windscreen.

Attempts to reason with a traffic warden fell on deaf ears as the pair were told they would have to contact the local council.

The warden even echoed the chilling excuse of some of Hitler's men when he claimed he had issued the ticket because he was 'following orders'.

Mr Roberts served in the Royal Artillery Regiment in World War Two and attends the Remembrance Day procession and service every year.

Earlier this year he was forced to stop driving but still qualifies for a blue disabled badge because son Michael is his dedicated carer and driver.

George, who has four grown-up children, 13 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren, said: 'I was struggling to get out of my car and I must have disturbed my blue badge.

'Many millions of men never came back from the war, and I went through it all without a bullet - only to get shot by this.

'I’ve been driving for more than 70 years and had never received a parking ticket. It was hilarious, my son was driving me and my granddaughter and her fiance were there.

'I laughed but my family chased the warden and he wouldn’t do anything.

'Incredibly, he muttered something about "just following orders" which I found incredibly insensitive considering the service we had just attended.

'I was in the war for five years and drove through Africa for three of those. I had to give up driving at the beginning of this year.'

The pensioner witnessed dozens of his comrades killed during the bloody Allied invasion of north Africa in 1942.

After the war George married his wartime sweetheart Edith who worked in canteens during the war in Shrewsbury.

She died in 2001 aged 81.

His grand-daughter Kerrieanne McMullen, 29, hit out at the traffic wardens - branding them 'disgraceful.'

She fumed: 'The blue badge was displayed but the wrong way around so you couldn’t see the expiry date.

'To get a ticket on Armistice Day was disgraceful.'

Red-faced bosses at Shropshire Council today apologised to George, and promised to cancel the ticket.
