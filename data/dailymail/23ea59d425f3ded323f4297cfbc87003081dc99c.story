It is known as the happiest country in the world.

And now Bhutan has released some spectacular images showing everyday life in the remote kingdom, including a snap of young Buddhist monks taken by the king himself.

The stunning photos offer a glimpse of Bhutan that many will never see - a country where success is measured by happiness instead of GDP - and its gross national happiness (GNH) takes precedent over material wealth and riches.

It is an unusual idea, first proposed by the former king Jigme Singye Wangchuck in 1972, around the time this remote kingdom high in the Himalayas tentatively opened its doors to tourism.

Since then, the country has gained almost mythical status as an under-the-radar Shangri-La, where western visitors can explore a different way of life. 

The country has always drawn curious travellers thanks to its majestic untouched Himalayan scenery. But this week, it's expecting an unprecedented influx of visitors, as it holds its first ever International Festival, a 10-day celebration of arts and culture, starting on February 14.

To coincide with the 5th King’s  35th birthday celebration and Losar, the Buddhist New Year, the festival will see eighty artists and performers, including Indian pop star, Lucky Ali and Mercury nominated UK indie folk artist, Nick Mulvey collaborating with the best from Bhutan.

Ahead of the spectacular festival, Bhutan has released the set of images offering a glimpse into life in 'the happiest country in the world' including one taken by King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck, showing young Buddhist monks against the spectacular backdrop of the King's Palace.

During the festivities, traditional masked  dancers will perform alongside contemporary acts from around the world, and visitors can attend talks on the latest theories about happiness.

Flights to Bhutan cost around £900 return from UK/Europe, or $1500 from the USA.

The event also comprises the Bhutan International Marathon and immersive traditional cooking demonstrations from the country's best chefs.

Until recently, Bhutan has been isolated due to geographical location, allowing it to retain its unique culture and heritage.

Bhutan is known for its natural scenic and cultural highlights and its welcoming people. It was the first country in the world to write environmental protection into its constitution, with a mandate for 60 per cent of country to be covered by forest.

Virginia Galloway, Festival Co-Director tells Mail Online Travel: 'The aim is to position Bhutan International Festival as a unique, must-attend, world class festival that serves not only the artistic community but has a positive ripple effect on the local economy.

'The concept is to bring together various artistic disciplines with an emphasis on collaboration, which will hopefully inspire new works of art and new ways of working.'

'Most festivals in Bhutan and around the globe are about highlighting the works of individual artists. 

'We decided to take a different approach by not only highlighting individuals, but also encouraging and fostering artistic collaborations between participating artists.'
