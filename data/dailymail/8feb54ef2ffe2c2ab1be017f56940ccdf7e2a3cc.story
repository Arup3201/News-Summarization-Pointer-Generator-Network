David Cameron today hit back at Lib Dem calls for drugs to be decriminalised – claiming it would encourage children to get hooked.

The Prime Minister said he did not want to send a message to youngsters than taking drugs was okay. He said: ‘Frankly, it isn’t.’

It comes after the Lib Dems jumped on a landmark Home Office report which claimed punishing substance abuse had no impact on the number of people getting addicted. MPs, also backed a motion today calling for the Government to overhaul Britain’s ‘failing’ drug laws.

David Cameron held a PM Direct at an O2 Call Centre in Runcorn, Cheshire, today - in which he rejected calls for drugs to be decriminalised

But the Prime Minister, speaking at an O2 call centre in Preston Brook, Cheshire, said the Government’s drugs policies were working.

He said: ‘What we are doing is working. I don't believe in decriminalising drugs that are illegal today.

‘I'm a parent with three children - I don't want to send out a message that somehow taking these drugs is OK and safe because, frankly, it isn't.’

Mr Cameron added: ‘And frankly I think one of the biggest problems we have got right now is the problem of so-called legal highs, drugs are being sold openly which can have real dangers, for particularly young people and I want to see us have tougher powers so that we ban these legal highs, take them off the high streets and protect more of our young people.’ 

But the Lib Dems said treating drug addicts as criminals was ‘nonsensical’ and did nothing to cut down abuse.

Mr Clegg said giving drug addicts criminal records was 'helping the real criminals' - the dealers. 

Home Office minister Norman Baker said a landmark new report published by the Home Office showed tough anti drug laws did not work and need to be scrapped. 

He said taking drugs should be decriminalised like in Portugal where even heroin and cocaine are not banned. 

It comes after a Home Office report found that decriminalising deadly narcotics would not lead to more Britons taking them – and that tough anti-drugs laws do not work.

The report was led by Norman Baker (pictured), a Liberal Democrat home office minister, and looked at how other countries tackle drug use - it concluded that tough anti-drugs law do not work 

The 55-page report on how other countries tackle drug use – spearheaded by Mr Baker – was released along with another Home Office report on how to deal with dangerous ‘legal highs’ being sold on the High Street.

Speaking this morning Mr Baker said: ‘There is no correlation between the toughness of a country's penalty regime and the amount of drug use in that country.’

He added: ‘We’ve had what I would call mindless rhetoric over the last forty years which has tended to say there's only one solution and anyone who offers any alternative must by definition be "soft on drugs".'

Mr Baker said the Government study showed 'there's no correlation between the toughness of a particular government's response to drugs in terms of the penalties applicable and the level of drug use in that country'.

He said: ‘It also shows for example that in Portugal, where the question of drugs is treated as a health matter rather than a criminal one, that's been effective both at getting people off drugs and therefore reducing drug use. So I think we do have to look at the evidence.

‘Locking somebody up in prison for a matter of weeks because they happen to possess a Class B or a Class C drug is a nonsensical approach. It doesn't change their attitude.’ 

Earlier this month Mr Baker accused No10 of sitting on the reports since July and blamed the Conservatives for blocking their release for ‘political reasons’. The report on drug use abroad involved Liberal Democrat ministers embarking on a £40,000 international drug law fact-finding mission.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today accused the Tories of being 'frightened' of decriminalising drugs

It has sparked a row within the Coalition as the Tories reject its findings and vow ‘never’ to decriminalise drugs – while the Liberal Democrats say drug addicts should ‘be helped to recover rather than put behind bars’.

The report said: ‘It is not clear that decriminalisation has an impact on levels of drug use. Looking across different countries, there is no apparent correlation between the “toughness” of a country’s approach and the prevalence of adult drug use.’

The findings are likely to add to calls from the Lib Dems to scrap jail terms for possession of drugs for personal use – a move certain to infuriate Tories. Earlier this year, Mr Clegg pledged to abolish prison terms for the possession of drugs for personal use, including Class A substances. 

However, a Home Office source said: ‘The Lib Dems have blown £40,000 of taxpayers’ money on a magical mystery tour around the world looking at countries with soft drugs laws.

‘But whatever they now say they want, we will never allow decriminalisation to happen.’

Mary Brett, of anti-drugs pressure group Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘Of course decriminalisation would lead to more drug use. There would be an upsurge and a corresponding upsurge in crime, people suffering mental health problems and deaths.’

The report has put the Coalition on a collision path - with the Tories vowing to 'never' decriminalise drugs

The report is especially concerning because it comes just weeks after a definitive study into the effects of long-term cannabis smoking destroyed the argument that the drug is safe.

Instead, the research paper, by a drugs adviser to the World Health Organisation, concluded cannabis is highly addictive, causes mental health problems and opens the door to hard drugs use.

The Home Office said it was considering a blanket ban on the sale of ‘legal highs’ being sold on the High Street.

The drugs, which mimic the effect of illegal substances such as ecstasy and cocaine, are no longer the preserve of specialist ‘head shops’, and are now widely for sale in takeaways, petrol stations, newsagents and even pet shops. Recently released figures show there were 60 deaths related to legal highs last year – up from 52 in 2012 and 29 in 2011.
