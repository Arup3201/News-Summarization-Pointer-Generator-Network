Living on the edge: Mary Berry is going against the British tradition and serves her cheese before dessert

For decades she has been hailed as the definitive guide to traditional food.

But when it comes to the order in which it is eaten, Mary Berry is rather less conventional.

And shortly after she declared on her new BBC Two show Mary Berry Cooks that she insists on following the French and serving her cheese before dessert, it quickly became apparent she had divided opinion between viewers and not all of them agreed.

Miss Berry announced on her Monday night show: ‘At my dinner parties i like to serve cheese after the main course because you still have red wine in the glass and it goes very well with the cheese. And that is what they do in France and I think they set a good example.’

And the queen of Bake Off added: ‘I also like to bring my dinner party to a spectacular close by serving the dessert.’

One of the first to respond on social networking site Twitter yesterday was BBC Radio 4 presenter Jane Garvey who said: ‘It’s the morning after Mary Berry said she serves cheese before pudding. Nothing will ever be quite the same again. #dinner party’.

Disagreeing with the 78-year-old host, another fan said: ‘Cheese before pudding? Is Mary Berry mad??’

Another added: ‘Serving cheese before pudding? Corr she’s a cheeky one.’

Backing Miss Berry and criticising the unrefined pallets of the British, celebrity chef Theo Randall ,said: ‘It is a very continental way of dinning to eat the cheese before desert, and to be honest the French do have to right idea.

‘It is much more refined to finish with a sweet pallet because it is the way a meal should progress. Often the wine served for previous courses can be enjoyed in the cheese course.

‘I think the Brits could learn something from the Europeans and therefore conclude their meals properly, and enjoy their dessert.’

Mr Randall, who runs an award-winning restaurant at the InterContinental hotel in London said the tradition for the British to consume cheese last stems from the home grown art of port-making: ‘It became very much a social thing to move away from the table and hack away at the stilton and crack open the port after pudding.

‘Although we probably don’t dish out the port as quickly today, the tradition of having cheese last has stuck. But if you go to any restaurant, which leans to the refines of continental dining you will always see the cheese trolley wheeled out before dessert.’

Continental and controversial: Mary Berry said she prefers to served the cheese before the pudding as cheese often goes with the red wine still in the glass from the main course

The cheese course is originally thought to have started in Russia and was later introduced by the French before dessert.

According to experts serving cheese before dessert enables guests to pair the wine that accompanies the entrée with milder cheeses before moving on to blue cheeses which works well with the sweet and fortified wines that can them accompany dessert.

Another theory is that as the French traditionally serve salad with vinaigrette after the main the cheese acts as a ‘neutraliser’ to cleanse the palate before dessert is served.

Flying the flag for home traditions, Camilla Schneideman from the Leith School of Food and Wine, claimed the Brits choose to eat cheese last because it is more sociable.

She said: ‘The Brits traditionally choose to serve their cheese last, it is often the natural move away from the sweet course and allows dinners to continue to enjoy the evenings wine.

‘Traditionally the French would serve the cheese before, but for many UK dinner parties it is often a social decision to serve after.

‘Many hosts believe their dinner party will stay longer if they are grazing over a cheese board at the end of the meal.’

Miss Berry, CBE studied at Le Cordon Bleu school in France, before working in a number of cooking related jobs.

She has published more than 70 cookery books and hosted several television series for the BBC and Thames Television.

The star is an occasional contributor to Woman’s Hour and Saturday Kitchen and has been a judge on the BBC Two television programme The Great British Bake Off since its launch in 2010.
