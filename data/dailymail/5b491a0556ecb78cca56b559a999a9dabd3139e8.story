Trial: Max Clifford pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court on Thursday

Hollywood legend Oliver Reed ‘liked young girls’, the Max Clifford trial sensationally heard today.

The millionaire PR guru claimed to represent the Oliver Twist star to a teenage recruitment consultant - and said he had to cover up the actor’s controversial sexual preferences, jurors heard.

The consultant, just 19 at the time, said Clifford made the shock revelations during a meeting about a PA job at his Bond Street offices.

She said: ‘He said it was working as his PA and as part of that it would be looking after his list of celebrities, taking care of their needs.

‘He named a lot of celebrities, and one that I remember is Oliver Reed.

‘I was very young and didn’t really know who the other ones were very much. I remember clearly Oliver Reed.

‘He said that some of his clients, and specifically named Oliver Reed, had sexual preferences and he explained that Oliver Reed liked young girls.

‘And that as a publicist, this was problematic for him and it would be part of the role I was there for, to protect the clients.

‘He just said they had different sexual preferences and I remember him specifically saying about Oliver Reed, that he liked young girls.’

She said that very quickly Clifford began interviewing her for the job and quizzing her about how she could help ‘protect Oliver Reed’.

Oliver Reed, who starred in Oliver Twist died from a sudden heart attack during a break from filming Gladiator in Valletta, Malta in 1999 when he was 61 years old

The woman said: ‘I do remember thinking it was a very glamorous job and it all sounded very exciting being involved in celebrities and celebrities’ affairs.

‘I remember thinking it was something about helping them not to get into trouble.

‘I offered up an idea of how that might be done as part of my interview. What I suggested was we could find girls for him that looked young but weren’t young, and were of legal age.

‘It was only afterwards that I realised exactly what I was suggesting - that somehow I might have been suggesting that we could procure girls for people.

‘I meant just surround him with available people that looked younger.’

After the meeting, said to have taken place in 1978 and lasting a mammoth five hours, the pair caught a taxi.

Allegations: Clifford, 70, from Hersham in Surrey, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls

But Clifford is said to have ‘launched himself’ at the teenager, groped her and tried to ‘passionately’ kiss her.

Choosing not to give evidence behind a white curtain to protect her anonymity, she said: ‘He started trying to kiss me.

‘He kind of launched himself at me actually, and started trying to kiss me on the mouth. I tried to push him off and hold him off.

‘I put my hand up to hold him off and hold his body off because he was pushing his body onto me. He was trying to give me a passionate kiss.’

Asked by Rosina Cottage QC, prosecuting, ‘did you want it?’, she laughed and replied ‘no’.

‘Apart from anything he was much, much, much, much older than me.

‘Particularly at that age, he wasn’t a young attractive man - he was an old guy.

‘He was trying to kiss me, he started trying to grab at me. Grabbing my breasts.’

She managed to fight him off and dust herself down. But Clifford unleashed a foul-mouthed attack branding her a ‘p***k tease’ and telling her to ‘f*** off’ before storming out of the cab without paying the fare, jurors heard.

She said when she returned to her office ‘I told them I didn’t believe there was a job and I didn’t believe it was safe to send young girls over to Mr Clifford’s office anyway.’

Clifford chuckled to himself and shrugged his shoulders while she spoke.

Earlier in the trial the court heard that Clifford told one of his alleged victims that actress Julie Christie said he should take the girl’s virginity so she would fall in love with him.

He is accused of repeatedly abusing her in his car in 1977 when she was 15.

The woman told jurors that Clifford also suggested he had had a sexual relationship with Hollywood star Christie.

She said: ‘He asked me which actors I liked. I said Julie Christie.

‘He said that he was her agent and he said he talked regularly to her and mentioned her on several occasions.

‘I remember him saying to me he had spoken to Julie Christie and - because this had happened to her as well, by that presumably he meant the abuse that he was doing to me - she said he should take my virginity because it would be my first and then I would fall in love with him and be 100 per cent loyal to him.’

The woman broke down in tears in the witness box as she was accused of being ‘obsessed’ about Clifford.

Richard Horwell QC, defending, questioned her about research she had carried out on the internet.

He asked: ‘During the period in which you were having counselling, did you become almost obsessed with Mr Clifford?’

She replied: ‘I was very frightened and I was worried he would find out about me.’

 WOMAN ONE: One indecent assault in January 1966

WOMAN TWO: One indecent assault in 1975

WOMAN THREE: One indecent assault between July 1977 and August 1978 and on three occasions outside that period

WOMAN FOUR: One indecent assault in 1978

WOMAN FIVE: One indecent assault in 1982

WOMAN SIX: One indecent assault between January 1982 and December 1984, and another outside that period

WOMAN SEVEN: One indecent assault between January 1983 and December 1984

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told how reporting Clifford to the police in 2012 was the most difficult thing she had ever done.

She said: 'It has been the worst thing of my life that has happened.

'I didn’t want to, I felt that if I didn’t go I would always be a coward and always be ashamed that I hadn’t done anything. I felt I had to do it.'

The alleged victim went to the police after she saw the PR guru talking on TV about murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, the court heard.

She summoned the courage to come forward after growing 'frustrated' by Clifford’s 'hypocrisy', a friend told jurors.

She said: 'He was in the media a lot about the Milly Dowler case and she was getting increasingly frustrated because of the hypocrisy of the things he was saying in the media.

'Things like, how could a paedophile do that to a 13 year-old girl?'

A psychotherapist told the court that she treated the alleged victim in 2011.

‘She said she was sexually abused,’ the court heard.

‘She didn’t give precise details of the abuse but it was too horrific for her.’

The counsellor said her client looked like ‘she might vomit’ before naming Clifford as her abuser.

Clifford, wearing a grey suit, white shirt and grey tie, listened to her evidence using a hearing loop in the dock - and angrily huffed, tutted and shook his head as the alleged victim spoke.

The woman said she met Clifford in 1977 while on holiday with her family in Torremolinos, Spain. She claims he impressed her parents and told them he could find her modelling work.

Earlier the jury was read a letter from the alleged victim to Clifford claiming that he had 'raped and blackmailed her'.

Clifford, 70, from Hersham in Surrey, is accused of 11 counts of indecent assault against seven women and girls.

He denies all the charges and the trial continues.
