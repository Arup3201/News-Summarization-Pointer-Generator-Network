It's time to reclaim that hour of sleep you lost last spring.

Texans and most other Americans are turning back clocks this weekend for the annual shift back to standard time.

For many, that means making the switch before hitting the sack Saturday night, even though the change doesn't become official until 2 a.m. Sunday.

It's that time of year again: Don't forget to switch the clock back an hour before going to bed Saturday night

Residents of Hawaii, most of Arizona and some U.S. territories don't have to change; daylight saving time is not observed in those places.

Public safety officials say this is also a good time to put a new battery in the smoke alarm, no matter where you live.

Daylight saving time returns at 2 a.m. local time the second Sunday in March — March 8, 2015.
