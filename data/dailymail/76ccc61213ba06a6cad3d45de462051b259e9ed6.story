Bright blue facepaint isn’t normally the best way to blend in.

But these butterflies think 12-year-old Sakura Radscheit’s camouflage is the bee’s knees.

They flocked around her at the launch of a butterfly exhibit at RHS Wisley in Surrey.

Mesmerising: Sakura Radscheit, 12, beamed as five species of butterfly landed on her face and head

Wince: Her sister, Momiji, 3, was not as excited by the winged creatures who zoomed towards her face paint

And her three-year-old sister Momiji also joined in the fun - wincing at first before giggling as the beautiful creatures flocked to her face.

Hundreds of the insects were released into the glasshouses at the famous garden, where they perched on visitors’ clothes and enjoyed the jungle of exotic plants.

A collection of chrysalis sculptures by Oxford-based artist Jane Wafer were also commissioned for the exhibit.

Picture perfect: But she warmed to them as she sat among the leaves in the famous garden's greenhouse

Rare: The rare moment happened at the Royal Horticultural Society's famous garden where butterflies are being exhibited alongside numerous other insects until March 9

Five, including a vivid blue South-East Asian Clipper, landed on Sakura and Momiji’s faces and heads.

The glasshouses at Wisley, run by the Royal Horticultural Society, opened in 2007 and are the size of ten tennis courts.

The butterflies will be on display there until Sunday March 9.
