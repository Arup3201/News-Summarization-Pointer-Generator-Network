When Helen Coughlan’s next door neighbour extended his home, good relations went out of the window.

A furious Mrs Coughlan has been left with a view of a brick wall – and claims it has knocked £100,000 off the value of her four-bedroom home. A similar house sold recently for £475,000.

Now the 52-year-old wants Tariq Ahmed to demolish his extension, which sits just 24 inches from her window.

No world outside: Helen Coughlan fears she will never be able to sell her four-bed semi-detached house after her neighbour put up a brick wall just 24 inches away from her window

No light: The brick wall blocks out all natural light, plunging her newly designed kitchen and dining room into complete darkness

She said: ‘The extension wrecked not only the view, but damaged my walls and now they tell me my home has subsidence problems.

‘My house used to be lovely and light but now it’s dark and dingy. I have to have lights on in my kitchen all the time.

‘He
 has not even finished the outside wall. He says he has not got the 
money, but he doesn’t care because he doesn’t have to look at it. It’s 
made our lives a living hell.’

Dispute: Mrs Coughlan, who lives at the property in Woodford Bridge, London with her husband Paul, her two sons and her mother, says the issue is a 'joke' and claims it hasn't just affected her view but also damaged her walls

Shadow: The extension on Tariq Ahmed's home (circled) was added in 2010, four years after Mrs Coughlan completed her loft conversion

A homeowner is required to get planning permission when they build something new, make a major change to their building or change the use of their building (by reverting it to a building premesis for example).

A council can take action if a developer has planning permission but is not complying with the conditions that were approved. They may not be following the approved plans or could have failed to submit some formation before commencing development.

Mr Ahmed submitted planning applications, which were subsequently approved, but the completed project was bigger than the original plans.

Your right to light dates back to the Prescription Act 1832, and was updated in Rights of Light Act 1959 .

Any development can potentially block the light coming into your home.

The most common problem is where light is blocked to a side window by a high wall, that may have been built without the need for planning permission. However Redbridge Council, the local authority in control of the area, state on their website that they will not become involved in right to light disputes.

Neighbours' rights to light apply irrespective of having obtained planning permission or building under the permitted development rules.

The right is automatically acquired if the light has been enjoyed through defined apertures of a building - windows - uninterrupted for 20 years. It can also have been granted by deed.

Action: The local council has ruled the extension was bigger than Tarid Ahmed applied for - but have not ordered him to tear it down because it only constitutes 'loss of light'

Building problems: Mrs Coughlan claims her neighbour's extension has not only spoiled her view but has also caused subsidence issues

The
 saga began after Mrs Coughlan – who moved into the semi-detached house 
in Woodford Bridge, north-east London, with husband Paul, 48, and sons 
Patrick, now 22, and Sean, 21, in 1999 – redesigned her home, adding a 
loft and  roof conversion.

But
 a few years later, Mr Ahmed also added an upstairs room to his home – 
and his relationship with Mrs Coughlan hit a brick wall.

With
 just two feet between his new room and her new window, all natural 
light through her kitchen and dining room windows is blocked, leaving 
her with no view apart from the brickwork.

Redbridge
 Council has ruled Mr Ahmed’s extension is bigger than it had been in 
the planning application granted in 2010, but has not ordered him to 
tear it down because it constitutes only ‘loss of light’. Mrs Coughlan, a
 carer, said: ‘It is unacceptable that the council wants to wash its 
hands of the situation. It has a responsibility to sort it out.’

In
 2012, she took Mr Ahmed to court in a civil case over the right to 
light, and he agreed to an out-of-court settlement of £30,000.

Neighbours on the other side of Mr Ahmed’s property, Veronica and Tony Martin, have also had problems with the building work.

In April 2011 they found a huge crack down the length of their house. The work cost £13,000 to fix, which Mr Ahmed paid for.

The
 council said in a statement: ‘The council is satisfied it applied the 
relevant planning policies and procedures correctly.  The “right to 
light” is a private law right which is not, of itself, a qualifying 
factor when determining planning applications.

‘It
 is an applicant’s responsibility to consider the relevance of the 
general law, including any possible right to light and party wall 
issues.’

Mr Ahmed, 45, who 
lives with wife Kay and their four children, said: ‘I refute all the 
allegations, they are all false. There was a garage here before so she 
[Mrs Coughlan] always had a reduced light. She’s accepted the 
compensation and we’re now being victimised when we had permission to 
build the extension.’

The row is due to be featured in an episode of Channel 5 series Neighbour Disputes next month.

Close: Mr Ahmed strayed from the original plans and in December 2012 Helen took him to court in a civil case and he agreed to an out of court settlement of £30,000

Workmanship: Picture shows parts of the extension crumbling away. Mrs Coughlan, who works as a carer for her mother says the building has caused 'subsidence issues'

Rear view: The extension at the back of the house is close to Mrs Coughlan's roof conversion, which she put up before Mr Ahmed built the extension
