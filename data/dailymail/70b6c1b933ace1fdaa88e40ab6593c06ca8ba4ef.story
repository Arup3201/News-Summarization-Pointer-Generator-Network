A terminally ill mum is aiming to raise £250,000 for pioneering treatment in a bid to see her young daughter grow up.

Alex Cole-Swann, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, has cervical cancer and without the money, she fears she won't live to see her two-year-old girl start school.

Friends and family of the 32-year-old mother-of-one have now launched an appeal to help her fulfill her sole wish of always being there for Willow Mae.

Alex Cole-Swann, 32,  and husband Nathan, 25, are hoping to raise £250k to give Alex life-saving treatment so she can see her two-year-old daughter Willow Mae grow-up

Alex, who is married to husband Nathan, said: 'All I want is to see her grow up, be there to celebrate her birthdays, walk her to school and be the Mummy she needs me to be.

'But without treatment, I won't survive. The cancer will kill me and my daughter will grow up without a Mummy.'

Alex was first diagnosed with cervical cancer last April. She underwent intensive courses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

But she was told three weeks ago by doctors at Weston Park Hospital in Sheffield, where she was treated, that there is nothing more they can do.

Determined not to just give in, Alex researched alternative treatments to help battle the cruel disease.

Her quest took her to London's Harley Street where she saw a leading cancer specialist Professor.

He told her about a treatment which is being used in the United States known as PD-L1 immunotherapy. It helps a person's body fight cancer cells by recognising those cells as impostors.

However, it isn't available on the NHS and costs £25,000 per session. Alex will need 10 to 12 sessions.

The treatment is Alex's only hope to win the battle which has left her exhausted, confused and unable to sit and play with her young daughter Willow Mae

Initially the council information officer was given the good news that the company developing the treatment are looking for patients to try it on Britain - and they were willing to treat them for free.

But then came a cruel twist. Because Alex had a tube inserted directly into her kidneys as part of a previous course of treatment, she was deemed not suitable for the trial.

It was then that the family decided the only course of action open to them was to pay. So they launched Quest For Life appeal in a desperate attempt to save Alex's life.

The treatment is Alex's only hope to win the battle which has left her exhausted, confused and unable to sit and play with her young daughter.

Her husband, Nathan, 25, a self-employed plumber said: 'It has been the worst year of our lives.

'It's been an awful emotional roller coaster as we have watched Alex fight this cruel and horrible disease.'

Six months after Alex was initially diagnosed, she was given the all clear.

Nathan said: 'We were so pleased – we couldn't have wished for anything more. It was like all our Christmas's had come at once.

'But very quickly we knew something wasn't right. Alex was still in a lot of pain. She told her doctors and they carried out more tests. Initially they all came back clear and doctors thought the pain may have been caused by the radiotherapy.'

Alex,  with Nathan and Willow Mae above, says: 'I desperately want to watch Alex ride her first bike, take her to school on her first day, make all her birthday cakes, so I have to do everything I can to make that possible.'

But earlier this month, medics told Alex the cancer had, as she had expected, returned. 

Nathan said: 'Alex had been in a lot of pain and she knew in her heart of hearts something was very wrong. Initially tests came back clear, but earlier this month we were given the devastating blow that the cancer was back.

'Only this time it was more aggressive and we were given the horrendous news that there was nothing more the doctors could do.

'We were all absolutely heartbroken. Alex was crushed. All she has ever wanted was to be a Mum and watch our little girl grow up. 

'Like any parents she wants to be there for our daughter and see those very special days.'

Alex said: 'I desperately want to watch Alex ride her first bike, take her to school on her first day, make all her birthday cakes, so I have to do everything I can to make that possible.'

This week Alex and Nathan travelled to London for her first session of treatment which has been paid for by her parents. 

Alex's anxious family are setting up a charity and have raised £3,500 and are making a heartfelt plea for people to help pay for the costly treatment

And her anxious family are setting up a charity and making a heartfelt plea for people to help pay for the costly treatment. Up to now they have raised £3,500, but still have a very long way to go.

An emotional Alex, who says she is in constant excruciating pain, said she is desperate to live if only for Willow's sake. But sometimes the pain is so intense she feels she just can't face life as it is.

She adds: 'The pain is so bad that there isn't a minute that goes by when I don't feel in excruciating agony.'

It is only through the help of her friends and family that she is able to carry on.

She said: 'People I haven¹t seen or spoken to for years have been in touch and I¹m overwhelmed by their support. It really does keep me going.

'Everyone is doing so much but I feel so low and in so much pain I can't do anything, I can't even walk further than a few yards.

'There are times when I feel like pulling the duvet up over my head and just giving in. But then I think about Willow, how much I love her, and how much she needs her Mummy.

'I have to fight this for her sake. I need to be here when she comes home from her first day at school to feel me about her day. I can't leave her so young and miss out on so much of her life. I have to keep fighting and do everything I can to battle this horrible illness.'
