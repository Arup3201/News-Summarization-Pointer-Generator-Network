A new mobile application in the works will allow vigilante meter maids to cash-in on parking violations.

SpotSquad, currently in beta testing, will give users a portion of the parking fine as a reward for reporting illegally-parked cars, according to FoxNews.com.

Developed by a 10-person Canadian tech startup in Winnipeg, the app aims to crowd source parking enforcement.

Target: Users of a forthcoming moblie app SpotSquad can get a cut of the fine when they report illegally-parked cars

The app is simple enough: When users spot a car parked illegally, they snap a picture. The picture is tagged with a GPS location and optical character recognition records the car's license plate number. Users also choose from a drop-down list of parking infractions, from 'time expired' to 'double parked'.

Using the car's location, a report is automatically sent to the parking lot's operator or local law enforcement, who dispatch personnel to issue a ticket or have the car towed.

The tentative business model has the company taking a percentage of the fine paid by a driver and splitting it with the user who reported the car in the first place. If users submit multiple successful reports, they'll get paid at an increasing rate and will be awarded traditional military ranks from Private to General. Users can also choose to give their cut to charity.

Chris Johnson, one of the app's co-founders, told CTVNews.ca that they believe lots of people are open to the concept because of the number of accounts set up already.

Spotting: The app's users will first choose from a drop-down list of parking violations and snap a picture, which digitally records the GPS location of a car and its license plate number

'We're getting the feeling this is the kind of thing everyone [is going to want to have] on their phone but no one admits to,' he said.

Report: When users rack-up a lot of successful reports, they'll get an increasingly larger cut of the parking fine, which is first paid to the mobile company

Johnson told FoxNews.com, that the photos and users' reports can't be used in court, so official evidence must be collected by those parking operators and traffic cops who get word of the violation.

A pilot program of the app should 
begin in Winnipeg by July, but Johnson said he sees an opportunity to 
expand the app's reach in America.

'We're open to having conversations anywhere where there's parking that needs to be controlled,' Johnson told CTVNews.ca.

A similar, though less self-serving, app is already used in America.

Parking
Mobility allows trained volunteers to snap shots of cars illegally 
parked in disabled spots. A portion of the fines from those reports are 
given to the user's favorite charity.

That Texas-based company took years to negotiate agreements with police departments and cities, CTVNews.ca reported.

The
Canadian app might cause some legal issues, lawyer Brian Bowman told 
CTV Winnipeg. Users wouldn't be bound by the same privacy laws as public
sector workers who document illegally parked cars.

'You are empowering citizens and paying them to arguably act as an agent for you,' Bowman said.

It also has the potential to tick-off those whose cars are reported.

'Just read the signs, follow the rules and you wonâ€™t have a problem,' Johnson told FoxNews.com.
