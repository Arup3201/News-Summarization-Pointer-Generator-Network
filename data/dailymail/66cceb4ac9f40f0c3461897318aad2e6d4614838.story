In the latest of ambitious building projects, officials in Dubai have confirmed work will start on designing 'Aladdin City.'

Comprising six towers, all connected by moving walkways, the development is inspired by the tales of Aladdin from the Middle Eastern folk Tale The Arabian Nights and the more modern Disney blockbuster.

The towers are said to be similar in design to the genie lamp, and are set to shimmer golden in the sunlight.

There will be six predominant points to the project, which will be built in Dubai Creek

'We plan to start work on the project next year; we have our own funds to finance the project,' director-general Hussain Nasser Lootah told the Future of Dubai website. 

The project was announced publicly in April last year, and will include commercial and hotel areas, as well as parking for 900 cars.

The highest of the towers will measure 34 storeys; the development will spread some 1,500 feet along Dubai Creek, encompassing 4,000 acres in total.

The area is a popular spot for old wooden fishing boats, and maintains an air of tradition about it; the new plans will fall outside the area set to be named a UNESCO World Heritage site.

The development will have three main towers which look like something out of a Disney movie

'The project aims to develop towers to be the icons of legends of the past with a touch of beauty and tourism characteristic of the city, added Lootah. 

'It comes in the prime location of Dubai Creek maintaining the activities of the port heritage.' 

The total cost for the project has not been revealed.

Situated close to 'Aladdin City' is Dubai's other extravagant design of the Burj Khalifa - the world's tallest building.

Measuring 2,722ft, the construction began on January 6, 2004, with the exterior of the structure completed on October 1, 2009. 

Work is scheduled to begin on the development in 2016, but the cost of the project has not been revealed

The building officially opened on January 4, 2010, and it is part of the 490-acre development called Downtown Dubai.

However, another ambitious project has hit a stumbling block.

The Dubai Eye, which was billed to be the world's biggest ferris wheel, was supposed to be open to the public this year, but this has been pushed back until 2018.

Set to be 690ft tall, and attract more than three million visitors a year, the attraction is part of a one billion pound entertainment project called The Bluewaters Island.

The Burj Khalifa in Dubai is the world's tallest building at 2,722ft tall and took around six years to complete

The 'Aladdin City' will add yet more enchantment to Dubai, whose mix of modern architecture to middle eastern design is heralded
