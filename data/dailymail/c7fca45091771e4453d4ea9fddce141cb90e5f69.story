A landmark step towards the creation of artificial life has been taken by scientists who have built a functioning synthetic yeast chromosome.

Their achievement breaks new ground by taking the emerging field of synthetic biology beyond the limits of bacteria and viruses.

The scientists improved upon the design of the yeast chromosome by stripping out ‘junk’ DNA and said the technique can be used to give chromosomes new properties.

Scientists made 50,000 changes to the DNA code to make the yeast 'III' chromosome tougher and give it new properties. Chromosomes are tiny packages of DNA that contain the genes in which the 'book of life' is written. A sample of the yeast is pictured

Chromosomes are thread-like structures located inside the nucleus of animal and plant cells.

Each one is made of protein and a single molecule of deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA, which contains the specific instructions that make each type of living creature unique.

Chromosomes vary in number and shape among living things.

Most bacteria have one or two circular chromosomes, but humans, along with other animals and plants, have linear chromosomes that are arranged in pairs within the nucleus of the cell.

While the research is in its early stages, it could lead to artificial strains of yeast being used in medicine, vaccines and even biofuels.

Chromosomes are tiny packages of DNA that contain the genes in which the 'book of life' is written.

Previously, scientists have built artificial versions of bacterial chromosomes, as well as viral DNA, but this is the first time the chromosome of a eukaryote - a higher organism whose cells contain nuclei, unlike bacteria - has been created.

Unlike genetic engineering, which involves transferring genes from one organism to another, synthetic biology involves designing and then constructing new genetic material from scratch.

U.S. synthetic biology pioneer Dr Jef Boeke, Director of the New York University Langone Medical Centre, said: ‘Our research moves the needle in synthetic biology from theory to reality.

‘This work represents the biggest step yet in an international effort to construct the full genome of synthetic yeast.’

Writing in the journal Science, the team describes how the chromosome - dubbed 'synIII' - was constructed and successfully incorporated into brewer's yeast.

Scientists removed redundant parts of the 'real' chromosome.

This reduced the size of the synthetic chromosome by around 15 per cent.

They made further changes to the genetic code to introduce variations in the chromosome different to those in the original one.

They then integrated their 'synlll' creation into a living yeast cell and showed that the cells were 'remarkably normal'.

The chromosome is the most extensively altered ever made.

Dr Boeke said they behave almost identically to wild yeast cells but with their new capabilities they can do things that wild yeast cannot.

Britain is involved in the international effort to synthesise 16 yeast chromosomes and last year the government dedicated £1million to the yeast project out of its £60million budget for synthetic biology.

The seven-year-long project involved piecing together some 273,871 DNA components. The scientists also tweaked nature's design by removing repeated DNA sections thought to be unnecessary to reproduction and growth.

Regions of ‘junk’ DNA that appeared to perform no function were taken out, as well as ‘jumping gene’ segments known to move around randomly and introduce mutations.

‘When you change the genome you're gambling,’ said Dr Boeke. ‘One wrong change can kill the cell.

‘We have made over 50,000 changes to the DNA code in the chromosome and our yeast still alive. That is remarkable. It shows that our synthetic chromosome is hardy, and it endows the yeast with new properties.’

Sixty undergraduate students were recruited to tie together short snippets of the synthetic DNA into stretches 750 to 1,000 units long.

It was only in 2010 that Dr Craig Venter created the first synthetic genome for bacteria and this latest research has sparked an on-going international mission to reconstruct the entire yeast genome over the next few years.

Yeast chromosome III was chosen for synthesis because it is among the smallest of the 16 yeast chromosomes. It controls how yeast cells ‘mate’ and undergo genetic change.

Medicine: Scientists could make synthetic chromosomes for yeast cells to speed up the rate of yeast evolution. This means that they could create strains designed for use in certain complex medicines.

A company in California has already used synthetic biology to create a strain of yeast that can produce artemisinin, an ingredient for an anti-malarial drug.

Biofuels: The scientists said that new types of yeast chromosomes could improve the efficiency of producing biofuels, made in the fermenting process.

The organism shares roughly a third of its 6,000 genes - stretches of DNA that encode for proteins - with humans.

Large sections of yeast DNA were manipulated by the scientists using a ‘scrambling’ technique that involves shuffling genes like a deck of cards.

‘We can pull together any group of cards, shuffle the order and make millions and millions of different decks, all in one small tube of yeast,’ Dr Boeke added.

‘Now that we can shuffle the genomic deck, it will allow us to ask: Can we make a deck of cards with a better hand for making yeast survive under any of a multitude of conditions, such as tolerating higher alcohol levels.’

The research paves the way to synthetic strains of yeast that could be used in the manufacture of medicines or vaccines.

Synthetic yeast could also bolster the development of efficient biofuels, the scientists claim.
