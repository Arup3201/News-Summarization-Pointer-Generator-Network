What could be better than a free ticket to see your favourite sports team? Well maybe if it came complete with a hot date to sweeten the deal.

That's exactly the kind of once-in-a-lifetime deal one man offered on the Gainesville, Florida Craigslist, when he gave readers the chance to take his step-daughter to see the Tennessee Volunteers.

Gary Yates explained that 27-year-old Jessica Flanagan's date had suddenly backed out of their arrangement to go the Volunteers' forthcoming September 21 away clash with the Florida Gators.

Free ticket! The advert posted by Gary Yates on the Gainesville, Florida Craigslist personals site soliciting a date to accompany his 27-year-old step-daughter Jessica Flanagan to a college football game this Saturday

But instead of swallowing the $150 loss he posted her pictures to the notorious personal ads site in the hope of finding an eligible gentleman to accompany her.

The advert, decorated with pictures of the attractive young woman, read: 'My step-daughter's date backed out (his loss, your gain) for the game...

'Free ticket for the Tennessee-Florida Football game this Saturday (cost to me, $150) on the 40 for the right gentleman. You must be an attractive, professional, single well educated gentleman, with a good sense of humor, 25-33. You also must not be threatened by an attractive, professional, single well educated lady, (as she is). If you do not qualify, please pass this ad to a friend.

'The fine print: I lied! (Sorry...not totally free). Your cost will be a modest dinner, drinks and delightful conversation with her before or after the game.'

With its reputation for serial killers and prostitution, many parents would perhaps be nervous at the thought of sending their child off with an unknown person solicited from Craiglist.

But what the advert did not reveal was that the date would be fully chaperoned. 

Mr Yates told Fox Sports that he and his wife Brenda are also flying down for the game on Saturday. The chosen one will sit with them and Miss Flanagan at the game.

Chaperoned: Mr Yeats's advert did not reveal that he and his wife would also be travelling with Miss Flanagan to the Ben Hill Griffin Stadium in Florida to watch the Volunteers take on the Gators this Saturday

The lifelong Volunteers fan said his inbox had been inundated with offers since the ad - now removed - was posted on Monday night.

'I've had a couple of lighthearted responses, one of them was hilarious, but yeah, it's been mostly serious responses — I would guess, I don't know, 30 or 40,' he said.

And he added that he had run the idea by Miss Flanagan before posting the advert and she would have the final say over who would be invited.

'I wouldn't do something like that without her permission,' he said.
