A Chinese father-of-four took his own life after he was fined for breaching the country's strict one-child policy.

Wang Guangrong, 37, a farmer, had three daughters and a son - a family he was proud of, but which was frowned on by local authorities.

Like many poor farmers in Wantun township in southwest China's Guizhou province, he saw the children as an asset and decided to flaunt the policy.

Like many poor farmers in China's Guizhou province, Wang decided to flout the country's one-child policy, seeing his children as valuable workers

But unlike many of his fellow labourers, Wang also wanted to give the children an education, and it was when he sent his offspring to school that authorities tried to fine him

Unlike the other labourers he was determined to give his children an education, but when he sent them to school in March he was told he had to pay the equivalent of  £2,000 for their classes.

Unable to pay the sum, and unwilling to bring his children up without them going to school, he decided to kill himself.

'He couldn't take it,' said his widow Wu Jinmin, 36. 'He said to me before he cut his wrists: "What did we bring them into the world for, to be as dumb as cattle? I cannot see my children grow up uneducated".'

Now officials have paid Wang's wife (left) £2,000 for a new house, and allowed her children to go to school

The family are now in the process of building themselves a new home following Wang's death

His suicide embarrassed local authorities so much they have now paid his widow an estimated £20,000 in compensation and promised to buy her a new house.

Jinmin added: 'They said after his death that extra births, although not encouraged, should not stop the children being educated.

'I wish my husband were still with me, but I think he would be happy where he is knowing that our family will be educated after all, even if we are not.

'The children miss him the most. They are all very sad.'

Wang's wife says that, on the day her husband killed himself, he asked her 'What did we bring [children] into the world for, to be as dumb as cattle?'
