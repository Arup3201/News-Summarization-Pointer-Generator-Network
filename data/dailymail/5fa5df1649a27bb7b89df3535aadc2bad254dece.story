Bode Miller's wife is now saying that it was 'fate' that she had a miscarriage earlier this year because they wouldn't have been able to spend as much time with his baby from a previous relationship.

How much time they are able to spend with the 9-month old is the basis of a contentious custody battle between the Olympian skier and his ex-girlfriend Sara McKenna.

McKenna, an ex-marine who moved from California to New York when she was seven months pregnant, was awarded temporary custody of her young son over the Thanksgiving holiday, but now the bitter exes and their legal teams will be back in a Manhattan court next week for the next hearing.

Airing their views: Bode Miller and his wife Morgan Beck, who he married shortly after ending his relationship with Sara McKenna, announced that she miscarried in January

Holding on tight: Just before Thanksgiving, a judge overturned the previous custody ruling that gave the Millers the rights to the child he had with Sara McKenna (pictured), allowing her to care for the child until December 9

Miller met McKenna through a high-end dating service after they both expressed interest in settling down.

Their relationship didn't last long, however, but McKenna discovered she was pregnant with his child by the time he had already begun dating his now-wife Morgan Beck, a professional volleyball player.

McKenna later released a text she sent to Miller after asking him to join her at an ultrasound appointment. He refused to go and wrote: 'U made this choice against my wish'.

In October, McKenna warned Miller that there was a possibility that she would be moving across the country: 'Just a heads up, I met with an advisor from Columbia today and we will probably be moving there in the fall.'

That same month, he married Beck after dating for just five months and in November he submitted a 'Petition to Establish Parental Relationship' in a California court, identifying himself as the father of a child who was not yet born.

Bode and Morgan announced that she was pregnant weeks later, only to reveal shortly after that she had a miscarriage.

'It was awful. Morgan and I hadn't planned on getting pregnant, but we were excited. In hindsight, now, we can see what an incredible challenge having two babies would have been. I don't believe in fate- that everything happens for a reason- but Morgan does,' Bode said in an interview with Us Weekly, a portion of which is online.

That reason is the fact that they want to gain more legal access to Bode's son with Sara, even though the relationship has grown so contentious that they refer to the boy using different names.

Sara calls him Sam after giving the boy Bode's legal name, Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna, when she gave birth to him in New York in February.

Fighting for his son: Miller and his wife had custody of the boy, who they refer to as Nate while his mother calls him Sam, for months leading up to the reversal before Thanksgiving

Evolving: Morgan, a professional volleyball player, got pregnant expectantly but had a miscarriage shortly after announcing it

Bode later petitioned a court in his home state of California to add Nathaniel as a middle name in honor of his brother who died in April. Now he and Morgan refer to the boy as Nate.

The couple argues that McKenna has been conducting a virtual smear campaign against them, and while they maintain that they have not fought back, they are changing their ways now because it will effect the skier’s career as he trains for the Winter Olympics.

Her strike back: McKenna posted multiple photos of she and 'Sam' over Thanksgiving, including this one of them at the Macy's parade

Bode, 36, told The Boston Globe on Thursday that Sara, who is now studying at Columbia University, is directly attacking his brand.

'(McKenna has) been directly attacking that. It’s so pointless in this case because it has no bearing on anything. It doesn’t make any difference,' he told the paper.

'It’s just, when you are in a position where things aren’t going your way — my wife does it all the time if she’s losing a fight or something, she just switches the fight to something else that she thinks she can win at. Just totally changes the argument to something else. It’s not a bad tactic. It’s just kind of pointless.'

Other factors are weighing in on the argument now, however, turning the case into a question of women's rights as one New York judge initially ruled that McKenna was 'forum shopping' for more favorable courts by moving from California in her third trimester. He awarded custody to Miller.

After that September 3 decision, McKenna told The New York Times that her ex and new wife wasted no time uprooting the boy as they came back to her apartment 'took the baby out of my arms, dropped it in a car seat and drove away.'

A second judge then reversed that decision though the case is still ongoing.

The Millers arrived at the Manhattan court with 'Nate' in tow last week and McKenna took the child after the hearing as she was granted custody over the Thanksgiving holiday and through till the next hearing on December 9.

Bi-coastal contention: After meeting Miller in San Diego, McKenna moved to New York when she was pregnant and gave birth to the boy there, but the Millers argue she moved to be in a more favorable state for the custody case

She has posted photos of she and 'Sam' together in New York over the past few days, including one of the pair attending the Thanksgiving Day parade.

Even though he didn't have his son near him to post new photos, Bode didn't let the social media war stay put there: he posted an old photo of 'Nate' and Dace, his 5-year-old daughter from another previous relationship.

He and Morgan had discussed online how they were celebrating an 'early' Christmas this week in Colorado, and the picture of 'Nate' and Dace read: 'She's super sad her brother isn't here to celebrate with us.'

McKenna has custody of 'Sam' until at least the next hearing on Monday December 9.
