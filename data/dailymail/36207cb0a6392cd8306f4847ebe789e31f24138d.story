A patriotic advert for a Welsh University, which features a Hollywood actor, has been criticsed after it was filmed in England.

The 96-second clip, which shows the Titanic star Ioan Gruffudd walking across a set of hills, had to be shot in the Mendip Hills in Somerset because it was raining in Wales.

The location of the video, commissioned by South Wales University, was changed to avoid 'typical weather', but a Welsh politician has said the decision to swap was 'odd'.

Weather: The advert is supposed to show him walking through the Brecon Beacons, but the location was changed to Somerset because of rain

Plaid Cymru Welsh Assembly Member Lindsay
Whittle said: 'It seems odd the university would choose a well-known 
Welsh actor to front their advertising campaign but made it in England.'

Speaking about the campaign, Gruffudd said, as a proud Welshman, that he was delighted to help and said 'what could be better' when the location of the advert was set for his native country.  

University chiefs commissioned an advertising agency based in Bristol to make the cinema commercial.

Instead of filming close to the 
university's Treforest campus near Pontypridd, the firm opted for the 
Mendips, where there was less risk of a showers.

A university spokesman said the decision was made to avoid 'typically Welsh rainy weather'.

They added: 'The ad has a very Welsh flavour with one of Wales's top stars and its message is universal, making people think about how their university choices affect the rest of their lives.

'We are pleased that thousands of people are continuing to watch the advert with overwhelmingly positive feedback for its powerful message.

'We'd encourage people to watch the video and judge for themselves.'

The video was part of a YouTube playlist on The University of South Wales' website homepage , but the link has now been deactivated

The University of South Wales was formed when the University of Glamorgan and the University of Wales, Newport, merged.

It is now one of the largest universities in the UK and is expected to welcome more than 30,000 students for the start of the academic year at the end of this month.

The university's website says it is 'offering more opportunities and better prospects for students.

'Students will benefit from the University’s growing reputation as a major university for jobs and employers.'

Ioan Gruffudd, 39, started his career in Welsh-language productions before moving into mainstream film and television.

He found fame when he played Commander Harold Lowe in the 1997 version of Titantic and Dr Reed Richards in the Fantastic Four films.
