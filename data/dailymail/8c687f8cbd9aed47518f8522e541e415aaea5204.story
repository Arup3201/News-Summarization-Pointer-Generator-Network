Arsene Wenger will no longer commentate for top France television channel TF1 after the Arsenal manager's contract was not renewed.

Le Parisien newspaper originally reported the 64-year-old was 'greatly surprised' that his contract would come to an end after more than 10 years of reporting on the France national team.

It seems, though, that the decision was made by 'joint agreement' between Wenger and TF1.

Wenger was absent from France's 1-0 win over Spain at the Stade de France on Thursday, where Chelsea's new striker Loic Remy scored the game's only goal 17 minutes from time.

The Arsenal boss covered France at the World Cup in Brazil for TF1 and has covered Champions League football for the French channel in previous years.

It will allow Wenger more time to concentrate on Arsenal's Premier League efforts as the Gunners, currently having won one match and drawn two, chase trophies to add to last year's FA Cup win.
