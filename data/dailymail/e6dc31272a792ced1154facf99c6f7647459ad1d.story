A U.S. congressman calling for the release of classified material from a report into 9/11 has warned there would be 'anger, frustration, and embarrassment' if the redacted pages were made public. 

Representative Thomas Massie has joined a call for the government to declassify 28 pages redacted from the Joint Inquiry into Intelligence Community Activities Before and After the Terrorist Attacks of September 11, 2001.

Earlier this year, the lawmaker described how he had to 'try to rearrange my understanding of history' after he read the classified pages of the joint investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees.

Speaking on Wednesday to The Glenn Beck Program on The Blaze TV, Massie said it was important the American public are able to read the report, although he warned there will be 'anger, frustration, and embarrassment when these 28 pages finally come out.'

Massie has backed a House Resolution, introduced in December last year by representatives Walter Jones and Stephen Lynch, calling upon President Barack Obama to declassify the redacted pages.

At a press conference earlier this month, Massie explained how he felt after reading the report.

He said: 'I had to stop every couple of pages and just sort of absorb and try to rearrange my understanding of history for the past 13 years and the years leading up to that.

'It challenges you to rethink everything and so I think the whole country needs to go through that.

'It's going to be difficult and it could be embarrassing, but that is no reason to keep the truth from the American people.'

Rep Warren Jones, Rep Stephen Lynch and family members of 9/11 victims filed a resolution last December calling for the Obama administration to declassify the 28 pages of the report

Massie called on all congressmen able to read the report to do so and  co-sponsor the bill put forward last year by Congressman Jones, Congressman Lynch and family members of 9/11 victims. 

The resolution calls for the Obama administration to declassify the pages of the report, which was released in 2002.

In a statement, Lynch said he had been given the opportunity to look at the classified material and believed the information should be made public, the Associated Press reported.

He said the redacted pages 'contain information that is vital to a full understanding of the events and circumstances surrounding this tragedy'.
