Steel: Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured leaving Number 10 this week, urged the Tory party not to buckle

Theresa May has cast herself as the Tories’ new Iron Lady, telling colleagues pushing through unpopular spending cuts and reforms: ‘Whatever you do, don’t buckle.’

In another speech ranging far beyond her Home Office brief, the most senior woman in the Government insisted it was possible to do ‘more for less’ across the public sector – highlighting welfare, defence and local government.

Mrs May also suggested the Government had to do more to stand up to vested interests in the private sector – particularly banks and big utilities.

‘Big, unaccountable businesses that manipulate markets or abuse their monopoly positions should also be in our sights.

'Whether it’s the banking sector, where customers find it difficult to switch companies, or the big utility firms, with their opaque pricing plans, or the oil industry, which stands accused of price fixing by whistleblowers, we should be as tough with the private sector as we are with the public sector,’ the Home Secretary said.

In a speech to the centre-Right think tank Reform, Mrs May, who has been careful not to stray from her brief since speculation about her leadership ambitions erupted earlier this year, sketched out a broad platform for a Tory victory in 2015.

The steely Home Secretary, hailed as ‘Britain’s Angela Merkel’ by her allies, said the Conservatives’ mission went far beyond the elimination of the vast budget deficit left behind by Labour.

She pointed out that her party had questioned the level of Labour’s public spending as long ago as the 2001 election campaign but ‘sadly our argument fell on deaf ears, and we all know what came next’.

A senior Tory minister today fuelled speculation that Theresa May is positioning herself as a future party leader.

In the Commons Labour MP John Spellar (Warley) said Mrs May could benefit from persuading police forces to buy more British vehicles, as he urged Government departments to back the country's car industry.

Mr Spellar: 'Will you talk to the Home Secretary and get her to back British industry? It might even help her leadership ambitions.'

Mr Fallon prompted cheers from the Commons as he replied: 'They may not need that much help.'

‘High taxes, a structural deficit, 
unreformed public services and an unbalanced economy meant that when the
crash came, Britain wasn’t ready,’ she added.

Mrs
May said there was ‘no other way’ than fundamental reform of the public
sector and pointed to her own success in reducing crime, while slashing
budgets.

‘When we said we 
would cut central government police budgets by twenty per cent in real 
terms over four years, the critics – not just the Labour Party, but 
ACPO, the Police Federation and many academics – were united. Frontline 
policing would be decimated and crime would go up.

'But in fact, the opposite happened – crime is down by more than ten per cent since the election,’ she said.

‘That crime is down is thanks to the efforts of thousands of officers up and down the country and the leadership of chief constables, but it’s also down to police reform.

Mrs May pointed to measures to make 
police more accountable via beat meetings, crime maps and elected 
commissioners, and the abolition of national targets and the 
introduction of greater flexibility in police employment.

‘We’re delivering more with less,’ she insisted.

The
Home Secretary said the Tories had to ‘make sure that the debate in 
this country never returns to the false choice of more spending or worse
services’.

She went on: 
'We have to reassure people about our motives and our values. We have to
show them that we’re committed to universal public services and we must
never appear to be doctrinaire about what we’re doing.

'We
have to be clear that we’re reducing spending on public services not 
because we care little for them, but because we have to for the sake of 
our economy.'

Urging Cabinet colleagues not to waver in the teeth of opposition to reforms, she said: ‘Difficult decisions often mean upsetting people – especially when the change involves pay and conditions. But that doesn’t mean you can shirk them.

‘You have to decide what is in the national interest and do it. Keep making your case, always remind people of what you’re trying to achieve, what’s the end objective, but whatever you do, don’t buckle.’

Mrs May would not countenance any sort of leadership challenge to David Cameron, and has repeatedly stressed her loyalty to him.

However, she is understood to regard Boris Johnson as ‘faintly ridiculous’ and is determined to prevent him becoming leader in the event of the Tories losing the next election.
