With just three bakers left in the running, things are hotting up ahead of the Great British Bake Off final tomorrow night.

But while Richard, Luis and Nancy are biting their nails, supermarkets are already celebrating thanks to soaring sales of baking ingredients.

According to Waitrose, sales of edible glitter and mini marshmallows have doubled since the series began, while last week's patisserie theme boosted baklava sales by 100 per cent.

Sales have even remained buoyant in the face of the controversies that have dogged this year's Bake Off, including accusations of smut and the infamous 'Alaskagate' incident.

'It’s always great to see a TV programme inspiring shoppers to don their aprons and get cooking, and this effect is no more apparent than with the Great British Bake Off,' said a spokesman for Waitrose.

'Now in its fifth series, the programme’s effect on sales shows no signs of abating with this year’s challenges prompting customers to create all manner of baked treats.'

But it's not only the supermarkets who are seeing the benefits as a result of Great British Bake Off's popularity.

Bookmakers too are doing a roaring trade as punters rush to place bets on their favourite finalist, with builder Richard Burr currently leading the field according to Ladbrokes.

Tasty: According to Waitrose, sales of baklava have shot up by an impressive 100 per cent in a week

Delighted: Judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood were delighted with Burr's heart-shaped doughnuts

Last week saw Burr leave judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood delighted, as he presented a series of perfect teatime treats, including heart-shaped doughnuts and a Swedish tea ring.

But not far behind him is Stockport's Luis Troyano with odds of 2/1, while the last finalist, Nancy Birtwhistle, is hot on their heels on 3/1.

'It will be the biggest upset since David beat Goliath if Richard isn't crowned as Bake Off winner,' said Ladbrokes' Jessica Bridge.

'He's had Paul and Mary eating out of his hands every week and we cannot see success for Luis or Nancy.'

She added: 'All three of this year's finalists are loved by Bake Off fans which has no doubt helped ratings rocket, along with the smutty innuendos.' 

Despite the smut, Burr, the indisputable star of this series, has proved considerably less controversial than last year's favourite Ruby Tandoh, who set Twitter ablaze as the final approached.

Although she lost the final, she has since gone on to create a recipe book of her own which has also proved controversial, thanks to pops at Berry and Hollywood.

Nevertheless, supermarkets will be hoping Burr follows in Tandoh's footsteps - in publishing, if not controversies - and helping to keep Britain's passion for baking alive in the process.

'At the beginning of the series, we saw a rise in sales of cake decorations and toppings that appeal to the nation's upcoming baking stars with mini marshmallows up 110 per cent, glitter strands up 124 per cent, pink and white sugar stars up 95 per cent, fruity confetti up 79 per cent and glacé cherries up 17 per cent,' added the Waitrose spokesman.

'Shoppers also started to stock up their cupboards with essentials in preparation for the weeks ahead, with sales of spelt flour up 103 per cent, lemon juice up 14 per cent and sandwich tins up 21 per cent.

'As the weeks go by, the bakes get harder but this hasn’t stopped our customers giving the various challenges a go in their own home.

'For example, during Baked Alaska week, we  saw a 129 per cent rise in sales of our Seriously Madagascan Vanilla ice cream and a 29 per cent rise in vanilla extract sales. 

'Whatever the age or experience, it seems the nation is still dough-eyed for all things Bake Off!'
