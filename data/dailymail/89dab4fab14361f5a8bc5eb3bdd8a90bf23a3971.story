Controversial: Michelle Beer (pictured), who appeared on television show Too Fat To Work

Family doctors could be offered bonuses for weighing thousands of patients under NHS proposals to tackle obesity.

They would be given financial incentives for recording the weight of anyone with an underlying health problem triggered by being overweight.

Based on existing incentives, the payments could range from £1,500 to £15,000 a year per GP surgery depending on how effective they are deemed at helping the NHS.

The plans have been drawn up by health watchdog NICE in the hope of ultimately saving the NHS billions of pounds by treating complications caused by obesity. The news of the proposals comes amid increasing controversy over the cost of obesity to the state.

This month Channel 5 documentary, Benefits: Too Fat To Work featured couple Michelle and Stephen Beer, who say their weight prevents them from working. Between them they weigh 54 stone and receive around £1,700 a month in benefits.

A quarter of adults in Britain are considered obese and our rates are the second highest in Europe, only surpassed by Hungary.

Although there are no accurate estimates of the cost of obesity to the NHS, it spends £10billion annually treating Type 2 diabetes alone.

But senior doctors said the proposals were just a ‘box-ticking’ exercise which would just overburden GPs with more paperwork without actually benefiting patients.

In October last year, similar plans to pay GPs a £55 bonus for each dementia diagnosis in a bid to boost detection were condemned as an ‘ethical travesty’.

The obesity payments would form part of a bonus scheme called the Quality and Outcomes Framework, or QOF, whereby extra cash is given to surgeries for treating illnesses such as heart disease and depression.

GPs would be urged to record the body mass index (BMI) once a year of anyone with high blood pressure, asthma, heart disease, arthritis or who has previously had a stroke or heart attack, which are commonly triggered by obesity.

The BMI is the measurement of a person’s weight in relation to their height and a reading of 25 or above is considered overweight while 30 or higher is obese.

NICE stressed that the proposals are still in the very early stages and would now be considered as part of a month-long consultation, along with incentives for other conditions.

If approved, they would be passed on to officials at NHS England who would negotiate with senior doctors at the British Medical Association on how much the incentives should be worth and what targets should be met to earn them.

But based on existing incentives, they could range from £1,500 a year up to £15,000 a year depending on how effective they are deemed to be at tackling obesity.

The payments would then be offered from next year – although they would go to surgeries, rather than to GPs directly.

A spokesman for British Medical Association said: ‘We would need to see the details of the proposals and ensure that they have real clinical value, rather than being a box ticking exercise that place yet another pointless administrative burden on overstretched GP services.’

But GP David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said the plans didn’t go far enough, as GPs should be focusing on weighing patients who don’t yet have a health problem – so it could be prevented.

He said: ‘It’s all in the wrong direction. It’s people without a diagnosis for one of these conditions who need to be screened.’

The QOF consists of targets covering a range of conditions including heart disease, dementia and cancer.

A maximum of 1,000 points is available for every practice per year, and each point is worth £157.

But experts have warned it has offered limited benefit to patients as it encourages doctors to focus on conditions which merit payments.
