A Harvard recent-grad and her mother were killed last weekend in a car accident with an off-duty state trooper who was three times over the legal drinking limit.

64-year-old Susan Macchi and her 23-year-old daughter Juliet were on their way home from a Boston Red Sox game when their Dodge Neon collided with off-duty state trooper John Bassler's Toyota Corolla.

While police initially said there was no signs of alcohol consumption at the crash scene, the story changed Friday when 25-year-old Basler was charged with operating under the influence and negligent operation of a motor vehicle.

There were no witnesses to the head-on crash that happened after midnight on Federal Furnace Road.

Two drivers pulled up to the crash at 12:29am and found the mother and daughter trapped in their vehicle.

They found Basler outside of his car, lying on the side of the road with hip and pelvic injuries.

Emergency responders ruled Mrs Macchi dead on the scene and rushed her daughter to Jordan Hospital where she was later pronounced dead.

Basler was taken to South Shore Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

Basler was off-duty at the time of the crash, and had allegedly been drinking before driving. 

A source told WBZ that Basler had a blood-alcohol level of .26 after the crash, which is three times the legal limit.

In
addition to the OUI and negligent driving charges, he will also be 
charged with carrying a firearm while under the influence.

Charged: Initial police reports said there was no sign of alcohol consumption at the scene but that changed Friday when Basler was charged with OUI and negligent operation of a motor vehicle

Tragic loss: Mrs Macchi was pronounced dead at the scene. Her daughter was rushed to a local hospital but was later pronounced dead as well

Basler had recently become a state trooper in March 2012, but in light of the charges has been put on leave.

Juliet Macchi graduated in 2012 from Harvard and had been working as a shift manager at a Dunkin Donuts in her hometown of Carver, Massachussetts.

She and her mother were planning an upcoming move to California together so that Juliet could work as a grip on a film set.

Even more tragic was the fact that Ms Macchi was a drug and alcohol peer advisor during her time at Harvard.

Risk-taker: Friends of Juliet said she went sky-diving almost every weekend. Above, she's pictured in skydiving gear with her mom

Two students at the school confirmed to MailOnline that she served as a campus leader who educated peers on alcohol and drug issues.

One of her other big passions was sky-diving, and she jumped out from planes almost every weekend.

Ms Macchi gave a speech at her dorm, Lowell House, before graduating in which she explained why she enjoyed sky-diving so much.

'I
want a chance to be swept along by events beyond my control,' she said.
'To stop worrying about what was the right or the smart thing to do, 
and give myself a chance to breathe, to get to know more the person I've
become.'

Some of Macchi's peers have described her in an obituary published by the Harvard Crimson.

'She
was loyal and dedicated to the causes she chose and people she loved 
with a formidable tenacicty,' whote Macchi's roommate of three years, 
Marina Connelly. 'I will always love her.'

The mother and daughter are survived by Macchi's father and her three older brothers: Matt, Mike and Richard.
