A pup Rottweiler is fighting for her life today after being thrown from a moving car in New York, as police try to find the callous people capable of doing such a thing.

The six-month-old suffered serious head trauma and hypothermia after being left in freezing temperatures on the side of the road in Queens.

She was wrapped in a sleeping and hurled out the window of the car around the intersection of Cypress Avenue and Vermont Place, next to the Jackie Robinson Parkway in Glendale, about 10.30 pm Thursday.

Fortunately two passers-by saw the awful incident unfold and rescued the poor puppy, according to The Daily News.

Awful: This Rottweiler survived being stuffed into a bag and thrown from a moving car in Queens on Thursday night, but is now fighting for her life

Head trauma: The dog suffered serious injuries and hypothermia 

The witnesses then flagged down a fire truck.

'We were on a run for a car accident and got waved down by two witnesses,' firefighter William Aaron, 44,

'They thought they saw something come out of a car.'

The dog was badly injured, cold and confused.

She was conscious though.

'She was shivering and shaking,' Aaron said.

'She was awake and not really alert.'

She was transported to BluePearl Veterinary Partners in Forest Hills.

The nurses at the clinic have named her Dasher.

Help: Nurses at BluePearl Veterinary Partners in Forest Hills are now caring for her and have called her Dasher

They found an unknown mass in her stomach.

It is not known if Dasher will survive.

If she does, Aaron has offered to adopt her.

Police have confirmed they are investigating and are trying to get information on the car Dasher was thrown from.

Anyone interested in donating to Dasher’s care can call BluePearl Veterinary Partners at (718) 263-0099.
