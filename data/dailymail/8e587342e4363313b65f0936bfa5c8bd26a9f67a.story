An enormous Cold War-era bomber which first flew in 1962 has been resurrected from the Air Force's scrap heap to serve the nation once more.

The B-52, nicknamed Ghost Rider, was mothballed seven years ago at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona - the so-called boneyard where decommissioned planes are kept in storage.

It took to the skies once more on February 13 after months of painstaking restoration, which saw damaged parts such as the fuel lines and hydraulic steering systems replaced to make her airworthy once more.

Airborne once more: This B-52 bomber, nicknamed Ghost Rider, took to the skies earlier this month after spending seven years mothballed in Arizona

Ready to fly: The long-range attack plane, which first entered service in 1962, was painstakingly restored to airworthiness at the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tucson, Arizona

Bolted back together: The powerful jet, which can deliver nuclear and conventional munitions almost anywhere on earth, needed extensive replacements, but managed a 1,000-mile test flight without problems

The hot, dry conditions in the desert mostly helps preserve the aircraft, but also had the effect of bleaching Ghost Rider's grey hull to an almost white white. 

She was flown from Tucson to another base in Shreveport, Louisiana, where it will be tested and receive further repairs before rejoining the fleet.

When fully functional, Ghost Rider will be capable of unleashing 70,000lbs of weapons, conventional or nuclear, almost anywhere on the planet.

The plane, which will be one of 76 kept flying the the Air Force, has a range of 8,000 miles on one fuel tank, and can travel 650mph at altitudes as high as 50,000ft.

Easy does it: The flight, to Shreveport, Louisiana, was taken on at lower speeds and altitudes than usual for safety reasons

At the helm: Colonel Keith Schulz's, the Air Force's most experienced serving B-52 pilot, flew Ghost Rider on February 13

However, for its first flight since being decommissioned in 2008, Ghost Rider was limited to 288mph and did not rise above 23,000ft. It also kept its landing gear down the whole way.

Air Force chiefs say they waited until after the flight had ended to announce it due to safety concerns.

In a published report on the restoration, Colonel Keith Schultz, who piloted Ghost Rider, said: 'I've been flying the B-52s since the 80s and it surprised me that after almost seven years...she cranked up just fine and we had no issues with the flight control systems.

Bleached: The hot Arizona weather, which mostly helps preserve the planes, also bleached parts of the B-52 almost white

Back in the fold: When fully restored, Ghost Rider will be one of 76 B-52s which the Air Force keeps active. The planes have been in service since the 1950s

'It took a little under three hours for the flight and we were fortunate to have had good weather the entire trip as the inertial and navigational equipment had not been installed.'

The flight was the first time a B-52 has been brought back to duty after being retired.

Ghost Rider was needed once more to replace a B-52 which caught fire and was left with a burned-out cockpit, according to the Shreveport Times.

The plane was so badly damaged that Air Force engineers decided it would be cheaper to bring back an old plane than try to fix that one.
