With Sunday’s New York City Marathon cancelled among concerns it would drain valuable resources after Hurricane Sandy, some ‘disenfranchised’ marathoners have vowed to run the route anyway.

David McNally, who has lived most of his life in Staten Island, is organizing an unofficial shadow marathon with his friends and they’re looking for company.

‘My friends and I are still planning to run the course, starting in Bay Ridge and we are recruiting people!’ McNallly said.

Cancelled: The New York City Marathon was cancelled amid criticism it would drain valuable resources from hurricane recovery and insult residents who'd lost homes and loved ones

He’s also started a Facebook page to rescue the marathon, inviting others to take to the course with him on Sunday, Gothamist reported.

‘For those of who are disenfranchised from running this Sundays NYC Marathon, come join me to run the course this Sunday. It takes a lot to train for such a feat and to come so far to run the worlds most popular marathon shouldn't draw anger or diversion, but unity and respect for the greatest city in the world,’ he wrote.

‘Ive lived on Staten island for the greater part of my life and i believe by running this marathon it would raise money and draw admiration for the resiliency of the greatest city in the world.

Undaunted: David McNally insists the race should go on for 'disenfranchised' runners and plans to run the original New York City Marathon route around Central Park

'Even though it is canceled we should
run it anyway for our selves, but most of all for all those that we 
have lost during this week.

'The
show must go on. All those who are with me join me tomorrow in Bay Ridge
to volunteer and run Sunday to raise whatever we can in spite of the 
cancellation.’

After some 
consideration the group has decided to do the original 1970 course route
which consists of approximately 4 laps around Central Park rather than 
attempt Sunday’s scheduled route for logistical reasons as the city is 
still repairing itself.

Despite criticism, the mock-marathoners say the race will be proof of New York's resiliency

So far 77 people have joined McNally’s Facebook group for the proposed run.

McNally’s project was met with some criticism from people who felt the marathon was insulting to people who’s homes have been destroyed or lost loved ones.

‘Instead of running past neighborhoods where people’s homes once stood in a display of defiance, how about you volunteer and make your trip to NYC worth something bigger than your pride,’ William F Hattar wrote on the Facebook group’s wall.

But runners insist the mock-marathon will be a display of New York’s resilience.

‘If it were a baseball game, no one would challenge the idea of letting the show go on,’ Renia Ellen Saddler wrote on the page. ‘This isn’t about ego; this is a reminder that humans are strong and brilliant, and we will not go gentle into that good night.
