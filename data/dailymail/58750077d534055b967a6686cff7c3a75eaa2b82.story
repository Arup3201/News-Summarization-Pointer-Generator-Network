Martin Atkinson did all he could to allow the Merseyside derby to develop into a good physical battle and keep 22 players on the park.

Gareth Barry perhaps benefited most from Atkinson’s approach with a series of fouls, any number of which could have been cautioned but only one was.

In such a game when so much happens the referee will always miss some incidents and both teams should have had penalty kicks.

Everton first when Alberto Moreno pulled Romelu Lukaku to the ground and Liverpool following a clear hand ball from Barry.

Atkinson was completely blameless in missing the first as he was unsighted and could have been helped by his assistant but had a good view himself of the Barry handball but somehow decided it was accidental.

Overall I thought Atkinson’s approach helped the game and made it a more enjoyable spectacle. The fact that the missed penalties balanced each other out meant he had no adverse effect on the result.
