Darren Scott's victim became intimidated and scared by his moody behaviour and wide-eyed stare

A fantasist who slashed his wealthy friend repeatedly in the neck in a savage attack at the victim's luxury apartment is facing jail today.

Psychology graduate Darren Scott, 26, launched the frenzied knife attack after cooking up a plan to con money out of his rich pal.

He stabbed his victim three times in the neck and repeatedly on his body with a serrated kitchen knife in the master bedroom of the £2million home in Mayfair, central London.

Scott screamed ‘stand still I need to finish the job’ as he tried to tear open the neck wounds with his fingers while angry rap music blared in the background.

An Old Bailey jury today convicted him of attempted murder, fraud and possession of an article for use in fraud, at the end of a three-week trial.

During the horrific incident, the court heard, the victim, a writer who cannot be identified for legal reasons, fought back and managed to barricade himself in the en-suite bathroom while blood gushed from his throat.

Undeterred, Scott tried to kick the door down to continue the attack, chillingly telling the man ‘you’re going to die’ before eventually fleeing the blood-soaked apartment.

He had conned his way into the victims’ home just a day after they had met through social media, posing as an investment consultant for Procter and Gamble and pretending he had been kicked out of his own flat.

Initially intrigued by Scott’s wide-eyed stare and moody demeanour, the victim soon became ‘intimidated’ and scared by his erratic behaviour.

Scott, whose adopted parents live in Immingham, near Grimsby, had confessed to enjoying kinky bondage games with handcuffs and rope that he carried around with him.

The victim had resolved to kick Scott out of the apartment the night before the attack, after seeing him angrily chopping potatoes.

But Scott launched the terrifying knife attack while giving the victim a friendly massage in the bedroom the next morning.

He broke down in tears and sobbed into his hands as the verdicts were read out in court today.

Scott will be sentenced at Cambridge Crown Court next month.

Scott, who has a first-class honours degree in psychology from the University of Hull, launched the bloody assault on July 3 last year, less than two weeks after he and the victim had first met.

When he was arrested at a jazz club in Hull the following day, police discovered Scott had taken thousands of photos in the time he had been living in the Mayfair apartment.

Text messages show he had been passing the luxury pad off as his own to pals, boasting about his ‘insane’ penthouse in Mayfair with a fully-stocked wine cellar.

He had been on spending sprees with his victim’s credit card, including £1,700 at House of Fraser and a first-class train ticket to Hull.

Scott had also sketched plans of the apartment, photographed the digital entry keypad on the front door, and researched online how to disable the alarms.

Among his possessions was a bogus court compensation order for £420,000, forged bank statements, and a fake job offer from Procter and Gamble.

Prosecutor John Clifford said the bedroom of the apartment was left ‘like something out of a horror movie’ after Scott’s attack.

The victim, coming face to face with Scott for the first time since the attack, gave detailed evidence about how a ‘possessed’ Scott tried to kill him.

He said Scott massaged him for around 40 minutes with soothing music playing on his iPhone, before going to the kitchen to get some salt water.

When he returned, Scott told him to roll on to his back and he lay a rolled up vest over his eyes.

‘The music had turned to rap music’, he told jurors. ‘A certain kind of rap music that I was not familiar with.’

Scott then plunged the kitchen knife into his neck, stabbed him repeatedly during a violent struggle in the bedroom.

‘I was sure that I had been murdered and I had a very short time to live’, he said.

‘The only thought I had in my mind was why I had been so patient, and that I had a gut feeling - an uncomfortable gut feeling - and I had been too patient.

‘I was now dying because I had been murdered, these are the last minutes of my life and this is how my life has come to an end.’

He continued: ‘Darren was like a possessed, vicious man who was staring in my eyes, telling me: “What did you think this was all about - stand still I need to finish the job”’, he said.

‘When Darren first moved to strike, I think he made a sound.

‘I can’t remember if these sounds are in my head or I heard them.

‘Darren was using his left hand, trying to put his fingers into my neck wounds and rip them open them with his hand as he was striking with the other one and I was shouting “murder”.’

The victim said he resorted to grabbing the blade of the knife to stop the attack, and managed to struggle free and lock himself in the bathroom.

He said Scott had tapped his neck ‘like a nurse looking for a vein’ just moments before the stabbing, then pinned his arms to the bed.

‘In a flash, Darren’s body moved and as soon as his body moved I turned myself away from Darren’s right’, he said.

‘I managed to throw Darren off my body and the next thing I remember I was fighting off the knife in the middle of the room.

‘Darren stabbed me repeatedly around the same area of my neck.

‘I fought with my arms and kept Darren off me.’

He said Scott had earlier confessed to tying up a previous partner with rope and handcuffs during massages.

‘He said he used to tie them up with a rope which had handcuffs at the end’, he said.

‘The rope would go under the bed and come up the other side and tie the wrists.

‘He said he would massage his partner and then have sex with them.’

But he told jurors: ‘I’ve never been interested in activities like that’.

Scott broke down crying after the attack, then fled, taking a train to Brough near Hull that evening.

Bearing visible injuries, Scott told pals he had been the victim of an attack by potential investors who were trying to steal his art work.

But when snared the next day while socialising at Jaz Cafe Bar in Lowgate, Hull, Scott’s web of lies was unravelled.

He told his victim that he had been abused as a child and stabbed by his birth mother, had worked overseas in Iraq, and claimed his father was a wealthy North Sea oil worker.

Scott, of no fixed address, denied attempted murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, fraud and possession of an article for use in fraud.
