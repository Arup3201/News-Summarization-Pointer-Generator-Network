Australia's newest wildlife warrior is about to show the world how to dig out the most dangerous reptiles from backyards, beds and household bathrooms.

Former pastry chef Julia Baker, 45, is about to morph into Snake Sheila, a fearless snake charmer whose face-to-face encounters with Queensland's most dangerous reptiles will be documented in a new television series.

From encountering deadly eastern brown snakes inside children's bedrooms to removing them off roofs, the 10-part documentary series will follow her as she visits the homes of Brisbane residents to remove the unwanted slippery visitors.

The Snake Sheila will take on television screens from January 2016 when she documents her life as a reptile handler

Her love of snakes spawned out of a visit to Australia Zoo which became the impetus for a new career

The Queensland capital - home to some of the world's deadliest varieties of reptiles including eastern brown snakes, death adders, eastern tigers, and coastal taipans - will be the backdrop for the show set to air in 2016.

With cane toads, domestic pets and other feral animals on the menu, snakes are on the move and there's only so many people qualified to catch and release them. 

That's where Snake Sheila steps in. 

Better known as Julia  Baker - Snake Sheila  was born in Australia to European parents - and became a qualified reptile handler after years as a pastry chef.

She split from her husband six years ago and quit her job to spend time doing things that brought her happiness.

Armed with a long hook, a bag and appropriate clothing Ms Baker brings snakes from out of the dark and puts them back in to the wild

It was after a trip to Australia Zoo in Beerwah,Queensland where she began her new life.

'I just fell in love, I felt so differently to everyone else getting a photo with the snakes, they all walked away saying 'yuck! they feel so gross' but I found them to be so beautiful and misunderstood.'  

She now spends her days removing eastern brown snakes from underneath concrete slabs and climbing roofs to check drains and down piping.

But it's her fear of heights, and not the threat of being bitten, which has her most worried when she attends to unwanted visitors inside homes. 

'It's not the dangerous, venomous snakes i'm afraid of catching,' she said. 'It's climbing ladders and hopping on roofs to reef them out, particularly if you don't know what snake you're catching.' 

On one occasion she recalls coming face-to-face with a red belly black snake in shorts and thongs - a dress-code  advised against when tackling one of Australia's most dangerous animals.

During the adrenaline-pumping ordeal, she said she the home owners described a vastly different variety of snake to what she encountered.

'I was told it was just a green tree snake, which aren't venomous.'

'But when I arrived wearing just shorts and thongs, it was in fact a red belly black snake curled up in the corner of a room.' 

Filming for the show has begun and will be broadcast on Animal Planet in 2016

Apart from the actual handling of the animals themselves, the Snake Sheila series also hopes to educate people about misconceptions revolving around the reptile, in particular, that a 'good snake is a dead snake.'

'This is far from the truth,' Ms Baker said.

'A good snake is a respected snake and if Australia didn't have snakes, we would be inundated with rats.' 

'They'd bring a lot of diseases with them.' 'People have to understand that we really need snakes and that if the snake is properly respected, there's no need to be afraid of them.' 

Program producer Mandy Lake said unlike the main star - some of Snake Sheila's crew members are a little reluctant to get too close to the scaly animals. 

'While I'm very excited by the prospect of showcasing our fantastic characters and magnificent snakes to the world, I am completely and utterly snake phobic,' she said.

'You could say that the promo shoots we've had so far, particularly the one with the brown snake in the baby's bedroom, have been somewhat challenging for me and I am treating the upcoming shoots as aversion therapy.'

The program will air on Animal Planet across every region except Canada and the US when it starts in January 2016.

Julia Baker also discovered a love of motorcycles when her marriage broke down
