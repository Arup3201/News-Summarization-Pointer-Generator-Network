President Barack Obama made a rare 2014 campaign stop on Tuesday evening in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to rally the party faithful for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke.  

At a packed gymnasium, Obama held up Democrat Mary Burke as a skilled businesswoman who will fight for the type of middle-class opportunity that made his own success possible.

Riffing on health care, the minimum wage and women's issues, Obama steered clear of referring directly to the state's Republican governor, Scott Walker, instead lumping him together with a Republican Party he accused of pushing antiquated and failed policies - such as opposition to fair pay legislation backed by Democrats.

But even an appearance by the president wasn't enough to keep some of Burke's supporters at the rally engaged - midway through Obama's remarks, attendees began to trickle out.

Even the setting for Obama's rally - a high school in a mostly black part of Milwaukee - served as a reminder of how limited Obama's appeal has become, both in geography and demographics

'Some people --not a lot, but some -- are leaving as the President is speaking,' FOX6 reporter Mike Lowe tweeted.

A video taken in the overflow room of the event, held at North Division High School, also shows a stream of attendees heading for the exits. 

This is the second time this month Obama's had this happen at a campaign rally. Attendees of an event for Maryland's Democratic gubernatorial candidate Anthony Brown also walked out on Obama, showing just how far the president's standing has fallen since he won reelection in 2012. 

Democrats hope Obama's appearance with Burke will help put her over the top in next week's tight race, while Republicans confidently predict Obama will have just the opposite effect.  

Defeating Walker, a potential 2016 presidential contender and nemesis of labor unions, would be a major coup for Democrats that could help boost the party's morale in a rocky political season. 

Democrats are still bruised from a failed 2012 effort to recall Walker. 

This year, polls show the race deadlocked between Walker and Burke, with very few voters undecided.

'The eyes of the country are on us,' Burke said as she introduced the president.

Obama has been a rare sight on the campaign trail this year - he made his first appearances just over a week ago - in large part due to low approval ratings that make him a potential liability for Democrats.

Even the setting for Obama's rally - a high school in a mostly black part of Milwaukee - served as a reminder of how limited Obama's appeal has become, both in geography and demographics.

Only seven voters in the ward where Obama held his rally voted for someone other than Obama in 2012, records show.

Still, the White House hopes Obama can help turn out high numbers of voters who backed his own presidential campaigns - chief among them African-Americans, Hispanics, young people and women.

'The country as a whole is doing better. Wisconsin's not doing so good,' Obama said. 

'Over the next week, you have a chance to change that. You have a chance to choose a governor who doesn't put political ideology first.'

Speaking about the economy, Obama said that unlike Walker, 'Mary Burke doesn’t believe that the minimum wage "serves no purpose," ' he said.

'It don't make no sense!' an audience member shouted in reference to Walker's position on the issue.

'It don't make no sense,' Obama replied, according to Bloomberg. 

'It don't make no sense,' the president said.

'We need to strengthen the middle class for the 21st century. That means we need leaders from the 21st century who actually believe women should get paid the same as men,' Obama said to cheers and laughter.

The rally before 3,500 people, including former 'West Wing' actor Bradley Whitford, opened a week of last-minute campaigning by Obama. 

He plans to travel to Michigan, Maine, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Pennsylvania - all states where Democrats are optimistic about the governor's races, in contrast to the party's gloomy expectations for the Senate.

But even in Wisconsin, Obama's ability to fire up Democrats without driving up GOP turnout is in question. 

Joe Fadness, head of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, said Obama's appearance with Burke would remind voters that Obama's economic policies are on the ballot on Election Day.

'Wisconsin can't afford a governor who will walk lock-step with President Obama and his failed policies that have hurt our country and would take Wisconsin backward,' Fadness said.

Before arriving at the rally, Obama headed to a chic downtown sushi joint, where he met privately with about 25 donors who gave $16,200 and up to the Democratic National Committee.
