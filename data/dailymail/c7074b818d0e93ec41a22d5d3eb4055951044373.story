Arsene Wenger backed striker Olivier Giroud to bounce back from his nightmare performance against Monaco with the Arsenal manager saying the French striker will not dwell on his horror show.

The Gunners suffered a 3-1 first leg defeat at home in their Champions League last 16 encounter on Wednesday - a damaging result that means they will have to score at least three goals in the French principality on March 17 if they are to have any chance of reaching the quarter-finals.

Giroud was guilty of missing two clear-cut chances for the north London outfit against Monaco, but Wenger insists the blame for the defeat should rest solely upon the 28-year-old's shoulders.

Speaking at the club's press conference on Friday, he said: ‘I hope not. He’s a strong character, Olivier, and personally I don’t blame him at all. We lost as a team. We fight for each other as a team. He worked hard for the team. He didn’t miss the chances on purpose. He wanted to score but it can happen.

‘He’s like everyone else - disappointed. There’s no one to blame individually. Which striker doesn’t miss chances? He has his chances and missed them. On the night everything went against us. Missing some chances was only one of the characteristics of the night. 

‘What is important now is to respond well. We are on a strong run in the Premier League. We have to respond to that disappointment. I expect a strong response because it’s a different competition and we have an opportunity to stabilise our position in the top three. We want to take it.'

The Arsenal boss is still adamant they could still come back from their 3-1 deficit to Monaco. 

‘We are still in the competition, we have a difficult task but it’s still feasible,' he added. 'It looks a terrible week for English clubs in Europe. I don’t have any rational explanation for that. It’s just a shock that hits us. Is there any rationality behind that, I don’t know?

‘We have played over 180 games in the Champions League. We have fought very hard against Besiktas just to qualify. You could see Besiktas is a good team playing against Liverpool last [Thursday] night, so we won some important games.

'What is frustrating is that we have gone out in the last 16 in the last four years, but twice against the future winners of the competition. This time we are still not out. We are still in the Champions League - so don’t deal us out too quickly.

‘We have to live with the reaction and what is important is to give a strong response when we are a big club. We are a club who interest many people and that gives us a stronger responsibility and of course when you come out of a disappointing game like Wednesday night you don’t expect people to applaud. It’s absolutely normal we get criticised. What is hurting is the defeat, more than the criticism. I don’t say I’m immune to criticism. I love to win and when I don’t win I’m hurt of course.’ 

The 65-year-old also revealed he will make changes for this weekend's game against Everton. ‘I have not made any decision for Sunday’s game. We have to rotate a little bit because there is Sunday and Wednesday games. 

'There will certainly be some changes. Everton have gone through but the Europa League and Premier League are different competition but we know that our strengths at home will be vital to strengthen our position. We have an opportunity we want to take.’

And he urged the fans to maintain their backing, despite the boos of Wednesday night. ‘You’re not a fan for one game for a fan for the club and no matter how big your club is you play 55 games a year and you have disappointing moments but we are third in the league, we’re on strong run. We’re not playing not to go down. We want to finish the season in strong way.’

Wenger has also revealed that Jack Wilshere has had a fresh surgical procedure to relieve some irritation on his injured ankle, which means he will be out for an additional two weeks.

Wilshere, who was out for three months after damaging ankle ligaments against Manchester United in Novermber, only returned to the bench last weekend against Crystal Palace. But to support the ligaments in his recovery, doctors inserted tiny pins with studs in his ankle area – and these have now been removed.

Wenger said: ‘He has little surgery on the ankle, a minor procedure as the studs on his ankle were irritating him. It was planned to be done at the end do the season but because it was an irritation, it was done now.’

Aaron Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini have returned to normal training but are ‘not completely ready’ according to Wenger while Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Debuchy remain threeweeks away from returning to fitness.
