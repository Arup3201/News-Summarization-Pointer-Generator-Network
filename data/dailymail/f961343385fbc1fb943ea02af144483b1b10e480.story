Leicester City manager Nigel Pearson was all smiles as he shook hands with club owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha on Tuesday night. 

The duo were pictured giving each other a friendly greeting as they took their seats in the Emirates stands ahead of Leicester’s clash with Arsenal.

The pair share a smile and a word as they put last weekend's issues behind them on Tuesday night

It was Pearson’s first stadium appearance since a weekend from hell for the 51-year-old who held on to his job by the skin of his teeth before swerving an FA charge.

Few could imagine that Pearson would still be in charge after the 51-year-old manager appeared to grab the throat of McArthur during Crystal Palace’s 1-0 win at the King Power Stadium on Saturday.

Pearson laughed off his touchline scuffle with Palace's record signing McArthur, who almost joined Leicester when leaving Wigan last summer.

BBC Match of the Day host Gary Linekar said the incident between Pearson and McArthur was 'strange'

Pearson claimed after the defeat to Palace that he could ‘look after himself’, but Match of the Day host Gary Lineker hinted on Twitter that he had been sacked. 

Former Leicester legend Lineker hinted that Pearson had been sacked by one member of the Srivaddhanaprabha family on Sunday night before being reinstated by another.

But there was clearly no hard feelings on show on Tuesday as the duo watched Leicester take on Arsenal.

But at half-time Lineker again took to twitter to have a dig at Pearson as Leicester went in at the break 2-0 down.

He tweeted: 'Leicester are 2 down at Arsenal. Pearson needs to get a grip of his players at halftime.'

As he so often does Pearson made his way down to the touchline area to watch the second half of the match.

And he was rewarded for his presence as club record signing Andrej Kramaric gave the Foxes a glimmer of hope against Arsene Wenger's side.

The Croatian attacker, who cost Pearson £9.5million in January, found the bottom left hand corner of David Ospina's goal to give the relegation threatened Foxes a way back into the game.

All eyes were on Leicester manager Nigel Pearson last night after his rather controversial antics on the touchline against Crystal Palace on Saturday.

Could he keep his hands to himself at the Emirates Stadium? Or, at the very least, not throttle an opposition player's throat?

0-45mins - The Foxes boss started the clash in the comfort of the directors box, flanked by assistant manager Steve Walsh, leaving coach Craig Shakespeare to control the technical area. Despite the furore surrounding his confrontation with Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur and the subsequent speculation about his job, Pearson seemed in chirpy mood, greeting well wishers with smiles and hand shakes. His mood would have changed no doubt after watching an unmarked Laurent Koscielny give Arsenal the lead. He didn't emerge until first half injury time, by which time his side were 2-0 down. His first task was to have debrief with Shakespeare.

46-56mins - He did take his place on the bench at the start of the second half - and it took just 70 seconds for Pearson to rise to his feet to hold another conference with Shakespeare before sitting down, cross armed and cross legged again. His subdued demeanour continued well into the second period, though he did smack his hands together in anger after Matty James failed to control with a clear run at goal awaiting him.

59mins - Finally some sign of life as he strides to the touchline to console Matt Upson who is forced off with an injury. Two minutes later he's on his feet again, this time celebrating Andrej Kramaric's goal with clenched fists. He stays stood in his technical area in the aftermath - but with his hands firmly in his pocket. Better safe than sorry. It's not long before he finds his seat again, though.

77mins - A tad more movement from Pearson as he gives Leonardo Ulloa instructions before his introductions, his conversation with the striker is interrupted though as Kramaric storms through one-on-one with David Ospina. The forward is foiled by the Gunners keeper, prompting a theatric arm waving and jumping from Pearson, About as animated he's been so far.

82mins - Having spent most of the night sitting down, Pearson - like his players - can smell Arsenal blood as he stays on his feet, right on the edge of his technical area for the final minutes of the encounter. He gives David Nugent a quick pep talk before throwing the striker on in search of an equaliser. But his efforts to cajole Leicester players are in vain, though he waits to greet every single one of his players as they walk off before giving the visiting fans a wave. A final goodbye, perhaps?
