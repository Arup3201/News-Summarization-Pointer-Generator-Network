After scoring four crucial goals to help Brazil successfully negotiate a tricky group phase, it's little wonder Neymar is jumping for joy.

The poster boy of the 2014 World Cup has matched every expectation so far, playing without a care in the world and, in his own words, 'living the dream.'

And he certainly looked relaxed as he playfully leapfrogged team-mate Hulk in training on Wednesday before showing off his fine repertoire of ball skills.

Many thought the 22-year-old would crumble under the enormous burden of trying to deliver Brazil the World Cup on home turf.

But that couldn't have been further from reality as doubles against Croatia and Cameroon set up a mouth-watering Last 16 clash with South American rivals Chile.

'There is no pressure when you are living your dream,' Neymar said with a rare mix of bravado and humility.

'I'm doing what I've always wanted to do since I was a little kid. Today my dream is coming true, I'm playing the matches that I've always wanted to be playing.'

Neymar seems to be heading for a Golden Boot head-to-head with his Barcelona team-mate Lionel Messi. The Brazilian went clear with those two against Cameroon but Argentine Messi hauled him back in with a double on Wednesday night against Nigeria.

Before the tournament, Neymar said that the personal accolade did not concern him: 'I don't want to be the best player, I don't want to be the top scorer.

'All I want to do is to win the World Cup title. It's what I always dreamed about. It doesn't matter how it happens, I just want to win the title.'

But even though the accolade has drawn closer, he still sends out the same message: 'All I want to do is play football and help my teammates and my team.

'Not only by scoring goals, but also by doing everything possible to help Brazil win.'

Neymar is the leading scorer in the current Brazil squad with 35 goals in 52 matches, and he has already equalled Pele's feat of four in his first three World Cup matches back in 1958.

A tougher challenge awaits on Saturday night in Belo Horizonte when the hosts must overcome the free-spirited and uber-attacking Chileans to make the last eight.

This wonderful, goal-laden World Cup could be about to reach even higher levels.
