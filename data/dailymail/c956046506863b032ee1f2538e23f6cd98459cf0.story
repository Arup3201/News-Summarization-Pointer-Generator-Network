Chart-topping singer Lorde has thrown her support behind her fellow countryman, Joe Irvine, who is at the centre of New Zealand's The X Factor controversy that ended in two judges being fired from the reality show.

The 18-year-old songstress, who is originally from Auckland, sent Irvine cupcakes and a touching note after he was roasted by British singers Natalia Kills and Willy Moon following his rendition of Justin Timberlake's Cry Me A River on the show on Sunday.

When giving her feedback to The X Factor contestant, Kills accused Irvine of copying husband Moon's style.

Lorde is also from New Zealand and wrote: 'Just wanted to say: your individuality, positive energy and spirit are infectious!'

Her comments, along with her spouse's, caused a social media storm, with people calling for their sacking.

The network which airs the show, TV3, bowed to pressure and immediately fired the husband-and-wife duo.

Support for Irvine came from all over the world, including from British singer Ed Sheeran, as people took to the internet, accusing Kills of copying the likes of Madonna, Lady Gaga and Willy Wonka.

But Lorde took it one step further and sent the humbled Irvine a box of cupcakes which spelled out 'Keep Being Joe' and a handwritten letter.

'Just wanted to say: your individuality, positive energy and spirit are infectious!' the Royals singer wrote.

'I think you're doing on awesome job on the show so far.

But the tirade did not stop with Kills, her husband - Willy Moon - also dished out his own harsh criticisms 

'I’m a performer too and I wanted to say that no matter how many people make fun of me for how I dress, move and act, I’m being me – and that’s what’s important. Good luck and lots of love, Lorde.'

Irvine tweeted his appreciate of the gesture on his Twitter account, which now has more than 12,000 followers.

'Hey you are awsome [sic] I love ur music and wanna meet you thank u so much for the cupcakes xo,' he said.

It comes as users on Twitter point out Natalia Kills' own look is far from original.

They have pointed out the Bradford-born singer appears to have drawn inspiration from a range of different artists including Jessie J, Lady Gaga and even Johnny Depp for fashion tips of her own.

Kills launched into a tirade at Joe on the first of the live shows, saying: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to state the obvious, we have a doppelgänger in our midst.

'As an artist who respects creative integrity and intellectual property, I am disgusted at how much you've copied my husband.'

Natalia's comments seemed to be based around the fact Joe had his hair slicked back and was wearing a suit, a look favoured by her husband of ten months.

Yet users on Twitter soon posted pictures that showed how Natalia's own  hair and make-up bears a striking resemblance to styles worn by Lily Allen and Elizabeth Taylor.

Some of the the funnier comparisons include Johnny Depp in Charlie and The Chocolate Factory and Lord Farquaad from Shrek.

She's even been compared to astrologer Mystic Meg and Lady Gaga.

Twitter users were quick to comment on the fact that many of Kills' looks seem to have been influenced by other people, this hilarious example compares her to Johnny Depp in Charlie And The Chocolate Factory

Kills has also been accused of stealing looks from Lady Gaga, these two images show the two women rocking remarkably similar styles

In one picture comparison on Twitter, Natalia's bun, blunt fringe and cat eye make-up looks similar to a look worn by Lady Gaga.

While other shots showed pictures of Natalia posing with her hand over one eye which echoed one of Lady Gaga's own photo poses. 

Another black and white shot of Natalia sees her posing with fingers pointing at her temples, miming having a gun pointing to her head.

Singer MIA also posed the same way in a black and white photograph. 

But when asked about Natalia's look being similar to other celebrities' style, a spokesperson for her said: 'I have known and worked with Natalia for over 15 years - she speaks from her heart and says what's she's feeling.

'She's a very talented and passionate young lady. Natalia has always had her own style and many leading international designers are always sending her outfits.'

Another funny example compared Kills to Lord Farquaad, an animated character from the hit movie Shrek

But in her The X Factor attack last night, Kills - who was born Natalia Noemi Keery-Fisher - lambasted Irvine further,  saying: 'From the hair to the suit, do you not have any value for respect for originality?'

She added: ‘You're a laughing stock. It's cheesy, it's disgusting, I personally found it artistically atrocious.

'I am embarrassed to be sitting here in your presence having to even dignify you with an answer of my opinion.' 

Irvine, who was appearing on the first live episode looked visibly upset by her comments and at one point seemed to be fighting back the tears. 

Moon, from Wellington, who she married last May, added:  'To me it feels just a little bit cheap and absurd.

'It's like Norman Bates dressing up in his mother's clothing, it feels a little creepy and I feel like you are going to stitch someone's skin to your face and then kill everybody in the audience.'

This user joked that the cartoon character Dore The Explorer would be mad Kills had stolen her hairstyle 

There has been several posts which compare Kills to Lady Gaga, here the pair shares a similar hair style and sunglasses to the singer 

And Kills' outburst was not the first time she had raised eyebrows while filming The X Factor.

When she first joined the show she was criticised after one round of auditions in Auckland where she apparently swore and screamed at audience members, which included children.

At the time, a representative for the show confirmed the incident saying: 'During a long day of filming, The X Factor NZ judge Natalia Kills expressed frustration at the behaviour of some sections of the audience.

'Her words were not well chosen, and both Natalia and TV3 apologise for any offence caused.' 

Since being dropped from the talent show, Natalia  tweeted saying: 'I love you guys, thanks for your support & understanding my passionate opinions! You know what they say about me...' 

She added a link to her video for her song Problem which includes the chorus: 'That girl is a problem.'

This Twitter user joked that Madonna had called and wanted her hair back

But the controversial singer and songwriter who, despite working with Madonna and the DJ David Guetta, until last night was barely known in her home country.

Born in West Yorkshire, the grammar school girl travelled extensively with her parents between Jamaica, the UK and Spain.

She became a child actress aged nine and appeared in the BBC's All About Me, voiced Amy Franks in the Radio 4 soap The Archers and made appearances in Casualty, Doctors and Coronation Street. 

Her father experienced a spell in prison and at the age of 14 she left home and began pursuing a music career in earnest in 2003.

Kills said: 'I moved out when I was almost 15 and spent my whole teenage years with no money, fighting with my boyfriend, joining a cult and getting in trouble with the police.'

She has spoken about having suffered with depression and having been suicidal in her younger years.

And, when in 2013 she released her album Trouble she told Life and Times she wanted to use it to confess all the bad things she had ever done.

According to Kills these included: 'Stalking my ex-boyfriend, trying to set fire to the house with us both in it, getting taken away by the police, leaving home at 15, making out with strangers and running away to Paris.'

She told Digital Spy: 'I remember when I was 19, I loved my boyfriend who didn't love me back so much - disturbingly much - that every time he hurt me I just desperately wanted to jump off the highest bridge I could find, or walk into the fastest truck. 

'I was just completely out of control of my erratic feelings of love and passionate desperation.'

Yet Kills has admitted in the past that she feels remorse over her actions, telling Electrocutie Music that her album Trouble was inspired by her rocky life: 'You know what? I do have regrets. 

'The album is actually full of regret. There was a point where I left home and was trying to be a grown-up. I had an awful boyfriend who treated me badly. 

'I wound up in a religious cult that I was in for a few years. It kind of shaped my mind to be good and do the right thing. I felt like “doing good” went against my inner nature.'
