Iker Casillas and Sergio Ramos took time to relax ahead of Real Madrid's clash with Atletico on Saturday by enjoying Spain's second sporting love... basketball.

The Real team-mates watched Spain take on France in the quarter-finals of the World Cup on Wednesday night, with Casillas' girlfriend and TV presenter Sara Carbonero joining them.

Spain were stunned by the French in a 65-52 defeat in Madrid, pulling away away in a tense finale, with Boris Diaw leading the charge with 15 points and five rebounds.

AS believe Ramos may be filling in at right-back on Saturday for Real Madrid for the fourth derby in eight games, with Dani Carvajal injured.

NBA star and Spain centre Pau Gasol has doubts about his future with the national team, telling reporters after the game: 'You never know when it is your last game or your last tournament,' Gasol told reporters after the 65-52 loss.
