With an election ahead and the weight of expectation upon him, David Cameron needs all the support he can get ... and so did his knees yesterday.

Panting, the Prime Minister wore support bandages on both legs – and, observers noted, perhaps a little extra padding of the natural variety elsewhere on his body too – as he got a soaking during a race along a swollen icy stream in the Cotswolds.

Mr Cameron, 48, tackled the annual fund-raising competition, known as the Great Brook Run, close to his constituency home in Witney, Oxfordshire. 

With mud smeared on his face, David Cameron enjoyed a pint after crawling the icy water to get under a low bridge during the charity fun run

The Prime Minister wore knee pads to prevent a repeat of the cut he sustained in the Great Brook Run in Chadlington in 2012

With mud smeared on his face, Mr Cameron came close to losing his footing as he ran through the stream

The cross-country event is raced for half its mile length in the stream itself close to the village of Chadlington.

Perhaps it was just as well he took extra precautions yesterday as, face smeared with mud, he crawled under a bridge and stumbled through the water, almost losing his footing at one point.

But at least there was little danger of cuts – to Mr Cameron’s knees, that is, thanks to the extra layer protecting them. 

A Downing Street source said: ‘He took the precaution of using the knee supports this year for protection from sharp stones submerged in the water.’

The race is held every year in the Cotswold village during the Christmas break as a chance to run off the excess of the festive season

Every competitor gets a medal for taking part in the race, which has the slogan: ‘Run. Get Wet. Have a Pint’

The run’s safety manual warns: ‘The brook is cold, parts of it are up to 3ft deep. There are many hidden rocks and tree roots which can be a trip hazard.’

Despite looking a little breathless at times, Mr Cameron completed the course.

He finished 64th out of 141 runners, with a time of 14 minutes, 12 seconds, organiser Adam Engberg said last night from the Tite Inn in Chadlington, where many competitors recuperate after the run.

Mr Cameron was congratulated by his wife Samantha, who stayed warm and dry in a grey winter coat and scarf while watching the race, as he enjoyed a refreshing pint of beer. 

She was on hand for moral support after the race's conclusion, with spectators looking on

Mr Cameron lined up with other runners this morning, after taking part previously in 2012 and 2009

The Great Brook Run, which was first held in 2006, starts and ends at the Tite Inn in Chadlington and aims to raise funds for local good causes

The race, which raises money for the local primary school and costs £5 to enter, was first run in 2006. Organisers say that every runner ‘no matter how c**p’ gets a medal.

In 2008, the first year Mr Cameron competed, he finished 25th out of more than 100 competitors – and did not wear a support bandage on either knee. In 2009, his knees were unsupported too.

But at his next appearance in the event in 2012 he wore a support bandage on his right knee and finished 46th out of a field of 109 (a few places behind a man dressed as Father Christmas) with a time of 18 minutes, 23 seconds.
