Young cancer doctors are struggling to cope with the high demands of their job, a major study has found.

Across Europe, more than 70 per cent of oncologists under the age of 40 are showing symptoms of burnout that may affect their ability to care for patients, it is claimed.

The findings, from a survey of 595 doctors in 41 European countries, were presented at the annual congress of the European Society for Medical Oncology in Spain.

Lead author Dr Susana Banerjee, a 
consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Trust in London, 
said: 'Oncology is an exceptionally rewarding career but it can be 
demanding and stressful at times.

'Oncologists make complex decisions about cancer management, supervise the use of toxic therapies, work long hours and continually face patients suffering and dying.

'Furthermore, young oncologists are now facing increased administration, complaints/medico-legal issues, increasing expectations and workload with reduced resources.

'Taken together, these factors make oncologists at risk of developing burnout, a syndrome characterised by emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation (treating people as if they are objects) and loss of meaning or purpose in work.'

Burnout can lead to serious consequences including anxiety, depression, alcohol or substance abuse, and suicide, she said.

Burned-out doctors may also find it challenging to deliver compassionate, high-quality care to their patients.

The study showed that rates of burnout varied significantly across Europe. They were highest in central Europe, where 84 per cent of participants met the symptom criteria.

Lowest rates were found in the northern European countries, including the UK, where just over half (52 per cent) of young oncologists were affected.

Men and women were not significantly more likely to suffer burnout, but men showed higher levels of depersonalisation.

Factors linked to a higher risk of developing burnout were a poor work/life balance, lack of holiday time, not being in a relationship, living alone and not having children.

Burnout was also more likely in hospitals with small workforces, higher numbers of patients and no access to support services.

Dr Banerjee added: 'I believe, as a profession, doctors have a duty to try and address this growing issue at all levels - from universities, individual hospitals and professional societies such as Esmo.

'Burnout should not be stigmatised as a weakness. We need to support colleagues by focusing on recovery and prevention.'

Achieving a good work/life balance was vital and could involve interests outside daily clinical practice such as research, teaching and mentoring, as well as hobbies, exercise and spending time with family and friends, she said.

Dr Raffaele Califano, chair of Esmo's Young Oncologists' Committee, urged young doctors not to be put off becoming oncologists.

He said: 'This specialty remains one of the most fascinating and rewarding where physicians can make a huge difference in patient outcomes and quality of life.'
