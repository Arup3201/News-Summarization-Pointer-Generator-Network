A woman came home from her local markets with more than she bargained for after unexpectedly giving birth on the grass amidst dozens of busy stalls. 

Kashelle Knox, 28, hadn't been expecting her second child to arrive for another ten days but the Brisbane mother from Fairfield told Daily Mail Australia that she knew it was time while waiting in a queue for food at the Boundary Street Markets.

'After a few contractions I was like, this baby is coming now whether I like it or not,' Mrs Knox said.

She gave birth to a baby boy, almost two weeks before her due date, as 3,500 market attendees looked on

Market manager David Bostock said he was informed by paramedics that a woman was delivering a baby beside the Wurst-Meister market stalls and a café (pictured)

'I called my midwife and got my friend to call my husband to come and pick me up. We knew this one was going to be faster than my first [child birth], but not that fast.'

Mrs Knox gave birth within half an hour. By the time paramedics made it to the scene, the baby's head had already appeared and by the time her husband made his way over, his wife was presenting him with their newborn son.

Market manager David Bostock told Daily Mail Australia that there were over 3,500 people at the market with 'music was playing in the background' when Mrs Knox gave birth.

'I was closing a stall up when an ambulance drove up the driveway and I rushed out thinking someone was in trouble. The paramedic said someone was delivering a baby beside the Wurst-Meister shop and the café,' Mr Bostock said. 

Mrs Knox's waters broke just after a friend arrived to take her home: 'That's when my midwife recommended I move to a quiet corner and so I moved five metres away and had the baby,' she said

Her husband, Andrew (pictured with his newborn son), struggled to find someone to take care of the couple's first child so he could rush to his wife's side

'People took their shirts off and were handing her towels and now they're all hanging on the market fence on coat hangers all ironed and pressed with beautifully written thank you notes saying 'thank you very much for helping and supporting the birth of our baby'.

Mrs Knox admitted that while shy at first, and desperate for her husband to be there for the birth, she was forced to accept the circumstances.

'I told my friend I was feeling a bit funny, I was a bit nauseous, and as we were lining up for food I got more nauseous and said "I'm just going to sit here" and I was thinking I just needed to vomit,' she said.

'So I said "I'm just going to lie over there and vomit". I thought it was hunger nausea, but then I started having contractions. 

'I was a bit hesitant to relax into the contractions because I knew Andrew (right) wouldn't make it., but after a few contractions I was like, this baby is coming now whether I like it or not,' Mrs Knox (left) said

'I was a bit hesitant to relax into the contractions because I knew Andrew wouldn't make it.

'He couldn't find someone to look after our other child who was at home and had just been put to bed, so he was calling a friend to pick me up and bring me home, but by the time she had got there my waters had broken. 

'That's when my midwife recommended I move to a quiet corner and so I moved five metres away and had the baby. 

'Where I was, it was quite secluded even though it was next to the footpath, and I still had my clothes on at that point.

The proud parents are still yet to decide on a name for their newborn, who was born almost two weeks ago

'It's tough now because it's such a unique situation you want the name to be receptive of how unique the birth was,' Mrs Knox admitted

'I had to ask the friend I was with to find shirts because I knew he was coming - and then I took my shirt off and squatted over that so I could have him on that rather than the grass and dirt.

'We collected about six items of clothing that we went home with as well as ambulance blankets.'

The experience was documented by Mr Knox's mother, Ngaire Naran, and can be viewed on her blog.
