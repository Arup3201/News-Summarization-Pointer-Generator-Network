As Yasmin Le Bon turned 50 last week, jaws across the UK dropped and faces went green with envy. 

The woman barely looks a day over 35 and can even hold her own when posing next to her model daughter Amber.

In fact, even to the trained eye, the two women look like they are sisters, not mother and child.

Yasmin Le Bon (right) turned 50 last week but she looks just a few years older than her daughter Amber, 25 (left). Here the pair are pictured at the AmfaR Milan party in September. The supermodel isn't the only 50-something in Hollywood to look decades younger than their age 

While Yasmin may well be the most youthful-looking fifty-something celebrity, she is not alone in appearing startlingly fresh for her years. 

Sandra Bullock solicited similar gasps from the fairer sex after she turned 50 last July. 

Not only could the brunette pass for a 35-year-old, but in the 2013 film Gravity, she also revealed that had a body to rival a 20-year-old while float around in a pair of pants and a vest-top. 

Drinking from the fountain of youth isn't just reserved for Hollywood's women though - Johnny Depp turned 51 last year, but doesn't look like he has spent even close to half a century on this planet.
