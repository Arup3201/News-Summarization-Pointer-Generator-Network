Cesc Fabregas was on the receiving end of a harsh booking as his side chased a winner in their 1-1 draw with Southampton at St Mary's.

With the scores level on the hour mark and Chelsea continuing to pile on the pressure, the Blues midfielder was brought down in the Southampton box by rookie defender Matt Targett.

As the ball bounced high in between the two players Targett's right foot appeared to slip into Fabregas, who consequently fell to the ground.

Targett's right leg appears to trip the Chelsea midfielder but referee Anthony Taylor chose to book Fabregas 

Referee Anthony Taylor waved away the penalty shouts and proceeded to book the stunned Spaniard. 

The former Arsenal and Barcelona man could have well been sent for an early shower when moments later when he petulantly kicked the ball away, still seething from the decision Taylor had made earlier.

'We all know it's a penalty and the referee got it wrong,' said Sky Sports pundit Graeme Souness.  

Fabregas joins an increasing list of players to be criticised for not staying on their feet after dives from Willian, Gary Cahill, Diego Costa and Branislav Ivanovic have put Jose Mourinho's men in the spotlight.
