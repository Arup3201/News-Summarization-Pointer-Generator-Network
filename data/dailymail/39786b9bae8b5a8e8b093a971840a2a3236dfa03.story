The mother of missing Abigail Hernandez has written a letter to her daughter begging her to come home for Christmas as the teenager remains missing after more than two months.

Zenya Hernandez posted the letter to the family's website Bringabbyhome on Thursday. The 15-year-old vanished on October 9 from her home in New Hampshire. 

The family received a glimmer of hope after Abby wrote and posted them a letter in the weeks after her disappearance.

Authorities revealed few details about the letter out of fear copycats could hamper the investigation and asked the family to do the same. Investigators have given no updates as to whether the letter has produced any leads.

Abigail Hernandez, a New Hampshire teenager, has been missing since October. Her mother posted an open letter online this week begging her to come home for Christmas

Zenya Hernandez posted this heartbreaking letter begging her daughter to come for the holidays after she has been missing since October 9

Mrs Hernandez told ABC on Friday that she believed her daughter was still alive. She said: 'If Abby comes back, she won't be the ''missing girl''. We can get our lives back to normal.

'I would meet her anywhere she needs me to. She needs to know she is not in trouble with anyone. I just love her and want her home safe.'

In a heartbreaking open letter with a little sketch of a Christmas tree, the distraught mother wrote: 'I thank God every day that you are alive!

'I miss hearing your voice and your sense of humor. Please let me know what I can do to help you.

'Please come home for Christmas.'

Earlier on December 12, she wrote on the family's site: 'I will ALWAYS love you. I will ALWAYS have hope. i will NEVER stop looking. Love, MOM.'

Abigail Hernandez's mother Zenya (pictured left) with the teenager's sister Sarah wrote a Christmas letter to her daughter this week, begging her to come home

Abigail Hernandez wrote her mother a letter postmarked October 23 that was received by the family on November 6.

Officials
 delayed information about the letter so it could be thoroughly analyzed
 in order to be certain that it was actually written by the teenager.

Law enforcement officials say that although the letter has given them fresh hope, they fear deeply for Miss Hernandez's safety.

One
 FBI investigator suggested that Abigail could face a similar danger to 
the young women in Cleveland, Ohio who escaped after being held for ten 
years by Ariel Castro.

The last known picture of Abigail from her New Hampshire high school from October 9 before she disappeared

The content of the letter or where it was postmarked has not been revealed as police fear copycats could send letters that would hamper the investigation.

Abigail was last seen on Wednesday, October 9, leaving Kennett High School in North Conway.

Police
 said she walked her normal route home and sent several texts to a 
friend between 2:30 and 3pm. At first, police said she made it home but 
later this was proved false.

New
 Hampshire Assistant Attorney General Jane Young reminded the public to keep a lookout in their communities for any new faces that 
might fit Abby's description.

Authorities
 also released a picture of necklace that the teenager often wore along 
with a purse she was carrying at the time of her disappearance, in the 
hope of jogging someone's memory.

Police issued a picture earlier this month of this necklace similar to one which Abigail is fond of wearing in the hopes that it jogs someone's memory who has seen the missing girl

A picture of this purse was also released which Abigail had with her when she disappeared in October

Ms Young said: 'This is a child. She was 14 when she disappeared and had her 15th birthday a few days later.'

She added that the missing girl has no source of income, so someone is helping her 'whether that is a friend or what we fear is a foe'.

FBI investigator Kieran Ramsey said that they feared although Abby may have left willingly, she was now being coerced or manipulated.

Since her disappearance, Miss Hernandez's parents have made repeated public pleas for her safe return - even stating in a televised interview that they believe she got in a car with someone and that they believe she is in serious trouble.

Incentive: The FBI is offering a $20,000 reward for information in the missing person case

State and Conway police and the FBI 
have been inundated with hundreds of tips. The FBI is offering a $20,000
 reward for information leading to a conviction in the case, Boston.com 
reported.

The last call
 made on a missing New Hampshire girl’s cellphone was October 9 about 
four hours after she was last seen, investigators said.

The
 last sighting of the girl, who ran on the track team for her school and
 was described as quiet and bright, was around 2.30pm.

Investigators
 believe Abigail made it back to her home, but when her mother came back
 from her nursing job, her daughter was gone.

The schoolgirl's 15th birthday was on October 12.

Although investigators think that Abby may have left willingly, she may now be being coerced or manipulated

Police said they have not located the girl’s phone, but have determined that the last call was made at 6.30pm - about four hours after her last sighting.

It was used about two miles from her home at a spot near Cranmore Mountain - a popular local ski resort.

Abigail is 5ft 4in tall and weighs 118lb with brown hair and eyes. She was last seen wearing black stretch pants, tall brown boots and a grey sweater.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Conway police on 603-356-5715.
