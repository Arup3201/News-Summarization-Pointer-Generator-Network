An MRI machine exploded at a New Jersey animal hospital leaving a construction worker in critical condition and injuring two other workers.

The explosion took place at the Oradell Animal Hospital in Paramus on Friday around 11.51am while the repairmen were disassembling the machine to replace with a new one.

The man critically injured was taken to Hackensack University Medical Center after suffering from lacerations and crushing-related injuries to his body.

Two other workers reported respiratory complaints and other minor injuries, according to NBC New York.

The three men injured, who have not been identified, were not employees of the hospital but were contractors from an unidentified company.

All hospital employees and animals in the building escaped without injuries.

Police were called to the scene after receiving reports of fire, explosion and people trapped in rubble.

When they arrived, they found the roof of the east wing of the facility collapsed, but the remainder of the building still structurally safe, according to North Jersey.

It has not been determined what caused the MRI machine to explode. Following the blast, there was a helium leak, which was tended to by a hazardous materials crew.

Responding officers and firefighters were able to bring everyone out safely and also found no evidence of fire.

At the time of the explosion, there were around 60 animals and 100 staff members, who were in the western part of the building, with some animals being operated on when it occurred.

Charlotte, a five-month-old cat, was being spayed and had to have staples used on her instead of stitches to complete the surgery quickly, according to her owner Cheryl Dearborn.

Some of the animals, who were already in critical condition from previous medical issues, were transferred to other veterinary hospitals to continue their treatment (above animals, staff and pet owners are evacuated from the hospital)
