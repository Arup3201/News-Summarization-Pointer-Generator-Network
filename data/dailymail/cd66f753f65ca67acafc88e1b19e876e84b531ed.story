Private health companies are pocketing a record £18 million each day from the NHS budget as more and more health contracts are passed over to the private sector.

New figures from the Department of Health show that last year £6.6 billion was taken from the NHS coffers to pay private health providers - a 50 per cent rise from before the coalition took power.

Critics of the coalition Government's health reforms say this trend of allowing private companies to cream off NHS cash is set to increase.

Campaigners are also concerned that independent providers could be putting patients at risk as they strive to safeguard profits, which is cash sucked out of the NHS system.

But the Department of Health said charities, social enterprises and other providers have played a vital role in delivering free healthcare to patients for years.

The statistics, from the Department of Health in answer to a written question, show that in the year before the ConDem coalition took power £4.1 billion was spent with private providers.

This has now risen steadily through their term of office from £4.8 billion in their first year of office to last year's figure of £6.6 billion.

It means that around £1 in every £20 of the NHS's total £113 billion budget ends up in the hands of private health care providers.

In January, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham claimed the NHS would be sunk by a toxic mix of cuts and privatisation under the Tories, while Labour leader Ed Miliband said the service would be gone within five years under Conservative management.

Speaking on the issue last month Mr Burnham said: 'I believe we [Labour] let the market in too far and it's my view that if you carry on with this experimentation with the market in the National Health Service, you will in the end destroy everything that is precious about it.'

Last year it emerged that private providers were being paid to do one in five NHS knee ops, one in six hip operations and one in 10 cataract surgeries.

In one case a batch of outsourced cataract operations in Somerset left dozens of patients in severe pain from botched surgery.

Andy Burnham MP, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, said: 'These figures blow apart Jeremy Hunt's claim that NHS privatisation isn't happening'

The contract was brought to a halt after NHS medics saw a complication rate from the surgery of 10 times the expected amount.

A total of 37 of the 62 cataract patients seen by Vanguard Healthcare Solutions needed follow-up care. 

Two patients suffered burns, six lost pigment in their irises and four were left with microscopic shards of metal in their eyes after being operated on at the private facility.

Andy Burnham MP, Labour's Shadow Health Secretary, said: 'These figures blow apart Jeremy Hunt's claim that "NHS privatisation isn't happening". 

'It is happening and it is happening on his watch.

'This is because contracts are being forced out onto the open market by David Cameron's Health Act. Labour believes in protecting the public NHS and will repeal the rules that are fragmenting and privatising it.

'The NHS of the future demands more integration. The problem with this Government's policy is that it's taking it in the opposite direction, towards more fragmentation.

'These figures show what is at stake at the coming election. David Cameron's Government is stealthily hiving off NHS services without the permission of the public.'

A Department of Health spokesperson said: 'Official NHS accounts show that use of the private sector amounts to only six pence in every pound the NHS spends.

'Charities, social enterprises and other providers of healthcare play an important role in the NHS, as they have done for many years.' 

Answering the written question, requesting the figures, health minister Daniel Poulter, added: 'Independent providers, both for-profit and not-for-profit, have long through successive governments been providing care to National Health Service patients.

'Under this Government competition between providers of NHS services has been pursued on the basis of competition for quality through a system of fixed national tariffs. 

'Our position on who should provide services is taken to ensure patients receive the best possible services and outcomes. 

'These decisions are taken by the local clinicians, who are best placed to act for the benefit of their patients.'
