A woman who lost her pet Chihuahua in a lightning-fast carjacking has been reunited with the missing pup - though he has got dangerously thin.

Eleni Pappas, 23, stepped outside her Audi A4 at a gas station to pay for her fuel when an opportunist leaped in and sped away, with 11-month-old Leo still in the back seat.

The carjacking more than a week ago led to desperate pleas from Pappas for her pet to be returned - even without the car.

But this week she found the vehicle, not far from where it was stolen, in Mill Basin, Brooklyn. Leo was still inside, but a pound lighter after 6 days with no food or water.

Home at last: Leo was found in the stolen Audi A4, which his owner Eleni Pappas stumbled across while taking her aunt home

Best friends: Elani Pappas, 23, said she feels sick at the thought of her little dog Leo being taken by the thief

Returned: Pappas proudly displays Leo's named collar after he was returned - albeit lighter

For the tiny pooch, that's around a quarter of his body weight.

Writing on a Facebook page set up to help find Leo, Pappas wrote: 'Last night at 9 pm I was driving my aunt home.

'I forgot to turn down her street so I used another street.. while driving I saw an Audi A4 we got closer and saw my plate number.

'911 was called immediately, police came and I begged them to go check my car to see if Leo was inside because I was too nervous.

'The police officer approached my vehicle and came back with a huge smile and two thumbs up.

'Leo had been in the car for 6 days with no food or water... he is significantly skinny but he will be OK.' 

Describing the crime at the time, Pappas said: 'My puppy was in the car and I didn’t want him to get cold,’ she said.

Stolen car: Pappas posted this photo of her Audi A4 before it was stolen - it has since been recovered

Found! Leo the Chihuahua was inside the car when the vehicle was stolen at a gas station in Mill Basin

She left the car running and went inside the gas station to pay for her gas.

‘It was literally not even a minute,’ Pappas told The New York Post.

The 23-year-old legal assistant said: ‘I threw 20 dollars on the attendant’s desk, and I said ‘20 dollars on pump six,’ and as soon as I was walking out I saw the man sitting in my car and he just took off!’

She said:‘I tried to run after him, but he started going like 60 miles an hour.’

Reward: Dozens of family members and friends helped Pappas to hang up missing posters for the dog

Devastated: Pappas had said she wouldn’t care if she did not ever find the car but just wants the dog back

The thief drove  right onto Hill Avenue in Pappas’s dark blue 2010 Audi A4, and disappeared, with Leo barking loudly inside.

‘My dog is like my kid,’ Pappas sobbed.

Dozens of family and friends have helped Pappas to hang up missing posters on Sunday morning.

‘We wouldn’t care if we ever find the car.’
