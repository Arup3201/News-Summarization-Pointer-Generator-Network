These women are proving ballet is not just for the young as they attempt to realise their childhood dreams years long after their contemporaries have put their tutus away.

The senior ballet team, made up doctors, teachers and even policewomen, have come together in Guiyang, the capital  of south-west China's Guizhou Province, to perform.

But it is more than just a hobby: the women, who are up to the age of 60, have impressed so much Chicago Ballet has invited them to visit in June, the People's Daily Online reported.

Growing old gracefully: The senior ballet team is made up of 50 women from 40 to 60 years of age

Discovery: Many of the women only discovered a passion for dance when they were a bit older

Impressive: They have done so well, the Chicago Ballet has asked the women to visit the U.S. in June

The 50-strong group, who prefer to be called 'old girls', have been practising their pirouettes at the Mali ballet school after they convinced them to start a class for the over-40s.

Cai Hui is typical of the women who make up the 'old girls'.

Hui, who, at 60, is among the oldest, discovered her passion for dance late in life, following a career as a policewoman, and has been learning how to jeté and plié for the last seven years. 

'Although we are old, we still have chance to realise our childhood dream,' she said.

'We want to make our ballet dream come true, no matter how hard it is.'  

Skill: Cai Hui (wearing black top) is one of the older women in the class, at the age of 60

Dance: Many of the women come from professional backgrounds, and are teachers, doctors or policewomen
