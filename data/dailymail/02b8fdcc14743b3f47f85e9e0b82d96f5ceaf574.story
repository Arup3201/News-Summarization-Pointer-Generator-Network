X Factor 2014 went out with a bang last night as Ben Haenow took home the coveted crown.

While the show is a singing contest, each contestant has undergone a complete style overhaul, transforming from a fledgling pop star to a stylish X Factor alumni with a wardrobe to boot. 

The lady responsible for styling the stars each week is Gemma Sheppard, who has worked tirelessly behind the scenes for the last few months.

Grand finale: As X Factor 2014 drew to a close last night, FEMAIL caught up with the show's head stylist to get all the backstage gossip and find out her highlights from this season

Gemma has dealt with last minute wardrobe changes, demands from Simon Cowell and lots of stitching and sequins. 

FEMAIL caught up with the styling supremo about all things fashion - and how she's been called in by Tulisa as a stylist.

Speaking about the grand finale of the series that she's lived and breathed for the last few months, she said: 'The nature of this show is that every week brings a fresh challenge and a brand new creative. 

'There's no denying that the final takes it to another level, especially as we moved to the big stage with a live audience of 10,000.'

Big gig: Gemma and her team curated show-stopping outfits for finalists (L-R) Andrea, Fleur and Ben

Stepping in: Gemma also dressed Tulisa on Saturday night as she is one of her regular clients

Gemma certainly had her work cut out for her. Not only did she have to curate show-stopping outfits for finalists Ben, Fleur and Andrea, but she and her styling team were responsible for everyone on stage‎, as well as past contestants. 

If that wasn't enough, Gemma dressed Tulisa on Saturday night as she is one of her regular clients.

When Tulisa was asked to stand in for Mel B, Gemma got the call  to arrange her wardrobe. She pulled it off in just a few hours with a Stella McCartney dress and YSL heels.

Speaking about working with the show's contestants and nurturing their style, she said: 'It has been a real privilege to watch the contestants develop and to be part of the team that nurtures them into stars. 

'It is definitely a team effort: creative, hair, make up, styling, voice coaches and the mentors.'

She's had a blast: Gemma's  highlights from this year's X Factor include  working with creative director Brian Friedman; the fun backstage with the contestants, and making bespoke pieces

Sharing the golden piece of style advice she has given each of the contestants, she said: 'I've said right from the start that my part is to help the contestants feel confident in their look so it helps them deliver to their best on stage.

Andrea: He's got this charming, friendly character and his look is smart but with a softness. So a suit but with upturned trousers or a playful bow tie is his signature

Fleur: It's all about that bod for Fleur! Whether in a beautiful bespoke gown or rocking hotpants and a bra top, Fleur has been a dream to dress as she has embraced the styling process and used it to her advantage to make her performances so unforgettable.

Ben: I cite Ben as one of the contestants who has had a really subtle 'makeover'. He came to the show with a naturally casual look - a hoodie and jeans. We've just turned that into a cool rock star style, which he works with ease.

'So for them to go on now, I'd like to think they've all come to realise how their clothes can make an impact on their performance and to use that to their advantage.'

While it may seem that Gemma has the world's best job, it doesn't come without its pressures. 

Indeed, one Saturday night, just hours before showtime, the team decided to completely change Fleur's dress.

Despite her hectic schedule, Gemma wouldn't have it any other way and says she couldn't possibly pick a single highlight from her time on the show.

'From meeting the contestants for the first time, working with Brian Friedman, the fun backstage with the contestants, dashing around town with my team visiting fashion houses, working late with my seamstress making bespoke pieces, it's all been amazing. 

'Thank goodness for social media as via Twitter and Instagram, I have been able to create a visual diary of the last three months which I'll always look back on with pride and fondness.

'It's all been fantastic and I've been thrilled and honoured to be a part of what I consider to be TV history.' 

Gemma says it's been a privilege to watch the contestants develop and be part of nurturing them into stars
