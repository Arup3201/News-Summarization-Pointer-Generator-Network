Newcastle United have just three fit defenders ahead of Wednesday’s visit of Manchester United.

The Magpies have confirmed that left back Massadio Haidara will miss the game after picking up a knee injury during Saturday’s 1-0 victory over Aston Villa.

Midfielder Ryan Taylor is set to deputise after replacing the stricken Frenchman at the weekend.

Head coach John Carver is already without Steven Taylor and Paul Dummett, while Davide Santon and Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa were allowed to leave the club in January.

And he said: ‘We thought Haidara might be available but he's got a bit of fluid on the knee and has been for an injection, so he almost certainly won’t make it.

‘We're short of defenders and we've not got many possibilities, so Ryan comes into contention and he filled that role very well the other day.

‘But with another injury I'll have to start to try pulling rabbits out of a hat.’

When asked if he had been left short by the club’s failure to bring in January reinforcements, Carver said: ‘The squad itself is big enough, we've just been so unfortunate with these injuries.

‘You normally have three or four of these long-term injuries per season, but we've had more than that with nine already.

‘Our squad at the start of the season was in a healthy position, the only thing you can do is go into the out-of-contract market and it might be something we look at, but not yet.’ 

Papiss Cisse will be hoping to add to his first-half winner against Aston Villa when he faces Man United
