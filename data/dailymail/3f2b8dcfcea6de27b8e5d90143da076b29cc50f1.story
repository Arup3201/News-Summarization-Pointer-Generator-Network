For a rock star such as Bono, it has to be one of the cruellest blows his ego could receive.

Apple has introduced a special ‘button’ for iTunes customers – simply so they can delete his band U2’s latest album from their accounts.

The move follows a backlash by users who were unhappy at being given a free copy of Songs Of Innocence without asking for it.

Apple CEO Tim Cook, left, announced that all Apple's 500 million iTunes customers would receive U2's latest album, although many customers complained about automatically downloading Bono's latest songs 

Apple chief executive Tim Cook announced last week that all 500million iTunes customers would automatically receive a digital version of the album in their accounts ahead of its release next month.

But it seems many were not impressed, with thousands of protests on social media.

Some customers said they felt as though the album had been forced upon them by Apple.

To make things worse, others complained that they could not find an easy way to remove it from their iTunes libraries.

The protests prompted Apple to create the online tool allowing customers to get rid of the album.

It comes with a message: ‘If you would like U2’s Songs Of Innocence removed from your iTunes music library and iTunes purchases, you can choose to have it removed.

‘Once the album has been removed from your account, it will no longer be available for you to redownload as a previous purchase. If you later decide that you want the album, you will need to get it again.’

Apple’s senior vice president Eddy Cue announced yesterday that 33million iTunes users had so far accessed the album. He described the figure as record-breaking, although he did not elaborate.
