The wife of jailed Saudi blogger Raif Badawi - who faces another 950 lashes for 'insulting Islam' - has welcomed the Prince Charles' reported intervention in her husband's case as she clings onto the hope the new king might show clemency.

Ensaf Haidar, who is living in exile in Canada with the couple's three young children, is 'very hopeful' her husband may be released now Saudia Arabia has a new king, Salman.

Prince Charles' intervention on Raif's behalf is particularly welcome, as a monarch speaking to a monarch.

Yesterday, the MailOnline reported sources had confirmed Prince Charles had discreetly tackled the subject with Saudi's new king during a 20 minute chat.

The case has sparked international outrage - and yesterday Prince Charles even stepped in, with sources saying he had spoken to the new Saudi king Salman (both pictured, above) about the case

'I am hopeful the new king will show clemency on my husband,' she said. 'As for Prince Charles' support, it is very welcome, as is every sign of support from all over the world. 

'The fact that he himself is from a monarchy is important.' 

But Ensaf has warned her husband, who has not been flogged 'for medical reasons' since the first 50 lashes, is struggling.

'Raif is not doing very well, either physically or psychologically,' she revealed. 

'The children are also very worried and are not very well ever since they found out about the flogging.'

But Ensaf herself is very hopeful: the change in ruler could mean her husband's sentence of 10 years behind bars and 1,000 lashes is reduced, or even dismissed entirely.

Raif was handed the punishment for supposedly insulting religious figures and undermining the regime - a charge he and his wife Ensaf Haidar strenuously deny. 

In fact, he had been writing a blog on human rights. 

He is being flogged 50 times every Friday for supposedly insulting religious figures and undermining the regime - a charge he and his wife Ensaf Haidar strenuously deny.

The first 50 of the lashes were inflicted in front of hundreds in the main square in Jeddah in January - and the same was due to happen again for the next 19 weeks.

But so far, it has not come to pass: pressure from the international community appears to have halted the Saudi authorities in their steps. 

What's more, at the beginning of this month, Suad al-Shammari - the co-founder of Raif's blog, Saudi Liberal Network - was released after 90 days in prison in Jeddah.
