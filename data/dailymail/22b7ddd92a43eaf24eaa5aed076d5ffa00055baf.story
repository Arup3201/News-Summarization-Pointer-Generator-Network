A new iPhone thermometer app can tell worried parents if their child's temperature is too high, and guide them through a list of symptoms.

The technology uses a thermometer which plugs into the phone's jack to read temperatures.

It then displays the temperature on the screen, alongside a chart of possible symptoms for users to self-diagnose.

The thermometer app also keeps records of health issues, and gives users an 'illness 
forecast' estimating when they will get better and how contagious they might be.

Users living near each other can also compare symptoms to see 'what's going around' in the local 
area.

The Kinsa Smart Thermometer, as it is known, has been specially designed for children.

The device's founder, Inder Singh, struck upon the idea of developing the technology when he fell ill with a lung infection. 

He said after searching for clues about his mysterious symptoms, he found the internet 'void' of helpful information.

'Fever is an early sign of illness and I wanted to revolutionise the world's most common medical device.'

He believes that by collecting data on the time and location of a fever breakout, whole populations can benefit.

'We
 wanted to engage people who had just fallen ill in a conversationâ€¦to 
give them the information they needed to get better faster and to 
collect information to map health,' he told the website eWeek.

'By
 using mobile devices intelligently, we are creating simpler, smarter, 
connected devices that will be available at or below the current cost of
 these product.

'We 
believe that products like our thermometer will become the norm 
eventually.'
