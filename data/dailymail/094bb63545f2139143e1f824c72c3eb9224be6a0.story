These extraordinary photographs show the moment two of Australia's richest men started brawling in the street after falling out when one of them left his wife and started dating model Miranda Kerr.

James Packer and David Gyngell, both media moguls, have been friends since childhood, and Mr Gyngell was best man at Mr Packer's wedding to wife Erica.

But last year Mr Packer, 46 - son of pioneering broadcaster Kerry Packer - announced that he had separated from his wife, and allegedly began a relationship with Ms Kerr, Orlando Bloom's ex-wife.

Mr Gyngell, 48, apparently confronted
 his friend outside his Sydney home, and the pair began rowing about Mr 
Packer's treatment of his estranged spouse.

The
 two men, who both own extensive entertainment businesses, had to be 
separated by bodyguards, and were later fined $500 (£280) each for 
'offensive behaviour'.

Mr Gyngell accepted responsibility for the fight and pledged to co-operate with the police investigation into the incident.

'He
 fully accepts that he was the instigator of the incident,' a spokesman 
said. 'Clearly, had he not turned up at Packer's premises in an angry 
mood then the confrontation would never have occurred.'

The pair have told friends that they regret the fight and insist they will remain on good terms.

Mr
 Gyngell's wife Leila McKinnon today poked fun at the controversy, 
comparing it to the fight between Beyoncé's wife Jay-Z and her sister 
Solange Knowles.

'Ok
 so they're much better dressed and a little more discreet but I feel a 
kinship with Beyonce, Solange, and Jay Z today,' she tweeted.

Solange was caught on camera in New York's Standard Hotel wildly attacking Jay Z after the Met Gala after-party, requiring burly security guards to break up the fracas.

Ms McKinnon's light-hearted stab at her husband and his best man was well received by her Twitter followers and has so far been retweeted more than 80 times.

A Channel 9 publicist said: 'Leila is on maternity leave and not doing interviews as such... she really doesn’t have anything to add.'

James Packer and David Gyngell are both the scions of families which created television in Australia and - at least until now - had been friends for much of their lives.

Mr Packer, 46, is the grandson of Sir Frank Packer, who founded the station which would eventually become the Nine Network, Australia's first commercial TV network.

His father was Kerry Packer, notorious for transforming the world of cricket when he paid many of the world's top stars to join a breakaway league in the 1970s.

When James inherited the business empire, he invested in a number of casinos in Australia and south-east Asia, and he also owns the Aspinalls Club in Mayfair.

He married Erica in 2007 and the couple have three children together, but they announced they would separate in September last year and Mr Packer is now believed to be dating Victoria's Secret model Miranda Kerr.

The mogul is friends with Tom Cruise, and has publicly flirted with adopting the actor's Scientology faither.

Mr Gyngell, 48, is the son of Bruce Gyngell, who helped Sir Frank Packer set up the Nine Network and became the first person ever to appear on a national television broadcast in 1956.

He became friends with Mr Packer when the pair attended the private Cranbrook School in Sydney, and they have remained close since.

Mr Gyngell is chairman of Nine Entertainment Co., which owns Nine Network as well as a number of other media businesses.

He is married to Leila McKinnon, a presenter on the same network, and his sister Skye Gyngell is a celebrity chef based in London.
