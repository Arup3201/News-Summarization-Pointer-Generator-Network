A guitarist from a Britpop band who once appeared alongside Noel Gallagher has been decapitated in a horrific road accident.

Jeffrey Fletcher, 36, was killed instantly in a collision in Stockport on Monday afternoon after he leaned out of the window to check the road.

He was lead guitarist for Northern Uproar, who had their greatest successes touring with the likes of the Charlatans and the Prodigy in the mid-1990s.

Jeffrey Fletcher - who rose to fame in the 1990s as the lead guitarist of Northern Uproar - died in a horrific road accident in Stockport on Monday

His family said in a statement: 'We wish to remember our loving, caring, gentle giant Jeffrey Fletcher for his love of music, his talent on lead guitar and most of all, his infectious laugh.

'The outpouring of love and wishes from friends old and new shows us how loved he has been and this is a comfort to his family.

'We cannot comprehend the fairness of a loss of someone who had such success as a young man to have had his life cut so short in such a tragic and sudden way.

'He will be dearly missed by his family and all that knew him. Goodnight Jeff.'

The band (pictured with Mr Fletcher second left) were signed while still teenagers and regularly featured in music magazines NME and Melody Maker

Former bandmate Leon Meya added: 'Jeff was a gentleman and my friend since the age of five, we grew up together and went through school.

'He was a genius and learned the guitar in six months. He was the principle song writer, he could make melodies, sing and was a good performer. He made the sound of Northern Uproar, we were a great team.

'Jeff was recognised as a great guitarist, his guitar work was amazing. He was such a lovely caring bloke, I will miss a proper friend.'

The driver of the heavy goods vehicle involved in the crash remained at the scene and is assisting police with their inquiries. No arrests have been made.

Sergeant Lee Westhead said: 'Our thoughts are with Jeffrey's family at this difficult time.

'Officers from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit are currently investigating the incident and I would urge anyone who witnessed the actual collision or has information about Jeffrey's whereabouts immediately before the collision, to contact us.'
