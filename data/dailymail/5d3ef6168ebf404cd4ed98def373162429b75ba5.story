Countless books, paintings and films have attempted to portray Pompeii and its subsequent destruction in 79AD.

And now the famous Italian location has been immortalised in Lego.    

Named Lego Pompeii, the reconstruction took a master Lego builder 470 hours to complete and consists of more than 190,000 individual blocks.

It was constructed by Ryan McNaught, also known as The Brickman, and is on display at Sydney University’s Nicholson Museum.

The museum said the reconstruction is the largest model of the ancient city ever made out of Lego blocks.

It shows how the town would have looked at the moment of destruction in 79AD, how it looked when it was rediscovered in the 1700s, and how it looks today.

Since 2012, the museum has commissioned Mr McNaught to recreate three ancient sites, including a replica of the Colosseum in Rome and the Lego Acropolis.

The study of the cities of Vesuvius is central to the Higher School Certificate (HSC) Ancient History syllabus at the university. 

It was built by Ryan McNaught, known as The Brickman (pictured), and shows how the town would have looked at the moment of destruction in 79AD, how it looked when it was rediscovered in the 1700s, and today

The Forum of Pompeii recreated in Lego is pictured. It also shows features of the ancient city such as bakeries and bars, temples and marketplaces. The legacy of Pompeii in popular culture is also shown, from Bulwer-Lytton’s novel The Last Days of Pompeii (1834) to more recent Hollywood movies, such as Pompeii (2014)

Pompeii was a large Roman town in the Italian region of Campania destroyed by a volcanic eruption from nearby Mount Vesuvius in 79AD.

Reports claim that two thousand people died, and the location was abandoned until it was rediscovered in 1748. 

Many of the buildings, artefacts and skeletons were found intact under a layer of debris.

It is now classified as a Unesco World Heritage Site and more than 2.5 million tourists visit each year. 

In November, French and Italian archaeologists excavating areas of the ancient town found raw clay vases that appear to have been dropped by Roman potters fleeing the disaster. 

The city also forms the basis of undergraduate courses on Roman history.

The university said the Lego model helps introduce students to issues of Roman daily life, architecture and the history of the excavations.

Visitors and students can also explore Lego features of the ancient city such as bakeries and bars, temples and marketplaces.  

The legacy of Pompeii in popular culture is additionally shown, taken from Bulwer-Lytton’s novel The Last Days of Pompeii (1834) to more recent Hollywood movies, such as Pompeii released in 2014.

‘The use of a popular medium such as Lego enabled the museum to present the ancient world in a way that captures new audiences who may not necessarily be museum-goers and ensure that fun is a central component of the museum visit,’ said Craig Barker, education manager at Sydney University Museums. 

‘From personal experience I have seen children engrossed in the Lego display, but then actually spend far longer exploring the collection as a whole.

‘Education and entertainment need not be mutually exclusive in a museum.’

Reports earlier this year said that thieving visitors, who have been taking artefacts from the ancient Pompeii site for decades, have now begun returning their stolen wares to the museum.

In October, a 70-year-old woman returned an ancient decoration that she took from the attraction back in 1964 - and local archaeologists claim this is a common occurrence.

The unnamed woman picked up the small decoration during her honeymoon, and it is said to have formed part of the entrance to a theatre.

Director Massimo Osanna told Il Messaggero: 'We have been receiving hundreds of packages with hundreds of fragments now for years.

Stolen artefacts taken from Pompeii ruins (pictured) that have since been returned include tiles, painted plaster, stones and bricks.

Other stolen artefacts that have been returned include tiles, painted plaster, stones and bricks. 

And a fresco fragment, said to have been crucial to archaeologists hoping to restore the Casa Del Frutteto on the site, was returned in March after two decades.

Other artefacts have been recovered by customs.

In September, a large stone taken from the historical site was seized at Rome's Fiumicino airport after two Americans tried to take the 4-stone 10lb (30kg) artefact home in their suitcase.

Pompeii was a large Roman town in the Italian region of Campania that was destroyed by a volcanic eruption from nearby Mount Vesuvius in 79AD.

Reports said 2,000 people died, and the location was abandoned until it was rediscovered in 1748.

The 10 pots, which were found sealed beneath a later of ash and pumice, appear to have been ready to be fired.

It looks as if they were dropped as frightened potters saw the smoke and smelt the sulphurous fumes that would have been spewed out by the volcano - and decided to make a run for it.

Historical accounts and archaeological evidence show that many Pompeians took to the streets in a bid to leave the city, braving hot ash and pumice stones ejected from Vesuvius, with some collapsing from inhaling poisonous fumes.

Roman writer, Pliny the younger, described the panic during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius. Terrified Romans (illustrated) living in the towns of Pompeii and Herculaneum saw ‘sheets of fire and leaping flames’ as they ran through dark streets carrying torches with pumice stone raining down upon them, he said

Mount Vesuvius erupted (illustrated) on August 24 in 79AD, and the tragic events are immortalised here, beneath ash spewed from erupting volcano. People tried to flee the town, but many were buried by ash
