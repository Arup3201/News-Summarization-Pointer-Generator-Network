QPR are hoping to pip Barclays Premier League rivals Sunderland to the signing of Napoli striker Eduardo Vargas.

The Chile international has been offered to Arsenal and Valencia where he had a spell on loan last season.

Napoli want £9million for the 24-year-old but will also loan him out for £1m. 

Wanted man: QPR hope to beat Sunderland to signing Eduardo Vargas

Versatile: Vargas, pictured here scoring against Spain at the World Cup, can play centrally and out wide

QPR hope the chance to link up with compatriot Mauricio Isla may help persuade Vargas to shun the North East.

Sunderland want Vargas as doubts persist over a deal for Liverpool's Fabio Borini and Hull show an interest in Steven Fletcher.

QPR and Hull have also expressed interest in Mevlut Erding, 27, from St Etienne.

On the move: Napoli are willing to let Vargas go for £9million or a £1million loan fee and his wages paid in full
