At 30 years old, Ant the rescue donkey was no doubt hoping to live out his twilight years in peace at his local animal sanctuary.

Sadly, vandals put paid to that idea. The thugs broke into Sussex Horse Rescue Trust in Uckfield and spent 20 minutes spray painting the hapless animal with black and white stripes to make him look like a zebra.

‘I noticed something was wrong when a zebra came in for a feed instead of a donkey,’ said Felix Green of the Sussex Horse Rescue Trust, in Uckfield, Sussex.

White stripes: Ant the donkey has been transformed into a zebra after pranksters spent 20 minutes painting him

‘We did not see who did it so it must 
have happened sometime overnight. It must have taken the person who did 
it at least 20 minutes to paint it. He is not in pain but it really 
smells.’

Mr Green said another donkey, Pedro, had an ‘obscene image’ painted on his side.

He said: ‘We think they were targeted randomly as there are a lot of donkeys there.’

Painting donkeys to look like zebras has happened before.

Extreme makeover: While some may find Ant's new makeover amusing, the RSPCA has said it is a form of abuse which is not funny

Taped up: Palestinian zoo workers tape a donkey in order to paint it to look like a zebra because they cannot afford to buy a real one because of import restrictions

In 2009, a zoo in Gaza found a clever 
way to beat Israeli restrictions on animal imports by dyeing two donkeys
so they looked like zebras.

An RSPCA spokesman said the attack was
not amusing: ‘It’s shocking people would think it was funny to paint a 
donkey. It can irritate their skin and affect their breathing.’

Sussex Police said they are investigating the incident.
