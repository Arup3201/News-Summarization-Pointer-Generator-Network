Vernon Kay looks ahead to the second International Series game at Wembley this season as the Detroit Lions take on the Atlanta Falcons.

Detroit head into the game in with a 5-2 record atop the NFC North, and they’ll be looking for another win against a Falcons team that have lost their last four games. 

Everyone knows that the Atlanta Falcons are struggling with their offensive line and that is going to be a major issue at Wembley on Sunday. The Detroit Lions have the No 1 defense in the league and are only conceding 15 points per game. This could be a blowout by the Lions, but it could be a close game if the Falcons defense can step up to the mark.

Detroit have a formidable force up front on defense. When you watch the game live on Channel 4 at 1.30pm, make sure you look out for defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh. I was fortunate enough to meet him this week at an NFL event at NikeTown and he is a monster. He is nearly 23 stone of pure muscle and three times as wide as I am. I’m 6’4” and weigh 221lbs, but this guy literally dwarfed me and put me in a shadow as big as a solid oak tree.

Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan will have to establish his passing game early but, because of the amount of pressure that Suh and Nick Fairley are putting on quarterbacks, the Lions defensive backs are having a field day. The Lions have had 21 sacks and eight interceptions so far this season.

This Sunday is the first time ever that an NFL regular-season game will start as early as 9.30am Eastern Time. I’ve been fortunate enough to be at functions where the NFL have really played on the fact that we have an early kick-off. It is something they want to experiment with and see if there’s a market and an audience for a breakfast game in the States. If it gets good viewing figures, we may see future London International Series games being midday or 1pm kick-offs.

Calvin ‘Megatron’ Johnson is doubtful for the game and it will be a massive coup for the NFL if he plays on the hallowed turf at Wembley. He is a superstar and was on the cover of the game Madden, which is always a sign of respect. Johnson is tall, strong powerful and can run like the wind. He studies opposition so well to the point where he can manipulate them with the way he moves.

Calvin Johnson is a doubt for the clash at Wembley but it will be a massive coup should he play on Sunday

I spoke to Detroit quarterback Matt Stafford this week. I said to him: ‘No disrespect, but if I was Detroit Lions quarterback I would just throw the ball in Megatron’s direction.’ Stafford was laughing and said ‘absolutely, that’s all I do.’

Everyone thought Megatron would be a massive loss for the Lions but his replacements Golden Tate and Corey Fuller have really stepped up to the mark. What is opening people’s eyes is that the Lions have proved they can be successful without Megatron. At running back, Reggie Bush seems to have settled and Joique Bell is taking the workload off him too.

Their quarterback Stafford is a former first-round draft pick and has high expectations on his shoulders. He said this week that the transition of having a new head coach (Jim Caldwell) is always difficult, but everyone seems to have knuckled down as a team. You have to tip your cap to coach Caldwell and the offense for being so successful without Megatron.

Everyone thought they were a one-threat team, but who knows what is going to happen when Megatron comes back… hopefully this week at Wembley.

The Falcons are struggling at 2-5 and I feel sorry for quarterback Ryan. He was expected to have a phenomenal year but they have had such a slow start with injuries and key players out on the offensive line.

But they are still in the mix in the NFC South. It is a division that is really lacking in consistency and being led by a Carolina Panthers team at 3-3-1. I think it’s going to be a really close-fought division, but I wouldn’t count out the Saints. Each team in this division needs to get some momentum going. If whoever wins it ends up at 8-8, they’re not going to go much further than Wild Card weekend. 

WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR AT WEMBLEY

1. We are going to be in for a serious aerial bombardment. We have got two great quarterbacks who have established themselves in the NFL and can both throw the football in Stafford and Ryan.

2. If Megatron doesn’t play, look out for Tate. He is a former Seattle Seahawk and won a Super Bowl ring last year. Tate’s arrival has helped the Lions establish another aerial threat outside of Megatron.

3. Anyone who loves sport for the athleticism of the game, look out for Steven Jackson. The man is absolutely huge. When he puts his shoulder down, it is very difficult for defenders to stop him. I’m excited to see how he can run the ball. 

SUPERDOME SHOWDOWN 

The Green Bay Packers visit the New Orleans Saints in the late game on Channel 4 on Sunday. The Saints are struggling, but it is always a joy to watch Drew Brees. But the Packers are flying at the moment and, if Aaron Rodgers can do what he has been doing in previous games, this will be a two-score win for Green Bay.

Last week there was a really positive debate on my Twitter feed about what defines the best quarterback. Peyton Manning has defined himself as the best quarterback the league has ever seen from a statistical point of view - but he has only got one Super Bowl ring.

Rodgers is definitely in the group just below Manning and my favourite Tom Brady. What he brings to the team is an air of calmness. He is a real leader, but from a different angle. He uses a relaxed approach to the game and just lets his skills do the talking. 

Vernon Kay presents NFL: The American Football Show, Mondays at 11.50pm on Channel 4. This Sunday, Channel 4 will broadcast live coverage of the Detroit Lions vs Atlanta Falcons from Wembley, as well as the Green Bay Packers against the New Orleans Saints.
