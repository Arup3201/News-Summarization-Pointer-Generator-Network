Danny Alexander, the top Liberal Democrat at the Treasury, has ‘gone native’ and now gets on ‘famously well’ with the Tories, an aide to Chancellor George Osborne has claimed.

Nick Clegg was forced to defend his close colleague, insisting his ‘heart is exactly where it should be.’

But privately many Lib Dems fear that Mr Alexander has grown rather too comfortable with the Conservatives.

Tory MP Rob Wilson, a backbench aide to Mr Osborne, made the claim about Mr Alexander at an event for Conservatives in Westminster yesterday.

According to Huffington Post, Mr Wilson said: ‘The Treasury team gets on famously well. Everybody is friends. The relationship between George and Danny Alexander is very, very good.

‘I think Nick Clegg complains quite often that Danny Alexander has gone native in the Treasury. I think there is some truth in the fact he has gone native in the Treasury. The relationship is very good within the Treasury team.’

However, the comments will provoke alarm in Lib Dem ranks at a time when the party is desperate to differentiate themselves from their Tory coalition partners.

In the Commons today, Mr Clegg was forced to defend his closest ally from claims of being a closet Tory taken hostage by Mr Osborne.

The Deputy Prime Minister dismissed the reports, telling the Commons that Mr Wilson was as good a ‘wing man’ as the Greek legend Icarus, who famously fell in to the sea when the wax in his wings melted in the sun.

And he insisted that Mr Alexander's resistance to cutting the top rate of tax for the wealthiest earners showed he was a true Liberal Democrat, at a time when Tories want it reduced from 45p to 40p.

Mr Clegg said: ‘I have just see these quotes from Mr Wilson. He claims he is extremely close to the Chancellor, that he knows his mind, that he is the Chancellor's wing man. Well, he is as good a wing man as Icarus was in flying off on his own to judge by his comments.

‘The Chief Secretary to the Treasury is doing an outstanding job on behalf of the Government and on behalf of the Liberal Democrats.

‘Only last week he was saying that further cuts for the very wealthiest in society will happen over “his dead body”. That, and so many other examples, show his Liberal Democrat heart is exactly where it should be.’

Mr Clegg's comments followed a question from Labour MP Kevin Brennan who asked: ‘I know you will be aware of the concept of Stockholm Syndrome, where captives increasingly empathise with their captors. What are you going to do to de-programme the Treasury one?’

A coalition row erupted last week when Mr Alexander insisted that the top rate of tax for highest earners would be cut to 40p ‘over my dead body’.

The Chief Secretary to the Treasury said he would never allow it to happen ahead of the 2015 election.

But Tory London Mayor Boris Johnson said the current 45p rate was not reasonable, and warned the Lib Dems about make bold threats because the last thing he wanted to see was ‘the dead body of Danny Alexander’.

The future of the tax rate paid by people earning more than £150,000 has become a major political battleground.

In the last weeks of the Labour government then-Chancellor Alistair Darling increased it from 40p to 50p.

Mr Osborne then cut it to 45p in 2012, claiming the measure had raised ‘next to nothing’ for the Treasury.

Ed Balls has vowed to return it to 50p if Labour wins the next election, but Tories are pushing for it to be reduced further to 40p.

However Mr Alexander, the second most senior Lib Dem in the government, refused to yield to the Conservative demands.

‘I think it is right at 45 per cent. I wouldn't go to cutting below 45 per cent,’ he told the Daily Mirror. ‘I would say that would happen over my dead body.’
