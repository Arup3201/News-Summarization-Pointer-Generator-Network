This is the dramatic moment eight people worked together to rescue a horse that was stuck in a pond.

The animal, named Diego, wandered down to the brown, murky water in the village of Shipley in West Sussex to have a drink.Â 

But after cooling down, it found it was unable to climb up the pond's steep grass bank.

Its owner called the RSPCA after spotting the brown horse 'stumbling and tripping' as it desperately tried to escape from the water.

Two RSPCA officers then worked with six firefighters to rescue the animal last Wednesday afternoon.

RSPCA animal welfare officer Marie Stevens said: 'This poor horse was in a right pickle.

'He just couldn't work out what to do, and he kept stumbling and tripping in complete distress as he unsuccessfully tried to clamber his way back to the field where his friends were.

Back on dry land: RSPCA animal welfare officer Marie Stevens described the horse as being in a 'right pickle'. She added: 'He just couldn't work out what to do, and he kept stumbling and tripping in complete distress'

'It was difficult for us to know how to help him at first, but we called the fire rescue service and between us hatched a plan.

Ms Stevens said the six firefighters looped a large strap around the horse, before 'manually encouraging him up the steep bank'.

She added: 'It was a bit hairy at times and a lot of brute force was needed to reign him in, but eventually we got him to safety, much to the relief of his concerned owner.

'We are extremely grateful to the fire service for their help. There is no way we could have helped the horse without them.'

The horse, named after the character Diego in the animated children's film Ice Age, has now fully recovered from the ordeal.
