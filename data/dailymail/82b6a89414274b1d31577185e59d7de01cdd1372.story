Subtle changes in the way someone walks could be an early sign of dementia, a study has found.

Scientists at Newcastle University have discovered a link between changes in the gait of people with Parkinson’s disease and their cognitive function.

It could mean a person’s walk could be studied by doctors for warning signs dementia is developing – so treatment can be started earlier and symptoms managed better.

The study, published in Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience, followed 120 patients who had recently been diagnosed with Parkinson’s and compared them with a control group of healthy elderly people.

People with Parkinson’s are six times more likely to develop dementia than healthy people of the same age and this study is the biggest of its kind to look at patients in the early stages of the disease.

Participants walked around a 25-metre circuit for two minutes while their walking style was analysed by computers which can measure tiny changes undetectable to the eye. 

They were also tested on their cognitive function. 

The researchers found a ‘strong’ relationship between both a person’s pace and their attention levels and their postural control and their working memory. 

They intend to follow the subjects further to see how this link develops as they age.

Lynn Rochester, professor of Human Movement Science at Newcastle University and lead author of the paper, said: ‘Subtle changes in someone’s walking pattern, for example slowing down of steps and increased sway from side to side, are related to cognitive function even before changes are seen in cognitive tests.

‘Ongoing work will confirm if it is possible to predict future cognitive decline and dementia risk. However this early work shows great promise. 

'If we can use this and test people who may at risk, then we could pick up the early signs and begin treatment and advice.’

Dr Beckie Port, of charity Parkinson’s UK, said: ‘This research provides crucial insights into subtle changes in walking that could help us identify people with Parkinson’s who are at risk of developing dementia and problems with thinking and memory at a much earlier stage. 

‘This means people at risk can be monitored closely and receive treatments earlier.’
