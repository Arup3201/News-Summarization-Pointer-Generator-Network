Geologists believe a thick sheet of ice once covering Mars could explain the formation of a mysterious type of crater on its surface.

The unusual double-layered ejecta craters (DLEs) are, like other craters, surrounded by debris.

But unlike other craters, DLEs have two individual layers- a large outer layer with a smaller inner layer sitting on top.

Scientists believe the mysterious double-layer ejecta craters could have formed from blasts on Mars' once icy surface. The unusual shape could have been created when ejected material slid down steep crater walls and across ice, creating a top layer. Grooves, common in landslides on Earth, radiate out from the crater rim

Geologists believe these craters were formed as a result of hundreds of blasts on the Martian surface once covered by a layer of ice tens of meters thick.

By understanding how DLEs formed, they believe scientists can reconstruct the environmental conditions at the time of impact.

The findings were made by Brown University graduate student David Kutai Weiss and James Head, the university’s professor of geological science.

‘Recent discoveries by planetary geoscientists at Brown and elsewhere have shown that the climate of Mars has varied in the past,’ said Professor Head. 

‘During these times, ice from the polar caps is redistributed into the mid-latitudes of Mars as a layer about 50 meters thick, in the same place that we see that the DLEs have formed. 

‘This made us think that this ice layer could be part of the explanation for the formation of the unusual DLE second layer’.

The unusual craters appear at middle or high latitudes on Mars. These are areas where scientists believe there may once have been glacial ice on Mars millions of years ago

 Double-layered ejecta craters or DLEs, like other craters, are surrounded by debris excavated by an impactor. 

There are currently over 600  known DLEs on the Martian surface

What makes DLEs different is that the debris forms two distinct layers- a large outer layer with a smaller inner layer sitting on top.

These distinctive craters were first documented in data returned from the Viking missions to Mars in the 1970s, and scientists have been trying ever since to figure out how the double-layer pattern forms.

DLEs appear at middle or high latitudes-  areas where scientists believe there may once have been glacial ice on Mars millions of years ago.

In this scenario, the impact blasts through the ice layer, spitting rock out onto the surrounding ice. Because that rock sits on slippery ice, it doesn't all stay put.

Weiss and Head believe the layering occurs when material near the top of an upraised crater rim slides down the slippery ice and overtops material on the lower slopes.

That landslide, enabled by steep slopes and a slick ice layer, creates the DLEs' two-layered appearance.

‘I think for the first time since DLEs were discovered in the 1970s we have a model for their formation that appears to be consistent with a very wide range of known data,’ Weiss said. 

The landslide theory explains the unusual grooves that radiate out from the crater rim of DLEs.

Weiss has likened these grooves to the ones found in landslides on Earth, especially landslides on glaciers.

The theory also explains why DLEs tend not to have secondary craters surrounding them. 

Secondary craters are the result of big chunks of ejecta blasted out of the main crater, leaving gouges in the surrounding surface when they land.

The strange double-layered ejecta craters were first documented in data returned from the Viking missions to Mars in the 1970s. Scientists have been trying ever since to figure out how the double-layer pattern forms

But if that surrounding surface was covered by ice, evidence of shallow secondary craters would vanish when the ice disappeared.

DLEs appear at middle or high latitudes on Mars-  areas where scientists believe there may once have been glacial ice on Mars millions of years ago.

The scenario also requires a steep slope on the outside of a crater rim. 

A raised rim is partly a function of crater size, with larger craters generally having less uplift.

Weiss calculated that craters larger than about 25 kilometres probably wouldn't have steep enough rims to cause an icy landslide. 

With those results in hand, he surveyed about 600 known DLEs and found that nearly all of them are between one and 25 kilometres in diameter.

‘There are over 600 DLEs on the Martian surface, so reconciling how they formed with our knowledge of the climate of Mars is pretty important,’ Weiss said. 

‘It could tell us a lot about the history of the Martian climate on a global scale.’
