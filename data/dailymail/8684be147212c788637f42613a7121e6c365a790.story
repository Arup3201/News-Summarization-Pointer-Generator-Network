President Barack Obama will today meet with military leaders from some 20 countries and form a plan to counter the Islamic State, amid growing pressure for the U.S. to do more. 

Some three weeks before U.S. congressional elections, Obama will aim to show the U.S. public and allies abroad that he is committed to 'degrade' and 'destroy' the group that has taken over large swaths of Iraq and Syria.

Obama will attend a meeting led by General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with foreign defense chiefs at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington  to discuss the coalition's work. No major policy decisions are expected. 

President Barack Obama will today meet military chiefs from around the world to discuss plans to counter the Islamic State, amid growing pressure for the U.S. to do more to stop the terrorist group

Alistair Baskey, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said the meeting was part of 'ongoing efforts' to build the coalition and 'integrate the capabilities of each country into the broader strategy'.

The strategy is being called into question.

Referring to ISIS, Republican Senator John McCain said on Sunday that 'they're winning and we're not'. 

The United Nations said yesterday that fighting in Iraq's western Anbar province had forced up to 180,000 people to flee after ISIS, captured the city of Hit.

Analysts have said it is very important Obama shows that he is committed to fighting ISIS

Anthony Cordesman, national security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the fight against ISIS 'hasn't gone badly, but it certainly hadn't gone well'.

He added that it was 'very important' that Obama had to show both Americans and other countries that he was 'committed' to the fight.  

Representatives from Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Iraq, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates were expected to attend the meeting.

Colonel Ed Thomas, Dempsey's spokesman, said the meeting was about :'Coming together in person to discuss the vision, the challenges, the way ahead.'

Having Turkey at the table will be key. Ankara has come under some pressure to send its own ground troops into Syria against ISIS. The country could announce after the meeting that it will join Saudi Arabia in training moderate Syrian rebels, Mr Cordesman said.

Turkey has not reached a new agreement to let the United States use its Incirlik air base in the fight against but reached an agreement with Washington on training Syrian rebels, sources at the Turkish prime minister's office said.
