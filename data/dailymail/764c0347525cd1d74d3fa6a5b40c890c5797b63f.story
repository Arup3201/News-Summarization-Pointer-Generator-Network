Ofsted has launched an independent investigation into claims that a 'superhead' close to former education secretary Michael Gove knew about inspections weeks in advance.

Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, said fresh emails have come to light regarding three Norfolk schools all overseen by Dame Rachel de Souza.

The academies involved in the allegations are Ormiston Victory Academy in Norwich, Thetford Academy and Great Yarmouth Primary.

Ofsted has launched an independent investigation into claims that 'superhead' Dame Rachel de Souza knew about inspections at three schools weeks in advance

By law, schools can only be given half a day's notice of an inspection, but in August it was claimed the schools knew days, sometimes even weeks, before inspectors were due to visit.

In a statement, Sir Michael said: 'The ongoing claims that have been made about certain schools in Norfolk being given advance notice of Ofsted inspections are very serious.

'It is vital that the public has absolute confidence in the integrity of the inspection process. That is why I immediately asked Sir Robin Bosher to examine these allegations when they first surfaced in August.

'Sir Robin conducted a thorough investigation, which included 39 interviews with relevant parties and visits to the three academies in question. But I made a public commitment that should any additional evidence come to light, I would have no hesitation in bringing in someone from outside Ofsted to examine this.

Ms De Souza was principal of the Ormiston Victory Academy and is believed to have found out in advance about an inspection there by Ofsted, and requested for the school website and honour role to be updated

'For the avoidance of any doubt, I will be asking this independent reviewer to examine all the evidence originally considered by Sir Robin and to establish whether his findings and recommendations still stand in the light of the new email evidence that has now emerged.' 

The announcement came after the Observer presented Ofsted with a further set of emails which suggested de Souza discussed the timing of inspections with members of the inspectorate.

In an email conversation  between De Souza and a consultant for the Inspiration Trust Maggie Hollingsworth in July 2013, they  discuss an inspection date for Larkman Primary in Norwich.

Ms De Souza says she is due to meet the deputy director of Ofsted in the east of England, Paul Brooker, that evening. 

The allegations are also thought to include Thetford Academy in Norfolk, also overseen by the 'superhead'

And in another email exchange with a Department for Education official in May 2014, De Souza claims she has received a promise of an inspection in the autumn from Brooker.

Ms De Souza writes: 'Between us Paul has promised they'll come back in Autumn but what a waste of time really … and if it can happen to me then imagine schools with less experience …'

The original report into the claims was carried out by Ofsted's director of quality and training, Sir Robin Bosher.

It concluded Dame Rachel de Souza, chief executive of the Inspiration Trust, which at the time oversaw all three academies, was mistakenly copied into an email containing an inspection schedule.

A spokesman for Dame Rachel de Souza said: 'These emails are being quoted out of context. In both cases, Dame Rachel was following Ofsted guidelines and any suggestion that she was lobbying Ofsted improperly is false.

'In the first email to an educational consultant, she discussed an potential Ofsted inspection of Larkman Primary School, which was in the process of being taken over and converted into Norwich Primary Academy by the Inspiration Trust to improve educational attainment. 

Ofsted's guidance recognises that in these circumstances, with a change of leadership, an inspection may not be appropriate. 

'In the interest of transparency and ensuring the change happened in the best interest of pupils and parents, Dame Rachel explained the situation to Ofsted and they noted her views. 

'However, in line with their regulations, HMI on behalf of Ofsted did not divulge what effect this information would have on their decision whether or not to inspect the school.

'In the second email, Dame Rachel expressed her disappointment with the result of an inspection, which rated Great Yarmouth Primary as good with outstanding leadership. 

'She had hoped to show it was an outstanding school, but Ofsted indicated that one of the key factors they could not award that rating was the fact that exam results were not yet available. 

'Dame Rachel considered requesting a second inspection to confirm high or improving standards, and it was confirmed to her by Paul Brooker that she was entitled to do so under Ofsted's rules. In the event, this second inspection was not requested. Again, this is entirely normal practice and in line with Ofsted rules.

'We welcome the independent review of the original Ofsted investigation announced by Sir Michael Wilshaw, which we are confident will lay to rest these false allegations once and for all.'

Dame Rachel de Souza discussed an upcoming inspection date in an email conversation with  Maggie Hollingsworth from the Inspiration Trust in July 2013, released by the Observer.

On 4 July 2013, De Souza said: 'Do you think it would be better if they were inspected before sept? Or not? Be good to get your advice as speaking with PB this evening on other matters.'

Ms Hollingsworth responds 20 minutes later saying: 'I am worried that it is late in the year and Ofsted is pressed to finish its normal inspections. I would hate for a scratch team to go in and give it RI [a 'requires improvement' rating]. That could pull the rug out from under your plans completely.

'I would try to get a deferral till late in the spring term (the likely rise in maths SATs results should give you a good argument for Paul, if you need one) by which time the school could be moving rapidly in the right direction.'

Two days later, de Souza replies to Hollingsworth, saying: 'Spoke to PB who agrees with you re below & has noted.'
