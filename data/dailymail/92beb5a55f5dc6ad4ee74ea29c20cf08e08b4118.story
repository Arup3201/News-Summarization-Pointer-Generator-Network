Unfair dismissal: Dental receptionist Rachel Carr has successfully sued her old bosses after she was threatened with the sack for eating an apple at her desk

A dental surgery receptionist has sued her former boss after she was threatened with the sack - for eating an apple at her desk.

Rachel Carr, 28, was disciplined by managers at the Smile By Smile dental surgery in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, for snacking on the fruit while she worked.

She claimed that she was hounded out of her job, leaving last September after her health deteriorated as a result of 'double standards' at the practice where she said that her manager would snack on chocolate nearby.

She received a written warning for her eating habits and was accused of hiding in the equipment sterilisation room at the surgery and packing her bag to leave too early before the end of her shift.

But Ms Carr is now likely to be paid thousands of pounds in compensation after she successfully claimed constructive and unfair dismissal at an employment tribunal in Birmingham.

Rachel, who now works at another practice and represented herself in court, said: 'It was ridiculous.

'The apple was cut into slices and in a beaker and I just took a bite now and then.

'I wouldn't mind, but one of the partners used to eat Cadbury mini-eggs in reception.

'I'm just glad the system works. I represented myself, was not sure how it worked, but went in there and told the truth.

'They were gunning for me, hopefully, I've shown others they don't have to sit there and take it. They can do something about it.

Miss Carr said that she rarely left on time and that the allegations that she packed her backs too early were untrue.

Claim: Ms Carr sued the Smile By Smile dental clinic in Sutton Coldfield, West Midlands, where she had worked for five years

She says that the situation eventually forced her to quit her job when she became ill and collapsed.

'I walked out because the situation was making me feel ill and I could not take it anymore,' she said.

'I was on medication from my doctor, I was on sleeping tablets. I just collapsed in the doctors.

'I don't want to bad-mouth anybody because I'm a private person and worried about my career.

'But I could not stand by and watch them get away with this.

She added: 'It has made my life hell and I just want it to blow over now so I can concentrate on my new job.

'Most people would think dentists would approve of eating apples, after all as the saying goes 'an apple a day keeps the doctor away' but in my case it cost me my job.'

Rachel told the tribunal that she had never received any complaints about her conduct in the five years she had worked at Smile By Smile.

But she said that the situation changed when new bosses came in and brought their own rules with them.

The private dental surgery claimed that they had concerns about Ms Carr's ability to 'follow procedure', and gave her a final warning for misconduct after they alleged that she was taking personal calls on her mobile and looking at Facebook during working hours as well as eating an apple.

It was also claimed that Ms Carr had forgotten to turn off the X-ray machine.

Smile for Smile are appealing the decision.

Smile to Smile dental surgery last night said they were planning to appeal the tribunal decision.

Spokesman Dr Peter Patel said: 'Smile by Smile puts patient's needs and clinical excellence at the heart of the service they provide.

'The partners have read the judgment and are taking legal advice for an appeal.

'At this stage it would be inappropriate for us to comment on the judgement and issues regarding employment and conduct of Rachel Carr at Smile by Smile in view of the fact that the case may go back to the Tribunal for an appeal.'
