With ski holiday season upon us, families will be booking flights to mountaintop resorts for winter wonderland getaways in the coming weeks.

But while travellers may think they have snared a great deal, unexpected fees for bulky ski baggage may land them with a far more expensive airfare than originally thought.

With this in mind, Skyscanner has created a guide outlining the cost of bringing ski equipment on flights.

The cost of skiing: A new guide from Skyscanner compares the cost of bringing ski equipment on flights

The guide compares more than 20 airlines, including Ryanair, easyJet, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic, to see which of them allow ski equipment such as skis, boots and poles, to be taken within normal hold luggage allowance or whether additional fees are charged.

Additional fees for ski baggage may result in what seemed like a cheap flight tripling in cost.

For example, a Ryanair flight from London to Grenoble is £24.99 each way. Add extra 'ski fees', and the end cost is £189.98 return with ski equipment. In comparison, the £189.14 flight with BA includes ski equipment up to 23kg.

Size restrictions on baggage are also a factor: While Air France, Air Berlin and KLM allow bags of up to 300cm, others such as US Airways, Austrian, United and more restrict baggage to 158cm.
