A 10-year-old boy with learning difficulties died after getting caught in a curtain cord at his family's home home.  

An ambulance crew and a rapid response paramedic raced to the semi-detached home after receiving a 999 call reporting that he had stopped breathing.

He was given CPR and taken under police escort to hospital, where he was  unable to be saved and was certified dead.

The boy was taken to St Mary's Hospital in the Isle of Wight (pictured) but was unable to be saved 

A police spokesman said: 'Police can confirm that they were called to an address in Ryde, Isle of Wight, at about 3pm on Sunday. 

'A 10-year-old boy was taken from the address to St Mary's Hospital on the Isle of Wight, where the boy later died.'

The boy's mother, Jodie Tuckey, 32, a mother-of-two said she was too distraught to talk.

Neighbour Sally Woods, 64, a retired support worker, said: 'When I got home there were three police cars parked outside the house.

'I used to see the boy at the bus stop down the road after he got dropped off by the special bus.

'His mum used to pick him up from the bus stop and she would always say hello. 

'It is such tragic news. Whenever I saw him he was always smiling, he was always happy.' 

The boy was not breathing when paramedics arrived at his home. 

Isle of Wight Ambulance Service received the 999 call on Sunday afternoon and an ambulance arrived at the scene at 2.47pm.

An Isle of Wight NHS Trust spokesman said: 'We received a 999 call during the afternoon of Sunday, December 7, in which the caller indicated that a young boy was not breathing.

'The Ambulance Service despatched a 999 emergency ambulance which was on the scene at Binstead at 2.47pm, a rapid response vehicle which arrived at the scene at 2.49pm, and an officer was on scene at 2.50pm.

'An emergency transfer with Police escort was made from the scene to the Emergency Department at St. Mary's Hospital arriving at 3.15pm.

'The Air Ambulance was activated at 2.51pm but was stood down at 3.00pm.

'Sadly, despite the best efforts of paramedics, doctors and nurses, the young boy could not be saved.

'He died at 4.10pm on Sunday, December 7, and the Coroner has been informed.

'We would like to extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the young boy.'

Detectives from Hampshire Constabulary were investigating the incident and officers remained on guard outside the property today. 

Neighbours reported seeing scenes of crime officers wearing face masks, moving in and out of the property and removing bagged items from the house.

However a spokesman for Hampshire police said they were not treating the death as suspicious and directed further questions to the coroner.
