Obama and Jeter, who played his last game for the Yankees on September 28, were spotted playing golf at Shadow Creek in North Las Vegas, one of the most prestigious courses in the world. 

They were joined by Obama campaign supporter Stephen Cloobeck and the owner of the Las Vegas Sun newspaper, Brian Greenspun.

Obama, who has played more than 200 rounds of golf as president, took around five hours to play the 18 holes at the MGM Resorts International-owned course on Saturday.

However after completely the course, which was built by casino mogul Steve Wynn in 1989, he decided to play an additional nine holes,  the White House told the Associated Press.

Meanwhile, Jeter, who experienced a Hall of Fame career, is likely to need improvement in his golf game. A 2006 Golf Digest ranking of athletes who play golf put his handicap at a pedestrian 30.

Obama is spending the weekend in Nevada following his immigration speech at a Las Vegas high school on Friday.

During the speech, the 53-year-old announced a plan to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants with an executive order allowing them to stay instead of facing deportation.

'We’re going to offer the following deal. If you’ve been in America for more than five years; if you have children who are American citizens or legal residents; if you register, pass a criminal background check, and you’re willing to pay your fair share of taxes - you’ll be able to apply to stay in this country temporarily, without fear of deportation,' Obama said. 

The proposal - affecting around five million immigrants - sparked anger among Republications, who complained about so-called 'anchor babies' helping their illegal parents remain in the U.S.

Obama returns to the White House on Sunday.
