An engineer working 240 feet above ground on a cell phone tower in Kentucky was decapitated after a cable broke with emergency services unable to bring down his body for five hours.

Police said that the man, who was in his 20s, was one of two workers on the Verizon tower in Harrison County near Cynthiana when a heavy antenna fell and a cable struck him yesterday.

It is thought the men were taking down an old boom when the incident occurred, decapitating the worker and ripping off his right arm.

Local sheriff Bruce Hampton said that the man was suspended hanging from the tower in his safety harness as the emergency services struggled to bring down his body.

Crews from the Northern Kentucky Technical Rescue finally removed the body five hours after the incident took place.

He also confirmed that another two workers were on the ground when the incident happened and that nobody else was injured.

He told WKYT: 'Not too many people are used to seeing that. And it's a guy that you've been working next to. And it could have been him. Nobody else was injured. And they are just very much beside themselves.

‘It got within two feet of where it was going and something broke and then the 1,800lb boom fell,’ said Sheriff Hampton.

It has been reported that the workers, who were all in their 20s were working for an independent company contracted out by Verizon.

The victim has not yet been identified and his body has been sent to Frankfort for an autopsy.

Police didn't release the name of the company he worked for or any other information.

In a statement Verizon Wireless said: 'Our thoughts are with the family and colleagues of those impacted by today's incident near Cynthiana, Kentucky.

'We are working closely with our vendor and first responders on the scene as we continue to gather additional information.'
