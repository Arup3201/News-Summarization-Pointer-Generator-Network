Shadow Minister for Sport Clive Efford was first to berate the Premier League for not spending enough on grassroots football after the jackpot £5billion TV rights deal was announced.

Efford said: ‘These are incredible sums of money and it would be nothing short of criminal if none of the extra money goes to expand participation at the grassroots of football.’

Yet it did not escape Premier League notice that on Wednesday — the day after the TV bonanza was secured — Efford was at the opening of a new £400,000 3G football facility in his Eltham constituency funded by the Premier League and FA.

Sky Sports, whose pundits include Graeme Souness (left) and Thierry Henry, secured five of seven Premier League packages in the new deal from 2016-17 at a cost of more than £11m per match

It also emerged that the Premier League had wanted their name added to Efford’s quotes in the Press release acknowledging the work of the Football Foundation in delivering the project. But Efford declined the request, saying his words were fine as they stood.

The MP said the Premier League should ‘live up to their promise’ that five per cent of their domestic TV income goes towards growing the game. The Premier League’s answer is that, along with their solidarity payments, they already contribute more.

But Efford insists: ‘If that was the case there would be a lot more pitches and coaches at community level.’

The England Cricket Board will allow struggling one-day captain Eoin Morgan to play in the entire Indian Premier League, for which the auction takes place next Monday. 

Morgan, who has failed to score runs in the World Cup build-up, is fortunate to have the go-ahead from both county Middlesex and England, with whom he has an incremental contract, to play all the IPL when the issue has caused big problems in the past — particularly for Kevin Pietersen. 

The domestic Twenty20 starts in May, before the end of the IPL, but the ECB have relaxed their approach because it will be good experience for players ahead of the 2016 World Twenty20 in India.

Hollywood star Willem Dafoe got a big hug rather than the cold shoulder from Jose Mourinho

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho may be avoiding talking to the media or aborting interviews if he does not like the question. 

However, Hollywood film star Willem Dafoe was in the Chelsea Press room on Wednesday night and received a rather more friendly greeting. 

There was a big hug, followed by the pair leaving arm in arm with Dafoe invited into the dressing room. 

Mourinho, a BT Sport ambassador, is understood to have met Dafoe while filming for the TV network.

Chelsea, who need to find a new shirt sponsor now a mooted deal with Turkish Airlines has stalled, have brought in former Liverpool chief executive Christian Purslow to head their revamped commercial operation. 

Purslow in turn has hired outside agency HTH Associates to help him in the hunt. HTH was formed by two ex-Manchester United commercial executives, Leo Thompson and Harry Horsley. 

However, using Old Trafford sponsorship expertise does not automatically work — as the FA have found with former United global sponsorship manager Phil Barker failing to find a backer for the FA Cup this season.

The poor state of Bradford’s Valley Parade pitch ahead of their fifth-round FA Cup tie against Sunderland on Sunday has not been helped by impoverished groundsman Mick Doyle having to improvise with a homemade snowplough put together from old pieces of wood. 

Belatedly, Bradford have agreed to new equipment and having the pitch relaid with the proceeds from their Cup run.

The England Cricket Board, despite sacking around 15 staff, have invested in outside agency FutureProof to come up with ways of inspiring the team. 

The first collaboration is #LoveEngland, which is only a marginal improvement on the bizarre #RISE campaign for the Ashes.

Alexander’s a red devil

The sighting of Manchester United club secretary John Alexander mouthing the words of Liverpool anthem You’ll Never Walk Alone in the Anfield directors’ box for the midweek game against Tottenham is unlikely to go down well with United fans. 

Alexander, who arrived at Old Trafford from Spurs, has a strong allegiance to Liverpool. So much so, former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson used to give him plenty of stick.
