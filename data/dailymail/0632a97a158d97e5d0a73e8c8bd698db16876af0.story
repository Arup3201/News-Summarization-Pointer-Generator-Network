The engineer of a New
York commuter train that plowed into a vehicle this week at a
suburban rail crossing picked up an injured passenger and
carried him off the train as it became engulfed in flames,
federal investigators said on Friday.

The heroics of Metro-North engineer Steven Smalls Jr., 33, a
married father of two, were described at a news conference held
by the National Transportation Safety Board three days after the
deadliest rail accident in the New York area in more than three
decades.

Six people died on Tuesday evening after the rush-hour
train, traveling from New York's Grand Central Terminal, struck
a Mercedes sports utility vehicle that became stuck on the wrong
side of a crossing gate in the Westchester suburb of Tarrytown.

Hero: Metro-North engineer Steven Smalls was at the controls when an SUV entered the tracks and collided with his train earlier this week in Westchester, New York

Lifesaver: The engineer of the Metro-North train that slammed into an SUV at a Westchester railroad crossing, killing six people, ran back into the burning train after the fiery crash to rescue people inside

After exiting the engineer's compartment moments after the
crash, Smalls helped five or six passengers escape the first
train carriage and then noticed a passenger who was unable to
walk crawling toward the door, said NTSB member Robert Sumwalt.

'He picked him up and held him in a fireman's pose,' Sumwalt
said.

Smalls, an Air Force veteran, was interviewed on Thursday by
federal safety investigators who described his demeanor as very
professional, Sumwalt said.

'It goes without saying he's very traumatized,' Sumwalt said
at a final press briefing a few miles away from the crash site
in Valhalla, New York.

Telling his story: The engineer, Steven Smalls, met with National Transportation Safety Board investigators Thursday. His attorney, Jeffrey Chartier, said he was 'completely cooperative' in his meeting

Funerals for the SUV driver and one of the five train
passengers killed in the fiery crash were held on Friday as
investigators looked for clues about how the accident unfolded.

The grieving husband of Ellen Brody, who was behind the
wheel of the 2011 Mercedes ML350, said she had been on her way
to meet a new client and did not know the area where the crash
occurred.

The vehicle became stuck on the wrong side of a rail
crossing gate and was hit by the train that departed New York
City during Tuesday's evening rush hour.

'Somehow she wound up in a strange, unfamiliar place,' Alan
Brody was quoted by the New York Times as saying during a eulogy
for his 49-year-old wife, who worked in a jewelry store and was
the mother of their three daughters.

Mr Smalls, recounted the ill-fated train's final minutes, and how he helped as many as seven people to safety from the burning train, when investigators interviewed him

He described his own thoughts when, in the past, he drove
through the upscale hamlet about 25 miles north of midtown
Manhattan.

'I also remember thinking, 'Are you kidding? Who could
imagine that a major commuter railroad runs through this?'' he
told mourners gathered at Chabad of the Rivertowns in Dobbs
Ferry, New York.

A funeral was held in the Westchester County town of Mount
Kisco on Friday for one of the train passengers, Eric Vandercar,
who worked at Mesirow Financial.

The train was traveling at 58 miles per hour when Smalls saw
a reflection on the tracks ahead, realized it was woman stuck in
a vehicle and engaged the emergency brake.

Four seconds later
the train struck the SUV, moving at an estimated speed of 49
miles per hour, the NTSB said.

As the train ground to a halt, the electrified third rail
snapped apart and twelve of the 39-foot sections skewered the
first carriage, reaching the ceiling. One of the sections passed
through and pierced the second carriage.
