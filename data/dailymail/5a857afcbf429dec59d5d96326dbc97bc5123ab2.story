Ally McCoist has revealed he is ‘extremely hopeful’ that rival businessmen Dave King and Mike Ashley will join forces to save troubled Rangers from fresh financial chaos.

King jetted into Scotland earlier this week to address the Ibrox board on his £16million rescue package. The South African-based millionaire, who has teamed up with ex-Blue Knight Paul Murray and wealthy fan George Letham, spent around two hours spelling out his plans for investment which would also secure a 51 per cent stake in the club.

Ashley, in the meantime, is trying to push through his own change and wants an egm that would remove King allies Graham Wallace and Philip Nash from their posts.

McCoist is optimistic that business rivals Dave King and Mike Ashley can join forces to save the club

McCoist, however, remains optimistic the warring factions can strike a peace deal and secure the future of the Glasgow giants.

‘I’m delighted that now, for the first time, we have a serious opportunity of investment from a couple of areas,’ he said.

‘It’s been well documented that Mike Ashley has increased his shareholding and it has been well documented there has been a series of meetings with Dave King’s team and the board.

‘I would be extremely hopeful that a compromise and a deal can be done, involving all parties, allowing us to move forward.

‘If you are asking me whether I’d rather take two investors instead of one, or two instead of three, then I would obviously go for the greater amount of investment.

‘I don’t really know both personalities and I don’t know exactly what they want but I would imagine if they could work together it would increase investment.

‘So it would make sense to say if you have two great businessmen on board then it is better than one great businessman.’

Ashley’s increased involvement has proven unpopular with Rangers fans who last weekend staged protests at his Sports Direct stores after objecting to his growing influence at the club – with more ‘flash mob’ activities planned for coming weeks.

It makes McCoist’s declaration on Friday that he would back an Ashley-King ‘dream team’ all the more noteworthy.

‘I spoke to Dave on the phone before his meeting,’ he said. ‘As you know I go back with Dave from the previous time he was on the board.

‘All he told me was that he was in meetings with the board. He hasn’t told me anything confidential in terms of the business side of things.

‘He said he was hopeful of pushing things forward. He said he was very, very keen to get a deal done that will push the club forward. Other than that there was no indication of what the meetings where about and I haven’t spoken to him since.

‘Graham Wallace hasn’t put a specific timescale on it, but he was also hopeful that something would be sorted out sooner rather than later.

‘I’ve said all along that at some point in the near future we are going to need investment in the club.

‘You hear concerns about money running out and people not getting wages. That has never been said to us at all, but in terms of the team and club, whether it is Murray Park, Ibrox or strengthening the team we will definitely need investment.

‘The more investment we can get the better and now we have two fantastically respected businessmen hovering about the club with a view to taking it forward.’

McCoist insists that the only certainty regarding Rangers' future is that the club needs investment

McCoist however warned Ashley that his attempts to oust Wallace at an egm would cause further instability.

‘Of course it’s a concern,’ he said. ‘We’ve had more chief executives and potential owners in the last three years than we have done in the previous 30 years.

‘What would be concerning would be that it would create uncertainty and instability again with more changes at boardroom level. That wouldn’t be ideal. But that’s totally and 100 percent outwith my control.’
