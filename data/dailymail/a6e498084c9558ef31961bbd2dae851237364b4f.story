Art director by day, master manipulator by night.

Germany-based digital artist, Robert Jahns, is wowing social media-savvy art enthusiasts with his stunning, surreal photographs of locations around the globe.

From Venice's canals to the New York City skyline, Jahns creates every single image using only his iPhone and editing apps, like VSCOcam, ArtStudio and Snapseed. 

This spectacular mountaintop shot is captioned: 'She lives her life in her own little fairytale'

'Who would you go with?' he captioned this rocky beachfront snap on Instagram

Many of the photos are taken from his travels around the world and all are edited using just an iPhone

'Life isn't about waiting for the storm to pass...' Jahns captioned this death-defying snap

The editing process can take as little as two hours or as long as several days and many are crafted from photos that he's taken during his travels.

Usually shot with an iPhone and occasionally a DSLR, the world traveller also has been known to use composites of stock images and collaborations with other photographers to create his fantastical images.

Janhs uploads the photos to his Instagram account, nois7, which already boasts more than 620,000 followers.

'You want the moon? If you want it I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down for you,' he wrote of this composite

Each image garners up to 41,000 likes and hundreds (and even thousands) of comments, with some of the most popular being snowy landscapes and eagle-eye photographs from high above the Big Apple.

The New York City shots are particularly unique, as some of those were shot from a helicopter high above Central Park.

The talented artist, who has worked with the likes of Tyra Banks and has exhibited his work in Los Angeles and Berlin, is now selling limited edition prints via his website.
