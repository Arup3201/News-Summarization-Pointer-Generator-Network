Google hopes a new low cost laptop could tempt buyers away from new tablets from Apple and Microsoft.

The lightweight computer will sell for £229 ($249) and is being made with Samsung.

It was revealed just days before Apple is expected to unveil a low cost version of its iPad tablet, and Microsoft and Amazon begin selling their tablet computers.

Google has launched an aggressive advertising campaign for its new laptop, claiming the £229 machine is 'for everyone'

 Unlike a traditional laptop, the Chromebook has no hard drive, instead keeping all of its information on Google's servers.

This means that while most functions can still be used without an internet connection, some are limited.

Google also supplies a virtual Drive for the machine, which users can also access from a desktop Pc and even their mobile phone.

The Google machine's software is based on Google's Chrome web browser.

Like other so-called Chromebooks, this laptop doesn't have a hard drive, instead storing information on Google's internet servers.

The machine in the latest Chromebook, a line Google first released two years ago.

It will go on sale early next week in PC World stores in Britain and more than 500 Best Buy stores in the U.S.

'This is a big step in the journey for 
us,' said Sundar Pichai, Google's senior vice president of Chrome and 
apps.

'I think it's generally an exciting time in the computing 
industry.'

Like tablets, the 
discount Chromebook will rely on a computer chip design known as ARM, 
instead of Intel microprocessors.

The ARM architecture is more 
energy efficient, extending the duration of batteries between charges.

With
 an 11.6-inch (29.46-centimeter) screen, the new Chromebooks also will 
have a larger display than tablets selling in the same price range.

The Chromebook launch comes as Google suffered the single largest 
plunge in stock market history on Thursday when $24billion (£15billion) 
was wiped off the company's value after its results were accidentally 
released.

The catastrophic error revealed that profits were down by 20 per cent.

Trading
 in the company's stock was halted when its shares fell by nine per cent
 in just eight minutes following the release of its disappointing 
earnings report.

The report
 was leaked ahead of schedule when a printing firm working for Google 
put out an incomplete press release without authorisation from the 
online giant.

The plunge prompted worries that a 
second dot.com crash could be on the way.

Google's troubles coincide 
with a steady fall in Facebook's share price and the ongoing struggles of newer start-ups such as Groupon and Zynga.

Google's
 third-quarter profits fell 20 per cent on a year earlier to 
$2.18billion (£1.35billion) - well below analysts' expectations.

The dire results were due to be issued after the markets had finished trading for the day.

But because they were released early, investors were able to dump their stock and send the shares into a nosedive.

The
 laptops will be set up to automatically use all of Google's services, 
including its search engine, Gmail and YouTube video site.

Because the 
laptop lacks a hard drive, Google also is offering 100 gigabytes of free
 storage on computers kept in its eight data centers.

Those remote 
computers provide the backbone for Google's online storage service, 
Drive.

However, despite the low price,
 experts say the new Chromebook will face a tough time winning over consumers 
because it isn't set up like a traditional PC with a hard drive, said 
Gartner Inc. analyst Carolina Milanesi.

'A lot of people are going to see it and think, `Once I have it, what exactly do I do with it?"' Milanesi said.

Google,
 which is based in Mountain View, California, will try to educate and 
woo prospective buyers by setting up Chromebook kiosks in Best Buy 
stores where staff will be on hand to field questions.

The company also 
will promote the new Chromebook in television ads.

The
 attempt to grab a few early headlines Thursday backfired, though, when 
Google prematurely released its third-quarter earnings while the company
 was providing a preview of the low-priced Chromebook to a group of 
reporters.

For the user, the main difference between Google's laptop and others is the fact that everything is done within Google's Chrome browser.

The
 laptops are set up to automatically use all of Google's services, 
including its search engine, Gmail and YouTube video site. 

Goolge also offers online spreadsheets, word processing and other office applications.

With
 an 11.6-inch (29.46-centimeter) screen, the new Chromebook's 
have a larger display than tablets selling in the same price range, and also boast a real keyboard.

The Chromebook is a very different type of machine - and Google's biggest issue will be whether it can easily explain how it works to consumers.

Once the earnings slipped out, some reporters bolted from the
 laptop presentation to focus on numbers that disappointed investors.

Google Inc. appears to be trying to beat Microsoft and Apple to the punch with the discount Chromebook.

Microsoft is poised to release Windows 8, a dramatic makeover of its famous operating system, on Oct. 26.

The long-awaited makeover is designed to run on touch-based tablets, as well as laptop and desktop computers.

A variety of manufacturers will be selling a hodgepodge of Windows 8-powered personal computers and tablets.

Apple says it plans to show off a new product Tuesday.

The event is widely expected to be the coming-out party for a slightly smaller version of its hot-selling iPad.

The mini iPad is expected to feature a 7.85-inch (19.94-centimeter) screen compared to the nearly 10-inch (25.4-centimeter) screen of the pioneering iPad.

Industry analysts expect Apple to price a smaller iPad in the $249 to $299 range in an effort to siphon sales away from other scaled-down tablets, such as Google's Nexus 7 and Amazon.com Inc.'s Kindle Fire.
