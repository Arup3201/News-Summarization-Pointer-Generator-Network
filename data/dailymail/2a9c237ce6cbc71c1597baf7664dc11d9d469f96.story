Two friends have circumnavigated the globe in 80 days – recreating the fictional journey made by Phileas Fogg.

But Milan Bihlmann and Muammer Yilmaz’s adventure was made even more extraordinary given that they didn’t spend a penny of their own money completing the challenge.

After setting off from Paris on September 9, the pair managed to travel through countries including Austria, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, India, the US and Singapore by persuading travel companies to provide free train tickets and airfares.

They also managed to hitchhike between destinations and were offered free accommodation by strangers they met along the way.

On one occasion, a businessman in Calcutta agreed to pay for flights to Bangkok after reading about their story in a local newspaper.

The men first met in Berlin in December 2010 when Milan offered to host Muammer on the hospitality network Couchsurfing.com.

During the three days they were together on that occasion, they talked about undertaking a round-the-world trip together.

Milan, from Germany, has trained in international business and has also worked as a professional juggler. He is now studying for a degree in Business Administration at the Berlin School of Economy and Law.

Muammer, 39, is a French photographer and producer and is a passionate traveller.

Overall the trip covered nearly 12,500 miles, working out at roughly 155 miles per day.

After leaving France, they travelled through Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Turkey, Armenia, Iran, Pakistan, India, Burma, and then to Singapore.

From there they visited San Francisco and New York, before returning to Paris.

At one stage they were stranded in Calcutta, before a local man contacted them through their Facebook page offering to support the next part of their journey and pay for their plane tickets to Thailand.

The duo’s benefactor, Amit Saraogi, a businessman who works for poultry feed manufacturer Anmol Feeds, read about them in a newspaper article and invited them for dinner at his home.

‘At first, after reading the newspaper article, I was curious about these two men who had actually embarked on such a tour,’ said Saraogi.

‘When I went through their website and sent them a message on Facebook, I didn’t even know they if they were online and if the message would reach them.’

Just two hours later they were sitting in Mr Saraogi’s office.

‘We rushed to my residence in Alipore, where I introduced Milan and Muammer to my wife Dipali and daughters Nandini and Bhoomi, both students of La Martiniere. 

'For dinner, there were chapattis with dal, alu dahi ki sabzi and a preparation of cabbage. The two tasted a little of everything,’ said Mr Saraogi.

San Francisco: The two friends succeeded in circumnavigating the globe in 80 days

‘They just wanted to know from me why I was helping them. They smiled when I said I was fortunate to be in a position to do so and sincerely wished their success in the adventure.’

While travelling through Europe has proved relatively smooth, they faced problems when they tried to enter Iran as Milan was not eligible for visa on arrival because of his status as a German national.

They had to wait for seven days, almost 10 per cent of their target of 80 days, at the Turkey-Iran border while the visa application was processed.
