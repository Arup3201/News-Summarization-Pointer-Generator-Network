Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to be fit for Real Madrid's Champions League final showdown against Atletico on Saturday, manager Carlo Ancelotti has revealed.

The Portugal international, who has not played since being withdrawn through injury during Real's 1-1 draw with Valladolid on May 7, was set to face Espanyol in his side's final La Liga game of the season last weekend, but was removed from the squad as a precaution after feeling discomfort during the warm-up.

However, despite worries over fitness, Ronaldo trained in Lisbon with the rest of his Madrid team-mates on Friday and doesn't appear to have any problems as Real look to claim their 10th European Cup.

'Today’s session is very important. I 
think Cristiano doesn’t have problems. He has trained well,' said 
Ancelotti at a press conference on Friday evening.

Ronaldo broke the record for goals scored in a single season of Europe's elite competition this term and Ancelotti is fully aware of the threat the former Manchester United can pose against Real's local rivals.'He is a very important weapon. We need him. His statistics are there for all to see. He has played an excellent CL season, scored 16 goals and helped the team to reach this final,' said the Italian.

'I’m most worried about the unpredictable. Anything can happen in a final. There’s nothing you can do about that. You only work with what you can foresee.'

Despite
 Ronaldo's progress, Ancelotti admits Real will have to evaluate the 
fitness of defender Pepe - who was pictured receiving treatment during Friday's training session - and French striker Karim Benzema ahead of 
Saturday's match in the Portuguese capital.

'We will have to see how Pepe and Karim are because they haven’t trained this week. We will see how they train and make the decision for tomorrow,' said Ancelotti.

While
 Ronaldo is fit and ready, Atletico Madrid frontman Diego Costa was able
 to run freely during a light training session amid fears his hamstring 
injury could rule him out of the final.

Atleti manager Diego Simeone also revealed Arda Turan will be given a chance to prove his fitness.

However, Real defender Sergio Ramos isn't worried at the prospect of having to face the Spain international on Saturday.

Asked about Costa and Turan's potential comebacks, Ramos replied: 'It’s
 the same to me. What concerns me is Karim, Pepe, Cris, who have had 
injuries in the past few days. That’s what we’re concerned about.'

'We’re awaiting what might happen. For these finals we’d like to play the best. If Costa and Arda are there, no problem.'
