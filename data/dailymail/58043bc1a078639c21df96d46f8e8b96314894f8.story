Cristiano Ronaldo’s multi-million pound return to Old Trafford at the end of this season is a scenario that potentially suits everyone: Real Madrid get a large part of their £80million outlay on the player they bought in 2009 back; Ronaldo gets to be the returning hero; and the Glazers get to put right one of their biggest regrets as Manchester United owners – letting their prize asset leave the club.

What none of the parties involved will do just now, is admit it’s a possibility.

Real Madrid have lost two of their opening three games of the season and the president, Florentino Perez, is under pressure – the last message he needs to be sending out is that at the end of the campaign he will sell a player who after just five seasons already has club legend Raul’s all-time top goalscorer record in his sights.

Ronaldo likewise will not want to be seen to be the bad guy agitating for a move. He is happy in the Spanish capital playing for a manager he likes and with a group of players whose company he enjoys. 

Angel di Maria was a friend but best pal Fabio Coentrao is still at the club and Gareth Bale is also now part of the former United man’s inner circle.

Real Madrid (2009- ) 

Appearances: 251 Goals: 256

Major honours: 1 LA Liga, 1 Champions League, 1 UEFA Super Cup, 2 Copa Del Reys

Manchester United (2003- 2009) Appearances: 292 Goals: 118

Major honours: 3 Premier League titles, 1 Champions League, 1 FIFA Club World Cup, 1 FA Cup, 2 League Cups  

But still, in spite of that contentment in Spain, there is a doubt. Real remain an instable club – perhaps the only club in the world that would respond to winning the Champions League by selling two of its best players. The summer transfer activity did not entirely please Ronaldo and he made sure people knew it.

'If I was in charge I would have done things differently,’ he said. That was a slap around the face for a president who just a year earlier had made Ronaldo the highest paid player in the club’s history.

Perez said publicly several days later that he in no way saw it as a show of dissent but there was really no other way to see it and the quote will come back to haunt both men if the season does not go well for Real Madrid.

Doing his best to pour a little gasoline over the smoldering flames was former Real president Ramon Calderon on Monday, when he said he believed a Ronaldo return to Old Trafford was possible.

‘My impression is he is fed up with the policy of the current president,’ said Calderon of his sworn enemy Perez. ‘When he came to Real Madrid with [Arjen] Robben he thought he would be a good colleague for him in the team but then he was sold. 

‘[Gonzalo] Higuain was sold and he didn’t like that. Last year he thought it was a mistake to let [Mesut] Ozil leave and the last straw was selling Xabi Alonso and Angel di Maria this summer,’ he went on.

Some of Calderon’s comments are fanciful. Ronaldo was not disappointed that Robben was sold in 2009, he was too busy being delighted about taking his place in the team. 

And any disappointment at Ozil leaving last year soon evaporated as Bale came in and helped Ronaldo win another European Cup. Neither was he particularly close to Alonso to be too fussed by his departure but after his years spent in the secure bosom of Old Trafford where Sir Alex Ferguson built and rebuilt his squad with care, he has been somewhat dismayed by the ripping apart of last season’s European champions.

Ronaldo could link up with old friend Di Maria once more if he returned to Manchester United

He also shares an agent – Jorge Mendes – with Radamel Falcao, who he feels should have been signed in the summer, and Di Maria who he would have liked to have seen stay.

He would be reunited with both at Old Trafford if he returns, providing Falcao is kept on beyond his initial season-long loan deal. That might be another card that United can play at the end of this season. They might also remind Ronaldo that United fans have never stopped singing his name. 

At Real Madrid he is now the adored talisman he feels he always should have been but he has had to fight hard for the adulation and the jeers and whistles for Iker Casillas at the weekend will have reminded him that this club does not always appreciate its legends. The Real keeper has been at the club for 15 years but that has not stopped the boo-boys demanding he be dropped.

There would be hero worship at Old Trafford, a reunion with Di Maria and with Rooney and if Perez can get his money back on Ronaldo and swoop for several stars – it will take a least two huge new signings to appease the fans if Ronaldo is sold – then maybe, just maybe it can happen.

For now, however, everyone at Real Madrid will go on pretending it is out of the question. Too much is at stake for them to say anything else.

I love Manchester. Everyone knows that — I have said it many times. Manchester is in my heart. I left many good friends there, the supporters are amazing and I wish I can come back one day. I am happy here in Real Madrid and have four more years, but in the future you never know because they treated me unbelievably there.

Cristiano Ronaldo opens up in an interview with the Daily Mail (2014)

I loved it there, I was 18 years old, I win everything there, the people treat me like a god there so I appreciate and the future nobody know. It’s crazy that they still sing my name. I’ll not forget it so I appreciate it a lot. I love Manchester, to be back, I never know, you never know, football you never know. Of course I’m happy at Real Madrid. It’s my home, it’s my club but Manchester treat me unbelievable so we never know.

Ronaldo in an interview with MUTV (2014)

I did think about United. They are still in my heart. It is a club where I played for six years and I love that club. I have a lot of friends there and I wish them all the best
