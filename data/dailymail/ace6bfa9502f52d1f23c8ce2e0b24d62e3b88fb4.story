Having made a series of outrageous claims about various royals over the years, aristocratic author Lady Colin Campbell is not afraid of controversy.

The eccentric writer provoked a storm of criticism when she asserted that Princess Diana had had an affair with King Juan Carlos of Spain.

Then last month she surpassed herself with claims that the Queen Mother was the daughter of her family’s French cook.

Mother and baby: The Queen Mother, then the Duchess of York, holds the cheerful child who would grow up to become Queen Elizabeth II. A controversial new biography purports to tell the 'untold story' of her life

Yesterday, she somehow managed to 
trump that – by declaring that the Queen and Princess Margaret were 
conceived by artificial insemination.

Lady Campbell said it was ‘well known 
in royal circles’ that the Queen Mother ‘didn’t do sex’ and ‘left that 
side of things’ to King George VI’s alleged mistress.

Unsurprisingly, the claims in her book
 ‘The Untold Life of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother’ – to be published
 this month – were immediately derided.

'Gossip masquerading as history': Lady Colin Campbell (right) made the claims at the launch of her new biography of the Queen Mother in London. Experts on the Royal Family dismissed them as 'lies' and 'fiction'

One respected royal author said the 
book was ‘best read as a work of fiction’. Hugo Vickers also attacked 
Lady Campbell for announcing its publication on the tenth anniversary of
 the Queen Mother’s death.

In the book, she writes that the Queen
 Mother did not enjoy sex with King George VI – whose nickname was 
Bertie – and so agreed to be artificially inseminated with his sperm by a
 trusted doctor.

Lady Campbell, 62, who is divorced 
from Lord Colin Campbell but continues to use her title, added: ‘They 
needed to produce an heir. If Elizabeth would not allow Bertie to 
impregnate her naturally, they had to find the means of impregnating her
 unnaturally...

Under fire: The latest allegations about the Queen and her mother follow Lady Colin's claim that the Queen Mother was born to a French surrogate mother who worked as a royal cook

‘There was only one course of action. 
Artificial insemination had the merit of accommodating both Bertie and 
Elizabeth’s needs, insofar as the conception of a legitimate heir to the
 throne was concerned.’

She claims the Queen Mother went to a 
doctor who inseminated her with Bertie’s sperm and she then became 
pregnant with the couple’s first child.

The girl was born in April 1926 
and went on to become Queen Elizabeth II. Her sister, Princess Margaret,
 was born in August 1930.

'Grandiose claims': The biographer alleges King George IV and the Queen Mother resorted to artificial insemination to conceive the Queen, pictured as a baby in 1926

At a press conference yesterday, the 
Jamaican-born socialite said: ‘The Duke of Windsor (King George’s 
brother) had been told by his brother that Elizabeth preferred not to 
partake of certain aspects of marital life, which he accepted, but they 
needed children.

‘The two girls were their mother and 
father’s progeny but were conceived by artificial insemination. In 
aristocratic and royal circles, it was known that Elizabeth did not do 
sex.’

But Mr Vickers said she had no evidence to support her claims.

He said: ‘It’s all based on gossip and
 hearsay. This book is best read as a work of fiction and it shouldn’t 
be taken seriously.’

Lady Campbell claims the sources for 
her information are ‘legion’. She said they included the Duke of Windsor
 and Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, but historians including Mr Vickers 
cast doubt on this, questioning whether she had in fact ever met the 
Duke of Windsor and describing Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, as an 
unreliable source.

In the book, Lady Campbell also 
describes the Queen Mother as a ‘tough old biddy’, adding: ‘I think the 
blue rinse brigade will be absolutely horrified that I’ve actually had 
the temerity to say the Queen Mother wasn’t a goddess.’ She said she 
realised her book, which she described as ‘uncomfortable’ for the Royal 
Family, would shock some, but pointed to the fact she’d been proved 
right in the past.

Lady Campbell was the first writer to identify Princess Diana’s battle with bulimia and her affair with James Hewitt.

Speaking about the disputed claim that
 the Queen Mother was the daughter of the family cook, she said the Duke
 of Windsor had told her he had seen various documents supporting the 
claim.

She said they showed that the cook, an
 ‘attractive Frenchwoman’ named Marguerite Rodiere, gave birth to the 
future Queen Elizabeth because her own mother Cecilia, who already had 
eight children, was unable to have any more.

Lady Campbell also claims the Queen 
Mother engineered her brother-in-law’s abdication from the throne. 
Edward VIII, Bertie’s brother, stepped down in 1936 because of his 
desire to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson.

She said: ‘The Duke of Windsor said it
 was an absolute lie that he didn’t want to sit on the throne...Did 
Elizabeth and her cronies assist in shoving him off the throne? Her 
cronies certainly did, the only debate is whether she did.’

She also suggests the Queen Mother had
 an affair with Leon Blum, the  former French prime minister. But she 
said she did not personally believe this to be the case.
