From Batman to Shrek and even Superman, films have become an increasingly popular source of inspiration for brides in search of an unusual wedding theme.

But one Harry Potter aficionado has taken things a step further, combining an homage to the boy wizard with a play on Star Wars - her groom's film of choice.

As a result, invitations to the wedding enjoyed by Victoria Maclean-Price and her new husband, Adam Maclean, both 34, last weekend came in the shape of Hogwarts' acceptance letters while the cake was decorated with an AT-AT walker.

Many of the decorations were handmade and thanks to the quality of her magical handiwork, newlywed Victoria, from Tonna in South Wales, has been offered the chance to turn her hobby into a business.

Speaking about her unusual wedding, Mrs Maclean-Price said: 'While planning the wedding with one of my bridesmaids, she told me to make sure that we put our own personal stamp on our wedding day.

'I am the Harry Potter fan and Adam is the Star Wars fan, so what better way to make it our day, then to have these two films as the theme for our big day. It was the most perfect combination: the best of both worlds.'

According to Mrs Maclean-Price, the unusual choice of theme came about after she fell in love with the Harry Potter books.

'I love that Harry never gave up no matter how much he lost,' she said. 'I love that he was a fighter, and cared about all his friends like family. Everything he does he does as a fighter.'

So devoted to Potter is Mrs Maclean-Price, she even named her four-year-old son Harry after the boy wizard and involved him in creating props for the wedding, among them, a pensieve.

'My little boy Harry helped me make the bowl. He sat there and made the papier-mâché. I just love doing it.

'I used to make jewellery years ago, but it was not challenging enough for me. I love making things that people say "you can't make that". I like to go against what people say.'

After spending months creating a variety of unusual props, among them a 12ft Christmas Tree, the 34-year-old says she couldn't have been happier with the results.

'I was nervous at first, but once I walked down the aisle carrying my son with my amazingly handsome husband-to-be in front of me, I just felt so calm and happy,' she explained.

'Even though the weather outside was terrible, all our guests were loving every second of the day, and it was just the most amazing feeling to be in that room celebrating with them.'

In keeping with their passion for all things magical, the pair even managed to unearth a photographer who moonlights as a magician, and who spent the rest of the wedding entertaining guests with tricks.

Even the stars aligned for them on their big day as the photographer they hired also moon-lighted as a magician, and spent the rest of the night doing tricks.

After the wedding at St Anne's Church in Tonna, the couple and their guests decamped to Bar Gallois in Port Talbot, where both staff and attendees were thrilled by the magical set-up.

'The guests were completely amazed,' revealed Mrs Maclean-Price. 'The venue emailed me afterwards and said they loved it. It was amazing - the perfect day.'

Following her unusual wedding, Mrs Maclean-Price is now embarking on a new career as a set designer which she hopes will allow her to indulge in her love of prop-making while making some money from it.

'Currently I'm doing some props for a burlesque show and I would like to work for stage, TV or film,' she revealed.

'It's very exciting for me. This is my passion and I just love being in the studio alone working away. I will do whatever. I am also doing some big Greek columns for theatre. I have been told they are quite sought after.

'The only thing is that it is just me and I would like to expand if it does take off.'

And she has already been given a helping hand towards achieving her goal in the shape of a sponsorship at the Revue Studios in Swansea.Business owner Stacey Adamiec, who decided to offer her the award, said: 'Victoria is a natural at prop making, and is one of the only in the area.

'I would like to provide the opportunity to see her develop this as a business not just a hobby, especially with the continuous growth in the South Wales creative industry where there is a huge demand for Victoria's skills in stage, film and TV.'
