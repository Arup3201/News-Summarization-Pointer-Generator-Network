Hermann Gerdau was a gunner aboard the Nazi battleship Schleswig Holstein when it opened fire on a Polish base - 55 minutes before Hitler said the war started

The German gunner who fired the first shots of the Second World War claims the conflict began 55 minutes than Hitler claimed.

Hermann Gerdau, now 100 years old, was a 
gunner aboard the Nazi battleship Schleswig Holstein whose big guns 
opened up on Poland in the early hours of September 1 1939.

Speaking for the first time of his part in the conflict he said: 'Hitler told the world that the bombardment began at 5.45am, but this was untrue.

'It began at 4.50am. I know because I was there.'

It was the first of the many thousands of lies Hitler would tell the German people throughout the conflict.

Gerdau, now a resident of an OAP home near Hamburg, was 26 on the morning the world changed forever. 

He said: 'We knew nothing of Hitler's war plans, but  immediately before the invasion of Poland, strange things happened.

'At night we took 225 marine infantry, machine guns and ammunition on board a feeder ship and early the next morning came the order to open fire on the Westerplatte Polish naval base that was only 500 metres away from us.

'The call to battle stations came and I jumped out of the hammock and ran to my post.  We fired the first shots of the war.  We were so close it was impossible to miss.

'I was bound up in the euphoria of victory.  We were all seized by the Nazi regime.  But I was not enthusiastic about the war in general. And soon there was only horror.'

He lost countless comrades in the battles
to come. Some 800 men from the Schleswig-Holstein - which was sunk by 
British bombs in 1944 - were transferred in 1941 to the battleship 
Bismarck, which was sunk with the loss of nearly all hands in May that 
year.

'I was lucky that I was not aboard,' said Gerdau.  'I had just completed a training course and missed the transfer.'

Instead he was transferred to U-Boats which suffered 80 percent fatality rates. He was awarded the Iron Cross First Class in 1943 for his actions against Allied convoys in the North Atlantic - but had grown totally disillusioned with the war by then.

He added: 'So many ships were sunk. The 
war was lost.  But you couldn't discuss it; you never knew if the next 
person was a devil of the Nazis.

These were the lost years when a whole generation were burned by the Nazis.....'

He was captured in 1945 and imprisoned, first in the UK and then in America.  After returning to Germany he worked on coalers and a whaling ship before becoming a captain.

His wife Alwina died in 2001, and he lost his son in 1986.  Now the last survivor the Schleswig Holstein he had this advice for the younger generation: 'To avoid war, learn.  Education is everything.  Go to school. And don't forget to vote.'
