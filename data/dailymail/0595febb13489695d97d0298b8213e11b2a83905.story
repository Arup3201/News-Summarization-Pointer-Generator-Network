Conman Gary Sheehy (pictured) deceived Lee Mackie into investing £4,350 of the money she received after her son Jason was blown up by an improvised explosive device in a camping equipment business

This is the conman who tricked a Royal Marine's mother out of the life insurance payout she receieved when her son was killed in Afghanistan by persuading her to invest in his failing business.

Gary Sheehy deceived Lee Mackie into investing £4,350 of the money she received after her son Jason was blown up by an improvised explosive device in a camping equipment business, promising her she would double her money within two years.

Although the enterprise did exist, 
Sheehy, 50, lied to her about its success, claiming thousands of orders 
were in the pipeline when in fact it was failing.

After months of evading calls and excuses, Ms Mackie, 58, reported Sheehy, her neighbour’s boyfriend, to the police.

However, Sheehy was spared an immediate prison term today and was handed a nine-month prison sentence, suspended for two years.

He was ordered to pay back £2,000 of the money after he admitted the fraud at an earlier hearing.

Oxford Crown Court was told that Ms Mackie had received around £60,000 in life insurance after 21-year-old Jason, who served with 3rd Armoured Support Group, was killed in 2009.

Sheehy befriended her as his partner was Ms Mackie’s next-door neighbour in Bampton, Oxfordshire.

Patrick Moran, prosecuting,told the court: 'He went on to abuse that friendship and the trust 
placed in him by Ms Mackie and he did so at a time when she was 
vulnerable.'

In June 
2010 Ms Mackie gave £10,000 to Sheehy to set up a motor vehicle 
sales business. The business failed but there were no criminal charges 
brought against Sheehy for the money given to him.

In October that year he asked her for another £3,500 for the camping equipment firm.

He told Ms Mackie the equipment was already in production and that 140,000 units had been ordered.

'In fact the device was never in production and no orders had been placed for it,' said Mr Moran.

A few months later Sheehy asked her for another £850.

Ms
 Mackie thought this was another investment, however, it was needed to repay one of Sheehy's customers in York who he had sold faulty equipment to.

Mr Moran said it was clear Sheehy was willing to 'behave recklessly' with other people’s money.

Peter De Feu, mitigating, said Sheehy had not intended to defraud Ms Mackie.

'It is a business that, if it had worked, would have made her a lot of money,' he said.

'It may be that the defendant wasn’t entirely open with Ms Mackie as to how badly it failed.

'He was desperately trying to keep what he thought was a brilliant idea on the road and so misled her.'

The
 court heard that Sheehy lives with two women in separate houses, one of
 whom he has two children with, one aged three and the other eight months, and that he provides for them both financially.

Mr
 De Feu said Sheehy had set up a new car trading business and was 
'absolutely determined' to pay back every penny Ms Mackie had given him, including the £10,000 from the vehicle business.

'With
 the plates that he’s spinning, the efforts that he’s making to keep 
those households going, any loss of liberty would have devastating 
effects,' Mr De Feu told the court.

Wearing
 a grey suit, pink shirt and purple tie, Sheehy, who has diabetes, 
appeared emotionless as the details of the case were read out.

Sentencing Sheehy, Judge Ian Pringle said: 'You can imagine 
the effect that has had on her.

'She feels betrayed by your actions.'

However,
 the judge said he was satisfied the act was 'totally out of character' 
for Sheehy, adding: 'I’m prepared therefore to be more lenient than I 
otherwise would have been.'

After
 handing him a suspended sentence, Judge Pringle said: 'Be under no 
illusion, if you do get into trouble that sentence of nine months is 
likely to be implemented in full.'

Following the hearing, Ms Mackie said she was 'not surprised' that Sheehy had escaped an immediate prison sentence.

'I still struggle to put it into words - it was the most devastating thing that has ever happened in my life. People say time makes it better but it doesn’t,' she said of her son's death.

'Of course I think he should have gone to prison but I didn’t think it was going to happen.

'To have got him put inside would have been the cherry on top of the cake.'

Ms Mackie said she was 'seriously chuffed' that Sheehy will have to do 120 hours of unpaid work but was doubtful that he would fulfil his pledge to repay both the £4,350 she gave him for the camping business, and the other £10,000.

Vulnerable: Ms Mackie said she felt guilt that she had 'blown' the money which had cost her son his life

'He’s not a con artist for nothing,' said Ms Mackie.

'He can talk himself out of anything.'

Of the fraud, Ms Mackie said: 'I was furious, because of where the money had come from.

'I had this huge guilt that I had blown this money which cost my child his life,” she said.

'I suddenly got this huge anxiety and guilt about using the money and being taken for a ride.

'I was so scared I couldn’t even tell my other two sons. I am not a stupid person but because I was so vulnerable I allowed this man to con me into giving it to him.'
