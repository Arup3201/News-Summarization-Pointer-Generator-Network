The New York City Council has passed a bill lowering the maximum speed limit from 30mph to 25 mph.

The change is part of Mayor Bill de Blasio's effort to cut down on pedestrian deaths, which have rocketed up by 15 per cent in recent years. 

It will come into effect  on November 7, applying to all streets where a maximum speed is not posted, which amounts to around 90 per cent of the city. 

Slowing down: Bill de Blasio announced that 90 per cent of New York City's streets will have a 25mph limit

De Blasio's 'Vision Zero' initiative aims to eliminate traffic fatalities with 63 proposed law changes.

Pedestrians have double the chance of survival if hit by a car going just five miles per hour slower than the current speed limit, studies claim. 

Flanked by tearful families of car crash victims, de Blasio said: 'Families and children will be safer because of what we're doing here today. 

'Lowering the speed limit will save lives. 

'This is a major step toward achieving Vision Zero, and it depends on every New Yorker taking personal responsibility and putting the lives of their neighbors first.'

The council vote, with 44 for the motion, came on Tuesday.

It is the first time in more than 50 years the council has voted to drop the speed limit.

Backing the campaign, Meera Joshi, chair of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, said: 'The 25 mph speed limit will benefit taxi and other for-hire drivers in a number of ways.

'First, it will create a safer work environment for them all, but it will also help both passengers and drivers understand our shared responsibility of putting an end to traffic deaths and injuries.' 

She added: 'Passengers - please tip for safety and not speed!' 

The bill-signing was held on the corner of Delancy and Clinton Streets on Manhattan’s Lower East Side, where 12-year-old Dashane Santana was killed by a car in 2012.
