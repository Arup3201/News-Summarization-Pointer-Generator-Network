Dallas Wiens and Jamie Nash both suffered horrific and unimaginable injuries that would change their lives forever - because it brought the self-confessed soulmates together.

The couple, from Texas, got married recently in an emotional ceremony at the very same church where Dallas suffered a freak accident that almost killed him.

He said: 'It's where I was injured, it's where I was reborn . It's where the greatest part of my life will begin. We're going back to start over.'

The 28-year-old was 
severely injured in a bizarre construction accident in 2008 when he came
into contact with a high-voltage power line.

His entire face was burned off and he later became the first full face transplant patient in the U.S., receiving a new nose, lips, skin, muscle and nerves from an anonymous donor.

About 200 people attended the wedding at Ridglea Baptist Church, including doctors and nurses who had treated the couple

Jamie Nash, of Garland, nearly died in a
car crash in Ennis in 2010. Her car erupted in flames, and she was 
trapped. She was severely burned on her hands, back and legs. She still cannot lift her arms the whole way or have full use her hands.

Despite these injuries - and because of them - the couple were able to find each other.

'It was providence. She is my beloved, my soul mate,' Dallas told People magazine.

The couple met when Dallas spoke to a
group of burn patients at Parkland Hospital. Jamie said that as soon as
he walked in she was intrigued.

'The way he sauntered in. I'm looking
at my scars thinking, "I don't know if I could deal with something 
happening my face",' she told People magazine.

His facial features were burned away and he was left blind after his head touched a high-voltage power line while painting the Ridglea Baptist Church in November 2008.

First dance: Wiens, who became the first in the nation to receive a full face transplant recipient after a 2008 power line accident, says Nash is his soulmate

She reached out to him soon after and
though Dallas had sworn off love, he responded to her text. Two weeks 
later they went out to dinner at Applebees. After that, the pair became 
inseparable.

Jamie told People: 'His
heart really shone through. First I fell in love with him emotionally 
and then physically. I always thought he was handsome.'

She was self-conscious about her 
scars and worried about what Dallas would think. But because he  lost 
his sight in the accident, it made things a little easier.

But he thought she was beautiful and 
reassured her about her burns - so much so that on their wedding day on 
March 31, she wore an off the shoulder dress with a plunging back line which showed off her scars.

'I'm not ashamed of them, they are part of me,' she told People. 'He makes me feel like I am the most beautiful person in the world, I just love him so much.

'After I have a surgery and I'm in so much
pain the depression sets in. He holds me and lets me cry and then he 
says something to make me laugh.'

Dallas told People he wouldn't take back his old face if he could. 'It was worthless, my life was empty. Now I'm happy. I'm satisfied.

'I've got Jamie. I'm grateful, everything I have
been through has made me into the man I am today.'

The couple met in a support group for burn victims and started dating shortly after, they soon became inseparable

On their wedding day, Wiens was walked down the aisle with his grandfather, Del Peterson of Fort Worth.

A retired banker, Peterson accompanied Dallas through much of his recovery, including multiple flights to Boston.

‘He’s
marrying someone who can share about their pain that they’ve gone 
through, and their recoveries,’ said Sue Peterson, Del’s wife. Until 
recently, Wiens lived with the Petersons.

‘They have fantastic attitudes about why they’re where they are.’

Escorted
by her father, Nash wore a chiffon gown with a pink-lace bodice, 
off-shoulder sleeves and a plunging back that revealed the scars from 
her accident.

‘Things 
happened that I didn’t think ever could be possible for me, and you made
them possible,’ Nash said. ‘You gave me hope, and you gave me tender 
love that I will always treasure.’

The
wedding was followed by a reception at the Flying Saucer in downtown 
Fort Worth, where the couple made their entrance to Bruno Mars’ hit Just
the Way You Are.

Dallas said he wouldn't take back his old face if he could: 'It was worthless, my life was empty. Now I'm happy. I'm satisfied. I've got Jamie. I'm grateful, everything I have been through has made me into the man I am today'

All in the past: The couple tied the knot at the Ridglea Baptist Church in Fort Worth, where Wiens' horrific electrical accident took place four years ago

The couple plans to put their pasts behind them.

'There's no reason to dwell on the past,' he said.

'It's dead and gone,' she added. 'It burned in the fire.'

They said they make the perfect couple and help balance each other.

Her hands, for example, were severely injured in her accident. His are fine.

She can see. He lost his eyesight in the accident.

'It's a story of hope, a story of 
true survivors,' Nash said. 'I mean, if we can do it, I guarantee you, 
anybody out there - we all have a story.

'We're all going through 
something. And I want to give everybody hope.'
