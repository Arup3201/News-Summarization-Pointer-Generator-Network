Kostas Stafylidis can help Fulham banish the memories of last season’s Greek tragedy.

The marauding left-back, picked up by Felix Magath on loan from Bayer Leverkusen, was the star of the show for the Championship side at League One Crawley.

And the impressive display of Stafylidis, 20, was in stark contrast to record signing and £12.4million flop Konstantinos Mitroglou last season.

Plagued by injuries World Cup misfit Mitroglou made little contribution as Fulham slumped out of the Premier League - and now seems certain to leave.

But playing almost as a left winger compatriot Stafylidis cracked in a 20-yard angled drive for the opener and then teed up Colombian striker Hugo Rodallega for the second.

Scotland assistant boss Mark McGhee, once tipped to team up with Magath, arrived to check on Fulham’s £11m man Ross McCormack – but was left disappointed.

The 27-year-old international, short of match fitness after missing out on a full pre-season following his move from Leeds, did not feature.

Veteran Danish keeper Brian Jensen, known as ‘The Beast’ and signed this summer by Crawley boss John Gregory, pulled off smart saves to deny Rodallega and Lasse Vigen Christiansen.

One of Crawley’s 13 summer arrivals Izale McLeod should have scored after 23 minutes, the striker putting a free header wide.

And shortly after just past the half-hour Stafylidis beat Jensen before two minutes later setting up Rodallega for a simple finish from five yards.

On the hour Crawley gave a run-out to triallist and former Fulham Premier League forward Collins John.

And the only scare for Fulham was a crunching challenge from Red Devils’ midfielder Jimmy Smith on playmaker Chris David, who limped off shortly after.
