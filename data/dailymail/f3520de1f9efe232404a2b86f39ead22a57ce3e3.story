Part of a Sydney home had to be torn down on Thursday so paramedics could remove a man weighing more than 300kg in need of urgent medical attention.

More than 20 rescue workers were called to the Croydon Park home to remove the 36-year-old man's front window because he was too large to fit through the front door.

The operation to remove the man took three hours and involved putting black plastic on a ramp sloping out of the hole in the wall and 'sliding him out on his back', according to neighbours.

A relative of the home's landlord said he had only seen the man once in the lounge room of the house.

'He was across the whole sofa lounge, a three person lounge,' he told Mailonline.

'His shoulder was at one end and his feet at the other. He took up the whole lounge.'

He said the man and his family had been living in the house for between two and three years and were public housing tenants.

The man weighs between 300kg and 400kg but a NSW Ambulance spokeswoman refused to confirm his exact weight.

The man was suffering chest pains and had preexisting medical conditions so he needed to go to hospital for emergency treatment.

The man called paramedics to help him get to hospital and when they arrived extra fire and rescue workers were brought in to help, at around 11am. The operation concluded at about 2pm.

The special ambulance used to remove the man is called a bariatric truck, some of which have a hydraulic lifter to hoist patients into the back.

The truck is also called a multi purpose vehicle which paramedics nickname the 'massive person vehicle' , or simply call it 'the fat truck'.

NSW has around six fat trucks which operate throughout the state.

A neighbour said he had last seen the obese man 18 months ago, but said he 'never left the house'.

'He's always sitting in a chair in the hallway or the doorway. He never came out,' he said.

Another neighbour who didn't want to be named said the house was the scene of a domestic incident at Christmas, which saw a man punch a hole in the wall.

Two people were pictured coming out the house on Thursday night after the man was removed and taken to a nearby hospital

The obese man lived with an older man, a woman in her 30s, another young man in his 20s and a boy believed to be under 10

The man's family, who did not go to hospital, declined to talk to the Daily Mail Australia when approached today.

The obese man lived with an older man, a woman in her 30s, another young man in his 20s and a boy believed to be under 10.

Neighbours said they were a quiet family who had only moved into the area in the last two years.

A Fire and Rescue NSW spokeswoman said five crews - or about 20 workers - attended the scene.

He was moved out of the house on a ramp, which was built sloping out of the house's front bedroom window.

Another ramp was built up into the ambulance.

An Urban Search and Rescue semi trailer was brought to the scene to assist with the rescue.

Rescue workers were forced to wear protective overalls and respiratory gear because the house contained asbestos.
