An Indian yoga guru leading a nationwide campaign against corruption is coming under increasing scrutiny over his own alleged financial irregularities.

Baba Ramdev has millions of supporters and his daily TV programme is watched across India. Last June he held a nine-day anti-corruption hunger strike in Delhi before police evicted him.

Yesterday, he was arrested on suspicion of violating prohibitory orders after calling for the removal of India's Congress party from its ruling coalition government at another protest against corruption near the country's parliament. He was later released.

Under investigation: Baba Ramdev has millions of supporters and his daily TV programme is watched by millions across India. But organisations he is linked to are under investigation

At the start of his protest walk, which was attended by thousands of supporters, he said: 'Remove the Congress party and save the nation.'

But while the star, who is known for sitting in the lotus position and performing breathing exercises on his show,  has embarked on a collision course with the Congress-led UPA government, organisations linked to him have come under investigation.

A note prepared by the Directorate General of Central Excise Intelligence in July 2012 reveals charges were made against Ramdev's Patanjali Yog Peeth Trust at Haridwar in Uttarakhand as well as other organisations linked with him with financial irregularities.

The DGCEI conducted a special audit and identified six major areas of investigation, the first being the overriding powers Ramdev has been accorded in the trust deed of PYPT.

Also under the scanner is a 'donation', ranging from '11,000 to 11 lakh', received by the trust from corporate members for services rendered through yoga camps.

This, the DGCEI noted, was in the nature of fees and not donation.

The tax sleuths have also called into question the huge tract of land the PYPT possesses on the basis of unregistered documents, the trust's activities outside India - being carried out without obtaining any general or special order from the Central Board of Direct Taxes, and its 'illegal activity'.

The DGCEI also observed that while the Vanprastha Scheme applicants paid money to enjoy lifelong residence in cottages, the amounts shelled out did not qualify as donations because they were received in exchange for services rendered.

The primary focus of the special audit was on how money was being received by both PYPT and Divya Yog Mandir Trust to enable entities and individuals to participate in various schemes.

According to the authority, showing these amounts as donations was a direct evasion of service tax.

The note also disclosed that a showcause notice had been issued to PYPT by the additional director general, Delhi zonal unit, on April 24, 2012.

It demanded service tax totalling 4.94 crore for the period from October 1, 2006, to March 31, 2011. The document stated that the case was pending adjudication with the state of Meerut's central excise commissioner.

It added: 'The investigation revealed that PYPT is charging fees from participants in the name of donations wherein they send donation coupons printed by them to be sold at the local level.

'All the proceeds received from donation coupons are repatriated to PYPT. But the services provided by them are covered under "health and fitness services", which are defined under section 65 (51) and attract service tax under section 65 (105) of the Finance Act, 1994.'

DYMT was also put in the dock for earning rent from immovable property but not paying service tax.

The audit note said: '[It was only] after the initiation of the inquiry [that] they obtained registration and deposited service tax amounting to 19.78 lakh along with interest.'
