Truckloads of drinking water have been shipped to an eastern Montana city after residents started to complain that their tap water had begun to smell like diesel. 

The complaints followed an oil spill in the Yellowstone River last Saturday, which saw around 50,000 gallons of oil leak into the waterway from a break in a pipeline. 

The spill occurred about five miles upstream from Glendive, an agricultural community in east-central Montana near the North Dakota border.

Crews work to contain a 50,000-gallon oil spill after a pipeline leaked along the Yellowstone River near Glendive, Montana for an hour on Saturday 

Truckloads of drinking water were shipped to the city yesterday after residents complained of a foul smell coming from their tap water and tests showed traces of oil in the city's public water supplies 

Initial tests of Glendive water supplies on Saturday and Sunday revealed no evidence of oil but by late Sunday, residents began complaining that the water coming from their taps had an unusual smell, officials said.

Further tests to determine the scope of any contamination will be carried out with the results expected to be known in the coming days. About 6,000 people are served by the intake.

Officials stressed that they were bringing in the shipments of drinking water  as a precaution and did not know yet whether there was any health threat.

Still, an advisory against ingesting water from the city's treatment plant was issued late Monday. After hearing about it, Glendive resident Ed Miller, 67, picked up an extra gallon of water from the fast-dwindling supplies at a convenience store.

Miller said he hadn't noticed any odors from his own tap water. But his neighbors had, and Miller said he wouldn't be drinking any city water until the advisory was lifted.

Glendive City Councilman Gerald Reichert said he first noticed an odor in the water at his house Sunday night. He said it smelled like diesel fuel.

Bridger Pipeline spokesman Bill Salvin said Monday that the company is confident that no more than 1,200 barrels — or roughly 50,000 gallons — of oil spilled during the hour-long breach.

Clean-up workers cut holes into the ice on the Yellowstone River, hoping they can vacuum up crude as it comes down the river in the coming days. The ice has made it harder to spot any spilled oil

An oil sheen was seen near Sidney, almost 60 river miles downstream from Glendive, said Paul Peronard, the on-scene coordinator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 

Clean-up crews trying to recover the spilled crude were hampered by ice that covered most of the river, making it hard to find the oil. Booms were being placed in areas of open water to try and trap oil. 

Near Crane, which is about 30 miles downstream from the spill, crews were chopping holes into the ice in hopes that they will be able to vacuum up crude as it comes down the river in coming days.

'These are horrible working conditions to try to recover oil,' Peronard said Monday.

'Normally you at least see it, but you can't see it, you can't smell it. We're going to have to hunt and peck through ice to get it out.'

Bridger crews were still working on Monday to determine exactly where the breach occurred.

If it happened on the bank, some of the oil may be trapped in the soil near the river. If it was beneath the river, 'then it's all in the river,' Peronard said.

Montana Gov. Steve Bullock signed an executive order on Sunday declaring a state of emergency in the area. 

He toured the spill site Monday afternoon and said he expected Bridger to continue its clean-up efforts 'until it's cleaned up to our standards'.

'The water's a concern,' Bullock said. 'I expect Bridger to continue and provide all the resources needed.'

The Poplar Pipeline system runs from Canada to Baker, Montana, and carries crude oil from the Bakken oil-producing regions in Montana and North Dakota. The pipeline crosses the Yellowstone River near Glendive and is dug around eight feet into the river bed.

The pipeline, which was last inspected in 2012, remained shut Monday while crews planned to pump out any remaining oil from the section of the pipeline where the breach occurred.

Bridge Pipeline Vice President Tad True said the company apologizes for the spill and has taken responsibility for the clean-up.

The company will not be able to restart the pipeline until it receives approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. 

Inspectors from the federal agency were at the spill and also planned to inspect Bridger Pipeline's control room in Casper, Wyoming, to gather more information, PHMSA spokeswoman Susan Lagana said.
