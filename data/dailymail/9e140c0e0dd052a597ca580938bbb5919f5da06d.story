A senior NHS manager was sacked after she sent 'extreme' emails to her married lover that discussed her use of sex toys and suggesting a drunken romp on a desk, a tribunal heard.

She sent the stream of explicit notes from her work account at University College London Hospital, and her employers found out and dismissed her.

The manager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is claiming unfair dismissal and sex discrimination, despite sending emails about masturbating and even having a ‘treasure hunt’ on her breasts.

Sam Nicholls, for UCLH, said her actions were completely inappropriate, telling the tribunal: 'The emails talk of sex in what I would describe as extreme 
language. It is shocking. This is not a building site culture but this 
is a refined culture of an NHS trust.

'It’s not an invitation to coffee. It’s not an invitation for 
dinner, it’s not even ‘I love you’ - it goes far beyond that.'

The woman admitted the affair and emails to her boss last July after the man’s scorned wife threatened to turn up at UCLH for an angry showdown.

During a flurry of emails sent between her and the man on April 14 last year the woman suggested a boozy tryst in her office, saying: 'Want to meet? I’m very drunk. My office. Boss’s desk.'

Earlier on she had told the man of what she had spent the evening talking about, including ‘my attraction... my unhappiness and how to make a love affair last forever.’

She then added: ‘And on second bottle. And already missing you. And already drunk.’

Another foul-mouthed message sent by the woman two days later unleashed a tirade of abuse against an unidentified person, who she described as a ‘Complete f****** w***** of a t*** pot c*** of a b******.’

She sent an email to the man on May 4 last year saying : “I’m so tempted to call you and have a conversation about w******, stockings and breasts.'

'Extreme': The woman, who can't be named for legal reasons, sent the notes on the night she feared her lover's wife might confront her

In other messages sent the same evening she talked of how ‘I want to be a bloke clearly!’ to which her lover replied ‘It is great having a penis.’

This prompted the woman to fire off another pair of raunchy emails. In one she said: 'Must be great to w*** easily, wee standing up when out in a wood, and have something to play with when bored.'

Ten minutes later she sent another email to the man saying: 'I am serious. I’ve decided that as I can make my own decisions, buy furniture and put it together [as long as it doesn’t have doors] and financially support myself, I have no need for a man at all - except physically.

'So if I get a Rabbit [sex toy], plus the skills to use it, I won’t need one at all. But seriously, a penis is so easy for self-pleasuring - you are lucky. I’d do it all the time if I was you.'

The pair returned to the sex chat a fortnight later and indulged in a conversation about playing an x-rated ‘treasure hunt.’

It began after the woman sent an email on June 17 last year saying: 'I am now up and heading out. Been looking at my breasts for a while. Not sure about them with the tan line. (I bet you have no idea what to say to that).'

The man replied: 'I’m sure the tan line on your breasts will be fine. I assume you used my advice and wore the blue plasters over your nipples and that is your tan line. That would be great, it would be like a treasure hunt.'

Soon after she sent an excited email saying: 'That’s so funny - X marks the spot! May need to put criss-cross blue plasters in another location if that works. “Certain” men need all the help they can get.

'Fancy playing pirates then?!'

During closing submissions at Central London Employment Tribunal the woman said: 'No policy states that email use is gross misconduct. The policies on email are confusing in any event.'

She also said she had been discriminated against for being a woman as her lover had not faced the same disciplinary procedure because he worked for a separate company.

UCLH deny the claims. Judgement on the case has been reserved until a later date.
