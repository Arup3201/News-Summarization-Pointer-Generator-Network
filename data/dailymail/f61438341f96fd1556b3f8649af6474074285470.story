David Silva and Ki Sung-yueng have topped EA Sports' Performance Index after impressing in the Premier League at the weekend.

Silva fired a brace against Newcastle in Manchester City's 5-0 win against John Carver's side, while Ki Sung-yueng scored in Swansea's home win against Manchester United.

Here, EA Sports crunch the numbers to reveal the 10 best Premier League performers from the weekend. Silva was No 1, but who else makes up the top 10?

10. Victor Moses, Stoke City (PPI score: 36.8)

Stoke City fought back from a goal down to pick up all three points against Aston Villa and Victor Moses played a major role in his side's winning goal.

Moses, who is on loan from Chelsea, converted Stoke's 91st-minute penalty kick after he was fouled by Ron Vlaar.

The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League.

It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices?

1. Winning performance

2. Player's performance per match

3. Appearances

4. Goals scored

5. Assists

6. Clean sheets

9. Danny Welbeck, Arsenal (PPI score: 37.2)

Danny Welbeck impressed in Arsenal's win at Selhurst Park on Saturday as he claimed an assist for both of his side's goals.

The Arsenal striker was adjudged to have been fouled by Palace left back Pape Souare in the eighth minute, which allowed Santi Cazorla to score from the spot, and he forced Julian Speroni into parrying a shot before Olivier Giroud poked home the rebound.

8. Raheem Sterling, Liverpool (PPI score: 37.4)

Raheem Sterling has been in fine form for the Reds since returning from a mid-season break in the Caribbean.

The England international struck in the 73rd minute to ensure his side claimed a crucial victory at St Mary's.

7. Bafetimbi Gomis, Swansea City (PPI score: 39.6)

It may have been one of the luckiest goals of his career, but Bafetimbi Gomis has been credited with scoring the winner against Manchester United.

Gomis deflected a shot from Jonjo Shelvey past David de Gea to pile misery on Louis van Gaal's side.

6. Edin Dzeko, Manchester City (PPI score: 39.7)

Edin Dzeko sent a healthy reminder to Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini by scoring his first Premier League goal since September 27. 

The Bosnia international also claimed two assists to impress his manager ahead of their Champions League showdown against Barcelona.

5. Samir Nasri, Manchester City (PPI score: 40.5)

Like Dzeko, Samir Nasri would have been eager to impress against Newcastle in order to seal a spot in Pellegrini's starting line-up against La Liga giants Barcelona.

Nasri scored one and set up another to cap off a positive evening for the Frenchman.

4. Olivier Giroud, Arsenal (PPI score: 41.3)

Arsenal leapfrogged Manchester United during the course of the weekend thanks to Olivier Giroud's eighth Premier League goal of the season.

Giroud scored from close-range to score what turned out to be the eventual winner but also made three important clearances to help his defensive team-mates.

3. Santi Cazorla, Arsenal (PPI score: 41.8)

The Spanish playmaker kept his cool to score a penalty in the opening stages of Arsenal's match at Selhurst Park.

Arsene Wenger will need the likes of Santi Cazorla to be at his best for the remaining 12 Premier League games in order to secure a spot in next season's Champions League.

2. Ki Sung-yueng, Swansea City (PPI score: 42.4)

Ki Sung-yueng scored in Swansea's win against Manchester United during the opening weekend of the Premier League and struck against on Saturday to cancel out Ander Herrera's opener.

Garry Monk will be glad to have the South Korean back in his ranks after his exploits at the Asian Cup in January.

1. David Silva, Manchester City (PPI score: 57.1)

He only played 59 minutes against Newcastle but that was enough to take the top gong for this weekend's round of Premier League fixtures.

David Silva scored a brace, claimed an assist and successfully completed 90 per cent of his attempted passes during his side's 5-0 rout at the Etihad Stadium.
