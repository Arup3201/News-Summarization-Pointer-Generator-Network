The only thing better than spotting a gorgeous guy on your long journey home is one engrossed in a novel.

But if there are no crush-worthy cuties on your line, now there's a place where you can swoon over all the gorgeous bookworms seen riding the subway: @hotdudesreading on Instagram. 

The account for 'good looks and good books' is less than two weeks old, but has already amassed a following of more than 100,000 - thanks to New York's commuters taking creeper shots. 

Hot Dudes Reading introduces us to the best the New York Transit Authority has to offer -  from clean-cut Patrick Bateman types to the sculptor whose side job is modeling for Banana Republic.

Whether their noses are in a newspaper, notebook or novel on the F Train, handsome gents are pictured alongside a witty description and humorous hashtag with book puns galore.

And with Valentine's Day fast approaching, it's good to know there are attractive and literate men in the wild.
