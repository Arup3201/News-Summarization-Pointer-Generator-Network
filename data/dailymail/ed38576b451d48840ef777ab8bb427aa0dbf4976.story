Twenty dogs who were being looked after by the son of Arizona Senator Jeff Flake at a kennel have died following an air conditioning malfunction.

Sheriff's deputies found the animals' bodies piled up in a shed at Green Acres Dog Boarding Facility in Gilbert on Friday after they sweltered to death over night.

Authorities said one of the dogs had chewed through an electrical wire and cut off the air conditioning to the room, leaving them to overheat in temperatures reaching 100 degrees.

They were in the care of Austin Flake, the son of Senator Flake, and his wife Logan while the kennel's owners, Logan's parents Maleisa and Todd Hughes, were on holiday in Florida.

Tragedy: Twenty dogs died at Green Acres Dog Boarding Facility (pictured) in Gilbert, Arizona after one of them chewed threw a wire and broke the air conditioning unit. The minders found their bodies on Friday

Austin Flake and his wife last checked on the dogs in the west area of the property at 11pm and then went to sleep in the east part of the house that is served by a different air conditioning unit.

When they checked on the dogs at 5.30am on Friday, they found them sweltering in temperatures reaching 100 degrees and the chewed wire sparking, Maleisa Hughes told CNN.

They pulled the animals' bodies outside and tried to save them by hosing them with cold water, but they could not be revived and the couple did not call 911 before the dogs died, CNN reported.

Some of the owners' conduct since the death was suspicious, the pet owners and officials said.

The families of the dogs told KPNX that they were not told about the incident until the day after the deaths - and that the owner initially said the animals had run away. 

'I thought, "Well, I should just go over there",' one owner, Kathy Harrington, said. 'I pulled up to two dead dogs in the driveway.'

Emotional: Maleisa Hughes, who owns the kennel with her husband, was on holiday in Florida at the time of the incident. She sobbed as she said the chewed wires could have sparked a fire and killed her family

Valerie Collins, who left two dogs at the facility, said that she also went to the kennel to demand answers.

'We went out of the front and he carried my Daisy, who was lifeless,' she told Fox. 'I prayed that they were still alive and he just threw her at my feet like a piece of meat.' 

Jacqueline Heath, who lost three dogs, said her home would never be the same. 

'It still doesn't seem real that I'm never going to see these dogs again,' she told CBS as she broke down in tears. 'We don't have them running around. We're never going to have them to cuddle.'

Owner Todd Hughes has since admitted that he lied to the animals' owners about the dogs running away.  

'I wasn't thinking straight, but I should have thought better than that,' Hughes said, USA Today reported. 'Nobody trained me on how to handle this. I made a bad decision. It was terrible.'

Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio called the incident a 'tragic accident' that had left officers 'heartbroken and devastated' - but he still cast doubt on the owners' account.

Suspicions: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio said investigations into the deaths were continuing

'It seems unreasonable that dogs could be healthy at 11.00pm at night and dead by 5.30am the next morning as the owners suggest,' he said.

No charges have yet been filed but his office continues to investigate. 

'We are going to check phone records. We are going to check air condition meters,' Arpaio said. 'We will see if there is any violation of the animal cruelty laws, any criminal intent, neglect.'

Maleisa Hughes, a mother of nine, became emotional as she spoke with reporters.

'Nobody feels worse about these poor special angel dogs than me and my husband, my daughter and my son-in-law,' she said. 'Nobody, nobody.'

Speaking out: Senator Jeff Flake, pictured beside his son Austin, wife Cheryl and daughter Alexis at an election night rally in 2008, said his 'heart went out to owners who lost their pets' in the incident

'The wire was sparking,' she continued. 'It could have burned down our whole house. My whole house could have burned down and all my children could have died, and then it would have been a tragedy. But because it didn't catch fire, we're dog killers.'

One of the dogs that died belonged to the owners. 

She refused to comment on her connection with Senator Flake, simply saying that Austin Flake was her son-in-law and that she didn't feel it was appropriate to comment about her state senator.

Following the public outcry over the incident, Senator Flake issued a public apology. 

'I can't imagine the devastating loss these families are experiencing. My heart goes out to the owners who lost their beloved pets,' he said.
