Australia captain Michael Clarke bids farewell to one-day international cricket on Sunday — to save himself for one more shot at humiliating England.

The 33-year-old has decided to retire from the 50-over game after steering his country to the World Cup final, with the sole intention of leading the Aussies into this summer’s Ashes showdown in England.

‘A priority for me is to continue to be successful in the Test format,’ said Clarke. ‘I think by walking away from one-day cricket it probably gives me my best opportunity.’

And that spells danger for England with Clarke hungrier than ever to finally win an away Ashes series, having lost on all three of his previous trips.

Clarke scored two centuries guiding Australia to their 5-0 whitewash of Alastair Cook’s dismal team last winter, but he’s desperate to break his duck in England in what will almost certainly be his last Ashes away tour.

‘I’ve never hid behind the fact that I find Test cricket to be the pinnacle of our sport,’ said Clarke, who has won 108 Test caps including 30 against England.

The 33-year-old made the surprise announcement at a press conference on Saturday morning 

‘I’ve never gone down that road anyway in regard to what is the best thing to do for the public interest, as I’m sure you would have seen through my career, I’ve copped my fair share of smacks in the mouth.

‘But I am whoI am and it’s about being true to myself and I don’t feel bad about saying I believe Test cricket is the toughest part of our game. I love that challenge, I find it extremely difficult every Test match I play. I do see it as the pinnacle. I still think I’ve got a lot to offer the team as captain of the Australian Test team, and I want to make sure I continue to have success in that format.’

Clarke was made captain in all formats when Ricky Ponting stood down following the 2011 World Cup. He will be making his 245th one-day appearance for Australia and his 75th as skipper on Sunday as Australia take on New Zealand, led by Brendon McCullum (inset).

George Bailey and Steve Smith are thought to be the two men most likely to succeed Clarke in captaining the Aussies.

Clarke made his ODI debut 12 years ago and has scored almost 8,000 runs for his country

Clarke has been suffering with a back problem for some time and a hamstring injury ruled him out of Australia’s World Cup build up with George Bailey and Steve Smith, the two men most likely to succeed him, both leading the side.

‘I don’t think it is realistic that I’ll be fit and healthy and available to play the next World Cup so I believe it is the right time,’ he said. ‘I think I’ll leave the one-day game for the Australian team in a better place than when I took over the captaincy.’
