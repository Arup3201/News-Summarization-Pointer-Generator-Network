Fears that the Syrian civil war is spreading into Lebanon grew yesterday after a rocket attack on Beirut.

Two southern neighbourhoods of the Lebanese capital which are strongholds of Hezbollah were targeted. At least four people were injured.

It came just hours after Hezbollah – a militant Iranian-backed Shia Muslim group – reaffirmed its support for Syrian dictator President Assad.

The group’s leader, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, vowed to help Assad win the civil war and warned that his overthrow would give rise to extremists.

Assad’s opponents are overwhelmingly Sunni Muslims and Lebanon’s sectarian divide mirrors that of Syria, with Lebanese factions taking sides in their neighbour’s civil war.

One rebel leader has threatened to strike Hezbollah strongholds in retaliation for the group sending men to fight alongside Assad’s forces.

The rocket attack came two days after Russia's foreign ministry said the Syrian government has agreed to a conference on the country's future proposed by Russia and the United States.

The Syrian government had 'agreed in principle' to participate in the conference in Geneva which is expected within two weeks, Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said in televised remarks.

Mr Lukashevich, however, said that it was impossible to set the date for the conference at this point because there is 'no clarity about who will speak on behalf of the opposition and what powers they will have'.

Opposition groups have spoken against President Bashar Assad's representatives taking part.

More than 70,000 people have been killed and several million displaced since the uprising against Mr Assad erupted in March 2011 and escalated into a civil war.

It was the first confirmation that Mr Assad's government would be willing to take part in the talks with the opposition.

But despite the announcement from Moscow, one of Mr Assad's staunchest allies, Damascus has not offered any definitive statement on the proposed talks.

The US-Russian plan, similar to the one set out last year in Geneva, calls for talks on a transitional government and an open-ended ceasefire.
