Former girlfriends of Oscar Pistorius and their families and friends took to social media yesterday to give furiously opposing verdicts of the athlete’s character.

Trish Taylor, mother of Pistorius’ ex-girlfriend Samantha Taylor, wrote with some relief on Facebook: ‘I’m so glad Sammy is safe and out of the clutches of that man.’

Her daughter, a 26-year-old student from Cape Town, had recently tried to cast a spotlight on the Blade Runner’s previously unseen dark side.

After dating Pistorius for a year and a half until last year, Miss Taylor had told South Africa’s City Press newspaper that ‘Oscar is certainly not what people think he is’.

And when asked about his new relationship with Reeva Steenkamp, she lashed out: ‘Oscar has such a way with women. She’s probably not the only one he’s got.’

But another ex-girlfriend, Jenna Edkins, yesterday defended the sporting star.

She took to Twitter to stress: ‘All I am saying is let him speak, let his side be heard without jumping to conclusions.’

She offered ‘love and support’ to the Pistorius family and tweeted: ‘I have dated Oscar on and off for 5 YEARS, NOT ONCE has he EVER lifted a finger to me or made me fear for my life.’ 

Bachelor Pistorius had also been linked to a succession of blondes, including several models - among them Russian supermodel Anastassia Khozissova and South Africans Melissa Rom and Chanelle du Plessis.

He was first seen with Miss Steenkamp at an awards ceremony in November.

One of her former boyfriends, Alan Taylor, could not conceal his grief yesterday.

The 31-year-old DJ and bar manager told MailOnline: ‘I sincerely, with all my heart, hope justice is served.'

He added: ‘It makes me sad that someone took away someone so special, so young.‘

It emerged that Miss Steenkamp had been due on the day she died to give a speech to schoolchildren revealing she had previously been involved in an abusive relationship.

She was to have told secondary school students the resultant ‘loss of self worth’ had prompted her to move home cities to rebuild her life.

In a draft of her speech, Miss Steenkamp was preparing to caution students about what happened after she broke her back and lost mobility: ‘I was in an abusive relationship at the same time (his mother used to abuse him) and all together these factors encouraged my move to Jozi [Johannesburg].’

Her message would have ended: ‘I hope you have the most amazing Valentines Day and that you are spoilt with love and roses and chocolates. Go home and tell your parents, siblings, neighbours that they are appreciated. You will go to bed with a happy heart and open mind for the future.’
