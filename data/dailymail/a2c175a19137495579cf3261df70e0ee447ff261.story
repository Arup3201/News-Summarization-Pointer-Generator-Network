Well, this is a far cry from the tawdry scenes we're used to seeing in porn films.  

In fact, without closer inspection you’d be forgiven for thinking that this incredible new video was just a nature documentary. In fact it's pornography filmed with a flying drone.

As the camera pans out over rolling mountains and secluded seascapes you could blink and miss the couples who feature in the film, engaging in sexual acts in the most picturesque and remote of landscapes.

Pornography filmed with a flying drone is being billed as female friendly porn

But having sex they are. Filmed in San Francisco and with locations spanning from a luscious green corn field to some deserted steps this is a style of pornography the likes of which we have never seen before.

Fans claim that it is much more subtle in its nature and therefore far more female friendly.

Brandon LaGanke, a filmmaker from Brooklyn and one of the people behind the video told Vice of his creation, ‘We wanted to explore the whole idea of drone privacy and strikes—this idea of 'make porn, not war.

'It started as a kind of funny commentary on privacy and voyeurism, but it quickly became a conceptual grounding.’ 

In two scenes from the film a lesbian couple enjoy themselves on top of a roof (left), whilst an amorous pair make a pit stop at the side of the road for some fun

Whilst the film is pornography it also captures a series of beautiful nature shoots, for example the forest covered mountains in San Fran

An example of the type of drone camera that Ghost+Cow would have used to film their 'Drone Boning' video. You can clearly see the camera attached to the front of the device

Brandon LaGanke and John Carlucci aka Ghost+Cow are the men behind 'Drone Boning'

The film captures a variety of straight, gay and lesbian couples having sex. 

Brandon’s film-making partner John Carlucci said, ‘We wanted to see the artistic value of this perspective.

'It's an omniscient point of view, really. 

'We did these shots in places where you couldn't see much from the ground, but then you put a drone in the air and you can see what's happening.’

The result is quite stunning, although the filmmakers ran into trouble when they were spotted by a woman who was walking her dog on the beach where they were filming. 

Brandon and John own a film company named Ghost+Cow and this is the first time either of the men have embarked on a project like this. 

Drones are essentially flying cameras. They are operated from the ground via remote control and are fitted with high quality lens to capture the views below.

Buying a drone can set you back anything from £300 to £1500 and they are especially popular with those wishing to make nature films.

Recently popular American band OK Go filmed their I Won't Let You down video using a drone, according to reports the band wanted to make something that was unconventional.

In the film below a best man has persuaded the bride and groom at a wedding to have their wedding rings delivered by drone. It's a risky business!

After meeting whilst working at a global advertising agency in New York the pair have worked largely on music projects including videos for several underground acts including Zebra Katz.  

Filming with a drone has become increasingly popular over the last few years, although not always for making porn films.

The BBC even has its own in house drone team who work specifically on documentaries filmed with the flying cameras.

Ethical porn

Dreams of Spanking is a website run by Pandora Blake. Pandora believes that it is important that porn be truly consensual and as such the viewer can watch it knowing that all parties involved were happy to be taking part.

Arty porn 

Inside Flesh are a group of German film-makers who make incredibly arty porn which is meant to focus on “human carnality in all its aspects”. Nicola Formichetti put some of their work in his visuals for his Diesel FW14 show.

HD porn 

It’s not just your favourite films you can see in HD now you can watch porn in incredible detail as well. Sites such as Digital Playground have full length HD porn films, whilst a lot of mainstream porn sites now also have a special HD section.
