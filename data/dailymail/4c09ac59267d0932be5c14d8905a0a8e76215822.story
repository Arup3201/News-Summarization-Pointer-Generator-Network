Those waiting eagerly for the birth of royal babies on other side of the Channel won't have too much longer to wait after Monaco's Prince Albert revealed that his heirs will be born before Christmas.

Speaking to local newspaper Monaco-Matin, the Prince spoke of his excitement about the birth of his heirs, which he expects to happen within the next few weeks.

The royal, 56, also said that, unlike many modern fathers, he has chosen not to find out the gender of the twins before they are born.

Royal greetings: Princess Charlene of Monaco and Prince Albert II of Monaco greeted the crowd from the palace's balcony during the National Day Parade as part of Monaco National Day Celebrations yesterday

Pucker up! Princess Charlene of Monaco and Prince Albert II share a kiss on palace's balcony at Monaco National Day just days after Albert reveals the twins should arrive before Christmas 

 'As it is a twin pregnancy the birth will surely take place a dozen days early,' he told the French language paper.

Princess Charlene, 36, who has chosen to find out the babies genders, is under strict instructions not to tell him.

'The princess probably knows but she is playing the game,' said the expectant father. 'She is keeping the secret as I asked her to.'

'You know, one doesn't often have the opportunity to have such pleasant surprises in life. That is why I prefer not to know the babies' gender before the birth.'

The pregnant princess (pictured in September, left, and during a trip to America last month, right) has said: 'The prospect of the upcoming birth is so magical, so powerful'

Princess Charlene showed off her baby bump alongside Prince Albert at the Princess Grace Foundation Cocktail Reception in Los Angeles last month 

Prince Albert has two children from previous relationships - daughter Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, 22, and son Alexandre Coste, 10 - but neither are able to inherit the throne as both were born out of wedlock.

For her part, Princess Charlene is said to be looking forward to becoming a mother for the first time and described her pregnancy as 'magical'.

And it is not just the couple themselves who are eagerly awaiting the birth. Earlier this week, Charlene's parents - who have set up a temporary residence in Monaco in preparation for twins' arrival - spoke of their excitement.

Mike Wittstock described the feeling as 'amazing'. Speaking to French publication Point de vue, he also said that despite their royal status he intends to treat the twins as normally as possible.

'I will respect everything required by the protocol, my daughter knows that, but other than that they will be treated in the same way as their cousins.'
