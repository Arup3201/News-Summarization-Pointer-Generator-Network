'Real hatred': French police say Mr Al-Hilli kept detailed recordings of all his telephone conversations leading up to his murder while in a bitter inheritance dispute with his brother

Detectives trying to unlock the Alps murders case believe a deal involving a 'transfer of technologies' could be a key line of inquiry, it has emerged.

Investigators remain baffled as to why three members of a British-Iraqi family were shot dead close to Lake Annecy, in eastern France, a year ago.

But at a joint Anglo-French press briefing they said 'industrial espionage could also indicate the involvement of secret services'.

The officer leading the investigation also said that Saad Al-Hilli, a 50-year-old engineer from Surrey who was among the victims, kept ‘meticulous recordings’ of all of his conversations up until the massacre.

Annecy prosecutor Eric Maillaud, who is leading the inquiry, said a bitter inheritance dispute between Saad and his brother Zaid Al-Hilli, 54, was an important line in the investigation.

Mr Maillaud said: ‘The victim recorded all his telephone conversations. We therefore have some very precise details.’

The prosecutor said Saad 'had in his possession a lot more material than his job would justify', The Mirror has reported.

Mr Maillaud said: 'The theory that this relates to foreign countries and industrial espionage could also indicate the involvement of secret services.

'This is one aspect of an extremely complex investigation, one which is going to demand a lot more time.'

Al-Hilli's brother Zaid was arrested in June under suspicion of conspiracy to murder, and is currently on police bail. He vehemently denies any wrongdoing.

Mr Maillaud said that there was a ‘real hatred’ between the two brothers, and that Saad carried all the documents relating to their dispute on holiday with him to France last year.

On September 5th 2012, he was killed in the attack by a gunman, along with his wife Ikbal, 47, and her mother Suhaila al-Allaf, 74.

French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, was also killed in shootings which orphaned Saad’s daughters, Zainab, eight, and Zeena, five.

A total of 21 bullets were used in 
the killing, with none damaging the bodywork of the family BMW in which 
the Al-Hillis were sitting.

Instead, bullets passed straight through a car window before finding their human targets.

At
least five others ended up in the body of the cyclist, Mr Mollier, with
the gunman reloading at least twice, ballistics reports suggest.

‘There was a certain form of obsession’ about the inheritance dispute, said Mr Maillaud, explaining that it concerned money and property left by the brothers’ father, Kadhim, who died in Spain two years ago aged 85.

Mr
Maillaud said that the recorded phone conversations, together with 
computer records, were being studied at length, and could provide vital 
clues before Zaid is re-interviewed by police in October.

But British police confirmed that Zaid was in the UK last September, and was not considered ‘the prime suspect’.

Detective superintendent Nick May said: ‘The tragic events of a year ago left four people dead in appalling circumstances.

‘We remain committed to finding answers to what happened that day on behalf of their families, particularly for the two young girls who lost their parents.

‘This remains a complex inquiry and we continue to have a team of officers dedicated to supporting the investigation.

‘We have established a good working relationship with our French colleagues and are continuing to pursue a number of lines of inquiry in the UK.’

One
theory put forward by an 'English witness' says an assassin with 
military experience may have murdered a British family and a French cyclist in the Alps for just £420 each.

The chilling claim was made yesterday on the first anniversary of the massacre.

The
source confirmed that a witness had suggested the entire 
Al-Hilli family was targeted by a 'mercenary' from the Balkans who was 
paid the equivalent of just £1680. 

British police officers involved in the 
Anglo-French investigation have so far refused to comment on the 
enquiry, but their counterparts in Annecy confirmed that suspicions 
about a contract killing are 'high on the agenda'.

French
detectives are also following up claims that a French convict was 
offered '100,000 euros (£84,000 ) 'to eliminate an Iraqi settled in 
England', according to claims published in the Le Figaro newspaper 
yesterday.

This suggests that someone may have explored a number of options before finally ordering a hit.

Saad's
brother was arrested at his home in Surrey in June 
on suspicion of conspiracy to murder, but has since been bailed.

Zaid,
who has proved he was in the UK this time last year, denies any 
wrongdoing and there is no concrete proof for any of the claims about 
the killings being commissioned.

But
the French now routinely leak information allegedly linking Zaid to the
murders, while attempting to close down other lines of enquiry.

Annecy
prosecutor Eric Maillaud said the brothers were in dispute over their 
father's inheritance, which included the £1 million family home in 
Claygate, Surrey.

'Saad was scared of his brother,' said Mr Maillaud. 'It's for this reason that he changed the locks of the house.'

Probe: Sources close to the investigation have suggested that the killings could be linked to an inheritance dispute within the Al-Hilli family. But no evidence has been produced to support the suspicions. This is Saad Al Hilli's home

Today
there were also claims from the French sources that the brothers had a 
'visceral hatred' for one another and that Saad's 'paranoid fear' was so
great that he kept an illegal Taser stun gun for personal protection.

Saad had also started using satellite technology through his smart phone which enabled friends to track his every move.

The brothers' father, Kadhim, died in 
Spain two years ago aged 85, leaving several properties and the 
equivalent of more than £600,000 in a Geneva account.

The French now claim Zaid had attempted to 'siphon' money from the account, and to fabricate his father's will in his favour.

However, Mr Maillaud admitted that 
there was currently not enough evidence to charge Zaid, and that other 
theories could not be discounted.

The murder scene - an 
isolated mountain layby - reopened a few days after the killings, and 
today floral tributes were already beginning to appear where the family 
BMW had been parked.

Saad's seven-year-old daughter, Zainab, was beaten over the head with the butt of the suspected murder weapon - a Luger P06 in 7.65mm Parabellum.

Her four-year old sister, Zeena was left deeply traumatised after hiding beneath the skirts of her dead mother in the back of the BMW for eight hours before being discovered by gendarmes.

Both girls are now in the care of extended family, following a court battle with Surrey social services who wanted to keep them with foster parents.

French police still believe they may still unlock the secrets of what happened through finally remembering what they saw.

The horrific killings of the Al-Hilli family in one of the most scenic areas in the French Alps has baffled detectives.

Since the murders a year ago, a number of theories have emerged as to why the family were slaughtered.

French investigating sources believe an inheritance dispute within the Al-Hilli family could be a motive.

There have also been revelations of a possible connection to the former regime of Saddam Hussein.

It
followed claims that the deposed tyrant may have deposited £840,000 
into a Swiss bank account in the name of victim Said al-Hilli's father.

At one stage, detectives believed they had been shot by a serial killer with a hatred of tourists.

Police said they had linked the murders of the British family with the mysterious death of another tourist last July.

Other
theories have speculated that the French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, a 
45-year-old nuclear industry worker, was the primary target.

There have also been claims that a mystery motorcyclist seen around the Alpine beauty spot could have carried out the killings.
