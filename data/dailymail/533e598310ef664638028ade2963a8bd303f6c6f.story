Gary Cahill knows it will take some time to win back the supporters who have shunned England in the wake of their disappointing World Cup campaign.

England fans made their unhappiness clear on Wednesday night when vast numbers of them stayed away from Wembley for the friendly win over Norway.

Just 40,181 turned up to watch the Three Lions edge past the Scandinavians 1-0 in the first game since Roy Hodgson's winless World Cup campaign.

Cahill thinks it is way too easy to write off the England team, but he acknowledges there will be no dramatic transformation.

Beating Switzerland in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier would be a good start, though.

'If we win it would go towards (getting the fans back on side), but I think it's not going to happen overnight,' the England and Chelsea defender said.

'Everyone should know and not expect that.

'Everyone needs to be patient with the young players that have come in and don't have the experience of players like Wayne Rooney.'

With 15 senior players missing through injury, Hodgson has had to call upon previously uncapped players like Calum Chambers and Fabian Delph for the two matches.

Danny Rose is another uncapped player in the squad while John Stones looks set to make his first competitive start on Monday in Basle.

Cahill, who had to wait until he was 25 before he achieved such a landmark, thinks the new crop of players will need time to bed in, especially with the likes of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard having retired after the World Cup.

'It's a very young squad,' said Cahill, who will start in Switzerland despite slight concerns over an ankle injury.

'Stevie and Frank have retired so you're forced to pick the young players.

'For young ones to come in after the disappointment of the summer and to play now and get your debut now is tough.

'It's hard to come into an England team, never mind when there's so-called doom and gloom out there.'

Cahill, who started all three matches, admits he will be forever scarred by England's winless campaign in South America.

'It's not something you are just going to forget,' the centre-back said.

'But it's not something you need to harp on about.

'It's something you need to move forward, to help you try and get back on track.'
