A wealthy couple locked in a bitter legal row over the wife’s £26million divorce settlement are no better than spoilt, squabbling children, an exasperated judge claimed yesterday.

Lord Justice Thorpe said Jennifer Evans’s dispute with her estranged husband Mark was ‘puerile’, warning them: ‘Somebody has to come into the nursery to make some rules.’

He also expressed amazement at the ‘completely disproportionate’ legal bills already run up in the case, adding: ‘I simply cannot understand how the parties can litigate with such profligate extravagance.’

Mr Evans, 47, and his wife were ‘penniless’ when they met and married in 1985. But they became multi-millionaires after setting up a financial IT firm.

The couple, who have two teenage daughters, separated in July 2010, with Mrs Evans starting divorce proceedings last April.

Mr Evans’s shares in their computer firm, Confluence Corporation, are believed to be worth at least £40million.

Their non-business assets are valued at about £12million.

This year, Mrs Evans, 46, who lives in a £10.6million apartment near 
Harrods in Knightsbridge, West London, was awarded assets worth 
£26million by a family judge. However, fearing that after their divorce 
her husband might legally transfer his company shares to another person 
thereby denying her the full payout, she successfully applied for a 
second family court hearing to agree a settlement.

Meanwhile, she went to the Court of Appeal to block a decree absolute 
finalising her divorce, arguing that she needed a ‘cast-iron guarantee’ 
that her husband’s shares could not be sold or transferred.

Her counsel, Charles Howard QC, told Lords Justice Thorpe and Rimer 
yesterday at the High Court that otherwise there would be ‘a very 
considerable risk’ that ‘the great bulk’ of the capital built up during 
the marriage could be denied to her.

He said Mrs Evans is concerned that, if the divorce is finalised before a
family judge makes the second ruling on how the couple’s assets should 
be divided, she could be left ‘sitting on an empty judgment’.

Explaining
the fear at the heart of Mrs Evans’s fight to stay married for the time
being, Mr Howard said: ‘We are worried the wife is not going to get her
share of Confluence.

‘Once there is a decree absolute, the husband could transfer all of the 
shares to a new wife, without board approval, and unravelling that would
be very, very difficult.’

However, Martin Pointer QC, representing Mr Evans, said there was no 
need to postpone the decree absolute, adding: ‘My client is prohibited 
from dealing in these shares by an injunction.’

Describing the married life of the ‘very rich’ couple, Mr Howard said: 
‘The parties lived an opulent lifestyle during the latter years of the 
marriage, having homes in the UK, the US, and the Turks and Caicos 
islands. They enjoyed the use of private jets and first-class travel and
retaining personal assistants and household staff.’

Lord Justice Thorpe criticised the couple for their handling of the 
divorce, adding: ‘It seems to me almost puerile, these very rich people 
distrusting and disliking each other intensely. So somebody has to come 
into the nursery to make some rules to dissipate all this nonsense.’

He gave Mrs Evans leave to argue at a full Appeal Court hearing that the
decree absolute should be postponed pending a final ruling on the 
financial aspects of the divorce.

He said the decree absolute was ‘long overdue’ but added that even the 
smallest risk that Mrs Evans could be deprived of her share of the 
marital assets should be eliminated.

He concluded: ‘With great 
reluctance, I am persuaded that we have to give permission to appeal.’

No date has been set for the full hearing of Mrs Evans’s appeal.
