Facing extradition: A judge has ruled Dorothee Burkhart, the mother of a serial arson suspect, can be extradited from the US to her native Germany to face numerous fraud charges including the claim she failed to pay for breast augmentation

A judge has ruled the mother of a suspected serial arsonist can be extradited from the United States to face numerous fraud charges  including the claim she failed to pay for breast augmentation.

Dorothee Burkhart, 53, is also accused in her native Germany of failing to return security deposits on rental properties she leased and accepting fees and deposits on apartments she did not own.

Her 24-year-old son, Harry Burkhart, has been charged with 100 arson-related counts involving 49 fires in Hollywood, West Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley.

Ms Burkhart appears to own an erotic massage business and has been linked to websites offering the services of 'Goddess Annabelle' in the Hollywood area.

The sites describe their owner as a 'sexologist', but emphasise that her massages are not to be confused with prostitution.

She was taken into custody on an arrest warrant issued by German authorities in late December - right before dozens of fires, mostly started in parked cars, left Los Angeles residents on edge and caused an estimated $3 million in damage.

The fires raged from December 30 to January 2.

Harry Burkhart pleaded innocent in January to arson and related charges and is being held on $7.5 million bail.

An arson investigator said in court papers that the younger Burkhart was motivated by 'rage against Americans' and wanted to terrorise as many residents of Los Angeles as possible.   

Harry Burkhart was arrested after a tip-off from a member of the US State Department's Diplomatic Security field office who recognized him on surveillance videotape from his mother's initial court hearing in December.   

According to court papers, Harry Burkhart was ejected from the courtroom after shouting a profanity against Americans.

In ordering Dorothee Burkhart's extradition, the magistrate judge rejected an argument by her attorneys that she was a key material witness in her son's case, and that she could be tortured or killed in Germany.

Judge Charles F. Eick wrote in the document: 'Ms Burkhart's allegations that she would be inhumanely treated, tortured or killed if extradited to Germany are simply not credible.'

State prosecutors in Germany said Harry Burkhart was also wanted in that country on suspicion of starting a fire that burned down his family's home in Neukirchen.

Judge Eick denied an application by Harry Burkhart to intervene in his mother's extradition as well as her motion to stay the proceeding.

Ms Burkhart argued that she needed to help her son's defense.

US attorney's spokesman Thom Mrozek said that though Eick's ruling is final, Dorothee Burkhart can choose to file a habeus corpus petition, which would be tantamount to an appeal.

If the decision is not appealed, it will be forwarded to the Secretary of State, who will have 60 days to review the matter and decide whether she will be extradited to Germany.
