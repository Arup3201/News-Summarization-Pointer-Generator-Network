Australian customs officials are on high alert as the deadly Ebola virus spreads across the world.

The federal government's top health experts have met with border protection agencies who will step up monitoring and screening of incoming passengers at Australian airports  as fear mounts about the world's largest outbreak of Ebola.

Dr Glenn Marsh, a CSIRO research scientist currently working on a vaccine for the deadly virus, said it was 'always possible' Ebola could reach Australian shores.

'Airline staff and customs are all on the lookout for any passengers with signs and symptoms of ebolavirus infection,' Dr Marsh told Daily Mail Australia.

Dr Marsh, who is working with live Ebola samples at a high containment laboratory in Geelong near Melbourne, said the huge outbreak in West Africa was 'terrifying' and 'seems to be fairly out of control'.

'Fortunately we have a very good health care system here in Australia so it is highly unlikely that disease would spread here,' he said.

'We are very well equipped to contain the virus and stop it spreading in Australia.

'The key to managing an outbreak is rapid diagnosis and then to ensure that the infected patients are managed appropriately including ensuring all health care workers are wearing gowns, gloves and masks.'

The death of an American citizen from Ebola last week has sparked alarm across the globe after he was able to board an international flight while carrying the incurable disease – potentially infecting other passengers who could fly across the world.

Ebola spreads via bodily fluids so secretions from infected people generally contain the virus, according to Dr Marsh.

Border protection officers are on alert to check people who are unwell as they land in Australia to detect Ebola symptoms. '

'Australia has one of the best border protection systems in the world checking people who are unwell in flight and at the airport,' Australia's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Baggoley said.

'Since the Ebola outbreak the Department of Health has been in contact with all border protection agencies to alert them to look out for the possibility of Ebola when identifying a person landing in Australia who is unwell.

The Department of Foreign Affairs has urged Australians not to travel to the West African nations affected by the virus. They said there is little the federal government can do if they run into trouble.

Australian embassy staff have deferred travel plans to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

'We recommend Australian travellers do the same,' the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade says in its latest updated advice.

There's a real risk that Australians travelling in the region could become stranded if the outbreak worsens. DFAT warns that borders in the region could close and travel restrictions be imposed with 'little or no warning'.

Australians who ignore the government's advice are being urged to check their travel insurance as medical evacuations for any Ebola patient would be 'extremely difficult to conduct'.

'The Australian government may have limited options in providing consular assistance in these circumstances,' DFAT says.

Those in the region should closely monitor local health advice and know the symptoms of the virus. Symptoms are are severe and include high fever and weakness followed by external and internal bleeding.

Any traveller to the region showing these signs before or after visiting should seek medical attention. Victims of the virus, or those suffering symptoms, should be avoided at all costs as the disease is highly contagious.

Dr Marsh will start working with ferrets to research potential Ebola vaccines because they have displayed human-like infections with other high-risk pathogens

Health workers in West Africa wear protective gear on the way to bury a woman who died of the Ebola virus from the isolation unit in Foya, Lofa County, Liberia'These systems have been rigorously tested with both the SARS outbreak and the more recent Swine Flu pandemic of 2009.'

While the Department of Health says the likelihood of Ebola coming to Australia is low, health authorities from around the country are discussing the possibility and subsequent ways to respond.

If there was a suspected case picked up by border protection, there are laboratories with the highest level of physical containment in Australia.

'(This) provides laboratory space, testing facilities, diagnostic methods and highly trained virology and medical science staff capable of handling Ebola and other viruses that cause viral haemorrhagic fever,' Prof Baggoley said.

The CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong will start working with ferrets to research potential Ebola vaccines because they have displayed human-like infections with other high-risk pathogens.

'All work with ebolaviruses is at the highest level of bio containment deep within AAHL’s solid walls and we must work on the virus wearing fully encapsulated suits with an external air supply,' Dr Marsh said.

'We are investigating the pathogenicity, or disease causing ability, of these virus strains to understand why the African strains have a high fatality rate in people, compared to the Asian strain, which does not cause human disease.'

'We believe that understanding the differences in virulence between these two closely related strains of ebolavirus may hold the key to developing an effective vaccine to prevent this deadly disease, or therapeutics to treat it.'
