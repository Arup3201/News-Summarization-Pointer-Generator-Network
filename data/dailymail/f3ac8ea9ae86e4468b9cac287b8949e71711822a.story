Patients should be charged £200 to see their GP so they 'learn to appreciate the NHS', fertility expert Robert Winston has said.

It comes after calls for patients to pay a £10-a-month fee to use health services, and  also be charged £20 for every night they stay in hospital.

But Labour peer Lord Winston said the actual value of a hospital was much greater- and the charge would have to be much higher to make it more 'realistic' for those who do not appreciate the cost.

He told The Sun: 'The actual value of a hospital appointment is about £200.

'This is for the time of the consultant and the investigations or tests that might be done.

'So paying £10 or £20 is really not an effective way of dealing with that deficit.'

There is rising concern that the NHS is running out of money and will 
soon have to resort to charging patients or rationing common treatments.

Former Labour health minister, Lord Warner, last month warned  the NHS was ‘unaffordable’, ‘out-of-date’ and unable to meet the needs of the population.

He said everyone should pay a £10-a-month fee to use the NHS, and he called for the levy to be paid before anyone could benefit from free treatment.

He said the controversial measures would prevent a financial crisis in the Health Service, which is struggling to meet the needs of the increasingly ageing, unhealthy population.

It came after members of the Royal College of Nursing called for patients to pay up to £10 to see their family doctor to generate vital NHS funding while also deterring patients from making appointments and then failing to show up, but later voted against it.

Senior GPs from the British Medical Association also called for fees arguing that they would encourage patients to go to their pharmacists and keep a supply of medicines at home.

In July, Care Minister Norman Lamb told an audience of Liberal Democrats that ‘absolutely vital services’ will have to be cut if the Health Service does not spend its £100billion-a-year budget more efficiently.

In a letter to the Times, health experts concurred with Mr Lamb on the scale of the black hole.

Senior figures including Sir Richard Thompson, president of the Royal College of Physicians, and Dr Maureen Baker, chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, warned that by 2020 the NHS will require an additional £30billion to maintain the current level of service provision.

‘The status quo is not an option,’ they wrote. ‘We are already seeing the signs of the system creaking at the seams.

‘All financial options are difficult politically; higher tax spend, co-payments or changes to what is available.’
