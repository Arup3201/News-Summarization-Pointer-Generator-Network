Britain's sporting heroes should wear the EU flag on their national team shirts under contentious plans passed by the European Parliament yesterday.

The measures stipulate that the EU's blue and yellow flag should be worn by all our teams - including football, rugby, cricket and the British Olympic team.

The EU flag should also be flown at major British sporting events such as the FA Cup Final, the Ashes series, Wimbledon and the British Grand Prix.

Flag bearer: England star Wayne Rooney could be forced to wear the European stars on his England shirt... which could look like our mocked-up image, right

To be flown: Britain's sporting heroes should wear the EU flag on their national team shirts under plans passed by the European Parliament yesterday

Following an outcry, MEPs have acknowledged that the measure should not be compulsory and individual member states will be given the final say over whether to display the flag.

The idea is contained in a report on 'The European Dimension In Sport' which was overwhelmingly approved by MEPs yesterday. The recommendations will now be considered by the European Commission.

Tory MEPs have furiously fought the proposals arguing that they are the latest example of Brussels attempting to impose itself on Britain's way of life.

The report suggests 'that the European flag should be flown at major international sports events held on the EU territory'.

It adds that sports should 'consider the idea of having it displayed on the clothing of athletes from Member States, alongside with the national flags; underlines that it should be entirely voluntary and up to Member States and sports organisations to decide whether they will use the aforementioned options.'

Argument: English demands to wear a poppy on shirts led to FIFA allowing this armband to be worn in November

The report also seeks to bar sports 
agents from operating anywhere in the EU unless they pay taxes there, a 
move likely to starve many top British sides of overseas talent, 
especially in cricket and rugby.

Brussels already has the power to fine organisations in certain circumstances for not flying the EU flag.

Recently,
it emerged that the University of Northampton was fined more than 
£56,000 for not displaying the EU logo to acknowledge it had received 
funding from the European Regional Development Fund.

Emma
McClarkin MEP, Conservative spokesman on culture, education and sport 
in the European Parliament, said the proposal was 'outrageous and 
unnecessary'.

'Sport has a 
special place in my country, and our national teams form a key part of 
our identities and heritage,' she told the parliament.

'The EU cannot impose an artificial European identity on us by forcing our athletes to wear its emblem.'

Bright idea: Members of the European Parliament attend a debate

She
added: 'The report also calls for any agent representing a sportsperson
who plays in Europe to have their fiscal residence in the EU; despite 
the fact that many players are not European and many sportspeople 
themselves have their fiscal residence outside the EU.

'Taxation
and legal frameworks operating at national level should be left alone -
it is up to each member state and the sport governing bodies to decide 
how they run their national sports.' 

Other
major proposals in the report include a call on national governments to
make trafficking of performance-enhancing drugs illegal and the 
creation of a European database of hooligans.
