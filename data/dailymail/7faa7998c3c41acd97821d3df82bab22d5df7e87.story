Swansea have completed the signing of free-agent midfielder Giancarlo Gallifuoco.

The 20-year-old was released by Tottenham in the summer after his contract expired and the Swans confirmed via their official website that he has signed a one-year contract at the Liberty Stadium.

Australia-born Gallifuoco will now link up with the club's Under-21 squad and he is eager to make an impact on first-team boss Garry Monk.

'I'm very excited,' he said. 'It's the perfect club for me to take the next step in my career and I can't wait to get started.

'I had a brief chat with Garry Monk and he said that there are opportunities at this club if I work hard and that's what I intend to do.

'I was excited when I learned of the club's interest and it's a Premier League club that plays brilliant football and I'm delighted to be here.'
