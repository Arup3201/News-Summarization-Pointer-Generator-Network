To say that Manchester City and Crystal Palace are teams moving in the opposite direction cannot be denied... especially from a platform at Manchester Piccadilly station.

The two Premier League sides passed each other on the concourse with champions City boarding the  train to London for their match with QPR while relegation candidates Palace alighted  to prepare for their meeting with Manchester United.

Players including Sergio Aguero, Joe Hart and Scott Dann smiled as they walked past each other in regimented lines not far removed from their usual pre-match ritual.

Managers Manuel Pellegrini (L) and Neil Warnock (2L) found the funny side of the situation

City were travelling to London for a meeting with QPR while Palace arrived in Manchester to face United

The players passed each other in lines that resembled a pre-match ritual at a Premier League match

Managers Neil Warnock and Manuel Pellegrini laughed at the situation while Argentinians Julian Speroni, Martin Demichelis and Willy Caballero found time for a chat.

City have headed south without their captain Vincent Kompany - who has been ruled out after picking up a calf injury in Wednesday night's Champions League defeat against CSKA Moscow.

The Belgian joins David Silva and Aleksandar Kolarov on the treatment table as City try to bounce back from their European embarrassment - giving a rare chance for £32million summer signing Eliaquim Mangala.

Yaya Toure is expected to captain the Premier League champions in the Belgian's absence

Either Yaya Toure or Pablo Zabaleta will captain the team at Loftus Road in Kompany's absence.

Meanwhile, Warnock believes Wayne Rooney will play a major role in turning Manchester United back into a title-winning force.

'I think he's been a mainstay in Man United and he will be instrumental in them getting right back to the top in the next two or three years,' Warnock said of the England captain - who is set to win his 100th cap next week. 

Eagles boss Neil Warnock has decided to stop complaining about referee's decisions this season

Palace have been left perilously close to the relegation zone following their previous loss to Sunderland

'I know he's on a lot of money and so he's open to criticism but, just the way he is, the fans love him and he comes back in and plays in midfield and he'll pop out wide and up front and he just wants to play.

'I think Wayne Rooney would play anywhere you want, he's such a good player. I always used to say about him when he first got started, I could just see him taking his shirt and shoes off and putting goalposts down in the park - he's that kind of player and his enthusiasm.'
