A man who accused former tennis champion Jennifer Capriati of beating him up has also claimed that she stalked him for a year.

Capriati, 36, allegedly got into an argument with ex-boyfriend Ivan Brannan, a former Florida State 
University golfer, on February 14 at a Palm Beach gym in Florida.

Brannan, 28, also claims that Capriati stalked him and called his work place more than 100 times in a single day last year.

Allegations: Ivan Brannan has accused ex-girlfriend Jennifer Capriati of beating him up at a Florida gym on Valentine's Day

Capriati reportedly turned up at Brannan’s workplace in January and banged on the windows, according to the New York Post.

The tennis pro has hired lawyer Steve Sessa
who said that the police report is 'one-sided' and the story which was 
circulating was an 'over-exaggeration'.

Brannan
asked the Palm Beach County Circuit Court for a restraining order 
against Capriati last year. The judge declined the request.

He
also says she sped through a security gate at his condo building in her
Porsche after a guard declined her requests to be let in.

Support: Christine Corley (right) the ex-girlfriend of Ivan Brannan, said that he had previously accused her of assaulting him after he called the police on his more recent ex, tennis pro Jennifer Capriati

The North Palm Beach Police Department did not respond to a request for comment.

However Brannan's ex-girlfriend has come to Capriati's defense, saying that he also tried to blame her for an attack.

Christine Corley, who starred on 
Gordon Ramsey's MasterChef, offered her support to Capriati via Twitter 
on Saturday, saying that her ex Brannan called the police on her, saying
that she had also stalked and assaulted him.

Florida police are considering charges 
of battery and stalking against Capriati in connection with the incident
at Oxygen Health and Fitness gym.

Capriati
allegedly hit 28-year-old Brannan's chest with her fists several times 
before a yoga instructor intervened. Brannan then ran into the men's 
locker room and called 911.

Capriati fled the scene in her car but was stopped by police a few miles away. They allowed her to go at the time.

Ms Corley, who has a three-year-old son with Brannan, tweeted on Saturday: 'See I'm not crazy! --- this is the father of my child --! HILARIOUS...'

The chef told Gossip Extra: 'He is doing to Jennifer Capriati what he did to me... This man is just a master manipulator.'

The single mother added that Brannan had accused her of hitting him but that no charges were ever filed.

Capriati was only ten when she made her Sports Illustrated debut and  by 13, she was on the cover.

She won Olympic gold in 1992 at age 16 and two years later, she was out of the game and into legal trouble when she was cited for shoplifting and arrested for marijuana possession.
