Holes in the walls, cracks in the plaster and peeling tiles are just three of a long list of problems one homeowner discovered when he moved into his £580,000 dream house.

Luke Mahon and his wife, Alison, 35, hoped the newly-built property would be the perfect place to start a family. But they soon uncovered major faults with their four-bedroom home - and have catalogued 140 since moving in five months ago.

And Mr Mahon, 45, is so frustrated with homebuilder Taylor Wimpey that he has set up a Twitter account to list them - and warn others off buying similar homes.

Freezing: Luke Mahon, 45, was shocked to discover the loft of his newly-built four-bedroom home, pictured, had not been fitted with insulation

Poorly finished: The £3,000 granite kitchen worktop if the £580,000 property, pictured, was not fitted properly, leaving gaps between two pieces

Sludge: The Mahons also discovered that no turf had been laid in the garden - just one of 140 faults they uncovered in the property

The couple first found signs of wear and tear - including cracks in the walls and plaster - shortly after moving in to the home at Woodley, Berkshire, last September. 

They also encountered bigger problems, such as a badly-fitted £3,000 granite kitchen unit and a misplaced toilet, in the detached home.

And when temperatures started to plummet last winter, marketing director Mr Mahon discovered his home - which was advertised as being 'energy efficient' - had not been fitted with loft insulation.

He has created a Twitter account to vent his frustration, and publicly document the long list of problems that he claims have yet to be fixed. 

Desperate: This photograph, which appears to show poorly-finished floorboards, was captioned with the words 'please fix our house!'

Warning: The toilet is off-centre, left, and, right, the photographs and notice the Mahons' posted on their windows to publicise their problems

'Gaping holes': This photograph shows a corner of the house that appears to be exposed to the outside, it was posted on Twitter by Mr Mahon

Using the account @MyHouseSucks, Mr Mahon shares photographs taken inside his home along with captions explaining what is wrong. 

No loft insulation 

Poorly-fitted kitchen counter

No grass in the garden

Gaping hole in corner of one wall

Off-centre toilet 

Unfinished floor

Faulty bathroom mastic

Peeling plaster and paintwork

Cracks on toilet floor

Gaps in bathroom sealant

Wonky doors 

Ill-fitting toilets 

Not energy efficient  

He said: 'I shouldn't have to resort to these sorts of measures to get something done. 

'I'm really disappointed because we were told we'd have a new home that would not need any work as we want to start a family. We lived in Caversham for seven years and did a lot of work on it. We didn't want to live in a building site again, and that's what's happened.' 

The couple have even posted the photos in the windows of their home along with a warning to house-hunters hoping to buy a property in the same new development.

And the Mahons are not the only couple to have experienced problems since moving to the 48-home estate. Jason and Tracey Bass said their home has been a constant building site since they moved in last summer. 

The couple have had three separate patios installed in just six months after bodged building work meant rainwater kept flowing into their garage and flooding it.

Mr Bass said: 'We haven't found anyone living here who is happy.

'The site manager told one lady who lives on her own that they are building water-tight properties, not Rolls Royces. But we are paying Rolls Royce prices. It's disgraceful.'

Mrs Bass added: 'We have reached rock bottom with the circumstances that we find ourselves in.'

House builder Taylor Wimpey insists it is constantly working with residents to repair faults.

A spokesman said: 'We would like to apologise to Mr Mahon and his wife for the issues they have experienced with their new home. We are in regular contact with the customers, and have met with them to discuss their specific concerns. 

'During these meetings we have agreed the work that will be undertaken to resolve the issues and we will complete this as soon as possible.'

Improved: Mr Mahon posted this picture on Twitter of what the mastic in his house looks like after Taylor Wimpey had promised to fix it

Frustrated: Marketing manager Luke Mahon, left, and one of the photographs of peeling paint he posted using the @MyHouseSucks account

Major problems: Another photograph taken inside the loft reveals the lack of insulation. It is one of 48 homes on the new development

Fault: This photograph taken in the Mahons' poorly-finished bathroom was captioned 'more quality fit and finish from @TaylorWimpey'

Mocking: Mr Mahon posted this picture with the caption 'when trimming doors most builders use straight cuts. Not @TaylorWimpey'

Unfinished: The 45-year-old said that this toilet was one of the 'better fitted ones' in their new home in Woodley, Berkshire
