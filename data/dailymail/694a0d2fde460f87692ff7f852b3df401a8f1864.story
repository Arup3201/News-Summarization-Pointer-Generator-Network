The son of disgraced former television chef Paula Deen has spoken out about the racism scandal that caused the Southern matriarch's empire to spiral out of control last year.

'It was a tough summer, but it’s made us stronger as a family ... We are good members of the community and our attitude is to learn from our mistakes and go forward,' Jamie Deen told Closer magazine.

Deen, 66, had her show cancelled and many of her paid endorsement deals dropped last year as it was revealed that she used racial slurs in discussing black employees.

She retreated from public life for months and spent time with her family, including sons Jamie and Bobby who are also chefs and have been closely involved in her ventures.

'She’s always been true to herself and she can really brighten up someone’s week just by spending time with them,' Jamie said.

'She’s authentic.

'We look forward to getting back to work and persevering...We are going to have a big year in 2014!'

Her official website suggests that the comeback is going to start very soon, as she is scheduled as headlining her own cruise trip starting on the 18th and heading to San Juan, St Thomas and St Maarten.

She will then be returning to the U.S. a week later and has her next publicly advertised event in February as she will be signing cookbooks in Buffalo, New York on February 8.

The former Food Network star has made only a handful of appearances since she broke down in tears on The Today Show while giving a public apology for the racism scandal.

In September, she signed copies of her cookbook at her Savannah restaurant, The Lady & Sons.

'Yes I'm back,' she told a local television station at the time.

'Well actually, I never went anywhere. I just took a little breather.'

Showing her face: Deen made her first public appearance following the scandal at the Metropolitan Cooking & Entertaining Show in Houston, Texas in September but there are many more events planned this year

At the event, Deen put a positive spin on her time off.

'I’ve been on the road for so long. So it has been wonderful to reconnect with my team and everything that is going on with my business,' she said.

Her first official appearance came the weekend before that, where she couldn't help but cry on stage at a cooking show in Houston, but she said that they were happy tears.

'These are tears of joy, y'all,' 66-year-old Deen told the audience of 1,500 supporters at the Reliant Center. 'I've said all along that the one place I'd want to make my first step back out is Texas. Y'all's hearts are as big as your state.'

Deen admitted in her deposition for the lawsuit that she had used the N-word on a number of occasions, and even wanted black employees to play the part of slaves in a wedding party she was planning, according to a National Enquirer report.
