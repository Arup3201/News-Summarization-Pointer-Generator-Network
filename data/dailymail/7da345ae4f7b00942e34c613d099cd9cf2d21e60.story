Sara McKenna dated Bode Miller for 3 months in 2012

Bode Miller's ex-lover has claimed the Olympic skier said he wanted a large family with her - before she fell pregnant and he told her to have an abortion.

Sara McKenna, 27, gave birth to their son  Samuel Bode Miller-McKenna earlier this year following a three month courtship and moved from San Diego to New York to attend Columbia University.

But after initially saying he wanted her to have an abortion, Miller, 35, is now fighting her for joint custody, and a judge ruled she must return to California for the battle, which forces her to give up her studies.

McKenna, a former Marine and firefighter, revealed that they only had sex twice - and that he failed to use protection as he assumed she was ready to get pregnant, she said.

'You have to agree to have four of my babies,' Miller texted McKenna, she told the New York Daily News, after they met on a high-priced dating service.

After they met up in California, they went their separate ways, and she said he was reluctant to continue a relationship because he wanted a large family, and she did not.

But a few weeks later, they organized to meet up in Florida - and a second tryst led to her falling pregnant with baby Samuel.

Newlywed: Bode Miller married Morgan Beck in October 2012 (the couple at the Kentucky Derby in May). They were expected a child but in January Beck suffered a miscarriage

'He never offered to use a condom,' McKenna said. 'He assumed I was ready to get pregnant.'

After she fell pregnant, she moved to New York - and Miller married volleyball player Morgan Beck.

McKenna said that she is a devout 
Catholic and has alleged that Miller wanted nothing to do with the 
pregnancy and even encouraged her to have an abortion.

Beck and Miller married in October 2012 and announced they were expecting a child, but Beck suffered a miscarriage in January.

Days after the devastating
news, Miller filed court documents to gain joint custody of his son with 
McKenna, the child he has never met.

McKenna, left and right, dated Bode Miller for 3
months in 2012 when she lived in San Diego. On her Twitter profile she 
says she is a 'firefighter, helicopter pilot, former U.S. Marine, model,
Ivy leaguer, and mommy'

Baby Bode: McKenna moved to New York while she was pregnant - but now must return to California

Miller sought to force a 
judge to get McKenna to move back to California, so he can have 
relationship with the child. He has also sought to have the boy's last name changed to Miller, on his birth certificate.

Earlier this month McKenna appeared 
in Manhattan Family Court as Miller's lawyers argued that the custody 
case for the pair's infant son should be moved to California, a state 
with more generous custody rights, where the skier lives.

McKenna, told the New York Post that she was already $35,000 in debt from legal bills.

'I can’t afford to be flying back and forth to California,' she said.

Manhattan Family Court referee 
Fiordaliza Rodriguez ruled yesterday that McKenna’s 'appropriation of a 
child while in utero was irresponsible and reprehensible.'

Devastated: Bode Miller, with his volleyball star wife Morgan Beck, was devastated after the couple lost the child in January

Lawyer's for the Olymipian told a judge earlier this month: 'New York is an inconvenient forum.'

'Why
did she make a very precipitous decision to apply to a college 3,000 
miles away?' the athlete’s attorney, Barbara Schaffer said.

'It’s no secret New York does not have a presumption as California does of joint custody.'

The lawyer representing McKenna said that it is too late for Miller to try to seek joint custody. 

'If
you look at the texts [messages] from Bode Miller to my client, he 
wanted nothing to do with the baby,' attorney Kenneth Eiges said.

Her lawyer also defended his client's right to live in New York saying it was 'her right.'

Previously, McKenna tried to block Miller's attempts at custody, claiming in a court filing that the famed Olympic skier should not have joint custody of her son because he lives on a yacht and has substance abuse problems.

Daddy: Bode Miller also has a 4-year-old daughter, Neesyn Darcey, from a previous relationship with Chanel Johnson

Miller has also 
filed for joint legal and physical custody as well as child support 
payments for a child by another woman - Chanel Johnson.

Johnson,
now married, is the mother of Miller’s four-year-old daughter Neesyn 
Dacey.

According to Miller, the two are friends and he was involved in 
naming the little girl.

Miller
has won five Olympic medals – including a gold at the 2010 Vancouver 
Games, holds four World Championships and 33 World Cup wins, which is an
American men's record.

He 
recently announced his intention to sit this season out as he is 
recovering from knee surgery and determined to compete in the 2014 
Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.
