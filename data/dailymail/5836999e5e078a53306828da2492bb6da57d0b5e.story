Takera-Tomy was certainly on to something when it created Transformers in 1975. 

Now, thanks to a new U.S. military research project, the toys could soon be moving out of the playroom and onto the battle field.

A group at the Sandia National Laboratories in California has created something called the ‘Multi-Modal Vehicle Concept’.

The Sandia National Laboratories in California has created something called the 'Multi-Modal Vehicle Concept'

The concept is an unmanned vehicle designed to operate in missions where you have to covertly fly into an area, traverse through water, across land, and overcome obstacles along the way.

The flying vehicles wings become fins and paddles as it moves into water.

It can then shed its outer skin to reveal wheels that move the vehicle forward on the seabed and out onto land.

'While the concept may appear to be off in the distant future, our testing has shown that this concept could soon be a reality,' said Sandia National Laboratories on their website

These wheels, according to Sandia National Laboratories in California, have the ability to hop 30 feet into the air.

Jon Salton, a Sandia engineer working on the project, told Wired that the real value of the vehicle is to offer maximum flexibility in highly complex missions.

He added that it could enhance the significantly capabilities of Special Ops

So far, Sandia has built and conducted testing on prototype hardware.

It now hopes to secure funding for the prototype and gain help from industry partners to turn it into a reality.

The government-funded group recently unveiled the concept of nuclear-powered drone, which could fly for months without needing to refuel.It is also working on a small, shoebox-sized, GPS guided ground vehicle that can jump over and onto obstacles more than six meters high.

Despite a history of outlandish concepts, Sandia claims its latest Transformers vehicle isn’t as blue-skies as it may first seem.

‘While the concept may appear to be off in the distant future, our testing has shown that this concept could soon be a reality,’ it said.
