Payoff: Rebekah Brooks resigned from News International at the height of the phone hacking scandal

Former News of the World editor 
Rebekah Brooks has walked away with £1.7million and a chauffeur-driven 
limousine in a controversial pay-off deal.

The News International former chief 
executive, who was arrested in July this year by detectives 
investigating phone hacking and illegal bungs to police, has received a 
bumper severance package from the newspaper group.

The 43-year-old, who resigned at the 
height of the phone-hacking scandal, received £1.7million in cash, the 
use of a London office and a company limousine and chauffeur for two 
years as part of the deal.

Just days after she quit, she was arrested and is still on police bail.

But News International will continue 
to pay for her office in an expensive central London location for 
another two years, raising suspicion that she will be allowed to return 
to the firm.

The controversial decision to give 
her an office is likely to come under scrutiny on Thursday when James 
Murdoch, the 38-year-old son of Rupert Murdoch and chairman of News 
International, returns to answer questions at the Commons culture, media
and sport select committee about his knowledge of phone hacking.

There have been reports that Mrs 
Brooks, a favourite of Rupert Murdoch, was told she would one day be 
able to return to the company, possibly in as little as two years. Mr 
Murdoch is said to have told her to ‘travel the world’ until the scandal
died down.

Records at Companies House show that she has now resigned from 23 directorships related to the firm.

Labour MP Tom Watson said today: ‘It is remarkably curious that such a generous package is given to Mrs Brooks when others have been cut loose.

‘It is almost as if she hasn’t really left the company.

'I am sure Mr Murdoch will want to explain the decision to his shareholders.’

Dave Wilson, the chairman of Bell Pottinger, the public relations group hired by Mrs Brooks to deal with the fallout from her resignation, declined to comment on the confidential details of her severance package.

News International also declined to comment.

Mrs Brooks has been bailed to return in March next year.
