Feline good: Sporting a tartan tie, Hank the cat poses for his official campaign photo which helped to propel him to third place in the race for the U.S. Senate seat in Virginia

Unsurprisingly, the race for the White House grabbed all the headlines during this year's Presidential elections.

But at the same time, another politician was making a name for himself as he clawed for his own slice of power.

Running with the message of 'vote the humans out', Hank the cat secured an impressive third place in the battle for the U.S. Senate seat in Virginia after receiving nearly 7,000 votes.

The
nine-year-old Maine Coon from Springfield found himself in the election
spotlight as part of a spoof campaign run by his owner manager Matthew 
O'Leary, who launched Hank's own website and Twitter feed and even produced a video trailer.

Hank
eventually lost out to Democrat Tim Kaine, who beat rival Republican 
George Allen to the Senate by a margin of 200,000 votes.

But the prank did serve a more serious purpose by helping to raise more than $16,000 for animal rescue groups.

After
the election, a Chicago supporter filed an online petition asking that 
President Barack Obama 'make Hank the Cat an honorary member of the 
United States' Senate'.

To have a chance to being reviewed by the White House, it would have needed 25,000 signatures.

But a few days later it was taken down 
because it was 'in violation of our Terms of Participation', according 
to a note on the White House's We The People website.

Defeated, but with no loss of pride, Hank announced last week that he 'would be taking a break from politics', it was reported on The Huffington Post.

Writing on his Facebook page, he said: 'When I started this campaign, I was just a cat - a wonderful, fluffy, cute cat, no doubt.

'But today, I now belong to each and every one of you, and I will continue to be yours for all time.'

He has not ruled out a return to politics, however, and insists that public 'will certainly be the first to know' if he does.
