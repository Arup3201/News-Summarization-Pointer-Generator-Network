First steps, first words, first birthdays.

One camcorder captured every little moment of Mark Christini's young Pennsylvania family from 1995 to 1998.

When he left it - and a bag of tapes - on a New Jersey beach during a holiday, they consigned themselves to the fact that all was lost.

But now, 16 years later, every single tape has been discovered in the disused attic of office owned by Jenkinson's Boardwalk, the beach.

Memories: The home videos charted every little family moment on one camcorder

Determined to return the videos to their rightful owner, Jenkinson's Boardwalk employee Dan Camano launched a Facebook appeal - and found them.

Mr Christini and his wife, whose infant daughters are now 20 and 22, now have an 11-year-old daughter as well.

The blast from the past took them completely offguard.

'At first, complete surprise, and then just gratitude,' Mr Christini told ABC News today of how he felt when he heard the news.

Complete surprise: 16 years later, Christini, his wife and his daughters were shocked to find the footage

Discovery: Dan Camano, who worked on the beach, put out a Facebook appeal to find the family

'It's a story of someone doing something extra special to try to help somebody out. And we're just incredibly thankful.'

Camano told the station the camera had stopped working so he bought another to play the tapes and find the owner.

He told Facebook users the last name 'Christini' is mentioned, and one of their followers found Mark.

'We put up a picture of the camera in the bag and the tapes,' Camano said. 'We did it as a throwback Thursday post.'

'We had a bunch of amateur detectives on our side on Facebook trying to Google these names and places,' he said. 'Someone found this guy, Mark, and his family.'
