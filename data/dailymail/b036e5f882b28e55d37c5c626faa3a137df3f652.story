A teenage babysitter has been arrested and charged in the death of a five-year-old boy who shot himself with her gun as she took a nap.

Melissa Ann Ringhardt, 19, was looking after John Read on Monday afternoon in Vidor, Texas, and  left her .40-caliber handgun on a coffee table when she went into a bedroom.

She awoke when she heard a noise and then discovered the child dead in the living room.

Ringhardt could not call the emergency services from the home because it did not have a phone, so she was forced to carry the child and an unidentified six-month-old baby to the child's grandparents' house, reported NBC News.

Ringhardt told investigators she had the pistol because she was scared to be at home alone.

12NewsNow reported that the family did have a gun locked away in a safe.

Ringhardt had been living at the home for the past few months.

She is being held in the Orange County Jail on a felony charge of abandoning or endangering a child, the county sheriff's office said in a statement.

She could face a sentence of six months to two years if convicted.

'People
 have the right to bear arms, and with that comes great responsibility,'
 Orange County sheriff's Chief Deputy Clint Hodgkinson told KFDM-TV of 
Beaumont.

'If someone, somehow, puts a firearm in a place where a child is able to get that weapon, you've committed an offense.'

'Sometimes, it takes something like this — as tragic as it is — for people to reflect on those things, and these are the opportunities you take ... to say, 'Look, what could we have done?'' Hodgkinson said.
