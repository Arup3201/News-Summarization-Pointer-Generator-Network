Security has been tightened at Manila’s international airport after Philippine authorities arrested three men and foiled an alleged plot to set off homemade bombs at the airport and other locations.

Four incendiary devices were found inside the suspects’ van at a car park at Ninoy Aquino International Airport, officials announced on Tuesday.

While holidaymakers are noticing tighter security precautions following the threat, airport operations remain normal and there are no reports of any domestic or international flight delays due to the heightened level of caution.

Busted: Philippine authorities say three men were plotting to attack the airport and other locations in Manila 

The Manila International Airport Authority assured locals and visitors that all of the country's airports are safe for travellers.

In response to the threat, plainclothes and uniformed officers are guarding entrances, K9 units are patrolling terminals to detect explosives and authorities have increased inspections of vehicles entering the airport.

The alleged plot unravelled when government agents were tipped off by an informant, although the country’s military is downplaying the threat and claiming the men are ‘pranksters’ who were just seeking attention.

The men have been linked to an anti-China group, which calls itself Usafe. They are also accused of planning attacks against the Chinese Embassy in Manila and a major shopping centre that has ethnic Chinese owners.

Justice Secretary Leila de Lima said the ‘ultra-rightist’ but ‘misguided group’ is angry because it believes the Philippine government is taking a ‘very soft’ stance in its territorial dispute with China.

The suspects, including the group’s alleged leader, are now facing charges of illegal possession of a firearm and an incendiary device, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The men could face charges of conspiracy to commit terrorism, authorities said.

Rommel Vallejo, head of the Anti-Organized Crime Division of the National Bureau of Investigation, said the firebombs consisted of a firecracker as big as the palm of hand with an eight-second wick taped to a plastic bottle containing gasoline.

De Lima said the blast from one of the devices could create a huge fireball and send debris flying 15 to 30ft, which could cause fatal injuries.
