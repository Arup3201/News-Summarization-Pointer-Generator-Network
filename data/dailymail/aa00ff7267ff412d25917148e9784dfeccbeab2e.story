A 57-year-old man charged with bludgeoning three elderly neighbors to death has been held without bail.

Salvatore Guglielmino of North Andover, Massachusetts, allegedly killed Walter Hamilton, 78, George Kettinger Jr., 79, and Frank Kort, 68, at their homes on Tuesday morning with no apparent motive.

Authorities say the victims, who lived at a senior housing complex at Foulds Terrace, had blunt force trauma injuries to their faces and no weapon was recovered.

Triple-murder charges: Salvatore Guglielmino, 57, of North Andover, Massachusetts, attends his arraignment hearing at Lawrence District Court, Wednesday, January 7

No apparent motive: He allegedly killed 78-year-old Walter Hamilton, 79-year-old George Kettinger Jr., and 68-year-old Frank Kort at their homes on Tuesday morning 

Guglielmino's uncle, Angelo Guglielmino, 81, told the Boston Herald that the family are 'shocked' and 'devastated' by his actions.

Other neighbors described the alleged killer as a 'gentle giant' who 'cared' for his aging mother.

'Everybody knew [Salvatore] everybody. He was big. He was nice. And I’m telling you, he loved his mother,' Patricia Bonanno told the Boston Globe.

Family members say Guglielmino was taking medications for manic depression and bipolar disorder. 

At his arraignment hearing in Lawrence District Court on Wednesday he appeared to be dazed as he stood before the judge wearing a grey tracksuit.

'We have no motive at this time that we can comment on,' Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said at a news conference Tuesday afternoon. 

On call: North Andover authorities are shown near the scene of a triple homicide 

Recovered: The bodies of the victims were found in a unit on Foulds Terrace, which is a public housing complex for the elderly and disabled

Guglielmino apparently had 'no recent history' with the police.

The four men he allegedly murdered lived in different units in the same building.

According to the police report, Guglielmino told his sister on Tuesday he 'kicked down three doors and killed three people.'

However, defense attorney John Morris says his client denies committing a crime.

Guglielmino is due back in court next month. 

He faces charges for triple-murder and breaking and entering with a maximum sentence being life imprisonment without parole.
