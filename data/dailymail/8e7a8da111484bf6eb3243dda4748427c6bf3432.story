The Bishops Avenue, which runs between 
Hampstead Heath and East Finchley, attracts wealthy buyers thanks to its
 large houses and extensive gardens, which gives it a rural atmosphere 
despite its relatively central location.

However, in spite of its popularity - some might say notoriety - living on Bishops Avenue might be quieter than you might think.

In February MailOnline reported that at least 16 properties - with a combined value of an estimated £350million - on the street are currently standing empty after being abandoned by their super-wealthy owners.

A third of homes on the Avenue's most expensive stretch have been unoccupied for up to 25 years, with rooms taken over by plants, according to the investigation.

Even those houses which have not been abandoned are unoccupied much of the time, according to residents, as they have been bought by rich foreigners who usually live abroad.

The sky-high prices are one clue to why so many of the houses are empty, as the homes are unaffordable for nearly all Londoners, meaning they end up being bought by overseas royals and oligarchs who maintain their main residence elsewhere.
