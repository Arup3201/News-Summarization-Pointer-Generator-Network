Crystal Palace are set to complete the signing of Marouane Chamakh in the next 48 hours.

The Moroccan spent last season at Selhurst Park joining from Arsenal and scored five league goals to help Palace stay in the top-flight.

The deal that saw Chamakh move across London has now expired but Palace boss Tony Pulis is keen on extending the forward's stay at the club.

Palace are in advanced talks with Chamakh and are close to agreeing a two-year deal with the forward, understood to be in the region of Â£40,000-per-week.

Chamakh was on Â£70,000-per-week at the Emirates Stadium but is willing to take the wage slash to sign for the Eagles.

Despite allowing the player leave on a free, Arsenal paid a significant percentage of Chamakh's wages last season given the striker's reluctance to forgo the final year of his lucrative Gunners deal.
