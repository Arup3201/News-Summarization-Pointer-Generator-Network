A heart-wrenching statement has been released by the parents of the three Maslin children, who died when Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine in July.

Anthony Maslin and Marite Norris' heartfelt words about Mo,12, Evie, 10, and Otis, 8 have been released by the Department of Foreign Affairs on Sunday after their bodies finally arrived back on Australian soil on Thursday.

The spine-tingling words succinctly describe the horror that the parents have been living every single second since the tragedy on July 17 that robbed them of their three young children's lives and their grandfather Nick Norris.

'For the last three months, they have been lying in a cold room on the other side of the world,' the statement said.

'Reconciling this fact with the knowledge that our children are here with us, spiritually, every moment is one of the most relentless and agonizing difficulties of our current life.'

'For the last three months, they have been lying in a cold room on the other side of the world,' their parents said in a statement about Mo, 12 (centre), Evie, 10 (left) and Otis, 8 (right)

'Our lives are an ongoing hell. The pain we are enduring is unfathomable,' Anthony Maslin (right) and Marite Norris (left) said to describe the surreal world they been forced to now live in

Each child was honoured in the statement beginning with their eldest son, Mo,12, who they described as having a 'compassionate heart' and possessing 'total selflessness'. 

'Mo is peaceful and inclusive. Mo can accept people of all ages and backgrounds, make them feel special, and have them know they are with someone extraordinary.'

While their only daughter, Evie, 12 was described as having 'boundless and unlimited love.'

'She is empathetic, beautiful, funny, artistic and creative. Her gentle spirit, warmth and absolute kindness are recognized by all who know her.'

Last but definitely not least were their heartfelt words for their youngest son Otis, 8. 

'We honour Otis and his complete and humbling fascination with all things outdoors, big and small, near and far. Oti provides all of us with carefree joy and laughter – perhaps the most powerful gift of all.'

'Our lives are an ongoing hell. The pain we are enduring is unfathomable,' they added to describe the surreal world they been forced to now live in.'

'No hate in the world is as strong as the love we have for our children, for Mo (left), for Evie (centre), for Otis (right)' their parents said

The grief-stricken parents went on to mention the senseless act of war that has scarred their lives forever.

'Our children were taken from us by a war in which we, and our country had no part. It is impossible to understand the reason they were blown out of the sky,' they said.

'No hate in the world is as strong as the love we have for our children, for Mo, for Evie, for Otis.'

It simply then ended with the words: 'Love, only love, it is all we have left.'

'We have brought home the bodies of our children, Mo, Evie and Otis Maslin (aged 12, 10 and 8) from the Netherlands, along with their grandfather, Nick Norris. For the last three months, they have been lying in a cold room on the other side of the world. Reconciling this fact with the knowledge that our children are here with us, spiritually, every moment is one of the most relentless and agonizing difficulties of our current life.

Our love and respect for our children remains unlimited and unconditional. It will never weaken – our children have been our entire world.

We have been two of the luckiest and happiest people on the planet. What remains for us now is to honour our children.

We honour Mo – his wisdom, his compassionate heart, and his total selflessness. Mo is peaceful and inclusive. Mo can accept people of all ages and backgrounds, make them feel special, and have them know they are with someone extraordinary.

We honour Evie and her boundless, unlimited love. She is empathetic, beautiful, funny, artistic and creative. Her gentle spirit, warmth and absolute kindness are recognized by all who know her.

We honour Otis and his complete and humbling fascination with all things outdoors, big and small, near and far. Oti provides all of us with carefree joy and laughter – perhaps the most powerful gift of all.

Our children were taken from us by a war in which we, and our country had no part. It is impossible to understand the reason they were blown out of the sky.

Our lives are an ongoing hell. The pain we are enduring is unfathomable, and we grieve alongside families in the Ukraine, the Netherlands, Russia, Malaysia, Australia and elsewhere.

Please respect our children's memory, and stop this pointless war.

No hate in the world is as strong as the love we have for our children, for Mo, for Evie, for Otis.

No hate in the world is as strong as the love we have for Grandad Nick.

No hate in the world is as strong as the love we have for each other.

Thanks to DFAT and their international support team. Thanks also to our friends and our family for their support and love. Love, only love, it is all we have left.

Mo, Evie and Otis were three of 38 Australians who died in the disaster which claimed a total of 298 lives when a surface-to-air-missile shot the passenger plane out of the sky. 

Families of the deceased were seen waiting at Melbourne airport as the plane arrived and watched on as the coffins were removed from the plane.

A total of 10 hearses were then seen making their way to Melbourne Coroner's Court where the certification process will take place before the victim's remains can be received by their loved ones.

The Herald Sun reports that 27 victims have already been returned to Australia and only two more still require identification in Eindhoven.

In July, the parents of the three Maslin children released a statement addressed to 'the soldiers in the Ukraine, the politicians, the media, our friends and family'.

Anthony Maslin and Marite Norris wrote: 'Our pain is intense and relentless. We live in a hell beyond hell.

'Our babies are not here with us – we need to live with this act of horror, every day and every moment for the rest of our lives. 

'No one deserves what we are going through. Not even the people who shot our whole family out of the sky.'
