The New Zealand bar manager who was arrested in December in Myanmar for insulting the Buddhist religion after publishing a psychedelic image of Buddha wearing headphones to promote his bar in Yangon is still no nearer being freed.

Philip Blackwood was led back to jail by police after another court hearing in Yangon on Tuesday. Last December a Myanmar court denied the bar manager bail. The New Zealander has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

He was charged in December, along two local men, over the publication of a poster promoting cheap drinks at his bar. If found guilty, they face up to four years in jail.

Blackwood told the court on December 26 that he had removed the image from the bar’s Facebook page, and posted an apology once he realised that it was being shared widely online, provoking outrage.

'I believe the law says the act must be deliberate, require malice with intent to offend,' Blackwood said. 'I have said a number of times, there was no intent.'

Blackwood’s lawyer, Mya Thway, said he had received anonymous messages on Facebook threatening to cut him to pieces and burn him because he’d taken on the case.

The Dominion Post in New Zealand reported that in a recent post on Facebook, his mother, Angela Blackwood, said they had received a moving letter from her son, who was being supported by the International Red Cross while in jail.

The 32-year-old New Zealander was arrested by Myanmar police in early December, along with owner Tun Thurein, 40, and manager Htut Ko Ko Lwin, 26, after an official from Myanmar's Religious Department complained about the advertising. The bar has since been shuttered-up.

'They were trying to promote the bar. Buddha grabs people's interest... however, Buddhists cannot accept it,' a police official told reporters. 

The trio were charged for breaching the country's Religion Act.

According to the Act, anyone who attempts to insult, destroy or damage any religion can be punished by a maximum of two years in jail, with another two-year penalty for those who try to insult religion through the written word. 

Around 30 monks and 20 ordinary citizens gathered at the court in December when the three men were first charged.

'The whole public was insulted by the posting of the improper Buddha photograph,' a monk called Thusita from the Burmese Patriot Monks Union told reporters at the time.

'We will wait and see what action the authorities take. We will do what we need to, if the authorities do not take action,' he added.

The offending image was quickly removed from the bar's Facebook page and replaced by an apology from VGastro Management expressing 'sincere regret' for having offended 'the citizens of this wonderful city.'

'Our ignorance is embarrassing for us,' read the statement. 

But the apology attracted a slew of angry comments from Burmese social media users including one which decried the bar management as 'utterly unprofessional and culturally insensitive.'

V Gastro bar, which opened in December, swiftly deleted the insulting image and posted this apology on its Facebook page

The arrests come as Myanmar grapples with a growing Buddhist nationalist movement, spearheaded by extremist monks who have urged boycotts of Muslim shops and proposed a raft of laws to restrict religious freedoms.

Their rise has accompanied several bouts of religious violence between Muslims and Buddhists.

The arrests come during a surge of religious nationalism in Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country
