Children run across a thick blanket of snow. Christmas trees, snowmen and snowball fights. 

But this is no winter wonderland. This is Dubai. And December temperatures are regularly in the mid 20s.

So at this Christmas festival the snow is made by a machine. 

Children from all religions came together to celebrate the Dubai Christmas Festival

Festive celebrations abound in the United Arab Emirates, home to more than a hundred different nationalities. And people of all religions are getting involved. 

Nikul Patel is a Indian Hindu who grew up in the USA and his wife Zainab is a Muslim who grew up in the UAE.

'You know Christmas was just sitting around all day and eating and watching movies and now we have a kid and it's about him and sharing that experience and making sure he understands it. Christmas is not for us about a religion but it's a time to just celebrate,' he said. 

Bands play Christmas music for the crowds. People from all over the world are joining in the fun at the Dubai Christmas Fest. 

Event organisers put the ongoing successes of the Christmas festival down to the people of Dubai 'loving a good celebration'

A machine produced enough synthetic snow so the children (and probably adults) could build snowmen

'Very good, I think it's very good to get together all the people from all religions. I mean it's a nice thing,' says Yuksel Karakoc, who's originally from Turkey. 

Retailers sell tinsel and other decorations. And children visit Santa and his elves. 

Chris Fountain, managing director of Turret Media, which organises the Dubai Christmas Fest, explains why the event is so popular. 

'It's an amazing family festival. It's grown year on year. I think everyone from all nationalities, all walks of life in Dubai enjoys a good celebration,' he said. 

Christmas is big business for Dubai's shopping malls too. At the Mall of the Emirates dancers perform a scene from Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker, a favourite ballet during the festive season. 

And shoppers come to see the lavish decorations and massive Christmas tree. 

Dubai is a Muslim country, but research suggests Muslims enjoy the annual festival

According to Euromonitor International, UAE retail spending during December rises to US$3 billion (£1.3billion), an increase of half a billion dollars on the average monthly spending rate. 

Outgoings on food also increase during December - up by more than US$1 billion (£64million) from the average month. 

Hussein Doughan, country manager for Euromonitor International, says the popularity of Christmas is a relatively new phenomenon. 

'Dubai is a Muslim country but Muslims and non-Muslims are enjoying the festival. There are decorations in the malls and Christmas trees across the city. Compared to ten years ago it is a big change,' he said. 

It might provide good business opportunities, but for many it's just a chance to have some fun.
