Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson has put his old Mercedes up for sale for just £13,990 - a fraction of the price he paid for it.

Clarkson bought the motor in 2002, spending almost £100,000 on the sporty Mercedes SL55 AMG.

The TV star even took it onto Top Gear to review, describing the German convertible as the 'Swiss army knife' of the car world.

Car buyers looking for some Top Gear should look no further than this motor - Jeremy Clarkson's old Mercedes

He said: 'It's a top down funster, a long distance cruiser, a muscle car, a Messerschmitt, pose mobile.'

Under the bonnet of the Mercedes is a 5.5-litre supercharged V8 engine which develops a whopping 500bhp.

With this oomph, Clarkson could scream power as it accelerated from 0-62mph in 4.9 seconds and all the way to a limited top speed of 155mph.

It has a TV, a voice activated CD player, phone, leather seats and all-round electrics.
