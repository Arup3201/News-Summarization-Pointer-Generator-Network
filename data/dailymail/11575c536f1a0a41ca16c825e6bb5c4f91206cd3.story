Top orthopaedic surgeon Andrew Scott Martin, 47, was arrested after trying to give MDMA to an undercover officer and offering them sex at one of his adult events.

His wife Jennifer Martin, 36, and six other people have also been charged with a variety of drug offences after they were spotted by the covert cops.

The Howard Medical School graduate is facing 10 drug charges, including three counts of trafficking a controlled substance, and years in prison.

Foiled: Top orthopedic surgeon Andrew Scott Martin, 47, from Las Vegas was arrested after trying to give MDMA to an undercover officer and offering them sex at one of his events

The Howard Medical School graduate (mughshot pictured left) and his wife Jennifer Martin (mugshot right) hosted the sex-fuelled parties at their Las Vegas home. It was raided in September and police found drugs 

His illicit parties were foiled by an undercover operation which began when police created a covert adult website. 

In late 2013, they were then invited to a 'Frost and Furs' party at the home Martin shared with spouse, who is also known as Jennifer Lynn Taylor. The property is estimated to be worth more than $3million. 

They had some knowledge of the level of narcotics that were being distributed at the events, but police said they group had been 'difficult to infiltrate'.  

Undercover cops posing as a couple dressed up and attended the event.

According to the Las Vegas Review Journal officer Cynthia Hurtado, one of the undercover officers told a grand jury: 'It was a swingers lifestyle party, which means people, couples had intercourse with each other.'

The pair were forced to leave when the party started getting physical, but one was offered Molly, a colloquial term for MDMA, by a reveller before they departed. 

Hurtado added: 'It lowers your inhibitions, so that’s why people take them. They want to get sexual and stuff like that.' 

According to police, Martin, who was referred to as Scotty by attendees, subsequently invited the pair to another party at the Trump Hotel in January 2014.

He whispered them a password: Fidelio - the title of a Ludwig van Beethoven opera also known as Leonore, or The Triumph of Married Love.

The theme of the night was Eyes Wide Shut - based on the 1999 film starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman as a married couple who go on a night of 'sexual discovery'.

He offered more MDMA to the pair when they arrived at the door, police claim.

Hurtado told him she needed something to loosen up. The doctor then told her: 'I will get you loose once I have sex with you later.' 

At a 'Neon Kitties' party in April, police brought another undercover female officer to join as many as 100 people in the venue.

Robert Ruffin, Jaymie Lenz and Jovan Sanita Smith, attended the event that featured florescent body paint for the black lights.

Ruffin allegedly laid out four lines of cocaine on the kitchen counter, and he, Jaymie Lenz and Jovan Sanita Smith each snorted a line.

When Ruffin left, another undercover officer, Noel Roberts, scooped what was left of the substance into an evidence bag, the Review Journal reported. R

Ruffin is now facing four charges - including being under the influence and possession of a controlled substance. 

Martin met the undercover police pair again at the Book & Stage sports bar at the five-star Cosmopolitan hotel and invited them to another sex-fuelled party in September.

Hurtado told the jury: 'He said that it's basically good-looking people that have sexual intercourse with each other and that everybody is very friendly.'

Before guests could arrive, officers swarmed his house and arrested him.

During a search more than half an ounce of marijuana was found behind the DJ booth. They also discovered magic mushrooms, meth­amphetamine, cocaine and MDMA at the address. 

The doctors wife pleaded guilty earlier this month to a single charge of possession of drugs which and paid a $1,000 fine. Lenz and Jovan Sanita Smith, did the same.

In October, police executed a search warrant at the home of Shannon Grammer, also known as Shannon Gale Dutcher, who had offered police MDMA at the 'Neon Kitties' party.

They found a handgun registered to her alongside a pistol and a 12-gauge shotgun that were claimed by a friend.

Grammer told police she had been addicted to meth for 10 years. She was charged with three counts of trafficking, two counts of possession and three counts of ownership or possession of a firearm by a prohibited person as a result of a previous drug arrest.

Christopher Sbraccia, who was at the house at the same time, faces the same charges.

Martin was suspended from practicing medicine for two months after his arrest. He was told he must follow stringent guidelines for two years if he wants to continue working as a doctor. 

He went into an in-patient treatment program at the Betty Ford Center in California and was released in November, the Review Journal reported.  

In 2005 he opened ASM Ortho and describes himself as a surgeon who 'specializes in minimally invasive joint reconstruction and arthroscopic treatment of sports related injuries,' on his website. 

However he is still awaiting trial on the drug charges.  

Jennifer Coppola, another woman who attended the parties, was arrested and charged with two counts of the sale of a controlled substance.
