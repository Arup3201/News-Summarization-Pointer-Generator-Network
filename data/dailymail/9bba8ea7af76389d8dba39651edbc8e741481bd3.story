A pair of amorous tram riders in Melbourne have been caught engaging in sex acts during a commute.

The couple were reportedly spotted  engaging in the inappropriate behaviour on the number 55 service, said The Courier Mail.

The pair boarded the tram line, which runs from Colburg to Domain, at Flagstaff Hill Station, and quickly proceeded to start performing the intimate acts on each other. 

A pair of amorous tram riders in Melbourne have been caught engaging in sex acts during a commute.

Passengers on the tram have been reported as seeming uncomfortable, and while no official action has been taken, a spokesperson for Yarra Trams has said that the company was checking whether a formal complaint had been lodged.

Commuters on Melbourne public transport may not be unfamiliar with this type of incident, after reports surfaced of an amateur pornography film being taped on an inner city train.

The film was uploaded to a popular internet site, and had attracted more than 200,000 views before police took action against the couple and the production company.

In the footage, a man and a woman are clearly shown engaging in sex acts in broad daylight on a train carriage travelling along the Epping route, before making their exodus at Reservoir train station.

The couple faced fines of $563 each for behaving in an insulting or offensive manner, an indication of the penalty that could face the couple in the most recent incident.

Sergeant Kris Hamilton spoke on behalf of Victoria police, and said the pair should be ashamed of themselves, reported The Herald Sun.

'It is offensive and inappropriate and people caught will be dealt with by police by either copping a fine or being arrested,' he said.

'I use public transport daily and I’m sure I speak on behalf of other commuters when I say this is not what you want to be subjected to en-route home after a tough day in the office.'
