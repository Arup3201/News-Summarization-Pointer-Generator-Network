When it comes to this weekend’s weather forecast, there’s good news and bad news.

Temperatures are creeping up-wards – but we’re still set for a washout, with rain across most of the UK.

After sunshine today, a blanket of wet weather is set to sweep northwards tomorrow, with just a tiny part of England expected to be spared from the drizzle.

Sunshine and showers: The forecast for the next three days

Washed out: Flooding has continued across southern England this week, but there is set to be no respite in the rain. This man waded through water with his shopping in Shepperton, Surrey, on Wednesday

Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said: ‘It looks like we are going to see a band of rain pushing northwards through the early hours.

'Much of Wales, central and southern England will see the majority of these showers and they could be quite heavy.

‘In between, a thin sliver of the UK will get a fairly dry day. It looks like much of north-west England and maybe into the east – East Anglia and Lincolnshire. It’s a very, very, thin strip.’

However, the weekend will not be a total washout.

Mr Powell said: ‘In terms of the day to enjoy, it is probably Sunday – if you can dodge the showers and find the drier weather.

Watered: A greenhouse flooded by the Thames near Sunbury, Surrey, on Wednesday. Rain will continue

‘The further north east you go, the wetter and windier it will be.’

‘We have got everything under the sun over the next few days, but at least it is not going to be desperately cold.’

Temperatures are expected to remain slightly above average for mid-January, with daytime highs of 10C (50F) and night-time lows of 2C (36F).

Tomorrow night will bring the coldest weather, with patchy frost expected in the Midlands.

The mixture of sunshine and showers is expected to last into next week.  Thankfully, there is no sign of storms returning any time soon.

There is some good news however – spring is on its way.

Rain stops play: The Environment Agency has recorded a 10-year water level high on some stretches

Daffodils and snowdrops have been spotted raising their heads, trees are in bud, butterflies are on the wing.

Despite the floods, last month was two degrees warmer than average, and most areas have had only a handful of frosts.

The Woodlands Trust says that changing weather patterns says spring now arrives some 12 days earlier than 25 years ago.
