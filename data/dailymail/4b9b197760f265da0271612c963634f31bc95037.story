Aaron Ramsey's second goal against Galatasaray was so good it had one former player saying it was unlike anything he'd seen in his entire career.

As the Turkish defenders headed an Arsenal corner clear in the first half, the Welshman ran to hit the ball, with his left foot on the half-volley.

The ball flew in to the top corner from almost 30 yards out and pandemonium ensued, except, that is, among the home fans.

Aaron Ramsey celebrates after scoring his second goal of the night against Galatasaray

Yaya Sanogo looked around stunned and Wojciech Szczesny held his head in his hands. Lukas Podolski, himself the scorer of a brilliant goal earlier in the night, leant down to clean Ramsey's boot.

Former Gunner Paul Merson went one further and said: 'I've never seen anything like it in all my years. It was phenomenal.' 

Ramsey, initially at least, felt he'd scored better. Speaking to Sky Sports, he said: 'It's up there (with my best). I like the Norwich goal (better).' 

On reflection, though, Ramsey appeared to have changed his mind. He wrote on his Instagram account: 'Finished the group on a high, now can't wait for the draw. Seen my second goal back and definitely my best. Happy for my bro @poldi_official getting 2 goals and congratulations to the boys making their debuts too.'

Meanwhile, manager Arsene Wenger revealed he was unimpressed when he saw the midfielder taking aim, but was impressed with the end result. 

'When he took the shot I thought that's maybe not the best of ideas,' he told Sky Sports. 'But the way it went in was absolutely unbelievable.'

Ramsey's shot reached 53.4mph on its way to the back of the net, and took just over one second to reach its destination.
