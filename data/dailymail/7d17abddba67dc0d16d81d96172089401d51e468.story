David Cameron has hit back at the head of the European Commission, who evoked images of the First World War to attack the Tories’ plan to reclaim powers from Brussels.

Jose Manuel Barroso suggested the Prime Minister is only talking tough on the issue because he feels threatened by Ukip, who he claimed would beat the Conservatives in next year’s European elections.

Mr Barroso said his opponents risk taking Europe back to a time of ‘war and trenches’.

Despite being a supposedly neutral public servant, Mr Barroso – a former prime minister of Portugal – suggested UKIP would beat the Conservatives in next year’s European Parliament elections because ‘when it comes to being against Europe, people prefer the original to the copy’.

But Mr Cameron said the President had gone beyond his remit and must respect one of the leading parties in European Parliament.

Speaking on LBC 97.3, the Prime 
Minister said: ‘The Barroso thing did annoy me because frankly, his job 
is to serve the members of the European Union and the British 
Conservatives in the European Parliament are an important party.

‘They are the governing party of the United Kingdom and he should be respecting their views rather than trying to lecture them.

‘They’ve got an important contribution to make and I think he got it wrong, and I’ll tell him that.’

Mr Cameron, who met entrepreneurs including Jonie Worton, right, mad clear his anger at the attack on Eurosceptics

'Let me say this to all those who rejoice in Europe’s difficulties and who want to roll back our integration and go back to isolation - the pre-integrated Europe of the divisions, the war, the trenches, is not what people desire and deserve.

‘The European continent has never in its history known such a long period of peace as since the creation of the European Community. It is our duty to preserve it and deepen it.

To Tory MEP Martin Callanan:

‘Your party is looking like UKIP. UKIP may finish first in Britain.

'I have some doubts whether you are going to be elected in Britain or if it is not UKIP that will be the first force in British elections.

‘Because when it comes to be against Europe people prefer the original to the copy.

‘That is probably why they are going to vote for (Nigel) Farage. I don’t say this with any kind of satisfaction.'

He said that while he has a ‘good relationship’ with Mr Barroso he plans a ‘pretty robust exchange’ on the issue the next time he sees him.

Mr Barroso’s comments came in his annual address to the European Parliament. In a thinly veiled attack on Mr Cameron, he insisted Europe needed ‘more integration’, not less.

He said: ‘Let me say this to all those who rejoice in Europe’s difficulties and who want to roll back our integration and go back to isolation – the pre-integrated Europe of the divisions, the war, the trenches, is not what people desire and deserve.

‘The European continent has never in its 
history known such a long period of peace as since the creation of the 
European Community. It is our duty to preserve it and deepen it.’

In exchanges with Martin Callanan, the
Tory leader in the European Parliament, Mr Barroso said: ‘Your party is
looking like UKIP.

‘UKIP may finish first in Britain. I 
have some doubts whether you are going to be elected or if it is not 
UKIP that will be the first force in British elections. That is probably
why they are going to vote for [Nigel] Farage.’

Mr Callanan last night condemned the 
intervention as ‘outrageous’, adding: ‘He is effectively a civil 
servant, but he has turned it into an increasingly political role.

‘The idea that the alternative to 
greater EU integration is a return to us fighting each other in the 
trenches of the First World War is just risible.

‘David Cameron has got him rattled. He
thought he could isolate Britain, but there is growing support for the 
Prime Minister’s ideas in Germany, the Netherlands and others.’
