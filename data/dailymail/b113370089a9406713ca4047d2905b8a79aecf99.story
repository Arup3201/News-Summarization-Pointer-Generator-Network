'A lovely man': IT teacher Jonathan Taylor died after falling off a 4m-high wall after a trip to the pub on a school skiing holiday

Tributes have been paid to a teacher and 'a lovely man' who died after a fall while out walking during a school skiing trip abroad.

Jonathan Taylor, 44, fell as he walked back to his accommodation after a night out with staff colleagues at about 3.10am on Sunday.

Mr Taylor had travelled to the picturesque town of Matrei, in Austria's mountainous East Tyrol area, with about 40 pupils and staff from Christ The King Voluntary Academy Roman Catholic school, Nottingham.

His neighbours Bill and June Bailey, from Arnold, said he was 'friendly and bubbly'.

The Roman Catholic Bishop of Nottingham, the Rt Rev Malcolm McMahon, called his death 'a tragic loss', adding he would be remembered by many 'with affection'.

Mr Bailey said: 'He was a very nice man, both he and his wife.'

'He'd lived here a few years and was always helpful and handy.

'We're just very, very sorry as he was a lovely young man.'

He added Mr Taylor's wife was now staying with relatives.

Austrian Police said Mr Taylor was the last person in a group of his colleagues making their way back, but for some 'unknown reason' fell.

He went down a steep slope and then fell 13ft off a high stone wall onto the road below.

The fall left the IT teacher with 'serious head injuries' according to the police.

Emergency services attempted to resuscitate Mr Taylor but he died at the scene.

The Austrian authorities have ordered a post-mortem examination to be carried out to try to establish cause of death.

The group of 48 pupils, aged 14 to 15, 
are cutting short their week-long holiday in the Grossglockner resort 
and are expected to return to 
Nottinghamshire this evening.

Bishop McMahon said: 'I was saddened 
to learn of the death in Austria of Jonathan Taylor, an IT teacher at 
Christ the King Catholic Voluntary Academy in Arnold.

entire community of Christ the King School at this difficult time.

'Jonathan will be remembered with affection by many people.'
