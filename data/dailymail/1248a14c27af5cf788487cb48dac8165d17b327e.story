An Ivy League lawyer has been convicted of the first-degree murder his girlfriend after the violent attack was unintentionally recorded on a friend's voicemail after a pocket dial.

Jason Bohn admitted to killing his live-in girlfriend Danielle Thomas but he had hoped to be convicted of manslaughter as opposed to murder.

The Queens jury ruled against him, however, and apparently found his tales of childhood abuse were not enough to convince them to decide on manslaughter.

The New York Post reports that 35-year-old lawyer will receive his sentence on April 7.

He was also found guilty of tampering with evidence and being held in criminal contempt.

He faces a maximum penalty of life in prison without parole.

Relatives
 of Ms Thomas, a 27-year-old Weight Watchers executive, were emotional 
in the courtroom and began audibly crying before the jury entered the 
court on Wednesday afternoon.

The Columbia University-educated lawyer, whose trial got under way late January, will rely on testimony of Los Angeles-based forensic psychiatrist Alexander Sasha Bardey, who is known in Hollywood circles as a consultant on the TV drama 'Law and Order: Special Victims Unit.'

The expert attempted to convince a Queens jury that Bohn was suffering from 'Intermittent Explosive Disorder' and did not know what he was doing when he stomped on and throttled Thomas, a Kentucky native.

She went on to place some blame on Bohn's mother, MAureen O'Connell, abandoned her son when he was 10 years old to focus on her career in the publishing business.

O'Connell, who according to her corporate profile in Bloomberg BusinessWeek draws annual compensation in the amount of $1.2million, has been footing her son's mounting legal bills.

Mr Bardey co-produced Steven Soderbergh’s highly acclaimed 2013 thriller 'Side Effects' starring Rooney Mara as a young wife who kills her husband, portrayed by Channing Tatum, after taking a new anti-depression medicine.

Brutal death: Miss Thomas had moved from Florida to New York to be with her boyfriend in Queens

During opening statements January 29, prosecutors revealed that Danielle Thomas was afraid for the life of her dog, Schnoozer, and rushed home on the night of her murder to protect him, even though a friend had offered to take her to a hotel.

Prosecutor Patrick O'Connor told the jury panel that Bohn had threatened to kill the black-and-white pooch in the past, and Thomas rushed home in a bid to save her pet.

‘It was for the love of her dog,’ the prosecutor said. ‘She was afraid for her dog.’

One of the most compelling pieces of evidence was the unintentional voicemail, wherein Ms Thomas could be heard saying 'I can't breathe' as Bohn strangled her.

On the chilling recording, a man believed to be Bohn relentlessly questions why Miss Thomas made a phone call to a number with a 508 area code.

Bohn is then heard strangling the 27-year-old before letting go as she pleads with him and tries to answer his questions.

alcohol and his own abusive past for the murder; in court, the

She struggles to breath as she answers over and over: 'I don't know... Jason, I love you.'

He then replies: 'You have five seconds and then...and then I'm going to kill you.

He continues: 'I'm going to let you up and then you need to answer quickly or else you die... Danielle, why did you call that number?

'Danielle you are so stupid. You think I'm going to stop, I won't stop.'

It is unclear whether the voicemail came from the victim or alleged killer's cellphone.

Neighbors called police to check on her after hearing a fight and the woman's dead body was found in a bathtub full of ice.

Bohn had fled the couple's apartment in Queens with his girlfriend's phone, which he used to assure her family she was fine.

Missed: Bohn, right, had been violent in the 
past and Miss Thomas (pictured left with a relative) had a protection 
order against him but she worried for the safety of her dog so she returned to the apartment

He sent a text to one of her contacts 
saying: 'Please trust me,' adding that Thomas was 'fine' and attending 
the weekend’s gay pride parade in Greenwich Village.

He
 also used the phone to call a former flame, allegedly confessing to her
 that he got drunk and unwittingly slammed Miss Thomas against a wall.

An autopsy report by the medical examiner revealed that Ms Thomas died of neck compression and blunt-force trauma.

He
 was eventually tracked down to a restaurant in White Plains five days 
after the killing and charged with murder - which was later upgraded to 
first degree - and evidence tampering.

After he was jailed, Bohn dictated to his brother a self-pitying rant to be posted on Facebook blaming 
his girlfriend for the killing.

He blamed Thomas, stress, alcohol and his own abuse at the hands of his father for the murder - refusing to take responsibility for his murderous actions.

'I suspected she was a cheater,' he wrote.

'At the 
very least, I gradually confirmed she was a compulsive liar, 
particularly with regard to relations with the opposite sex, both past 
and present.

'As a result I grew insecure and 
abusive. In hines-sight [sic] one of us should've walked away. But, I was already 
madly in love with her.

'I was also extremely mad (both meanings).'

He described the night he killed her, claiming he got drunk and snapped but 'in all honesty, it was an accident,' he wrote.

'I woke up the next morning in complete shock.

'My knuckles were bruised badly and she was on the floor unconscious,' he added on his Facebook page.

Police records show that Bohn has a 
history of abuse and had repeatedly threatened Thomas before her 
death, saying he would hunt her down 'like a dog in the streets'.

When
 officers discovered Thomas, they found two handwritten notes in the 
couple’s apartment, believed to have been written by 
Bohn.

The first note 
said: ‘It was an accident…I had been drinking and I was drunk when I got
 home. She was already asleep. I woke up and there was fighting between 
us. When I woke up again she was unconscious…I am sorry.'
