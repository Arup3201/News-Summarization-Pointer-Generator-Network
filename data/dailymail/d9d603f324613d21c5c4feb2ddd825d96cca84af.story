The Olympic torch has been carried over all sorts of terrains over the last 12 days but yesterday it took to the water travelling on a barge pulled along a towpath by four costume-clad canal workers.

The famous flame, which started the day in Chester, arrived at the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct in Wales, and was carried across the longest and highest aqueduct in Britain by torchbearer Joanne Gregory, from Wrexham.

Volunteer members of the Shropshire Union Fly-boat Restoration Society dressed up in 19th century garb to pull the barge up the Llangollen Canal over the valley of the River 
Dee.

Heave-ho! Joanne Gregory carries the Olympic Torch on a hand drawn canal boat across the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, in Llangollen, Wales. The barge was pulled by four volunteer members of the Shropshire Union Fly-boat Restoration Society

The aqueduct was completed in 1805 and is a Grade I listed building and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The torch was also carried by Corporal Ricky Furgusson, 26, yesterday, a soldier who was maimed in an Afghanistan bomb blast.

The Military Cross-holder lost both his legs, his left eye and fingers from both hands when he was on patrol in Sangin in 2010.

On the flame's 12th day on the road, his comrades from 4th Battalion The Rifles lined the streets to show their support at Broseley, Shropshire.

Long way from home? Sky Sports TV presenter Kirsty Gallacher appeared in Wigan to take her turn carrying the torch

Speaking after carrying the torch on prosthetic legs, Telford-born Cpl Furgusson described the chance to carry the Olympic torch as 'a once in a lifetime opportunity'.

Asked by the BBC if his participation 
as a torchbearer was a sign of courage, he said: 'You have got two 
choices in life - sit and be lazy and do nothing and be depressed or get
up, get your legs on and live your life exactly the same way you did 
before, and that is exactly what I do.'

'I
say never say never, your life is still there and just because you are 
injured your life should not change in any way if possible.

'Still live exactly the same as you would have done before you got injured.'

'People
say I am a national hero but as far as I am concerned I did my job and 
it wasn't just me, it was me and the section who have done it overall 
together,' he added.

Comedian John Bishop took the torch to the top of the Lovell telescope's 80m focus tower in the 
pouring rain and struck a triumphant pose

Mr Bishop, seen waving with the torch, said the 
British people were great at getting behind things and the Olympics was 
now an event for the country

Meanwhile, today comedian John Bishop took the torch to the top of one of the world's largest radio telescopes.

The 45-year-old funny man carried the
flame to the top of the Lovell telescope's 80m focus tower in the 
pouring rain and struck a triumphant pose.

Located at the Jodrell Bank Observatory in Cheshire, it is the third largest fully-steerable radio telescope in the world.

Commenting on the experience of taking the torch to the top, the Liverpool-born TV star said it had been 'windy, wet and scary'.

He said: 'It is phenomenal because it is an iconic structure. We drive past it every day taking the kids to school but I never thought I would stand on it.

'The weather is terrible, but it is the north of England, that is what you are going to get.

'It is just a shame we couldn't do it
on a nicer a day but it didn't matter because, in many respects, it 
sums up what the foreigners can expect when they come over for the 
Olympics - you are going to get wet.'

Asked why the torch relay has 
captured the public imagination, he said: 'From my experience, the 
British people are great at getting behind things and the Olympics is 
now an event for the country and I think it just gives them that little 
sense of being involved.

Corporal Ricky Furgusson, 24, from Telford, said just because you are injured your life should not change in any way if possible

'And obviously, I have got behind it because I needed something to light the barbecue,' he added.

Keen sportsman Bishop has so far 
raised Â£3.4 million for the BBC charity Sport Relief after carrying out a
Week Of Hell triathlon earlier this year.

It saw him cycle 185 miles from the 
Eiffel Tower in Paris to Calais, row across the English Channel and run 
90 miles from Dover to Trafalgar Square in London, all in the space of 
five days.

Also appearing with the torch today was Kirsty Gallacher who ran with the flame in Wigan, despite having no discernible link with the area.

The 13th day of the Olympic torch 
relay began in Stoke-on-Trent, where Stoke City manager Tony Pulis was 
the first torchbearer of the day.

The torch also visited Tatton Park in
Knutsford, Cheshire, where Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne 
was photographed standing next to torchbearer Michael Dooling.

Its 107.95 miles journey through the 
North West of England today will end in Bolton, where it will be carried
by world light-welterweight champion and Olympic silver medallist Amir 
Khan.

Yesterday, 
before arriving in Broseley, Shropshire, the torch was taken to another Shropshire 
town credited as the birthplace of the Modern Games.

It was paraded in Much Wenlock before the house of Dr William Penny Brookes, the creator in 1850 of the Wenlock Olympian Games.

The
small market town's direct links to the modern Olympics date back to 
1890, when International Olympic Committee founder Baron Pierre de 
Coubertin visited Wenlock to inquire about the town's games.

De Coubertin confessed they were an important inspiration for the first Olympics of modern times, held in Athens in 1896.

In
honour of Much Wenlock's contribution to the creation of the Olympics, 
one of the two mascots at the London 2012 Games was named Wenlock.

Among
the seven torchbearers who made their way through the crowded town 
yesterday were Olympian archer Alison Williamson and 83-year-old cancer 
survivor Ronald Miles.

Local
historian Mr Miles, who is from nearby Telford, said of carrying the 
torch: 'It is the best experience I ever had in my life.

'I
have had some wonderful experiences, I saw Her Majesty the Queen 
married in 1947, I have been all over the world to 60 countries, but 
nothing touches this today.

'What was really magic were the children, someone told them my name and they all chanted 'Ron, Ron' at the top of their voices.

'I shall never have something like it even if I live to 200, will I?'

Mr
Miles said he had been training to carry the torch, and this had 
allowed him to run for half of his 300-metre stretch with the flame.

'I'm quite fit despite having a major operation to remove a bowel cancer in January this year,' he added.

Ms Williamson, who will become just 
the third British athlete to compete in six Summer Olympics when she 
takes part at London 2012, said: 'The Olympics might never have taken 
place if Baron De Coubertin had not come to Wenlock and seen the games 
that Dr William Penny Brookes had created himself.

'I
grew up in Shropshire, my archery club trained here in the winter and I
competed in the Wenlock games when I was 10, so I have a lot of 
connections with the place.'

The
40-year-old's sixth participation in the Games will put her level with 
fencer Bill Hoskyns and javelin thrower Tessa Sanderson in the number of
Olympic participations.
