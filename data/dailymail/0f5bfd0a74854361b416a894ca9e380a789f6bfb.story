Daley Blind says Manchester United are taking to Louis van Gaal's Dutch style of play.

Old Trafford's newest defender joined from Ajax  for £14million during the summer, and the Holland international revealed United have been concentrating on building up play from the back.

The 24-year-old says he has had little trouble adapting to Van Gaal's new system because it is the same implemented at Dutch club Ajax and in the Holland team.

'We are trying to build up our plays starting in defence,' Blind told The Sun. 'That is something that's not common in England.

'But at United we want to do it like that and it takes some time to develop a new style.

'I am used to it because Ajax and Holland play like that. And I am sure we will adapt to it in a good way at United, too. I think we are improving every day.'
