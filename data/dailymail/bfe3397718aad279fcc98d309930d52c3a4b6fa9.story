Pick Jack Wilshere and Co for a dash at European U21 glory next summer 

Arsene Wenger seems to be against young Arsenal players Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Calum Chambers joining up with the England Under 21s next summer.

All would be eligible to play at the European Championship in the Czech Republic, and many have suggested that the senior side's younger players should drop down and get tournament experience under Gareth Southgate.

But Wenger believes full internationals shouldn't consider it, partly because they 'won't play with the same quality.'

The Arsenal boss believes a player is 'never good' when he drops down from his senior international side

Calum Chambers will be another Gunner who would be eligible for the European Championship in 2015

‘Once a guy has moved up to the full national team, you put him down and he is never good,’ Wenger said. 

‘On the selfish front for us, when a guy has played 50 games, it is better he has a good rest during the summer. But, most of the time, when they move down, they are not completely at their quality.’

Wenger's comments seem to contradict those of Oxlade-Chamberlain's, who said he would be delighted to play for the Under 21s in 2015.

'Yes (I’d play at the Euros if I was asked), you’d never turn your nose up at something like that,’ said the 21-year-old, who has 18 England caps.

‘But there’s a lot that goes into that because the national team have two games around the same time as the tournament. So it’s up to Roy Hodgson to decide what he wants.

‘There’s a lot of players in the England squad at the moment that could drop back down and play for the Under 21s so it’s up to the manager to decide.

‘When that time comes around I’ll have to think about it. Gareth (Southgate, England U21 manager) might not even want me. It’s a discussion that will be had closer to the time with the England manager, someone at Arsenal and Gareth Southgate.’ 

The line-up in red is the one that beat Croatia in the play-off, but the blue team is what England could field
