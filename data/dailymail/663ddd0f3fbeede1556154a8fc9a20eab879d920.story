The Sky is the limit for Matthew Macklin and Irish boxing, according to promoter Eddie Hearn - all thanks to the ex-European champion’s vast potential.

Macklin’s WBC world middleweight title eliminator against Argentina’s Jorge Sebastian Heiland was on Tuesday confirmed for Dublin’s 3 Arena on November 15, having been rescheduled from its original date last August.

The Sky TV bill has an extra-polished sheen to it, too, as Hearn has added Irish Olympic medallist John Joe Nevin to the card, while the promoter hopes former European amateur champion Jason Quigley will also feature in his first home pro bout.

The August show had been postponed due to the shooting of Macklin’s trainer Jamie Moore in Marbella (now recovering from his injuries), and, despite having sold-out Dublin’s 2,000-capacity National Stadium in a matter of minutes, Macklin’s career was in danger of going off the rails and losing a much-needed momentum boost.

But while domestic battles between rivals Gary ‘Spike’ O’Sullivan and Anthony Fitzgerald, and Ian Tims and Michael Sweeney, on the new undercard have Irish fight fans salivating, only Macklin had the pulling power to lure Sky TV back into the mix, according to Hearn, who has re-fixed the show for the 3 Arena, which will have a 6,000 capacity as his Matchroom promotional outfit dip their toe into the Irish market.

‘He’s the reason why we’re here,’ said Hearn of three-time world-title challenger Macklin. ‘No disrespect to Fitz, Spike and those guys, we couldn’t run a Sky date with those guys alone on the bill. They’re a brilliant support cast, they make the show, but you need the headline act, so if he loses, a lot hinges for Irish boxing on his performance and result.’

The eagerness to please the broadcaster is down to the fact that TV networks remain the main paymasters behind big fight nights.

Macklin, Birmingham-born with strong Tipperary roots, turned down Sky’s suggestion to stage the fight in the city of his birth, favouring a return to the Irish capital.

‘I’m proud to be bringing it back here, but, also, you feel that it’s not just my career riding on it. If I can go on and do well and bring more big nights back here, other [Irish] lads can benefit from it,’ he said. ‘It’s a good weight on my shoulders, not a heavy one.’

Having struggled to shake off his ring rust in a keep-busy win over Spaniard Jose Yebes last month, Macklin is also keen to prove he still belongs at world level against 27-year-old Heiland.

‘This is the acid test. If I beat this guy and look really good doing it, I know that’s me on the way to becoming world champion,’ said Macklin.

‘If I perform like I know I can, I probably will knock him out.’
