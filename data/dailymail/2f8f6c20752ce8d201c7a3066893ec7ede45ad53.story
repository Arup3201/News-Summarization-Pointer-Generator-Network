A Tory MP told a one-legged man in a wheelchair begging outside Parliament to ‘get a job’.

Ministerial aide Daniel Kawczynski, who is 6ft 8in, towered over the 47-year-old disabled drug addict, admonishing him for begging and  urging him to find work through a Government scheme.

The MP was heard telling Mark McGuigan: ‘Get a job, find some work. Yes, I know it is hard, I have struggled too.’

Last night Mr McGuigan said the MP for Shrewsbury and Atcham made him feel small and humiliated and he wanted to ‘name and shame’ Mr Kawczynski.

But the MP, a champion of welfare reform, told the Daily Mail he simply wanted to help the beggar back into  work, adding: ‘There are better and more productive ways for helping people to spend their time.’

The incident happened outside Westminster Tube station on October 7 at around 8pm and was witnessed by the Mail. After the MP walked off, a passer-by dropped some money into the man’s hat, saying: ‘Well done mate, for standing up to that t*****.’

Mr McGuigan, who lives in Bermondsey, South London, said: ‘He told me to stop begging and to get a job. He made me feel really small. He was so sanctimonious.

‘I can’t get a job. I can barely read and write. Look at me, I am missing a leg.

‘I said that to him but he just started getting more and more aggressive. It  was horrible.

‘I felt very intimidated by the way he was leaning over me saying, “Get a job, get a job”. He was towering over me.’

Mr McGuigan was begging outside Parliament. He began drinking heavily and taking drugs at the age of 17, which culminated in him losing his right leg a decade ago

The father of one, who grew up in  Peckham, South London, added: ‘I wasn’t born with a silver spoon in my mouth like most MPs.

‘My parents were alcoholics, my brothers were burglars, my sisters were on the drink at an early age. My mother had  six kids to look after, and I was the  youngest. We didn’t have a bath, we had an outside toilet.’

Mr McGuigan added: ‘I was placed into care at the age of ten but it was almost the best thing that happened to me because suddenly there was food everywhere.’

He did not receive a proper education because he was in and out of care homes and quickly found himself embroiled in a life of drugs and crime.

He began drinking heavily and taking drugs at the age of 17, which culminated in him losing his right leg a decade ago – it had to be amputated after he contracted septicaemia from injecting heroin.

Mr Kawczynski, who is officially classified as a giant, said he did ‘not recall’ using the precise words put to him, but that he did think a man asking him for money should be challenged on why he was not looking for work.

He said: ‘He asked me for money so I asked him what he was doing to find a job. He said, “I can’t get a job”.

‘He had difficulties in literacy and numeracy. I told him there were Government initiatives to help him with this. I said to him, “If you let me know where you live I can help”.’

Mr Kawczynski, who has hailed the Government for bringing 123,000 more disabled people into work, said he did not approve of begging, adding: ‘The State and individuals have a responsibility to help people to try to get work.’

The MP, an aide to Welsh Secretary David Jones, boosts his £66,000 salary with consultancy work for Middle East and mining firms and can charge £3,000 for eight hours’ work for the mining  company Tigris Financial. Another firm paid for him to travel to Mauritania for a mining conference.

Mr Kawczynski, who was born in Warsaw but moved to Britain with his mother as a child, charged taxpayers for all 72 first-class rail journeys between his Shropshire constituency and London since March 2011. In 2009, he was criticised for advertising for an unpaid intern.

In July he announced that he was bisexual and in a relationship with a man, two years after divorcing his wife Kate.
