President Barack Obama started his presidency by removing a  bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office, sending the Queen of England an iPod filled with his own speeches and gifting a boxed set of 25 DVDs to then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown – which he reportedly couldn't play in the UK.

There were no apologies for the Borat-like gaffes, leading pundits to predict that America's new chief executive would insist being president means never having to say you're sorry.

Not so much.

WORLD RECORD IN THE 40-METER  BACKTRACK: Obama apologized after comparing his performance on a bowling alley to the Special Olympics

I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU BUMPED: Obama's golf game displaced a military couple's wedding last month in Hawaii, bring another apology

REMEMBER THIS? Obama apologized in July 24 after he said Cambridge, Massachusetts police had 'acted stupidly' by arresting a black Harvard professor in front of his home

A list published by The Washington Post includes 13 Obama apologies, not including what his conservative adversaries consider an overall apologetic tone about America's position of dominance in the world. 

The list also omits the tepid mea culpa the White House offered Monday for sending no one of importance to a massive anti-terror rally held Sunday in Paris.

'I think it's fair to say that we should have sent someone with a higher profile' than the U.S. ambassador to France, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest conceded Monday.

The words 'sorry' and 'apologize' didn't make cameos, but they have in the past, beginning just a few months into Obama's presidency.

After comparing his awkward style of bowling to handicapped athletes who compete in the Special Olympics in March 2009, Obama called Special Olympics Chairman Tim Shriver to apologize personally.

He made the comment on 'The Tonight Show,' and offered his mea culpa in the evening before the show even aired.  

Obama had told host Jay Leno that he was embarrassed after he scored just 129 on the White House's private bowling alley.

'It's like – it was like Special Olympics or something,' he said.

Then-Press Secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters the next day that Obama understood special olympians 'deserve a lot better than – than the thoughtless joke that he made last night, and he apologizes for that.'

A more recent Obama slight brought a different kind of apology after his golf game in Hawaii forced an engaged military couple to move their wedding at the last minute. 

The bride's sister said it was 'emotional, especially for her – she’s the bride and in less than 24 hours they had to change everything they had planned.'

Ultimately, she said, Obama called personally for a 'wonderful talk' and 'apologized and congratulated them.'

On the world stage, the president has apologized to at least two heads of state.

Following an incident in 2012 where American NATO troops were caught burning Qu'rans in Afghanistan, Obama apologized to that country's then-president, Hamid Karzai.

The apology rankled some in the U.S. since violent protests after the holy-book burnings resulted in the deaths of two American soldiers.

The Qu'rans had been confiscated from Muslim prisoners on a U.S. military base because it was feared they were using the books to pass information to each other. The soldiers failed to follow Army regulations covering the proper disposal of religious books.

And in October 2013 German Chancellor Angela Merkel got a personal apology from Obama after it emerged that the National Security Agency had tapped her cell phone, beginning in 2002.

He offered his hat-in-hand confession when Merkel called him – most likely on a land line – to discuss the unusual breach of trust.

His fellow Democrats have had a few presidential admissions of guilt.

California Attorney General Kamala Harris, now on the short list of likely Democratic contenders for the Senate seat soon to be vacated by Barbara Boxer, had hers in November 2013.

Obama found himself behind the feminist 8-ball when he complimented Harris on her beauty.

'She is brilliant and she is dedicated and she is tough, and she is exactly what you'd want in anybody who is administering the law, and making sure that everybody is getting a fair shake,' the president said during a Democratic fundraiser in San Francisco.

'She also happens to be, by far, the best looking attorney general in the country. It's true! C'mon!'

Jay Carney, then the White House Press Secretary, told reporters the next day that Obama 'did speak with Attorney General Harris last night, after he came back from his trip, and he called her to apologize for the distraction created by his comments.' 

Two apologies have come from the president following the initial debacles related to his Affordable Care Act. 

After Obama made at least 37 public promises that Americans who liked their medical insurance would be able to keep it under Obamacare, the opposite turned out to be true. 

Millions of Americans found themselves with canceled insurance policies.

In November 2013, Obama apologized – but gave no quarter in insisting that the policy move forward as planned.

'I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me,' he said during a television interview.

His more heartfelt apology, though, was to Democrats who found his deception politically damaging.

'I feel deeply responsible,' he said during a White House press conference, 'for making it harder for them rather than easier for them to continue to promote the core values that I think led them to support this thing in the first place.'
