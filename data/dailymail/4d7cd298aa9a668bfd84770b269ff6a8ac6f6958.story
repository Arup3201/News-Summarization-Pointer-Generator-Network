Nancy Kerrigan has opened up for the 
first time about the figure skating scandal that shook the Olympic world
 20 years ago, and said she was shocked to think Tonya Harding could be behind it because the pair 'were friendly.'

In 
1994, Kerrigan was clubbed in the knee at the US Figure Skating 
Championships by Harding's ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and a hit squad to 
try to keep her from skating against her rival in the Lillehammer 
Olympics.

Kerrigan, who recovered and went on to win a silver medal at the games, said she really wanted to believe Harding wasn't involved in the bizarre plot that made worldwide headlines.

'I truly wanted to believe that she had nothing to do with it at all,' the 44-year-old said on Morning Joe Monday.

'Because how could that seem possible that someone you know, I mean we were competitors, but... we were friendly. So to think that anyone you know would deliberately try to hurt you, yeah, it's too bizarre to understand.'

First interviews: Nancy Kerrigan, pictured Monday, has opened up for the first time about the figure skating scandal that shook the Olympic world 20 years ago

She described a new documentary 'Nancy & Tonya,' which will air on NBC on Sunday, as being 'surreal' to watch.

Voice
 quivering and hands fidgeting, Kerrigan first watched the one-hour retrospective at a press screening in Sochi.

Many entertained 
the idea that Harding was linked to the clumsy attack. And even after Gillooly and two associates were arrested, Kerrigan gave Harding the benefit of the doubt.

'I can remember saying even to the FBI, "Well, maybe Tonya really didn't know. Maybe they did it for her."' she recalls. 'And they're like, "Nancy, we can't prove it, but we think she was the mastermind of the whole thing."'

At that point, she said she felt 'disappointment, sadness.' And while Harding still denies having any role, Kerrigan said she doesn't believe her.

'Why would the people around her want to hurt me?' she said on Morning Joe. 'What did they have to gain? I guess she's the only one who really had anything to gain. And I was told "I know we can't prove it but we're telling you. She did." I hated hearing it. It stinks. It's sad on so many levels.'

When asked if she has forgiven Harding for what happened, she said she doesn't think about it, being a busy mom-of-three. But forgiven, she hasn't.

'I don't know. I don't think about it really. When I read transcripts from the FBI, they planned to kill me at one point. That was one of the options. To kill me over a sporting event. That's crazy,' she said.

'There were all these other brutal options that they were thinking about doing to me. I've moved on i don't think about it as forgiveness. I just hope she's happy... and can be able to move on.

At the press screening of the 
documentary in Sochi Friday, it was clear that watching the events 
unfold again all these years later brought bubbling back to the surface 
those same feelings of helplessness and bewilderment.

'It
 made me think about everything all over again,' Kerrigan said after the
 screening of 'Nancy & Tonya.'

'It's
 surprising how this whole event and being attacked, it's changed not 
just skating, it changed my life. It changed tabloid journalism, reality
 television. That whole other aspect that I had no part of. It just 
moved the world, almost, in a different direction. Whether it's for the 
better or not, who knows? It just changed everything.'

It touched off a staggering scandal that pushed figure skating into the mainstream and made the camera-shy Kerrigan the uncomfortable subject of international fascination.

Kerrigan recovered in time to win a silver medal in Lillehammer, while Harding spun out of control.

'It's a little surreal to watch your life and to think, "That's me,"' Kerrigan, who works for NBC as a skating analyst for the Sochi Games, said after watching the show.

'It's almost like a whole other person at this point. I've changed. Well, I haven't changed really much, just moved on. Things in my life are different. I'm basically the same sort of competitive person, but it's just things move on.'

Over it: 'I've apologized so many times,' Harding, pictured here in 1994, said dismissively in the documentary. 'She is not worth my time anymore.' He ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, right, was arrested after the attack

As Harding parlayed the incident into
 a circus sideshow sort of celebrity that included televised boxing 
matches and guest commentary spots on hockey TV shows, Kerrigan, a 
married mom of three, retreated to the cocoon of family life.

She almost never spoke publicly about her experience until just recently as the 20th anniversary approached.

During
 the screening, a dozen or so people sat near the front of the room. But
 Kerrigan sat near the back, out of sight while she watched the show 
recap her rise from modest means to skating stardom; the 'whack heard 
'round the world' that jeopardized her Olympic chances; and Harding talk
 about a hard-scrabble upbringing while continuing to deny she had any 
role in the attack on Kerrigan.

'I've apologized so many times,' Harding said dismissively in the show. 'She is not worth my time anymore.'

'When you see someone struggle from the beginning, that's hard and I feel for her,' Kerrigan said. 'It doesn't excuse poor judgment. I hope now, after all this, for not just my sake but her sake, too. She has a family. Let's move on. You've got to allow people that chance to get on with their lives and try to be better and learn from mistakes.'

As much as she expressed a desire to move past it Friday, there were times when it was clear that there is still some lingering pain and resentment for Kerrigan.

When journalist Mary Carillo, who interviewed both Kerrigan and Harding for the piece, was asked about Harding's persistent denial of involvement in the assault, Kerrigan interjected with an exasperated chuckle.

'Wouldn't it be weird to change it now?' Kerrigan said.

One of the toughest parts for Kerrigan was to see how some portrayed her as 'an ice princess,' a robotic, occasionally snarky competitor who was mocked for her cries of 'Why? Why?' when she was struck on the knee and when microphones caught her calling a parade at Walt Disney World 'corny.'

'I remember how that felt,' Kerrigan said. 'So watching it, it's upsetting. Why are people like that? I don't understand.'

She said she's always been a private person, so when the world turned its camera lens on her in 1994, the harsh light that shined with it was difficult for her to handle. She felt the picture that was painted was unfair and unflattering, a feeling that hasn't faded over time.

'I always wanted to be understood. Who doesn't want to be liked, right?' Kerrigan said, her voice trailing off as she concluded the interview. 'That's all. I'm sorry.'
