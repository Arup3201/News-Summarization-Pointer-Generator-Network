Justin Bieber's new Calvin Klein underwear ads were a running joke on this week's episode of Saturday Night Live.

The Canadian singer was played by Kate McKinon in the parody ads, with Cecily Strong taking on the role of model Lara Stone.

The spots saw Bieber dribbling a basketball, riding a scooter and making outlandish statements such as; 'My peepee's in there' and 'My Calvin's, clothes for my big wiener.'

Playing Bieber, McKinon wore nothing but a pair of white boxer briefs, a white tank and high top sneakers.

At one point she flexed and, staring into the camera, asked; 'Are my muscles cute?'

Bieber was also seen crying and kicking a scooter at one point before announcing; 'Yo, all this underwear's making me tired.'

The commercial then cut to him playing airplane on Strong's feet.

One ad ended with Bieber saying 'My peepee's in there'

In another ad Bieber stares at the camera and says, 'My Calvin's, clothes for my big wiener'

There were also a variety of juvenile antics, like the singer trying to grab Strong's boob repeatedly

There were also a variety of juvenile antics, like the singer trying to grab Strong's boob repeatedly, thrusting his pelvis at the camera and sneaking up behind Strong to scare her.

Bieber, who recently announced he was back in the studio recording, has yet to respond to the parody commercials, though some of his fans have made their opinions known.

And surprisingly, they don't seem mad at the sketch at all, with many instead praising McKinon's portrayal of Bieber.
