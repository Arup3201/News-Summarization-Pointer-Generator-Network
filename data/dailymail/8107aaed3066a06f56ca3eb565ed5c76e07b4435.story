The mother who was pictured crying in a mugshot after she left her children in her car to attend a job interview has spoken of her joy at being reunited with them.

Shanesha Taylor, 35, from Phoenix, Arizona, was barred from seeing them after she was arrested in March for leaving her two sons - aged six months and two years - alone in her car for 45 minutes while she went for an interview.

But after regaining custody two weeks ago, the single mother-of-three and Air Force veteran says she is now making up for lost time and said in an interview: 'It's great - a whole lot of family time going on, a lot of activities.'

After regaining custody two weeks ago, the single mother-of-three and Air Force veteran says she is now making up for lost time and said in an interview: 'It's great - a whole lot of family time going on, a lot of activities'

'Even though we used to watch TV in different rooms, now we're sitting together on the couch,' said Taylor to ABC News today.

 'The time we missed apart, we're definitely making up for that now.'

But she admits the process has not been easy and her 10-year-old daughter has been teased at school forcing teachers to block her Taylor's name on internet searches at the facility.

'She was being picked on, had students telling her they saw her mom on TV, saying, why is your mom in jail?' Taylor said.

'Students asking her, put your mom's name in the computer, let's see what comes up. It was rough.' 

On March 20 a witness found the baby crying hysterically and sweating profusely as temperatures inside the SUV topped 100 degrees.

According to court documents, firefighters found the vehicle's windows rolled down an inch and no running air conditioning to keep the children cool. 

The story made national headlines after Taylor's emotional mug shot emerged, and she revealed that she had acted out of desperation after the babysitter pulled out at the last minute.

'It was me knowing my family was in crisis and knowing that I had to make a choice between providing for my children or caring for my children,' she told Matt Lauer on the Today show earlier this summer. 

As strangers donated more than $114,000 to pay her legal fees and other expenses, the story sparked a national debate about how much access single mothers or those in dire financial situations have to public assistance.

Her children were taken to hospital on the day of her arrest but were not found to have suffered any injuries. 

They were placed with family and Taylor was eventually allowed to see them under supervision.

Taylor was released from jail on March 31. 

She was granted custody of her three children at a hearing in a Maricopa County courtroom earlier this month.

The court previously agreed to dismiss the abuse charges against her as long as she completes parenting classes. 

Taylor said she is still looking for a job and hopes to land one in the service industry.

'I am still looking. It's been a little bit difficult. My impression is that others are a little reluctant to take that chance on me simply because of the media surrounding my case,' she said.
