Figures released by British Transport Police show half of all convictions for pickpocketing on the London Underground are handed out to Romanians.

Information revealed through a Freedom of Information request shows out of the 5,280 reported pickpocketing incidents on the London Underground between November 1, 2012 and October 31, 2013, there were just 170 convictions.

Of those convictions, 52 per cent were Romanian.

Britons were also guilty of stealing from fellow passengers as were Jamaicans, Slovakians, Algerians, Latvians, Somalians, Bulgarians and Mexicans.

As The Express revealed today, the files are a snapshot of the true picture as many pickpocketing incidents go unreported. 

Phil Hufton, chief operating officer at London Underground, said: 'The risk of becoming a victim of crime while travelling on our public transport system is at its lowest level ever. There are over four million passenger journeys on our London Underground services each day, with just 9.6 crimes for every million journeys.

'Pickpocketing is the most common type of crime experienced on the transport system and is tackled proactively by our partners at British Transport Police through Operation Magnum. As part of this operation, plain-clothes pickpocket squad officers, highly trained in identifying pickpocket behaviour, are out on the Tube network every day spotting offenders, arresting them and bringing them before the courts.

'We also have a network wide marketing campaign that is specifically aimed at advising passengers on how best to protect themselves from thieves. We are confident this continued partnership approach will have a long term impact and further reduce this type of crime.'

The Home Office told the newspaper: 'Anyone coming to the UK must abide by our laws. EU citizens who commit crimes or abuse these rights are liable to be removed.'

'The most common crime': Britons were also guilty of stealing from fellow tube passengers

In October, MailOnline revealed that some Romanian gangs were using cheap flights to come to Britain to commit crimes.

Up to 240 crime networks have been identified in the country by Europol, the European criminal intelligence agency.

Its director Rob Wainwright said crooks are using low-cost airlines to target cities for one-day sprees.

Thieves, credit card fraudsters and pickpockets buy cheap tickets to fly in and out in just a few hours.

As a result police are almost powerless to identify those responsible.

An estimated 68,000 Romanians live in Britain, but there have been 28,000 arrests of Romanian people for serious offences in the past five years.

Mr Wainwright said his agency was facing ‘petty criminals operating across multiple jurisdictions’.

He added Romanian and Bulgarian offenders are responsible for 90 per cent of all card-skimming in Europe.

Government figures suggest the number of Romanians and Bulgarians in the UK has gone up by a third in the past year. The number working in the UK rose from 91,000 in April to June 2012 to 127,000 during the same period this year.

Both countries joined the EU in 2007, and from January 1 their citizens will have full rights to live and work here.

France’s foreign minister has called for Romanians and  Bulgarians to be stopped from travelling freely. Laurent Fabius said there were security fears over crooks using the two impoverished countries as a way into the rest of the EU.
