A revealing video offers a chilling picture of what happens when a frightened boy runs up to strangers on US streets and tells them that a man is trying to kidnap him.

Hidden cameras film the reactions of various adults when the boy, played by a child actor named Nathan, tells strangers he had been in the park with his mother when a ‘man in a jacket’ came up to him and tried to put him in his car.

‘He won’t stop chasing me,’ he told one couple.

Social experiment: Yousef Saleh Erakat (right) pretended to abduct an actor to see how adults would respond if a stranger kidnapped a child in front of them. This man (left), whom the boy approached for help, continued eating his ice cream and did not intervene

The man in the jacket, played by the creator of The Kidnapping Children Experiment, Yousef Saleh Erakat, then comes over, claiming to be the boy’s father and tells the strangers that the boy has run off and is telling lies.

Several adults step in to defend the boy. One man pushes the ‘abductor’ against a car and gives the boy his phone, telling him to dial his mum’s number.

One brave woman physically shields the boy when the man comes up and tries to convince her that Nathan is his son.

When the ‘abductor’ gets aggressive she sprays him with pepper spray before telling the boy to run. The cameraman chases the woman down and tells her that she is safe and she actually sprayed an actor.

The boy, Nathan, would approach strangers and tell them that 'a man in a jacket' took him from his mother and tried to put him in a car

Chilling footage: Sometimes the strangers would believe the 'abductor' and walk off without helping the boy. Like this man who shook the abductor's hand and laughed about the boy telling lies

Even though it is staged, the footage is chilling. Some of the people Nathan approaches on various US streets let him let him walk off with the man. One man even shakes hands with the ‘abductor’ and laughs at the boy’s high-jinks.

The Kidnapping Children Experiment was created to raise awareness about the role the public can play in stopping child kidnappings.

‘One decision can change an individuals [sic] life forever. When you are put to the test, will you pass?’ asks the video, which was uploaded to YouTube yesterday.

The video’s creator, Yousef Erakat, is a 24-year-old entertainer from California. His YouTube channel FouseyTube is incredibly popular and produced parodies, comedy sketches, and thought-provoking videos including The Bullying Experiment, which went viral last year.

Erakat wrote on his YouTube page that he wanted to make the videos because: ‘Growing up my biggest fear was getting kidnapped... This video was a way for me to express that fear in an artistic [sic] way and also spread positive change as to why it is important to ACT when put into these types of situations.’

'He won't stop chasing me': Nathan approached this couple while they were jogging and told them he was being followed by an 'abductor'

Heroic: The couple shielded the boy and when his 'abductor' became aggressive, the woman sprayed him with pepper spray and told the boy to run away

'You're not his father': Erakat (right) told members of the public that he was the boy's father and that the boy had just run away from him as a joke. Some people, such as the man pictured (centre) did not believe him and physically prevented him from getting to the child

'He just told me somebody took him': The video, which was released on YouTube, showed the reactions of adults to a young boy who claims someone is trying to abduct him

Passing the test: This man (centre) stopped the 'abductor' from getting close to the boy and gave him his phone so he could call his mother
