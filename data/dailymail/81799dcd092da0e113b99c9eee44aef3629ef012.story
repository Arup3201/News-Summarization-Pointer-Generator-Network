A man, who was arrested after allegedly attempting to steal a woman's purse while dressed as Spiderman, told police his costume was part of a cunning 'disguise'.

Daniel James Bradley, 22, was spotted in the red and blue superhero outfit on Saturday afternoon following a botched street robbery in Merced, California.Â 

According to police, the victim, a 24-year-old woman, said she had just parked her car when the suspect began staring at her and then walked towards her near the corner of V and 15th street.

Bradely, who was wearing a brown and green jacket over his Spiderman suit, allegedly said: 'give me your purse'.

The victim said she thought she saw him holding a gun underneath his sleeve and ran off, screaming for someone to call police.

At this point Bradley is believed to have panicked and fled the scene.

He dumped the jacket and metal bar he was carrying behind a bush, and was later spotted racing down the sidewalk in the Spiderman suit.

Police spokesman Lt. Bimley West said a witness saw the attempted robbery happen, and identified Bradley as the suspect. He was also identified by the victim.

After posing for a mugshot, Bradley's bail was set at $65,000 and he was subsequently thrown into county jail.

When police questioned Bradley about why he was wearing the Spiderman outfit, he replied it was part of his 'disguise'.
