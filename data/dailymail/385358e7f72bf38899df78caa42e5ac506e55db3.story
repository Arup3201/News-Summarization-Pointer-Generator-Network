Dangling from a wooden frame, a live but unconscious pig is shot by a soldier to inflict terrible wounds.

The stricken animal, still breathing, is then untied so military medics can operate on it and learn how to treat traumatic battlefield injuries.

The shocking photos – never seen before – were taken in Denmark during a series of experiments which are attended by surgeons serving in Britain’s Armed Forces.

Military surgeons who serve in the British Forces are taking part in controversial medical training in which live pigs are shot and wounded by marksmen so that medics can practise battlefield surgery. The animals are first strung up

The medical professionals are sent to Denmark to operate on the live animal - which has been strung up and shot by trained marksmen - while it is still breathing

The animals are taken by stretcher into operating theatres where the surgeons treat their wounds in a simulation of how injured soldiers are cared for

The Ministry of Defence has admitted 
that live pigs are also blown up by explosives at the Definitive 
Surgical and Trauma Care course held at Nato’s Jaegerspris Kaserne 
training area, 30 miles from Copenhagen.

Military
 chiefs have defended the exercises, saying they had ‘saved many lives’ 
in Afghanistan and Iraq. The courses have led to huge improvements in 
the treatment of soldiers injured by bullets and roadside bombs.

But animal welfare activists have demanded an end to the ‘brutal’ practice.

Pigs are then treated the same as a human casualty would be -  with medics rushing to their side and using dressings to stem blood loss

They are then taken to the waiting teams of surgeons. It is believed that even if the operation is a success, the animals are later destroyed

The
 photographs of pigs being shot with an AK-47 assault rifle or a 9mm 
handgun were obtained by campaign group People for the Ethical Treatment
 of Animals UK (PETA UK).

They
 were published as Denmark was at the centre of another animal cruelty 
row, after the controversial killing of a healthy giraffe at Copenhagen 
Zoo.

Mimi Bekhechi, PETA UK
 associate director, said it was ‘shameful’ the British military were 
taking part in the twice-yearly training courses that are nicknamed 
Operation Danish Bacon.She said: ‘The exercises are impossible to 
justify medically, ethically or educationally.’

Campaigners
 claim that hi-tech human simulators – such as the state-of-the-art 
Caesar simulator, which ‘breathes and bleeds’ – should be used instead 
of animals.

During the 
Danish experiments, sedatives are first mixed into the pigs’ food. When 
they fall asleep they are anaesthetised by a vet.

The Definitive Surgical and Trauma Care course (DSTC) took place at Nato's Jaegerspris training area 30 miles north-west of the Danish capital Copenhagen

Pigs are used in the exercise so surgeons can learn how to treat battle wounds, because they are genetically very close to humans

Camp Bastion hospital, in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. The MoD has 
defended sending medical staff for the  animal training, 
saying simulators are used where possible to train for real-life situations as above.

The
 animals – from a breed which has similar skin to humans – are then 
taken to a shooting range, where marksmen try to ensure that their shots
 injure but do not kill.

The
 pigs are then placed on a stretcher – just as a human casualty would be
 – while medics use dressings to stem blood loss before a waiting team 
of surgeons operates. Even if the operation is a success, the animals 
are later destroyed.

The 
use of animals in military experiments in the UK is not illegal, but to 
carry out similar training approval would need to be obtained from the 
Home Office on a case-by-case basis.

An
 MoD spokesman said: ‘The research we undertake saves lives by helping 
us develop world-class protective equipment and new medical treatments 
that benefit both troops and civilians.

‘Advances
 in technology mean we are reducing the number of procedures carried out
 on pigs but there is some research, such as countering the threat posed
 by chemical and biological weapons, that can not be conducted without 
the use of animals.’
