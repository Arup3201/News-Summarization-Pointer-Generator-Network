Campaign: British aid money to Pakistan is allegedly used to fund party of President Asif Ali Zardari

Britain's decision to make Pakistan its biggest recipient of foreign aid is under scrutiny amid claims that £300million is helping to bankroll Benazir Bhutto’s former party.

In evidence to a Commons inquiry, an aid expert alleged the Benazir Income Support Programme was being used to buy support for Mrs Bhutto’s widower, President Asif Ali Zardari, and his party.

Ehtisham Ahmad, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics, said the Department for International Development was pouring money into a scheme used to buy votes.

‘This is is the mechanism – which is 
funded partly by DFID – to make friends and influence people. This is 
the re-election campaign of Mr Zardari, which is funded by DFID,’ he 
said.

The Select Committee on International Development is due to publish a report into aid to Pakistan on Thursday.

The
UK’s development assistance is expected to more than double between 
2011 and 2015, meaning Pakistan will become the UK’s biggest aid 
recipient –getting almost £450million per year by 2015.

Some
60million people in Pakistan, one in three, live in poverty and 
regularly go hungry. Pakistan has 12million out-of-school children and 
half of all adults, including two of every three women, cannot read and 
write.

However, Pakistan’s 
status as the potential largest recipient of UK aid is controversial, 
given its unstable political situation, large defence budget, activities
of the military and intelligence services, level of corruption and tax 
avoidance, and position as a middle-income country.

Britain has said the increase in aid 
is conditional on the government of Pakistan’s own progress in widening 
the country’s tax base and tackling corruption.

But
the Independent Commission for Aid Impact warned recently in a report 
that plans for a vast hike in aid should be ‘approached cautiously’.

‘We
note that DFID has no track record of delivering programmes in Pakistan
on the scale that is now contemplated,’ the report warned.

Half of the £300million going to the 
controversial scheme in Pakistan will be given to families to help lift 
them out of poverty, while the rest will be used to encourage parents to
send children to school.

Accusations: Aid expert Ehtisham Ahmad alleged the Benazir Income Support Programme was being used to buy support for the party of President Asif Ali Zardari, who is the widower of Benazir Bhutto

But opposition parties complain the name of the programme means many people believe the money comes from the Bhutto family rather than the government.

‘The fact it is called Benazir Income Support Programme tends to suggest there is what is called clientelism,’ said Dr Ahmad. ‘The more you give the more benefit there is to the party that bears the Bhutto name.’

Imran Khan, the cricketer turned politician, claimed the programme was nothing more than a scam to ‘buy votes’.

The biggest opposition party, the PML-N, has said it would reform the scheme and rename it the National Support Programme to avoid the charge of using it for political benefit.

A DFID spokesman said: ‘The UK is politically impartial in Pakistan. Our aid is based on need and effectiveness, not politics. The Benazir Income Support Programme Act was unanimously passed and supported by all political parties in Pakistan.

'We keep our programme in Pakistan under constant review, and will continue to do so after the elections.

'Economic reform in Pakistan, including on tax, will be critical post-election, whoever wins. It will be important for elected politicians to show leadership to the Pakistan electorate and a commitment to reform by submitting tax returns and paying tax due.'
