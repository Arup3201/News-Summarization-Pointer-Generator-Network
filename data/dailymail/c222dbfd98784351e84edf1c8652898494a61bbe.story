Residents in one of the most deprived areas in Britain can now buy a full English breakfast for just one pound after a chain of bakers opened a budget cafe.

Poundcafe in Kirkby, Merseyside, has proved to be an instant success after 300 customers descended on the eatery on its first day of trading to take advantage of the £1 four-item breakfast menu with a choice of egg, bacon, sausage, hash brown, baked beans or tomatoes.

The budget cafe opening comes left than a month after a council announced it was selling 35 houses in one of its most rundown areas of Stoke-on-Trent for just £1 each to help rejuvenate the area.

It is hoped Poundcafe will have a similar impact on Kirkby, which has one of the highest unemployment figures in the UK, by boosting trade in the area and community relations.

Poundcafe: A new budget cafe in deprived Kirkby, Merseyside, which has one of the highest unemployment figures in the country, is offering customers a full English breakfast for just £1

The Poundcafe is the first of its kind 
in the country and is the latest outlet for the hugely successful 
Poundbakery, which has opened 60 stores in the north west in two years.

The standard four-item breakfast menu costs a £1 but each additional item is just 25p each while drinks and desserts, including cakes and gingerbread men, are priced at either 50p or £1.

Unemployed Vicky Robinson and her friend Natalie Bennett were only too eager to visit the new eatery and claimed the restaurant would be good for the area.

Vicky, 19, said: 'It's good, very good. I just had a coffee but having a cheap place to eat brings more people to the area.'

Natalie, 31, who had a sausage bap 
and a cup of tea for £2, added: 'It was very nice and lovely for the 
price, I'll be back tomorrow.

'It's important to have cheap places to eat, especially round here. It's good for the people of Kirkby.'

Poundcafe opened in Kirkby because of the ongoing attempts to regenerate the area.

Upton Park Market, East London: Muhammad Nazir sold fish at his Upton Park market stall in East London for £1 and became an internet sensation with his catchy sales song.

Keeley Palin, marketing manager for 
Poundcafe, said: 'We started in Leigh with pasties and pastries for one 
pound or less two years ago and opened our 60th store today.

'We wanted to introduce a cafe where customers can come in and sit down to have a meal and this is the first one in the country.

'We chose Kirkby because we knew it would have a lot of footfall and there is a lot of regeneration going on locally.

'I think we've had around 300 people in the first hour-and-a-half and we've been rushed off our feet.'

Kirkby
is situated around 10 miles from Liverpool city centre which is 
bustling thanks to European funding but Knowlsey has one of the highest 
unemployment rates in the UK.

Researchers
at Sheffield Hallam University claimed in a recent study, 'Real Level 
of Unemployment', that there are 16,200 people of working age - the 
equivalent of 16.1 per cent - without jobs in the borough.

Unemployment levels are measured by the number claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) and official figues had the figure at 6,480 - only 6.7 per cent.

The study was published last September and is the fourth carried out by the university since 1997.

Cathy Fulton, Regional Manager for Poundcafe said: 'This is such an exciting time for us and we're delighted to be opening our very first cafe here in Kirkby.

'It will be great to offer customers a place where they can catch up with friends and enjoy some delicious, freshly made food without having to break their bank balance.

'For customers who are looking for food on the go then the Poundbakery shop is adjoined to the Poundcafe so we have the perfect alternative.'

The new cafe comes after Stoke-on-Trent council announced it was selling off house in rundown Cobridge to try and regenerate the area.

Six hundred people applied for the chance to own one of 35 empty two and three bedroom homes.

Applicants had to already live in the 
area, work but have a joint income of less than £30,000, have the right 
to live in the UK, have no other homes and agree to live there for five 
years.
