A headteacher who introduced a policy of handing out razor blades to a pupil so they could self harm 'safely' at school has been cleared of misconduct.

Laura Blair, the former head of Unsted Park School - a specialist school in Surrey for children with Asperger’s syndrome and ‘higher functioning autism’ - was investigated after whistleblowers at the school alerted the authorities.

However a disciplinary panel of the National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL) has now cleared Miss Blair of unacceptable professional conduct.

The panel heard how the headteacher allowed a ‘controlled self-harm’ policy at the school in Godalming, in a bid to control the behaviour of a single pupil, referred to as Pupil A, who had a history of self harming.

Just six days after the policy was launched a number of whistleblowers at the school raised concerns - saying they were worried the pupil could accidentally kill themselves - and the policy was scrapped by the headteacher.

The panel heard how the pupil was given a ‘sterile disposable razor blade’ and was allowed in a room by themselves so they could ‘self harm’ - with a teacher checking in on them every five-10 minutes.

When the pupil had finished, teachers would dress and clean the wounds.

A spokeswoman for the Priory Group, which is responsible for running the school, said last year that it was a ‘short term procedure’ in the ‘best interests of the pupil’ after it was introduced in January 2012.

George Brown, a former child support worker at the school, told the panel this week that he had raised concerns that the pupil ‘could bleed to death in as little as two minutes if an artery was cut’.

But the NCTL panel this week found that the former head - who left the school after her botched policy came to light in March last year - was not guilty of unacceptable professional conduct.

The panel ruled that the ‘controlled self harm policy’ was ill-advised and ‘badly thought out’, but that it came about because of ‘failings in communication’ between school chiefs and a ‘lack of experience’ of Miss Blair’s part.

John Pemberton, the chair of the panel, said that Miss Blair was responsible for the policy, saying that she had told them ‘Pupil A’s behaviour was becoming an increasing cause for concern’.

He said that Miss Blair ‘failed to follow best practices’ due to her lack of experience and her keenness to help Pupil A.

He told the panel: 'She said that she won’t make the same mistake again and the panel accepts this.'

The school principal Steve Dempsey and general manager Phil Jonas were both cleared of any involvement in the policy.

A spokesman for the Priory Group, which runs the school, said: 'The company notes the decision of the NCTL.'

Siobhan Freegard, founder of parenting website Netmums said: 'Children who self harm need intense help and support - but this sends out the wrong signals.

'Having an adult in a position of authority not only condone your actions but assist you in them could make children think the behaviour is normal and not a danger to them.

'While the clearly teacher felt she was acting in the child's best interests, it may show that specialists in this area need more training and guidance.

'Self harm is a cry for help and shows kids are not coping.

'They need love and care to get to the root of their issues, not a razor blade to slash open their skin.'

A spokesperson from charity Selfharm.co.uk said when the policy was revealed last year: 'The issue of controlled self-harm has proven to be effective in some areas, but only under the correct supervision.

'Self-harm is sometimes the safest option for a young person - if they’re using self-harm to make life a bit easier to manage, then taking it away from them without replacing it with something else can actually bring on a desperate kind of depression that could make them slide from self-harm to having suicidal ideation.

'I’d rather someone be self-harming in a way they can manage as safely as possible than be left stranded with no way to cope and be thinking about more desperate measures.

'In essence, it’s not possible to say that it’s a right or wrong approach to dealing with self-harm in young people - that judgment comes down to how it’s being supported, the policies in place and the point at which someone is deemed appropriate to engage in such a programme.

'I’d be horrified if a school was trying to manage such a scheme, but open-minded to an appropriate residential facility implementing it as one of many care pathways.'
