In shock: James Lovell's devastated family exits the church shortly after his funeral

Former ‘Today’ host Ann Curry joined the Friday morning mass of mourners at the funeral for a former colleague killed in Sunday’s Metro-North train derailment.

Ms Curry, 57, wore all-black to the funeral, in upstate Cold Spring, of James Lovell, a sound a lighting expert who worked over 20 years at NBC.

She was notably the only member of the ‘Today’ cast that attended the services. Matt Lauer and Today's executive producer Don Nash attended a private wake held the day before.

Mr Lovell, 58, died in the horrific train derailment as he was on his way to work on the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, according to the New York Daily News.

He rode the same train to work for more than two decades without incident until this past weekend’s fatal wreck.

The accident killed four passengers and injured dozens after the train sped 82MPH around a curve with a 30MPH speed restriction, causing it to jump the tracks and careen out of control towards the Harlem River.

The day’s somber mode was matched by a cold, dreary day that saw biting winds and light rain fall on the huge crowd that turned out to pay their final respects.

He is survived by his wife and four children – a daughter and three sons who sat with mother Nancy in the front pew next to their goon-too-soon father’s casket, according to the Daily News.

Tears were shed both inside the church and out. Mr Lovell’s young sons were visibly shaken up, crying as they walked outside into the damp, dark December morning.

Matt Lauer paid his respects via Twitter.

‘He was a talented and kind friend and colleague. We miss him already. Rest in peace Jim.’

Mr Lovell was laid to rest shortly after the service.
