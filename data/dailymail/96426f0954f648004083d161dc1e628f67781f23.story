Outspoken Tasmania senator Jacqui Lambie has again hit out at 'evil' Islamic extremists branding those who follow Sharia law 'monsters', 'maniacs and depraved humans'.

In an address to parliament on Monday, the Palmer United Party member said 'These thugs and extremists will not stop their acts of terrorism and depravity until their way of life, their culture and their law is imposed on Australia - indeed the whole world.'

'These maniacs and depraved humans will not stop committing their cold blooded butchery and rapes until every woman in Australia wears a burqa and is subservient to men,' Senator Lambie continued, the ABC report. 

The controversial party member also acknowledged her difficulty in explaining Sharia law following an awkward interview with ABC Insiders on Sunday morning.

Senator Jacqui Lambie said in parliament on Monday that  those who follow sharia law are 'maniacs and depraved humans.

'It's not going to come as a shock when I tell you that I'm not an Islamic scholar,' Ms Lambie admitted. 

Sharia law is the moral, legal and religious code followed by all Muslims, but made notorious by extremist groups like Islamic State wanting to implement hard-line aspects of Islamic law. 

During the long address on Monday, Ms Lambie also said 'every major terrorist attack in the western world' such as 911, the Bali Bombings, the Boston marathon bombings and 'recent beheadings and massacres' had been carried out by supporters of sharia law.

Senator Lambie also spoke of sending troops over to fight in Iraq and other parts of the middle east, and suggested: 'We need to get rid of them (Islamic extremeists) and their associates on home soil' first.

'Clean up the rubbish in your own backyard before you try to clean up the rubbish in others', she added. 

Senator Lambie also labelled Sharia as 'a law made up by men who hate women', and said if Islamic extremists were to take over Australia there would be no separation of church and state.

On Sunday, Palmer United Party leader Clive Palmer said the statements made by Ms Lambie about sharia law and burqas on the ABC earlier that day do not reflect the views of the party.

On Sunday morning Jacqui Lambie equated sharia law with acts of terrorism in a train-wreck television interview. 

On Sunday morning the PUP senator said on ABC's Insiders that sharia law involved terrorism

Ms Lambie (left with PUP party leader Clive Palmer and right) has reiterated her tough stance on Islam many times over the past week

Clive Palmer distanced himself from the outlandish comments, and told Fairfax Media: 'Party policy is determined by a meeting of the members and is announced by the leader'. 

This follows his tweets earlier in the day where he said Australian's need to 'remain united' as they have 'strong obligations towards each other'.

Ms Lambie appeared on ABC's Insiders on Sunday morning and struggled to explain what she thought sharia law was when asked by the show's presenter Barrie Cassidy.

In the interview, Ms Lambie also reiterated her tough stance against the moral code.

'If you are not going to show your allegiance to our law, then get out,' she said.

But Ms Lambie was left tongue-tied when asked what she understood sharia to mean.

'Well I think...when it comes to...sharia law...you know to me...it obviously involves terrorism,' she told Mr Cassidy.

'It involves a power that is not a healthy power.'

In comments likely to inflame current tensions with the Islamic community in Australia, Senator Lambie suggested even moderate Muslims should abandon their faith because of sharia.

Senator Lambie shared this post on her public Facebook page on Thursday night as part of her 'ban the burqa' campaign

But she said she had no problems with Muslims.

'I have a problem with extremists and sharia law,' Ms Lambie said.

'I want to see their full allegiance - not 50 per cent to the Australian constitution and Australian law.

'It is one law for all - that is the Australian law, full stop.'

A number of Australian Muslims have complained of being targeted following last week's terror raids, with women abused in the street and one having coffee thrown in her face while stopped at traffic lights in Brisbane. 

Amid all this Prime Minister Tony Abbott called for tolerance towards Australian Muslims, who he has described as 'absolutely first-class Australians'.

But his stance has not been helped by some in his own party, with Liberal senator Cory Bernardi using the raids to reignite his long-running campaign to ban the burqa. 

Ms Lambie is part of the Palmer United Party, which is headed by Queensland mining magnate Clive Palmer

Mr Palmer sought to distance himself from Ms Lambie's comments right after Insiders

He called for Australians to 'remain united' as they had 'strong obligations towards each other'

Senator Lambie again threw her weight behind a burqa ban, labelling it a 'national security issue'.

'It is like a motorbike helmet. It is like a balaclava,' she said.

'I will not allow you to wear that into my office because it is a security risk.' 

PUP leader Clive Palmer sought to distance himself from Ms Lambie's comments on Sunday.

Immediately after the show, the mining magnate tweeted: 'Australians need to remain united, we are a rich & diverse nation who enjoy a special country.'

But @escalator2nowhr had another take on the Jacqui Lambie situation

Leigh West questioned Ms Lambie's want of banning something she did not actually know about

Ms Lambie's comments also attracted criticism from social media users.

The firebrand senator has also spoken out about what she looks for in a partner, saying they had to be well endowed

'#Insiders interview of JLamie this morning...disturbing. Cringed over he ignorance of Sharia Law despite wanting to ban it,' @nerdygirl2424 tweeted.

While @escalator2nowhr took a more humorous stance: Are we absolutely sure Jacqui Lambie isn't just a new Chris Lilley character?' 

Chris Lilley is an Australian comedian known for his sometimes controversial characters.

Earlier this week, Ms Lambie caused a storm of controversy when she shared a photograph on Facebook of a woman dressed in a burqa and holding a gun. 

The woman in the photo is believed to be Afghanistan's first female police officer who was gunned down while fighting against Taliban extremists.

The senator was using the photo in a campaign to 'ban the burqa' for security reasons after Australia experienced the largest counter-terrorism operation in the country's history on Thursday.

Ms Lambie shared the image posted by far right British group Britain First in response to Senator Cory Bernardi's opposition to the full-length garb worn by some Islamic women.

On Thursday, about 800 police officers executed 25 search warrants in Sydney and Brisbane, resulting in 15 people arrested but only two people charged. 

Ms Lambie and PUP party leader Clive Palmer have been contacted by Daily Mail Australia for comment.
