A couple appeared in court in France yesterday accused of stashing some £50 million-worth of stolen Picasso art treasures in their garage.

Pierre Le Guennec, 74, and his wife Danielle, 73, face up to 10 years in prison for handling the goods, but insist that they were all ‘presents’ from the legendary Spanish artist.

It was in November 2010 that 271 lithographs, cubist paintings, notebooks and a watercolour were found at their modest home in Mouans-Sartoux, in the South of France.

In a court in nearby Grasse lawyers for six of Picasso’s descendants accused them of hiding the ‘fraudulently obtained’ haul.

Mr Le Guennec, 75, claims he was given the collection by the artist and his second wife, Jacqueline, when he was an odd job man at their home in Notre-Dame-de-Vie in Mougins, near Cannes.

Mr Le Guennec installed a burglar alarm at the luxury villa before the artist died in 1973, and said he accepted them as ‘thank you’ gifts.

Referring to Picasso, Mr Le Guennec said he ‘often invited me in to have some cake or a coffee. Me and the master talked about all things great and small. One evening, I was leaving my work, when Madame handed me a little package saying: "This is for you".'

But Claude Picasso, the artist’s son, said that his father was noted for his generosity, but that he always dedicated, dated and signed his gifts, as he knew that some recipients might try to sell the works one day.

Jean-Jacques Neuer, Claude Picasso’s barrister, said: ‘They don’t remember whether they received the so called gift in 1970, 71 or 72. If you are given 271 Picassos, you remember it.

‘You have to imagine that Picasso kept hold of them for 70 years and suddenly decided to give the lot away. That’s doesn’t make sense.’

The only document with the name Le Guennec on is a signed brochure for a Picasso exhibition, said Mr Neuer. adding: ‘When you give a present, you choose something precise that fits the person.

‘Picasso here is giving away works that have nothing to do with each other - notably extremely precious cubist collages that represent 10 per cent of his production,’ he said.

‘But also two notebooks of drawings, work tools that he would never have given away. The issue is not whether Picasso was generous or not. Picasso wasn’t someone who was careless about his works – he didn’t give away just for the sake of it.’

Charles-Etienne Gudin, lawyer for the couple, said the works came from the artist’s ‘Grands-Augustins’ studio on Paris’s Left Bank.

He said that Mr Le Guennec would never have stolen the Picasso’s villa, describing it as a ‘fortress’ watched over night and day by security guards.

The trial, which is due to last three weeks, comes after Marina Picasso, the artist’s granddaughter, said she was selling off the famous villa, along with a selection of his work, for up to £190m.

Ms Picasso wrote a memoir ‘Picasso: My Grandfather’ in 2001, in which she accused him of destroying her childhood. Picasso’s works are the most stolen of any artist in history.

He has more than 1,000 paintings registered as taken unlawfully, missing or disputed.
