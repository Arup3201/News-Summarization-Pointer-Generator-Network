A seven-year-old girl battling cancer has arrived in America for proton beam therapy, after strangers helped raise more than £180,000 so her parents didn't have to sell their family home.

Frankie-Rose Lea, left the UK on Tuesday with her parents Michelle and Sam Lea,  and brothers Alfie, 11, and Freddie, five.

Proton beam therapy, which the family hope  will save Frankie’s life after her tumour tripled in size, will start at a clinic in Oklahoma City this week.

The family faced a setback before they got on the plane as there were fears that Frankie-Rose, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour in August, would not be fit to fly. 

Frankie-Rose Lea, seven, has arrived in America to receive proton beam therapy treatment for her cancer. Well-wishers donated £180,00 for her treatment. Here, Frankie is pictured thanking readers for their donations

Frankie-Rose's parents Michelle and Sam updated her Facebook followers, revealing the family were off to America on Monday afternoon. She said a 'heartfelt thanks' to all their supporters 

Initially, Michelle and Sam Lea, pictured with their sons Alfie (right) and Freddie (left) had vowed sell their family home in a bid to raise £160,000 to fund treatment for Frankie-Rose (centre). But their story received widespread publicity, spurring donations from  well-wishers

A scan revealed a dangerous build of fluid on her brain which indicated she might have needed surgery.

The news came shortly after her family and friends raised funds for the treatment, which is not currently available in the UK.

Frankie-Rose was admitted to hospital last Wednesday where it was originally feared a shunt on her brain to drain a build-up of fluid  had stopped working and she would need to undergo emergency brain surgery.

But her parents were relieved when doctors found the shunt was working, and successfully cleared the build up without the need for surgery.

They were then given the green light to fly to America for the treatment they hope will save Frankie’s life.

The family initially put their home on the market for £50,000 less than it's market value to try and raise the money for Frankie-Rose's treatment quickly.

But her plight gained a huge amount of publicity and donations from well wishers meant the family have raised £185,371 to date.

Doctors said the proton beam therapy treatment offers Frankie-Rose the best chance of survival. Without it, she may not live past Christmas, they said

This means they will no longer have to sell their family home in Kent.

The family will now stay together in accommodation near the hospital in Oklahoma City where Frankie-Rose will be treated for one hour a day between Monday and Friday for two months.

It means they will be able to spend Christmas together in America.

Before she left for America, mother Michelle, 36, a dinner lady, revealed the family had been told that the NHS would not have funded Frankie-Rose to have proton beam therapy because her tumour is too aggressive.

Proton beam therapy is an advanced form of radiotherapy that targets tumours with great precision.

The radiation that uses beams of protons - small parts of an atom - rather than high energy X-rays, used in conventional radiotherapy.

Unlike an X-ray, the proton stops after striking the target rather than continuing to travel through the body.

It enables therapists to direct the beam at a tumour more precisely.

The beam can be more finely controlled, in both its width and its depth, so higher doses of radiation can be more safely delivered to tumours, with less risk to healthy tissues.

The treatment has been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of many different tumours, including those found in the head and neck, eye, central nervous system, lung, prostate and gastrointestinal tract.

The precision of the pencil beam scanning makes it especially beneficial in treating tumours adjacent to critical and sensitive organs, such as the eye, brain and spinal cord.

She said: ‘Even if we had have applied for funding we wouldn’t have got it so thank goodness we started fundraising.’

She also spoke of her joy at not having to sell the family home and the importance of being able to stay together as a family.

She said: ‘Friends, family, everyone that donated, thank you, from the bottom of our hearts.

‘It’s so important for us to be able to stay together at a time like this. As parents you want to be there for all your children and that is what keeps you strong.

‘I’m in awe of the way people have rallied together to help us, our friends and family have been incredible and the kindness of complete strangers has restored my faith in everything.’

But she added that she hoped her daughter’s case would highlight the need for proton beam therapy to be available in the UK sooner rather than later.

She said: ‘We are the lucky ones because we have amazing friends and family who have helped us and the public support has been overwhelming, but we still feel that Frankie-Rose and every other patient should be able to access this therapy in the UK.

‘When you are dealing with the news that your child or someone you love has cancer you want to be supporting them and spending time together not desperately fundraising and searching for treatment to try and save them.

‘We need it here now, not in five years time and I hope what happened to us helps make that possible for another family so they don’t have to go through this.’

They now plan to keep their 9,000 followers on Facebook updated with Frankie-Rose’s progress and on Monday evening posted a status with the news that they were set to travel to the states.

It said: 'Dear friends, family, donators and well wishers…Everyone who has helped us achieve the following. 

'We are off to America at 6am tomorrow morning. Our heartfelt thanks to you all for your help it means we will be together at Christmas getting the best medicine we can. See you next year…Feeling positive.’

Mr and Mrs Lea had planned to cancel their August wedding, after Frankie-Rose, was diagnosed the same month. But the seven-year-old told her parents she was desperate to be a bridesmaid

The comment was met with a surge of over 2,000 likes from supporters.

A family friend told MailOnline Frankie-Rose and her parents were in good spirits when they left their south London home yesterday morning.

She said: ‘They were feeling really happy and positive to be on their way at last. It’s been a rollercoaster but they got there and Frankie-Rose was smiling.

‘I cannot express how much they appreciate the support they have had from the public across Britain and even worldwide as well as all their family and friends in London. 

'Everyone has worked so hard to make this possible and it means so much to them.

‘They they were just so pleased and relieved to be on their way to getting their daughter the best medicine.’

Though the target has been met to cover the initial cost of treatment the fund raising page remains open to help meet the ongoing cost of after care and future treatment Frankie-Rose might need.
