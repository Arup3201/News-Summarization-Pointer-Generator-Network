England footballers have given a vote of confidence to team agents 1966 before the World Cup in Brazil by renewing their four-year contract until after the 2018 tournament in Russia.

The new deal with 1966, who look after the players’ interests in all the FA’s commercial deals involving the England team, was agreed by the players’ committee of Steven Gerrard, Wayne Rooney, Joe Hart, James Milner and Gareth Barry without the tender process that had happened in 2010.

1966, run by Terry Byrne, David Beckham’s former personal manager, enjoy a better relationship with the FA in handling the tricky issue of players’ personal appearances for sponsors than they have in the past.

Team England have been represented by 1966 since 2006, when music mogul Simon Fuller offered to work for free. But he has not been involved in the business since 2008.

Barry, seemingly no longer part of Roy Hodgson’s England plans, is likely to step down from the players’ committee after the World Cup.

Meanwhile, there hasn’t been time for Vauxhall to film their World Cup advert this week, such have been the needs of England sponsors at the one squad get-together before the World Cup party is named.

The promised involvement of A-list players must now be fitted into a week without internationals — complicated for the FA and 1966.

The Premier League, aware that giant parachute payments distort competition in the Championship and put that division’s Financial Fair Play regulations out of kilter, held a club summit in Stoke on Wednesday to review the format; there is another one in London on Thursday. But it’s unlikely any PL team will vote for a reduction in parachute payments while the TV rights market remains so buoyant. Clubs were told absent PL chairman Anthony Fry was ill.

BBC Sport are set to axe the radio commentary of the Boat Race on April 6, instead using the TV feed. This will save a minimal amount, while making a mockery of a radio heritage that includes John Snagge saying in 1949: ‘I can’t see who’s ahead; it’s either Oxford or Cambridge.’ Five Live complained in 2011 about difficulties setting up BT ISDN lines at Mortlake, which is hardly the Outer Hebrides. A BBC spokeswoman could not confirm Boat Race plans on Wednesday.

The 19-sport European Games in Baku in 2015, little more than a vanity project for oil-rich Azerbaijan, will find it that much harder to sell the event in a crowded calendar now director of communications Darryl Seibel, the consummate PR expert who left the British Olympic Association after Sochi, has chosen not to work in Baku. This follows a falling-out with Azerbaijan’s government, who were unhappy Seibel put his BOA commitments around medal winners ahead of a Baku reception in Sochi.

Harry’s name Games

The American initiative of a Warrior Games — giving wounded armed forces members the chance to compete in a multi-sport event — is to be renamed on Thursday ahead of its British launch at the Olympic Park in the autumn.

The big test will be giving the competition the razzmatazz it received in the US, where team captain Prince Harry was enthused enough to announce the event should come to London.

The Stratford location still resembles a building site, although the velodrome, the Copper Box and the aquatic centre will all be used for the event — likely to be tagged Harry’s Games even if rebranded the Invictus Games.

TalkSPORT’s decision to host Wednesdays’s drivetime programme from a branded, glass-fronted cabin on Wembley Way with tens of thousands walking past en route to the England-Denmark game might have seemed a good idea when planned, but that was before co-presenter Darren Gough was front-page news for reportedly walking out on his wife after striking up an alleged friendship with TOWIE star Amy Childs. No wonder Darren was wearing dark glasses in the makeshift studio.
