Bad teacher: Michelle Ladd, 41, a married teacher from Indiana, has been charged with having sexual relationships with two 17-year-old students 

A 41-year-old teacher from Indiana has been charged with having sex with two 17-year-old students and giving them thousands of dollars’ worth of gifts, including alcohol, guns and cars.

Michelle Ladd, of Miami County, was arrested Monday on charges of child seduction, unlawful transfer of a handgun and providing alcohol to a minor.

Investigators with the Miami County Sheriff's Office say the instructional assistant with the Maconaquah School Corporation's alternative program started a relationship with one of her students in 2010 after she and her husband hired the 17-year-old to work on their farm to earn some extra cash.

During an interview with police, the boy said his first sexual encounter with the teacher took place at her home where he stayed for two weeks.

Court documents cited by Fox59 state that in the course of their affair, which lasted until the summer of 2013, the married teacher's aide bought the victim alcohol and two cars.

As her first affair was winding down, Ladd allegedly began exchanging sexually explicit text messages with another 17-year-old boy nor long after he was released from a juvenile center, where he had been sent for committing a burglary.

The teen told sheriff’s deputies he and Ladd consummated their relationship for the first time in April 2013, and the pair continued seeing each other romantically until November 2014, reported Kokomo Tribune. 

According to investigators, Ladd again was showering her teenage lover with presents, which included handguns, despite his criminal history.

When questioned by police last month, Ladd allegedly admitted to both trysts.

Maconaquah School Corporation Superintendent Dr. Doug Arnold said news of Ladd's arrest came as a shock to him because the educator has been effective in the classroom, working with middle and high school students struggling with homework or social skills.

Mrs Ladd has been released on $56,000 bond. She is due back in court February 19.
