Four-time Formula One world champion Alain Prost has revealed he’s been left ‘furious’ and ‘shocked’ by Jules Bianchi’s horror crash at the Japanese Grand Prix.

Prost’s countryman Bianchi remains in a grave condition at the Mie University Hospital after his Marussia ploughed into the back of a recovery vehicle during the closing stages of the rain-lashed race.

The Formula One grid united in their support for the 25-year-old with a moment of silence in the build up to the inaugural Russian Grand Prix, won by Lewis Hamilton.

Alain Prost has blasted the safety procedures in Japan, questioning why there was a 'f****** truck on the track'

Race director Charlie Whiting has filed a report on the tragic events in Suzuka at the request of FIA president Jean Todt.

Double waved yellows were issued at the scene of Sutil’s accident, in favour of a safety car, despite a tractor being dispatched to recover the German’s Sauber - a decision which Prost believes was fundamentally wrong.

‘It is cars and tracks that have been improved and there was only one thing left: it was this f****** truck on the track,' said Prost.

‘I was furious. I was really shocked by the accident.’

The Japanese race started under the safety car before the torrid weather conditions saw the race postponed with only two laps completed. The race later re-started behind the pace car once more which then pitted at the end of lap 10.

‘It was safe in the beginning when it started with the safety car, because it was a difficult decision to stop the race after three or four laps and start again,' Prost told Autosport.

‘That is why I was shocked, because you take the right decision at one stage.

‘It is huge bad luck, but you should not judge the cause of the accident, you should judge the consequence. You don’t want to have that.

‘If it was my son, I wouldn’t want this type of accident with a truck on an F1 track. That is what I cannot accept.’
