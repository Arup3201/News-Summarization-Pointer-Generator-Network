Attorneys for the family of a Georgia teenager who was found dead in a rolled-up wrestling mat have claimed video footage of his final moments was doctored.

Attorneys Benjamin Crump and Chevene King argued 
that video released by authorities showing Kendrick Johnson's last 
moments at Lowndes High School appears to skip and that key footage showing the wrestling mats 
where his body was found was dark and blurry.

Their accusations come as a report written by the initial coroner in the case has also emerged, blasting authorities for their handling of the scene. Coroner Bill Watson wrote that the body had been moved by the time he arrived and that evidence bags were later opened.

Final moments: In footage released by authorities in Lowndes County, Kendrick Johnson is seen running into the gymnasium just moments before he died. He was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat

Bizarre: But in the next frame, Johnson is nowhere to be seen and other high school students are playing basketball, leading his family's attorneys to accuse authorities of doctoring the footage

The death of Johnson on January 11 
this year in Lowndes County was initially ruled accidental, but his 
parents have been calling for justice ever since, claiming he was 
killed.

After they disputed
the coroner's conclusion, they requested an independent autopsy that 
found Johnson died of blunt force trauma.

Following the revelation, a judge ordered for the footage from the high school to be released but now the family's attorneys have accused authorities of doctoring the footage.

'We believe that the tape is proof that 
there is some conspiracy to conceal the truth from this family and the 
public as to who killed Kendrick Johnson,' Crump said. 'We believe that somebody 
corrupted this video.'

The surveillance video shows Kendrick walking along a school hallway at 12.59pm on January 10 wearing a white T-shirt, jeans and white sneakers. He is also carrying a yellow folder or book.

The next clip is 10 minutes later at 1.09pm when Kendrick in the gym where he was later found dead.

Missed: The death of Kendrick Johnson, 17, was ruled accidental but his parents believe he was killed

Tragic: He is pictured heading to the gym, left, where he was found dead, right, after he failed to return home

Another student is seen walking in ahead of him. It is less than two seconds long and shows Kendrick walk out of the shot before what appears to be a dissolve edit between that clip and another showing students playing basketball. It's unclear how much time has passed between the two clips.

The attorney claims that time stamps were on freeze frames of the footage but not on the footage itself.

Attorney Chevene King added that Lowndes
County Sheriff’s officials had violated the judge's ruling to provide 
key evidence collected in the case and accused them of tampering with 
the video, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported.

'We feel that 
when you look at what photographs have been given, you must come to the 
conclusion that there were time codes that were part of the video that 
were either deleted or in some way made impossible to get any 
information from,' King said.

They added that one camera, which is 
pointed directly at where the wrestling mats are kept in the gym, only 
shows footage that is blurry and dark.

Questions: His family's attorneys, Chevene King (left) and Benjamin Crump (right), pictured on CNN last month, said that the footage has been doctored and that key parts are blurry and dark

Distraught: Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson have been calling for justice since their son died in January

'Is it a coincidence that the one camera out of 36 cameras which we were given tape from … this is the only camera out of focus and does not give you a clear image?' King asked.

CNN has also obtained a report in which the coroner slammed how the initial investigation was handled. He calls the investigative scene 'very poor'.

'The body had been noticably [sic] moved,' Lowndes County Coroner Bill Watson wrote in a report dated January 22.

'The scene had been compromised and there was no cooperation from law enforcement at the scene. Furthermore the integrity of the evidence bag was compromised on January 13, 2013 by opening the sealed bag and exhibiting the dead body to his father.'

He continued: 'I do not approve of the manner this case was handled.'

The 17-year-old's body was found stuck in an upright mat that had been rolled up and propped upright behind bleachers in the school gym after his parents reported him missing the night before.

Twist: When his body was exhumed for further investigations, it was found to be missing its organs and stuffed with newspaper instead. An independent autopsy found he died of blunt force trauma

The sheriff has said he suspects Johnson
became trapped trying to retrieve a shoe that fell into the center of 
the large, rolled mat.

A Georgia Bureau of Investigation medical examiner concluded that he died from positional asphyxia, meaning his body got stuck in a position in which he couldn't breathe.

Despite Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluding the death was a freak accident, his parents, Kenneth and Jacquelyn, insist that someone must have killed him.

And in a further twist in the case, a 
private pathologist opened his body earlier this year to find his organs
missing and replaced with newspaper.

Dr. William R. Anderson issued a report in August saying he detected hemorrhaging on the right side of Johnson's neck. He concluded the teenager died from blunt force trauma near his carotid artery and that the fatal blow appeared to be non-accidental.
