Bob the security robot moves around at the G4S Technology offices in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire

It may look more like the robot from 'Lost in Space' than the terrifying droids in 'Terminator', but this machine could be the future of fighting crime.

Bob, the first robotic security guard in the UK, is the latest recruit employed by G4S to help secure its headquarters in Gloucestershire.

When the metal minder spots something out of place, he stores the information on his internal hard-drive and quickly reports it to his human counterparts.

The autonomous android can even speak to his colleagues, ask for help when he gets stuck, and plug himself in to charge when his battery runs low.

The blue machine is part of a £7.2 million ($12.2 million) robot pilot project by the University of Birmingham to get robots in offices around the world.

‘Bob is not about replacing our security officers; the security officers are at the point of use,’ said G4S spokesman Stewart Angell.

‘They are able to make incisive, very, very quick decisions about changes in the environment.

‘Bob is a complimentary activity that can do guard tours over a period of time overnight or during the day, but also pick up on some of the low level activities that the guard doesn't necessary need to be involved in.’

Bob knows the floor plan of the office in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, and rolls from room to room, scanning and filming in 3D.

If he spots something has changed since his last visit, he analyses it and sends the information to a real security guard.   

Using cameras and scanners he is able to create a map of his surrounding area, plotting the location of desks and chairs, as well as detecting people moving, and learning how the environment changes.

It is hoped the pilot project will help Bob (pictured) learn more about coping with other people - and machines - in the workplace

It is hoped the pilot project will help Bob learn more about coping with other people - and machines - in the workplace. 

Dr Nick Hawes, from the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, said: ‘Current robots aren't very good with their hands, or able to manipulate objects, however Bob is good at driving around and monitoring objects, so is perfect for a job in security as a night or day watchman where he can monitor what is going on in his immediate surroundings. 

‘We want to see Bob survive on his own for up to 15 days, doing jobs that are useful for security, for example, checking whether fire doors are obstructed, whether there is paper on desks.’

The project is being led by the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham.

A similar robot called Werner is currently being tested in a care home in Vienna, Austria, as part of the same project.

Werner will carry out similar security duties to Bob, but he is also able to play simple games with residents in the home.

In a country dominated by 'kawaii' - or cute culture - Japan has embraced the rise of cuddly robots.

Now, one Tokyo-based firm has unveiled what it believes to be the world's first droid that can read human emotions.

Mobile carrier Softbank said its robot, named Pepper, will go on sale in Japan in February for 198,000 yen (£1,130 or $1,900).

The machine, which has no legs, but has gesticulating hands appeared on a stage in a Tokyo suburb, cooing and humming. 

Pepper uses an 'emotional engine' and a cloud-based artificial intelligence to study gestures, expressions and human speech tones.

The 48-inch (121 cm) tall, 62 lb (28 kg) white Pepper has no hair, but two large doll-like eyes and a flat-panel display stuck on its chest.

It was developed jointly with Aldebaran Robotics, which designs, produces and sells autonomous humanoid robots.
