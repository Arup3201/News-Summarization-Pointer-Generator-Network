More than a decade after being sent to the war zone, the last British troops serving in Afghanistan are finally preparing to come home.

Thirteen years after arriving in Helmand Province, the remaining servicemen and women have begun packing up military equipment ahead of their long-awaited return.

In thanks for their service, a collection of stunning images documenting their final days at Camp Bastion has been shared across the UK. 

Among the images taken by acclaimed photographer Robert Wilson are portraits of the soldiers and landscapes of their living quarters. 

Rounds of artillery and weapon storage units are also depicted in the collection which offers astonishing insight into the realities of being at war. 

The 59 photographs are to be scattered across Britain in a bid to raise public appreciation of the soldiers' contribution and remind the country of how dangerous the conflict was.

More than 400 British troops have died in Afghanistan since 2002, with 2009 the bloodiest year of battle in which 109 died.

Two servicewomen are pictured in stunning portraits taken in Afghanistan. The image of the freckled soldier was taken in an area called Theatre Equipment Support (left) and will be displayed in Kettering while the other, of a woman eating a lollipop on her way back from dinner will appear in Stockton-on-Tees. Mr Wilson snapped the woman enjoying her sweet to capture normality. 'I was constantly looking for images of everyday items amongst the alien environment of a war zone,' he said

A bagpiper plays shortly before his battalion is due to be sent out 'beyond the wire' - past the perimeter fence. Traditionally he played vehicles out of the walls at Camp Bastion. His photograph will be shown in Etterick & Lauderdale on the Scottish Borders

A decorated blast wall at Camp Bastion shows murals by the troops created to commemorate their tour. Each section weighs around two tonnes so could not be brought home with the soldiers at the end of the year. They were all due to be whitewashed shortly after the photographer's departure earlier this year. This image will appear in North Avon 

A soldier welds pieces of metal into a rose to send home to a loved one in the Theatre Equipment Support area. The contrast of the harsh setting and material with the softness of the flower shape is what drew Mr Wilson to take the photograph, he said. It will be displayed in Milton Keynes

A soldier relaxes with a book and an iPad on his bed at Camp Bastion after returning from dinner. Most of the soldiers have been reduced  to tented accommodation as the drawback continues, with this particular tent sleeping ten troops.  The soldier's Spongebob Squarepants sheets give a nod to his life at home

Two soldiers relax after dinner in their tent at Camp Bastion, their uniforms displayed and trinkets from home scattered among hanging, fabric shelves. One soldier's machine gun rests readily at the end of his cot bed in the image which will be shown in Corby 

This portrait of a Tornado pilot at Kandahar International Airfield reflects an aircraft in the troop's helmet. The airfield is one of the military's largest bases, housing around hundred aircraft 

The view through the windscreen of a Foxhound patrol vehicle as it drives through the streets of Kabul while returning to Camp Souter from Camp Qargha. Two screens with views of the surrounding road from every angle of the car are among its high-tech features. The photograph will be displayed in Manchester

Tattoos were among the most personal examples of how soldiers reminded themselves of home. A female soldier shows off support of West Bromwich Albion Football Club in an image to be shown in Sandwell, West Bromwich, while another enjoys a Calipo in a rare moment of normality (right). Her artistic tattoo and engagement ring offer an insight into life back home. The picture will be shown in Bedford

The nose cone of a Boeing 747 is lifted to allow the plane to be loaded with equipment as soldiers pack up the remaining equipment at Camp Bastion. It is to be shown in Ipswich at a postal depot 

Rows of shiny bandoliers is one of the photographer's favourite images from the entire collection (left). The weaponry was being laid out for storage and cleaning after the Warthog armoured vehicle brigade returned from patrol. Guns were returned to ISO containers following the routine patrol (right)

This stunning landscape was taken at Camp Bastion. It shows Warthog armoured vehicles returning from a patrol, their heavy wheels turfing up sand and dust as the convoy roars past for around 20 minutes

Taken at the flight line of Camp Bastion where troops mainly service Apache and Chinook helicopters, this image resonated with Robert Wilson who lives close to Heathrow in London

A group of soldiers clean and pack away their equipment at Camp Bastion after one of the final Warthog patrols. Robert Wilson, who also visited the conflict zone in 2008, said the camp was calmer than it was six years ago but that the dangers of being there were still present 

An image taken in one of the RAF control rooms at Kandhar International Airport show headphones with servicemen and women's markings on them 

A lookout post - or 'sangar' - as referred to by the troops are scattered all over the camp. Each one is manned by eight troops who live there for two weeks at a time. Each has its own kitchen, solar shower and exercise area
