New love: Anna Ziuzina is now in a relationship with British company director Ivan Lister and pregnant

An internet bride whose millionaire husband was brutally murdered in the Ukraine is pregnant and in a relationship with another British businessman.

Former lap-dancer Anna Ziuzina, 34, has become romantically involved with a company director called Ivan Lister.

She has been staying in a flat the father-of-two recently bought for £295,000, just a few miles from his £2million home in north London.

The fashion-conscious ex-stripper – who is involved in a bitter dispute with her late husband’s family over his £1.5million estate - is driving a one-year-old, £20,000 Mini Cooper Countryman.

Prior to being asked about her relationship with Mr Lister, Miss Ziuzina told the Mail her life had been a ‘nightmare’ since her husband Barry Pring died.

But smartly dressed, she looked relaxed and happy in the company of her new man, who is listed at Companies House as being a director of Ochre Blue Ltd, a women's handbag and accessories firm. He is believed to have a professional interest in casinos and gambling, own a number of properties and drives an £80,000 Range Rover Sport.

Details of how Miss Ziuzina has formed a relationship with Bradford-born Mr Lister, 44, emerged as David Cameron dramatically intervened in the bungled investigation into the murder of her Mr Pring.

The British PM has written to his Ukrainian counterpart, demanding ‘all necessary steps’ are taken to prosecute those behind his death.

The development comes nearly two years after a Daily Mail investigation revealed the highly suspicious chain of events leading up to the death of Mr Pring, 47, who was run over in Kiev on the night he celebrated his first wedding anniversary with Miss Ziuzina.

We also exposed the Ukrainian authorities’ shambolic handling of the case, which has been mired in allegations of a cover-up involving corrupt police.

It is believed the local Mafia may have been involved in the plot to kill Mr Pring.

Mr Pring, originally from Devon, was struck by a car travelling at 80 mph as he waited for a cab on the hard shoulder of a deserted dual-carriageway on the outskirts of Kiev in February 2008.

The vehicle’s lights were switched off at the time of impact and debris found at the scene included false number plates and a bogus taxi sign.

Miss Ziuzina had been at his side a few minutes earlier but was standing with her back to the road when her husband was killed.

Although she never lived in Britain during their marriage and since his death has advertised herself as a ‘model’ in Miami, she was initially granted legal aid to fund her claim for a huge inheritance. But she is no longer in receipt of public funds.

At the time of our initial revelations in June 2011, the case was being treated as an unexplained ‘traffic accident’.

But in May last year, under pressure from the Foreign Office, detectives in the Ukraine officially upgraded their inquiry to murder.

Mr Cameron wrote to the Ukrainian Prime Minister Mykola Azarov about the case on April 5.

A Downing Street official said: ‘The 
Prime Minister highlighted the case to the Ukrainian Prime Minister and 
…. asked for the Ukrainian Prime Minister's assistance instructing the 
relevant authorities to take all necessary steps to bring their 
investigations to a conclusion and prosecute those responsible.’

The Ukrainian Police have now asked Devon and Cornwall Police for the initial statements made to them by Mr Pring’s family and friends, details of incoming and outgoing phone calls at his south-west London home, information on his finances and emails he sent and received in the years before his death.

Mr Pring owned a string of properties, drove two cars including a Lotus and ran an IT consultancy.

Prior to meeting Mr Pring, Miss Ziuzina worked at gentlemen’s clubs in Ukraine and Luxembourg.

But when she advertised for a husband on an international dating website, Mr Pring understood she was an English teacher.

When he found out several weeks into their relationship in 2006 that she worked in strip clubs, he persuaded her to give it up and set her up in a flat, paid her a living allowance and bought her a car.

They married in Kiev in January 2007 but had a long-distance relationship and only lived together for several weeks before his tragic death 13 months later.

Miss Ziuzina told the Mail she welcomed the intervention of Mr Cameron in her husband’s case.

She
said in an email: ‘I believe that it was a tragic accident. My husband 
was a lovely, kind man. No one, least of all me, could wish him to die. 
We were planning our life together. Since the accident my life has been
a nightmare. I loved Barry.

‘If those who responsible for his death are brought to justice, I can perhaps live without the pain I suffer every day from his loss and the ungrounded allegations brought against me by his family. ‘

At his home in north London, Mr Lister was reluctant to talk in detail about Miss Ziuzina.

When asked if he was in a relationship with her, he said: ‘Yeah, but I know nothing about her husband.’

Asked about Mr Pring’s death being upgraded to a murder inquiry, Mr Lister said: ‘It’s always been a murder investigation. She’s [Ziuzina] always been supporting the inquiries.

‘I’m supporting her through whatever happens. It’s fine.’

The Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs, which is responsible for policing in the country, told the Mail: ‘The case of Barry Pring's death is being investigated as a murder. We are not naming any suspects.’

Mr Pring’s brother, businessman Shaughan Pring, 50, who lives near Exeter, thanked the Daily Mail for exposing the case.

He said: ‘We are enormously grateful to the Daily Mail, whose initial, detailed investigation first raised concerns about my brother’s death.

‘We obviously appreciate David Cameron’s decision to intervene in this case.

‘We just hope the Ukrainians take appropriate action to bring those responsible to justice as quickly as possible.

‘If they had taken appropriate action five years, we would not be in this situation of waiting for justice now. The killers would already be in jail.’
