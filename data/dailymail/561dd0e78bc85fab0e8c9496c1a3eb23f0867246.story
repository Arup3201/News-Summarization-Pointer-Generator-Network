Disgraced: Bullying former MSP Bill Walker pictured arriving at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today repeatedly blamed his wives, the media and anyone he could think of for his own appalling behaviour

Disgraced former MSP Bill Walker has been jailed for 12 months for a string of attacks against his three former wives and a stepdaughter that spanned decades.

Walker, of Alloa in Clackmannanshire, was convicted of 23 charges of domestic abuse and one breach of the peace last month after a two-week trial.

The 71-year-old, who clung to his Dunfermline seat for 16 days after the verdict, returned to Edinburgh Sheriff Court today where he was sentenced by Sheriff Kathrine Mackie.

Sheriff Mackie found Walker guilty of assaulting his first wife Maureen Traquair on three separate occasions in the 1960s and 1980s.

On one occasion he assaulted her two weeks before their wedding in January 1967 punching her in the face and leaving her with a black eye.

Ms Traquair told the court she even had to buy concealer to hide the bruises from their family and friends on the couple’s wedding day.

Walker was also convicted of assaulting his second wife, Anne Gruber, 15 times between 1978 and 1984.

The court heard that on various occasions Mrs Gruber was punched, slapped, kicked and pushed to the ground.

In an astonishing catalogue of abuse Walker spat on her face, threw household items at her, threatened to pour hot coffee over her and pulled her hair.

He also breached the peace by leaping into Mrs Gruber’s home brandishing an air rifle after she went out for a birthday meal with another man.

Walker was also found guilty of assaulting and injuring Mrs Gruber’s 16-year-old daughter, Anne Louise Paterson, by repeatedly striking her on the head with a saucepan in 1978 until she was left

Mrs Gruber told the court: 'He turned on her and whacked her repeatedly over the head with a yellow saucepan that was so badly broken up it was put in the bin.

'He battered her so hard she was down on the floor. Her head was bleeding and she was bruised.'

The disgraced politician was found guilty of four assaults on his third wife Diana Walker, three of which involved slapping or punching her on the face.

The attacks on her happened between June 1988 and January 1995.

She told the court her husband also recorded her phone calls and made her sign an agreement to do all household chores in their home.

Walker’s crimes were committed at addresses in Edinburgh, Stirling, Midlothian and Alloa between 1967 and 1995.

Diana Walker told the court she spoke to journalists about her ex-husband after she felt 'mad' to hear that he was supporting a women’s aid project for victims of domestic abuse.

The former SNP MSP, who was suspended and later expelled from the party after the allegations surfaced in the Sunday Herald newspaper in March last year, denied all the charges.

Remarkably he maintained that he had acted in self-defence in relation to all three of them.

Giving evidence, Walker claimed he was the victim of 'smearing' and that his ex-wives colluded to accuse him of domestic violence.

But Sheriff Mackie said Walker was not a credible witness and the evidence shows he was 'controlling, domineering, demeaning and belittling' towards all his former wives.

She told him: 'Your 
incredulity at being convicted of these offences and your perceived 
victimisation are further indications of your abdication of 
responsibility for your behaviour.

'You
have shown what can only be described as contempt for your former wives
and your step daughter in the derogatory manner in which you refer to 
them.

'I formed the opinion that you have no understanding of the impact of domestic abuse on victims or children.

'I
have been unable to detect, either during the trial or in the reports, 
any evidence of remorse for anything or anyone except yourself.'

She added that given his 'extreme
denial' of his behaviour, it was unrealistic to expect Walker to engage
fully with any non-custodial domestic abuse programme.

Sheriff Mackie  also said it was clear from their evidence that to Walker’s former wives, his behaviour remained 'vivid and distressing.'

She added: 'Having
regard to the gravity of these offences as a result of the cumulative 
effect of them, your extreme denial and complete absence of any remorse,
and the assessment of risk, I have come to the conclusion that a 
custodial sentence is the only appropriate disposal.

Mrs Gruber was kicked, punched, slapped and pushed to the ground by her former husband who also once confronted her with an air rifle and viciously her daughter with a saucepan

'In
my opinion, the repeated abuse and violent behaviour towards your three
former wives and stepdaughter over a period of 28 years outweighs other
factors.'

She added: 'I formed the 
impression that in the few incidents where you acknowledged the use of 
physical force, you believed you were entitled to or justified in its 
use, and certainly have made no apology for it.

'Your
denial appears to me to be absolute. There is no acknowledgement of any
unacceptable behaviour, there is no indication of any motivation to 
change.

'The conclusion that 
there’s a significant scope to work with you to address your entrenched 
attitudes, value and beliefs surrounding domestic abuse is flawed.”

Walker initially refused to vacate his Holyrood seat after the verdict, despite pressure from campaigners and other MSPs, the vast majority of whom signed a motion calling for him to step down.

He faced having his salary cut by 90% if jailed, after the parliament’s corporate body recommended the move for MSPs who go to prison.

The politician finally resigned on September 7, blaming a 'media onslaught' that made it impossible for him to continue.

Walker was elected to the Scottish Parliament in a surprise victory for the SNP two years ago.

The by-election to fill his Dunfermline seat will be held on Thursday October 24.
