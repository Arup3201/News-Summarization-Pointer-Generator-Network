Footballer Ben Hayes, 18, has been jailed for four and a half years for killing a teenage peacemaker with a single punch in a post-party brawl

A trainee professional footballer who killed a peacemaker with a single punch when a drug-fuelled 16th birthday party ended in violence was jailed for four and a half years today.

Footballer Ben Hayes, 18, swung at trainee electrician George Verrier when he tried to stop a street brawl at the end of dancer Madison Moran’s celebrations.

Mr Verrier, 17, was able to walk away from the attack, but was found unconscious at a friend's house the following morning with severe bleeding on his brain, and died just hours later.

Police told him he needed to go to hospital, but refused to take him, with friends adding that officers told him to 'get a bus'. 

Hayes was convicted  of manslaughter at the Old Bailey and sentenced to four and a half years imprisonment in a young offender’s institute.

The victim’s family wept in court as sentence was passed.

In a statement read to the court, mother Laura Verrier described her son as a ‘healthy, funny and intelligent young man’ who ‘had his whole life ahead of him’.

She said: ‘The only comfort, if any, is that through George’s selflessness, he had completed an organ donor card, three people have been given a second chance at life.’

As Hayes was led away to the cells a man, who identified himself as the defendant’s brother, shouted obscenities from the public gallery about the judge and police before he was escorted out by security staff.

Judge Anthony Bate told Hayes: ‘You punched George because he got in your way.

‘A substantial term of imprisonment is inevitable for this grave offence.

‘The length of the punishment now imposed in no way equates to the enduring and profound loss felt by George’s family.

‘A healthy and intelligent young man had a promising future taken when you lashed out at him in a moment of hot temper.’

George Verrier, 17, was described by his mother as a 'healthy, funny and intelligent young man’ who ‘had his whole life ahead of him’

He continued: 'It’s plain that shortly before the killing your friends had twice tried to calm you down.

‘You remained angry, upset and pumped-up.

‘George intervened as a peacemaker and you struck him to the face.

‘He fell heavily and struck the right side of his head on the ground.’

Stephen Kamlish QC, defending Hayes, said in mitigation that he had a bright future ahead of him.

‘His football career has been cut short, he was on a list to go to the US for a year of scholarship at a sports university,’ he said.

Hayes and Mr Verrier had been among the guests at Brit School pupil Ms Moran’s party, thrown by her parents at their £500,000 home in Bromley.

The bash for the teenager, a trainee dancer at the prestigious arts school attended by Adele, Jessie J, and Amy Winehouse, was said to be well-organised, with bouncers on the door and wristbands for all guests.

However, Mr Kamlish said drug dealers were offering a rash of illegal drugs to the largely teenage guests.

‘The jury will hear drugs were being offered - ecstasy, cocaine, ketamine, and cannabis,' he said.

‘It was not just one person, but people were going around whispering "can I sell you something?".’

Violence flared up when the party ended at 12.30am, as hoards of partygoers flooded out on to the quiet residential street.

‘A number of local residents called the police, complaining about disorderly behaviour and fights involving large groups of youths’, said prosecutor Zoe Johnson QC.

She said one resident, Carly Mairs, saw up to 20 teenagers punching and shoving each other in the street, while another, Andy Finney, reported ‘fighting and general debauchery’.

‘He told the police he had seen six to eight lads kicking cars and fences, and urinating in the street’, she said.

‘He also observed couples having sex in full view, and he described being intimidated by the size and nature of the group.’

Hayes attacked Mr Verrier at around 1am, after chasing him down the street with a pack of other boys.

Max Kane, a pupil at The Ravensbourne School in Bromley, said Verrier was trying to break up a fight in the street when he was attacked.

‘George was absolutely no threat to Ben Hayes’, he told the court.

‘Ben looked angry, he looked like a ball of anger, like he wanted to explode and switch at someone.

‘He looked like he was there for a fight.

‘He punched him round the side of the face, in between the jaw and the chin as I remember it.

‘As George was hit, the momentum with which the punch hit him spun him round towards me.

‘I remember seeing his face as he fell to the floor.

‘It looked like the life had been sucked out of him.’

Mr Kane said the trouble began when one of his friends was headbutted by another teenager.

He said a large group ‘swarmed’ up the street as arguments raged between the teenagers, and some started to chase one of his friends up the road.

Mr Verrier was able to walk away from the attack, but was found unconscious at a friend's house the following morning with severe bleeding on his brain, and died just hours later

Mr Kane said he went to protect the friend, and was punched in the face himself, just before Mr Verrier was attacked. 

‘George was standing opposite him, still telling him to calm down’, he said.

‘They were both shouting at each other but George was shouting at Ben to calm down and to leave it.’

He said Hayes landed the punch out of nowhere, then left the scene when a police van called to the earlier disturbances arrived.

‘As soon as Ben Hayes saw the police van, he ran down the road’, he said.

‘I’ve never seen someone running so fast in my life.

‘George Verrier was bleeding from the nose and the mouth.

‘I remember thinking to myself I thought he actually looked dead.’

Hayes was arrested shortly after the attack, in Southborough Street, on September 1 last year.

‘There are no winners in this case’, said Ms Johnson.

‘Both the defendant and the deceased were young men with their whole lives in front of them.’

Hayes argued he was acting in self-defence when he punched Mr Verrier.

Hayes, of Constable Mews, Bromley, denied but was convicted of manslaughter.
