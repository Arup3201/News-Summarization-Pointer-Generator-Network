The last surviving child of legendary Boston Red Sox great and Hall of Famer Ted Williams has spoken publicly for the first time about the controversial decision she and her brother took to have their father cryogenically frozen.

Claudia Williams, the youngest of The Kid’s three children, together with her brother John-Henry were subjected to public ridicule in 2002 when they spent $100,000 to have the baseball legend’s remains sent to a cryonics lab in Arizona.

Their decision also prompted an ugly legal battle with Williams’ oldest daughter, Bobby-Jo Ferrell,  who insisted that her father’s final wishes were to be cremated and his ashes scattered off the Florida Keys.

At the time Bobby-Jo accused her half-siblings of wanting to preserve their father's DNA with the intention of selling it in the future.

In her new book Ted Williams, My Father, Claudia says the decision to move her father's body to the Alcor Life Extension Foundation in Arizona was done out of love.

‘I can tell you that my family chose cryonics out of love,’ writes Claudia about the controversy. ‘Our father knew we needed something to hold onto for hope and comfort and when we missed him the most, and if cryonics was the answer, then the solution was simple.’

She writes that while she and her brother ‘didn’t truly believe at the time’ they sent their father’s body off to a cryonics lab that they would all ‘awake from suspension and be reunited’ they did it because they couldn’t bear the thought of losing him forever, reports the Boston Herald.

‘No one would spend over $100,000 and subject themselves to public outrage and ridicule for someone they don’t dearly love. There was no ill intent or devious plan. ... It (cryonics) was like a religion, something we could have faith in.’

‘It is no different from holding the belief that you might be reunited with your loved ones in heaven,’ writes Claudia.

Born after her father retired from baseball, Claudia grew up with little idea that her dad was one of the most revered sports figures of all time - until she finally saw him in uniform at Fenway Park, receiving the adulation of thousands of fans.

Claudia and brother John-Henry were the children of Williams and his third wife, Dolores Wettach, a former Miss Vermont and a Vogue model.

The couple divorced three years after Claudia was born and the children rarely saw their father until they were young adults.

In her book, Claudia writes that both she and her brother constantly tried to win his attention and affection and she believed she had it worse because she wasn’t a boy. She also describes a bitter relationship with Bobby-Jo.

Ted Williams was 83 when he passed away in July 2002. His head and body are currently being 
stored separately at minus-320 degrees until scientists figure out how 
to bring people back to life.

Claudia’s brother John-Henry died from 
acute leukemia two years after his father's death and his body is also stored at
 Alcor.

In her book, Claudia says that she believes that what they did with their father’s remains should have been a private family matter.

‘I hate that I feel forced to explain why we chose to preserve our family cryonically,’ she writes.

‘Quite frankly, it is no one’s damned business. It is a private family matter... This decision was made by a family who loved and respected each other. It is not a science-fiction film.'

She said she and John Henry never spoke out at the time because of that belief.

‘We were silent when perhaps we should have screamed,’ she writes.

Known as The Kid, Williams is considered the greatest hitter in US baseball history. He won the American League batting championship six times during his 19 seasons with the Red Sox and he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1966.

He also spent four years as manager of the Washington Senators and the Texas Rangers.
