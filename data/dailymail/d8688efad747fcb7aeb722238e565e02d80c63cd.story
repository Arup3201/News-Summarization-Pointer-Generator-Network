A suspected drunk driver traveling the wrong way down a California freeway collided head-on with a car carrying a family-of-four on Sunday, killing two and himself.

Police have identified the driver as 28-year-old Mack Jaramillo of La Habra, who was heading westbound on the eastbound lane of the 210 Freeway in Rancho Cucamonga about 2.20am.

He was pronounced at the scene, according to KTLA.

The two other victims, both female and sitting on the back seat of a silver sedan, were not believed to have been wearing seatbelts and could have been saved if they were, police said.

Friends of Mack Jaramillo have been posting tributes to his Facebook page, saying they are heartbroken

The California Highway Patrol had received reports that a possible drunk driver in a dark-colored Hyundai Elantra was seen in the carpool lane driving at dangerous speeds and swerving.

Sections of the freeway were shut down for several hours following the crash as emergency crews worked to clear the roads.

All lanes were reopened just before 7.30am.
