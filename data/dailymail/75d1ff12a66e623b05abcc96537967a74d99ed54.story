Tina Bayliss had no idea a man she had gone on several dates with was a convicted child killer until he strangled her 13-year-old daughter in the family home.

Jade was gagged and strangled in her Christchurch home in November 2011 by Jeremy McLaughlin - a man with criminal past that no one, not even the police, warned Ms Bayliss about. 

The mother of three was devastated to learn her daughter had been murdered, but she was dealt another cruel blow when she found out Jade's death could have been prevented.

Jade Bayliss, 13, was gagged and strangled to death in her Christchurch home in November 2011 by convicted child killer Jeremy McLaughlin

McLaughlin was sentenced to 23 years in jail in 2013 for Jade's murder, stealing items from her family's home and torching it.

Now, Ms Bayliss is determined to change the system that let her daughter's killer slip through the cracks. 

Ms Bayliss, completely unaware of his dark history, had been on a few dates with McLaughlin in the six weeks prior to Jade's murder.

When she started to distance herself from him, Ms Bayliss said she became concerned when he started stalking her and sending inappropriate text messages.

Four days before Jade's death, Ms Bayliss went to police.

'I asked if I should be worried about Jeremy McLaughlin,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'I was informed that I had nothing to worry about and was given a trespass order to serve to Jeremy if he came to my home. 

'They typed his name in, but to this day I don’t think anything came up on the computer. If they knew and just gave me a trespass order, that’s pretty sick.'

Jade stayed home from school sick on the day she was killed and left to perish in the house fire in 2011

Sadly, the day McLaughlin did return Ms Bayliss wasn't home.

'It still is the worst day of my life,' she said. 

'I had a gut feeling, but when they said suspicious circumstances, I said straight away it was Jeremy.' 

Ms Bayliss was soon informed McLaughlin had been deported to New Zealand after he was found guilty of killing a 14-year-old boy in Western Australia in 1995. 

Phillip Vidot and his friend Tyron Williams had been beaten with a cricket bat, run over and robbed of their clothing. 

McLaughlin was sentenced to 12 years for the manslaughter of Phillip, but only served six before he was deported back to his native country.

Ms Bayliss said if police had known of McLaughlin's criminal history she could have been better equipped to protect her 13-year-old daughter Jade

'I was shell-shocked because I had been into the police station before,' Ms Bayliss said.

'I just kept thinking, if it did come up on the system that he hurt a child, surely they could have provided me with protection. I was pretty devastated.'

Now more than three years on, Ms Bayliss is determined to change the system. 

She has launched an online petition  calling for a register to help monitor criminals deported to New Zealand and Australia after serving time in other countries.

'We all should have the right to protect ourselves and our loved ones from potential harm, especially if the person has served time for committing a serious crime,' she said.

She wants Australia and New Zealand to set up a serious crimes register so that police informed when someone is being deported after serving time.

At the moment there's no such register, only one for sex offenders.

Ms Bayliss is also campaigning for deported criminals to meet the same parole conditions as those who have served time in New Zealand. 

'If this information was available to the police and they could have informed me of McLaughlin's serious criminal history I would of been better equipped to try and protect my family,' she said.

'Things could have been a lot different.'

Ms Bayliss' petition is available on change.org.
