Caught out: Radio presenter Burden has hit out over the BBC's move to Salford

Many BBC staff have never made a secret of their disdain for their new northern base.

But one presenter has taken the sniping to a new level...by making an on-air joke accusing the Corporation’s neighbours in Salford of being light-fingered.

The gaffe came when BBC Five Live breakfast show host Rachel Burden was interviewing Olympic cycling hopeful Laura Trott, who won two gold medals at the Track Cycling World Championships in Melbourne, about her success.

But when Miss Trott, 19, joked about accidentally leaving the medals in her car, Miss Burden quipped: ‘What? Around here?’

The suggestion that the car was at risk of being broken into caused fury among radio listeners in Salford, who help to pay 35-year-old Miss Burden’s wages through the licence fee and say the city is being unfairly reviled as a crime hotspot by BBC staff.

Edward Reid, a legal worker, said of Tuesday’s interview: ‘It’s time presenters like Rachel kept their prejudices to themselves rather than airing them to listeners. She is employed to do a job, not pass snide remarks about an area which she knows little or next to nothing about. Grow up.’

Joanna Smith, 29, a clerical worker, said: ‘It’s just ignorance really. Salford does have a reputation as a hard city but so has London – they need to get a grip.’

Salford MP Hazel Blears said of Salford Quays, where the BBC is based: ‘I go down there on a regular basis and there’s always a lot of activity. It seems like a safe place to be. In any urban environment you get the odd incident.’

This week it emerged that BBC managers have offered staff in Salford personal security guards to escort them to their cars and tram stops from their studios.

However, crime rates for Shepherd’s Bush, home to the BBC’s White City London headquarters, are higher than in Salford, and its figures for violent crime and robbery are way above the national average. Furthermore, recent figures show that although Salford remains slightly above the national average for violence and robbery, crime there has dropped.

The BBC’s move to Media City in Salford Quays – where about 1,600 staff are now based, has been riddled with gaffes and controversy, with many presenters refusing to move. BBC Breakfast presenters Sian Williams and Chris Hollins both refused to make the change and have since been replaced.

Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson blasted the BBC’s move last year, describing Salford as ‘a small suburb with a Starbucks and a canal with ducks on it’ and said that he would resign if the motoring programme was moved north.

Miss Burden, a mother-of-three, last year said she was ‘excited’ by the prospect of a move to the North and a new base in Salford.

But she revealed she and her partner would not be selling their four-bedroom London home in Ealing, valued at £650,000.

‘London prices are likely to rise faster than other parts of the country so we want to hold on to it and let it out,’ she said.

She added that she was looking forward to settling in an upmarket Cheshire village with good schools and an easy commute to Salford.

She said: ‘I was surprised prices in Cheshire aren’t much cheaper for a similar-sized house to our home, although the gardens are larger. It may not be easy to find a home that ticks every box so we are likely to rent first.’

A spokesman for BBC North said: 'During a light-hearted moment at the end of the interview with Laura Trott, an off-the-cuff remark was made. No offence was intended and we’re sorry if anyone was upset.'

Burden's remarks follow reports that a number of staff have been warned over their safety following the move to Salford.

Corporation chiefs have offered personal security guards to escort men and women to their cars and tram stops from the studios.

And an extraordinary email intended to reassure staff about on-site security will serve only to increase fears, with a BBC executive admitting she has been looking at site security ‘following a couple of incidents’.

In a move costing an estimated 
£1.5billion, the BBC has relocated 2,500 staff across five departments 
including Sport, Children’s and Radio 5 Live to the Media City site.

BBC Breakfast made its Salford debut 
on Tuesday, while Blue Peter and Match of the Day are among the 
programmes which air from the futuristic complex.

Fears: The BBC's £200m Media City development in Salford. Staff were told that it was a 'different kettle of fish' from West London

Incidents there over the past year include:

The offer of personal security applies
particularly for those working late at night or early in the morning.

In a leaked email intended to reassure staff about on-site safety, Rhian
Roberts, head of development for Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra, said 
the measures had been tightened after incidents affecting staff.

‘I’ve been looking at on-site security
on 5 Live’s behalf following a couple of incidents – and also the 
reality that Media City is a different kettle of fish to W12.’

The BBC’s buildings at White City have
private car parks manned by security and which require a pass to enter,
while the Tube station is yards away.

By contrast, the Salford Quays area 
has open access as a number of businesses operate in the area and is 
relatively deserted after normal working hours. The site is patrolled by
security guards on foot and on Segway electric two-wheeled vehicles.

In the same email, Tony Chebrika, the 
head of security for Peel Media Group – which owns and polices the site –
said he could ‘arrange for escorts’ for frightened staff. Mr Chebrika 
also reassured staff that the site had 300 CCTV cameras, guards on 
constant patrol and a 24-hour control room.

In spite of these precautions, 
however, a wide range of crimes were reported by BBC employees since 
last year including assault, spray-paint damage and thefts.

Paul Newman, head of communications 
for Peel Media, said that the Salford complex includes more than 50 
commercial businesses – including Costa Coffee, Wagamama and Prezzo – 
and 378 apartments.

He said: ‘From day one our policy has 
been to, on request, offer escorts to people who want to get to their 
cars or the tram stop, particularly late at night.’

The crime rate has dropped in Salford 
in recent years but remains slightly above the national average for 
violent crime and robbery.

Last year a student staying at a hotel in 
Salford Quays was shot dead in what police described as an ‘unprovoked 
attack’.

However, crime rates for the Shepherd’s Bush area around White 
City are higher than Salford and its figures for violent crime and 
robbery are well above the national average.

John Merry, leader of Salford City Council, yesterday pointed out that crime was not unique to the city.

‘This is just scaremongering,’ he 
said. ‘It is not unusual for complexes like MediaCityUK to have high 
levels of security, whether in Salford, London or any other city.’

BBC Breakfast presenters Susanna Reid 
and Bill Turnbull were teased yesterday over their move to Salford.

Shaun Ryder, of the Happy Mondays, said: ‘I only live four minutes away 
... great to have you on in the North.’

When Ryder started asking Turnbull 
where exactly in Cheshire he would be living, the presenter replied: 
‘Careful’, acknowledging that the travel and residential arrangements of
BBC broadcasters in the North are intended to be kept off screen.

Turnbull then joked: ‘All back  to Shaun’s for some breakfast –  he’s closest!’
