For one unfortunate gambler, Saturday's extraordinary round of FA Cup results will be remembered for all the wrong reasons.

The punter had placed a £10 accumulator bet with a bookmaker on five games, with the odds stacked so heavily against them they would have taken £1million had it been successful. 

But as Crystal Palace came from behind to beat Southampton,  Manchester City went down 2-0 to Middlesbrough, Tottenham slipped to a 2-1 defeat against Leicester City and Reading beat Cardiff City 2-1.

The odds of all five results occurring were so high, the gambler was given odds of a 1,000,000/1. Here is how close he came:

BET: Crystal Palace to beat Southampton

RESULT: Crystal Palace 3-2 WIN

BET: Middlesbrough to beat Manchester City

RESULT: Middlesbrough 2-0 WIN

BET: Leicester City to beat Tottenham

RESULT: Leicester 2-1 WIN

BET: Reading to beat Cardiff City 

RESULT: Reading 2-1 WIN

BET: Bolton to beat Liverpool, both sides to score

RESULT: 0-0 LOSS 

Four out of five results had, unbelievably, come in. 

The only game remaining was Saturday's late kick-off at Anfield where Liverpool faced championship side Bolton.

A victory for Neil Lennon's team, with both sides hitting the back of the net, was all that was required for the most astounding of bets to have landed.

And the customer clearly felt their luck was in, as they rejected a £15,000 offer to cash-out before proceedings began at Anfield.

Agonisingly, there was not enough magic left in the cup for Bolton to emerge victorious.

The game finished 0-0, with the unfortunate gambler left stunned at would could have been won.

The bookmakers, meanwhile, breathed an almighty sigh of relief.

But the punter was not left staring at their slip for too long, pondering what they would have spent the money on.

Betfair, the bookies in question, have given the punter four free bets of £1000 for every prediction that was correct while also inviting them to the FA Cup final.
