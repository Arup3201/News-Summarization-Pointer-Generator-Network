A man has died after he was allegedly ran over by his brother following a long-standing and bitter family feud.

Theodore Lavizzo, 57, was backed over by a truck driven by his 46-year-old brother Kelvin on Saturday night in the backyard of his apartment, police said.

He later died from his injuries at University Hospital in Madisonville, Ohio. The brothers had been known to have a long-running feud, neighbors said.

The younger man said he was backing up his pickup truck and didn't realize he had struck his brother. It was yet unclear if alcohol was involved in the incident.Â 

Kelvin Lavizzo has been charged with murder and was being held at the Hamilton County Jail on $1million bond. An initial court appearance was expected on Tuesday.

Last year, the two brothers and their sister had been indicted over a scheme where they allegedly stole $150,000 in welfare benefits.

One neighbor Miles Jones spoke highly of his friend who was a skilled auto-mechanic.

He told Fox 19: 'He was a good guy, a family man. He was real good with cars, he would go out of his way to help you.

'I really didn't think it would happen but I heard it was in the family... I guess it must have been something personal.'
