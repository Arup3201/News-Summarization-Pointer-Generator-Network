Evra arrived for his medical tests at the Fornaca clinic just before 8am ahead of his official unveiling as a Juve player.

Evra said: 'The sensation here at Juve is incredible.I
 start a new adventure. I come from a club like Manchester, where I won 
everything and now I'm here with the Bianconeri where I have done 
nothing yet.

'I am someone who likes to win, I chose a
 team like Juve to win and I will do my best to give all that I can for 
the club, for the fans, for the coach and for my team-mates.'

Evra could yet be followed to Italy by other United players as meetings continue.

Napoli are finding a deal for Marouane Fellaini too expensive at this juncture and have enquired about taking former Portsmouth and Chelsea midfielder Lassana Diarra who is at Lokomotiv Moscow.

Javier Hernandez is also considering all options. He has made a favourable impression on the US tour so far but Atletico Madrid and Inter Milan remain keen.

Inter have agreed the outline of a deal with Southampton for Dani Osvaldo. it would see the South coast club take a huge hit on their initial £12.8million outlay with a loan followed by £7million next summer.

However, they still want another striker and held talks with Hernandez's representatives on Wednesday.
