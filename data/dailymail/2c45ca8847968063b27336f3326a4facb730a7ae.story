Tom Ince has set his sights on signing for a team in the Barclays Premier League after deciding against joining Inter Milan.

The Italian giants met with Ince in San Siro last month and made two contract offers but a deal could not be agreed and the 22-year-old now wants to stay in England.

That will please Blackpool, who stand to receive substantially more than they would have had the former England Under-21 international gone abroad. Monaco were also interested.

Even though Ince is now out of contract his fee should he move to the Premier League will be set by a tribunal as he is under 23, unless an agreement is reached between Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston and the buying club.

Swansea, Stoke, Sunderland, Hull and Newcastle are among the teams to have registered an interest but will want to pay less than the an estimated £8million tribunal figure based on the £1.5m fee Crystal Palace paid Blackpool to take Ince on loan for the second half of last season.

Had Ince moved abroad the compensation to Blackpool would have been just £155,000.

‘I am flattered to have received such strong interest from several big European clubs. But I believe at this early stage of my career I need to continue my football education in England,' Ince said today.

'I would like to thank the clubs overseas for their interest and kindness. I still have ambitions to one day play in Europe.

‘I am now looking forward to what lies ahead next season.’
