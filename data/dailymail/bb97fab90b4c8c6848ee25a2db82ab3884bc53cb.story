Police in Rotherham faced fresh outrage last night after it emerged officers undermined investigations into rape and sexual assault against vulnerable girls.

A damning report revealed a unit which deals with serious sex crimes spent a great deal of time trying to 'disprove the word' of some of the victims.

Officers in South Yorkshire Police's child abuse unit were also 'pressured' by senior colleagues not to record rapes as crimes, it was revealed.

Chief inspector of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary savaged the 'unacceptable' culture within South Yorkshire Police's public protection unit

In a scathing attack on practices within the force at the height of the scandal, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) savaged the 'unacceptable' culture within its public protection unit.

Tom Winsor, the official police watchdog's chief inspector, said: 'This culture of dealing with reports of crime shows a disregard for victims and is unacceptable.'

It also emerged last night that only three part-time police officers were responsible for catching rapists who abused hundreds of vulnerable children at the height of the Rotherham exploitation scandal.

A confidential report by South Yorkshire Police reveals that up to 300 children were being sexually exploited in the county in 2010, with the total number of offences 'in the thousands.'

But during that period there were 'only three officers across the whole force with a permanent responsibility for CSE [child sexual exploitation]'.

One of these officers worked part time and the other two had 'additional portfolios that take up at least half their time'.

At least 1,400 vulnerable children were horrifically abused by rapists – mainly of Asian origin – who escaped justice for 16 years in Rotherham 

The report added: 'Force provision for the policing of child sexual exploitation is not equivalent to the scale and seriousness of the problem.'

It echoes this week's damning dossier into the Rotherham scandal by Professor Alexis Jay, in which she described how 'senior and middle managers were more focused on dealing with offences such as burglary and vehicle crime'.

The revelations heap new shame on South Yorkshire Police just days after the catastrophic scale of child sex abuse in Rotherham was exposed. At least 1,400 vulnerable children were horrifically abused by rapists – mainly of Asian origin – who escaped justice for 16 years.

Police, council chiefs and social services repeatedly turned a blind eye to evidence that the defenceless girls had fallen into the clutches of a group of paedophiles between 1997 and last year.

The officer who was head of South Yorkshire Police between 2004 and 2011 was best known for leading an ultimately embarrassing crusade against speeding motorists.

Chief constable Meredydd Hughes CBE showed little sympathy for those clocked by speed cameras.

He also demanded tougher sentences for hit-and-run motorists and those causing death by dangerous driving.

This was going on a time when scores of young girls were being subjected to sexual exploitation including gang rapes, grooming and trafficking.

His campaign reached a humiliating conclusion when he was caught driving at 90mph in a 60mph zone in 2007.

Mr Hughes was disqualified from driving for 42 days and fined £350, and was left with little option but to step down from his role as chairman of roads policing at the Association of Chief Police Officers, which he had held for two years.

He retired from South Yorkshire Police in 2011, before making a failed bid to be elected as the area’s first police and crime commissioner. He has however been awarded a CBE for his services to policing.

But now campaigners and politicians will want to know whether the focus on speeding motorists was to the detriment of child sex abuse victims in the area his force covered.

Mr Hughes could not be reached for comment last night.

HMIC yesterday published a report criticising South Yorkshire Police for under-recording crime following a 12-month probe from November 2012. Inspectors highlighted the impact this practice had on vulnerable children who had been victims of sexual assault.

Out of 152 incident records, inspectors found that 117 crimes should have been recorded – but 24 per cent of them were not.

South Yorkshire Police was found to have a culture of 'investigate-to-record', where officers do not record incidents as possible crimes until they have been investigated – in contravention of Home Office rules.

HMIC examined 66 violent offences, including rape, that South Yorkshire Police had written off as 'no-crime' but found 11 of these – just under 20 per cent – were wrongly classified and should have been pursued.

The report said: 'This level of under-recorded crime is a significant cause of concern and is a matter of material and urgent importance, particularly as some of these relate to violence and sexual assault against vulnerable children.'

Failure to record crimes properly was 'particularly evident in the public protection unit, with a great deal of time spent trying to disprove the word of the victim from the outset'.

It said: 'We found that where a victim is vulnerable, either through age or mental health issues, and it appears that there is any doubt regarding the authenticity of the report, a no-crime [report] is often submitted.'

Separately, the revelations over the tiny number of officers devoted to grooming came in a confidential 2010 report commissioned by Detective Superintendent Adrian Teague, the South Yorkshire force's director of intelligence and public protection.

By 2013, the child sexual exploitation team at the force had increased to 11 police officers. But in that year they still had to deal with 294 complex abuse cases.

Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP responsible for exposing the paedophile past of Liberal politician Cyril Smith, said: 'Vulnerable children are being fobbed off and not treated seriously.'

Last night it also emerged around a quarter of violent and sexual offences were wrongly written off by the three biggest police forces in England and Wales.

HMIC found 23 per cent of rape, robbery and violence allegations were incorrectly shelved by the Metropolitan Police, 24 per cent by West Midlands Police and almost 29 per cent by Greater Manchester Police.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission warned it may investigate South Yorkshire Police over its failure to properly investigate allegations of major crimes.

But a spokesman for the force defended its record, saying: 'The public protection unit is victim-led and officers take great care to ensure all victims of this type of crime are fully supported throughout an investigation, from the moment a report is received.'
