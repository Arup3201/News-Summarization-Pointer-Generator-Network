New evidence has shown ancient Egyptian embalmers did not always leave the heart in place or remove the guts using cedar oil enemas, as has been believed for thousands of years.

Much of the information about Egyptian mummification comes from Herodotus, a fifth century BC Greek historian.

Herodotus described first and second class levels of embalming. The elite, he said, got a slit through the belly, through which organs were removed.

For the lower classes, he said mummies had organs eaten away with an enema of cedar oil, which was thought to be similar to turpentine.

Herodotus also claimed that the brain was removed during embalming and other accounts suggest that that heart was always left in place.

However, the ancient historical source has been dismissed by researchers.

'A lot of his accounts sound more like tourist stories, so we're reticent to take everything he said at face value,' Andrew Wade, an anthropologist at the University of Western Ontario told LiveScience.

The new research findings, published in the February issue of HOMO - Journal of Comparative Human Biology, came from analysing 150 mummies from the ancient world.

Embalming was a competitive business, and the tricks of the trade were closely guarded secrets, says Wade, the study co-author.

Wade and his colleague Andrew Nelson looked through the literature to see how eviscerations actually took place.

They discovered details on how 150 mummies were embalmed over thousands of years in ancient Egypt. They also conducted CT scans and 3D reconstructions on seven mummies.

One of their key findings was that for upper class Egyptians, evisceration was sometimes performed through a slit in the rear.

In addition, there wasn't much indication that cedar oil enemas were used, as described by Herodotus.

Only 25 per cent had their hearts left in place. The removal of the heart seems to coincide with the transition period when the middle class gained access to mummification, so getting to keep the heart may have become a status symbol after that point, Wade said.

Egyptian pharaohs often ordered jewels and even wives to be placed in tombs, so that they could bring them along on their spiritual journey.

Embalming was the process of drying a body. Internal organs, besides the heart and kidney, were removed, and then the inside of the body was rinsed with wine to kill bacteria.

Salt was added inside the body, to dry it further, and then the corpse was covered with sawdust. Bodies were often painted and massaged to make them supple, then stuffed and perfumed before being placed in a coffin.

Huge fees were charged for making Egyptians immortal, which was of paramount importance to them. It is estimated that some 70 million mummies were created before the practice became extinct.

It is often believed that mummies were ousted by the gradual rise of Christianity in the areas of South America, Egypt and Mexico. According to this religion, mummification was declared pagan.
