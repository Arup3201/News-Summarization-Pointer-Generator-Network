Use of the gallows hasn't taken place in Sri Lanka since 1976, even though there are currently 405 convicts on death row

Sri Lanka is searching for a new hangman after the latest recruit got upset on seeing the gallows for the first time and quit immediately.

The Prisons Department appointed the new hangman, the third most qualified from 176 applicants, last week, months after two hangmen chosen late last year failed to show up for work.

Chandrarathna Pallegama, commissioner general of prisons said: 'We gave him one week's training, but he resigned after seeing the gallows.

'He said that he didn't want the job.

'He told me that after seeing the gallows he got upset.

'Next time, we will show the gallows to the new recruits before giving them basic training.'

According to reports, he wouldn't have been likely to hang anyone anyway as the job is mostly light administrative work only.

The Indian Ocean island nation is a predominantly Buddhist country, and has not carried out an execution since 1976.

Despite this, there are at least 405 convicts who have been sentenced to the death penalty.

However, there has been an alarming rise 
in child abuse, rapes, murders, and drug trafficking in the country 
since the 25 year war against the Tamil Tiger separatists.

Since
 the war ended in 2009, lawyers and politicians have pushed for the 
death penalty to be reintroduced following the dramatic rise in violent 
crimes.

The history of the death penalty in Sri Lanka starts with the British restricted the death penalty after they took control of the island in 1815.

It was limited to murder, and 'waging war against the King'.

But after independence, the then Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike abolished capital punishment in 1956.

But it was very quickly reintroduced after his assassination in 1959.

President Chandrika Kumaratunga has made several attempts to reintroduce the death penalty.

In March 1999, after spurts of violence near the end of her first term in office, she stated that the government would be reintroducing the death penalty but was forced to back down because of public protest.

But on November 19, 2004, a judge, Sarath Ambepitiya, was gunned down as he arrived home from work.

This caused President Kumaratunga to reinstate capital punishment immediately.

Sri Lanka is a nation mostly based around the Buddhist religion, which is one of peace. But despite this, there has been a rise in violent crime causing many politicians and lawyers to call for a renewed use of the death penalty

While there are less countries that use the death penalty than there are that don't, Sri Lanka is by no means the only country to have legal capital punishment.

Of the 195 independent states that are UN members, 51 per cent have abolished the death penalty.

Meanwhile, 4 per cent retain it for crimes committed in exceptional circumstances, such as war.

25 per centÂ  permit its use for ordinary crimes, but have not used it for at least 10 years and are believed to have a policy or established practice of not carrying out executions (such as Sri Lanka), and 20 per cent maintain the death penalty in both law and practice.
