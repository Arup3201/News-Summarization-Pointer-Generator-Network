Newsnight anchorman Jeremy Paxman at the Leveson Inquiry today

Former newspaper editor Piers Morgan was accused yesterday of telling Jeremy Paxman how to hack into a mobile phone.

The BBC presenter said Mr Morgan also teased TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson about private conversations she had with Sven-Göran Eriksson.

He said he was bemused by a conversation during a lunch at the headquarters of the Daily Mirror’s publisher at Canary Wharf in 2002.

Earlier that year the tabloid had revealed that Miss Jonsson had had an affair with the then England football coach.

The claims appear to contradict evidence given by Mr Morgan, now a New York-based talkshow host with CNN, to the Leveson Inquiry last year.

Mr Morgan denied listening to Miss Jonsson’s voicemail messages to uncover the affair and said he did not believe phone hacking took place at the Mirror while he was editor.

Last night he responded to the latest comments via Twitter, saying: ‘Right – that’s the last time I’m inviting Jeremy Paxman to lunch. Ungrateful little wretch.’

Mr Paxman told the inquiry into media standards yesterday that he attended a lunch hosted by Sir Victor Blank, the then chairman of Trinity Mirror, a decade ago.

The Newsnight anchorman was seated beside Mr Morgan with Miss Jonsson, Sir Victor and Sir Philip Green, the Topshop billionaire sitting nearby.

Mr Paxman said: ‘Morgan said, teasing Ulrika, that he knew what had happened in the conversations between her and Sven-Göran Eriksson and he went into this mock Swedish accent.

‘Now, I don’t know whether he was repeating a conversation that he had heard or he was imagining this conversation. In fact, to be fair to him, I think we should accept both possibilities, because he probably was imagining it. It was a rather bad parody.’

BBC journalist Andrew Marr admitted at the Leveson Inquiry yesterday that an interview in which he asked former Prime Minister Gordon Brown if he was taking prescription painkillers was 'not a moment I look back on in my career with enormous enthusiasm or pride'

The veteran presenter said Mr Morgan’s treatment of Miss Jonsson was close to bullying. ‘I didn’t like it,’ he said. Mr Paxman said Mr Morgan then explained to him intricate details of how the phone hacking scam was undertaken.

He added: ‘He turned to me and said, “Have you got a mobile phone?”, I said, “Yes”, and he said, “Have you got a security setting on the message bit of it?”

‘I don’t think it was called voicemail in those days, I didn’t know what he was talking about. He then explained that the way to get access to people’s messages was to go to the factory default setting and press either 0000 or 1234 and that if you didn’t put on your own code, in his words, “you’re a fool”.’

Mr Paxman said: ‘I don’t know whether he was making this up, making up the conversation, but it was clearly something that he was familiar with and I wasn’t. I didn’t know that this went on.’

Last December, Mr Morgan told the Leveson Inquiry that he had little memory of the lunch and denied telling Miss Jonsson to change the PIN on her mobile phone.

Speaking via video link, he said he did not remember ‘the specifics’ and described claims that he had hacked Miss Jonsson’s voicemail as ‘absolute nonsense’. He said he was given a tip-off about the affair in 2002 and said Miss Jonsson’s press agent had confirmed it.

Lord Justice Leveson said a ombudsman with statutory powers to resolve disputes between newspapers and complainants may be needed to ensure effective regulation of the Press

An ombudsman with statutory powers to resolve disputes between newspapers and complainants may be needed to ensure effective regulation of the Press, Lord Justice Leveson said yesterday.

But he insisted that giving legal authority to an independent arbiter would not amount to state control of the Press.

His comments came during exchanges with former Conservative minister Stephen Dorrell at the inquiry into media standards and ethics.

Lord Justice Leveson told Mr Dorrell that new statutes would be needed to make an ombudsman’s decisions legally binding in disputes. 

‘I’ve not said the state should have a view of what is good practice,’ he said. ‘I am not suggesting that the state should have any view on the content.’

But he added that ‘the state should have a view on the mechanisms that are set up’ to regulate the Press.

Mr Dorrell, who as Heritage Secretary between 1994 and 1995 had responsibility for media policy, told the inquiry he was ‘deeply sceptical’ about the need for statutory regulation.

He added that the Government needed to be careful that by introducing legislation ‘you don’t create a cure that’s worse than the disease’.

Mr Dorrell said recent wrongdoing such as phone hacking was a failure of management not of regulation.

He told the inquiry that the Conservatives had decided to ‘do nothing’ with the Calcutt report into Press reforms, which proposed outlawing doorstepping of people in the news by reporters, bugging and long-lens photography. Mr Dorrell said John Major’s government decided that it would not be practical to implement the measures and that there was not a public appetite for the reforms. It much preferred self-regulation.

Mr Dorrell was shown a Daily Mail comment piece from the time which criticised the Tory government’s consideration of privacy legislation and Press regulation.

He said: ‘Government is a political organisation, and I was told early in my political life that any man can have friends but it takes a wise man to have the right enemies. You have to pick which battles you are going to fight.’
