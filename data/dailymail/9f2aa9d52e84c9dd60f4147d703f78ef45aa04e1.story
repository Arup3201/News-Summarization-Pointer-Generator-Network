Sex offender: John Cronin was described as 'incurable' by psychiatrists

One of Britain’s most dangerous sex offenders, who once impersonated a priest to trick his way into a woman’s home and rape her, has returned to live in Scotland.

Police yesterday confirmed that John Cronin, 41, is living at an address believed to be his elderly parents’ home in Tranent, East Lothian, after being released from prison.

Psychiatrists have called him ‘incurable’, while a police source has warned he is likely to strike again.

But the rapist, who was not placed on the Sex Offenders’ Register because it did not exist when he committed his crime, is free from all restrictions and can go wherever he wants.

Police Scotland would not confirm if he was under surveillance, although officers are believed to be aware of his movements.

Cronin has committed more than 50 offences over 25 years, including dishonesty, theft and fraud. He was first jailed for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl.

In 1992 he posed as a priest to get into the Edinburgh home of a female Conservative Party activist, known as Judy X. He subjected her to a brutal sexual assault, and beat her savagely.

But his life sentence was cut to six years on appeal and he served only four years for the horrific crime.

His devastated victim called the sentence ‘an insult’, saying courts had ‘lost sight of the rights of the victim’.

Now locals in Tranent, on hearing Cronin has returned to Scotland for the first time in 17 years, are fearing for their safety.

One grandmother, who did not wish to be named but lives close by, said: ‘I have a padlock on my back gate to keep me safe. I have heard he is back in the area – he has been seen in the street – and I really wish he was not.’

Another neighbour dubbed Cronin a ‘beast’, and locals have been throwing stones at the house where he is staying.

Cronin
is known for pretending to be a priest and for targeting women in 
politics. Shortly after his release for rape, he was caught dressed as a
priest and trying to get into the Irish parliament.

He was jailed again in 1997 for making harassing telephone calls and threats to female politicians.

On his release, between 1998 and 2001, he is believed to have been involved in a number of thefts and frauds.

He has posed as the mayor of Birmingham, and in 2002 was sentenced to two years for an armed bank raid in Waterford, Ireland.

'Beast': Cronin has committed more than 50 offences, including a violent rape, over 25 years

In recent years he has been spotted 
dressed as a priest in Sligo, Galway and Donegal and has tried to con 
women by pretending to be a soldier.

His latest jail term came after he stole £50 from nuns who took him in at a retreat in County Antrim.

He
is now free to roam the country at will, despite psychiatrists 
labelling him ‘one of the most dangerous sexual predators in Britain’.

A
police source said: ‘We will be keeping an eye on him but there are no 
restrictions in place for him so he can do what he likes legally. 
Experience tells us he will reoffend – and soon.’

A man at the address where Cronin is believed to be staying refused to comment.
