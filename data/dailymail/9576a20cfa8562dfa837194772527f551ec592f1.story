The head of the BBC yesterday blamed the deluge of criticism about its ‘faked’ scenes of polar bear cubs on newspaper bitterness over the corporation’s comprehensive coverage of the phone-hacking inquiry.

Director-general Mark Thompson suggested the issue of the misleading Frozen Planet footage was being used as a way of retaliating against the BBC for its reporting of the Leveson inquiry into Press standards.

‘I do rather wonder whether this is really about polar bears or about Lord Leveson and other matters,’ he said.

Faked: Some footage of this woolly caterpillar freezing was not filmed in its natural environment, but in a box instead. It was shown in an episode of Frozen Planet on November 2

Not quite so natural: As the caterpillar gets colder, its breathing stops before finally its gut and blood freeze

Misleading: When the caterpillar thaws again, it scurries off. Some of the footage was doctored for the programme

The BBC filmed deadly spiders in Britain for its documentary Human Planet earlier this year, it has emerged.

The programme showed children hunting Goliath tarantulas in Venezuela for food - but close-ups of the world's largest spiders were filmed in the UK using tame spiders.

During the show this was not explained and it was not mentioned in the 'making of' film at the end either.

The details were located in a PDF called 'Human Planet Filming Techniques' on the programme's website, the Mirror said.

A BBC spokesman said 'we only ever use footage filmed in controlled conditions in extreme circumstances - for example when it's too dangerous'.

Mr Thompson also said viewers had 
already effectively given it the go-ahead to fake scenes in natural 
history shows without telling them.

Millions thought the scene had been captured by BBC cameramen inside an 
underground cave in the sub-zero temperatures of the Arctic wilderness.

But the footage, narrated by Sir David Attenborough, and interspersed 
with real shots of the Arctic, was in fact filmed in a den made of 
plaster and wood in a wildlife enclosure at a Dutch zoo.

Appearing 
before MPs yesterday to answer questions over the BBC’s annual report, 
Mr Thompson played down the controversy about the footage in the Winter 
episode of the hit wildlife series.

The director-general said the BBC would not be re-editing the show’s 
commentary, adding that the corporation had done audience research and 
that viewers were fine with the practice.

He told MPs on the Commons culture, media and sport committee: ‘Some 
years ago we asked the public the specific question of whether they 
would prefer it if there were on-air mentions, either captions or 
labels, and the overwhelming response of the public is they did not want
us to do that.

‘They were quite happy with the idea of us simply explaining where we 
can after the programme, always on the website, how we do it, so those 
who want to know how it is made can find out.’

Preparing for the new arrivals: The fake nest being built in a Dutch zoo, ahead of the birth of the polar bear cubs

Not as it seems: The 'den' in the wildlife park was constructed out of plaster and wood, built below the zoo's polar bear enclosure. It was fitted with cameras shortly before the birth

He claimed it had ‘talked to the public’ and ‘sought their advice’ and 
that they ‘understand’, provided the commentary is ‘written extremely 
carefully’ and was ‘generic’.

But Tory MP Therese Coffey said she was 
one of those that ‘did believe that the extraordinary coverage of the 
polar bears was genuine’.

She said the BBC had ‘spoilt’ the ‘fantastic’ 
programme, adding:

‘For me I will probably never look at a BBC nature 
programme in the same way, [but instead] to see, was it trick cameras.’

Mr Thompson then turned his fire on newspaper coverage of the issue.

He said: ‘All I would say is there is a leader in today’s Mirror that is
quite interesting – “The national broadcaster is quick on the draw when
it comes to pointing fingers at others.

Perhaps when it comes to their 
own editorial standards and ethics a little more action and a little 
less pontificating would be handy”.

‘I do rather wonder whether this is really about polar bears or about Lord Leveson and other matters.’

Faked? What the viewers saw on Frozen Planet turned out not to be filmed in the wild, but in a Netherlands zoo

Mixed: The scene was mixed with real footage of polar bears in the wild, which may have misled viewers

Panorama: The BBC apologised in June after it was found ‘likely’ that Panorama had faked scenes of boys said to be working in an Indian sweatshop. 

Blue Peter: BBC fined £50,000 in June 2007 after a young studio guest posed as a caller when the telephone system failed during a 2006 phone-in. 

Children in Need: A fictitious winner’s details were broadcast during Children in Need on BBC1 Scotland in November 2005 after no calls came through from the public. 

A Year With The Queen: BBC apologised to the Queen in 2007 after a trailer wrongly implied that she had stormed out of a sitting with photographer Annie Leibovitz. 

The Liz Kershaw Show: BBC6 Music found to have repeatedly faked competitions where no prizes existed and that callers had been members of the production team or their friends.

BBC chairman Lord Patten told the committee the fakery had probably only
come to light as a result of an item on the show’s website which 
explained how the images were achieved.

Sir David, 85, has also defended the methods used by Frozen Planet. He 
said: ‘If you had tried to put a camera in the wild in a polar bear den,
she would either have killed the cub or the cameraman.’

Mr Thompson and Lord Patten also faced a call from Labour MP Jim 
Sheridan to sack Jeremy Clarkson over his comments on the One Show about
striking public sector workers being shot.

Lord Patten said the Top 
Gear presenter and the One Show had apologised for the remarks.

Mr Thompson said: ‘I don’t intend to sack him because in my view the remarks were clearly intended as a joke.’

Conservative MP Philip Davies attacked the BBC’s coverage of Europe, 
saying he had seen research which showed that a minuscule percentage of 
guests on news programmes were from a point of view that the UK should 
withdraw from the European project.

Mr Thompson replied that voices of scepticism could be heard ‘morning, noon and night’ across the BBC’s network.'

The documentary drew in eight million viewers transfixed by moving scenes of a polar cub being born

This is not the first time Sir David Attenborough has been accused of misleading viewers in his wildlife documentaries.

In 1997, in the most memorable scene of Polar Bear, Arctic Warrior,
a mother bear was filmed giving birth to and snuggling with her newborn
cub. Viewers were led to believe the scene took place in the Arctic. In
fact, it was filmed in a zoo in Frankfurt, Germany.

In 2001,
Sir David was accused of using deceptive techniques in Blue Planet when
it included a lobster spawning scene that was filmed in a British 
aquarium. Viewers were led to believe the scene was taking place off the
coast of Nova Scotia.

And in 2008, Sir David was accused of 
staging a confrontation between himself and a cobra in a South African 
desert for the series, Life in Cold Blood.
