The discovery of Tutankhamun’s tomb almost a century ago threw up some serious questions and mysteries surrounding the young pharoah’s burial.

Among the most bizarre rituals found in the tomb was that the king’s penis was embalmed at a 90-degree angle – the only mummy to have ever been found with this feature.

Egyptologists from the American University in Cairo have now claimed that this may have been carried out on purpose to make the king appear like Osiris, the god of the underworld, in an attempt to frighten religious revolutionaries.

Researchers from the American University in Cairo believe the appendage was embalmed at a 90-degree angle to make the young pharaoh appear as Osiris, the god of the underworld.

The angling of the penis was a feature worn by 'corn-mummies' that were created in honour of Osiris.

The mummy was also covered in black liquid to resemble Osiris' skin.

Elsewhere, Tutankhamun's heart was missing when the tomb was discovered by Howard Carter in 1922.

Religious texts claimed Osiris' heart was similarly removed by his brother Seth.

On the outside of the tomb, decorations depicted Tutankhamun as Osiris.

At the time of his death in 1323 BC, the father of the teenage Egyptian king was said to be leading a religious revolution in the country.

It is believed Akhenaten wanted to destroy the belief in the Egyptian gods and instead worship a sun disc called the Aten. 

Tutanhkhamun was trying to tackle this revolution when he was believed to have broken his leg and died from an infection in the wound. DNA analysis in 2010 also found traces of malaria in his system.

During mummification a decision was made to not only embalm the erect penis, but also to cover the king’s body in black liquid - similar in colour to the skin of Osiris - and remove his heart.

There was also no sign of a heart scarab, an amulet placed on dead bodies to demonstrate their ‘worthiness’ to travel to the afterlife and for resurrection.

Religious texts claimed Osiris’ heart was removed by his brother Seth and buried separately.

These three rituals, according to Professor Salima Ikram from the university, were done in order to make people think Tutankhamun was the underworld god.

Ikram’s claims are also bolstered by the 
fact unique decorations on the tomb showed the king as the god Osiris 
himself, while other tombs in the area showed the king being embraced by 
Osiris.  

‘The erect penis evokes Osiris at his 
most powerfully regenerative moment, and is a feature of 'corn-mummies,'
 the quintessential symbols of rebirth and resurrection created in 
honour to Osiris,’ explained Ikran in her scientific paper.

On the outside of the tomb, decorations depicted Tutankhamun as Osiris, while wall paintings, pictured, showed the king being embraced by the underworld god. It is believed that if Tutankhamun was shown to be this powerful god it would quash a religious revolution taking place in the 1320s BC

Funerary treasure was found in his tomb, pictured, including an 24.2lb solid gold death mask. However, the traditional heart scarab, used to show a body's worthiness for the afterlife, was missing. Religious texts claimed Osiris' heart was similarly removed by his brother Seth

Tutankhamun, who became pharaoh at the age of 10 in 1333 B.C, ruled for just nine years until his death.

He was the last of the royal line from the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom, one of the most powerful royal houses of ancient Egypt.

The king was succeeded by the high priest Ay for four years, who married Tutankhamun's widow Ankhesenpamon.

Ay was followed by the military leader Horemheb who ruled for 26 years until he ceded power to Ramses, founder of the 19th dynasty.

Stunning funerary treasure was found in his tomb, including an 24.2lb solid gold death mask encrusted with lapis lazuli and semi-precious stones.
