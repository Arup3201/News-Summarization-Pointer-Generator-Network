Disney's hit animated movie Frozen has topped yet another popularity chart, this time for the year's most-requested karaoke song.

Let It Go, arguably the best-known track from the film, has been named as 2014's most popular song in a poll of karaoke crooners.  

Two different versions of the song, recorded by Idina Menzel and Demi Lovato, feature in the movie which earlier this year was named as the highest-grossing animated film of all time, taking close to $1 billion at the box office worldwide.

Let It Go from the hit Disney film Frozen was the year's most popular karaoke song

Indeed, the movie's popularity has already seen it named as the year's best-selling DVD and album by Amazon, while a variety of other Frozen-themed merchandise, from toothbrushes and nail polish to dolls and umbrellas, sold out in stores around the world 

Surprisingly, while both versions of the movie's title track have proved popular, neither have experienced the same global success as some of the film's other releases. 

Former X Factor judge Demi's version was released as a single but only reached number 38 in the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, while failing to even make it into the UK Top 40.

Idina Menzel's version climbed slightly higher, peaking at number 5 in the Billboard Hot 100, and reaching number 11 in the UK.

However, the song accounted for 15 per cent of the 3.5 million songs sung this year by users of UK-based karaoke company Lucky Voice Online Karaoke, well ahead of its nearest rival which was Happy by Pharrell Williams.

1. Let It Go - Idina Menzel/Demi Lovato (15%)

2. Happy - Pharrell Williams (5%)

3. Roar - Katy Perry - (4%)

4. Someone Like You - Adele (3.3%)

5. Rather Be - Clean Bandit (3.1%)

6. Make You Feel My Love - Adele (3%)

7. Summer Nights - John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John from Grease (2%)

8. Don't Stop Believin' - Journey (1.9%)

9. Livin' On A Prayer - Bon Jovi (1.6%)

10. Jolene - Dolly Parton (0.4%)

Other popular choices featured in the top 10 list include Roar by Katy Perry at number three, and Someone Like you and Make You Feel My Love by Adele, which placed fourth and sixth respectively.

According to the karaoke company's managing director, Nick Thistleton, no other karaoke song in history has ever experienced the same kind of success as Let It Go. 

'We've never seen a song dominate like this - even the likes of Adele and Katy Perry don't come close to the popularity of Let It Go,' he said.

'Not only this, but we've seen a whole host of new Lucky Voice Online Karaoke customers as a result of adding this song. 

'Let it Go might have failed to set the singles charts alight, but it's a clear winner as far as karaoke-loving Brits are concerned.'
