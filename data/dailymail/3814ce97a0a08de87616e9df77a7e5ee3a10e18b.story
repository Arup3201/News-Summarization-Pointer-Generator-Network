Hull City will lead the chase to sign Darren Fletcher if the Scotland midfielder decides to leave Manchester United in January.

Fletcher has become an increasingly peripheral figure at Old Trafford since he was appointed vice-captain by Louis van Gaal in the summer and started United’s first three games of the season. The 30-year-old has played less than half an hour of club football as a substitute since August, including a late appearance off he bench in last weekend’s win at Arsenal.

Fletcher, who has salvaged his career after recovering from a chronic bowel condition, is out of contract in the summer and still hopes that he will be offered a one-year extension.

Scottish midfielder Darren Fletcher could be set for a January move away from Manchester United

But the Scot accepts that first-team opportunities will be limited following the summer signings of Ander Herrera and Daley Blind, and he may have to leave Old Trafford where he has won five Premier League titles and the Champions League in a United career spanning 336 games.

Hull boss Steve Bruce is a long-time admirer of Fletcher and it is understood the Premier League strugglers have already registered their interest in taking him to the KC Stadium in the January transfer window.

However, Hull are likely to face competition from a number of other top-flight clubs if Fletcher decides to end his career away from United.

Fletcher is out of contract at the end of the season and has made just three Premier League starts so far
