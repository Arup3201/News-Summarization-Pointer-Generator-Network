Phil Parkinson believes Bradford City can beat any of their FA Cup rivals at Valley Parade – including Manchester United.

The Bantams boss wants Louis van Gaal's men in the quarter-final, should they get past Preston on Monday.

And after disposing of Sunderland during Sunday's 2-0 victory to move into the last eight for the first time in 39 years, Parkinson says Bradford can again upset the odds and land a trip to Wembley in the semi-final.

Phil Parkinson believes his Bradford City side can defeat anybody in the FA Cup at Valley Parade 

'If we get our approach right we have a chance against anyone,' he said.

'We would love Man United. The chairman will want to be away at a big Premier League club, but I want to be at home.

'Here, we can beat anyone if we keep the honesty and do the right things, play as a team. It is about individuals looking good in a team unit with no egos and then getting the rewards.

'The excitement will intensify now in the next round because we are one game from Wembley. We will give it everything, try to attack at every chance and walk off with our heads held high.' Parkinson's heroes were deserving of their triumph against a sorry Sunderland, whose fans turned on manager Gus Poyet.

Goals from Billy Clarke and former Black Cat Jon Stead sealed the win, which was overlooked by both BBC and BT Sport for live coverage.

And Parkinson reflected: 'We played with commitment. They pull on the shirt with pride and play every game giving it everything we have got.

'We started really quick and we were physical in terms of closing down and challenging. We set out to make it uncomfortable. We played with that underdog mentality and maybe we did catch them by surprise.' 

He added: 'We were disappointed it wasn't on TV. The finances of it - a quarter of a million pounds - would have meant a lot. We had to take it on the chin and put in a performance and that is what we have done.' 

Parkinson, meanwhile, was thrilled for striker Stead, who scored just twice during an 18-month spell at Sunderland and was mocked by supporters.

'He has scored in every round for us now and has been immense for us all season,' he said.

'It didn't work out for him at Sunderland but has moved on and is pushing on again in his career, which is great for a player who is 31, credit to him.' 

For Poyet, the sight of away fans fighting among themselves should be a concern.

They chanted: 'Gustavo Poyet, it's always our fault' in reference to some of his recent comments.

And the Uruguayan said: 'I have no problems (with the angry chants from Sunderland fans), I get on with my life. It is normal, I am responsible.

'I have no issue with the fans. I never hide and at the end of the day I am the one who will pay the price because the one who can get sacked is me.' 

He went on: 'We tried our best and there are no regrets. Everyone gave their best under the circumstances. It was a great cup tie. Full stadium, two great sets of fans, fights, elbows, cuts, bad decision from the ref, we had it all.

'It was a proper old style cup tie with two teams committed. 'Credit to Bradford, they know how to play these games. It is not humiliating, it is what the cup brings into the equation. If the top teams always beat the smaller teams, then the cup would not exist.'
