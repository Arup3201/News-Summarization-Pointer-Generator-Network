Brendan Rodgers has the opportunity to mark his 100th Premier League game as Liverpool manager by consigning local rivals Everton to defeat in the Merseyside derby on Saturday.

Out of Liverpool's seven managers in the Premier League era, the Northern Irishman has a win percentage of 53.54%, second only to Rafael Benitez who marginally edges him with 55.26%.

And despite his tenure at Liverpool being a trophyless one so far, Rodgers can reflect on the milestone with pride at the improvement the club have made under his stewardship.

Gerard Houllier won 50% of his Liverpool games, the third most successful manage in the Premier League era

He almost led Liverpool to their first Premier League title last season as his side won an incredible 11 games straight and finished second.

Benitez is Liverpool's most successful manager, winning 126 out of the 228 matches he oversaw as Liverpool boss. 

Gerard Houllier, Benitez's predecessor, won exactly 50% of his games while Roy Evans, Liverpool manager from 1994-1998, is fourth as he was successful in 47.28% of his games.

Kenny Dalglish, the man Rodgers replaced as Liverpool boss, won 42.86% of his games.

Graeme Souness, who was a team-mate of Dalglish's as a Liverpool player, won 41.18% when he was manager from 1991-1994.

Roy Evans won 47.28% of his games in a four-year reign as Liverpool manager from 1994-1998

Roy Hodgson has the lowest, winning 7 out of 20 matches in a five-month reign at Liverpool

Souness' record is still better than the ill-fated spell of Roy Hodgson. The England manager won a miserly 35% of his 20 games and lasted only five months.

Rodgers' side take on Everton at Goodison Park in Saturday's late kick-off as Liverpool look to continue their resurgence and try to move into the top four of the Premier League.
