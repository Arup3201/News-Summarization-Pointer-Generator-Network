An orphaned kitten thinks she is a dog after being brought up by an Irish Wolfhound.

Roomba, a tiny 13 week-old stray, was found abandoned in a ditch when she was just three days old after her mother was run over and killed by a car.

She was taken in by Annie Georgeson, of Dibden, near Southampton, Hampshire, and the first thing she saw when she opened her eyes was Aoife the wolfhound.

Little Roomba thinks she is a dog after being brought up by Aoife the Irish Wolfhound (both pictured) - and the pair love nothing more than to play, snuggle up and groom one another

When Roomba first opened her eyes she saw Aoife - which may be another reason she thinks she is a dog

Roomba, named after a brand of automatic vacuum cleaner which changes direction when it hits a wall, now follows Aoife everywhere and loves snuggling up to her surrogate mother.

Retired Ms Georgeson says little Roomba, who has sight problems, quickly became firm friends with her two wolfhounds, six year old Aiofe and male Ohno, three.

She said: 'She does all sorts of funny things like crawl in between the wolfhounds and you will just see a bit of cat poking out.'

Roomba also rolls over with the dogs when they do and loves being with them. 

Irish Wolfhound Aoife 'usually wants to eat cats' but has taken an 'extraordinary' liking to kitten Roomba

Roomba runs to the door to greet people, eats  out of the dog's bowl and even rolls over when Aoife rolls over

Roomba's vulnerability appears to have awoken Aoife's maternal instincts and the pair are now inseparable 

Sarah Mills, manager at All Animal Rescue, which first took Roomba in when she was found, said: 'It's a very, very unusual situation.

'Annie fosters animals for us and Aiofe usually wants to eat cats, but she's taken an extraordinary liking to Roomba.

'Even Ohno will put up with anything from Roomba.

'It seems like her vulnerability has brought out an amazing maternal instinct in the dogs and they treat her like own of their own.

'Aiofe grooms Roomba and cleans her and Roomba does the same back to Aiofe.

Roomba, who has sight problems, is in need of a permanent home - and she absolutely loves dogs

'Now Roomba is becoming more and more dog like. She runs to the door to greet people with the dogs, she eats the same food at the same time out of the same bowl and she follows the same routine.

'The first thing she saw when she opened her eyes was this Irish wolfhound so I guess she thinks she's a dog. She loves being around them.'

Miss Milles, 31, added: 'By rights she should have died but she's a fighter and obviously thought "I will beat this."

'She's a little trooper and has fought tooth and nail to survive.

'She's a superstar and just loves the dogs.'

Roomba is looking for a permanent home and, although she loves dogs, is scared of children, probably due to her vision problems. She would need a quiet and calm home to live in.

The other two cats from the same litter as her have already been homed.
