Gazing at myself in the changing room mirror, I was lost for words. I’d just wriggled into the dress of my dreams. But looking back at me was something that resembled the Michelin man.

I didn’t just have a visible panty line, but I could practically read the wash-care label. After two children, I expect a smidge of mum-tum. But, in this dress, I looked at least three months gone.

I had little pouches of flab poking out from under each armpit, and my bust, which I normally consider one of my best features, seemed to have morphed into a solid bolster of flesh. I wasn’t just mortified, I was desperately disappointed.

After two children, Claire expects a smidge of mum-tum. But, in this dress, she felt she looked at least three months gone

Ever since Victoria Beckham started designing clothes, I’ve longed to own one of her dresses.

I would have killed for that long, simple, stone-coloured gown she wore to the Vanity Fair Oscars party in 2012. I was even quietly fond of the billowy, pale-blue tent dress she unveiled last year. And I loved her sleek collection, unveiled at New York Fashion Week.

So, as you might expect, I was one of the first through the doors of her London store when it opened last week, edging past the paparazzi and the gang in high-viz jackets (who were not, as I’d assumed from the other end of the street, a group of cutting-edge fashionistas, but merely the builders who had yet to finish).

I’d taken the precaution of dressing in homage to VB herself: a white shirt, buttoned up the way she does it, skinny trousers, my most impenetrable sunglasses and a designer handbag. I didn’t want to be escorted off the premises for looking too scruffy.

But I needn’t have worried. Victoria had declared her shop would be a welcoming place.

‘I think we’ve all been into stores where we’ve been made to feel like we shouldn’t really be there,’ she said. ‘I don’t want people to feel frightened, or scared to come in.’

And, indeed, the intimidating-looking bouncer guarding the door flashed me a friendly smile as I stepped in.

The place was teeming with an eclectic mix of customers: students in ripped jeans, Instagramming everything in sight; middle-aged women, browsing with bemused husbands in tow; Essex girls, clutching armfuls of handbags and swigging heartily on the glasses of free champagne.

There’s nothing so vulgar as a cash till in the store — VB having decreed them ‘ugly’ — so, instead, wherever you are, you hand over your card to an assistant, who swipes it through a little machine.

Tragically, I’d missed Dishy David himself, but Amy Childs, the former Towie star, was there, examining the sunglasses. Clearly, VB’s dream of a shop that could be all things to all people had come off.

I was almost salivating as I strode up the polished steps (thank goodness flat shoes are in this season) to the first floor, in search of the perfect frock.

On the pin-thin models in Victoria’s catwalk show, projected on to a giant screen at the top of the stairs, everything looked irresistible.

Upstairs, the ready-to-wear collection was a comparative oasis of calm, scented deliciously with Diptyque’s Feu de Bois candles. Accepting a glass of fizzy, I settled down on a walnut bench and surveyed the clothes. They hung on individual gold chains, rather than rails, and I flicked through them with care.

The prices were sky-high — from £900 to £3,000 for evening dresses, with one gown at £5,800. The shapes were classic Victoria: slim and pared-down, in red, navy, black and white.

There were perfect little knits, sequinned skirts and gorgeous, A-line frocks with graphic patterns. I was in sartorial heaven. Then, I saw it smiling at me: the party dress I had been longing for.

It was a simple, clingy, black dress in a mix of silk, wool and viscose, with VB’s familiar, full-length zip down the back and silky contrast on the shoulders.

It looked as though it had been made for me.

It cost an eye-watering £1,625. But, I reasoned, such a classic shape would never go out of fashion and it would be supremely flattering. There was just one slight problem: there were only two of these dresses on the shop floor — one in a size eight, the other in a ten.

I’m a size 14, although in some shops I can get away with a 12 on my bottom half. Would a fashion designer famed for her bird-like frame even bother dressing a woman like me? Now, surely, was the moment I would be politely asked to leave and never darken her dainty doors again. I took the plunge and turned to the assistant who, like all the staff I saw, was tiny and perfectly formed.

Perhaps that’s no surprise, since VB reportedly picked them herself, but it was starting to make me feel like Gulliver in Lilliput.

An assistant escorted me to one of the huge changing rooms and came back with three different size 14 frocks.

‘Would you like heels to try them on with?’ he offered. ‘Oh yes, please!’ I said. ‘I’m a size eight.’ His face fell. ‘I think we only go up to a size seven, but I’ll go and look.’

Although the store's opening saw fans queuing outside, Claire says the sky high prices are inaccessible for the average clothes shopper

The instant he’d gone, I reverently slipped the first dress from its padded hanger and stepped into it. This glorious garment, I just knew, was going to skim over my lumps and bumps, while holding me in in all the right places.

Unfortunately, the dress had other ideas. In fact, I had a bit of a problem even getting the zip done up.

And when I looked at myself in the mirror, I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. I had hoped to look like Holly Golightly, but before my horrified gaze stood something that looked like an exploding bin bag.

When the assistant came back with the bad news that even my feet were too big for this shop, I asked, in a whisper, whether he had the dress in a size 16.

To his eternal credit, he didn’t sneer, or even raise a groomed eyebrow. He simply explained, politely: ‘We’re working on it.’ And perhaps he was even telling the truth.

But, as I slunk back down the stairs, feeling fatter than ever, those runway models seemed to be gazing accusingly at my wobbly behind.

Following in the teetering heels of Amy Childs, I made my way past the sliding, concrete door. A reporter rushed up to me, keen to hear my first impressions of the shop.

But I was in no mood to chat. Frankly, I just wanted to be left alone — with a packet of Weight Watchers biscuits.

I still love VB’s clothes. But I will not be back in her beautiful shop until I’ve dropped a couple of dress sizes.
