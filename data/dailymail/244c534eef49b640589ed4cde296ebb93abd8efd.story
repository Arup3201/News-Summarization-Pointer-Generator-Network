Less than 72 hours after retaining his UFC light-heavyweight title, Jon Jones checked himself into a treatment centre having tested positive for cocaine.

The failed test, which took place a month before his fight with Daniel Cormier in Las Vegas, will have no impact on his status as champion.

Cormier was quick to come out in support of his opponent, as was UFC president Dana White along with new sponsor Reebok.

But there was a mixed reaction from his fellow fighters who immediately took to Twitter.
