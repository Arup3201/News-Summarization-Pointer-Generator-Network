Juan Mata says Manchester United need to be more disciplined if they are to challenge in the Premier League this season.

Louis van Gaal's side fell to their third league defeat of the season at Manchester City on Sunday after defender Chris Smalling was sent off.

The manager branded Smalling 'stupid' after he collected a soft booking for needlessly blocking a clearance by City goalkeeper Joe Hart after 31 minutes of the derby and the defender was shown a second yellow by Michael Oliver eight minutes later for a lunge at James Milner.

Juan Mata has called on Manchester United to show more discipline following their derby defeat to City

Smalling received a second yellow card for this lunge on City's James Milner 

Smalling is the third United player to see red this season after Tyler Blackett was dismissed at Leicester and Wayne Rooney went in the home match with West Ham.

Mata, who was an unused substitute in the match, wrote on his blog: 'Playing away against City is always challenging because they have a big offensive potential, as it was shown, but having one player sent off in the first half just makes things more complicated.

'This is the fifth [it is actually third] time this season that one of us gets a red card, so unfortunately we already know what it means to have one player less.

'But even if Aguero scored and we were just 10, our team showed pride and almost tied the game, although this time it was not possible.

'To be honest, right now, rather than looking at the table we have to focus on our path in order to improve and to win games.'

The defender had been booked minutes earlier for charging down a Joe Hart goal kick

Sergio Aguero won the contest for City on 63 minutes with his 12th goal of the season

United manager Louis van Gaal described Smalling's dismissal as 'stupid' 

Mata added that the defeat was 'hard to accept' and that the 'whole team is very upset.'

The defeat, United's fourth in succession against their rivals, leaves them 10th in the table with their lowest points return since 1986, the year Alex Ferguson took over.

Mata added: 'Obviously this situation is not what we wanted, but in this moment the team must stick together and keep on going. I'm sure we will do it.'

In addition to the three reds, United have also racked up 19 yellow cards in their Premier League games so far.

They face Crystal Palace at Old Trafford on Saturday in their next match.
