Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge took him out from his rehab with a leisurely walk in the countryside on Thursday.

The England ace hasn't featured since the beginning of September after getting crocked on international duty.

Sturridge returned to full training last week, only to suffer a calf strain. Reds boss Brendan Rodgers is refusing to put an exact timescale on the forward's latest setback, but he is likely to be missing for at least another couple of weeks.

However, the 25-year-old was out and about this week and posted a picture of himself dressed from head to toe in black - just before Halloween.

Sturridge is desperate to return to action as soon as possible and said: 'On the road to recovery. Can't wait to be back playing. Long walk in the countryside.'

Liverpool have struggled without the striker, whose injury was a massive blow after the departure of Luis Suarez.

Mario Balotelli and Rickie Lambert have both struggled and Rodgers admits Liverpool need to find a way to win without Suarez and Sturridge.

He said:Â 'Anyone will recognise that if you take out of our team the goal threat that we had last year, then you're removing a huge percentage of that efficiency.

'But for us it's about finding a different way to get the same result, which is to win games. It's not been as fluent or as effective, but we're working hard to master that.'
