Sleepless nights are the bane of every new parent’s life.

But one weary father has not only helped stop them – he’s making £60,000 a year in the process.

Matthew Nifield, 33, invented a phone app to send his twin daughters to sleep after he found certain sounds made them nod off.

The computer whizz created the White Noise Ambience app for iPads and iPhones and it is has been downloaded by exhausted parents all over the world. It has proved so popular he's now making £60,000 a year.

The 33-year-old was having sleepless nights because one-year-old daughters Madeleine and Gwyneth would rarely fall asleep together.

But he noticed that some relaxing sounds would start them yawning and they would soon doze off.

Matthew started recording the gentle sounds of waves crashing, 
rain falling onto a car roof and even a cat purring.

And whenever the twins were wide awake he would play one of the sounds to send them off.

Matthew said: 'I looked on the iPhone app store for something to help them doze off but couldn’t find anything. So I created my own app called White Noise Ambience.

'It worked for my girls and now the app is available online - lots of tired parents are downloading it.'

Matthew, of Cardiff, South Wales, recorded 150 different sounds and 
tried them out on his little girls, who were just six months old at the 
time.

He said: 'The girls’ favourite is waves crashing, there is something very peaceful about that.

'But personally I like rain on a car - I normally drop off myself within about 10 minutes of that.'

Other
sounds on the app are, a steam train, frogs croaking in a rainforest, 
and even the sounds of a sprinkler, tumble drier and lawnmower.

The app is so popular in America that Matthew is now living in California where he is designing other internet products.

He said: 'It is earning me around £5,000-a-month.

'There’s quite a considerable living to be earned from apps, especially one that involves a necessity like sleep!'
