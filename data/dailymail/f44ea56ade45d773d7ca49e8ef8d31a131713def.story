During her treatment, Mrs Gibson was given Herceptin, which caused her some heart problems, but this was not ruled as her cause of death

A mother-of-three who battled breast cancer died suddenly at just weeks after finishing treatment - depsite being of the disease.

Kay Gibson, 53, was found dead in bed on October 19 last year by her husband, Alastair, at their home in Bolton, Greater Manchester.

A post mortem examination foundÂ  there were no obvious signs of the cause of her death.

An inquest heard that Mrs Gibson, a pharmacist, had been battling breast cancer after being diagnosed with the disease in December, 2010.

But a post mortem examination found there was no cancer present when she died.

She had a mastectomy in January 2011, which was followed by chemotherapy and then Herceptin treatment.

The inquest was told that she started the Herceptin treatment in September, 2011, and had 17 injections at three-week intervals.

During the treatment, she suffered some heart problems, a side effect of the drug, and was given further medication so she could continue taking the drug.

She had her last session on September 26 last year and was given a follow-up appointment for January.

Dr Patrick Waugh, who carried out the post mortem examination, said there were no obvious signs of the cause of her death.

There was no naturally occurring disease, alcohol or drugs.

He
said: 'There is the issue of Herceptin, with it being cardiotoxic 
[where it damages the heart muscle so it can't pump blood through the 
body as well].

'Normally the problems are with people who have underlying heart disease, which she did not have.'

Herceptin can cause heart problems, but this is only usually in people who already have heart disease

He said it could have been caused by a sudden arrhythmia of the heart, which is the most usual cause of death when there are no observable signs.

He added: 'It is possible but I cannot say 51 per cent that Herceptin was involved.'

Coroner Jennifer Leeming said there were two possible causes but no probable cause, so recorded an open verdict.

Mr Gibson, also a pharmacist, met his wife through work and they married in 1987.

He said: 'She wanted every treatment possible to get rid of it and give herself the best chance.

'She was quite tired at times but was determined to get through the course.'

On the evening before her death she had been sick and could not face eating.

The next day Mr Gibson got up at about 6am and was getting ready for work when his alarm went off at 6.40am while he was in the bathroom.

He shouted through to her to turn it off, but when he went in to check on her he realised she was dead.

The family declined to comment after the inquest.
