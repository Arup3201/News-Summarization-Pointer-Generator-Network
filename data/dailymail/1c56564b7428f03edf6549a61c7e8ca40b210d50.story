A dentist made a cast of Jimmy Savile's teeth to check against the bite-marks found on the bodies of the Yorkshire Ripper's victims, it has emerged.

It is now clear that detectives went to some lengths to find out if Savile was connected to the shocking serial killing spree in the 1970s.

His teeth were examined in 1980, a year before Peter Sutcliffe, now 66, was convicted of murdering 13 women and attempting to kill seven others.

'Mates': Peter Sutcliffe named Jimmy Savile in police interviews, left one of his victims' bodies near the DJ's home and was regularly visited by him while in Broadmoor

Close: The BBC star's home is very near to where Sutcliffe dumped one of his victims - as the Ripper mentioned in a police interview

Two prostitutes thought to have been killed by Sutcliffe had bites on their breasts.

He denied killing one of them, but detectives at the time thought he was lying to cover for an accomplice.

Two of the Ripper's victims were found near Savile's home in Leeds, and Sutcliffe even named Savile in police interviews.

Sutcliffe was asked why he placed a victim's boots over her legs before he left the park.

He said: 'For two reasons. One, because I could hear voices from I don’t know where and a car had just driven into an entrance just behind the building — that was the block of flats I found out later where Jimmy Savile lived.

'Secondly I was surprised to see how luminous she appeared in the dark.'

The sick pair later appeared to have formed a disturbing friendship, with the BBC star visiting the killer in jail and describing him as a 'mate' after later trips to see him in Broadmoor Hospital.

Dr Mace Joffe was sent from Harley Street to Leeds to make a cast of Savile's teeth, revealed the dentist's friend Nikki Critcher, an ex-model and former Benny Hill girl, in The Sun.

'He said he had been told by the police that Savile was known to them for using prostitutes and that he had been a potential suspect,' said Ms Critcher, who has now retrained as a lawyer.

'We were amazed,' said the mother of three and former Page 3 girl. 'We didn't think he'd be the sort - he was doing all his charity work and things.'

Dr Joffe died in 2003 and so cannot reveal more about the investigation.

A former detective who helped catch the Yorkshire Ripper this week made the shocking claim that Savile was quizzed over the serial murderer's crimes.

Former West Yorkshire detective John Stainthorpe told ITV Yorkshire Calendar News that Savile was brought in for questioning after members of the public contacted the police naming the eccentric DJ as a possible killer.

Mr Stainthorpe, who worked for the West Yorkshire force for more than 40 years, and who spent years trying to catch Sutcliffe, told the programme: 'When the Ripper was really active one of the suspects put forward by members of the public was Jimmy Savile, strange as it may seem.

'Obviously it was not him, but he was interviewed along with many others, as you can appreciate.'

However, a West Yorkshire Police spokesman 
said: 'Hundreds of people were identified in the operation, we cannot be
 more specific than that at this time.

John Stainthorpe said a member of the public named Savile as a suspect

'Details of all who were questioned 
in connection with the crimes are in storage, so we cannot confirm that 
Jimmy Savile was spoken to.'

Mr Stainthorpe said the person who gave police the anonymous tip-off was 'aiming in the right direction'.

'Child perverts soon become child killers,' he added.

The detective's shocking revelation came as the killer said that Savile regularly visited him in custody and the pair became friends.

Rubbishing claims the late DJ abused 
around 300 victims over six decades, Sutcliffe said those making allegations 
were 'jumping on the bandwagon'.

The Yorkshire Ripper's horrific crimes shocked the nation as he embarked on a murderous rampage across the country, slashing his victims, mutilating them and killing them.

Between 1975 and 1980, the vicious murderer attacked women, stabbed them with screwdrivers, stamped on them, left notes with their bodies taunting police for not catching him and killed in total 13 women.

Officers desperate to catch him cast their net far and wide as they hunted for the man who signed his notes as 'Jack The Ripper' and launched a huge campaign, publishing his notes and voice recordings in a bid to have someone identify the murderer by his writing or voice.

In 1981 he was convicted of  murdering 13 women and attempting to murder seven others.

Sutcliffe, who will never be released from Broadmoor mental hospital, told the Sun that the claims made against his 'friend' Savile were exaggeration.

He said: 'It's a load of rubbish. People are just getting carried away.

'He visited a lot. He'd always come and chat with me on visits and I would introduce him to my visitors.

Several times he left £500 for charities I was supporting.'

One of Savile’s abuse victims urged police to investigate any links between the pair.

The victim said: 'Sutcliffe and Savile are two peas in a pod. It's quite fitting the only person to stick up for Savile is Sutcliffe.'

Sutcliffe's 'friend' Savile was said to have been given his own set of gold-plated keys to high-security Broadmoor, where the Ripper is a patient.

He was allegedly given bedrooms or an office at 
three hospitals, and this week more former patients came forward to say 
he abused them on children’s wards.

The details come after it was reported that Sutcliffe killed his third victim, 
Irene Richardson, yards from Savile’s flat in Roundhay, Leeds, in 
1977.

Miss Richardson was killed near the disgraced paedophile's three-bedroom penthouse, which overlooks Roundhay Park.

It is three miles outside Leeds city 
centre, with floor to ceiling windows, and has been put on the market 
for £325,000, with the proceeds intended for the Jimmy Savile Charitable
 Trust.

Savile's relatives said they do not 
want a penny of his £4.3million estate and called for the cash to be 
donated to an organisation to tackle sex crimes.

Mental hospital: A gold-plated set of keys to Broadmoor was presented to the predatory paedophile as a reward for his volunteering, and gave him access to mentally ill patients, it was claimed

At
 Broadmoor, Savile boasted that he was actually responsible for getting 
some mentally ill patients - among them murderers - freed from their 
sentences.

He called himself the ‘Governor’ of the 
hospital and was made chairman of a hospital taskforce by the Department
 of Health in the 1980s.

Savile, who died a year ago aged 84 in his Leeds flat, is now believed by police to be one of the UK's most prolific child abusers.

Scotland Yard is leading a national investigation into the television and radio star's activities.

Detectives are following 400 lines of inquiry while the BBC has launched an inquiry into the culture and practices at the corporation in the era of Savile's alleged sexual abuse.

The police launched a huge campaign to track down the killer who hurt so many women, and were given Savile's name by a member of the public during the inquiry

Last month health chiefs announced an inquiry into Savile’s reign of abuse at three NHS hospitals.

It will be run by the Department of Health itself, raising fears it cannot be truly independent.

Former barrister Kate Lampard will oversee the investigation to provide ‘independent oversight’, Downing Street pledged.

It will examine why the paedophile presenter was allegedly given the keys to Broadmoor, a bedroom at Stoke Mandeville and free rein at Leeds General Infirmary.

He allegedly raped and molested young victims for decades without anyone stopping him.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘[Kate Lampard] will provide oversight of the Stoke Mandeville, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor inquiries as well as the Department of Health’s inquiries into the appointment and role Savile held at Broadmoor Hospital.

‘All relevant information from these inquiries will be passed to the police.’

Unlike the BBC, which has issued several grovelling apologies, none of the hospitals has yet said sorry for the alleged abuse.

Savile, who raised £40million for the hospital in his lifetime, boasted that he ‘lived’ in a bedroom managers had given him at Stoke Mandeville, Buckinghamshire, and said he could do as he pleased.
