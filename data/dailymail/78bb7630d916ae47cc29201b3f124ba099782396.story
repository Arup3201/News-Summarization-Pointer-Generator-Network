Sacked: Leanne Phillips, 31, has won her unfair dismissal case against My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding dressmaker Thelma Madine, who fired her following a heated argument

A dressmaker who starred on the hit show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding unfairly dismissed her head designer after a heated row, a court has ruled.

Thelma Madine, 61, sacked Leanne Phillips, 31, last Christmas following a shouting match which ended with the employee calling her boss 'a horrible b****'.

However, a tribunal described her action as 'unreasonable' and criticised her for making it based on personal rather than business reasons.

Employment tribunal judge Vincent
 Ryan also described the atmosphere at the bridal shop as 'volatile', and 
that much of this atmosphere was down to a need to provide added drama 
for the reality television show.

Miss Phillips brought the case against Ms Madine last December, after she was sacked from Nico Bridal Company in Liverpool, where she had worked for six years.

Channel Four star Ms Madine once praised Miss Phillips for for taking her business 'to another level'.

However she fired her former pal allegedly following a shouting 
match which ended with Miss Phillips calling her Ms Madine a ‘horrible 
b****’.

Judge Ryan ruled that Ms Madine, who Miss Phillips described as 'like an aunt', had reacted to the insult 'as a friend', rather than an employer, and not for a reason relating to her work.

Ms Madine, who rose to fame designing opulent dresses for traveller brides has now been ordered to pay Miss Phillips £1,200, and faces having to fork out more money in compensation.

The judge upheld Miss 
Phillips' claims that she was unfairly dismissed by Ms Madine, that she 
was owed wages, was provided with no written contract of employment and 
that her employer failed to follow ACAS guidelines when conducting the 
disciplinary procedure.

In his judgement ruling Mr Ryan said: 'All things and 
personalities considered, the atmosphere in the place of work was 
volatile and loud rows would erupt.

'Staff shouted at each other and could be abusive on occasions.

'This
 informality and volatility was tolerated by the respondent and to an 
extent, particularly when filming of the television documentary, was 
actively appreciated by the respondent so as to avoid the risk of the 
film footage being perceived to be boring.'

Ruling: My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding star Thelma Madine, left, has been ordered to pay Miss Phillips £1,200 in back pay by the employment tribunal.

The tribunal heard how prior to Miss Phillips losing her £400-a-week job at Nico, she and Ms Madine had been firm friends.

Miss
 Phillips had known Ms Madine since she was just four years old, and her
 former employer had even bought her a car for her 30th birthday.

'The respondent was very generous to the claimant and they worked closely together,' said the judgement.

'The
 claimants appeal against dismissal was not dealt with promptly and 
there was considerable delay in the holding of the appeal hearing.

'The investigation into the matter was flawed.

'The
 claimant was dismissed for personal reasons of the respondent that 
related to the claimants personal conduct towards her and not for a 
reason that related to conduct having a bearing on her work.

Unfair: Tribunal Judge Vincent Ryan upheld Miss Phillips' claims that she was unfairly dismissed by Ms Madine, who rose to fame on the Channel four show

'The respondent reacted to an insult from a friend in personal circumstances, rather than as a reasonable employer.

'The matter was personal and not business.'

Ms Madine was ordered to pay back the
 £1200 that had been deducted from Miss Phillips's wages, and a 
compensation package will be agreed at a remedy hearing next year.

During
 the tribunal Miss Phillips had claimed that there were regular 
arguments at the business which nobody else was punished for and that 
there was no discipline structure.

Employment:  Ms Madine paid Leanne Phillips £400 a week to design dresses for Nico Bridal Company, based in Liverpool

Her
 mother Pauline Wooley also gave evidence suggesting Ms Madine, who rose
 to fame on the Channel Four series about the traveller community, 
routinely mistreated her staff.

Ms Wooley, who is currently suspended from her role as Assistant Manager
 at the company, told the court hearing in Liverpool that she was 
'treated like a dog' by her employer, who had also been a close friend 
for more than 20 years.

However, Peter Maratos, an employment expert speaking on behalf of Ms 
Madine, said that Miss Phillips was 'spoiled' and 'over-reacted' after 
the publicity from featuring on the TV programme had 'gone to her head'.

Speaking about the result, Ms Phillips said: 'I am over the moon with the outcome.

It has been a long process, coming up to a year since I was dismissed, and I am really pleased.

'I knew that there was only ever going to be one verdict.

'Judge Ryan saw through all of the lies - thank god he did.'

Miss
 Phillips has now launched her own fashion business - Leanne Alexandra -
 and has been flooded with orders for christening and communion dresses 
from the gypsy community.

She added: 'It is onwards and upwards from here for me.

'I am concentrating on my business.

'I have had plenty of orders already and everyone has been so supportive of me.'

Ms Madine, who denied the claims made at the tribunal, was unavailable for comment.

Miss
 Phillips's solicitor Stephen Pinder said: 'It was one of the most 
overwhelming decisions I have seen in favour of the claimant.

'Leanne is delighted with the outcome and looks forward to continuing her new business.'

After the success of the Gypsy Wedding series, Ms Madine went on to appear in spin-off Thelma's Gypsy Girls

The
 court case came just one year after Ms Madine published her autobiography, 
Tales of The Gypsy Dressmaker, in which she praised Miss Phillips.

She
 wrote: 'Leanne is now the head designer at Nico and is starting to 
oversee parts of the process that I had to do, which is great, because 
it means that I can concentrate on other parts of the business.

'I used to feel that every one of my 
dresses was like my baby and that no one could do them as well as me but
 I know now that the future of Nico is in Leanne's hands.

'Since
 she started working for me, Leanne has taken Nico to another level. Not
 only that, she also inherited her mum Pauline's determination and 
loyalty.

'And I have to admit that she reminds me of me at her age, full of imaginative ideas and passion for the task in hand.'
