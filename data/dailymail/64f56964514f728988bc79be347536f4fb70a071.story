She's better known for her riding skills while her cousin is famous for his penchant for polo and parties - rugby players they are not.

But that wasn't enough to stop Zara Phillips and Prince Harry from signing up for a wheelchair rugby match - also known as 'murderball' - being held this evening in support of the Invictus Games.

Harry, in 
particular, looked eager to get involved and offered no quarter to 
anyone as he stormed up and down the pitch in his wheelchair.

Zara herself is no stranger to the world of rugby, having been married to Rugby World Cup winner Mike Tindall for just over three years.

Her cousin too is famous for his love of rugby and is regularly seen watching the game, frequently during the Six Nations tournament, from the stands.

But while they might enjoy watching a match or two, none of that would have prepared them for the wheelchair variant.

Fiercely competitive, 'murderball' involves two teams of 12 battling it out to get the ball across the opposition's goal line within 40 seconds.

Ready for action: Zara looks a little nervous as she arrives with husband Mike ahead of the match

Ominously for the royal pair, the game is also a full contact sport with players allowed to use their wheelchairs to aggressively block opponents.

Zara, at least, had some experienced help at hand in the shape of husband Mike who lined up alongside her.

Earlier today, the young royals were put through their paces by team coaches, Sir Clive Woodward 
and Jonny Wilkinson.

Other players include Dame Kelly Holmes, heptathlete Denise Lewis and former England rugby star, Jason Robinson.

Professionals lining up alongside and against the royals include Team GB star Ben Steele, Australia's Dennis Ramsay and All Black Bill Blakely.

Despite showing signs of nerves as she arrived at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park with husband Mike, Zara said she was 'excited to be involved'.

'It’s important to get involved in the Invictus Games to use the power of sport to inspire recovery and support rehabilitation,' she revealed, adding: 'I’m very excited to be involved.'

Also looking forward to a good match was Dame Kelly, a former soldier herself, who said: 'As an ex-military soldier, I'm extremely honoured to be part of the Invictus Games.

'I have immense admiration for all these service men and women who have served their country. I'm very much looking forward to being part of the games and I'm sure I will be in awe of all the events and all those taking part.

'I wish everyone good luck in their preparation and look forward to taking part myself.'

Prince Harry has spent much of the day taking in the sights at the Invictus Games and, earlier, was on hand to see Team GB's wheelchair rugby stars triumph over a strong Danish side.

The Invictus Games, a project Prince Harry is passionate about, opened on Wednesday night with a ceremony that included a flypast from the Red Arrows.

The prince, who was cheered enthusiastically by servicemen during the event, was also on the receiving end of cheers when he and the Duke of Cambridge arrived at the Lee Valley Athletics Centre yesterday morning.

The Invictus Games run until Sunday night, with the royal expected at events taking place over the weekend, including the wheelchair basketball tomorrow and the swimming the following day.

Harry, who celebrates his 30th birthday on Monday, will also be at the Closing Concert on the final day of the Games, where, among others, the Foo Fighters, Ellie Goulding and James Blunt will take to the stage.
