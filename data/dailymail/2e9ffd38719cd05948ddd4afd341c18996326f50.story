Ann Romney slammed the door Monday on another attempt at the White House for her husband Mitt, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee.

Attempting to put a pin in rumors that her husband is secretly plotting another campaign for higher office once and and for all, Romney told a reporter for the Los Angeles Times that she and Mitt were 'done' running for president 'completely.'

'Not only Mitt and I are done, but the kids are done,' she said, referring to the couple's five sons.

'Done. Done. Done,' she added, making her feelings on the matter crystal clear.

Mitt has repeatedly said he's not preparing for another run, but a series of vague statements from both Romneys about what it would take to change their minds have had the political world buzzing for the last several months about a possible 2016 campaign.

First Mitt claimed that 'circumstances can change.' Then Ann indicated that her husband may consider a comeback if former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush bowed out of the race.

Mitt tried to clear up any remaining doubt about his intentions earlier this month, telling a horde of reporters chasing him around a Kentucky event for for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, 'I'm not running, I'm not planning on running and I expect to be supporting one of the many people who I think are looking at this race.'

He repeated the refrain in an on-camera interview with Bloomberg reporters John Heilemann and Mark Halperin.

'I'm not letting my head go there. Where I'm focused on making sure we nominate the right person, who cares about the kinds of issues I care about,' he stated. 

In her interview with the LA Times, Ann said she hadn't 'been pushed to that point mentally' to truly consider another run, and the publication said she indicated that she and Mitt would make the decision together if it ever came to that point.

Among Ann's list of 'really interesting' Republicans who may enter the race next year, the LA Times said, were Bush, Ohio Sen. Rob Portman and her husband’s 2012 running mate, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan.

'We’re going to see a nice field shake out,' she said.

Mitt has not said who he's leaning toward in 2016.

'We have a number of different voices within our party that have have different views about where America should go, and I look forward to supporting one of them,' he said, according to The Courier-Journal.

Romney was flocked over the weekend by supporters of his previous presidential campaigns. They're hoping he decides to run again even though he's explicitly said he won't

Romney supporters have continued to hold out hope that the retired Republican politician will change his mind, however, and are aggressively encouraging him to run when he makes appearances on the campaign trail for the GOP candidates competing in November's elections.

'When you get elected to the Senate, your job should be to convince Mitt Romney to run for president again,' a donor reportedly told Iowa senate candidate Joni Ernst him last weekend at a private fundraiser that Romney headlined.

The Washington Post says that at another event for Ernst on Sunday night, several businessmen approached Romney about another run.

At a rally for Ernst on Monday, the Post says a state legislator who introduced Romney said, 'If his address was 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, I would sleep a lot better.' Attendees also chanted, 'Run, Mitt, run!' the Post reported.

Romney has experienced similar nudging from backers at events across the country. Clad in Romney campaign gear, dire-hard fans have turned out at several major campaign events the former Massachusetts governor has spoken at this fall.

But the Romenys have their designs set on other, non-political projects after the midterm elections, including spending more time with their children and 21 grandchildren, and raising money for the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.

The Romneys are in the process of launching the Ann Romney Center for Neurological Diseases at Brigham.

The LA Times, which interviewed Ann for the specific purpose of talking about the research facility, reports that the center will look for cures and treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, Parkinson’s disease, brain tumors and a research facility that will focus on finding cures and new treatments for Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, a disease Ann suffers from.

Ann Romney is seeking to raise $50 million dollars in seed money for the center to mirror the 50 million people afflicted with the five diseases, the Times said.

Tonight the Romneys are hosting a dinner for former donors and political associates - strictly to raise money for the research center, the Post reports.
