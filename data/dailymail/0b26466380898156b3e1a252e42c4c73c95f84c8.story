She's less than two weeks into her reign but Spain's Queen Letizia was every inch the royal style icon as she was welcomed by Portuguese First Lady Maria Cavaco Silva in Lisbon today.

Fresh from a successful trip to meet the Pope at the Vatican, Letizia was immaculate in a silver-grey sheath dress and tailored jacket, accessorised with a chic snakeskin clutch.

Letizia and her husband, the new King Felipe VI of Spain, are on a state visit to Portugal, the first of a series that also includes trips to France and Morocco.

Glamorous: Spain's Queen Letizia meets Portuguese First Lady Maria Cavaco Silva in Lisbon

The royal couple travelled to Portugal at the request of President Aníbal Cavaco Silva, who sent an invitation along with a message of congratulation following their coronation on the 19th June.

Since then, their duties have included a trip to Rome where they met Pope Francis at the Vatican and a number of engagements in Spain, among them the 150th anniversary celebrations for the Spanish Red Cross in Madrid.

There, the new Queen, immaculate as ever, was mobbed by adoring crowds - although even that failed to leave her looking less than lovely.

Now considered one of the world's most glamorous monarchs, Letizia is as famous for her dress sense as she is for her charity work.

The 41-year-old mother-of-two has carved out a name for herself as a royal style icon and even, on one memorable occasion, managed to outshine the ultra-glamorous Carla Bruni.

Stylish: Letizia is now considered one of the world's most glamorous monarchs thanks to her killer wardrobe

Her current wardrobe of tailored sheath dresses, sky-scraping court shoes and eye-catching jewels is all a far cry from her early days as a newsreader, when she embraced the bland Armani suit and was rarely seen in public wearing anything else.

But since marrying into the Spanish royal family in 2004, her wardrobe has undergone a remarkable transformation.

She adores a leg-lengthening nude heel and is almost as addicted to her Magrit suede tan court shoes as the Duchess of Cambridge is to her nude patent L.K Bennett 'Sledge' heels.

The Spanish queen also shares another trait with the UK's future queen: a penchant for homegrown labels and the high street. In Letizia's case, that means slim-fitting sheath dresses picked up in Mango, Zara and Uterqüe - many of which she wears time and time again.

That, however, doesn't mean she won't splash out on a more expensive frock should one catch her eye. Her favourite piece is reportedly a black guipure lace dress by local designer, Felipe Varela, which she wore on her last visit to Portugal in 2012, again for her 40th birthday party and again in March this year.

Another favourite is a softly fitted yellow and royal purple print dress by Hugo Boss which made its first appearance in summer 2012 before being dusted off the following year and spruced up with a black blazer.

Off duty, the Princess' style becomes markedly more relaxed, with cropped trousers, billowing shirts and even the odd pair of jeans making up the bulk of her wardrobe.

But as her occasional foray back into grey Hugo Boss tailored trousers reveals, some style habits die hard - Queen or not.
