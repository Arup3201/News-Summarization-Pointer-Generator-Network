Arsenal mischief makers Jack Wilshere and Wojciech Szczesny reflected their side's high spirits on Friday as they attempted to recreate Daniel Sturridge's famous goal celebration.

As Sturridge closes in on a return to the Liverpool side after injuring his thigh on international duty, England team-mate Wilshere and Gunners goalkeeper Szczesny joked as they mimicked the former Chelsea star's moves.

Sitting in what appears to be a canteen area, Polish shotstopper Szczesny chuckles as he films whilst ordering the 23-year-old midfielder to 'dance!'.

Looking laid back in his club issue beanie hat Wilshere obliges by shaping up to do Sturridge's trademark dance, albeit with considerably less conviction.

Sturridge has not played for his club since a 3-0 win over Tottenham in August  and has only recently returned to Merseyside after treatment in the US.

Liverpool await Sturridge's return with bated breath whilst their available strikers struggle for goals.

Other than Sturridge, Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini are the only Reds front men to have scored a league goal this term - netting just three Premier League goals between them all season.
