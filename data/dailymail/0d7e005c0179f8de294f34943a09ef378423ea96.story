An Illinois man is serving 26 years in prison for the historical murder of a 17-year-old boy, but the star witness in the case has admitted he lied to prosecutors.

Mario Casciaro was convicted of killing Brian Carrick in a grocery store cooler room in 2002 - he has always insisted he is innocent.

He was jailed in 2010 after Shane Lamb told police that he had hit Carrick over a drug debt and Casciaro has told him he would sort out Carrick's unconscious body.

But now Lamb has recanted his testimony, saying he lied to prosecutors and lied under oath.

'All of it was false. Every single thing…. The state's attorney set it up,' Lamb told ABC News' '20/20'.

'Mario is in there for 26 years for something he didn't do.' 

Carrick disappeared December 20, 2002 in the evening.

Both Carrick and Casciaro worked as stock boys at Val's Grocery, the Johnsburg, Illinois, grocery store co-owned by Casciaro's father.

'I saw Brian once at the beginning of my shift,' Casciaro told ABC News.

'Brian was looking for Rob Render [another stock boy] and had asked me if I'd seen him, and I paged him, and that was the last time I seen him. That's it.'

Casciaro said he then went to a party at a friend's house and stayed the night. 

That was the last sighting of Carrick - he was reported by missing his family and the grocery store put up a $25,000 reward to to find him. 

His body has never been found and his mother died in 2009.

Casciaro went to Illinois State University and got a received his degree in finance before returning to help his father expand the family business. 

But then, in 2010, when Lamb was facing 12 years in prison on cocaine charges in 2009, he made a deal with prosecutors.

Lamb, now 30, had also worked as a stock boy with the Carricks and Casciaro at Val's Grocery in 2002.

He told authorities and jurors that he punched Carrick in the producer cooler because Casciaro sent him to collect on a drug debt from the missing teen and that Casciaro was a drug dealer.   

Casciaro has admitted he would sometimes sell weed, but insists it was from his private collection. 

Lamb told police in a video tape that he had punched Carrick several times, leaving him unconscious in the produce cooler. 

He claimed that Casciaro told him to leave and that he would take care of Carrick.

Technicians testified they were 99.9 percent positive that blood collected around the cooler and a trash compactor was from a child born to the Carricks. 

In exchange for his confession, Lamb was granted immunity on all charges related to Carrick's death and a reduced sentence on the cocaine conviction. 

Following the revelation Casciaro was arrested and charged with first-degree murder with intimidation and unlawful restraint in Carrick's disappearance. 

Casciaro pleaded not guilty, but on April 2, 2013, the then-29-year-old  was found guilty of first-degree murder with intimidation.

After the sentencing William Carrick said he was glad the case in his son's death was finally over, reports the Daily Herald.

'I'm pleased with the sentence. This has been a tragic, tragic case and I certainly don't have any words of wisdom,' he said. 

'I don't know if there can be justice in a case like this. It's just too crazy.'

'I sit every day in a five-by-ten concrete box thinking ... 'How did this happen?' said Casciaro to ABC News.

In a sworn statement on Friday, Lamb, 30, recanted earlier accounts of what happened the night. 

'I want to make it clear that I had nothing to do with attacking Brian,' Lamb's statement reads reports NorthWest Herald.

'If he is dead, I have no knowledge where his body is located. 

'I also want to make it clear that I have no knowledge suggesting in any way that Mario was involved in attacking Brian or disposing of his body.'

The affidavit filed in McHenry County  alleges that Assistant State's Attorney Michael Combs fed him details of the case in order to implicate Casciaro for the murder.

'Prior to receiving my immunity deal, Prosecutor [Michael] Combs, knew that I was going to accuse Mario of involvement in the killing because he told me what to say and I agreed to it,' Lamb says in court documents. 'Prosecutor Combs knew my statements accusing Mario were false.'

Combs and State's Attorney Lou Bianchi rejected Lamb's claims, noting that his statements to authorities were made in the presence of his attorney, were video recorded, and that the video was turned over to Casciaro's defense attorney.

Based on the recantation and other evidence, his attorneys are asking the court to vacate his conviction and order a new trial.
