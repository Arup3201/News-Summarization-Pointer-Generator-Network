Three men who were jailed for almost 20 years over the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl have been released after new DNA evidence came to light.

Robert Taylor, 34, said it felt 'beautiful' to be free 20 years after being sent to prison for the attack on Cateresa Matthews in Dixmoor, near Chicago.

Brothers Jonathan Barr, 34, and James Harden, 36, have also been told they will be released while prosecutors are confident the final two men will also be exonerated.

Cateresa disappeared after leaving her 
grandmother's house in November 1991 and her body was found weeks later 
near a highway with a gunshot wound to the mouth.

The murder went unsolved for about a year before five teenagers were arrested in 1992.

Two signed confessions and agreed to 
testify against the others for shorter prison sentences, even though 
attorneys said there were inconsistencies in their testimony and DNA 
evidence taken from the girl did not match any of them.

Robert Taylor, 34, who walked out of Stateville Correctional Center in Illionois yesterday, said it was great to be out.

'I'm still getting used to it. (But) I knew it would come,' he said.

'I'm always going to be angry, due to what
was taken away from me. I can't get that back.

'I'm not 
going to let my anger drive what I want to do with the rest of my life. 
There is so much I want to do.'

Wrongly convicted: James Harden, 36, was just a teenager when he was charged with murder

Prosecutors reopened the case this year after new DNA testing linked a convicted rapist to the crime.

He has not been charged with the killing, but remains under investigation.

The 53-year-old is currently serving time behind bars for a drugs offence, authorities said.

Two years ago defense attorneys 
asked for new DNA testing to be carried out amid growing fears the five had been wrongly convicted.

Earlier this year the breakthrough came when swabs from the 1991 murder were matched to a man who is now aged 53.

The group - dubbed the Dixmoor Five - all knew each other and the victim from school.

Defense attorneys claimed the 
teenagers were questioned relentlessly - and at least one of them was 
told he could see his parents if they confessed.

Robert Lee Veal, 34, and Shainne 
Sharp, 36, confessed and agreed to testify against the others in 
exchange for reduced 20-year prison sentences. Records show each served 
about 10 years.

Veal, who has 'severe learning 
disabilities,' could not read when he was arrested and signed a 
confession not knowing what it was, his attorney Stuart Chanen said.

Taylor also had confessed to the 
crime, but later recanted saying it was coerced. He and Harden were 
sentenced to 80 years in prison. Barr received 85 years.

Robert Taylor's attorney Josh Tepfer said: 'It's truly unexplainable.

'It's one of the most tragic injustices in this state's history. It's five kids who were wrongfully convicted... while a true perpetrator went on and lived a criminal lifestyle.'

Robert Lee Veal, 34, has been unable to find work because of his conviction

Barr and Harden were both in custody at Menard Correctional Center and will be released once paperwork has been completed.

Tara Thompson, who represented Harden, said: 'Their mother and father passed away while they were in prison.

'He missed the opportunity to go to college. Everything you've done in your life since high school, he's missed out on that.'

The case is among the dozens of wrongful conviction cases in Illinois made public in recent years.

Allegations of torture and coerced confessions by Chicago police eventually helped lead then-Republican Governor George Ryan in 2000 to impose a moratorium on Illinois' death penalty.

Shainne 
Sharp, 36, is now behind bars after committing a separate drugs offence.

Veal, 34, is 'very happy' to have heard the news, his attorney said. While he has been out of prison since 2002, his conviction dramatically altered the course of his life and he has been unable to find work.

'It's virtually impossible to get a job with a murder conviction, with being an ex-con ... on your rap sheet,' his Attorney Stuart Chanen said.

'At least he gets the stench of that off his record.'
