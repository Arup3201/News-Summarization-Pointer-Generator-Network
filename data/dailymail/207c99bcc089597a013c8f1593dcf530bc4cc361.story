Swooping low over sunbathing holiday makers, or flying high with the birds, this stunning collection of images captures both the drama and the serenity of aircraft in flight.

Although many of us boarding a plane 
without a second thought and see an airliner glide through the skies 
above us almost every day, the collection gives a unique glimpse into 
the aviation world.

The dramatic photographs have been released by a specialist photography service and image library Airteam Images to celebrate its 10th birthday.

Over the past decade the photographs have been seen in publications and personal photo albums 
around the world, as the company, based in Coleshill, West Midlands, sell hundreds of their pictures to both commercial business and the
 general public.

Among some of the more exciting photographs in the collection are the flock of birds surrounding and Air Canada Boeing 777, a US Airways Boeing 757 coming into land seemingly just metres from a packed beach at St Maarten, Princess Juliana, The Netherlands, and a mid air display by the famed Red Arrows.

Director Derek Pedley said: 'We are the largest supplier of aviation images in the world.

'We have 200 photographers which I have handpicked and we have a portfolio of images that tell the whole history of aviation right back to the 1900s.

'10 years is a great milestone to get to - we took off with the Internet revolution and we haven't looked back.

'Happy birthday Airteam Images.'

Mr Pedley's love of aircraft began when he was a child, making his love for the job even stronger. 

He said: 'I have a real fascination with planes, which was probably kickstarted by me growing up next to Birmingham Airport.

Memories of the past: The Airteam image library contains photographs documenting every aspect of the world of aviation, from the biggest super jumbos to this Aviat Christien Eagle II flying in Argentina

'I would go with my friends and play football behind the fences which ran alongside the runways. 

'When photography came along it helped to keep the interest going, and here I am today.'

Airteam boasts more than 130,000 images within its online portfolio alone, and it comes as no surprise that manufacturing giant Boeing is their biggest client.

Have a heart: Cutting through a heart-shaped gap in the clouds seems particularly apt when you consider this 747 is taking off from Paris - the city of love

The library contain's photographs documenting every aspect of the world of aviation - both civilian and military, taking in the very early days of aeroplane flight to the modern airliners and executive planes.

'I never thought I would make a living out of planes,' said Mr Pedley.

'It started out as a hobby and snowballed to the size it is now. 

'It's quite a unique collection but it's a one-stop shop for anything to do with aviation.'

Great and small: Pictured together this larger Embraer ERJ190 and the smaller Boeing 777 almost appear to be a family unit as they taxi in Amsterdam
