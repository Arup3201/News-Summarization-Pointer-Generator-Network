Mother: Patricia Crawley, 33, has been found guilty of child endangerment after abandoning her newborn child in a cardboard box during a crack binge

A Philadelphia woman who admitted being on a crack binge when abandoning her newborn baby in a cardboard box days before Christmas has been found guilty of child endangerment.

Patricia Crawley, 33, said she was embarrassed, 'bleary,' and didn't have a phone on her when she dropped her baby, umbilical cord still attached, in the box outside a daycare center last December.

Found just days before Christmas by a church custodian who heard the baby crying, the little girl was named 'Noel.'

The 77-year-old man said the infant 
appeared to have been there for only a few hours and was wrapped in a 
sweater, robe, towel and a blanket.

Crawley
was tracked down and arrested months later in February but acquitted of
her charges of attempted murder and aggravated assault on Friday.

'For
attempted murder (or) aggravated assault, you have to find she intended
to harm the baby or kill the baby,' defense attorney Patrick Link told CBS. 'And when you are in that situation, a judge or jury is basically 
left to read the mind of the defendant.'

Mr Link said that his client's 'moral compass that day was not completely intact.'

'I was kind of passed out a little bit,' she said in a statement according to Philly.com. 'Everything was kind of bleary because I was getting high.'

'You don't get out of your criminal conduct because you take some crack,' Assistant District Attorney Tiffany Oldfiel said. 'She had nothing on her mind, just throwing the baby out with the trash.'

Sentencing will begin on December 10.
