Incredible footage has emerged of a driver leaping from his moving car to rescue his child who had fallen out onto a busy road junction.

The four-year-old girl can be clearly seen dropping out of the front door at the bustling crossroads in China and narrowly missing the back wheel.

A taxi driver following close behind has to slam on the brakes and manages to bring the vehicle to a sudden halt just yards from the terrified infant.

The unmanned car the father and daughter were traveling in is left to fly off the road and smash into a tree.

The petrified youngster was said to have suffered only bruising during the shocking ordeal - which police said happened after she opened the door accidentally while climbing into the front seat.

Officer Chen Shu said: 'When it happened, a nearby taxi and all the other cars weren't going too fast, and the taxi braked immediately so it did not hit the child.'
