When Martha Payne started posting pictures of her miserable school dinners online, she realised it may ruffle a few feathers.

But the nine-year-old never expected her blog to spark a full-scale internet revolt after council bureaucrats tried to ban her from telling the truth about her canteen meals.

The young campaigner also could not have predicted the blog's huge popularity would generate more than £60,000 in donations to help feed impoverished children around the world.

However, angry about the headlines Martha’s ‘NeverSeconds’ blog was generating, officials at Argyll and Bute council ordered teachers to stop her from photographing her dinners and rating them online.

Good cause: Martha's blog, Never Seconds, has raised more than £60,000 since she first started it

Victory! Martha Payne, 9, and her father David were all smiles after the council's decision to make a u-turn on banning her food blog

Blog over: Last night Martha posted a goodbye message

In a post headed ‘Goodbye,’ she wrote: ‘This morning in maths I got 
taken out of class by my head teacher and taken to her office.

‘I was told that I could not take any more photos of my school dinners.’

But the officials seriously underestimated the youngster’s internet 
following and thousands of people, led by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, 
took to Twitter to criticise their decision, leading to a humiliating 
U-turn by the council.

Within hours of Oliver tweeting to Martha to ‘stay strong’ and urging 
his 2.3million followers to re-post his message, the schoolgirl’s blog 
became one of the top subjects discussed on the site worldwide. Critics 
lined up to accuse the council of ‘bullying’ Martha by trying to 
‘silence her freedom of expression’ and thousands signed a petition to 
get them to overturn the ban.

Supporters inundated council phonelines with complaints and also pledged
 thousands of pounds to the Third World children’s charity linked to 
Martha’s blog, smashing her £7,000 target.

Donations, from supporters all over the world, including Canada, Germany, America, New Zealand and Australia, now stand at £61,519.07.

The decision also angered Scottish Education Secretary Mike Russell, whose intervention forced the council to perform a U-turn.

Council leader Roddy McCuish announced they would be withdrawing the ban
 with immediate effect. He said: ‘It’s a good thing to do, to change 
your mind, and I’ve certainly done that.’

Last night Martha’s father, Dave Payne, 39, said common sense had 
prevailed. ‘Martha is beaming,’ he said. ‘She came home from school with
 a big smile on her face.

‘She is delighted she can carry on blogging, but more so about the money
 being raised for the charity. People have been very, very generous. The
 way the world reacted to the ban is very revealing, it’s just fantastic
 that common sense has prevailed.’

Food for thought: Martha posted this picture on an internet blog and began to add daily snaps of her lunches, rating and commenting on them

Martha's miserable school dinners look set to spark an outcry over nutrition for the nation's children

The saga began seven weeks ago when Martha, with permission from 
teachers at Lochgilphead Primary School, started taking pictures of her 
£2 school dinners and commenting on them as part of a writing project.

Because Martha’s home is on the west coast of Scotland, however, 
standards for school meals differ and widespread improvements in the 
rest of Britain appear not to have been applied.

Her first post included a photo of a measly slice of pizza and a lonely 
potato croquette, alongside a sprinkling of sweetcorn, a cupcake for 
dessert and a lot of empty space.

Alongside the photo, the schoolgirl wrote: ‘The pizza in the first pic 
was alright but I’d have enjoyed more than one croquette. I’m a growing 
kid and I need to concentrate all afternoon and I can’t do it on one 
croquette. Do any of you think you could?’

Beside a photograph of a limp looking cheeseburger, two potato croquets,
 a few rings of cucumber and a rocket ice lolly, Martha wrote: ‘Today’s 
meal was on the menu as Cheeseburger and ice cream/biscuit but as you 
can see I got an ice lolly. I prefer ice cream. I wish they had stuck to
 the menu.’

Over the next two months her daily snaps gathered an impressive 
following, with more than two million people throughout the world 
logging on and sending in their own pictures for her site.

After seeing the photographs, Oliver, a veteran school food campaigner, 
sent a tweet to her father, which read: ‘Shocking but inspirational 
blog. Keep going. Big love from Jamie x.’

Martha later posted that the celebrity chef had sent her a copy of his 
Jamie’s Great Britain cookbook in which he wrote: ‘Dear Martha, great 
work!!! Clever girl. Lots of love. Jamie O. XXX Keep it up!!’

But on Thursday, Martha, whose mother is a GP, revealed that teachers 
wanted her to stop taking the photographs. The council said the decision
 was made after an article published in a tabloid newspaper, under the 
headline ‘Time to fire the dinner ladies’, left some members of staff at
 the school in tears.

In an ill-judged 500-plus word statement, they accused Martha’s blog of 
being ‘misleading’ and attacked her father for refusing to put an end to
 it.

Mr Payne, who runs a smallholding, correctly predicted the move was an 
‘own goal’ which would serve only to generate more criticism because 
‘the pictures tell the story about how good the food is’.

Last night the Argyll-based Mary’s Meals, the charity supported by 
Martha’s blog, revealed she had raised enough to build several kitchens 
for starving children in Malawi.

The charity said: ‘Martha’s support for Mary’s Meals has been amazing 
and we are extremely grateful for everything that she has done to help 
us reach some of the hungriest children in the world.’
