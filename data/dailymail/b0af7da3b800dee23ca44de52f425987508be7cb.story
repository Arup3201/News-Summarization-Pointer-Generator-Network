The Irish Rugby Union is reportedly considering charging the Australian Rugby Union for dressing room damage caused by a Wallabies staff member following last week's Test in Dublin.

The Irish Examiner newspaper said a door and hinges were broken at Aviva Stadium in Dublin, causing 'a few thousand euros' worth of damage but the ARU owned up to the incident soon after the 26-23 loss.

It is not clear which staff member caused the damage but it is not believed to be coach Michael Cheika, who accidentally smashed a glass door at Canberra Stadium last year after a Waratahs defeat.

The Wallabies on Wednesday played down the incident, insisting it was not related to an angry outburst.

'There was an accident after the match involving one of our support staff,' a Wallabies spokesman said.

'We made the IRFU aware of this on the evening of the game and have offered our assistance in any way if required.'

The newspaper said the IRFU would not comment publicly but was weighing up whether to bill the ARU for the damage.
