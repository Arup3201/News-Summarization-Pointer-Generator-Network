A 16-year-old girl who was kidnapped as she waited for a bus has escaped her captor's clutches by wriggling her hands free from their binds and stabbing him with his knife.

The girl, who has not been identified, has been treated in a Denver area hospital and released after suffering cuts to her hands during the stabbing - but her kidnapper is still at large.

The incident began on Wednesday evening when the suspect pulled up beside the girl as she waited for a bus in Edgewater, Colorado and asked her for directions.

After offering her a ride, she apparently willingly got into his truck, but as they neared her home in Edgewater, he pulled the vehicle into an alleyway and threatened to hurt her, police said.

She told authorities that he pulled out a knife, bound her hands with rope and began to drive away.

After driving for about an hour on what police say was Interstate 225 in Aurora, the girl said she was able to open the passenger door and stick out her legs in an attempt to alert another driver.

When it failed to work, she freed one of hands from the ropes and found the suspect's knife on the floorboard, Fox31 reported.

She grabbed it and lunged at the suspect, stabbing him in what she believes was his left shoulder and rib cage, police said.

The man stopped the vehicle and the girl jumped out and ran through a gap in the sound barrier walls before running to a nearby residence. The residents called police around 10pm.

'She kept her cool, which is tough to do in a situation like that. She had a plan and she carried that plan out,' Edgewater Police Chief John Hough said, CBS reported. 'She basically saved herself from a much more serious incident.'

Police are now looking for her captor.

He has been described as a black male, age 30 to 40, with clean-cut facial hair and gray hair on his chin. He also has clean cut hair or is bald, police said.

He was wearing a brown or green and white striped short-sleeve shirt and dark pants at the time of the attack, police said.

His car is a dark blue or black late model diesel pickup truck with a chrome stripe on the bottom of the sides and amber running lights on top, authorities added.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Edgewater Police Department at 720-763-3025 or the Jefferson County dispatch center at 303-271-0211.
