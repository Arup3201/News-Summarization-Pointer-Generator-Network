Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists Sergio Aguero is not even close to his best - but says the Argentina star has 'all the conditions' to become the best striker in world football.

Aguero scored four against Tottenham last week in a devastating display of finishing. He has been in frightening recent form, with eight goals in his last five games and 11 in 11 in all competitions.

The 26-year-old has been plagued with muscular injuries in recent seasons, which has effected his explosive style, but appears to have finally put them behind him.

'I don't think it's the best I've seen from him. I knew him a lot of years before he arrived in England when he played back in Spain (for Atletico Madrid),' said Pellegini.

'And in Manchester City's 2011-12 when they won the title he was a very important player. 

'Last year, he was very important when he was not injured. After that it was difficult for him, but that's normal. I was always sure he would return to normal performance.'

Asked if Aguero was the best striker in world, he added: 'He's a young player, he has a lot more years to improve, it depends what he wants to do in future. He has all the conditions to do it.'

Pellegrini revealed that Frank Lampard will not feature against his former club West Ham after failing to recover from a thigh strain in time.

Lampard will rejoin training with the squad next week and is not expected to be out long-term.

The midfielder had scans on the injury during the week, but Pellegrini does not want to risk him aggravating it further. 

Pellegrini does not believe that City's domination of the Hammers last season will have any bearing on this game.

The pair faced each other four times, twice in the league and twice in the Capital One Cup semi-final, and City won all four scoring 14 goals and conceding just once.

In their Capital One Cup semi-final first leg they hit six.

Pellegrini added: 'I don't think one season has any relation with the other one. It is a different moment. We will try to do our best to try and discount points on the leaders, which is Chelsea at the moment. 

'We will not think we scored six goals against them last season because that is an important mistake to think like that.'
