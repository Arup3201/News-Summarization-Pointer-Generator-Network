A craze in which people swallow a spoonful of cinnamon without water could choke participants, doctors have warned.

The so-called Cinnamon Challenge has resulted in some people being admitted to hospital. However, this has not stopped an army of young people taking part in the craze - and even a host of adults, including the Governor of Illinois and two NBA basketball players.

The 'challenge' has been around for years but - somewhat inexplicably - has suddenly spiked in popularity again with a surge of videos being uploaded to YouTube.

Easy does it: The most popular Cinnamon Challenge YouTube video shows a woman spooning a ladle of the finely-ground spice into her mouth

Hard to swallow: Almost immediately after eating the spice, she coughs up a cloud of cinnamon

Adverse reaction: This participant's amusing response to the challenge has earned her almost 9 millions views

About 30,000 clips tagged with the words 'cinnamon challenge' have been uploaded to the video sharing website.

Participants are seen pouring the finely-ground spice into their mouths and trying to swallow it without water.

The challenge is that because the 
spice is slow to break down it gets stuck in the throat - and as people 
try to swallow it they cough, gag and vomit.

Videos show people coughing up clouds of cinnamon, to raucous laughter in the background.

The Cinnamon Challenge involves swallowing a spoonful of ground cinnamon without drinking any liquids.

It is incredibly difficult as the spice dries the mouth out too quickly.

The challenge went viral on social networking sites last year and developed a celebrity following after Big Brother featured it as a 'house' task in 2011.

NBA stars Nick Young and JaVale McGee also posted a YouTube clip of themselves doing the Cinnamon Challenge.

However, doctors say the prank is dangerous as it could 
result in particles of the spice being inhaled through the windpipe and 
into the lungs, which could cause inflammation - and even choking.

A spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration told the Wall Street Journal: 'It is an 
obvious choking hazard and there is a risk of inhaling the dust. This 
certainly is not advisable.'  

One
video alone has been viewed almost 9 million times since it was 
uploaded last month. It shows a woman filling a ladle with cinnamon and 
carefully pouring the powdered spice into her mouth.

Moments later, she spits out the powder and a coughing fit ensues. Eventually she downs water to try to get rid of the cinnamon.

Other videos show teenagers coughing up clouds of powder and vomiting.

Parents are being warned to educate 
their children of the dangers after a student was admitted to hospital 
last month with lung problems.

And
some schools in the U.S. have banned students from bringing the spice 
on campus in a bid to stop them from taking part in the Cinnamon 
Challenge.

According to the
Wall Street Journal, one high school principal was forced to email 
parents after the students spent four days in hospital after attempting 
the challenge.

Arthur 
Williams, principal at Huron High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said: 
'The kids all know about this from the Internet but the parents have no 
idea.'

However, the Cinnamon Challenge is not just the preserve of the young. Adults are getting in on the action too.

Illinois
Governor Pat Quinn was asked to attempt the Cinnamon Challenge live on 
air while being interviewed on a Chicago radio show last month.

Governor Quinn was given a spoon of 
the powdered spice while he appeared on WGN-AM radio and was unflinching
as he put it in his mouth and took a swig of water.

Afterwards,
he calmly recited the his well-worn political phrase, 'The will of the 
people. The law of the land', as he was heaped with praise by host 
Jonathan Brandmeier.

YouTube hit: A cinnamon fog hangs in the air inside the woman's kitchen

Never again: It's doubtful this participant will attempt the Cinnamon Challenge a second time, judging by the look on her face

Comedienne Colleen Ballinger also filmed herself attempting the challenge in a bid to get more hits on her YouTube page.

She said she was urged to do it by her fans, but was warned off it by many others.

She told the Wall Street Journal: 'I thought everyone was being dramatic. But you really do feel like you're suffocating.'
