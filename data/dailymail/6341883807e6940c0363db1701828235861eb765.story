Every November, millions of men globally grow mustaches to raise awareness of men's health.

And this year, one woman did not want to miss out - despite being unable to grow facial hair.

Photographer Van Lokey-Saltzman, from Dallas, Texas, is transforming herself into an array of mustached men for Movember 2014 with the help of black face paint, hair gel,  props and an iPhone.

Stunning: Photographer Van Lokey-Saltzman, from Dallas, is transforming herself into an array of mustached men (including this one, pictured) for Movember with the help of black face paint, hair gel and some props

Dressed to impress: Every day, she selects a mustache from her collection of more than 50 - from big and bushy to thin and straight (pictured) - before undergoing the lengthy process of making it look realistic

Putting on years in just hours: This involves using face paint to darken the hair, eye liner to define the mustache, other makeup to contour and shade her face and old-fashioned clothes to enhance her character

Manipulation: To complete the look, Lokey plays around with a range of accents and poses, extending her jaw or twisting her head in a particular way (such as in the picture above) to manipulate her appearance

Photographer: She then prepares for the shot - which she takes not using a professional camera, but simply with an iPhone, selfie-style. She later posts her favorite images on Facebook. above, Lokey as herself

Every day, she selects a mustache from her collection of more than 50 - from big and bushy to thin and curled - before undergoing the lengthy process of making it look realistic.

This involves using face paint to darken the hair, eye liner to define the mustache, other makeup to contour and shade her face and old-fashioned clothes to enhance her character.

To complete the look, Lokey plays around with a range of accents and poses, extending her jaw or twisting her head in a particular way to manipulate her appearance, CNN reported. 

She then prepares for the shot - which she takes not using a professional camera, but simply with an iPhone, selfie-style. She later posts her favorite images on Facebook.

Another creation: 'What started out as a wacky Movember mustache photo project turned into a serious exercise in making me unrecognizable even to myself,' said Lokey, who has a degree in painting and drawing

Posing: 'Eventually my friends were like, "I don't even see you in this photo". And that made me think, "Wow, let me see what I can really do with this",' she added. Above, Lokey poses with a cigarette in her mouth

Well, hello there: Lokey first undertook the project last Movember after discovering some goofy stick-on mustaches lying around. She started putting them on and posting images online, but quickly became bored

Realistic: However, she still liked the idea of posing in mustaches to raise awareness of men's health, so she decided to make it more enjoyable by bringing her characters (such as this bushy-haired gentleman) to life

In addition to using props from her home and twisting her head to do so, she also decided to purchase more realistic-looking mustaches from an online theater shop. Above, this mustache was created with eyeliner

Old man: Although some of Lokey's characters may look familiar, most of them are not based on real people

Colorful: Instead, they are inspired by pictures the photographer finds online. Above, another character

Looking stern: And despite their incredible appearance, they have not been altered in Photoshop - although Lokey (pictured in another pose) does often add filters and brighten the images using a simple phone app

Big and bushy: 'Even though my pictures are not real, in that I'm trying to be someone else, I try to make sure they're real without altering them too much digitally,' said Lokey, pictured posing with a black pipe

Smiley: The photographer (pictured with her friend in a Facebook photo) spends up to two hours on each look

'Keeping the fake real is what I'm trying to do. If someone can't recognize me, I have done my job, said Lokey

Handle-bar mustache: The photographer has compiled her favorite characters in a book for her friends
