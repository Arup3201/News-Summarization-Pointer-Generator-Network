A senior legal clerk has been jailed for nine years for attempting to rape a 'lovely, sweet' female barrister at a Christmas party.

Jason Britcher, 40, sexually assaulted the sleeping lawyer by creeping into her hotel room after a night spent drinking whisky and snorting cocaine.

The brazen attack occurred five years after he had raped a barmaid following a wedding reception.

On each occasion Britcher, who was responsible for bringing in work for 50 barristers, was either high on drink or cocaine and looking for sex.

A jury of six women and five men took just two hours after an eight-day trial at Hull Crown Court to find him guilty of rape, attempted rape and once sexual assault.

They found him not guilty of one act of sexual touching on the barmaid.

Britcher, who has a 13-year-old daughter and wife, put his head in his hands and turned pale before crying. His barrister David Osborne said Britcher's mother was terminally ill and would not survive his sentence.

The prosecution claimed Britcher's clean-cut image as a charming gentleman masked a hard-drinking sexual predator. 

Judge Jeremy Richardson, QC, told Britcher: 'I have no doubt you are a man prepared to take risks and you unquestionably did that. You raped and attempted to rape two women when you were affected by alcohol and both women were asleep.

'You even perpetrated the two crimes by lifting their dresses in a very similar fashion whilst they lay asleep.

'This has been a catastrophe for everyone concerned. In many respects you deserve a more severe sentence, but I am mindful of the appalling affect this will have upon you and your family.'

His victim, a female barrister in her 30s in the room opposite his, was described by Britcher as a 'gentle, lovely, sweet girl - almost timid.'

The main attraction at the party was an ice sculpture, called a vodka luge, which allowed guests to take shots of Snaps poured down two luge runs from the top of an ice mountain into their open mouths. There was a DJ, karaoke, dancing and 'quite a lot of drinking.'

Britcher said he had taken cocaine, given to him by a barrister friend, while solicitors and barristers enjoyed wine, spirits and nibbles and let their hair down. During the evening he had also shared a bottle of whisky with a CPS lawyer before leaving around 3am.

He claimed his mind went blank after crashing on his bed and could not remember sending what he claimed were 'welfare' texts to two female barristers at 3.40am: 'Are you guys in the main room or Pleb X' and ' Make sure you are ok..I'm sleeping on the floor, u can have bed if struggling. X.'

The junior barrister told the jury she had enjoyed a 'really lovely, fun evening in a nice atmosphere' before offering to share a room with a female friend. She had left the party for the hotel leaving her room door unlocked. She texted her husband saying she 'loved him' before falling asleep in her party dress because she had forgotten her pyjamas and did not want her room-mate to see her naked.

She said: 'The next thing I remember was someone next to me cuddling up. I thought it was my husband. There was no initial alarm. I was fast asleep.

'But I felt that person touching me. I was asleep at the time and put my hand down and touched him. I think I became more aware at that point.'

She said she was sexually assaulted twice and could feel his weight on her as she slept face down. 

'I opened my eyes and looked and saw it was Jason. I think I said: "F*** Jason." He looked at me. I wanted to put my hands on my face. I said: "F*** off!" and kept repeating it.'

Britcher left the woman in a state of distress and went back to sleep in his hotel room. The junior barrister called her sister in tears, saying she had woken up to find a man 'on top of her.' She could barely breathe and talk and initially did not want to report it.

However, a solicitor doing an 'all-nighter' at the party was informed by a colleague and called the police.

Police, equipped with body cameras, were called to the hotel at 6am and Britcher was filmed snoring in his room, being woken and arrested on suspicion of rape.

He set about destroying forensic evidence by licking his fingers and dipping them in coffee provided in the police cell.

He told the jury he had sleep walked through three doorways looking for a toilet.

He claimed he had got in the junior barrister's bed by mistake and reacted on 'autopilot' when the woman touched his manhood. He admitted to the jury: 'When the realisation hit home, my whole world came crashing down. I panicked. I did not believe anyone would believe my story.'

In a victim impact statement, the barrister said she felt betrayed and the first week after the attack she felt sick and guilty for reporting it to the police.

She had to move chambers, lost out financially and had to be supported by family. She felt utterly defeated in August last year and went to the doctors to be described anti-depressants.

She had difficulty explaining what had happened to her mother and it had affected her relationship with her husband.

Britcher told the jury he worked his way up from being a humble listing officer to a senior clerk responsible for a criminal chambers, sitting on management committees.

He agreed to resign his job after being told he was to be charged. Meanwhile, the police found a second complainant, a woman in her 50s who he had raped after a wedding reception.

She told the jury: 'I thought everything was a dream. I could feel him inside me. I must have gone back to a deep sleep and the next thing I remember was his wife shouting at me.'

She was bleeding and a friend of the woman telephoned Britcher's wife telling her: 'This is rape. This is not right.' She did not report it after being begged not to do so because of the affect on his family.

Crown barrister John Thackray told the jury: 'We do not say he is a prolific sex attacker dragging women of the street with a mask on. He is an opportunist sex offender who takes his chance when it arises. He is capable of being polite, considerate, business like, perhaps even a gentleman. However, when a female is vulnerable, perhaps in drink, he will take his opportunity. He can be charming, but he can also be sinister.'
