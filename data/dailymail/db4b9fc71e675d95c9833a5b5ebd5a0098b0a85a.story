A First World War soldier who was called to the Western Front at short notice made a desperate bid to say goodbye to his family by scribbling a note in a matchbox and throwing it from a moving train.

Sergeant Major George Cavan hurled the message onto the platform of Carluke train station in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, and shouted to a passenger to give it to his wife, Jean.

The serviceman and his unit were suddenly called to fight in the Ludendorff Offensive - Germany's last major effort to win the war - from their base in Glasgow, but didn't have time to tell loved ones.

But just 15 days after penciling the note, Sgt Maj Cavan died after being injured in the battle, though his body was never found.

The note, which read 'Dearest wife and bairns, off to France - love to you all, Daddy', was picked up by someone on the platform and given to his wife Jean Cavan.

She kept the letter and matchbox for the rest of her life and handed it to her daughter Lucy who in turn left it to her daughter, Maureen Rogers.

The moving account, along with the matchbox, has emerged for the first time after being published on a website dedicated to telling untold stories of the First World War.

Mrs Rogers, 72, said: 'The matchbox and letter were treasured by my grandmother for the rest of her life.

'My grandfather must have thought "how on Earth am I going to let my family know I am going to war?"

'Luckily he had the presence of mind to write the note and throw it out of the train window at Carluke and luckily somebody picked it up and gave it to his wife.

The note was written in pencil on March 29, 1918, and read: 'Dearest wife and bairns, off to France, love to you all, Daddy'

'Sadly, it turned out to be the last letter my grandfather wrote. He didn't get the chance to write home when he got to France.

'It is a very precious item which I plan to give to his regimental museum as I don't have any direct descendants to give it to.'

Sgt Maj Cavan was regimental sergeant major in the 9th (Glasgow Highlanders) Battalion, Highland Light Infantry.

He spent much of the war training Territorial Army units in Scotland until March 1918 when orders came through for him to make his way to France to join his unit in Flanders.

He left his training camp in north Scotland on March 29 and travelled by train south to Glasgow and then through Carluke before heading for the south coast of England.

Mrs Rogers said: 'The train he was on with his troops went through his home station but did not stop there.

'He threw out onto the station platform a matchbox containing the folded note on the outside of which was the name of his wife. He yelled out "give this to Jean Cavan" to anyone who was on the platform at the time.'

He put the message in a matchbox and threw out the window of the moving train. Sgt Maj Cavan was killed 15 days after he passed through Carluke Train station, hurling the message

At the time Mrs Cavan was pregnant with the couple's fourth child, after daughters Jean, then aged four, and Lucy, two. Their eldest child, William, died at the age four from appendicitis.

Sgt Maj Cavan joined up with his unit on the frontline days later and on April 11 the men were in action, after British army chief Field Marshal Douglas Haig gave the infamous order for the men to fight to the death.

Due to the confused nature of the fighting, the exact circumstances of his death are not known but it is likely he was shot on April 11 or 12 and died of his wounds on April 13.

Mrs Rogers, a retired dermatologist, said: 'The news of his death reached Carluke before my grandmother received official confirmation.

'She was walking down the street and a woman stopped her to offer her commiserations. 

'She accused the woman of spreading lies and when she got home there was a man from George's regiment there who confirmed it.

'It was very hard on my grandmother who was left with three young children to look after. My mother was very clear with me as to how difficult it was for her.'

A few years after her husband's death, Mrs Cavan and her three daughters - Jean, Lucy and Georgina - moved to Australia where she had family.

After two years they returned to Scotland and Mrs Cavan began work as a night nurse while raising her children.

In 1949 her second daughter Lucy emigrated with her husband John and their daughter Maureen to Sydney and Jean joined them six years later.

Mrs Cavan died in 1964 while in her 70s and her daughter Lucy passed away eight years ago.

A relative of Mrs Rogers was attending Oxford University and a friend of hers was working on the Great War Archive.

The story of the matchbox was passed on to this researcher and appeared in the Oxford University Great War Archive and subsequently on the website Europeana 1914-1918. 

Sgt Major Cavan lies in an unmarked grave in Belgium and he is commemorated on the Ploegsteert Memorial near Ypres. 

French soldiers fighting during battle in the Ludendorff Offensive at Villers-Bretonneux, France, in April 1918

Beginning on March 21, 1918, the Ludendorff Offensive - also known as the Spring Offensive - was a series of German attacks along the Western Front during the First World War.

General Erich Ludendorff ordered the massive attack on the Western Front in a bid to end the war. The Allies were aware an ambush was imminent but did not know when it would come.

There were four German offensives, codenamed Michael, Georgette, Gneisenau and Blücher-Yorck.

In just five hours, the Germans fired one million artillery shells at the British lines held by the Fifth Army – over 3000 shells fired every minute. 

By the end of the first day of the attack, 21,000 British soldiers had been taken prisoner and the Germans had made great advances.

Commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, issued an 'Order of the Day' on 11 April stating, 'With our backs to the wall and believing in the justice of our cause, each one of us must fight on to the end.'

The German offensive began to stall and throughout the final two the side lost thousands of men and sustained 230,000 casualties - an issue it could not sustain.

The last German attack came on July 15 in attempt to draw Allied reserves south from Flanders. But their fuel-starved air force had lost air superiority to the Allies, advanced no further than the French Forward Zone.

The French launched a major offensive of their own on July 18, threatening to cut off the Germans. Ludendorff had to evacuate most of the men and the offensive was finally cancelled.

The initiative had clearly passed to the Allies, who were shortly to begin the Hundred Days Offensive which ended the war.
