There is growing evidence that obese women are putting additional strain on already under pressure maternity wards.

A new study, conducted by the University of Melbourne and to be completed by the end of this year, will measure 15,000 births to obese women across seven Victorian hospitals.

The ‘Mum size’ study will examine the effect of a mother’s BMI on caesarian time, pregnancy complications and their newborn child’s health.

Putting pressure on a stretched system: Anaesthetists are warning that obese women are putting increased pressure on maternity wards and hospitals

Utilising data already collected by maternity units, the research team will use the available data to study the interaction between mother’s size and birthing times.

‘We have an increasing number of larger women coming through maternity services – there’s a lot of anecdotal evidence that it's harder to care for larger women,’ Professor Dave Story, chair of Anaesthesia at the University of Melbourne, told MailOnline.

The study will not just be looking at the birthing process itself, but also the follow-on impact children born to overweight mother’s may have on the overall health system.

With little currently known about the link between overweight mothers and their child’s overall health, beyond the fact that sometimes their babies are born at a higher weight, the study will be useful in forecasting neonatal care in the future.

Professor Story is hopeful that the study will assist hospitals in planning the services provided for women having babies.

Ultimately, the study’s goal is to ‘look at the association with maternal BMI and the outcomes for their kids.’

Not much known: Little is currently known about the long-term risks faced by children born to obese mothers

Beyond the more well-known conditions faced by overweight women during pregnancy such as pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes, Professor Story added that there were also complications during the birthing process.

Overweight women also face an ‘increased risk of wound infection, the duration of the surgery, the amount of tissue involved and potentially also increased bleeding.’

The 'Mum size' study comes as anaesthetists re-examine the guidelines for administering surgery drugs to overweight patients.

‘We've known for a long time that a lot of the drugs we use are affected by the patient's body size and height,’ Professor Story said.

‘We need to alter our drugs, depending on how large a patient is.’

But luckily, with Australia’s growing obesity epidemic, Professor Story says they’re getting better at it.
