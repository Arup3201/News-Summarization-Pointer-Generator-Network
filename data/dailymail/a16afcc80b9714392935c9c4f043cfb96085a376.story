Spain manager Vicente del Bosque says Chelsea striker Diego Costa was right to pull out of his country's first Euro 2016 qualifier against Macedonia on Monday night.

Costa, 25, picked up a second hamstring injury in as many weeks playing for Spain against France last week, and will not feature against the European minnows in Madrid.

And Del Bosque insisted the withdrawal was not caused by pressure from Chelsea, who are keen to get their star striker fit for Saturday's clash with Swansea.

Good start: The Spanish striker has scored four times in his first three games for his new club

'It hasn't been easy with Diego,' said Del Bosque. 'All his teammates are trying to help him. He's a great guy and has always shown interest in playing for Spain.

'When there were doubts surrounding his fitness, he was the first wanting to join the squad. 

'Now he's in great form but I wouldn't suggest that he's feeling pressure from his club.'

Withdrawal: Costa picked up the minor hamstring injury against France last week, ruling him out for Monday

The Spain striker suffered hamstring problems towards the end of his final season with Atletico Madrid and was a doubt before his last club fixture against Everton.

However Costa recovered in time to start and found the net twice in a 6-3 victory for Jose Mourinho's side. 

No pressure: Del Bosque refused to blame Costa's absence on Chelsea, who want the striker fit for next week
