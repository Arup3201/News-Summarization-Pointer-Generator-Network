Tomas Berdych will face Andy Murray in the Australian Open semi-finals after a hugely impressive takedown of Rafael Nadal.

The 29-year-old Czech is the prospective Australian Open semi-final opponent for the winner of the Murray-Kyrgios clash after dismissing the world No 3 6-2, 6-0, 7-6 in two hours and 13 minutes.

That brings into play the fascinating prospect of Murray being pitted against his long-time friend and former coach Dani Vallverdu, who has taken over the lead role guiding perennial nearly man Berdych.

The 28-year-old Venezuelan had left the employ of Murray in November after nearly five years working together, a decision that he told Sportsmail last week was 'genuinely mutual'. Explaining that the relationship had 'run its course' he added: 'I will always be in Andy's corner, except when I am coaching against him.'

Afterwards a delighted Berdych praised his new mentor, saying: 'It has been going really well and I'm really happy with the way we are working together. He has given me a good plan and I'm sticking to it. 

Berdych started quickly and raced into a two-set lead dropping just two games on the way

'Rafa is a great fighter but I stayed focused and kept calm, I was ready for everything.'

Just how much impact he has made since they started working together last month – on the recommendation of Ivan Lendl – was evident in the way the Czech tackled his long-time nemesis Nadal, who he continually pushed way out of the court.

They had faced each other 21 times before this with Berdych winning only three. Nadal had won the previous seventeen, a remarkable streak going back nine years that included the 2010 Wimbledon final.

So there was going to be an enormous psychological hurdle to clear if he was going to dismiss the Spaniard and take advantage of his relative ring-rust coming into this event.

By finally managing to defeat him again he joined Jo Wilfried Tsonga as the only player to have beaten all of the 'Big Four' (Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Murray) in grand slam play.

It helped that Nadal was totally off his game in the most bizarre way during the first two sets, seemingly bereft of energy and losing his first 'bagel' set since 2011. However, he roused himself in the third to give Berdych's notoriously frail nerve a real test.

But the Czech, who last week became engaged to model Ester Satarova, kept up with those flatly struck groundstrokes executed with his easy power. After missing two match points at 6-5 in the third he went 5-1 up in the tiebreak, was pulled back to 5-4, but just about closed it out 7-5.

Should he face Murray then there will be some fascinating dynamics at work. But no extraneous factors will alter the fact that he has made it into the last four without dropping a set, so he will be very formidable and supremely confident.

As for Nadal, he clearly needs more matches under his belt – and will probably start getting them next month when he heads to clay court events in South America.

Nadal could be seen taking a tablet early in the third set but he denied, despite his early sluggishness, having any physical issues, saying it was ‘nothing important’.
