Arsene Wenger insists that new signing Mathieu Debuchy's attacking instincts are perfectly suited to Arsenal's style of play.

The former Newcastle defender finally completed a £10 million move to the Emirates where he will replace fellow Frenchman Bacary Sagna following his free transfer to Manchester City.

Wenger is confident that the France international will continue to progress following a successful spell on Tyneside - where he arrived in a £5 million deal from Lille in January 2013.

'The obvious replacement for Sagna was Debuchy. He knows what to 
expect and that's of course a huge advantage,' Wenger said on Arsenal 
Player.

'Debuchy is very good going forward, is very quick in transition.

'He is sharp in his marking, good with interceptions and quick to go from defence to attack.

'You feel he always has the desire to go forward, so I believe he will be perfectly suited to our style in that aspect.'

The 28-year-old became the Gunners' second major signing of the summer following the arrival of Barcelona and Chile forward Alexis Sanchez.

Debuchy is certain that the club is moving forward following their FA Cup triumph last season.

'I know that Arsenal can win titles every year. Winning the FA Cup 
last season was something magnificent, but I hope that it is just the 
beginning and that there will be more to come next season.

'There are some really great players in this team. We saw that last season and I think it will be even better this season.

'I hope there is more silverware to come in the next few years.'

Arsenal are still interested in bringing in more players as Wenger looks to construct a squad capable of putting in a  sustained challenge for the Premier League title.

Among the reported targets on Wenger's wishlist are a defensive midfielder and reserve goalkeeper - with Real Madrid's Sami Khedira and Colombia stopper David Ospina linked with possible moves
