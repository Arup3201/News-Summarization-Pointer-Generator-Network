When they found out they were working on the starting line of the 100 metre final, these volunteers won't have believed their luck - and boy did they show it when Usain Bolt and Co came on to the track in Stratford.

The volunteers were clearly trying to obey their instructions to be unassuming and stand in position waiting for their athlete's beckon call, but they struggled to contain themselves when presented by the impossibly cool Bolt and the other sprint stars.

Such was the magnitude of the event, and the grandiosity of the athletes before them, the volunteers can be seen catching each other's eyes to share their excitement that they are within feet of the fastest man who has ever lived as he readies himself to defend his Olympic crown.

All eyes on Bolt: A female volunteer (right) on the starting looked on in awe at Usain Bolt as he warmed up

Just one look: The volunteer appears to give bolt a quick up and down

Still looking: Bolt hands his stash to a volunteer as he is eagerly watched by another one

Bolt, meanwhile, is going through his usual pre-race schtick. A lot of bravado and bouncing around is interspersed with diligent warm-ups and drills as the young volunteers, and two billion others worldwide, look on awe-struck.

But who can blame them? The Games volunteers had the best view in the house ahead of Bolt smashing his own Olympic record last night.

The female volunteers can be seen staring at the sprinters, in particular Bolt, and then - stopping just short of giggling - look at one another, eyebrows aloft, to share their blatant joy.

At one point, when Bolt takes off his training jumper, one of the young women looks at him and struggles to force the smile from her face.

Bolt's personal volunteer - a young 
man who is beaming from ear to ear from the moment the Jamaican arrives 
on track - is lucky enough to receive the Jamaican's hat just seconds 
before he embarks on winning the gold.

Second best: Yohan Blake doesn't quite get the same attention as his compatriot

Can't believe your luck? The volunteers looked to be giddy at the thought they were just inches away from the fastest man ever

Shake it off: Bolt's warm-up was a mix of bouncing around the track and sprint drills

Bolt
leans in as he hands it to the volunteer and points as if cajoling him 
or making a joke before moves into position to race. 9.63secs later, 
Bolt had won the gold and beaten his own Olympic record. A cool customer
indeed.

The other sprinters, no slouches themselves, also seemed to have a hold on the young volunteers.

Yohan
Blake, who finished up in silver to his compatriot, was also subject to
star-stricken stares, as another of the volunteers looks on with an 
eagerness as he sets up his starting blocks.

Even
though the volunteers' primary purpose on track was simply to take the 
athletes' tracksuits, hats and iPods, this bunch seemed to be enjoying 
every minute of it.

Understandable
when put into a wider context, as each and every one will have quite 
the yarn to spin when asked: 'Where were you when Usain Bolt won gold at
London 2012?'

Not just Usain! Bolt's compatriot and silver medallist, Yohan Blake, was watched carefully as he organised himself ahead of the final

It wasn't just the final... Two volunteers are similarly entranced by Bolt before he ran in the semi-final heat

Good view? Three volunteers try to contain their excitement, and stop just short of giggling as Bolt warms up in front of them

Head and shoulders above: Bolt cruised to victory over his rivals in the final with a time of 9.63secs, a new Olympic record
