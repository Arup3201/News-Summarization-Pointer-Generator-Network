Michael Carrick was named among the Manchester United substitutes for their trip to West Brom on Monday night after making a quicker than expected recovery from an ankle injury.

Sportsmail revealed earlier in the day that the 33-year-old was in Louis van Gaal's side for their Premier League clash at The Hawthorns, although he remained an unused substitute as his side battled to a 2-2 draw.

Carrick has missed the entire season so far but United medical staff have been pleased with the speed of the midfielder's recovery.

Van Gaal is eager to get the former Spurs player back on the pitch given Carrick's experience.

United may prefer to give Carrick a run out for the Under 21s against West Ham later this week before reintroducing him to senior action.

Young winger Adnan Januzaj - who has featured in five league games thus far - was named in the starting XI for the game at The Hawthorns.
