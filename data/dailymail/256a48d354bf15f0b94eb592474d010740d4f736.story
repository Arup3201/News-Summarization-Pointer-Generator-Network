A boom in motherhood among older women has driven up the number of pregnancies to record levels, official figures revealed yesterday.

For the first time, more than 900,000 women became pregnant in a year, a level not reached even during the baby boom years after World War Two.

The unprecedented number of conceptions was fuelled by the fast-rising rates of pregnancy among women in their 30s  and 40s.

The latest figures show that 40-somethings were becoming pregnant in  2010 at more than double the rate of two decades ago.

The baby boom is being fuelled by more and more older women getting pregnant

In a single year, conception rates for women in this age group rose by 5.2 per cent.

The increase for those aged 34 to 39 was 4.5 per cent and 4.9 per cent for those aged 30 to 34.

The Office for National Statistics said the latest leap was down to the race among working women to catch up and have the families they missed out on in their 20s.

This is a new influence in addition to the factors driving rates in recent years: high immigration and the arrival in Britain of large numbers of women of child-bearing age who then have families.

Many women may also be influenced by the recession making family life more important. Newly jobless women and those with less work also have more time for family.

The report said the rise in numbers of conceptions ‘could be attributed to the increased contribution of women aged 30 and over, or possibly due to the economic climate following the 2008-2009 recession.

‘Family may also be valued more highly during tough economic times and, as parents could be out of work, they may have more time to spend on child rearing.’

No longer nuclear family: The data also showed that most babies are now conceived outside marriage

The ONS said the reasons for more 
over-40s conceiving include delaying motherhood by participating in 
higher education, holding off on marriage and the desire to get ahead in
their careers to buy a home and be financially secure before starting a
family.

Migrants who were not in Britain in their early child-bearing years have
also boosted levels by becoming mothers later in life, said the report.

According to the 2010 figures, 909,245 women in England and Wales became
pregnant. This was a rise of 1.4 per cent on the 896,466 pregnancies in
the previous year.

There were 723,165 babies born with the average age for new mothers now almost 30.

Just over one in five of the pregnancies, slightly fewer than 190,000, 
ended in abortion. Half of conceptions to girls under 18 ended in 
terminations.

There have not been so many pregnancies in England and Wales before.
Numbers have never reached 900,000 since the 1967 Abortion Act came into operation, legalising terminations.

The baby boom peaked in 1964, when there were 880,173 maternities, which
are comparable to conceptions now. In the post-war year of 1947, there 
were 891,504 maternities.

According to the latest figures, conception rates for women in their 20s remained flat.

Those in their early 30s were the least probable to have an abortion, 
with 12.6 cent of pregnancies among 30 to 34-year-olds terminated in 
2010.

This is the age group where they are most likely to marry and  settle down.

Decline: The number of teenage girls falling pregnant in England and Wales, has reached its lowest level since 1969 - but failed to meet Labour targets

Tony Blair’s attempt to slash teenage pregnancies by handing out contraceptives and more sex education did not hit its target.

Labour’s flagship strategy costing £250million had aimed to halve conceptions in England by 2010. But official figures yesterday showed the 12-year plan only cut the numbers of conceptions to the under-18s by 23.8 per cent.

For 2010 alone, however, under-18 pregnancies did drop by 7.3 per cent. Pregnancies among the under-16s also fell, by 6.8 per cent in a year to 2010. This meant 36 girls in every 1,000 aged 15 to 17 became pregnant.

The Office for National Statistics said policies, including sex education and the availability of contraceptives, could explain the fall.

But it said there could also be ‘a shift in aspirations of young women towards education’.

There was more media awareness among young people and ‘the perception of stigma associated with being a teenage mother’.

Diane Abbott, Shadow Public Health Minister, warned that Coalition reforms would reverse Labour’s good work before 2010.

She said: ‘The danger is that this government will cause the fragmentation of sexual health services.’
