It is a full two and a half centuries since the fourth Earl of Sandwich is said to have demanded his hunk of meat be brought to him between two doorstop wedges of bread so he needn't take a break from gambling.

His accidental invention, reported to have been the result of his wish to avoid gravy dripping onto his hands, was purportedly picked up by his gambling pals - I'll have the same as Sandwich!' - and the sandwich was born.

The bread-based snack has since become one of Britain's most popular and enduring culinary creations, and forms the backbone of many a lunchbreak.

Celebrating the sandwich: Tesco is marking 250 years of the nation's favourite bread-based snack with a Yorkshire pudding wrap

Thanks to its versatility, the potential permutations of the bread-based snack are endless.

And this week, to celebrate 250 years of the sandwich, Tesco has launched a new sandwich range, Best Of British, celebrating Britain's most iconic foods and paying homage to the sandwich, which the store says is 'one of Britain's most famous contributions to world cuisine.

Whether or not these combinations will elevate our global culinary status any higher is a matter of personal taste.

The collection includes such delights as the Yorkshire pudding wrap, complete with British topside beef, roast potato and horseradish sauce.

Thinking outside the (lunch)box: The Fourth Earl of Sandwich, 1718-1792, is said to have invented the sandwich when he instructed his kitchen staff to bring him his meat between two slices of bread so he could continue gambling

Or another, perhaps best left to the iron-stomached: the Scotch egg sandwich, stuffed with slices of haslet pork, free range egg and pickle.

Joining Tesco on the Jubilee bandwagon is Gregg's, who plan to design a British-themed sandwich for every month of this anniversary year.

An ardent gambler, the 4th Earl of 
Sandwich refused to break from his games to dine formally. Instead, so 
legend has it, he demanded his kitchen staff bring him slabs of beef 
between hunks of bread, so that he might eat it without dripping gravy 
on his cards.

His 
gambling chums, all eager to emulate their esteemed host, adopted the 
same habit, and when the Earl ordered his snack, they would shout 'The 
same as Sandwich!', and thus, the story goes, the sandwich was born.

A
less colourful version of the tale is expounded in the Earl of 
Sandwich's biography, by N.A.M. Rodger. He suggests that Sandwich, a 
hardworking member of the military who was heavily involved with the 
political world and the arts, is more likely to have eaten the 
sandwiches at his desk.

First up for May is their Beef and Horseradish Oval Bite, which they say is made up of 'succulent beef, horseradish and caramelised red onion chutney with spinach on an oval bite,' which roughly translates a beef sandwich on funny-shaped bread.

Martin Kibler, Trading and Marketing Director at Greggs, said: 'A good sandwich still gets our tastebuds excited and is more often than not the thing we turn to when in need of a satisfying snack. This this is why it has remained so important to our food culture for so many years.

'As a business, we’ve been baking bread since the 1930s when our founder John Gregg started to deliver bread to the people of Newcastle.

We know more than most about the importance of quality ingredients and how to make a great sandwich.

Tesco sandwich buyer Debbie Allwright added: 'Britain has a fantastic culinary history that we wanted to celebrate with our greatest food creation of all - the humble sandwich.

'We know that this summer there will be a big appetite for heritage foods and we wanted to celebrate some of these in a new and tasty way.

'Millions of people look forward to eating Yorkshire pudding as part of their Sunday roast.

'Now they’ll be able to pick one up anytime they like in the form of a wrap.'

Tesco has become well known for its sandwich innovations. This new range follows the strawberry and cream sandwich, created last year to celebrate Wimbledon fortnight, and the lasagna sandwich in 2010.
