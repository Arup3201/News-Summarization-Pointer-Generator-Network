A coroner warned cocaine use has become too common among young people after hearing a teenager killed herself and a friend in a road crash while high on the drug.

An inquest heard Miss Jarvis and her best friend Sian Davies, 21, had taken a cocktail of alcohol and cocaine at an all-night party.

They left before dawn to drive home to their village - but their silver Vauxhall Corsa crashed into a stone bridge at almost twice the speed limit.

Coroner Dewi Pritchard Jones said: 'The message here is that drugs kill.

'It is clear both people in the car had been drinking and consuming drugs and I am satisfied they were well and truly high.

The coroner recorded a verdict of unlawful killing on Miss Davies, of Pentir, and accidental death for Miss Jarvis, of Llanberis (general file shot pictured)

'In recent years we are coming across drugs more and more often. In cases involving young people it’s a rarity for us not to find any drugs.

'And it’s a sad reflection that the use of drugs - especially cocaine - has become so common.'

The two friends had left the boozy party in the early hours of New Year’s Day to drive to their home in neighbouring villages in North Wales.

The inquest heard Miss Jarvis would have faced criminal proceedings if they had survived the crash.

North Wales Coroner Mr Pritchard said: 'The driver owes a duty of care to any passenger.

'The level of drugs and alcohol leads me to the opinion there would have been evidence for a charge of causing death by dangerous driving.'

Miss Jarvis who was not wearing a seat belt at the time suffered fatal spine and head injuries.

Miss Davies, who died of head injuries, was under the drink drive limit but tests showed she had also taken cocaine.

The inquest in Caernarfon heard Miss Jarvis was 'snaking across the road' at between 50 and 60mph when it crashed in a 30mph zone.

The coroner recorded a verdict of unlawful killing on Miss Davies, of Pentir, and accidental death for Miss Jarvis, of Llanberis.

Speaking after the inquest Miss Davies’s parents said: 'We are devastated and heartbroken by her death.

'We were blessed to have known Sian, she touched and enriched many lives, she will be forever in our hearts.'
