A Texas man who became the first person in the U.S. to receive a full face transplant recipient got married on Saturday to another burn patient that he met at a support group.

Dallas Wiens, of Fort Worth, was severely injured in a bizarre construction accident in 2008 when he came into contact with a high-voltage power line.

Jamie Nash, of Garland, nearly died in a car crash in Ennis in 2010. Her car erupted in flames, and she was trapped. She was severely burned on her hands, back and legs.

About 200 people attended the wedding at Ridglea Baptist Church, including doctors and nurses who had treated the couple

The couple, who got engaged last fall, exchanged vows Saturday morning at the Fort Worth church where Wiens was working when he was critically hurt.

‘I am blessed beyond measure that you have chosen me, and I love you with all of my heart,’ Wiens told Nash, reports The Dallas Morning News.

Pastor Scott Cox says about 200 people attended the wedding at Ridglea Baptist Church, including doctors and nurses who had treated the couple.

Cox says the couple told him they believe God brought them together.

Wiens was painting the church in 2008 when he touched a power line. He suffered facial injuries and was blinded. In 2011 he underwent a full facial transplant at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

Nash, 29, was burned over 70 percent of her 
body in a one-car wreck in June 2010. Today she speaks at schools and 
churches about the perils of texting while driving.

The couple met in a support group at Parkland Hospital, where both were being treated.

Wiens was walked down the aisle with his grandfather, Del Peterson of Fort Worth.

A retired banker, Peterson accompanied Dallas through much of his recovery, including multiple flights to Boston.

‘He’s marrying someone who can share about their pain that they’ve gone through, and their recoveries,’ said Sue Peterson, Del’s wife. Until recently, Wiens lived with the Petersons.

‘They have fantastic attitudes about why they’re where they are.’

Escorted by her father, Nash wore a chiffon gown with a pink-lace bodice, off-shoulder sleeves and a plunging back that revealed the scars from her accident.

‘Things happened that I didn’t think ever could be possible for me, and you made them possible,’ Nash said. ‘You gave me hope, and you gave me tender love that I will always treasure.’

The wedding was followed by a reception at the Flying Saucer in downtown Fort Worth, where the couple made their entrance to Bruno Mars’ hit Just the Way You Are.

The couple met in a support group for burn victims and started dating a couple of months later

Guests included church friends and people who’ve assisted Wiens and Nash in their respective recoveries, including Parkland staff.

‘I think their confidence in their healing process and getting better just made them a perfect match,’ said Ethan Gloger, a clerk in Parkland’s burn unit.Wiens' features burned away and he was left blind

Win's facial features were burned away and he was left blind after his head touched a high-voltage power line while painting the Ridglea Baptist Church in November 2008.

He received a new nose, lips, skin, muscle and nerves from an anonymous donor, and has had more than 38 surgeries.

However the transplant, which was paid for by the U.S. military, was
unable to restore his sight, and some nerves were so badly damaged from
his injury that he has partial sensation on his left cheek and the left
side of his forehead.

Describing the first moment she locked eyes on him at the Parkland Hospital in Dallas, Nash said: 'I just looked at him from across the room, and there 
was something about him'.

This is the second marriage for both 
Wiens and Nash. He has a 5-year-old daughter, Scarlette. Her children are 10-year-old Samantha and 6-year-old Lucas.

Wiens,
who was previously married but filed for divorce before his accident in
November 2008, said he wasn't interested in getting into a relationship
at first.

'I had sworn off love and relationships,' he said. 'I had no desire to be in one whatsoever.'

Then, on Christmas Eve, they talked all night and set up a date.

'We went to dinner and a movie, and that's all she wrote,' he said.

The two said they have been together every day since.

All in the past: The couple are planning to tie the knot at the Ridglea Baptist Church in Fort Worth, where Wiens' horrific electrical accident took place four years ago

'I told him it's got to be love, because I'm not sick of you,' Nash joked. 'I know I've never felt more real than this.'

The couple plans to put their pasts behind them.

'There's no reason to dwell on the past,' he said.

'It's dead and gone,' she added. 'It burned in the fire.'

They said they make the perfect couple and help balance each other.

Her hands, for example, were severely injured in her accident. His are fine.

She can see. He lost his eyesight in the accident.

'It's a story of hope, a story of 
true survivors,' Nash said. 'I mean, if we can do it, I guarantee you, 
anybody out there - we all have a story.

'We're all going through 
something. And I want to give everybody hope.'
