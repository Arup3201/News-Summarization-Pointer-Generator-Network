As one of Britain's best-known musical landmarks, it attracts tens of thousands of fans every year.

But now, The Beatles' Abbey Road zebra crossing could have an additional visitor - a lollipop lady.

The employee would protect fans trying to recreate the famous 1969 album cover shot at the crossing in St John's Wood, London.

Protection: The crossing could soon feature a lollipop lady to protect fans trying to recreate the iconic image

It comes just a day after hundreds of people descended on Abbey Road to celebrate 45 years since the rock band was photographed there.

Today, Westminster Council said it was concerned about the safety of the 'thousands and thousands' of people who flock to the crossing every year to recreate the iconic image.

In some cases, fans are putting themselves at risk of drivers who often struggle to make it 
over the crossing because of the constant stream of pedestrians, it said.

Meanwhile, buses carrying tourists can also cause traffic chaos by double-parking or parking on yellow lines.

A council spokesman said it is currently discussing
 options to manage the busy traffic flow, including the possibility of 
employing a lollipop lady or man.

'Safety concerns at the crossing are being discussed and we are looking at the options,' he said.

Abbey
 Road zebra crossing in St John's Wood, London, rose to fame after The 
Beatles posed on it for the cover of their eleventh studio album, titled
 'Abbey Road, in 1969.

The
 image, shot by Iain Macmillan, shows John Lennon, Paul McCartney, 
George Harrison and Ringo Starr walking over the crossing.

Since then, hundreds of thousands of tourists have flocked to Abbey Road to recreate the iconic image.

In December 2010, the crossing given Grade II-listed status for its 'cultural and 
historical importance'.

'We're looking at what the best thing is to do. The council is, to some extent, responsible for keeping people safe.'

Westminster City councillor Lindsey Hall added that the crossing, made famous by band members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, has always caused a problem.

'It's
 a residential area and it's not geared to receiving thousands and 
thousands of people - so it's quite hard to get some tangible 
solutions,' she told The Daily Mirror.

'Obviously we don't want to be spoilsports, we are really proud of our musical heritage.

'I've
 seen huge double-decker buses parking on double yellow lines right 
outside the studio, causing total chaos to traffic and causing danger to
 people trying to get their photograph.

'It would be good to have somebody there permanently.'

Local cafe owner Richard Porter added: 'You get silly people standing on the crossing for ages.'
