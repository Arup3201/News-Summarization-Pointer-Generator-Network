A Virginia county has 
voted to demolish a building and parking garage that houses one of the 
most historic journalism sites of the past 50 years.

The Washington Post reports the Arlington County Board voted unanimously Saturday to 
allow for demolition of the parking garage where FBI official Mark Felt 
met secretly with Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward during the 
Watergate investigation.

Felt was known for decades as Woodward's source 'Deep Throat.'

Monday Properties plans to 
replace its two 12-story buildings in Rosslyn with a 28-story 
residential tower and a 24-story commercial building.

'This is a terrific project,” said County Board Chairman Jay Fisette. 'Don’t forget it’s bringing residents to Rosslyn, a grocery store . . . a
 beautiful park . . . and substantial community benefits, including 
$8 million for affordable housing, which will build far more units in 
our community than if they had been [built] on site.'

The project will also put 513,004 square feet of office space and 11,131 square feet of ground floor retail space to the area.

There will also be direct access to a grocery store via a two-level parking lot.

The existing 
buildings will be razed no sooner than January 2017.

The
 county plans to save a historical marker it installed in 2011, and the 
landowner pledges to create a memorial to the Watergate history.
