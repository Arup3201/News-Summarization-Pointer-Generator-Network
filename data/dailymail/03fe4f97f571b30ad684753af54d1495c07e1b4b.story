She's inspired everything from books to phone covers, and now a collection of paintings, photos and sculptures made with Kate Moss in mind is to be auctioned at Christie's.

And the stunning images certainly seem to have the 39-year-old model's seal of approval. She was photographed with a big smile on her face at the auction house, where she unveiled Kate Moss: The Collection ahead of the public exhibition and sale later this month.

Moss, who plumped for a typically daring silver trouser suit, looked confident she posed for photos with the exhibits before enjoying a tour.

Among the pieces in the exhibition is a striking porcelain sculpture by Nick Knight which depicts the Croydon-born model as an angel and an incredibly detailed tapestry portrait created by American artist Chuck Close.

Also included in the sale, which will take place on the 25th September, are stunning photographic portraits by Craig McDean and Chris Levine.

Triptych: This work is by Erique Badelscue, named Swim Tulum, was taken in 1994

Levine's work, entitled She's Laser, portrays the model topless with lasers beamed onto her body, the coloured light giving the piece a pop art feel.

Another striking image is Allen Jones' Body Armour, expected to sell for around £20,000, which shows the model sporting glittering gold body armour.

Angelic: Nick Knight's work, Porcelain Kate, is expected to fetch £35,000 when it goes under the hammer

All the works come from the private collection of Gert Elfering, 50, a Munich millionaire who, according to Forbes, made his money by promoting lotteries on television.

Elfering, who described Moss as the 'ultimate modern muse' is set to add a considerable amount to his fortune following the auction, with many of the works valued in the tens of thousands.

Levine's laser effort has the highest estimate, at £150,000, while the lowest sale price expected is £6000 for photographer Bruce Weber's 1997 portrait of the model on a beach in Florida.

Last year, the auction house had global auction and private sales in the first half of 2013 that totalled £2.4 billion

Top billing: Chris Levine's She's Light, Laser 3 has the highest estimate with bids of £150,000 expected

Striking: Allen Jones's iconic Body Armour is expected to bring in around £30,000 for Elfering

Beautiful: The late Herb Ritts' Kate Moss 1 was taken in Malibu in 1994 and has an estimate of £8000

'I am pleased to be working with Christie‟s once again, on this occasion to celebrate the living icon Kate Moss,' said Elfering.

'She is the subject and inspiration for this collection, but the importance of the present works is in her collaboration with the internationally renowned artists who created them.

Philippe Garner, Christie's director of photographs, added: 'Kate Moss – From the Collection of Gert Elfering is a very special event at Christie's this autumn.'

The works can be viewed at Christie's between the 21st and 24th September. The auction takes place on the 25th. See christies.com for more information.
