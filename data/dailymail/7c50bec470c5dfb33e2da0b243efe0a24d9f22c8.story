The fiancee of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez has left a closed-court hearing on a petition to grant her immunity in Hernandez's upcoming murder trial without commenting.

Shayanna Jenkins went before the judge Wednesday on a prosecutors' petition to grant her immunity in the case.

Jenkins' lawyer, Janice Bassil, refused comment.

The state has also petitioned to grant immunity to a second, unidentified witness.

Lawyer E. Peter Parker said outside court he was representing a party in the petition. Leaving the courtroom with the woman, Parker said he would not comment because the matter was under seal. He didn't identify the woman. Parker represented Hernandez's cousin Tanya Singleton.

Jenkins is charged with perjury for allegedly lying to a grand jury investigating the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, who was found shot to death in an industrial park near Hernandez and Jenkins' North Attleborough home.

This as it was determined on Tuesday that prosecutors won't be permitted to cover up a trophy case in Aaron Hernandez's home when jurors visit it during the former New England Patriots star's murder trial, a judge ruled Tuesday.

Assistant District Attorney William McCauley had sought to have the case hidden, saying the defense wanted "to get the benefit of having the jury be impressed by trophies or medals."

Prosecutors also cited the O.J. Simpson murder trial in arguing that they wanted to avoid what they called 'strategic manipulation' of the home. In the Simpson case, photographs and pictures were placed in the home to portray the defendant as a family man, and a Bible was placed on a table to play to jurors' religious sympathies, prosecutors said in a court filing. 

Jury selection is set to begin Friday for Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty to killing Lloyd, a semiprofessional football player.

Hernandez was a tight end for the Patriots with a $40 million contract when prosecutors say he killed Lloyd in an industrial park near his North Attleborough home in June 2013.

Lloyd, 27, was dating the sister of Jenkins.

Hernandez also has pleaded not guilty in the fatal shootings of two men in 2012 after an encounter at a Boston nightclub.

That case has not yet gone to trial. 

The judge indicated there may also be another hearing Thursday before jury selection begins.

The trial is expected to last six to 10 weeks, and dozens of witnesses could be called, including Patriots coach Bill Belichick and team owner Robert Kraft.
