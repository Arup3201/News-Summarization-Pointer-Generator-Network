David Cameron’s pledge to spend billions more on foreign aid has come in for a withering attack from a sacked minister – who said he did not know a single rank-and-file Conservative who backed it.

Gerald Howarth, a defence minister until the reshuffle, urged the Prime Minister to scrap the ‘arbitrary’ target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid by 2013, and said it was only being imposed to mollify Lib Dems.

He said it was time to ‘reorder the priorities’ and divert the money saved into the defence budget, warning that savage cuts to spending on the Armed Forces were having a dangerous effect on Britain’s influence in the world.

The aid budget is set to rise by 32.6 per cent between 2011/12 and 2014/15, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, while the budget for the Ministry of Defence is set for a 19.5 per cent cut.

Mr Howarth’s scathing criticism came as Mr Cameron made a speech to the United Nations in New York in which he promised that Britain would stick to its pledge, calling it ‘morally right’.

The Prime Minister said: ‘To those who are sceptical, I would say it is not only a moral obligation that the better-off countries have to tackle poverty in our world … but it’s also in our interests that we build a more prosperous world.’

Globally, Britain is ranked sixth in terms of aid spending as a percentage of national income, far ahead of other G8 nations such as France, Germany and the US.

The only countries meeting the 0.7 per cent target are Norway, Luxembourg, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. Britain is on 0.56 per cent at present, but plans to meet the target next year.

This will see the aid budget increase from £7billion at the last election to £12billion – costing each household more than £300 a year.

Britain contributes some of this to a European development aid budget which spends half its funds on middle and higher income nations.

Former defence minister Gerald Howarth (left) urged the Prime Minister to scrap the target to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid by 2013, saying it was only being imposed to mollify Lib Dems.

It has previously handed £1.8million to Barbados to build the PomMarine hotel, where youngsters will be trained in hospitality management.

Mr Howarth said: ‘Most people in this country will think that 0.7 per cent is a somewhat arbitrary figure, and certainly I have not yet met a Conservative outside the immediate confines of the Government who believes that it’s right to ring-fence overseas aid and to cut our Armed Forces.’

He told the Daily Mail that while he did not want to scrap overseas aid, he took issue with the level of spending at a time of defence cuts.

‘I haven’t met any rank-and-file Conservative who thinks this is the right order of priorities,’ he said. ‘The target is consistent with the strategy before the election which was to woo Liberal waverers. I said that was mistaken politically from the outset.

‘It is a matter of major concern to most Conservatives that we are continuing to increase our aid spending up to this entirely arbitrary limit, at the same time as a large number of countries … have refused to sign up.’

Mr Howarth, MP for Aldershot, said 
Britain had ‘given leadership’ on international aid, but the 
increasingly dangerous world means it was now time to ‘reorder the 
priorities’.

Mr Howarth told the BBC that cutting defence would affect Britain’s influence in the world. He said: ‘If you are able to carry a big stick, you can speak softly. And we have certainly had to trim our stick.

‘I believe that countries round the world do look to us and say: “Are you a serious player?”.’

Lord Lawson, the former Tory Chancellor, also laid into Mr Cameron’s 0.7 per cent target.

‘It is plucked from a United Nations sponsored arrangement in 1970,’ he told Newsnight. ‘It had no rhyme or reason. Most countries now don’t bother about it at all.’

But Therese Coffey, a ministerial aide in the Department for Business, attacked Mr Howarth’s comments on Twitter.

She wrote: ‘[He] needs to meet a few more Conservative MPs. Show of hands at pre-Budget backbench meeting was overwhelming for aid.’
