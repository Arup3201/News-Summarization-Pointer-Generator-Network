The number of private sector workers saving into a company pension has collapsed to 2.7million, the lowest level since records began in 1953, official figures revealed yesterday.

The statistics expose the rapid destruction of pension saving in Britain, with a drop of 200,000 in the last year alone.

The Office for National Statistics figures mean that, with a private sector workforce of 24.2million, only 11.2 per cent of private sector workers are actively saving into a company pension scheme.

In 1967 – the year that pension saving among private sector workers peaked – the figure was 8.1million, equal to 81 per cent of a private sector workforce of ten million, according to the ONS.

The decline is forcing a generation to work-till-they-drop. A record-breaking number are working beyond state pension age.  

Yesterday the pensions minister said the shocking figures highlight the importance of ‘crucial’ reforms, which force bosses to pay into a pension for their workers.

In the public sector, the situation is very different. Of the 5.7million state workers, who have been nicknamed ‘the pensions aristocracy’, 5.1million, or 89.5 per cent, are members of an occupational pension scheme.

Recent changes, making them pay more into
their pensions and to retire later, have triggered strikes, including 
this week’s four-hour walkout by firemen.

But they still enjoy the most generous type of pension, known as a ‘defined benefit’ scheme.

These schemes promise to pay workers a percentage of their final salary, or an average of their salary over their career, when they retire.

But this generous and guaranteed type of pension is almost extinct in the private sector.

There, workers are being put into ‘defined contribution’ schemes, which make no guarantees about the size of a pension at retirement, with bosses typically paying far less into the scheme.

Since 2000, the number of private sector workers with a gold-plated ‘defined benefit’ pension has crashed from 4.6million to only 1.7million, and is expected to keep falling.

This means that of the 6.8million workers who are paying into a ‘defined benefit’ pension, three-quarters work in the public sector.

More than half of homeowners  aged 50 or over plan to use their property to pay for their retirement, a study says.

They are known as the ‘home is pension’ generation, or ‘hippies’.

Last year, only 28 per cent of homeowners in this age group who are still working said they planned to rely on their homes as their pension, but this has almost doubled to 52 per cent this year, according to the study from insurance firm LV=.

On average, their home is worth £258,000.

Their options include downsizing to a smaller property or taking out an equity release loan, which ‘releases’ cash from their home.

It is only paid back when they die. The study, of 1,014 homeowners, is further evidence of the pensions crisis.

The Government is trying to end the pensions crisis by making all bosses pay into a pension for their workers, and requiring them to sign up their workers to a scheme.

New rules mean that over the next five years all workers aged between 22 and state pension age who earn more than £9,440 are being ‘automatically enrolled’ into a scheme.

Yesterday’s ONS figures do not include the impact of automatic enrolment because the figures relate to April. The automatic enrolment rules did not begin until October.

Around 1.6million have been automatically enrolled since October, according to the Department for Work and Pensions. Fewer than 10 per cent are believed to have ‘opted out’.

Pensions minister Steve Webb said: ‘The scale of the challenge is clear. Too few people are saving for their retirement, which is why our pension reforms are so crucial.’

The collapse of pensions in the private sector was kick-started by Gordon Brown’s raid in his first Budget as Chancellor in 1997.

He abolished the tax credit that pension funds could claim from the Treasury on dividends. It is estimated to have cost them £6billion a year ever since.
