An inebriated 22-year-old Frenchman tried to resuscitate a rubber dinghy he had mistaken for a drowning person.

Officers found the man kneeling by an inflatable boat in a shipyard in Vannes, in Brittany near a string of nightclubs and went to investigate. 

'He was underneath a boat, on his knees, trying to resuscitate a rubber dinghy,' police told Le Télégramme de Brest newspaper.

Police took the young Frenchman to prison to sleep off his hangover and recover his senses 

The man told officers someone was unconscious inside the vessel. 

He reportedly told them the man 'isn't moving, doesn't reply and must be saved'. 

But on closer inspection, officers discovered the man was in fact performing CPR on the inflatable boat itself.

To make matters worse, he had already called out firefighters to the scene - an emergency call that the police swiftly cancelled.
