One day he will be king – yet the Prince of Wales on his fifth birthday was more keen on playing one of the most famous outlaws of all time.

Smiling at the camera, bow in one hand, he is a Robin Hood ready to take on the world. True, he doesn't have his band of merry men with him but at least he could count on his little sister, the Princess Royal, a fairy accomplice with magic wand.

These pictures, exclusively published in today’s Mail on Sunday, have never been seen publicly before. Taken in 1953, they are about to go on display for the first time as part of Buckingham Palace’s summer exhibition, Royal Childhood.

Charles had two birthday parties – the first at Windsor Castle with his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, and aunt, Princess Margaret, while his parents were at a Sandringham shooting party. The Queen and Prince Philip threw a second birthday party for him three days later at Buckingham Palace.

An adoring Anne was ever by her brother’s side, as the remaining three images reveal. Taken in December of that year, they show Charles cutting a cake decorated with Father Christmas, jumping out of a box – to his sister’s delight – and playing with his new cart (the toy horse is just out of sight).

The pair also adored Charles’s red model motor car, which travelled at 8mph, a birthday gift from his parents. In addition, the prince received an electronic dog from General Alfred Gruenther, then Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, which obeyed commands.

The photographs were taken by Jack Wallace Heaton from Wallace Heaton, the most famous photo and camera shop in the world during the 1950s and 1960s. It was eventually taken over by Dixons.

Mr Wallace Heaton's son Michael said: ‘My grandfather’s firm, Wallace Heaton, gave the then Princess Elizabeth a camera as a wedding present – I think it was a Rolleiflex – and my dad taught her to take photographs.

‘As a result of that, he got to know the princess very well. He ended up photographing Prince Charles on his way to the Coronation, at his two birthday parties and in a sailor suit.

‘I remember going with my dad to the Royal Tournament at Earls Court and she was also at the performance. Afterwards we all gathered around as she was going to make an appearance – the Queen saw my dad and smiled at him. That memory has lived with me to this day.’

The Queen first became interested in photography after her wedding to Prince Philip on November 20, 1947, when Wallace Heaton Ltd sent her a Rolleiflex camera. In a thank-you letter to the directors, management and staff, typed on Buckingham Palace paper and dated December 27, she wrote: ‘It is, I can assure them, a most welcome present and one which I really value.’

But after she started having lessons with Heaton, she began sending him handwritten memos. On January 30, 1951, she sent a note, signed with her initial ‘E’ and enclosing five films for developing. ‘Your criticisms are very helpful,’ she wrote. ‘I cannot quite understand why some of the shots are wrongly exposed but it may be from changing the lens and forgetting to alter the exposure when filming in slow motion.’

As well as the photographs and costume, the Royal Childhood exhibition has 23 outfits displayed on mannequins and a number of smaller dresses. There is a dressing-up outfit belonging to Queen Victoria’s son Prince Alfred and a photograph of the Queen, then Princess Elizabeth, and Princess Margaret in a 1941 performance of Cinderella.

Anna Reynolds, the curator, said: ‘This exhibition emphasises the universality of childhood. Queen Victoria’s children would often put on a Christmas tableau for their family and there are lots of photos of them dressing up.

‘It is a tradition that continued into the 20th Century with the Queen and Princess Margaret. We also see the Royal Family dressing up for children’s birthday parties. ’
