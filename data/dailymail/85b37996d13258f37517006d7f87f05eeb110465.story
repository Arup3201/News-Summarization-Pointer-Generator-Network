It was a long 12 years of campaigning for advocates of the sinking of the former naval warship ex-HMAS Adelaide.

But three years since the ship was scuttled tourism operators say it has turned the site into a must-visit shipwreck for divers and boosted the tourism industry on the NSW Central Coast.

Central Coast Tourism says just under 11,000 diving permits have been used on the ship since it was sunk in April 2011, and event watched by thousands of people from Avoca Beach near Terrigal.

The site has become a mecca for diving enthusiasts

One of two operators licensed to conduct dives on the warship, Terrigal Dive Centre owner Les Graham, said the wreck had increased ocean biomass and employment in the area.

'The wreck is superb, it's done everything we've said it would do,' Mr Graham, 72, said.

'The marine life on it is fantastic, it started getting marine life on it within months of appearing on the bottom of the ocean.'

When I look at it and look at what our local reefs look like I reckon were looking at what our local reefs must have looked like 100 years ago.'

Central Coast Tourism chief Robyne Abernethy said: 'From a tourism perspective the creation of the ex-HMAS Adelaide Reserve has been a good outcome for the local visitor economy by adding to our destination appeal and driving a niche visitor market.'

Mr Graham, who has owned the Terrigal dive shop for 46 years, operates four dives per day on weekends and about two dives per day on weekdays.

In order to explore the shipwreck beginners must do a four-to-five day diving course.

They then must complete an advanced adventurer course over two days.

When people embark on their dive, they descend down the mast to the 02 deck where they can swim around and see fish and soft coral.

They can then swim forward a short way to go inside the wheel house.

There is plenty of marine like to look at including fish and soft coral

Divers can takes photos sitting in the captain's chair and enjoy looking out at the marine life.

Diving operator Bob Diaz, who owns Pro-Dive Central Coast, said: 'It's like sitting inside the aquarium and looking at all the fish swimming around.'

Divers can then swim down the foredeck, all the way up to the bow.

Mr Diaz said divers have seen dolphins, seals and even whales swim in and around the former warship.

The amount of divers visiting the area has quadrupled since the ship was scuttled, locals say

He added that the amount of divers visiting the area has quadrupled since the ship was scuttled.

When the ship first sank it was 18 metres to the top of the ocean. 

But the ship has since sunk to 22 metres, putting it just outside the range for people who have only done the initial dive course.

'Which is a pity, it would have been nice if it had stayed at 18 and we could have just accepted everyone,' Mr Graham said.

Mr Graham said divers love exploring the ship's five decks, and especially enjoy taking photos sitting in the captain's chair.

The local tourism industry, lead by a group called the Central Coast Artificial Reef Project, campaigned for 12 years to have the warship sunk.

Before the ship was due to be scuttled in 2010 a local environmental group called the No Ships Action Group, concerned about the impact the ship would have on local marine life, won a court injunction against the scuttling.

This was eventually thrown out of court but it delayed the sinking of the ship by a year.

The ex-HMAS Adelaide was given to the state government and it had to be cleaned and stripped in cooperation with the state and federal Environmental Protection Authority.

Crown Lands, a NSW government body, is responsible for the ship’s ongoing maintenance.

The ship participated in the Gulf War and in peacekeeping operations in East Timor
