It's a new series that follows the fortunes of a group of senior executives as the BBC lurches from one crisis to another.

But this is no fly-on-the-wall documentary showing how the Corporation is trying to tackle its problems: this is a comedy that makes light of a series of scandals that have cost licence fee payers millions of pounds.

In one episode, real BBC executive Alan Yentob makes a cameo appearance, where he is seen arm-wrestling with novelist Salman Rushdie.

Executive decision: Hugh Bonneville, centre, a BBC official Ian Fletcher in the forthcoming comedy W1A

W1A, which will be broadcast later this month, stars Downton Abbey’s Hugh Bonneville, and several of the characters and storylines bear a striking similarity to real people and events.

Bonneville plays Ian Fletcher, who has been hired to chart a new course for the BBC in light of what are described as ‘recent learning opportunities’.

These ‘opportunities’ seem to be an obvious reference to the crises which continue to engulf the publicly funded broadcaster .  .  .

THE COMEDY: Staff are forced  to rely on a new IT system called Syncopatico. It is meant to revolutionise life,  – but actually  it doesn’t work.

THE REALITY: In April 2013 the BBC scrapped its state-of-the-art ‘Digital Media Initiative’ at a  cost to licence fee payers of  £100 million.

Spending watchdog the National Audit Office subsequently accused the Corporation’s senior executives of losing ‘their grip’ on the system.

THE COMEDY: The Corporation is thrown into crisis when  Sally Wingate, a veteran presenter on the regional programme Spotlight South West, claims her career has  been held back because of the broadcaster’s institutional  anti-West Country bias.

THE REALITY: In 2011 Miriam O’Reilly, 53, took the BBC to an employment tribunal claiming she had been dropped as a presenter of Countryfile because of her age. The presenter won her case and returned to work at the BBC. 

Taking the strain: Salman Rushdie, left, and the BBC's Alan Yentob in the comedy series

THE COMEDY: Bonneville’s character Ian Fletcher, newly appointed as Head of Values, has been brought in to turn around the beleaguered Corporation in the light of a  wave of scandals or ‘specific learning opportunities’.

During a meeting of the BBC’s ‘Way Ahead taskforce’, he describes the broadcaster as ‘one of the greatest ideas in the world’  and insists that it must face the challenges of the future  with ‘confidence’.

THE REALITY: Tony Hall, who  took up his post as Director General in April 2013, has said the Corporation most become more ‘aggressive’ and ‘less British’ when it comes to defending its corner.

THE COMEDY:  Employees at the BBC’s high-tech New Broadcasting House HQ complain about their open-plan office, which contains ‘interactive spaces’ rather than actual offices.

THE REALITY: Last year the BBC spent £500,000 on a revamp of its brand new £1 billion New Broadcasting House because staff there claimed it was not vibrant or creative enough. The improvements included the installation of ‘a new collaboration project zone.’

THE COMEDY: The BBC’s next big must-see production is Britain’s Tastiest Village,  which is billed as ‘Countryfile meets the Bake Off with a bit of  the One Show thrown in just  in case’.

THE REALITY: Critics say  that the Corporation’s schedules are dominated  by consumer and lifestyle programmes. This is despite the fact that the BBC  Trust has called for more original and distinctive  TV shows.
