Angela Willan, 29, was found asleep at the wheel of her car next to a shivering child in December

A drink driving mother was found asleep at the wheel of her car next to a shivering child with a bottle of whisky in the footwell.

Angela Willan, 29, was found slumped in her car, which was parked in Manchester city centre, at around 4pm on a December afternoon.

Security officers from Manchester University discovered her outside an entrance to a building on Booth Street East, with the keys in the ignition.

She appeared to be asleep so they tried to rouse her - but called police after smelling alcohol, prosecutors said. Police discovered a half drunk bottle of whisky in the footwell of the car.

Sitting in the car with her was a young child who was said to be extremely cold and shivering. He had also wet himself and was taken into protective custody by police.

The court was told the child had some marks on his face and was checked at hospital and found to be 'fine' other than being cold.

Willan, from Whitefield, near Bury in Greater Manchester, was arrested after failing a breath test.

At the station, she gave a reading of 64mg in 100ml of breath, nearly twice the legal limit.

She told police a friend had visited her home on the evening of the incident on Friday, December 6, and persuaded her to drink as many as five brandy and cokes.

She then got behind the wheel with her friend and the child. When they ran out of petrol, the friend left to find fuel.

Willan pleaded guilty to drink driving, driving without insurance and child neglect at an earlier hearing.

Philip Reed, defending, said: ‘This 
was a one-off and was a moment of madness that has blighted this young 
woman's life. All decision making was coloured by alcohol.’

Willan
 had been warned she faced jail but was instead sentenced to a community
 order with 120 hours of unpaid work and banned from driving for 18 
months.

She must also be supervised by probation staff for a year and was ordered to pay £85 costs with a £60 victim surcharge.
