One of the ring leaders of a child grooming gang in Rotherham has boasted he is 'living the high life' after being released from jail.

Umar Razaq, 28, was jailed in 2010 in a case that lifted the lid on the horrific extent of sexual exploitation in the South Yorkshire town.

But after appealing the length of his four-year sentence, he has been released - and is now jetting off on holiday to Pakistan.

Jetting off: Umar Razaq, 28, only served a year for grooming in Rotherham and is now free to go on holiday

Bragging: He posted this status on Facebook, leaving his victim Lizzie feeling tormented

His victim Lizzie, who was only 12 when she was groomed by Umar Razaq, has been left distraught by the posts, saying he 'taunted' her on the social networking site after being released from jail.

Posting a selfie in sunglasses on Facebook, Razaq boasted: 'Can't wait... Roll on to the lifetime holiday'.

'Three days and I'm outta this country for a very long time. Feeling happy,' he added.

The sickening Facebook posts come in the wake of a damning report that revealed at least 1,400 girls were subjected to sexual abuse and grooming at the hands of Asian gangs in Rotherham for 16 years.

There are now 173 live investigations into grooming in the town, while council officers face calls to acknowledge the 'systemic failures' of their leadership by stepping down.

Razaq, who served less than a year despite the depravity of his crimes, allegedly stalked Lizzie earlier this summer by 'following' her boyfriend on Facebook. 

Lizzie, not her real name, was raped by four other men after Razaq groomed her. She claims she told police and Rotherham Council about his activities on the internet but they 'weren't bothered'.

She said: 'I told South Yorkshire Police what he was doing and how scared I was but no one seemed to care. The police knew exactly what was going on months ago but none of them were bothered.'

Last night South Yorkshire Police said they unable to comment on Lizzie's allegations.

Talking of the effect of Razaq's stalking, she said tearfully: 'It was like he was taunting me, saying he could see what I was doing and was watching me.

'He shouldn't be allowed out in the first place and what he has been posting about his own life is disgusting.

Victim: Lizzie, a victim of the Rotherham scandal, was groomed from the age of 12

'Taunts': Razaq, who served less than a year despite the depravity of his crimes, was yesterday boasting of 'living the high life' while on a 'holiday of a lifetime'

'I feel frightened that he can see me and could find me so easily. It all takes me back to what happened.'

She claimed Razaq had been following her boyfriend, Jack, on Facebook without them realising. This meant he was able to watch what Jack was posting on his profile page.

Then, earlier this Summer, he added Jack as a friend – which is when she looked at his profile and she realised 'the awful truth'.

She said: 'I was freaked out, I saw the profile and asked Jack if he knew him and he said no. He could see everything we were doing, all the soppy things we were saying and all the things that are private.'

Razaq was jailed in November 2010 for four-and-a-half years but had his sentenced reduced to three- and-a-half. The 28-year-old was released in July 2011 having served just nine months, after his time in remand was taken into account.

On Facebook yesterday, he boasted that he was 'living the high life' after leaving the country on Tuesday to go on a 'holiday of a lifetime'.

In July he posted a story about a 'woman crying rape' and wrote: 'All women are the same.'

Jack said: 'It's almost as if he is proud of what he has done.'

Lizzie, who is now 19, said: 'These men should not be allowed on the streets. When I was told Umar was out in July 2011 by Victim Support I couldn't believe it. He had been in less than a year.'

Lizzie was 12 and living with her grandmother in Rotherham when she first came across Razaq in January 2008.

He was 22 – ten years her senior – but plied her with cigarettes and alcohol, and she eventually started to meet him in the town centre. She said: 'Umar used to tell me he loved me and had feelings about me.

'He treated me like a princess and said my family did not love me and didn't want me. He got my trust then did horrible things to me.'

Razaq also introduced her to his older brother Razwan and his cousin Zafran Ramzan – who both groomed her for sex. After a few months, when she had turned 13, Razaq tried to force her to have sex with him, trying to tear her clothes off. He pulled her hair and called her a 'white bitch'.

On another occasion Razaq rang his cousin and told him to come and have sex with the girl while he looked on.

She said: 'I was only a little girl when I was raped for the first time. Five men sexually abused me, in alleyways, parks, on playing fields and even in cars.'

All five of her abusers were jailed in November 2010. Zafran Ramzan was jailed for nine years for raping a 16-year-old girl and two counts of sexual activity with a child.

The other four, Razwan Razaq, Mohsin Khan, Adil Hussain and Razaq, were convicted of sexual activity with a child.

Revealed: Officers' callous treatment of sex gang victim

Ready for lessons in her school uniform, and hugging her parents on a family holiday, Katie's childhood photos are like any other young girl's.

The pictures give no sign of the horrors that awaited her when she met her abuser.

At 14, she fell for the man ten years her senior who groomed her into a violent relationship and separated her from her family.

Katie's childhood photos are like any other young girl's, but they show no sign of the horrors that awaited her when she met her abuser

Yet council workers and police acted as if she was to blame for getting involved with the convicted criminal, she claimed.

She said one officer, attending an incident where her abuser had threatened to kill her, even told her: 'Well, what did you expect?'

Katie – not her real name – was attacked several times by the man, who had served two jail terms, but said police did nothing to help her and saw the assaults as just 'a bit of domestic violence'. Her desperate parents had her put into care, hoping it would end the relationship, but she said carers openly allowed him to continue visiting.

Yesterday she called on South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright, responsible for Rotherham children's services, from 2005 to 2010, to resign.

Katie, now 29, said: 'He should be ashamed of himself. The more he holds on to his job, the harder it will be for victims to move forward.'

She said it was 'disgraceful' her abuser was still walking free and that council and police staff had held on to their jobs, adding: 'I was emotional when I first saw [the report] on the news, but now I am in anger mode – I want justice to be done.

'When I was 14 and 15 I thought I was in love with him, but when I was 16 I made a statement because there's only so much you can take. The police took a statement and to my knowledge he has never even been questioned. He should have been punished.'

Katie's abuser was allegedly reported to police by a council organisation for victims of child sex offences in 2001, after it heard from 18 girls who described him as their 'boyfriend'.

Yesterday, South Yorkshire Police did not respond to requests to confirm whether they had taken any action against the man.'
