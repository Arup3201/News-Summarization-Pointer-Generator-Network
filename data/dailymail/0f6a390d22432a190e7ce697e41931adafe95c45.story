Although I'm a beauty lover first and foremost, I also adore my fashion. Some of you may be aware I actually have my own clothing collection with Lipstick Boutique.

I'm particularly proud of my latest collection – there's an array of pieces to suit different body shapes, styles and occasions, from glam gowns to more comfortable, casual pieces which are perfect for everyday wear.

I recently did a shoot to showcase the collection. I didn't want to go too overboard with my make-up so as not to detract attention from the pieces themselves, so opted for a sleek graphic eye line paired with a summery pop of colour on the lips.

For her Lipstick Boutique shoot Binky opted for a Sixties-inspired beauty look

Here's how to achieve the look in just a few quick steps:

BEAUTIFUL BASE

First, I prepped my skin with the Guerlain Meteorites Base Perfectrice Pearls.

The light diffusing particles in this luxurious primer help correct uneven complexions and provide skin with an illuminated glow.

I followed this up by applying Clarins Everlasting Foundation, the medium coverage formula disguises blemishes like a dream while still offering a fresh-faced finish. Living up to its name, this foundation won't budge all day if topped with the right powder, making it my ideal choice for photoshoots or a night out.

To set this in place, I brushed a light dusting of Too Faced Primed and Poreless Powder across my face.

Binky wanted her make-up to be quite subtle so as not to detract from her clothes

SLIM AND SCULPTED

Next onto contouring: I used the Daniel Sandler Sculpt and Slim Palette to chisel my cheekbones and give my skin a gorgeous shimmery glow.

FELINE FLICK

I opted for a simple yet sexy feline flick on the eyes using the Guerlain Liquid Eyeliner. Liquid eyeliner can be tricky to apply, but I find the easiest method to be shutting your eye and stretching out the lid with a finger.

Binky opted for a simple yet sexy cat eye flick and paired it with a muted pink lip to keep her look suitable for day wear

Gently dot the eyeliner across the upper lash line, slightly flicking it out towards the outer corner. Once you have your basic shape, build the line up slowly and extend the flick to your preferred size. Make sure you work the eyeliner right into your lash line for a clean, sleek result.

I wore individual false eyelashes on the shoot to accentuate my peepers, but if you don't have any to hand, apply generous lashings of Too Faced Lash Injection mascara to give your lashes a similar voluminous flutter.

Binky recommends applying a translucent powder to ensure your make-up stays put

PINK POP

Finally, I slicked a coat of Dior Trianon Rouge Lipstick in Rose Crinoline – a gorgeous coral pink tone – over my lips.

The creamy yet super long-lasting formula is perfect for occasions where you want your lippy to last without drying out your pout, and the vivid hue complements the simple graphic eye line beautifully.

Et voila! A simple and sexy look that works equally well for work or play. You can get all the products I wore on the shoot from Escentual.com.
