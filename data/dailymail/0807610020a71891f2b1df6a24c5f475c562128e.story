The body of a transgender woman found brutally murdered in Baltimore is the sibling of an NBA player.

Mia Henderson, 26, was found by police in an alley in the northwest of the city in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

Henderson, who was born Kevin Long, was a sibling of Reggie Bullock of the Los Angeles Clippers.

Bullock paid tribute to Henderson in two tweets send on Wednesday with the hashtag '#RIPKEVIN.'

'All I can say is my brother showed me how to live your own life. Love you so much man. Gone but not forgotten' he tweeted.

And 'At least I sent the last love you to my brother.'

Police have not identified any suspects or established a motive, and they don't know yet whether there's any connection to the slaying of another transgender woman last month.

Cops are still searching for the person who murdered Kandy Hall, who was stabbed to death in early June.

Investigators also say they are looking back at cases that are several years old to see if there are any similarities with this latest murder, but they aren't saying how Henderson was murdered.Â 

'We do know that there was trauma to the
 body to indicate that there was a homicide,' Major Dennis Smith of the Baltimore City police told WJZ.

A broken necklace and a pool of blood remain in the alley where police found Henderson's body.

Bullock is heading into his second season with the Clippers. He was a first-round draft pick last year out of the University of North Carolina.
