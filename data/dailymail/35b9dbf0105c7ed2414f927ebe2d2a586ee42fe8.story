Chiming every 15 minutes for more than 100 years, the sound of the church clock is as familiar to the villagers of Wherwell as birdsong.

But one resident finds it far from melodious, claiming he can’t manage to sleep through the noise.

Chris Molden’s £1.5million home is just 100 yards from St Peter and Holy Cross church in the Hampshire village.

For over 100 years the clock has chimed every fifteen minutes at Wherwell, near Andover, Hampshire, since it was installed to celebrate the
Coronation of George V

After he complained, the church provisionally agreed to turn off the quarter-hour chimes from 11pm to 7am.

But it is adamant that the hourly chimes must stay – day and night.

The tower clock, installed to celebrate the coronation of George V, has been out of action for a year.

It was restored in time for yesterday’s Easter services with the help of a £9,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.

Within minutes of the chimes ringing out, environmental health officers from the local council arrived to test the noise levels.

A spokesman said: ‘The complainant has requested it [the chimes] be switched off at night. We are deciding whether that is appropriate. That does not mean it is too noisy all the time.’

Yesterday, church warden Pam Prince said: ‘There has been this complaint put in and it has to be sorted. It would be nice if it could continue chiming all night.

'The village loves to hear it chiming.

'It would be nice if it could continue chiming 
all night. The clock is working again and we are very pleased.”

Parish council chairman Jane Andrews said: ‘It is sad when there is disagreement in a community.

'But if you buy an old rectory it is quite likely there will be an old clock that chimes.’

It is unclear how long Mr Molden has lived in the village. Yesterday he was away but his wife confirmed he had complained about the noise.
