Search and Rescue and air ambulance charities are to get VAT refunds and more Government cash following lobbying from Prince William.

The Chancellor will announce in today’s autumn statement VAT breaks for the sector from next April, alongside £7.5 million extra support for air ambulances. The tax refunds will be worth £25 million over five years.

The Duke of Cambridge, the second-in-line to the throne, is said to have been angry at pressure on air-sea rescue services.

As a helicopter pilot at RAF Valley in Anglesey Prince William helped out with mountain rescue, coastguard and air ambulance services

As a helicopter pilot at RAF Valley in Anglesey, he has helped out with mountain rescue, coastguard and air ambulance services.

David Cameron revealed at Prime Minister’s Questions in 2011 that the Prince had urged him to do more to support the services, many of which are run by charities.

‘I have been lobbied extensively about airsea rescue, by people from all walks of life, if I can put it that way,’ he said.

Currently, most search and rescue and Air Ambulance charities cannot claim VAT back on their activities.

Inland safety and air ambulance charities can already take advantage of the Chancellor’s announcement earlier this year of a five year grant scheme to help them mitigate the costs of fuel and fuel duty.

Today’s measure will mean all 150 search and rescue and air ambulance charities will be able to apply for VAT refunds on all their search and rescue activities as of April 1 next year.

As well as VAT refunds, the Chancellor will announced £1 million for the Great Western Air Ambulance, which will pay for the first year of a new helicopter’s running cost.

The Kent Surrey Sussex Air Ambulance Trust will get £1.5 million towards the cost of a new helicopter. The Chancellor will also create a ‘helipad fund’ worth at least £5 million to pay for more landing sites.
