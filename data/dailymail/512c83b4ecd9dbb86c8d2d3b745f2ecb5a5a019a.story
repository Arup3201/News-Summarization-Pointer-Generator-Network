Alexis Sanchez’s girlfriend Laia Grassi has deleted every Instagram photo of the Arsenal forward less than three weeks after he was accused of texting former Miss Chile, Camila Andrade, behind her back.

Sanchez and Grassi are believed to have split following accusations made by Andrade, who said she turned down the £30million signing’s invitations to dinner ahead of the 2014 World Cup.

Grassi previously uploaded selfies of her and the former Barcelona star on social media, but has now removed every trace of Sanchez.

Andrade also accused Sanchez of sending her holiday snaps during a winter break to Disneyland Paris with partner Grassi, claiming the Chile forward insisted he was with a younger relative and not his other half.

In reports which made headlines across his South American homeland, Andrade said: ‘Alexis invited me out for a meal while he was back in Chile preparing for the World Cup.

‘I was between boyfriends at the time and it was the first time that he’d asked if we could meet up.

‘I turned him down because he wasn’t my type and I knew that many of the times he’d messaged me he was with his girlfriend and I liked that even less.

‘When he was in Disneyland Paris with Laia in February he sent me a picture of himself on his own. I knew he was with her because I’d seen pictures in the paper and I really couldn’t stop laughing.

‘I messaged him to say, “How nice, you’re with your girlfriend, I’d love to be where you are with my boyfriend” and he replied: “No I’m with my little nephew or young cousin or some young relative”, I can’t remember exactly.

‘He never said he was with his girlfriend and the following day there was a big picture in the paper of the two of them. It was very strange.

‘All these starstruck young girls need to see all these footballers are the same and are not to be believed.’

Sanchez, who has scored nine goals in the Barclays Premier League this season, previously made headlines after a former girlfriend claimed she was pregnant.

Spanish art director Grassi stuck by Sanchez after Mary Plaza made the claim, posting an Instagram selfie afterwards with the message: ‘Amor Verdadero’ - Spanish for ‘True Love’.
