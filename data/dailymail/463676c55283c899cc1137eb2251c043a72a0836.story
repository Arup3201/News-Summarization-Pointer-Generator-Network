'I'm no cheat'... Sachin Tendulkar reveals shock over ball-tampering claims in new autobiography, admitting he nearly quit India's tour to South Africa

Retired cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar has revealed that former England captain Nasser Hussain was the best skipper he ever played against.

Hussain spent the best part of four years as England captain, taking charge of 45 Test matches and Tandulker believes he was an 'excellent strategist' despite occasionally deployed 'negative' tactics. 

Speaking in his new autobiography, 'Playing It My Way', serialised in The Times, Tandulker wrote: 'Among the captains I played against, I consider Nasser Hussain the best.

In his autobiography ‘Playing it My Way’, the star tells how he blamed himself for Team India's defeats

'He was an excellent strategist and even if some of his tactics occasionally bordered on the negative - using the left-arm spinner Ashley Giles to bowl to me outside my leg stump from over the wicket, for example - he was a very good thinker about the game and was proactive.

'He would not place a fielder in a particular position after a shot was played. Rather, he had the ability to anticipate the shot and would place a fielder well in advance, making a real difference to the team.

'Nasser and Giles were counting on the fact that I would have limited scoring options off balls bowled there and were hoping to frustrate me and induce me to play a false shot.

'They has essentially given up any attempt to get me out in favour of trying to get under my skin.

Mumbai-born Tendulkar, 41, also reveals that Michael Clarke was the best Australian skipper he had faced, mainly because his predecessors had the benefit of working with some of the biggest talents in the game.

He added: 'Among the Australians, I rate Michael Clarke as the best captain I played against. While I was too young to judge Allan Border in 1992, Mark Taylor, Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting benefited from having some of the greatest players of our generation in their teams.

'With so many match-winners, the role of the captain automatically reduced.'
