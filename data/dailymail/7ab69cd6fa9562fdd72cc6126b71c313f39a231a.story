A pensioner facing child rape charges who fled Britain using his elderly brother’s passport has been arrested in the Canary Islands.

Frank Burgon, 76, from Hartlepool, absconded after he was released on bail on charges of rape, attempted rape and three counts of indecent assault against a child.

Since his escape, he has been travelling through several countries posing as his older sibling Stanley before settling in Gran Canaria.

Arrested: Runaway Frank Burgon was discovered in an apartment in the Canary Islands on Sunday, after travelling on his brother's passport

Spanish police arrested him on Sunday 
at an apartment in the holiday resort of Puerto Rico after a British 
neighbour of Burgon's alerted cops in the UK.

Burgon,
 who vanished in November 2012 after being bailed on charges of rape, 
attempted rape and assault, is now set to be prosecuted by Spanish 
authorities for identity theft.

The new charge is not expected to delay his extradition back to Britain.

A Spanish Civil Guard spokesman confirmed: ‘Frank Burgon was arrested at an apartment in the resort of Puerto Rico on Sunday.

‘He was flown to Madrid on Monday for an extradition hearing.’

A source said: ‘He will be accused of identity theft because he was posing as his brother by using his passport.

‘He'd travelled to several countries with it and was able to get away with the ruse because of their physical similarity.

‘When we arrested Burgon, he claimed at first we'd got the wrong man and insisted he was his brother Stanley.

‘He
 only admitted the truth when we warned him we'd be doing fingerprint 
tests and checking him for body tattoos we'd been told he has.

‘We arrested him following a call from British police who were alerted by a neighbour of Burgon's who recognised him at the apartment block in Puerto Rico

‘Now we know he's been living in Gran Canaria we will launch our own investigation to see what he's been getting up since he's been here.’

A European Arrest Warrant was issued in July for former fisherman Burgon when he missed three court dates after denying the rape and child sex charges.

A spokesman for Cleveland Police said: ‘Cleveland Police can confirm that a 76-year-old man was arrested on Sunday by Spanish authorities on suspicion of a breach of a court order.

‘He is currently in the custody of the Spanish authorities awaiting extradition proceedings.’
