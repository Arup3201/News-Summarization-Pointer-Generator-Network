Tiger Woods’s frustration at the lamentable state of his game boiled over on Saturday when he launched a foul-mouthed volley at a television cameraman.

The American had missed yet another fairway at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and the cameraman was busy trying to keep up as Woods made his way fuming into the undergrowth.

Struggle: Defending champion Tiger Woods has yet to find his form an is 15 shots of the pace on one-over-par

Desire: Woods needs to finish well in the next two tournaments if he hopes to qualify for the FedEx Cup

Realising he was being closely 
pursued, Woods – seemingly oblivious to the fact his large gallery was 
full of young kids - turned round and said, loudly: ’Guys, give me a 
little f***ing space.’

The cursing was picked up by Sky television, who issued an apology to any viewers who were offended. 

This
 was the week where Woods, an eight-time winner at Firestone, was hoping
 to revive his career and make a case for a Ryder Cup place following 
four months out after back surgery.

Instead he’s hopelessly adrift at 
tied 36th after a poor third round of 72.

Woods
 is now nine rounds into his comeback, but only two have been under par.
 At least he was more sociable afterwards.

Asked which holes he was most
 pleased about for his first three rounds, he smiled and responded: ’The
 19th.’

Expletive: Woods was heard swearing at the cameras after a poor shoot on the sixth hole in Ohio
