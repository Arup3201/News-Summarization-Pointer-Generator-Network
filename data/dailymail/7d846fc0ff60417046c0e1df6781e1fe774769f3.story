An incredible phenomenon has been captured on video for the first time as washing-up bubbles are shown freezing in mid-air.

The footage, filmed on cameras four-times sharper than HD, shows a group of children blowing the bubbles in a Canadian forest.

As the bubbles hit the air, they crystallise and turn into hollow blocks of ice in slow motion.

An incredible natural phenomenon has been captured on video for the first time as washing-up bubbles are shown freezing in mid-air. As the bubbles hit the air, they are shown crystallising and turning into hollow blocks of ice in slow motion (pictured)

The video was directed by Leila and Damien de Blinkk, and was set in forests near Whistler in Canada.

A series of 4K cameras were positioned to captured the bubbles as they hit the air.

Shortly after each appears, the crystal-like structures of the ice are shown forming and bonding together.

A bubble is formed when a layer of water molecules is trapped between two layers of soap molecules.

Each soap molecule is positioned so one side faces the water, while the other faces away. 

Glycerin, C3H5(OH)3, extends the life of a bubble by forming hydrogen bonds with water, which slows down how quickly it evaporates. 

When a bubble is blown, the air inside it is warmed by the air in the blower’s lungs.

As this warm air hits the cold air, it contracts to set the surface of a bubble.

In extreme temperatures, this water layer freezes first, followed by the soap layer - making the walls of the bubble more structurally sound, and visible.

The difference in air pressure and temperature eventually causes the air inside the bubble to disperse and burst the surrounding later.

As these structures spread across the bubble, they are is shown creating a solid outer shell.

The film then records the bubbles shattering and shards of ice falling to the ground.

Director, Leila de Blinkk said: ‘We were blown away by the beauty of the intricate patterns that the freezing of the bubbles’ surface was creating at very low temperature.

‘The feather, flower and star ice shapes were so delicate and mesmerising when they reflected light.

‘To bring out all these details in 4K was to almost discover a new world, that we didn’t suspect existed.’

No special effects or editing were added to the bubbles, and the films were shot in real-time before being slowed down.

In one shot, an icy bubble is shown as tough enough to be held in a hand.

No matter what shape a bubble creates when its first blown, it eventually forms a sphere to minimise the surface area of the structure. This shape uses the least energy to form.
