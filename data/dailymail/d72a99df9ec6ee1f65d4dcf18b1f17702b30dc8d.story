With a price tag of £17.5 million, anyone looking to buy this luxury flat opposite The Ritz would already need to dig pretty deep.

But the purchase price of the five bedroom apartment, which sits on the upper floor of a Grade II listed six-storey Italian Renaissance style Piccadilly building, is just the start - it also comes with a £65,000 per year service charge.

The apartment was originally built in 1921 as a dealership for Wolseley Motors, a luxury car brand which was once the biggest selling car maker in the UK.

But the firm went bankrupt in 1926 and Barclays Bank bought the prestigious building, which is directly adjacent to the iconic Ritz Hotel.

In 2003 it was bought by entrepreneurs Chris Corbin and Jeremy King who opened up The Wolseley Restaurant, and the luxury apartments were built above the eaterie.

The five bedroom apartment is spread across 4,000sq/ft and features a 31.6 ft long drawing room, a formal dining room and a large kitchen and breakfast room

Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, which is selling the property, said: 'With its views onto the world famous Ritz Hotel this is one of St James¿s most prestigious luxury apartments, benefiting from a triple AAA Prime London address'

The agent added: 'The apartment provides an abundance of luxuriously appointed lateral living space and the views from the reception room onto the Ritz are breathtaking and priceless'

But anyone who can afford the luxury apartment is likely to leave the kitchen unused when they see the restaurants nearby.

There is the Wolseley below, the Ritz across the road and Le Caprice at the end of the road.

'The apartment provides an abundance of luxuriously appointed lateral living space and the views from the reception room onto the Ritz are breathtaking and priceless.'

As a dealership in the 1920s, the cars were displayed on the marble floors of the building and cost up to £1,300 - a fortune at the time. 

Wolseley customers included the Emperor of Japan, Viscount Nuffield and King Haile Selassie of Ethiopia.

It is now a luxury home fit for Royalty, with the master bedroom suite the size of a conventional one-bedroom apartment, boasting twin dressing rooms and his and hers bathrooms.

There are are a further four bedrooms - three with en suite bathrooms - and a guest cloakroom and a shower and bathroom.
