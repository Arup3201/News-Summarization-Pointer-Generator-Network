Amelia Horn, who used the alias Logan Montoya, blackmailed two dentists by threatening to expose them

A call girl threatened to expose two dentists for having underage sex unless they paid out thousands of pounds by pretending she was 17.

Escort Amelia Horn, who used the alias Logan Montoya, masterminded the plot so the terrified men would give the money to her and her two accomplices. 

Although she was 24, Horn and her accomplices pretended she was 17 to give them leverage in their blackmailing scam.  

The dentists - who feared the exposure would ruin their lives, careers and reputations - handed over £16,500 in return for the trio keeping their meetings with Horn a secret.

At one point, Horn's friend Luke Burton, 31, demanded £5,000 off one of the dentists, by threatening to sell photographs of him 'having sex with a minor' to a newspaper. 

The other victim transferred £10,000 to Horn's account in return for her silence.

The 24-year-old - who once appeared in a national newspaper, claiming to be a nymphomaniac - even went to one of the men's surgery's for treatment while blackmailing him. 

After she was caught, she told police: 'To be honest these men make me sick, they pay me for unprotected sex. I just wanted to scare them, you know.'

Mobile phone footage also emerged showing the gang dancing and cuddling each other over the success of their scam.

In the video, retrieved after their arrests, the third defendant Loretta Isaac was also seen putting her face up to the camera and yelling: 'Blackmail, blackmail.' 

Horn, from Stockton-on-Tees, and Burton, from Birmingham, were today jailed for 30 months, after admitting blackmail.

Isaac, 24, who was Burton's girlfriend at the time, was given a 12-month sentence, suspended for two years, after admitting possession of criminal items.  

Judge Peter Armstrong told Horn she had 'started things rolling' by blackmailing the first of her two victims.

He said Burton had then 'jumped on the bandwagon' and had demanded more cash from both her victims in two phone calls on the same day.

Judge Armstrong said Isaac's involvement was less serious but that she had anticipated being paid some of the money 'knowing full well where that money had come from.'

During the hearing, Teesside Crown Court heard how the first victim, a married man from Newcastle, became involved with Horn and met her five or six times for paid sex. 

Rupert Doswell, prosecuting, said 'The first complainant, who I will call Professional Man A was a dentist by profession and at the time was practising in Newcastle. He is a married man with children.

'He became involved with Amelia Horn, who was working as an escort and he paid her for sex. She said she was 23 and from Middlesbrough and he met her five or six times. On one occasion she visited him at his place of work and received dental work.

'On August 11 last year, a couple of months later, Mr A received a message on his mobile phone from Amelia Horn demanding £5,000 from him and that if it was paid he would not hear from her again.

'He was distraught and thought she would ruin him, his career and his family and he paid £5,000 into her bank account.

'Then at 3pm on Friday November 29 he was at work when he received a call from a man saying he was a relative of Amelia Horn. In fact it was Luke Burton.

'He told Mr A he was aware he had been seeing Logan Montoya, which was an alias used by Horn.

'He told MR A that she was under age and that if he didn't pay £10,000 by the middle of the next day he would go to the press and turn up at his house and speak to his wife and family. Mr A paid him the money.'

Mr Doswell said the second victim was also a dentist who found Horn while looking on an adult website on his iPad in November last year.

He found 'Logan,' who appeared to be in her twenties, and they arranged to meet for sex in an apartment on the quayside in Sunderland.

The court heard how, after he had paid her £200, Horn performed oral sex on him. She later asked several times what he did for a living.

In the following days, the man began to receive text messages from Horn. One of them said she desperately needed £1,500 for building work on her home.

He agreed to pay her the cash in return for the equivalent amount in sexual favours.

But each time he contacted her afterwards, Horn made excuses not to meet for sex.

She later asked for a further £2,500, of which he gave her £250.

Then, on November 29, Mr B was called by Burton - the same day that he had threatened the first victim.

Burton demanded £5,000, saying he would expose Mr B if he did not pay up.

Burton said he photographs of him 'having sex with a minor' and would give his story to newspapers.

He even suggested the headline: 'Depraved dental surgeon pays 17-year-old for sex.'

But the trio's plot came to an end when the second victim went to the police and told them what had happened.

All three were arrested.  

Rachel Dyson, for Horn, said: 'She accepts responsibility for these offences and understands the consequences and impact on the two gentlemen involved.'

She said Horn had suffered a troubled childhood, having been in care homes and foster placement.

The court heard Horn has had a baby since the offences took place and had proven herself to be a good mother.

Earl Pinnock, for Burton, said he had only been involved in the plot for one day - on November 29 last year. He added that, during his time in custody, his younger sister had died of cancer.

Joe Hingston, for Isaac, said she had suffered a difficult past having had a 'delinquent teenage life fuelled by alcohol.' 

He said she still battled with a drink addiction but her only part in the plot was being Burton's girlfriend and agreeing to receive some of the money.

Sentencing, the judge told Horn: 'To make a demand of £5,000 from someone in his position is a very serious offence of blackmail, made more serious because you threatened to reveal the truth. No doubt terrified of being exposed, he paid the £5,000 into your account.'

He told Isaac: 'On a video that was recovered the three of you were dancing around and you were calling out "blackmail,blackmail", as if it was something worthy. It wasn't, it was a despicable course of conduct.'
