More than 1.7 million GlucoMen LX Sensor blood glucose test strips are being recalled for fear they may give false readings

More than 1.7 million blood glucose testing strips are being recalled for fear they may give false readings.

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said people with diabetes should not use the strips because of fears they could give inaccurate results, leading to a patient injecting too much insulin.

The strips have been subject to a manufacturing fault.

They are GlucoMen LX Sensor blood glucose test strips for use with the GlucoMen LX and GlucoMen LX PLUS blood glucose meter.

The strips are manufactured by Menarini in Italy and distributed in the UK.

There are no reports at present of patients being harmed by using the strips, the MHRA said.

Just over 1.7 million test strips in the affected lots were sold to pharmacies in the UK between October and November 2012.

The affected lots are 3212219249 (expiry date 31/08/2014) and 3212214249 (expiry date 31/08/2014).

The MHRA is investigating why the manufacturer did not alert it to a potential problem with the strips until last month.

The strips were not distributed in the UK after November last year but officials are worried they may still be on shop shelves, or that people may still have them in their homes.

The manufacturing fault has now been resolved.

John Wilkinson, the MHRA's director of medical devices, said: ‘People who have GlucoMen LX Sensor blood glucose test strips from these specific lots at home should not use them.

‘The manufacturing fault in these test strips could give a misleading reading that may result in people overestimating the amount of insulin they need to take.

‘This fault has been resolved and the two affected lots of faulty test strips have not been sold in the UK since November. There is no evidence that any patients in the UK have been adversely affected by the faulty test strips.

‘If people have the faulty test strips 
at home they can telephone the manufacturers, Menarini, on 0800 243667 
and they will be given free replacements.

‘If they have questions, they can contact their GP, diabetes clinic or another healthcare professional who can give them advice about what alternative test strips they can use.’

Some three million people in the UK have diabetes, of who about 90 per cent have type 2 diabetes.

People with type 1 or type 2 often test their glucose several times a day using test strips and a hand-held monitor.

The reading tells them whether they need to inject insulin to bring down high blood sugar, or eat more to increase their blood sugar levels.
