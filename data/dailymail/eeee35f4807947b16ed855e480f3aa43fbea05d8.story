A family of thieves targeted a Toy R Us store in South Florida with children playing a role in the brazen theft.

A mother, father and their seven kids all descended upon the store in Boca Raton, but it wasn't to pick out holiday gifts, but rather steal from the store.

Cameras caught the family of nine, which included kids between the ages of three and 13, making off with a couple of gadgets.

Dash & grab: A family of thieves targeted a Toys R Us store in South Florida. Parents along with their seven children managed to steal a number of tablets from displays before walking out

Pre-planned: The family knew exactly where they were heading as they made their way over towards the electronics section of the store

Spotted: The family could be seen in the area of the store where the tablets were located

Upon entering the store, the group made their way over towards the electronics section where the tablets were on display.

According to investigators, the children appeared in and out of the video as if they were climbing under the cabinets.

Store management at the Toys R Us told the police that it appeared the parents had instructed the kids to undo the security devices that were attached to the devices.

It appears as though two of the security alarms were removed from the tablets. 

Stolen: Items were ripped from their attachments on the store's shelves

Brazen: The family spent around 20 minutes in the store before they races out with their hoard of stolen items

Investigators believe the kids succeeded in removing two of the security devices from the tablets.

The parents then walked by the shelves and took two of the tablets and the whole family left the store together.

'That's awful, that's awful. They should you know, teach good principles, good manners, how to be polite,' said shopper Lis Santos to CBS 12 News.

'I think that's quite unfortunate, you would be under the impression that a parent would be a good role model for younger children.  Unfortunately those are the things that are going on in society nowadays,' said Josh Borrero, another shopper at the store.

The video shows they were in the store for about 20 minutes. The two tablets they took, a Tabeo E2 and a Polaroid 10.1,  were worth over $300 dollars.

Authorities ask anyone with information about this incident to contact Palm Beach County Crime Stoppers at 800-458-8477.
