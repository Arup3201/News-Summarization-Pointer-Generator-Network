A 76-year-old man is believed to have shot his 85-year-old sister in the head before turning the gun on himself outside the church where they were long-serving members of the congregation.

Police arrived at the First Baptist Church of Grayson in Gwinnett County, Georgia, to find Clarence Porter and his sibling Avis M. Whitley dead in a white 1996 Mercury Villager van parked in the lot.

They were discovered by their elderly brother Raleigh Porter, who also lived next door to the pair, as Sunday morning service was about the begin.

He told 11 Alive: 'We had no idea that this was coming.'

Investigators said that Ms Whitley had suffered a severe stroke a few weeks ago and had been in bad health.

The siblings lived together at a house in Loganville and police say they have not yet determined a motive for the murder-suicide.

Church members told My Fox Atlanta that Mr Porter had a key to the church had shown up at about 8.30am, two hours before the congregation, to drop some money into the offering.

The elderly man had been a long time deacon, head usher and worked with the church's food pantry.

Place of worship: Clarence Porter, 76, shot his 85-year-old sister, Avis M. Whitley, 85, outisde the First Baptist Church of Grayson in Georgia on Sunday morning before service

He apparently unlocked 
the church, left their offerings and his church keys inside, and then 
went back to the van to shoot his sister in the head and then himself.

Investigators found a silver handgun in the driver side floorboard.

The niece of the elderly pair Karen 
Boykin said: 'They were both very involved in their church and community
to give back and they gave back to their family.

'They were always available. He took such loving care of Aunt Mardel so none of this makes any sense.'

The siblings were two of 13
brothers and sisters in a close knit family. They shared a Loganville 
home where he cared for her. The family said Mr Porter complained he had not slept for 18 days.

Their brother Raleigh Porter added: 'I think he just got run down and got depressed; she was not in good health either.'

'They had come in this morning just 
before Sunday school,' Reverend Tim Brogan told the AJC. 'I'm still kind
of processing everything.'

Reverend Brogan told the paper that 
the siblings had attended the 140-member church for 'a long time,' well 
before he began as a pastor four years ago.

Close knit: The siblings belonged to a family of 13 and shared a home together

Long-time members: The pair had been part of the congregation for many years and the murder-suicide has left the community shaken

'We tried to find a way to comfort them,' Reverend Brogan told the AJC after breaking the news to the bereaved family.

The service went ahead and the pastor preached a sermon about hope but admitted the loss would be difficult to cope with.

'Obviously, the mood was kind of down,' Brogan told the AJC. 'We talk about this church being like a family.'
