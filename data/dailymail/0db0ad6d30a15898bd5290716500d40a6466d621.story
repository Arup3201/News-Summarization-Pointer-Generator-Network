Kayleigh Renwick was forced to cancel her wedding plans when she gave birth just hours after finding out that she was pregnant

Most brides dread something unexpected happening on their big day - the flowers not turning up or the rain pouring down.

But those minor issues pale in comparison to one young mother - who was forced to cancel her wedding plans when she gave birth just hours after finding out that she was pregnant - for the second time.

Kayleigh Renwick, 24, was unaware she was pregnant when she went into labour and gave birth to a son last Saturday.

But what might sound like a once-in-a-lifetime shock was actually familiar territory for the young mum and her partner Daniel Madge, 34.

Just 18-months-ago Kayleigh gave birth to her daughter Lucy, five weeks past her due date - having had no idea that she was pregnant.

Now the proud parents, who have another daughter Grace, three, have welcomed baby Jacob into the brood - born just 12 minutes after his worried mum arrived at the hospital.

The couple, who have been together for seven years, had spent the last eighteen months battling to make it down the aisle.

But the unexpected arrival of Lucy, on May 14, 2012, saw them cancel their booking at Durham register office and swap their nuptials for nappies.

Only last week Kayleigh and Daniel resumed making wedding plans, which have now been put on hold again after the weekend's unexpected arrival.

Just six months before Jake's surprise
birth - when Kayleigh was two months pregnant - she and Daniel decided 
that they weren't going to have any more children and gave away all of 
their baby supplies.

Just 18-months-ago Kayleigh, seen with partner Daniel Madge, gave birth to her daughter Lucy, five weeks past her due date - having had no idea that she was pregnant

But 
after finishing work at 12.30am on Saturday morning after a long shift 
in a working men's club, Kayleigh started to feel pain in her back at 
her home in Stanley, County Durham.

The pain became so severe as the night progressed that Daniel phoned an ambulance - by which point baby Jacob was already crowning.

Daniel, a kitchen fitter, said: 'The nurse told me to check down there and I got a shock and a half.

'I’m not a midwife but I know the top of a head when I see one.

'Kayleigh was crying her eyes out.

'Lucy and Grace were climbing all over trying to see what was going on.

'She was just saying, "It can't be happening again, you're wrong".

Surprise! Lucy, aged 18 months, and baby Jacob were both unexpected arrivals for their parents

Jacob was born at 6.40 am, and weighed a healthy 7lb 13

'The nurse said to get towels but we haven't got a tumble dryer and they were all wet.

'I was panicking then and she said, "You sit yourself down and breathe as well".

'It was total deja vu.'

Remarkably, Kayleigh didn’t notice putting on any weight during either pregnancy, and friends even commented that she looked to have lost a few pounds on both

occasions.

Throughout both pregnancies Kayleigh was taking the contraceptive pill every day and had periods every month.

Kayleigh, who also works as a nursery nurse, said: 'I just couldn’t believe it.

'I was in total shock.“Both times there had been no clues.

'On the day Lucy was born I had been to the park, done grocery shopping and been out and about - all while being in labour.

'With Jacob I had been to work all day.

'I never thought it could happen again in a million years.'

Jacob was born at 6.40 am, and weighed a healthy 7lb 13 - but 7lb 7oz Lucy’s arrival last year was far more complicated.

'Daniel, a kitchen fitter, said: 'I got a shock and a half. I'm not a midwife but I know the top of a head when I see one'

Again, Kayleigh was suffering from backache, and after arriving at the University Hospital of North Durham, found she was 8cm dilated and about to give birth.

The placenta had dried and if the pregnancy had been left undetected for just a few more days, both Kayleigh and Lucy would have died.

After birth, Lucy was diagnosed with plagiocephaly - a condition which means the head is misshapen - and still has to wear a helmet 23 hours a day.

Kayleigh and Daniel have also missed out on two holidays after Lucy’s unexpected birth and complications with her treatment saw them cancel trips to Fuerteventura and Bulgaria, but the happy couple wouldn’t have it any other way.

'When are you ever really ready for children?' said Daniel. 'You just get on with it.

'The girls dote on him and we couldn’t be happier.'
