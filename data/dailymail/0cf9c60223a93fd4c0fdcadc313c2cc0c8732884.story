A 20-year-old soldier has returned safely from Afghanistan with the 100-year-old Bible that has accompanied four generations of his family into five conflicts.

Private Curtis Welsby took the Armed Services Testament 1916 - issued as standard to his great-great grandfather when he fought in World War One - with him to Camp Bastion last year.

But the tiny Bible has also seen active service in World War Two, the Korean War and Northern Ireland with his relatives who all returned home safely.

His great-great-grandfather Jay Greenwood was just a teenager when he lied about his age in order to sign up to go to the battlefields of World War One.

It was then passed to Private Welsby’s grandfather Dennis Farrell who took it with him while serving in the Second World War from 1940 and later to Korea.

The paperback Bible, which falls open at John and Acts, even survived Dennis’s time in a Korean prisoner of war camp and was later handed to his son, and Private Welsby’s uncle Gary Farrell who served in the King’s Regiment in Northern Ireland.

Private Welsby, 20, from Manchester, serves in the 1st Battalion of the Mercian Regiment and recently returned from a seven month tour in Afghanistan.

He hopes to pass the family heirloom onto his seven-year-old nephew who already has aspirations to join up.

When his friend was killed in an explosion he turned to the well-leafed pages and found comfort in Revelations 21:4 which reads: 'and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain.'

Private Welsby said: 'I knew it was a big responsibility to take such an important piece of family history with me into the field but I couldn’t have gone without it.

'It’s been everywhere so it was only right that it came out to Afghanistan with me.

'I carried it with me all the time and when we were out on patrol I would be checking every couple of hundred metres just to make sure it was still there.

'I definitely think of it as a good luck charm and something that was protecting me while I was out there.

'My comrades are a bit in awe of it. Most of us have something that we take with us as good luck from home but no-one else has got one of these.

'I've never seen anything else like it.

'I was really close to my Grandad and when he had it with him for the whole of the time he was a prisoner in Korea which is incredible.

'I think that it gave him a bit of faith that he would get out, which he did thankfully.

'You just need something to comfort you a little bit and the Bible did that tremendously.

'Reading it after my friend died made feel happy for him thinking ‘it’s alright, he’s gone to a better place with no more war, fighting or anything’.

'Anything can happen when you’re out there but, when I picked up my Bible, I felt that nothing would happen to us.

'We got into fire-fights, but we always got out of them.

‘The local kids used to ask me for it. But I always said no. It’s been in my family for so long. It’ll be passed on to my nephew. He’s only seven, but he already wants to be in the army.

'It’s going to him in about 11 years when he joins the Army.

'That said, if I’m still around, I’ll be hanging onto it. It’s such good luck - he’ll have to wait!'
