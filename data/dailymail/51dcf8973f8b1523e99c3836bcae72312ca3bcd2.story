Twitter has named their first female board member to help run the company, announcing the move via Tweet on Thursday morning.

Marjorie Scardino was most recently the CEO of Pearson PLC which owns the Financial Times and a major book publishing firm.

The 66-year-old, who was born in the U.S. but has taken British citizenship and lives in London, also previously served on the board of Nokia, worked at The Economist Group and was the publisher of The Economist and CQ Roll Call.

Milestone: Marjorie Scardino has been named as the first female member if the board of Twitter after the company came under scrutiny for having very little diversity on their board

Twitter, like Facebook before its own IPO, was criticized for not having women or minorities on its board of directors.

Faced with its lack of board diversity - three of Twitter's directors are named Peter - CEO Dick Costolo tweeted earlier this year that diversifying the board 'has to be about more than checking a box.'

She confirmed the announcement by posting her first Tweet: 'Thank you. There couldn't be a more exciting time in Twitter's history to join!'

Facebook named its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, to its board after it went public in May 2012.

Boys club: Twitter came under fire because so many of the company heads- like (left to right) co-founders Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone, Evan Willams and CEO Dick Costello- were white men

Unlike Facebook, though, Twitter still doesn't have any high-ranking female executives.

Scardino joins Costolo, Chairman Jack Dorsey, along with co-founder Evan Williams and venture capitalists such as Peter Fenton, a general partner at Benchmark Capital, on Twitter's board.

She will replace David Rosenblatt on Twitter's audit committee while Rosenblatt will continue to be on the compensation committee, the company said in a regulatory filing.

As part of joining Twitter's board, Scardino was granted a restricted stock unit award of 4,018 shares of the company, which will vest quarterly over one year.

Record breaker: Scardino (seen here in 2000) was the first woman to become CEO of a FTSE 100 company when she held the title of Pearson PLC CEO 16 years ago

During her time at Pearson, Scardino was the first woman to become CEO of a FTSE 100 company when she held the title 16 years ago.

The index of leading British stocks is similar to the S&P 500 in the U.S.

In her words, not much has changed in that time when it comes to gender imbalance.

Last year, she told the Telegraph that she 'thought in 1997 that by the time I left Pearson things would be different in terms of how many women there were as chief executives or chairmen or board members. It's not too different and for that I'm sorry.'
