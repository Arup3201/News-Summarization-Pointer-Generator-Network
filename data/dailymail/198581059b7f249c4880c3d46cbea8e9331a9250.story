Acrimony between groups supporting Hillary Clinton's almost certain presidential run spilled over today, with Media Matters founder David Brock suddenly resigning from the board of a super PAC backing the former first lady.

Brock allegedly sent the co-chairs of Priorities USA Action a scathing letter today accusing the group of participating in 'an orchestrated political hit job' on his own pro-Clinton organizations, according to Politico.

In addition to Media Matters, an left-wing organization that exposes conservative media bias, Brock is responsible for the formation of American Bridge, a super PAC dedicated to electing Democrats, and Correct the Record, an association housed within American Bridge that focuses on rapid responses to attacks on Clinton.

David Brock, the founder of the liberal media watchdog Media Matters for America, a group whose mission is to expose mis- and disinformation from the right, allegedly sent the co-chairs of a pro-Hillary group a scathing letter today accusing them of 'an orchestrated political hit job' on his own Clinton-aligned organizations

An unsteady alliance to begin with, Brock's blow up highlighted additional cracks in the network of groups serving as Clinton's surrogate presidential campaign. 

Previous accounts from Democratic operatives with knowledge of the organizations' communications with one another exposed animosity between Priorities and Ready for Hillary, a grassroots group that primarily amasses names and information on potential Hillary voters.

Bickering between the two groups over turf grew so heated, Politico said in a January 2014 report, that a top Clinton aide, Huma Abedin, and other longtime Clinton allies, including former Bill Clinton Chief of Staff and Think Progress founder John Podesta, were asked to step in.

After aborting a plan to shutter Ready for Hillary's operations, the organizations eventually agreed that Priorities would focus on raising money from big donors - who can funnel the group unlimited amounts of money per federal election law - and Ready for Hillary would stick to volunteer recruitment and data collection.

A New York Times article published last week that took a critical tone to the fundraising efforts of Media Matters, American Bridge and Ready for Hillary - all of whom use the same fundraiser, Mary Pat Bonner, and offer her firm a generous commission - sent the delicate coalition into a tailspin once again.

Politico reports that Brock responded to unflattering review of his group's fundraising practices by resigning from Priorities USA Action and sending its co-chairs, former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm and Obama 2012 campaign manager Jim Messina, a nasty letter pointing to their organization as a source of information for the New York Times piece. 

In the letter Brock allegedly contended that Priorities had engaged in a 'serious breach of trust between organizations that are supposed to work together toward common ends.'

The situation has 'created an untenable situation that leaves me no choice but to resign my position,' he reportedly wrote.

Brock is also said to have claimed that 'current and former Priorities officials were behind this specious and malicious attack on the integrity of these critical organizations.'

Former Secretary of State Hillary  Clinton takes questions from John Podesta, a former chief of staff to her husband, during a September 2014 Q and A. His next act will likely be steering Clinton's 2016 campaign. Already, he's been tapped by groups backing Clinton that just can't seem to get along as a go-between

A senior adviser for Ready for Hillary told Politico his group did not harbor the same suspicions and would maintain a friendly association with the super PAC.

'We have worked with them for almost two years. We continue to work with them. We all do very different things, so there’s not a lot of overlap,' said Craig Smith.

A spokesman for Priorities denied the allegations to the publication.

'Priorities USA Action and allied organizations demonstrated a clear ability to work together effectively in 2012 and we look to replicate that success again in 2016,' he said. 

Clinton is expected to formally join the 2016 horse race late this spring. Numerous reports on the inner workings of her campaign have suggested that she may wait as late as June, however, to make an announcement to give her more time to build her team and iron out her campaign message.

The possibility of Clinton waiting to announce her candidacy until so late in the year has troubled some of her allies and Democratic operatives who worry that in assuming an air of inevitability she will again lose the presidency.

Another former Barack Obama campaign hand, David Axelrod, who was instrumental in former Illinois senator's victory over Clinton seven years ago, has repeatedly warned Clinton while promoting his memoir Believer: My Forty Years in Politics, that if she uses the same playbook as she did in 2008, she could lose again.

Clinton 'needs a very well-conceived message about where she wants to lead the country. If she doesn't have that, then it does become a problem,' he told USA Today during an interview published on Monday.

And instead of behaving at the race's frontrunner, she must 'approach this campaign like a challenger...like an insurgent,' Axelrod, now a professor at the University of Chicago, said.

'What she can't rely on, and I don't think she will, is the Clinton name.' He also encouraged her to stay away from the 'visceral connections' she made with voters in 2008 that he said 'terrified' him.
