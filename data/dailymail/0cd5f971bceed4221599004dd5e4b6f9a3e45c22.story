An elderly woman has died in a car accident after attending a funeral service for a cousin in Sydney's north.

The male driver of the car, 80, was taken to Westmead Hospital with injuries after the vehicle apparently drove out of control - first running into a building and then into a palm tree.

Janine Marra - another member of the family, who was the first on the accident scene - has told MailOnline how she and the funeral's director desperately tried to help the mother-of-four, 79, and the driver.

The married couple had just attended a funeral in Ryde. The woman, 79, died at the scene but the man, 80, was transported to Westmead Hospital

The couple were travelling down Quarry Road in Ryde when they collided with a building and ricocheted into a tree

The occupants of the car - who Ms Marra confirmed were married but declined to name them - were leaving a funeral service at Fields of Mars Cemetery in Ryde when the tragic accident happened. Police say no other vehicle was involved in the incident.

Ms Marra said she was about to leave the service on Friday when she and funeral director Michael Manning saw the couple's Nissan Pulsar moving back and forth erratically.

'A few moments more and [Michael] would have pulled the keys out. There was nothing he could do and we jumped in a car to follow them but by the time we got there they had hit the palm tree. I hoped that she died on impact because then she wouldn’t have suffered'

She told Mr Manning to go investigate what was happening and when the car didn't stop he reached in to take out the keys, but before he could the car took off at a high speed down Quarry Road.

She said: 'A few moments more and [Michael] would have pulled the keys out.

'There was nothing he could do and we jumped in a car to follow them but by the time we got there they had hit the palm tree.

'I hoped that she died on impact because then she wouldn’t have suffered.'

Ms Marra said there was hardly anyone else around to help, except for some grave diggers and a few family members, before emergency services arrived.

She then had the difficult task of breaking the news to the woman's children, who did not attend the funeral.

Friday's incident happened at the Fields of Mars Cemetery at 12.45pm

Fire and Rescue NSW tweeted crews had to cut the driver out of the Nissan Pulsar

She said she rang one of the sons, adding: 'He had to ring two brothers and a sister to break the news to them.'

A New South Wales police spokeswoman said the Nissan Pulsar clipped a building before it hit a tree while travelling down Quarry Rd at 12.45pm on Friday.

'It’s left the roadway and ricocheted into the tree,' she said.

The spokeswoman added the woman had died at the scene.

Crews from Fire and Rescue NSW had to cut the driver out of the vehicle.

It was reported by the ABC that the accelerator of the car became stuck and prompted the car to crash.

But Field of Mars cemetery chief executive Pauline Tritton said it was not known if this was the case or if the driver had a foot on the accelerator.

Police continue investigations into the incident and a report will be prepared for the coroner.
