A vicious winter storm bringing strong winds and heavy  'wallpaper paste' snow that battered much of the Midwest is heading for the East Coast.

The snowstorm has forced more than 1,200 flights to be cancelled, including 900 from Chicago’s O’Hare International, and has left the roads a slushy mess as the Windy City is expecting as much as a foot of snow.

In Minnesota, authorities reported more than 120 crashes, though none of them fatal. However, a truck driver in Wisconsin is believed dead after his semi-truck fell over an icy bridge and into a frozen pond; rescue crews are working to retrieve the body of the truck’s passenger.

'It will be a wet, heavy, gloppy snow consistent with wallpaper paste,' he said.

'We're expecting a sizeable accumulation for Washington DC, where there has not been a storm to produce more than 2 inches of snow since January 2011,' Vaccaro said.

North Dakota on Tuesday was digging out from the storm, which caused blowing snow and drifts up to 3 feet (0.9 meter) high in blizzard conditions in the northwest oil region, a foot of snow near Minot and 15 inches near Grand Forks on Monday.

Hardware stores in and around Chicago did brisk business on Monday, selling salt and snow shovels at a time many usually turn their thoughts toward gardening and baseball.

'Everybody's got a little comment with every bag they're buying,' Mike McIntosh, who works at Dressel's Hardware in Oak Park, told the Associated Press.

Workers had started to stock the shelves with tools and supplies associated with spring and summer, only to find the shovels and salt they thought they'd hold for another year were still in demand.

'Everybody's a bit surprised, but it's good for us, we've got a lot of this stuff to move,' he said.

On Monday, the system moved across the Dakotas and Minnesota, dropping up to a foot of snow in some areas and freezing rain in others. Some schools closed and officials warned motorists to stay off the roads.

As it moved eastward, emergency officials in a number of states issued similar warnings in the hopes that commuters will leave their cars in the garage and take public transportation to work.

A wet snow pelted commuters as they slid along the slick streets of downtown Chicago through the soggy wintery mix early Tuesday. Snow was forecast for the morning and afternoon rush hours, Seeley said.

The weather service also said that as much as 1.5 inches of snow could fall per hour, 'making snow removal difficult and travel extremely dangerous.'

Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn urged motorists to avoid driving unless absolutely necessary, insisting that 'safety comes first.'

The Illinois Department of Transportation planned to send a fleet of 360 trucks to plow roadways in northeastern Illinois early Tuesday, with a total of 600 throughout Northern Illinois.

The storm is creating wet, heavy snow - known euphemistically as 'heart attack snow' - which could pose a risk when it comes time to shovel for the elderly, sedentary people or those who have heart problems.
