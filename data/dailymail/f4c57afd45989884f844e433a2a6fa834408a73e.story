This is the horrific moment a teenager was hurled 70ft in the air by a hit-and-run driver racing another car on the wrong side of the road.

Megan Heaps, who was on a zebra crossing at the time of impact,  was carried on the bonnet of the speeding Vauxhall Astra before being thrown into the road by the car.

Shocking CCTV footage captured the terrifying moment and now the teenager is hoping it will help the public to name the maniac behind the wheel.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

This blurry figure is Megan walking across the zebra crossing seconds before she was hit by the Vauxhall Astra. The teenager has appealed to the public to name the driver who hit her

In this blurry CCTV image the silver car, pictured travelling on the wrong side of the road, has just hit Megan who is being carried on the bonnet before being flung on to the road seconds later

Amazingly, she escaped with just a 
dislocated shoulder, cuts and bruises.

Megan was on the crossing in 
Reddish Road, Reddish, Stockport at 9.45pm on Monday, March 12 when she was hit by the silver car, 
which is thought to have been racing a blue Volkswagen Polo. Both cars 
were on the wrong side of the road.

She said: 'If anyone knows who they are or can find them, they need to tell the police so they can stop them doing it again.'

Speaking from her hospital bed Megan said: 'I just remember being on the road trying to cross the zebra crossing.

A faint outline of Megan, circled, lying on the road can be seen in this image moments after the car disappears from view. Amazingly she escaped with just a dislocated shoulder, cuts and bruises

'I’d made it to halfway over and then I looked up and I saw this car coming at me at about 60 or 70mph on the wrong side of the road. I didn’t have a chance to get out of the way.'

Megan, a physical science student at Stockport College, said: 'I’m in pain all down the left side of my body.

'The worst of it is that the crossing is right next to a school and if that had happened in the day time, it could have been a child that got hit and they could have been killed.'

Megan’s grandfather, Peter Heaps, said: 'I don’t understand how anyone could do that - it is beyond reason. For all they know she could have been dead. How do they sleep at night?'

Megan was hit near the junction of Broadstone Hall Road South.

Megan lies on the ground, circled, and anxious drivers passing the scene stop and get out of their cars to see if she is okay and wait with her until help arrives

The cars sped off towards Gorton Road. A third car slowed down but then carried on.

Other drivers raced to help Megan, who was taken to Stepping Hill Hospital.

Pc Steven Wright, from the Road Policing Unit, said: 'I am certain that the driver would have known that they were involved in a collision so for them to then drive off at speed and leave a young girl injured in the road is astonishing.

'I would also appeal to people to keep an eye out for the Astra and contact us if you spot it.'

Police believe the Astra would have had front end and windscreen damage.
