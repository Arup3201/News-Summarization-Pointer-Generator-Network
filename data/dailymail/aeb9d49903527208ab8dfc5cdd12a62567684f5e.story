It was a singularly evil chemical weapons attack, but tragically the hundreds killed in Damascus last week were just the latest victims in a long history of the use of poison gas to kill soldiers and civilians.

Indeed, an examination of such past atrocities reveals many exacted an even greater toll.IRAQ AGAINST THE KURDS

Saddam Hussein’s regime used chemical weapons to remove Kurds from around 40 villages in northern Iraq.

On March 16, 1988, he carried out the most deadly attack, dropping poisons including mustard gas, sarin and VX on the town of Halabja. Men, women and children choked to death in the indiscriminate attack.

The atrocity prompted the United Nations Chemical Weapons Convention in 1997, an international pact banning production, stockpiling or use of chemical weapons. Only seven nations – including Syria – are not signatories.

DEATH TOLL: Up to 5,000.

Chemical gas was used to attack Iraqi Kurds in 1998. 5,000 civilians were killed

IRAN-IRAQ WAR, 1980-88 

Hussein used sarin and mustard gas against Iran to tip the war in Iraq’s favour and force Tehran to negotiate.

But newly declassified CIA documents revealed recently the US knew about the use of chemical weapons but refused to act because Washington feared an Iranian victory.

DEATH TOLL: Up to 20,000.

VIETNAM

Between 1965 and 1975, in the bitter war against communist North Vietnam, the US dropped millions of tons of incendiary napalm to defoliate dense forests in which enemy fighters were hiding.

The jelly-like substance ignited and stuck to skin, burning through muscle and bone, causing hideous injury and often death.

America also dropped 50 million tons of Agent Orange, a super-strength chemical herbicide, to destroy all plants.

But poisonous dioxins seeped into the soil and water supply, entering into the food chain and leading to severe health problems and disabilities for generations. 

DEATH TOLL: More than a million, as well as 400,000 Vietnamese children born with birth defects due to exposure to Agent Orange.

NAZI GERMANY

Hitler refrained from using chemical weapons in battle but millions of Jews were transported to extermination camps, notably Auschwitz in Poland, and were suffocated in gas chambers using cyanide-based Zyklon B.

DEATH TOLL: Approximately six million Jews died in the Holocaust, plus gypsies, homosexuals, the disabled, and Soviet prisoners. 

WORLD WAR TWO

Between 1937 and 1945, Japan launched both chemical and biological attacks while invading China. Emperor Hirohito authorised use of toxic gas on more than 2,000 occasions.

In 1941, members of a secretive Japanese research and development facility – Unit 731 – airdropped fleas contaminated with bubonic plague on the Chinese city of Changde.

DEATH TOLL: Tens of thousands.

ITALO-ABYSSINIAN WAR

Ignoring the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning chemical or biological agents in war, Mussolini’s Italy unleashed mustard gas during its invasion of Ethiopia in 1935.

Retaliating for the killing of one of its pilots, the air force dropped up to 500 tonnes of poison.

DEATH TOLL: Estimated 15,000.

FIRST WORLD WAR

Known as the ‘chemists’ war’ for introducing deadly poison to combat. In 1915, at Ypres, Belgium, Germany opened thousands of canisters of chlorine upwind of Allied troops, condemning many to an agonising death.

By 1918 chemical weapons had proliferated on both sides – including phosgene, cyanide and mustard gas. Horrified by the effects, 15 countries signed the Geneva Protocol.

DEATH TOLL: Around 90,000 and more than one million injured.
