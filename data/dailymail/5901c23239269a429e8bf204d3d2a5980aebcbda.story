A council has been accused of ordering CCTV 'spy' cars to hit minimum targets for issuing penalty notices - despite the practice being illegal.

The alleged policy, carried out on behalf of Haringey Council in north London, was revealed in a series of leaked emails.

They showed the council's CCTV cars were told to issue at least 260 fines a day - a total of 87,360 a year. The council has denied imposing a quota for fines.

Furious community leaders and traders in the Highgate Village area of the borough have called the policy 'immoral' and claim CCTV patrol cars are simply a 'money-making exercise' for the Labour-run authority.

Emails sent between the council's parking manager and supervisors show that combined targets set for parking tickets issued by CCTV cars and wardens across Haringey in 2008 was 121,632.

The messages were sent on April 10, 2008, just 10 days after the government issued guidelines warning that parking fine quota systems were illegal.

Chairman of the Highgate Society, Kirsten de Keyser, said: 'Nobody should ever impose targets - that's appalling. It's not some kind of profit-driven business. They should never use fines and penalties to raise money. It's immoral and unethical.'

The leaked email from April 2008 said: 'The (CCTV cars) target for the year is 87,360. We are confident that we can achieve this target given that we are taking on new operators, return of a CCTV manager and the new cameras coming online.'

The emails also show that local parking wardens were given a minimum target of issuing 362 parking tickets a day across the team.

Another email to supervisors dated May 7, 2010, said staff were not performing to the 'average expectation' and threatens staff dismissal or a conduct hearing if improvements were not made.

Immoral: Traders in the Highgate Village area of the borough say the council's CCTV cars are simply used to make money

Lee Harper, owner of Highgate Butchers, feared he would have to close his shop after his supplier was repeatedly fined as they tried to make deliveries.

'They were ticketed three times in one week and landed with a bill of £330 after being targeted by a CCTV smart car, run by external parking contractor On Time.

'I'm not surprised about this - it's just a money-generating exercise,' he said, 'we have to pay rates of £925 a month and we need to have the meat in to sell, so it's a total paradox. I'm just one guy trying to make a living.'

A council spokeswoman said: 'Haringey Council does not set targets for parking penalties, and it is inaccurate to claim that we do.

'In fact, the email from 2010 clearly states that there is not a target for PCNs (penalty charge notices). The email from 2008 is now five years old.

'We did not set targets for PCNs after legislation was changed in 2008. In the case of this email, which was sent just 10 days after legislation was changed, the officer incorrectly used the term 'targets' to refer to forecasts for the anticipated number of PCNs for the following year.'

She added that the forecasts are 'common practice' and designed to 'give an overview of workload for the coming year, rather than as any measure of staff performance.'
