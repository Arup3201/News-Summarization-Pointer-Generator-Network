A disabled woman has been stuck in her armchair for three years because she can't climb the stairs and her wheelchair won't get through the front door.

Sally Walker, 50, lives, sleeps and eats in the seat at her home in Southampton, Hampshire, and relies on photographs taken by her family to see what the outside world looks like.

The mother-of-two suffers from chronic lymphoedema - an abnormal collection of high-protein fluid just beneath the skin, usually in the arm or leg - which she was diagnosed with at the age of 25.

Before then she lived an active life, going to the beach and regularly seeing friends, but the crippling condition has left her confined to her living room.

Her two-bedroom council home doesn't have a ramp and is too small for her wheelchair - and the last time she went upstairs was seven years ago.

She said: 'I just want to give up. I have had enough because I'm thinking what's next because there is nothing. What is the point? I am just existing, not living.

'I've been depressed for years but this has tipped me over the edge. I'm 50 years of age and I am trapped. I have no privacy and no life.

'I'm frightened of dying here in the chair. This is it. This is my life. All I see is these four walls.'   

Mrs Walker, who lives with her carer husband Stephen, 51, and her sons aged 30 and 28, spends her days on Facebook, reading, watching TV, talking to friends and petting her dog Chalkie.

She said: 'I just dream of being able to get out. When I do have to go to the hospital when I get outside in their chair or bed and the fresh air or sun hits me and I think "oh my God, what's that?" It's really weird.

'I have to ask the carers what it is like outside and my family show me photos of the garden.'

'I was never in before. I would find any excuse to go out, even if it was just to go round Steve's mum's house.

'We spent Christmas down the beach with the dog, we used go on holiday.'

Following the birth of her first son, she began suffering symptoms and was diagnosed with the condition.

She said: 'I had a GP come out to me and he said he'd been a GP for over 40 years and he'd never come across a case so bad in his life.

'He thought I'd been in the tropics because my case was so bad. But it just gets worse and worse.'

Mrs Walker also has weeping blisters on her legs and is in 'agonising' pain with lumps in her stomach and legs.

The 50-year-old lives, sleeps and eats in the seat and her mobility is so bad she can't even go up the stairs in her two-bedroom council home

The council adapted a shower upstairs but she cannot get there so instead she has to be washed using a bowl and flannels in her armchair.

There is also a toilet which has been fitted next to the living room but plumbing problems mean she is forced to use a commode.

The couple say they have spoken to their housing officer about their accessibility issues and were told there were bungalows but they are not available and they have no idea of the waiting time.

Last year eight paramedics spent three hours helping Mrs Walker after she fell at her home. 

The pair, who have been married for 32 years, claim the council would not re-house them because they have made adaptations to their home even though they are no longer suitable.

The Walkers are supporting a campaign run by the Leonard Cheshire Disability Charity which believes unsuitable and dangerous housing causes problems like depression and accidents, which end up costing the taxpayer much more than if the homes were better designed in the first place.

Clare Pelham, chief executive for Leonard Cheshire Disability's, said: 'For many of us, our homes are a haven - places where we look forward to relaxing with our friends and family.

'For many thousands of disabled and older people, their homes are a danger to their health and wellbeing.

'It is shocking that GPs are spending precious time on injuries and illnesses directly related to inaccessible homes at a time when there's overwhelming pressure on our health care system.

'And yet it would cost absolutely nothing for the Government to require all new homes to be built to accessible standards.

'With our ageing population and an increase in the number of disabled people, these homes are needed now.

'We literally cannot afford to wait while disabled and older people are suffering.'

Lymphoedema is a chronic condition that causes swelling in the body's tissues. It can affect any part of the body, but usually develops in the arms or legs.

Other symptoms of lymphoedema can include an aching, heavy feeling in affected body parts and difficulty moving them. 

Lymphoedema comes in two forms - primary and secondary. Primary lymphoedema is caused by faulty genes, and develops at birth or shortly after puberty. It's fairly rare and affects one in every 10,000 people. 

Secondary lymphoedema is more widespread and is caused when an infection, injury, trauma or cancer damages the lymphatic system. It's estimated that 100,000 people in the UK have secondary lymphoedema.  

There is no cure for lymphoedema, but it is usually possible to control the main symptoms using techniques to minimise fluid build-up and stimulate the flow of fluid through the lymphatic system.

These include wearing compression garments, taking good care of your skin, moving and exercising regularly, having a healthy diet and lifestyle, and using specialised massage techniques.

The build-up of fluid in the tissues of people with lymphoedema means they are more vulnerable to infection.

In particular, a bacterial infection of the skin called cellulitis is commonly reported in people with the condition.
