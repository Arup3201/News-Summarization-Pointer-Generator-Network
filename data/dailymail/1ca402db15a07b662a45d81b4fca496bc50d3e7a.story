Family friends say a Texas father accused of killing six relatives in a Christmas Day murder-suicide was struggling financially and hated the fact that his estranged wife was doing well.

Police say 56-year-old Aziz Yazdanpanahwas dressed as Santa when he fatally shot his estranged wife, their two teenage children and three other relatives Sunday inside an apartment in the Dallas-Fort Worth suburb of Grapevine.

After a private burial for the six victims Thursday, family friend Azar Shahbazi said she believed Yazdanpanah was upset because his wife 'was doing good on her own.'

The wife's brother, Ali Rahmaty, says he'd been financially supporting the family.

He says Yazdanpanah had been unemployed for more than a decade, but says he never thought Yazdanpanah would become violent.

They were at an apartment in Grapevine, where his wife and children had been staying.

Yazdanpanah's niece, 22-year-old Sara Fatemeh Zarei, sent a text to a friend just before 11am saying they had arrived at the apartment and that Yazdanpanah was there.

'Soo we're here. We just got here and my uncle is here too. Dressed as Santa. Awesome,' she said in one text.

At 11:15 am she texted: 'Now he wants to be all fatherly and win father of the year.'

Grapevine police Sgt. Robert Eberling said police believe that after Yazdanpanah shot his six family members, he called 911 at 11:34 am and then shot himself.

Police arrived about three minutes later and found everyone dead. It appeared they had been opening presents around their Christmas tree just before the attack.

A recording of the 911 call released yesterday revealed someone saying: 'Help, help' and then 'I am 
shooting people.'

Police said those words, muffled by the caller's 
labored breathing, couldn't be heard by the dispatcher on Christmas Day but were 
audible when investigators used a different software system. 
They believe the call was made by Yazdanpanah.

Authorities believe that in addition to killing his wife of 24 years, 55-year-old Fatemah Rahmati, their 19-year-old daughter Nona and 14-year-old son Ali, Yazdanpanah also killed his wife's sister, 58-year-old Zohreh Rahmaty, her husband, 59-year-old Mohamad Hossein Zarei and their daughter, Sara.

Eberling said one of the two weapons, a 9 mm, was purchased in 1996 and registered to Yazdanpanah. The other weapon was a .40 caliber.

The medical examiner's office said Yazdanpanah's son, daughter, niece and sister-in-law were shot multiple times in the head. His wife was shot once in the head and his brother-in-law was shot multiple times in the head, chest and stomach.

Police believe that before Yazdanpanah killed himself, he tried to stage the scene by placing one of the two guns used in the hand of his deceased brother-in-law, Mohamad Zarei, Eberling said.

'I think he was probably overwhelmed when it was all said and done and decided to take his life instead,' said Eberling, who added that Mohamad Zarei had been shot with both weapons.

Eberling said Yazdanpanah was the only one to fire the two weapons found at the scene. A gun was also found in his hand.

Eberling has said that detectives believe Yazdanpanah's marital and financial troubles led him to kill his family, but added that his exact thought process that morning may never be known.

'We really don't have a clear idea of why he did this,' Eberling said. 'Sometimes there's not a really good explanation for irrational behavior.'

Federal court records show Yazdanpanah was placed on three years' probation in 1996 after pleading guilty to one count of subscribing to a false income tax return. He was fined $1,000 and required to pay $30,119 in restitution.

Three years later, Yazdanpanah and his wife filed jointly for bankruptcy. That case was discharged in a matter of months.

Mashy Modjdehi, a friend of Yazdanpanah's wife who owns a beauty salon in nearby Plano, said the family's financial troubles intensified about four years ago when Yazdanpanah stopped working in the mortgage business.

Modjdehi said Yazdanpanah had long forbidden Rahmati, who holds a state cosmetology license, to work. But once he became unemployed, his wife held down jobs at two spas, the friend said.

Rahmati, known to family and friends as Nasrin, had filed for bankruptcy in August 2010, and told her attorney she hoped the proceedings would stave off foreclosure of the home.

She separated from Yazdanpanah in the midst of the bankruptcy and the proceedings were later dismissed because she failed to make the plan payments, said the attorney, George Barnes. Barnes said Yazdanpanah listed his occupation as 'self-employed'.

Rahmati moved out of the couple's home in Colleyville in April with the couple's two children and into the apartment complex two miles away, Modjdehi said.

Yazdanpanah, often referred to as 'Bob,' remained in the Colleyville home, currently valued on the tax rolls at $336,200, and was often seen working in his yard. Neighbors said there were few signs of discord.

The couple's daughter graduated from Colleyville Heritage High School this year and was attending a local community college. A friend said she hoped to go to school in California and become a lawyer.

The friend, Yiselle Alvarenga, said Nona had hinted in August that things were becoming increasingly difficult in her life but didn't go into details.

Alvarenga said she knew that Nona's father was 'really strict' but that 'her mom was more understanding.'

Just hours before the families were 
killed, the Yazdanpanah and Zarei families had thrown a large Christmas 
Eve party at their ranch. Dozens of friends and relatives celebrated 
late into the night, according to WFAA8.com.

Comfort: The close friends and family of the Yazdanpanahs and Zahreihs mourned their passing yesterday as the shock news of their murder reached them

Friends say Aziz Yazdanpanah, 56, 
likely showed up unexpectedly the next morning as he had not been 
invited to the party as he had separated from his wife in March.

Mona Hosseiny, 27, who grew up with 
the children, told WFAA8: 'They were as close as siblings. They 
basically called each other sister, brother. They were everybody's best 
friend and everybody loved them so much.'

Despite their problems, family friends
say they never expected anything like this: 'During the years, we sensed
things, but not to the point he would take his own children's lives.'

A community of about 46,000 people 
some 20 miles northwest of downtown Dallas, Grapevine is known for its 
wine-tasting salons and was recently proclaimed by the state Senate as 
the 'Christmas Capital of Texas' for its abundance of annual 
holiday-season events.

'This is obviously a terrible 
tragedy,' Mayor William Tate said on Sunday night in a statement given 
to Reuters. 'The fact that it happened on Christmas makes it even more 
tragic.

'This appears to be a family situation and anyone who has a 
family will be incredibly saddened by that happened.'
