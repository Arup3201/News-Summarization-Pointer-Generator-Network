When life gives you potholes, make pictures appears to be the theory of one enterprising New York photographer.

Davide Luciano created a series of conceptual photographs with a surreal edge using the holes and crevasses in streets from Toronto to Los Angeles.

From Alice chasing the White Rabbit down a pothole into 'Wonderland' to a Pamela Anderson lookalike saving a 'drowning man' from one particularly deep crack, the images are both highly inventive and incredibly bizarre.

Luciano’s art has appeared in galleries across the U.S. and Canada along with picture spreads in numerous publications.

The artist and film-maker, who graduated from the Toronto Film School, received an excellence award from the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 
New York City.

Luciano collaborates on his projects with his wife and creative partner Claudia Ficca, a professional food stylist and photographer. 

The couple's latest off-the-wall project is called Gourmet Mouse Traps -  where mini cheese platters are set on top of the traps.
