A notorious Mafia fugitive who has been on the run from Italian justice for two decades let his mask slip yesterday as he attended a London police station.

On Monday, Domenico 'The Professor' Rancadore, 65, who has been on Italy's most-wanted list since 1994, won his fight to avoid extradition after a judge ruled that overcrowded jails there would breach his human rights.

Rancadore, who fled Italy, where he ran a powerful, armed branch of the Mafia, for the west London suburb of Uxbridge, covered his face when he left court afterwards.

But yesterday he let his guard slip as he reported to a police station near his house, showing his face in public for the first time.

Despite pulling his anorak hood around his face on the bright spring day, his face and instantly recognisable large nose were clearly visible as he walked out arm in arm with his wife, Anne.

The father of two, who lives in a modest bungalow and is known to neighbours as Marc Skinner, was known as a mob godfather in his native Italy, where he ran one of the most dangerous factions of the Mafia.

According to former prison chaplain Father Gino Sacchetti, Rancadoreâ€™s Cosa Nostra mob in Palermo's Trabia district was responsible for a series of a sickening attacks in a campaign of intimidation including nailing a dead lamb to his front door, firebombing his car and posting bullets to him.

Fearing the net was closing in after his accomplices were arrested, Rancadore fled to London for a new life in 1994 where he set himself up as a chauffeur driving celebrities in expensive cars.

He lived there quietly with his wife, adopting her English mother's surname Skinner, and their children Giuseppe, 36, and Daniela, 33.

But despite 20 years of living under the radar, he was arrested by Scotland Yard last August and taken to Westminster Magistrates' Court, where a lawyer for the Italian government called for him to be extradited to serve the prison sentence he was given in his absence in 1999.

On Monday, however, Senior District Judge Howard Riddle ruled that Rancadore could not be extradited because cramped prison conditions would breach his human rights.

The judge's hands were tied by a High Court ruling last week when judges decided a Somalian businessman accused of unauthorised financial activity could not be sent to Italy due to a Strasbourg judgement that Italian prisons violated Article 3 of the Human Rights Act that prevents torture, inhuman or degrading treatment.
