You could be forgiven for thinking they have left home in their pyjamas.

In fact these London 2012 torchbearers are modelling the official gold and white tracksuits they will wear as they carry the flame across the country.

While they are supposed to ‘accent the energy of the Olympic flame’, the outfits merely attracted  derision when they were unveiled yesterday, with critics likening them variously to nightwear, nurse’s uniforms and even Sir Jimmy Savile’s tracksuits.

Dressed to impress: Today five London 2012 Torchbearers, including 99-year-old Dinah Gould, second left, hold torches in the new white and gold outfits unveiled yesterday

It emerged yesterday that for 80 per 
cent of its 70-day journey across Britain, the torch will be driven in a
security van rather than carried on foot – with each of the 8,000 
bearers travelling only 300 metres each.

However, the short journeys could be 
just as well, given their 100 per cent polyester long-sleeved outfits, 
which critics pointed out could be uncomfortably sweaty in the summer 
months.

The outfits, which were created by 
sponsors Adidas and made in China, are arguably the third fashion 
failure for this year’s Games.

The uniforms for the ‘Games Maker’ 
volunteers are a lurid mix of ‘regal purple’ and ‘poppy red’, and the 
trilby  hats and pink jackets unveiled for the London Ambassadors were 
compared to Marks & Spencer’s Percy Pig sweets.

But Mayor of London Boris  Johnson 
insisted he ‘thoroughly approved’ of the gold-embossed uniforms. ‘They 
are beautiful  outfits. They are lovely. They  are elegant but not too 
austere,’  he said.

Locog, the London 2012 organisers, 
said the white tracksuits were decorated with ‘gold shards accenting the
energy of the Olympic Flame at the shoulder and neckline.’ It is hoped 
that Stella McCartney’s design for the British team kit, to be unveiled 
later this week, will do a better job of bringing some much-needed style
to the Games.

Yesterday, 7,300 unsung heroes were 
named as torchbearers after being nominated for the contribution they 
had made to their community. The remaining 700, expected to include 
celebrities, will be revealed later this spring.

The oldest torchbearer is Dinah Gould,
99, who will be 100 when she carries the flame through the London 
borough of Barnet. Mrs Gould said she was ‘delighted and honoured’ to be
asked, and will walk the route with her ‘walking stick in one hand and 
the torch in the other’.

Organisers also released a street-by-street map of London 2012's 8,000-mile Olympic torch relay across the UK and Ireland.

Starting
from Land's End on May 19 to as far as the Outer Hebrides and Dublin, 
every inch of road it will go on has been plotted so Britons can find 
out just how close they can get to the iconic symbol of the Olympic 
movement.

After being flown in from Greece, the 
flame will eventually arrive at the Olympic Stadium in Stratford, east 
London, for the opening ceremony of the Games on July 27.

There will be seven island visits 
along the route: to the Isle of Man, Isle of Wight, Guernsey, Jersey, 
Shetland, Orkney and the Isle of Lewis.

The
locations have been confirmed by organisers, taking in famous 
sports venues, historic sites and places of outstanding natural beauty.

Proposed start times of when and where the Olympic Flame will travel across Britain are also included online.

Launching the map London 2012 chairman Lord Coe has declared 'today we bring the Olympic Torch Relay to life'.

'The flame symbolises the Olympic 
spirit and its journey around the UK will bring the excitement of the 
Games to our streets,' he added.

'Now the people know the route the 
Olympic Flame will be carried along and the torchbearers for their 
community, they can start planning how they might celebrate.'

Details on the two-day finale to the 
70-day relay, which brings the Olympic Flame to the lighting of the 
cauldron to start the Games are being kept under wraps until closer to 
the start of the relay.

Former
Olympic champion Jonathan Edwards joined London Mayor Boris Johnson for
a demonstration of the torch relay handovers at a school in east London
yesterday morning.

Around 70 children from Redlands 
Primary School in Stepney wore hats and shook colourful shakers they 
made for the run-through in their playground.

Former triple-jumper Edwards, said: 
'It's a really exciting day. The torch relay is literally around the 
corner and it's all systems go.'

Explaining
the moment when the torches are held together to pass on the flame, he 
said: 'The kiss is the big moment when the flame is passed from 
torchbearer to torchbearer and obviously you have to get it right - you 
don't want the flame to go out.

Route: The torch will go through the land of Robin Hood, Nottinghamshire, who is pictured with 15-year-old Zena Robinson, a Coca-Cola Future Flame torchbearer, who will hold it in June

'It's called a kiss. You have to hold
them together for about ten seconds to make sure the flame passes and 
then the next runner runs off for their 300m stint.'

Mr Johnson said the children from 
Redlands Primary will always remember the day the torch goes along the 
route near their school.

'I think it's going to be something that they'll keep for the rest of their lives,' he said.

'This is something our city will not do again in my lifetime.'

Incredible: The torch will go 8,000 miles calling at some of the UK and Ireland's most dramatic spots including Edinburgh, top left, Dublin, top right, Land's End, below Left, and The Needles on the Isle of Wight, bottom right

Referring
to the oldest torchbearer, Mrs Gould, he said: 'Diana, who's 99, she 
remembers vividly the Olympics in 1948, but people like me probably 
won't see another Olympic Games.

'It's
not just London, it's people from all around the country of all ages 
and obviously I think it's going to be very very wonderful for them.'

Unusual ways have been found for some of the torchbearers to complete their relay leg.

One will carry the flame on a chair 
lift at the Needles on the Isle of Wight, another will skate with it at 
the Nottingham Ice Centre and it will be rowed at Henley-on-Thames and 
on the River Bann in Coleraine, Northern Ireland.

High-flying activities await some torchbearers as the flame will abseil down the Dock Tower at Grimsby and swoop off the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle Gateshead on a zip wire. 

Demonstration: Protesters attempted to disrupt the Beijing Olympic Torch relay in 2008 by grabbing the torch from TV presenter Konnie Huq

Restoration work to the Flying 
Scotsman means that the Scots Guardsman train will now take the flame on
its journey between York and Thirsk.

It will also be taken on a skywalk at Croke Park as it visits Dublin on June 6 in its only stop outside of the UK.

There will be no international torch 
relay - the International Olympic Committee decided to make it a 
domestic event only after the controversial Beijing torch relay in 2008 
where protesters used the event to demonstrate against China's human 
rights abuses.

TV presenter Konnie Huq was caught up in a melee between police and protesters.

People also hurled themselves into the path of 
the relay in London and campaigners tried to grab the torch or put out the flame 
with a fire extinguisher.

A team of 28 police officers will be 
dedicated to protecting the Olympic torch and its bearers during a 8,000
mile tour of Britain.

Commander Bob Broadhurst, the officer in 
charge of Olympic policing in London, said: 'I think the biggest threat will be 
attention seekers, somebody trying to run alongside and grab a bit of the 
glory.

'I'm sure we'll get the odd protest every now 
and then up and down the country.'

A mock run took place this month to demonstrate 
how the police team would deal with various situations if they arose during the 
relay.

The British authorities do not believe the torch relay will face the same issues the Chinese had to deal with, but have nonetheless chosen a much lower profile route.

The teenage son of inspirational fundraiser Jane Tomlinson said today that he is carrying the Olympic Torch on behalf of his late mother.

Steven Tomlinson, 14, will be taking his turn on the relay when the torch arrives in Leeds in June.

His mother, pictured right running in a triathlon, died from cancer in 2007 at the age of 43, and carried the torch ahead of the 2004 Games in Athens.

Mrs Tomlinson inspired thousands of people with her charity challenges while battling against terminal cancer.

The NHS radiographer defied experts and spent seven years raising 
money for charity through marathons, triathlons, the Iron Man contest, a
tandem cycle ride from Rome to Leeds and a bike ride across America, 
from San Francisco to New York.

She raised more than £1.85 million and her family have continued to 
raise funds for her charity, the Jane Tomlinson Appeal, since her death.

'I’m really excited about being nominated as a torchbearer.' he said.

'It’s a great opportunity to be part of the Olympics. I will be doing it on behalf of my sisters and my mum. It should be a great experience.'

She was awarded the MBE for her work in June 2003 and later made a CBE.

Last month, her husband, Mike, 50, of Rothwell, West Yorkshire, and daughter, Rebecca, 23, of Tooting, south London, announced they are planning to run this year’s Paris and London marathons and cycle the distance between them.
