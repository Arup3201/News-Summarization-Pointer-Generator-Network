Pictures have emerged of two members of the conservative Mexican National Action Party which appear to show them dressed up as Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun.

The pictures show Manuel Escobedo Ceballos, 23, secretary of PAN's youth action wing, and his party colleague Karla de la Rosa, 26, in costumes at a Halloween party.

Ms de la Rosa, who is an MP in the Mexican city of Chihuahua, has denied she was dressed as Braun and said her costume was in fact of Greta Garbo, after the images were posted online.

Ms de la Rosa, who is an MP in the Mexican city of Chihuahua, has denied she was dressed as Braun and said her costume was in fact of Greta Garbo

She said: 'I absolutely reject that I was there at the Halloween party as Eva Braun.

'My costume was supposed to be Greta Garbo. Of course it's great to wake up to find you're suddenly famous but I'm sorry to disappoint all those people who say anything different and in fact it isn't true.

'It would almost be funny if it wasn't tragic because there are so many more important things to deal with in Chihuahua than a costume at a Halloween party and whether or not it was Eva Braun or Greta Garbo.

'I don't support the Nazis and if there is anything from Germany that I can be accused of liking, it's their football which I supported during the World Cup.'

PAN spokesman, Alfredo Pinera, said the 
the sharing of the photos was a PR stunt by party rivals at PRI as part 
of a bid to gain more votes in the next election in 2015.

He said: 'The pictures were taken out of context and designed to damage the image of these young politicians.'

Ceballos declined to comment on the pictures but a friend confirmed that they were taken at a Halloween party and repeated the suspicion that rival politicians had leaked them to the media to damage the reputation of his party.

He said he felt Ceballos dressing up with a Hitler-style moustache and cropped hair, and also with a military costume similar to the one worn by Hitler, including a swastika, was appropriate for a Halloween party.
