Manager Andy Awford admits Portsmouth's away record is relegation form. 

Two goals from Reuben Reid, the first a penalty, and one from Lewis Alessandra means Portsmouth have not won away since August.

Awford said: 'At home it's promotion form, but the away form is relegation form.'

Barry Fuller's first goal in eight years earned Wimbledon a first win in seven games. 

The defender's long-awaited goal came when George Francomb's corner was met by Adam Barrett, who knocked down for Fuller  to tap in from six yards. 

Wimbledon boss Neal Ardley said: 'I thought Barry was outstanding. I'll take a bit of credit for that goal. He asked me if he could go up for it and then he turns up with a goal.' 

Chris Beardsley and Lee Barnard both scored twice as a rampant Stevenage hammered Cheltenham 5-1. 

Charlie Lee was also on target, while Byron Harrison replied for Cheltenham.

Stevenage manager Graham Westley sang the praises of strikers Beardsley and Barnard. 

He said: 'That's what they're paid to do, and it's what you always want from your strikers. It shows what work ethic can do for you.' 

Teenage striker James Roberts' third goal in two professional starts earned Oxford victory at fellow

strugglers York. 

Roberts, making his full Football League debut, grabbed the only goal in the first half after scoring twice in the FA Cup brace at Grimsby last week.

Oxford manager Michael Appleton was delighted with Roberts, and said: 'He took his goal well. He continues to get in and get goalscoring chances.'

Accrington manager John Coleman was a frustrated man after seeing his side's four-game unbeaten run come to an end.

He said: 'I'm disappointed, but Carlisle deserved to win. No-one can argue with that. They were the better side in every department. 

'Carlisle were up for the game and we weren't. They outfought us, and I've no complaints about the result.'

Derek Asamoah's first-half goal proved enough for Carlisle.

Southend manager Phil Brown was delighted to see his side bounce back from last weekend's FA Cup humiliation against Conference club Chester. 

David Worrall's third goal in five games was enough to send Hartlepool back to the bottom of the Football League and a delighted Brown said: 'It was a massive win for us after the disappointment of the FA Cup, which I believe we've put behind us now.'

Kevin Ellison was Morecambe's goal hero as they shocked high-flying Bury. 

The veteran front-man scored 20 minutes from time to earn his struggling side a first win since September.

Assistant manager Ken McKenna said: 'We changed our system, which was a brave decision, and it worked really well.'

Bobby Grant and James Collins scored as Shrewsbury saw off Mansfield, who had Jamie McGuire sent off in the first half. 

But Shrewsbury manager Micky Mellon, whose side went second, warned: 'We've done nothing except pick up another three points to add to the tally that we have, so we won't get carried away.'

Substitute Ricky Miller scored within three minutes of coming off the bench to put Luton back on top of the table with victory over Tranmere.

The summer signing from Boston United cut in on to his left foot and put away a fine curling shot from 20 yards.

Luton coach Hakan Hayrettin praised Miller, saying: 'I don't think they expected him to turn and shoot from where he did, but we know he's capable of that.'
