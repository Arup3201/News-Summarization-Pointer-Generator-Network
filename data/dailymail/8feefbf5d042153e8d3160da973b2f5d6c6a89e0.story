Three mounted police officers came to the aid of a reporter in Chicago yesterday, after a protester grabbed the microphone to rant about the President. 

Jay Levine had been reporting on a visit to Chicago by President Obama when a man rushed into front of the camera, and started yelling.

Although CBS cut its live 5pm broadcast at that moment, the incident was caught on camera by NBC Chicago, which also had a news team reporting in the area.

Shock: NBC 5 reporter Mary Ann Ahern was distracted from her broadcast by the ruckus 

Levine, the chief correspondent for CBS in Chicago, was giving a live report on the imminent arrival of Obama to a fundraising event when a man in a hooded top suddenly barged into him.

In footage of the event, shown by Gawker, the man grabbed the microphone and yelled: 'Obama is a war criminal'.

As Levine's broadcast was cut, the feed from NBC's Mary Ann Ahern picked up the aftermath of the protest.

At first Ahern tried to continue with her report on the President's schedule, but as the war protester's cries became louder both she and the cameraman turned to look at the unfolding chaos.

Back up: With a mounted police escort behind him, Levine returns to finish his piece to camera

The NBC cameraman filmed as an unidentified man held the protester to the ground while a shaken Levine looked on.

With the protester contained, but still calling out, CBS resumed its broadcast, but with its reporter surrounded by three mounted police officers.

'I've obviously got a little reinforcement here,' Levine quipped as he continued his broadcast.

Footage of the protest, taken from the two networks, was later put on YouTube.
