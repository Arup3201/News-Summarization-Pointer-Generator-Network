Large pieces of ice slammed down into a Chicago man's apartment and caused destruction on Tuesday, including a massive hole in his ceiling. 

The ice dropped into John Connors' apartment around 12pm his cat Oscar was inside, WLS reported.

'If I would have been home, I would have been killed,' Connors told the television station.

Safe from harm: John Connors' cat Oscar was inside when the ice fell into his apartment on Tuesday, but was not injured during the incident

Connors' neighbor Doris Patiz heard noises, telling WLS 'I heard this terrible blast and I thought it had to be a house that had blown up with gas or something.'

Connors himself told the television station of his shock when coming into his apartment.

'I walked in and it looked like a bomb had exploded up in here,' he said.

He also said that he 'looked up and there was like sky, and clouds, and the planes going by and all that.'

Though ice dropped into Connors' living room, another piece fell into his bedroom, which is separated by approximately 20 feet, the television station reported.

Connors told The Chicago Sun-Times that on Thursday evening Oscar was 'pretty freaked out.' The newspaper reported that Oscar was not injured.

Lake View Patch reported that pal Brian McNally said a piece of ice plummeting from above called a megacryometeor could have been responsible.

Meanwhile, Alder Planetarium's Mark Hammergren told the local news website 'An extraterrestrial origin has never been proven for any of these cases, ever.'

Another theory floated by pilot Scott Batzel to Lake View Patch is that the ice dropped because on a plane flying overhead.

Batzel told the website 'There’s a slight possibility the ice-ball fell from an airplane. It’s not a common occurrence but it does happen from time to time. It’s very likely that many arriving airplanes were operating in that vicinity Tuesday.'

Batzel also said 'Some airplanes use potable water to flush the lavatory toilets. Normally the flushed waste is collected in a storage tank but if the tank was leaking, ice could have built up on the outside of the plane and eventually broke free.'
