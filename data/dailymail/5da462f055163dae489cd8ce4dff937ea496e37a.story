A North Carolina man who authorities believe sexually abused an eight-year-old girl in a child pornography video was arrested on Thursday. 

William Akers, 46, was taken into custody after authorities released a still image from the video and asked for the public to help identify him.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations kicked off a nationwide manhunt that brought more than 80 leads before one member of the public was able to tell investigators where Akers was employed.

William Akers, 46, was arrested Thursday in Raleigh, North Carolina for allegedly sexually abusing an eight-year-old girl in a child pornography video seized by authorities 

He was arrested at 1am while working the night shift at Lulu Press in Raleigh, where he was a development and operations director, according to WNCN.  

One employee told the station that Akers has since been fired.  

Authorities obtained the child pornography video Akers allegedly appeared in while investigating convicted sex offender Bailey Mills and his wife Elizabeth last year, according to the News & Observer. 

The Mills identified the man in the video as Peter Gilbert, but investigators soon realized he was using an alias. 

Homeland Security Investigations reached out to the public on Wednesday, asking them to help find a 'white male, 40 to 50 years in age' who 'may be using the name Peter Gilbert and may be driving a white pickup truck'.

Both Bailey and Elizabeth Mills were arrested last year for running a child porn ring disguised as a daycare out of their Sanford home, according to investigators. 

Bailey Mills was caught after a 12-year-old girl revealed to authorities he had contacted her on Facebook about exchanging money for sex, according to WNCN. 

The young girl also told officers she had previous sexual relations with Mills, and that she had been shown pornography featuring another underage girl while at his home. 

Bailey and Elizabeth Mills were arrested after investigators found photographic and video evidence that showed multiple underage children being sexually assaulted by adult males and an adult female. 

The victims were between one and 14 years old. 

Both Bailey and Elizabeth Mills pleaded guilty to multiple sex offense charges.  

Among Bailey Mills' charges were rape of a child and sexual exploitation of a child. 

Elizabeth Mills was also charged with sexual exploitation of a child and statutory sex offense with a child.

Akers has been charged with production of child pornography and conspiracy to produce child pornography, a Homeland Security Investigations spokesman told Daily Mail Online. 

He is being held without bond at Wake County Jail. 

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement director Sarah R. Saldaña said she was grateful for the public's 'quick action' to help find Akers. 

'Within hours of our request for assistance, more than a million people took notice and started spreading the word on social media and in the press,' she said in a statement. 

'Because of this incredible support, we were able to identify and arrest a man accused of grossly violating an innocent child.' 

The investigation was conducted under Homeland Security Investigations Operation Predator, an international initiative to protect children from sexual predators.
