China has seen the first successful flight of a commercial airplane powered by what's probably the country's biggest threat to food safety - waste cooking oil.

The Boeing 737-800 aircraft, operated by Hainan Airlines, flew around 100 passengers from Shanghai to Beijing. 

It meant China joined a handful of countries in the world that possess the research and development ability to create its own biofuel production technology, according to the People's Daily Online.

But the fact that the new fuel was developed from waste cooking oil - which is in all too plentiful supply in China, leading to many problems with blocked drains and sewers - has prompted excitement in the country.

Apart from the environmental concerns surrounding the dumping of cooking oil, there is also widespread concern about how much of it ends up on dining tables around the country after unscrupulous dealers remove it from drains and sell it back to retailers. 

The carrier informed all the passengers before departure that the aircraft would use a new type of fuel.

'The flight was very smooth. I didn't experience anything unusual,' said Pu Ming, Vice President of Hainan Airlines who was also a passenger on the flight. 'I hope the biofuel could be promoted throughout the country.'

'When I was asked on the phone whether or not I would mind flying with a plane using biofuel, I said of course I wouldn't. I'd love to be a lab mouse,' said one passenger named Ms Zhong.

'The successful flight is a landmark and on one hand the low carbon biofuel significantly reduces greenhouse gasses which helps China realise its 2020 carbon dioxide emissions per GDP by 40-50 per cent,' said Lu Dapeng, spokesman of China Sinopec.

'On the other hand, it could help with altering the route of catering waste oil and help stop the danger of it from ending up on the dinner table.'

Produced by Sinopec, China's state-owned oil and gas company, this particular biofuel uses restaurant waste cooking oil, often known as the 'gutter oil' in China, as the raw material.

The cooking oil is then blended at a one-to-one ratio with ordinary jet fuel to create the finished product.

Animal fat is the reason why waste cooking oil can be turned into biofuel.

Sinopec has spent the past five years researching and developing biofuel, according to researcher Xu Hui, who also stated that the price of biofuel is two to three times more expensive than normal aviation fuel due to the cost of the raw material.

Apart from animal fat-based biofuel, China is also developing sugar-based and starch-based biofuels, whose prices are expected to be 15-80 per cent of normal aviation fuel.

Waste cooking oil is often collected by underground dealers in China. It's then reprocessed in rudimentary means and will return to millions of dining tables.

However, many airlines in China are reluctant to use biofuel due to its high cost, reported People's Daily Online.
