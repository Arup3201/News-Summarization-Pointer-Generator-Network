A teenage thug who was caught on CCTV torturing two husky dogs has been jailed for 17 weeks by a judge who told him: 'I wouldn't trust you with a goldfish'.

William Legget, 19, of Bedminster, Bristol, tied adult dog Balue to a bannister and punched, stamped and kicked her before turning on his puppy Nala, who he beat and threatened with a knife.

The older dog escaped serious injury but Nala suffered a broken hip, jaw, cheek and a fractured skull.

District Judge Lynne Matthews jailed Legget for 17 weeks after telling him he was 'not a decent human being'.

She said she was 'staggered' by his cruelty and imposed a life ban on him keeping any animals, adding she 'would not trust him with a goldfish'.

She also said the case should be reported to social services after hearing that Legget had a young child.

Bristol Magistrates' Court heard the beatings took place at Legget's former home in Gravesend, Kent, in February last year.

When he was arrested Legget told police the dogs had been 'naughty' and said his only fault was not knowing when to 'stop telling them off.'

Judge Matthews said: 'With the puppy it wasn't a slight fracture but the bone has broken away.

'The veterinary surgeon said that break was a result of extreme force. You applied that extreme force.'

Legget admitted three counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal and two counts of failing to protect it from pain, suffering and injury. 

John Stokes, defending, said his client had both emotional and behavioural problems but had a partner and a young child to look after.

Legget was jailed for 17 weeks. Both dogs have now been re-homed.
