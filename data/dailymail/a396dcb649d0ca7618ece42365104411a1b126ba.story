Though no stranger to crude humour, several tweets by American Pie star Jason Biggs have gotten him in hot water.

During last week’s Republican National Convention, he made several extremely vulgar tweets about the wives of presidential candidate Mitt Romney and vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan, causing an outcry on the microblogging site.

And because Biggs now works for children’s entertainment network Nickelodeon as the voice of Leonardo in the upcoming Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series, the company was forced to issue an apology.

During last week’s RNC, Biggs was one of millions of Americans watching Mitt and Ann Romney take the stage. But unlike those millions, he tweeted a series of extremely vulgar things about the candidates’ wives.

MailOnline has chosen to not publish images of the tweets, which have since been deleted from Biggs’ account. 

The official publicity Twitter account to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles mentioned Biggs’ account on September 1, encouraging followers to visit his site.

Mediate reports that Fox News host Megyn Kelly picked up on his shocking comments, and was appalled by the actor’s tweets. She called him a ‘disgusting pig’ on the air.

Parental groups and conservatives 
then took to the warpath, calling for Biggs to be fired from his spot on
the upcoming Nickelodeon television series. 

On
Wednesday, Nickelodeon issued a statement on the drama, saying: ‘The 
offensive comments made by Jason Biggs last week on his personal twitter
account do not reflect our company’s views or values, and we condemn 
them.

‘Nickelodeon does not support or condone the use of graphic or vulgar language on any of our platforms. It was our mistake to link from our Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles twitter feed to Jason’s personal twitter account, and we quickly corrected our error. 

‘We also insisted Jason use better judgment and discretion in public communications while affiliated with our brand.’

But that apology wasn’t good enough for Kelly, who said on air after the statement was released: ‘Does that do it? It’s not like he made one comment that he can dial back.’

Parent’s groups have since been lobbying for advertisers on the show to pull their support.

A similar issue popped up last year after parent’s groups took a target on another Viacom-owned station, MTV.

The station that once was a haven for music videos adapted an American version of the racy U.K. series Skins. Several major advertisers pulled out after the show was lambasted for its racy content.
