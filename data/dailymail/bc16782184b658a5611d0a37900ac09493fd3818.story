Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been condemned on social media after he described job losses under the Labor government as a 'holocaust of jobs'.

In parliament on Thursday, he used the term - which means destruction or slaughter on a mass scale but which has become inextricably linked to the Nazi genocide in which approximately six million Jews died - to the loss of defence jobs when Labor were in power.

'Under members opposite defence jobs in this country declined by 10 per cent. There was a holocaust of jobs, a holocaust of jobs in defence industries under members opposite,' Mr Abbott said.

'That's what there was, Madam Speaker, jobs, jobs - I'm sorry and I withdraw, Madam Speaker.'

Mr Abbott subsequently apologised and withdrew the comment. He replaced the word 'holocaust' with 'decimation'. 

NSW Jewish Board of Deputies Chief Executive Officer Vic Alhadeff told Daily Mail Australia that because Mr Abbott 'immediately withdrew' his comment and 'immediately corrected it' there was not an issue.

'It would have been an issue if it was not withdrawn, he certainly did the right thing.'

But on Twitter, the prime minister's use of the word was blasted.

Journalist at The Australian Peter van Onselen wrote: 'Somebody should shirtfront the PM for that holocaust line. No suppository of wisdom saying it. Am I critical? You bet you are, you bet I am.'

Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Tony Abbott says he feels 'no guilt whatsoever' about the way children have been dealt with in Australian immigration detention centres

Lesley Plummer said Abbott's job was 'gone' after that remark 

Tony Abbott's choice of language was quickly pointed out despite him correcting himself 

Earlier Thursday, Mr Abbott used tough language on another topic, telling a radio interviewer who asked if he had any guilt about the detention of children in immigration centres that he had, 'None whatsoever.'

The question was prompted by a new Human Rights Commission report that found children in the centres are suffering mental and physical affects because of their detention.

Mr Abbott went on to say that 'of course' he would like the children to be released, but attacked the commission for politicising the issue.

Buzzfeed Australia reporter Mark Di Stefano commented: 'It was the killing six million Jewish people of job losses.'

Another Twitter user asked the PM: 'Are you on something or just more incomparably stupid than I already believed?'

Mark Simpson wrote: 'Wow, I can't believe it, but @TonyAbbottMHR actually seems to be getting stupider today.'

Robert Knox said that despite Mr Abbott's apology, the comment was 'still a very inappropriate comment for a PM to make, mouth works faster than the brain'.

Mr Abbott made the comparison after attacking former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. 

'Madam Speaker, I know members opposite do not like being reminded of their comprehensive and monumental failure, but we will remind them of the mess and chaos they created every day, every single day, and, Madam Speaker, seven years ago,

'Eight years ago now, nine years ago now, Madam Speaker, Kevin Rudd, the former prime minister, promised, he absolutely promised categorically that the subs would be built in SA without a tender, without a tender, and then did absolutely nothing for six years.

'Madam Speaker, members opposite want to know about jobs? Members opposite want to know about jobs. Under members opposite defence jobs in this country declined by 10 per cent,' Mr Abbott said.
