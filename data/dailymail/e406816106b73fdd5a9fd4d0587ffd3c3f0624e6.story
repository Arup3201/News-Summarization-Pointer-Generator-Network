Greek Deputy Prime Minister Giannis Dragassakis

Greece could run out of money by the end of the month after Germany rejected a ‘Trojan horse’ bid for breathing space on its massive debts.

Berlin threw out a proposal from the new far-Left government in Athens for a six-month extension on its eurozone loan agreement.

Greece’s Deputy Prime Minister Giannis Dragassakis said: ‘It appears that there are powers that would like Greece on its knees, exactly so they can impose their will.’ 

Last night there were growing signs of an unprecedented split between Brussels and Berlin over the crisis triggered by the victory of the anti-austerity party Syriza in Greece’s general election.

Minutes before it was torpedoed by Berlin, the European Commission had called the Greek request ‘positive’. 

Athens finally requested a six-month extension to its eurozone loan agreement, offering major concessions as it was confronted with the prospect of bankruptcy.

But a document setting out Germany’s position, seen by the Reuters news agency, said the Greek proposal was ‘totally unclear how the Greek government wants to pay its bills over the coming weeks with the current shortfall in tax receipts’.

Greece’s request ‘rather represents a Trojan horse, intending to get bridge financing and in substance putting an end to the current programme’.
