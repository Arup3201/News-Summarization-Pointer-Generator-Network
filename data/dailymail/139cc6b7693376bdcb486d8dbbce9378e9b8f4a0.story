Socceroos head coach Ange Postecoglou has shown faith in Australia-based soccer players, naming 10 Australian-based players in the 30-man 2014 FIFA World Cup preliminary squad.

From those selected in the 30-man squad, 22 players started their careers in the Hyundai A-League.

While injuries played a major part in the squad's selection, Postecoglou's desire to rejuvenate the ailing Socceroos is reflected in the mix of younger Australian players with more seasoned players currently working overseas.

'Weâ€™ve named 30 players for the camp and will leave Australia with 27 before cutting the squad to 23 before the first game but we want all 30 players and the staff to get a meaningful experience out of the camps and World Cup,' Postecoglou said.

Three members of the preliminary squad will be cut after the Socceroos play South Africa at Sydney's ANZ Stadium on Monday 26 May.

The team will depart for the FIFA World Cup in Brazil two days after the friendly clash - where they'll face defending champion Spain, 2010 World Cup runner-up the Netherlands and the always formidable Chile.

The final 23-man squad will be announced on 2 June.

The team's selection hasn't come without controversy.

Defender Bailey Wright, currently playing for Preston North End in England, was one of six players from the League One club arrested in April, following a spot-fixing investigation.

Defending his selection of the defender, Postecoglou said, 'He's only a young man beginning his career.'

Making note of the injury cloud that has shrouded his selection, the Socceroos coach said the 21-year-old is in 'good, solid form,' after playing almost 50 games this year.
