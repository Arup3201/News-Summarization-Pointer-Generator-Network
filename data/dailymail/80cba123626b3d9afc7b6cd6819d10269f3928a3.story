Iran's state TV broadcaster was taken off air in the UK today after Britain's media regulator revoked its licence in a move likely to fan diplomatic tensions with the Islamic Republic.

Ofcom ruled that Press TV, whose presenters include former MP George Galloway and Tony Blair's sister-in-law Lauren Booth, failed to declare that Tehran rather than London was its editorial base when it was granted the licence.

The watchdog said it was apparent that 'editorial control of the channel rested with Press TV International (based in Tehran)'.

Press TV was also fined Â£100,000 after broadcasting an interview with a journalist while they were being held in an Iranian prison, which Ofcom said was 'obtained under duress'.

Ofcom said Press TV had 'indicated it is unwilling and unable to pay' the fine.

The move is likely to stoke further anger in Iran after Britain shut the country's embassy in London and expelled all its staff in November in retaliation at protesters who stormed the British embassy in the Iranian capital.

Venting his anger, Mr Galloway tweeted today: 'Champions of liberty the British govt have now taken Press TV off Sky.'

The channel, which is funded by the Iranian government, says on its website that it has a vision of 'heeding the often neglected voices and perspectives of a great portion of the world'.

This is not the first time it has fallen foul of Ofcom. A phone-in TV programme presented by Mr Galloway was criticised by the broadcasting watchdog for breaching impartiality rules in 2010.

Ofcom investigated after Mr Galloway's weekly, one-hour English-language programme, Comment, sparked complaints that it was biased against Israel.

The regulator concluded that 'due impartiality' had not been maintained in individual programmes or across the series.

Its English-language service was removed from Sky TV's satellite platform today as a result of the latest decision, but will still be available online.

Ofcom said it had offered Press TV the chance to 'have its operations in Tehran correctly licensed' but the channel failed to respond to the offer.

In a letter published earlier this month, the channel's chief executive, Mohammad Sarafraz, said Ofcom was part of 'a desperate effort to silence an alternative voice in the UK'.

He wrote: 'It is evident that the British Government's campaign against Press TV has its roots in the channel's extensive coverage of the multiple crises created by London's domestic and foreign policies.'

Press TV International's presenters have also included former London Mayor Ken Livingstone and Yvonne Ridley, the former Sunday Express journalist kidnapped by the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001.

It said it 'will do everything possible to make sure that its voice will definitely reach its audience in the UK' and claimed it had been targeted because it 'aired critical views regarding Britain's involvement in wars of aggression in Iraq and Afghanistan'.
