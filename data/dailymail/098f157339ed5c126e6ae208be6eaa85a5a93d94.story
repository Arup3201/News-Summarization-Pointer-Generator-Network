Viewers are used to Jon Snow’s sober presence on the nightly news. But they might be shocked if they knew what was going through his mind.

The veteran Channel 4 host has confessed he thinks of sex every time he meets a woman.

And he says he likes to consider ‘what could be’ with his female friends and co-workers.

Insisting it is a ‘natural animal element of sustaining life’ for men to think of all women as potential sexual partners, he said being a man was ‘all about women’.

'An interesting barrier': Jon Snow said the urge to consider women potential partners is 'parked' once you work together or become friends

Now married to a woman 27 years his junior, the 66-year-old also opened up about his own romantic past, revealing he once had an affair with a librarian nearly twice his age while at sixth-form college.

‘Sex comes into every evaluation of a woman, there’s no doubt about it. It’s there,’ he said in a newspaper interview.

‘Once you’ve established a friendship or a working relationship with a woman, it’s parked. But it’s an interesting barrier. When you’ve gone through it and arrived at the other side, it’s never a problem again.

‘Well I’m not saying it is a problem at all, it’s rather a delicious thing really, “what might have been” or “what could be”.’

Snow said he believed sex played a ‘different role in different men’s personas’, adding: ‘We are defined by women: They give birth to us and then they define us, although lots try to ignore it.’

'Defined': Snow said that women are an inescapable influence on men's personalities. He is pictured left with his wife, Precious Lunga, and right at a Paralympic ceremony in 2012

No doubt many men will agree with his frank analysis of the male psyche. But what the women in Snow’s life will make of his comments can only be guessed at.

As a TV news presenter he has worked alongside several well-known women, including former ITN anchor Julia Somerville, 66, and former Channel 4 reporter Samira Ahmed, 45, who quit in 2011 claiming that bosses had treated her in a sexist manner.

Among his current roster of co-hosts is presenter Cathy Newman, 39, and the programme’s social affairs editor Jackie Long.

Snow has had an eventful romantic life. He was once briefly engaged to fellow ITN journalist Anna Ford, 70, and has two children with former partner Madeleine Colvin, 64.

And proving that age is no barrier to love, he married 39-year-old  Zimbabwean-born academic Precious Lunga in March 2010. Snow said her ‘mental age’ was far higher than his, saying: ‘She’s somewhere in her forties. She’s very, very mature. I mean, she’s a serious boffin.’

Revealing he once had an affair with a much older librarian while a sixth-former at Scarborough Tech, he said: ‘I was warned off by my lecturer, who told me I was very unwise to be seen going off in the lunch hour in the librarian’s car.’

The presenter made his comments to the London Evening Standard as he prepared to chair a debate on fatherhood.

He insisted he was a strong supporter of women’s equality in the workplace, but admitted he had not done as much as he could have to promote his female colleagues.

He said: ‘While I aspire to be a feminist, I think I am guilty of just as many failings in terms of supporting women’s equality. I couldn’t say I’d really fought for women to enjoy many of the fantastic benefits I’ve enjoyed.’
