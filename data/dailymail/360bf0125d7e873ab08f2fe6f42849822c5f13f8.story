Micah Richards rejected a loan move to a Premier League club in favour of Serie A, the on-loan Manchester City defender has revealed.

Out of favour Richards made a loan switch to Fiorentina on transfer deadline day after Manuel Pellegrini made it clear he was not in his plans for the coming season at the Etihad.

And amid talk that West Ham and a number of other Premier League clubs were interested in the versatile defender, Richards has claimed he rejected the chance to stay in England in favour of a Serie A move.

'This was the most exciting project and fantastic fans,' Richard told Sky Italia.

'I had options between the Premier League and Serie A, but I chose Fiorentina because this was the most interesting project and the fans are fantastic.'

Richards is yet to play for his new club but has been training with their squad and he praised the impact of former City defender Stefan Savic, now also at the Florence club.

'The directors convinced me, there are great players and I spoke about it to Savic, who I knew from City,' he said.

'I am really getting into Italian football. I feel right at home already.'
