MTV network has cancelled the reality show Buckwild just one week after the tragic passing of cast member Shain Gandee.

Sources close to the series told TMZ early Wednesday morning that MTV made the decision to pull the plug on the show mid-production of season two.

The program has been following the lives of nine young people living in rural West Virginia.

Gandee, 21, his 48-year-old uncle, David Gandee, and 27-year-old friend Donald Robert Myers were found dead April 1 in an SUV that was partially submerged in a deep mud pit near Sissonville.

Autopsies determined that all three died of carbon monoxide poisoning, possibly caused by the vehicle's tailpipe being submerged in mud.

The move to cancel the show came on the heels of Gandee’s funeral Sunday, during which hundreds of camouflage-clad friends and fans gathered to honor the life of MTV’s newest breakout star.

TMZ reported that producers did not cite any specific reason for the cancellation of the show. MTV is expected to make an official announcement later in the day Wednesday.

Four episodes of the second season were shot but will not be aired. However, the network will show a special that was taped two months ago.

Fame: Shain, nicknamed 'Gandee Candy' by fans, was a breakout star of Buckwild. The show followed the antics of a group of young friends enjoying their wild country lifestyle

Shain, nicknamed 'Gandee Candy' by 
fans, was a breakout star of the show that followed the antics of a 
group of young friends enjoying their wild country lifestyle.

It was 
filmed last year, mostly around Sissonville and Charleston.

For all his on-camera carousing and cussing, Gandee was a publicly proclaimed and baptized Christian, and his mother told hundreds of mourners on Sunday that she will see him again.

Gandee favored four-wheelers, pickups 
and SUVs over cell phones and computers, and 'mudding,' or off-road 
driving, was one of his favorite pastimes.

Shooting was under way on season two 
at the time of Gandee's death, but MTV spokesman Jake Urbanski said film
crews were not with him over Easter weekend and hadn't filmed him since
earlier that week.

MTV originally said it will be at least a few weeks before producers and cast members decide whether to continue with the show. Meanwhile, grief counselors were made available for the cast, crew and their families.

At the time, Charleston Mayor Danny 
Jones urged MTV to pull the plug on Buckwild, claiming that 'the show 
only enhanced the negative stereotype the Kanawha Valley already has,' according to The Hollywood Reporter.

MTV said the half-hour series in the 
old Jersey Shore time slot was pulling in an average of 3.2million 
viewers per episode since its premiere and was the No. 1 original cable 
series on Thursday nights among 12- to 34-year-olds.Gandee and seven of his fellow cast members renegotiated their contracts to get a 300 per cent raise, going from being paid $1,000 per episode in Season 1 to $4,000 in the second season, plus a $5,000 bonus.

According to one insider, on the day of Gandee's death, MTV executives discussed possibly 'softening' the show by focusing less on such on risky behavior as off-roading and tire roll-downs, but that idea was ultimately rejected for fear of alienating viewers.

Shock: Friends and neighbors walked up the gravel road leading to Shain Gandee's home in Sissonville, West Virginia after hearing of his death on April 1

A friend of Shain's said he would have loved the sea of camouflage that filled the auditorium for his funeral. 'He probably would walk in there going, BUCKWILD!' Ricky Sater, 23, claimed
