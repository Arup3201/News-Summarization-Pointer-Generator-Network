Kick It Out chairman Lord Ouseley has issued a damning assessment of football following the revelations by Sportsmail of Malky Mackay and Iain Moody's shocking text messages, claiming that the game is 'tainted with racism, sexism, homophobia and antisemitism'.

Ouseley called on the Football Association to stop 'shirking' responsibility and punish anyone guilty of harbouring such attitudes, and even accused the governing body of knowing about racists at the very top of the game and yet still taking no action.

Sportsmail excusively revealed on Thursday that Mackay and Moody have been reported to the FA and accused of being racist, sexist and homophobic in a series of texts dating back to their time together at Cardiff.

'Kick It Out is aware but not shocked to hear of reports revealing alleged racist, antisemitic, sexist and homophobic comments made by former Cardiff City manager Malky Mackay, and Iain Moody, the former Sporting Director at Crystal Palace,' said Lord Ouseley.

'These revelations are further confirmation of how football is tainted with racism, sexism, homophobia and antisemitism, and the culture which continues to exist throughout the game and in wider society as a whole.

'The reality is that these views are most dangerously held by those people in positions of power, and the football establishment knows and condones it.'

After months of investigation, Sportsmail revealed the details of two letters sent to the FA outlining explicit and offensive texts.

These messages came to light after a dawn raid on Moody’s south London home in March this year, as part of Cardiff’s £750,000 investigation into eight controversial transfers.

Around 70,000 text messages and 100,000 emails were allegedly recovered, including the text and email exchanges that form the basis of letters sent to the FA.

Exclusive: Chief Sports Reporter Matt Lawton's story in Thursday's Daily Mail

Revelation: Sportsmail broke the story of Mackay and Moody's text message

The letters to the FA make reference to the following alleged offensive communications between Moody, Mackay and others:

Front-runner: Mackay was expected to be given the vacant manager's role at Crystal Palace

Revealed: Moody's house was raided as part of an investigation into Cardiff's transfers while he was at the club

Lord Ouseley said that anyone who expressed such views should take responsibility for their actions, even if they were made in private and then became public.

The chairman of the anti-racism campaign group also called on football's administrators and clubs stamp out racial prejudice and discrimination.  

'This familiar scenario acts as a challenge to the leadership of football that cannot be shirked again,' he said.

'The governing bodies and the clubs must denounce such attitudes prevalent in the game, and take the appropriate action.

'If these types of exchanges made privately make it into the public eye, the individuals concerned must accept the full consequences of their actions.

'Kick It Out now awaits the outcome of The Football Association's investigation.'

Racial slur: Mackay is alleged to have bad-mouthed incoming South Korean international Kim Bo-Kyung

Caught: Mackay is also said to have called a club official a 'gay snake' and sent a picture of 'Black Monopoly'

Peculiar: Mackay dropped his suit for wrongful dismissal at Cardiff, strangely apologising to owner Vincent Tan

Mackay, the former Cardiff manager, and Moody, the club’s former head of recruitment, appeared to be on the verge of being reunited at Crystal Palace, with Mackay thought to be replacing Tony Pulis.

But it is understood Mackay dropped out of the running after Palace learned of the evidence that has been passed to Wembley officials and on Thursday morning Moody resigned as Palace’s director of football following the revelations.

'What you see at face value is not always reflective of the attitudes which are actually held deep down,' added Lord Ouseley. 'It's easy to present yourself as being reasonable and fair, and to behave in ways that hide prejudice and bias.

'However, any in-depth forensic examination or analysis of hidden views would be likely to reveal otherwise. That is what makes it difficult to eliminate and eradicate such prejudices, bigotry and even hatred.'

May 2010: Vincent Tan is the new owner of Cardiff City.

June 2011: After Dave Jones is sacked following a Championship play-off semi-final defeat, Malky Mackay is appointed manager.

February 2012: Mackay leads Cardiff to their first League Cup final, which they lose to Liverpool on penalties following a 2-2 draw after extra time.

May 2012: Cardiff lose in the play-off semi-final again, but Mackay retains his post.

Tan controversially decides that the club’s shirts should be changed from blue to red and the traditional bluebird emblem swapped for a dragon — causing huge unrest among the Cardiff supporters.

September 2012: Tan replaces the club’s chief executive, Alan Whiteley (left), with associate Simon Lim.

April 2013: Cardiff secure promotion to the Premier League, finishing top of the Championship.

August 2013: After around £35million is spent in preparation for life in the top flight, Tan publicly tells Mackay to ensure there is a positive return on his investment.

October 2013: Mackay’s head of recruitment, Iain Moody, with whom he had worked at Watford, is replaced by 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov (right), reportedly on work experience, although he is unable to take the job on visa grounds.

December 16: Cardiff beat West Brom in the Premier League and Mackay suggests to the Press that he will need three players in the January transfer window. Lim releases a statement on behalf of Tan that criticises Mackay for his comments and asserts that he will not be given ‘a single penny’ for transfers.

December 19: Mackay is emailed by Tan, informing him to either resign from his position or be sacked.

December 22: Cardiff release a club statement that Mackay will remain as manager ‘for the foreseeable future’.

December 26: Cardiff lose 3-0 at home to Southampton, as fans stage a protest against Tan.

December 27: Mackay is eventually dismissed as Cardiff manager.

The LMA wish to clarify the position in relation to recent reports and speculation regarding matters alleged to have arisen during Malky Mackay’s time at Cardiff City FC.

In the course of a search by the Club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff during Mr Mackay’s employment at Cardiff, in relation to other matters, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures. These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter. That said, Malky believes he could and should have conducted himself better on these two isolated occasions. The precise details need to remain private for the time being until any FA process is complete.

The LMA does not condone in any way any potential breach of equal opportunities laws but would also point out that out of over 10,000 text messages and 70,000 documents produced over a long period of time it may not be a complete surprise that some inappropriate comments can sometimes be made by employees, like Malky, working under great pressure in highly charged situations. If Malky has caused any offence by these two isolated matters he would, however, wish to sincerely apologise.

Malky finds it strange that these matters were only raised with the FA and in the media now, 8 months after his employment ended and the day before he was reported as being offered the opportunity to become manager of Crystal Palace FC.

Malky is also very concerned about seriously inaccurate and misleading reports of his alleged involvement in these matters in the media. It has never been alleged that he wrote any homophobic or sexist messages and he has confirmed that he did not do so. Further, there are incorrect and damaging suggestions that he sent a whole host of offensive and unpleasant messages that are simply not true and which give a grossly distorted and unfair view of Malky’s involvement in this matter. Malky looks forward to matters being put straight in due course, following any investigation of this matter.

Malky cannot of course comment on the nature of any conduct or communications alleged to have been made by others.

Malky has said that he will be fully co-operating with any FA investigation and that he looks forward to putting the record straight thereafter.
