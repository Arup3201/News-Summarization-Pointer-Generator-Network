An episode of the BBC's Frozen Planet documentary series that looks at climate change has been scrapped in the U.S., where many are hostile to the idea of global warming.

British viewers will see all seven episodes of the multi-million-pound nature series throughout the Autumn.

But U.S. audiences will not be shown the last episode, which looks at the threat posed by man to the natural world.

It is feared a show that preaches global warming could upset viewers in the U.S., where around half of people do not believe in climate change.

Sir David Attenborough presents and authors the 'On Thin Ice' episode. It looks at how the planet's ice is changing and what it means not only to the animals and people at the Poles but also the rest of the planet

The series of six episodes has been sold to 30 countries, including China, one of the world's biggest polluters.

World TV networks have the option to buy a seventh 'companion' episode, along with behind-the-scenes footage.

Ten of the countries have chosen not to use the final episode on climate change

In the U.S., Frozen Planet is being aired by Discovery. They were involved in the joint-production of the series. Yet they are still refusing to accommodate Frozen Planet in its entirety.

The timing of a one-sided global warming programme could be particularly sensitive in the U.S., where climate change is an issue in the presidential race.

GOP presidential candidate Rick Perry accuses climate scientists of lying for money.

A poll earlier this year found that the majority of Americans believe that if climate change does exist, it is not caused by humans.

Fifty-three per cent of Republicans say there is no evidence of climate change, while the number is far higher among Tea Party supporters, with 70 per cent saying the theory is 'junk science' pushed by groups with a vested interest.

Sir David Attenborough presents and authors the series, the seventh episode of which, entitled 'On Thin Ice', looks at how the planet's ice is changing and what it means not only to the animals and people at the Poles but also the rest of the planet.

In mother's footsteps: More than 30 international networks have bought the Frozen Planet series

The series examines various aspects of the polar wilderness over the seasons and follows the lives of creatures from polar bears and wolves in the Arctic to killer whales and penguins in the Antarctic

A spokesman for the BBC said it would not make sense to force television networks outside the UK to buy the episode as it features 
85-year-old Sir David talking a lot of the time to camera, and in
 many parts of the world he is not famous.

The broadcaster refused to say which 
countries had shunned 'On Thin Ice'. They said it wasn't included in the
 main package because it features Sir David 'in vision' which would make
 it hard for other countries to translate into their own language.

Discovery had dropped the full seventh episode due to 'scheduling issues', the spokesman added.

However, environmentalists branded the decision 'unhelpful'.

Harry Huyton, head
 of climate change for the RSPB, accused networks who haven't bought the final episode of
 'censoring the issue'.

A Greenpeace spokesman said: 'Climate change is the most important part of our polar story.'

The show cost an estimated Â£16million and took four years to make and has proved hugely popular.

It examines various aspects of the polar wilderness over the seasons and follows the lives of creatures from polar bears and wolves in the Arctic to killer whales and Adelie penguins in the Antarctic.

It has been produced by the BBC's Natural History Unit in Bristol in conjunction with the Discovery Channel and The Open University.

The climate change episode will be aired on December 7 at 9pm.
