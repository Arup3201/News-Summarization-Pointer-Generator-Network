A Louisiana man whose frantic arrest was captured on a video that has gone viral said he was wrongfully arrested, while authorities maintain he was taken into custody for resisting an officer.

Donrell Breaux, 26, of River Ridge, was arrested after refusing to provide identification and then attempting to go inside his residence, according to Col. John Fortunato, spokesman for the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office.

But Breaux said he feels the arrest was unlawful and questioned the relationship between the responding deputy and the neighbor with which he had a dispute, according to New Orleans newspaper The Times-Pacayune.

'I knew he (the deputy) was a personal friend (of the neighbor) and I thought it was an unlawful arrest,' Breaux said.

The man in the video, Donrell Breaux, 26, can be heard continually telling the officer he is scared and doesn't know why he is being treated in such a way

River Ridge police released a statement over the video, saying they believe the officer involved acted in a correct and lawful manner

'I don't have to submit to an unlawful arrest.'

Part of the encounter was recorded by Breaux's friend, Eric Banegas, and posted on Facebook on April 1 and YouTube soon after.

It has been shared than 37,800 times.

The incident occurred in the 200 block of Marmandie Avenue in River Ridge.

A resident called 911 just before 3 p.m. to report that a man at a neighboring home was cursing at him, Fortunato said.

The resident told the responding deputy that he was sitting outside with his wife and children when he overheard people at the residence using profanity.

He said a man later identified as Breaux began directing 'profanity-laced sentences' at him and his wife and children after he asked them several times to stop, Fortunato said.

In addition to the profanity, the neighbor told the responding deputy that he could smell marijuana coming from the area where Breaux was standing.

The deputy went over to Breaux and Banegas' residence with the intention of issuing a misdemeanor summons, Fortunato said. But he, too, smelled marijuana as he approached.

The deputy asked for identification and told the deputy he might have I.D. inside and turned to enter the house, according to Fortunato.

'After he refuses to present I.D. and tries to go into the house, now (the deputy's) going to do a physical arrest as opposed to a misdemeanor summons,' Fortunato said.

Breaux attempted to close the door on the officer and the two briefly struggled before Breaux was taken into custody, according to the Sheriff's Office.

But Breaux said he and Banegas were just cracking joke among themselves when the neighbor came outside and told them to watch their language, prompting a brief verbal confrontation.

He said the neighbor regularly calls police over minor issues, such as too many cars in the driveway.

Breaux said the officer immediately tried to arrest him and had handcuffs at the ready, which is when Banegas started filming.

He was eventually booked at the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center in Gretna with battery of a police officer, resisting arrest with violence, and disturbing the peace by using offensive, derisive or annoying words, according to an arrest report.

He was released on a $6,250 bond.

Banegas on Thursday said no one was smoking marijuana at his home, despite the allegation made by the Sheriff's Office.

Deputies did not find any evidence of marijuana in the house, according to Fortunato.

Breaux, who has been living at the Marmandie Avenue address since December, said he recognized the deputy as a friend of the neighbor.

'I've seen him at the residence before,' he said.

'These are personal friends.

'I wish I had friends that I could call and have them handle personal vendettas that I have with my neighbors.'
