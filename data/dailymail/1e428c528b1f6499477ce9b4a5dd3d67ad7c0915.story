John Terry became the latest football star to take the Ice Bucket Challenge following Chelsea's 3-1 victory over Burnley and took the opportunity to take revenge on a former manager.

The Blues captain managed to thank Ashley Cole and Stiliyan 'Stan' Petrov for nominating him before tipping a bucket of freezing water over his head and letting out a scream that would scare a banshee.

And then the veteran defender nominated Frank Lampard, John Obi Mikel... and Rafa Benitez.

You're up! John Terry nominated Frank Lampard, John Obi Mikel and former manager Rafa Benitez

It is no secret that the pair failed to see eye to eye after the Spaniard's brief tenure as 'interim manager' during the 2012-13 season when Terry lost his place in the team before being restored by Jose Mourinho.

Terry was at his commanding best on Monday as Chelsea overcame a shaky start to beat Premier League newcomers Burnley at Turf Moor.

Despite winning the Europa League that season, Benitez failed to win over the Chelsea faithful after comments made when he was Liverpool boss.

He left Stamford Bridge to find some success in winning the Coppa Italia with Serie A side Napoli.

The ice bucket challenge, social media’s latest craze, is designed to raise money and awareness for the neurodegenerative illness ALS. 

Other players to have taken the challenge include Cristiano Ronaldo, Neymar, Daniel Sturridge, Darren Fletcher and Paul Scholes.
