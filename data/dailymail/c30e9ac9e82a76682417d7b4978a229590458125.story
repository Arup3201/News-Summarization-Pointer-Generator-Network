Testing: A change in the law will mean that home HIV tests do not have to be sent to a laboratory before the result can be given

A simple home test for HIV is on the way.

At present it is illegal to test for HIV at home and read the result yourself, although people can take a sample themselves, send it off for testing in a laboratory and receive the result at a later date.

Now a change in the law will mean a saliva test will quickly give the user a ‘negative’ or a ‘positive indication’ result.

The Health Protection Agency says the number of people in the UK with the virus is at a record level of nearly 100,000.

But a quarter of people who have the human immunodeficiency virus don’t know they are infected.

Health experts hope that making the tests more readily available will help reduce infection rates.

Officials from the Department of 
Health are expected to say that home testing may help people detect 
their infection earlier on - which could lead to more effective 
treatment options and reduce the infection spreading.

Public Health Minister Anna Soubry is 
expected to say: 'The stigma and fear surrounding HIV may mean that some
people are afraid or reluctant to go to a clinic to be tested.

'I hope that by removing the ban on 
self-testing kits people will be able to choose the right time and right
surroundings to take a test and, if positive, help them get the best 
treatment available.

'Clear information on how to get immediate support 
will be provided with the kits.”

Lisa Power, policy director of the Terrence Higgins Trust, welcomed the decision, which the charity has campaigned for.

‘The response to our highly successful home sampling scheme shows many people who have never tested before, or who have put off a visit to a clinic, are willing to test at home,’ she said.

‘Anything that encourages these people to test, take control of their health and get treatment is a welcome advance.”

Unaware: Around 25,000 people in the UK are living with HIV without knowing it

Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National AIDS Trust, said: 'With around 25,000 people in the UK living with HIV without knowing it, it is vital that we offer as many options as possible to take an HIV test.

'Self-testing kits have an important role to play in reaching people who are uncomfortable or unable to test in a sexual health clinic or other healthcare setting.

'We know that some people are already buying poor quality self-testing kits online from overseas which is why NAT have campaigned for a change in the law.

'Legalisation is an important step to ensure that the tests available are accurate, safe and appropriately regulated.'
