Roy Hodgson has criticised the Football Association's decision host an NFL game at Wembley six days before England's game with Slovenia. 

The national stadium will be used for Sunday's game between the Jacksonville Jaguars and Dallas Cowboys - the third NFL game at Wembley this year. 

This has left Hodgson - whose side play Slovenia at Wembley in a European Championship qualifier on November 15 - concerned about the potential state of the pitch.

'I don't really think you could expect me to say "excellent, delighted, well done,"' said Hodgson. 'If I was asked if it was a good thing or not, I would have to say not.

'I can't pretend it is something that makes me leap for joy. The pitch, unfortunately, is not in the best of nick anyway, which we're all a bit unhappy with.'

Three more NFL games will be played at Wembley next year, one of which will take place on October 4 - five days before England's last Euro 20156 qualifier with Estonia.  

'It is a decision Wembley has made and I know the ground staff will work very, very hard to give us the best pitch they can give us,' Hodgson added.

'Hopefully in the future the pitch will recover to its normal level and when it has done that we will be better able to support this type of activity.'
