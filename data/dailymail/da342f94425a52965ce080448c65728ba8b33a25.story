Mario Balotelli has been handed a surprise recall to the Italy squad - the first time he has been selected by new manager Antonio Conte.

The misfiring Liverpool striker has come under intense scrutiny after only scoring twice since his £16million summer move from AC Milan to Anfield - neither of which goals have come in the Premier League.

The 24-year-old has not played for the Azzurri since the 2014 World Cup - the former Manchester City  has won 33 caps for Italy and scoring 13 goals during his international career.

Meanwhile, former Italy manager Arrigo Sacchi has criticised Balotelli, who was pictured leaving a London nightclub at 4.30am on Sunday following Liverpool's 2-1 defeat by Chelsea, as not being a true 'player'.

'Balotelli is not a player, because a player moves as part of a team,' Sacchi explained. 'He's just a footballer,' he said.
