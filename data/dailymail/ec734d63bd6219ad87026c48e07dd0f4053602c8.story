Briton Ian Stannard won the first classic one-day race of the season when he beat three Etixx-Quick Step riders in a tense finale to the Het Nieuwsblad on Saturday.

The Team Sky rider, who also won the race last year, was part of a four-man breakaway with Tom Boonen, Niki Terpstra and Stijn Vandenberg 43-km from the end.

Boonen and Terpstra attacked one after another but Stannard could not be dropped.

Christian Knees and Sir Bradley Wiggins of Team Sky were also in action on Saturday

The 27-year-old Englishman, whose 2014 season was plagued by injury, beat Terpstra in the final sprint to wrap up a flawless ride.

Stannard told TeamSky.com: 'I couldn't be happier. It's nice to do the double sweep at the race but, after the difficulties I had last year breaking my back, it's nice to have got myself back to where I was.'
