U.S. consumers have fallen out of love with tech giants Apple and Google, according to recent market research by YouGov BrandIndex.

The two companies have fallen off the top ten list of best-perceived brands in 2013. Google was listed at number 10 in the second half of 2012, while Apple had already dropped.

However, it doesn't seem to be technology the public has lost interest in: Amazon made two appearances in the list with its Kindle e-reader brand at number nine and Amazon, which took out the top spot for online retailing, came in at number two out of all brands.

Out of favor: Google has endured a bit of an image problem of late and is no longer ranked in the top 10 companies for consumer perception

So why have these two tech stalwarts now fallen out of favor?

Public perceptions of Google changed when its young, liberal, innovative image took a knock after the NSA revelations by Edward Snowden.

Google had been rated the fourth best-perceived brand in 2011, but after a lukewarm reception to Google+ it fell in esteem the following year.

Popularity contest: Amazon is well-perceived with consumers, featuring twice on the list thanks to its Kindle brand, but Apple has fallen off the list and recently been convicted of conspiring to fix e-book prices

Earlier this year, privacy issues and the negative coverage surrounding PRISM have seen it fall further still and left the company scrambling to retain consumer trust.

Meanwhile, Apple lost its charismatic front man Steve Jobs and then faced a chorus of disapproval over allegations of child labor in its supply chain, not to mention long-reported harsh conditions in its Chinese factories.

Most recently, the brand was convicted on
Wednesday of conspiring to raise and fix the price of e-books in an 
attempt to dominate the market leader, Amazon.

Leader: After the death of Apple CEO Steve Jobs, the brand has suffered some setbacks

Appalling conditions: A spate of suicides of Chinese workers at factories producing Apple products has created negative publicity for Apple

The company at the top of consumer perception is Ford, after a profitable year and successful promotional campaigns.

Coming in at number 10 is Cheerios, which gained positive media attention for its 'Just Checking' advertisement featuring a mixed-race family.

A few bigots created a social-media stink about the ad, which only served to make the brand more popular when General Mills stood by the campaign, saying the actors cast in the spot reflected the changing U.S. population.

The brand has also hit the mark with its healthy-eating messages.

YouTube also secured consumer approval with its strong LGBT acceptance stance and its growing role as a vehicle for major news stories such as the Paula Deen video apology, which was viewed by almost four million people.

YouGov BrandIndex measures consumer perceptions by surveying 5,000 people daily on whether theyâ€™ve heard anything good or bad about a brand in the past two weeks.
