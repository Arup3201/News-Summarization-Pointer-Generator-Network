Forget fluffy sitcoms and period dramas – the best TV programmes this year were gritty crime thrillers, according to a Radio Times poll.

The dark BBC1 police drama Happy Valley starring Sarah Lancashire as a police sergeant in the Yorkshire valleys came top of a Radio Times poll which was dominated by home-grown shows.

Doctor Who, starring Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman came ninth in the poll of this year's programmes

Line Of Duty, about a police anti-corruption unit and starring Keeley Hawes, was second while the third series of Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock completed the top three.

The Trip To Italy, Michael Winterbottom's comedy drama starring Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon, was fourth followed by US drama True Detective, featuring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson.

The Honourable Woman, starring Maggie Gyllenhaal, was next followed by Toast of London, featuring Matt Berry as an eccentric, middle-aged actor, and Detectorists, Mackenzie Crook's series about metal detecting enthusiasts.

Doctor Who - in which Capaldi starred as the Time Lord - was ninth while US import Homeland was 10th.

The annual poll was voted for by Radio Times critics.

RadioTimes.com editor Tim Glanfield said: 'The critics' top five shows that our love of quality crime and detective drama is alive and well, with both the darker, grittier side represented, in shows like Happy Valley, Line of Duty and True Detective, as well as the fun side of mystery-solving in Sherlock.

'But it's nice, too, to see a real mix in the top 10, with left-field comedies like The Trip to Italy, Toast of London and Detectorists sitting alongside political thrillers - and of course Peter Capaldi in his first outing as Doctor Who.'
