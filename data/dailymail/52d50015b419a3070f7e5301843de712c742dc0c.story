Premier League footballers are used to all sorts of bizarre commercial commitments, but Liverpool duo Daniel Sturridge and Jordan Henderson will have enjoyed their work on Friday more than most.

The two England World Cup starters were behind the counter at Subway in Boston putting together their favourite sandwiches as part a sponsorship deal.

Sturridge was seen in adverts for the huge sandwich chain before the World Cup alongside Brazilian legend Pele, and ordered his favourite 'six-inch chicken teriyaki with extra green peppers.'

And the two English talents deserved the break, with sessions under Brendan Rodgers starting to get intense as the new season approaches.

Liverpool are looking to go one better this season after just missing out on the Premier League title - although they will have to do so without the outgoing Â£75million Barcelona signing Luis Suarez.

It remains to be seen whether one of the Uruguayan's replacements, Loic Remy, will be joining his potential strike partner for a sub - although it seemed former beetroot factory worker Rickie Lambert didn't fancy any of his former produce in a sandwich and so ate elsewhere.
