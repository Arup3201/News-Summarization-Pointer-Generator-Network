MPs voted to back a 1 per cent cap on
 annual rises in benefits last night as Labour was accused of wanting to
 spend taxpayers’ money ‘like drunks on a Friday night’.

The
 opposition refused to support Government moves to save billions from 
Britain’s vast welfare bill, arguing that it was a ‘hit and run’ on 
families.

Work and Pensions
 Secretary Iain Duncan Smith claimed Labour had attempted to ‘buy votes’
 by paying tax credits to nine in every ten families with children, 
making payments to those earning up to £70,000 a year.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith challenged Labour in the Commons to explain how it would raise the £1.9billion cost of opposing the benefits cap

There were heated exchanges in the House of Commons as MPs clashed over plans to cap benefits rises at one per cent for the next three years

‘They
 spent people’s money like drunks on a Friday night,’ he told MPs. ‘They
 are the party of “spend more, borrow more, tax more and let the next 
generation pick up the bill”.’

After the vote, Prime Minister David Cameron used Twitter to declare the cap was 'fair' and accused Labour of having the wrong priorities.

The benefits now subject to a cap include:

Mr
 Duncan Smith said Labour’s refusal to back the cap for the next three 
years, a move which will save more than £2billion a year, demonstrated 
it was a ‘laughing stock’ when it came to deficit reduction.

A
 handful of Lib Dems, including former leader Charles Kennedy and 
ex-minister Sarah Teather, also failed to support the Government in a 
vote after hours of acrimonious debate.

But the legislation was carried in the Commons with a majority of 66.

After the vote, the Prime Minister used Twitter to declare the cap was 'fair' and accused Labour of having the wrong priorities.

Business
 Secretary Vince Cable, meanwhile, made an outspoken attack on his Tory 
colleagues for ‘completely unacceptable’ language suggesting the 
Government supported ‘strivers’ rather than ‘shirkers’.

He
 said there had to be a ‘tightening up’ in the welfare budget, but 
added: ‘I’m certainly very uncomfortable with some of the language which
 has been used by our Coalition partners attacking people who are out of
 work.’

Labour’s work and 
pensions spokesman Liam Byrne, who also objected to the ‘tone’ adopted 
by Tory MPs, faced acute embarrassment as it emerged that he had 
referred to ‘shirkers’ himself at least twice before.

Better off on benefits? How each April the rise in state handouts has risen by more than the average annual increase in wages. For the next three years the government will cap rises at one per cent

Labour's Ed Balls (left) and Liam Byrne, claim the benefits bill could be cut by getting more people into work

Traditionally, benefits have 
been increased in line with the rate of inflation. That prompted uproar 
last year, when the formula meant their value increased by more than 5 
per cent – at a time when many working families have had to contend with
 pay freezes or below-inflation rises.

The
 Coalition’s Welfare Benefits Uprating Bill will peg benefit rises at 1 
per cent a year for three years from next April. An impact assessment 
published by the Government suggested single parents would be most 
affected by the cap, losing £5 a week.

Working
 households in receipt of state support in the form of tax credits will 
be an average of £3 a week worse off, though the Treasury insists this 
will be more than cancelled out by a record increase in the basic rate 
income tax allowance which will come into effect in April.

Mr
 Duncan Smith said Labour had now opposed every single measure the 
Coalition has introduced to reduce the welfare bill, which has increased
 from £132billion ten years ago to £192billion – a real terms increase 
of 45 per cent.

Labour had rejected £83billion in 
welfare savings, equivalent to £5,000 in extra debt or tax rises for 
every working family. ‘They think that helping people is about trapping 
more and more people in benefits,’ Mr Duncan Smith said. ‘What a 
ridiculous nonsense they have created.’

Mr Byrne insisted seven million 
working households, as well as those out of work, will be hit by the 
Bill. ‘This is a strivers’ tax, pure and simple. It is going to hit 
people on tax credits and we oppose this strivers’ tax,’ he said.

Mr
 Byrne said he welcomed those questioning ‘the tone of this debate’, 
adding: ‘We should not reduce it to a basic division between Britain’s 
shirkers and strivers.’

But
 it later emerged that in 2011, he had told the Labour conference: ‘Many
 people on the doorstep at the last election felt that too often we were
 for shirkers not workers.’

And
 last year, he told the London School of Economics: ‘We are the Labour 
Party. The party that said that idleness is an evil. The party of 
workers, not shirkers.’

Workers in the private sector are more than £1,000 a year worse off 
than they were before the financial crisis struck, according to figures 
published today.

Take home 
pay for the average worker in a private business is now £89 less a month
 than it was in 2008 once inflation is taken into account, according to a
 report by payment experts VocaLink and the Centre for Economics and 
Business Research think tank.
