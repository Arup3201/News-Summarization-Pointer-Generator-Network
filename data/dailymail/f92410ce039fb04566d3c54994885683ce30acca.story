After the bullet hit the boy in the upper head, his mother discovered him and called authorities.

According to Harris County Sheriff's Office, the boy was inside an apartment at 6301 Sierra Blanca in Harris County just before 8pm when a gun was fired in a next-door unit. 

Deputies said the bullet pierced the wall connecting the two apartments and struck the boy in the head.

'He was laying in the bed and the bullet hit him right on the head,' a family friend, Joel Saldanas, told Click2Houston. 'When the mom came in the room she found him there bleeding. Blood all over, he was just laying there unconscious already.'
