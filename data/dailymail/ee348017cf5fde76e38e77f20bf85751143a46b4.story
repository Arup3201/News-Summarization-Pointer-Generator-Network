The woman who had her claims of being raped as a child overturned by Hillary Clinton in Arkansas in 1975 has accused the former Secretary of State of being a hypocrite.

The unnamed victim says Clinton should not be known as a champion of women's rights after the then-attorney found a way for her attacker to get off on a lesser charge and lighter sentence.

As newly released tapes of Clinton discussing the case surfaced, the woman, who was a 12-year-old virgin at the time of the attack, told the Daily Beast her character had been smeared in the trial.

Accusations: Hillary Clinton, pictured with daughter Chelsea earlier this month. The victim of a sex offender she represented has spoken out about how Clinton treated the case

She accused Clinton of misrepresenting her as a child who sought out the attention of older men and who had made false claims of abuse before. 

'Hillary Clinton took me through Hell,' 
the victim said, after hearing how Clinton had laughed as she discussed 
the trial in a recorded interview.

Legal past: Hillary Clinton, pictured in 1980, helped a man accused of child rape get a lighter sentence

Denying claims in the trial that she was 'emotionally unstable' and had a tendency to seek out older men, the victim said she would call Clinton a hypocrite if she met her again, and said she would be concerned if Clinton ran for President.

'If she 
becomes president, is she gonna be telling the world the truth? No. 
She’s going to be telling lies out there, what the world wants to hear,' the victim said.

She added that if she met her again she would tell Clinton: 'You took a 
case of mine in '75, you lied on me… I realize the truth now, the heart 
of what you’ve done to me.

'And you are supposed to be for women? You 
call that [being] for women, what you done to me? And I hear you on tape
 laughing",' the victim told the Daily Beast.

In an interview that was recorded but never released, Clinton had discussed the case, which was her first as a criminal defense lawyer.

During the course of the conversation 
which dates from the early 1980s, Clinton, then 27, outlined how she 
used a mistake by the prosecution to get 41-year-old Thomas Alfred 
Taylor a lighter sentence. 

Taylor, who died in 1992, pleaded guilty
 to unlawful fondling of a child and was sentenced to one year in 
prison, which was reduced for time served.

Shockingly, Clinton laughed as she indicated that she knew he may have been guilty, and discussed how she got him to take a lie detector test.

'I had him take a polygraph, which he passed – which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs,' Clinton said with a laugh.

Career path: Bill and Hillary in 1969. In 1975, the year the couple were married, Clinton represented Thomas Taylor in her first trial as a criminal defense lawyer

The victim said her experiences and the way she was treated in court left her scared of men for years. She never married or had children, and turned to drugs at one point.

Although she managed to get her life back on track, the woman said she remains angry at what she called a 'miscarriage of justice'.

'It’s proven fact, with all the tapes, [Clinton] lied like a dog on me. I think she was trying to do 
whatever she could do to make herself look good at the time,' th ewoman said.

'She didn’t care if those guys did it or not. I do not think 
justice was served at all.'

The woman added that before the rape trial she had never previously accused anyone of attacking or harming her.

Distressed: The victim has accused Clinton, pictured at the Children's Defense Fund's 40th anniversary last year, as a hypocrite for calling herself a champion on women's rights

She claimed that when she spoke to a Newsday reporter in 2008, she was misquoted when she said she was 'sure Hillary was just doing her job'.

'If I had known that day what I know now, I would have told him exactly what I'm telling y'all today,' she told the Daily Beast.

After hearing the tapes of Clinton discussing her case, the victim said she was moved to tears.

'[Clinton] owes me a big apology, [but] I’ll 
probably never get anything from her,' she said.
