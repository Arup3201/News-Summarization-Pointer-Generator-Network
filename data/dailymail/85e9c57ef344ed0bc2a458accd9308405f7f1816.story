A billboard advertising a kitchen along with the words, 'your wife wants me,' has New York college students urging the building and renovation company who posted the message to throw in the towel.

Infuriated students from Siena College claim that the Teakwood Builders billboard is 'sexist' and protested the sign last Tuesday afternoon.

'So it could say, 'You know you want me,' and that could include men and women. Because in today's world, men and women are the ones in the kitchen doing the cooking - not just women,' a protester standing in front of the Billboard told News 10.

Grilling the company: Students at Siena College protested this billboard for Teakwood Builders last week and claimed that the ad was sexist against women 

New phrases: Some Siena students found the billboard to be sexist and offensive, so they gathered under the billboard in protest on last  Tuesday afternoon will signs saying things like, 'I can buy my own kitchen'

Both male and female students held signs with phrases that said things like, 'men can make their own sandwiches.'

'Women left the kitchen decades ago,' and 'I can buy my own kitchen,' were also written on decorated signs.

Siena student Delaney Rivers wrote an email that said,' [The billboard] implies that men are the primary financial supporters of women and that women are materialistic and portrayed as having no other value outside of the kitchen. 

This is especially egregious towards students at our institution as many of us are working towards financial independence in hopes to have successful careers and equality in our relationships.'

Teakwood Builders did their best to assure students at the school that their advertisement was just a joke that was never meant to offend anyone.

Protesters: Students from Siena College claiming the sign was 'sexist,'  protested the billboard last Tuesday 

Just a joke?: Teakwood Builders claimed that the sign was a joke aimed 'at women with a sense of humor' but these Students who stood outside the sign to protest last Tuesday were not laughing 

'Thank you for the message regarding the report on our billboard in Newtonville. A vast majority of Teakwood’s clients are women. Frequently they are the decision makers about major expenditures. This billboard – and the entire “Your wife wants me” campaign is good-natured, tongue in cheek fun meant to appeal to women who have a sense of humor, a sense of history and healthy self-esteem,' said a response from the company sent to News 10.

Teakwood Builders went as far as thanking the students for their 'excitement about their cause' and also for 'drawing attention to the gorgeous Teakwood kitchen' on the Billboard.

Some supporters of the kitchen renovation and construction company took to Twitter to express their positive opinion about the sign's humor.

'Cancelled my wife's new kitchen and showed her this article. Thank you, IOU1 #GoingFishing,' joked Byte_Stryke.

'Anyone protesting this needs to get a life. Personally I as a wife would love to have my hubby buy this,' wrote Dawn Appelberg.
