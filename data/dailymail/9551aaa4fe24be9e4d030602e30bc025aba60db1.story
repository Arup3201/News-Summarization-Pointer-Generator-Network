George Osborne today claimed the small print of Labour's economic plan, including an extra £25billion in borrowing, poses the 'single biggest risk to the economic recovery'.

The Chancellor today challenged Labour's Ed Balls over the careful wording of his promise to run a surplus which only applies to day-to-day spending.

In a letter to Mr Balls, seen by MailOnline, Mr Osborne demanded to know how higher spending and more borrowing forever can be described as 'fiscal discipline'.

Clash: Ed Balls has been challenged by Chancellor George Osborne over his plans to borrow more money if Labour wins the next election

In a major speech at the weekend, Mr Balls insisted he would ‘’make sure the sums add up’ and warned Labour ‘cannot and will not duck the hard choices ahead’.

He declared: ‘The next Labour government will balance the books and deliver a surplus on the current budget and falling national debt in the next Parliament.’

By contrast, Tory Chancellor George Osborne has promised to balance the books on the ‘overall budget’, ensuring that money raised from taxes exceeds all government spending. Mr Osborne said in September: ‘We will have a surplus in good times as insurance against difficult times ahead.

‘Provided the recovery is sustained, our goal is to achieve that surplus in the next Parliament. That will bear down on our debts and prepare us for the next rainy day.’

Analysis by the respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank says the subtle difference means Mr Balls’ promise only covers day-to-day spending, and would allow Labour to make fewer spending cuts and borrow almost £25billion more.

It clears the way for billions more 
spending on infrastructure and housing projects, which the Tories 
seized on as proof Labour is not serious about getting a grip on the 
nation’s finances.

In his letter, Mr Osborne writes: 'As with all your announcements, the small print tells a very different story.'

He said that it is 'vital that our political debate is based on the facts' and demanded to called on him to 'confirm that you plan to borrow at least £25 billion a year indefinitely'.

Mr Osborne added: 'In what way does a policy of ‘significantly higher spending’ and budget deficits forever constitute fiscal discipline?

'Our long term economic plan is delivering growth and economic security for hardworking people. Despite your recent attempts to rebuild a reputation for fiscal responsibility, the truth that was buried in the small print is now clear: the Labour Party is the single biggest risk to the economic recovery.'

The Office for Budget Responsibility 
predicts that a future Conservative government would need to cut an 
extra £37.6 billion between 2016 and 2019 to balance the books on the 
overall budget.

However Labour would only need to cut £13billion to stick to its new rules – a difference of £24.6billion.

The Tories said the revelation was rppof that Mr Balls and Labour leader Ed Miliband would order 'more spending, more borrowing and more taxes'

Ed Balls has been accused of being 'in denial' after claiming levels of public spending before the financial crisis were not a problem.

David Cameron has seized on the remarks as proof Labour has failed to learn the lessons of running a large deficit before the crash.

In an interview on Sunday, Mr Balls said: 'Do I think the level of public spending going into the crisis was a problem for Britain? No, I don’t, nor our deficit, nor our national debt – what happened was a global financial crisis which pushed up the deficit.'

In the Commons Mr Cameron said Labour just wanted to go back to spending more money.

'We were talking earlier about our children. When our children in future turn to the dictionary and look up the definition of denial it'll be right there - Balls, Ed,' the PM said.

Gemma Tetlow, of the IFS, told The 
Times: ‘While Ed Balls and George Osborne have made rather similar 
sounding commitments to achieving a surplus in the next Parliament, 
their targets are actually very different.

‘Ed
 Balls’s commitment to achieve a surplus on the current budget would 
allow significantly higher spending on both investment and day-to-day 
items than would George Osborne’s plan.

‘The
 difference is that George Osborne plans for tax revenues to be 
sufficient to cover both day-to-day and investment spending, rather than
 just day-to-day spending as Ed Balls wants.’

Tory MP Mark Garnier, a member of the Treasury select committee, said: ‘It’s no surprise that Ed Balls has a credibility problem on the economy when an announcement designed to convince the public they can trust him uses a sleight of hand to give himself a £25 billion leeway.’

A Conservative spokesman said: ‘Labour spent, borrowed and taxed our country into a mess.

‘And now Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are proposing yet more spending, more borrowing and more taxes.

‘Nothing has changed. It's the same old Labour. They have no long-term economic plan. And that would mean a less secure future for our country and for hardworking people and their families.’

A Labour spokesperson said: ‘As we said last week Labour will deliver a surplus on the current budget and falling national debt as soon as possible in the next Parliament. This will require spending cuts, action to deliver stronger growth and fairer choices including reversing David Cameron's huge tax cut for millionaires.

‘The Tories are criticising the same measure of the deficit that George Osborne is himself targeting in this Parliament. But George Osborne has failed to balance the books as he promised because he choked off the recovery and flatlined our economy for 3 years.’

Prime Minister David Cameron refused to rule out cutting the top rate of tax from 45p

David Cameron has refused to rule out reducing the top rate of tax to 40p.

Labour leader Ed Miliband asked three times about whether a planned cut of the 45p rate is being lined up by the Government, as he probed the Prime Minister on his proposals for workers who earn more than £150,000 a year.

But Mr Cameron chose to focus on the Government's existing policies, adding that the richest people would pay more in income tax in every year under the coalition Government when compared with the previous Labour administration.

Labour has promised to return the rate to 50p if it wins the election, even though experts say it will raise hardly any extra money to tackle the deficit.

In the Commons Mr Miliband said Mr Cameron used to claim 'that the 50p tax rate was a symbol of us all being in it together and now it's gone'.

The Labour leader added: 'Now could you tell us whether you rule out cutting the top rate further to 40p?'

But Mr Cameron side-stepped the question, insisting Chancellor George Osborne had set out the Government's priorities yesterday, adding: 'We want to cut taxes for the lowest paid and for middle-income people.'
