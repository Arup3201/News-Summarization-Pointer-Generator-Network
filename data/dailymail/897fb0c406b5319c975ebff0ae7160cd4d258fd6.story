Nick Clegg yesterday said the Government must raise taxes for the better off as he rounded on Tory plans to clear the deficit by cutting welfare and public spending.

Setting out his red lines for any future coalition deal with the Tories, Mr Clegg accused David Cameron and George Osborne of ‘beating up on the poor’ and said he would insist on a raft of new taxes to help pay off the deficit.

As the party gathered in Glasgow for its annual conference, Liberal Democrat leader Mr Clegg said he wanted about 20 per cent of future deficit reduction to come from tax rises on the better off. He also accused the Tories of ‘trashing human rights’ to pander to Ukip, and that he would never accept Mr Cameron’s plan to sideline the European Court of Human Rights.

Nick Clegg said he would not allow the Tories to clear the deficit through spending cuts alone

And he shattered Coalition unity on dealing with Islamic State, saying he would block Tory plans for a Commons vote on extending British bombing raids from Iraq into Syria.

While senior Lib Dems insist they will not pull out of the Coalition, they are now focused on highlighting differences with the Tories in a desperate bid to spark a revival in their support.

The Prime Minister and Chancellor said last week that a further £25billion in cuts would be found after the election, with £3billion coming from a freeze on benefits. The Tories also announced plans to cut the benefits cap – the maximum amount any household can receive in welfare – from £26,000 to £23,000.

Mr Clegg yesterday said that he opposed both moves and would instead demand tax rises on the rich and the middle classes as the price for any new coalition deal. He said the case had not been made for ‘ratcheting down’ the welfare cap.

The Deputy Prime Minister accused his coalition partners of being ‘economically extreme’.

Asked if the Lib Dems would increase taxes to help fill the hole in the public finances, he said: ‘Yes, of course. We must raise taxes.’

The Deputy PM insisted the public wanted the Lib Dems to 'anchor' the Tories in the 'centre ground'

One senior Lib Dem voiced dismay at the intervention, saying: ‘I’m not sure we want the headline from our conference to be: Vote for us and we’ll raise your taxes.’

But Mr Clegg said voters should be clear about where the burden of tackling the huge budget deficit left by Labour would fall. He said Lib Dem plans would include ending tax relief on pensions for the better off and scrapping benefits such as the winter fuel allowance, free bus passes and free TV licences for wealthier pensioners.

And he confirmed the party was changing its original plans for a mansion tax, even referring to the flagship policy at one point as the ‘so-called mansion tax’. Aides said the policy, on which the party fought the last election, was now known internally as the ‘revaluation of high value properties with additional council tax bands’.

The mansion tax began life as a proposal to put a 1 per cent annual levy on the value of all homes above £2million. But the policy was changed this year under pressure from the party’s London MPs. It was replaced with plans for new council tax bands on properties above that value. The Lib Dems say the policy will raise £1.5billion, but have yet to set out how it will work.

Yesterday Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury, called for the introduction of a ‘fairness rule’ until the deficit was paid off. He said it would ensure the ‘best off’ have contributed the biggest share of their income to help pay down the deficit.

In an interview on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Mr Clegg accused the Conservatives of announcing with ‘almost undisguised relish’ that they would not ask the wealthiest to pay a ‘single penny towards completing the deficit reduction effort’.

He added: ‘What we are saying is that those choices, either sticking your head in the sand or beating up on the poor, are not the choices the British people want. They want balance. They want balance between a strong economy and a fairer society, and that is what we are offering.’

Asked why the Lib Dems remained in government with a party they despised, he replied: ‘We have restrained the Conservatives from doing what they want on penalising the poor, on ignoring the environment, on trashing our civil liberties and human rights.’

The Lib Dem conference in Glasgow – the last before the election – comes against the backdrop of dismal poll ratings that has seen its support fall to just 6 per cent.

Mr Clegg yesterday appeared to concede that the Lib Dems were ceasing to be a national party, saying: ‘I accept that, we’re not fighting as forcefully in some parts of the country as others.’

Senior Lib Dems are also furious that last week the Tories copied their plan to raise the starting threshold for income tax to £12,500 if they win the next election. They will try to wrest back the initiative later this week by announcing they will go further by raising the threshold for National Insurance.
