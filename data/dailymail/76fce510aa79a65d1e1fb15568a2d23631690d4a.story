Tragic: Lucia Rodrigo, 16, was found dead along with her horse after it suffered a heart attack, breaking its neck and died on the spot

The family, friends and classmates of a South Florida teenager who was found dead along with a horse she was riding, took part in a memorial ride this weekend. 

100 riders from South Florida's equestrian community saddled up for a two-mile ride on Sunday morning to celebrate the life of 16-year-old Maria Lucia Rodrigo. 

The teenage rider was a student at Cypress Bay High School.

Police found the bodies of Rodrigo and the horse she was riding just after 4 p.m. on Thursday last week.

'She was always there helping us,' said classmate Ana Sofia to WSVN, 'and it's really sad to know that this happened, because you really don't know what can happen next.'

'She was a good girl,' said another classmate. 'She didn't deserve this, neither did the family.' 

Wendy Morell, the horses owner, said that a necropsy performed at the University of Florida's College of Veterinary Medicine in Gainesville confirmed the horse suffered a heart attack and then a broken neck as a result of a fall.

According to the owners of Brownie, the 18-year-old male quarter horse, Rodrigo rode him many times prior to the incident.  

'She rode the horse quite a bit. The horse was very well broke. He done a lot of parades. His heart could've gave out and he just dropped quick. I heard it was quick,' said Terry Sheer, a family friend.

Mystery: Witnesses said they saw Rodrigo riding her horse, Brownie, at full speed along the canal shortly before they were found dead. It still isn't known how they died for certain

Rodrigo went for a short ride but did not return. 'She was just supposed to go around the block and come right back,' Sheer said. 'We all were going to Santa's Enchanted Forest, and we don't know why she went over to Griffin and ran the horse. We have no idea. We didn't even believe that was her, because she was supposed to be right back.' 

A woman who helped teach Lucia how to ride said she believes the horse may have suffered an aneurysm and died on the spot, throwing Lucia off.

'This is a tragedy, a sad thing,' said Elsy Altuve, a rider who came from her home in Miami to attend the event. 'No matter how long you have had horses, how well you ride, there is always an inherent risk,' she told the Sun Sentinel.  

The memorial ride was organized via Facebook by Alexis DeVarona, 19, a Davie resident who attends Broward College. She said she did not know Rodrigo, but was moved by the tragedy.

'We in the horse community need to come together more,' she said. 'And safety is so important.'

Coming together: Friends say Lucia was an experienced rider who had been riding Brownie for several years

A friend of Lucia's said that she saw the teenager galloping along one of the riding paths.

'Horses were her favorite thing. It was her favorite hobby, her favorite thing to do,' Danielle De Varona said to NBC 6.

Friends say she was an experienced rider who had been riding Brownie for several years.

'Lucia was a very good rider, she liked to go a little fast like all of us do every now and then, cause the horses like to do it too,' Diana McClure said. 

'You know, we all are out here every weekend and during the week when we can and it's just really surprising, especially for both of them, for the horse and the rider to go down at the same time,' said Tina Valenchis. 

'It's very unfortunate but we all have to tell ourselves she is in a better place now and she has wings now and she can fly like the angel that she is,' said McClure.

Sadness: In their honor, dozens of riders organized a trail ride from Robbins Lodge to Tree Tops Park in Davie

Thinking of the family: Investigators are trying to gather details as to how they died

The medical examiner is attempting to determine the exact cause of death but it may be several weeks before anything definitive is known. 

The results of an autopsy on Rodrigo have not been made public. But police and many riders have speculated that she was fatally injured when Brownie went down. 

'It's a traumatic and tragic occurrence and unfortunately a young adult was killed,' said Southwest Ranches Mayor Jeff Nelson, 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends.'

According to the owners of Brownie, the 18-year-old male quarter horse, Rodrigo rode him many times prior to the incident. Brownie wasn't easily spooked, but the owners believe he could have suffered a heart attack
