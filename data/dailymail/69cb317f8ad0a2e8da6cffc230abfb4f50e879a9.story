Prince William has revealed that he would have liked to have been an astronaut as he helped launch a new business initiative on his second day in Japan.

William's busy second day also saw him meet Japan's Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, as well as take part in a ceremony at the Hodogaya Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery.

His comments on space travel came during a traditional sake bottle breaking ceremony, conducted with the help of astronauts Tim Peak and Kimiya Yui in Roppongi.

'When I was younger, I dreamed of being an astronaut, but I also wanted to be a policeman or a fire-breather,' said the Prince, adding: 'That might have been a bit alternative.' 

But with his mind now firmly on Earthly goings on, not least the imminent arrival of his second child, William confessed that he has since changed his mind.

Asked whether he would still like to go into space, he quipped: 'I don’t think my Eurocopter will make it that far up. It seems like an awfully long way from the ground.' 

William followed that up with a speech, during which he said sorry for not bringing Kate and George, but added: 'I know that she looks forward to visiting Japan in the future.'

The afternoon speech came after a morning spent visiting the Hodogaya Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery in Yokohama - precisely twenty years after his mother visited.

Like mother, like son: William was visiting exactly 20 years after his mother Princess Diana 

Once inside the cemetery, William, who was wearing his Golden and Diamond Jubilee medals, laid a wreath at the end of a two minutes silence and after the Last Post had been sounded by a bugler.

The floral tribute of chrysanthemums included a note written and signed by the Duke, which said: 'May we never forget all those who paid the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.'

More than 1,500 soldiers, sailors and airmen, many of them British prisoners of war, are buried at the tranquil cemetery, which is a short drive from central Tokyo.

Their plots are marked by simple name plates and grouped by nations including sites for Australian, Indian, New Zealand and Canadian forces.

After Singapore fell in 1942, prisoners were transferred to a camp in Ofuna, near Yokohama, and sent to work in mines, factories and dockyards.

When Allied forces began bombing Japan as the war drew to an end, many prisoners were killed during naval bombardments and air raids.

Speaking after the Duke had laid his wreath, Captain Charles Ashcroft, the UK's defence attaché in Japan, gave a short speech.

'First we must remember the terrible losses that all our countries have suffered and pay tribute to those that have paid the ultimate sacrifice,' he said.

'We are here to pay our respects to the fallen and the wounded in all the conflicts across the world.

'We are now living in very different times, the Commonwealth and Allies stand side by side with Japan in remembrance. 

'Today together we can pay tribute to the Japanese troops currently serving in peace keeping operations with the United Nations and in counter piracy operations with the multi-national coalition.'

After the ceremony, the Duke walked among the graves with Capt Ashcroft, as well as the US defence attaché Captain James O'Leary and Major Isamu Suzuki, representing Japan.

Then came another personally poignant moment, with William asked to sign a visitors' book placed beside a framed photo of his mother.

Japan boasts the oldest continual hereditary monarchy in the world, beginning with Emperor Jimmu who reigned from 660 BC.

Since then, 125 emperors have come and gone, with the most recent, Hirohito, famous for being head of state during the Second World War.

Unlike other members of the Japanese administration, he was not charged with war crimes and instead oversaw Japan's rebirth as a constitutional monarchy - a process continued by his son, Akihito.

The picture, which showed Princess Diana laying a wreath at the same cemetery in 1995, was captioned: 'May she rest in peace'.

Diana's 1995 visit to Japan had sparked chaotic scenes, with the country succumbing en-masse to her charms, sparking what commentators later described as 'Diana fever'.

Her son, who is adored in Japan in part because of his mother, found himself at the centre of similarly sized crowds yesterday.

Explaining the Duke's appeal, one well-wisher, Akane Ebihara, said: 'He is cool and handsome. And very tall!'

That height became even more apparent during his meeting with the diminutive Emperor Akihito today, with 6ft 2" William courteously inclining his head as he was introduced to the Japanese head of state.

With the Emperor at the Gosho, the Japanese Imperial residence, was Empress Michiko and Crown Prince Naruhito. 

The Duke, who referred to Emperor Akhito as 'Your Majesty', recalled their last meeting in 2012, saying: 'Your Majesty, it's very nice to see you again. Thank you for having me here - fantastic.'

William, who also enjoyed a warm welcome from Crown Prince Naruhito, was also introduced to Crown Princess Masako, who is rarely seen in public. 

His busy second day ended with a reception at the British Embassy in Tokyo, where, along with dignitaries, he was introduced to a Mongolian-born sumo wrestler named Yokozuna Harumafuji.
