A NASCAR driver who competed in the night race that killed that 20-year-old Kevin Ward JR has said the young star could clearly be seen on the track before Tony Stewart ran him over.

Dirt track racer Paul Kinney said while he didn't witness the shocking crash in New York on Saturday, he drove past Ward moments before he was hit by Stewart.

After spinning out of the race from a collision with Stewart, an angered Ward got out of his car and walked onto the track, pointing at Stewart, when Stewart smashed into him.

'I drove right by him,' Kinney told NBC News on Monday.

'It’s not a good idea to get out of your car and run towards other cars. 

'But nobody can speak for Tony. Only Tony knows exactly what happened.

'I seen Kevin clear as day. Nobody else ran into him, either.'

The Ontario County sheriff, Philip Povero, said Sunday that there was no evidence of criminal intent on Stewart’s part.

However the incident is still under investigation and could take weeks to conclude.

According to Mashable, Stewart was slated for a sprint-car race in Plymouth, Indiana, on Saturday, but race officials there said Monday that he had withdrawn.

It comes after Stewart broke his silence about the fatal collision at the Empire Super Sprints in Canandaigua, New York.

'There aren't words to describe the sadness I feel about the accident that took the life of Kevin Ward Jr. It's a very emotional time for all involved, and it is the reason I've decided not to participate in today's race at Watkins Glen. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends and everyone affected by this tragedy,' Stewart said in a statement released by spokesman Mike Arning.

The competition director of Stewart's racing team said earlier in the day that he planned to continue Sunday's race, but he was later replaced by fellow driver Regan Smith.

A video purporting to be of the incident was posted on YouTube early Sunday and appeared to show Stewart spinning Ward Jr's car. 

Talent: Kevin Ward Jr was just 20 years old and was a promising racing driver on the US circuit 

The race was then put in 'caution' mode, with a yellow flag that warns the drivers to slow down.

A
 driver, believed to be Ward, is seen exiting his crashed vehicle and 
gesticulating at the other racers as they pass him. The racer then steps
 into the oncoming traffic before he is suddenly struck and thrown into 
the air.

In the next scene emergency workers are seen rushing to his aid. Ward Jr was apparently not struck at racing speed, but sprint cars can go as fast at 140 mph.

The
 track canceled the remainder of the Empire Super Sprints slate within 
five minutes while the Ontario County Sheriff's Department says its 
officers are at the track investigating but do not see it as a criminal 
matter.

Ontario County Sheriff Philip Povero said Stewart was 'visibly shaken' and had been cooperative in the investigation. Authorities were asking spectators and others to turn over any video they recorded of the crash.

'This is right now being investigated as an on-track crash and I don't want to infer that there are criminal charges pending,' Povero said. 'When the investigation is completed, we will sit down with the district attorney and review it. But I want to make it very clear: there are no criminal charges pending at this time.'

Sheriff Philip Povero said Stewart, 42, was 'fully cooperative' and had been questioned and released.

Witnesses at the track also described the collision.

According to onlookers Ward was spun out of the race by Stewart and was hit by the three-time Nascar champion as he passed the spot on his next lap.

'It happened in Turn 2,' Adam Dulski told USA Today.

'The prior lap, Tony had gotten into him – just spun him, nothing big, just spun him around. The caution came out. He hopped out of the car – the driver of the 13 [Kevin Ward] ... he hopped out to go and yell and point a finger at Tony, typical thing.'

'Tony came around ... the back end slid out, and he definitely caught him – I couldn't tell if it was with the front or the back of the car. ... The body made contact with the car and went sliding across the track a long distance, at least 50 feet. It was the worst thing I've ever seen.'

A spokesman for Stewart's racing team called Ward's death a 'tragic accident.'
