They may not look it, but these twins are a real pair of fighters - having survived months of chemotherapy while in the womb.

Their mother Sarah Pierce was 16 weeks pregnant when doctors broke the terrible news that she had breast cancer.

The only chance of saving her life was aggressive chemotherapy, but she was terrified that the unborn twins would not survive.

Against the odds, however, they did - and were born healthy. Experts say they have never known of a mother having chemotherapy while pregnant with twins before.

So lucky: Cancer survivor Sarah Pierce says Jack and Lily, now 18 months old, are full of life

Not only that, but she also had radiotherapy and a mastectomy. Miss Pierce, 40, a cashier, had been desperate for a family with her partner Adam Sparkey, 27, an assistant retail manager, and the couple had saved up £4,200 for IVF treatment.

She said: 'I'd had an ectopic pregnancy ten years previously and doctors had to remove my fallopian tubes, so IVF was my only chance of becoming pregnant.'

Two weeks after the treatment, she discovered she was pregnant and a fortnight later a scan showed there were two heartbeats.

She said: 'We were absolutely thrilled.' But at 16 weeks pregnant she discovered a lump in her breast while in the shower, and a week later doctors delivered the devastating news that it was breast cancer.

Pregnant: Sarah Pierce underwent chemo, radiotherapy and a mastectomy before the birth

Miss Pierce said: 'It was devastating. I couldn't stop crying. 'I was so worried about the babies. The doctors told me I had to have a mastectomy followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy – all while I was still pregnant.

'All I could think of was how could they possibly survive through all that.' Miss Pierce had a mastectomy the following week, when she was 18 weeks pregnant.

Two weeks later she started chemotherapy, losing all her hair - causing her to wear a wig - and suffering from exhaustion.

'Luckily tests on my lymph nodes showed the cancer hadn't spread, which was such a relief,' she said.

'I was so worried about the chemotherapy damaging the babies, but scans every week showed they had kept on growing. Each week it was such a relief to still see them there.'

Miss Pierce then had a month's course of radiotherapy, which finished when she was 30 weeks pregnant.

Five weeks later, in November 2012, the babies were born by emergency caesarean at Newcross Hospital in Wolverhampton, Lily weighing 5lb 1oz and her twin Jack weighing 4lb 13oz.

Miss Pierce said: 'It was the most amazing moment when I finally held them in my arms after everything that had happened.

'They were two little fighters - to have gone through all that in the womb.'

Straight after the twins' birth their mother had to have another course of chemotherapy, which finished three months later.

'It was a much stronger treatment and I felt so exhausted, but every time I held Lily and Jack in my arms, I knew that I was doing it for them,' she said.

'I was determined to see my babies grow up and if it meant going through this, then I would do it.'

She has just finished a 12-month course of the breast cancer drug Herceptin and doctors have told her the cancer is in remission.

She will have to take another drug, Tamoxifen, for the next five years to stop it returning.

She said: 'I feel so lucky that I'm still here and my babies are both here safe and sound.

'They are 18 months old now and are full of life. I feel like the luckiest mum in the world.'

A spokesman for leading breast cancer charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer said: 'We are not aware of such a case before, where a woman has been pregnant with twins while having treatment.'
