Robin Williams is set to return to television after two divorces left him 'in need of a steady job'

Robin Williams will return to TV after nearly three decades – because two divorces have left him short of cash.

The comic’s breakups cost him £20million and he claims to need a ‘steady job’. He is also selling his £20million California ranch due to his sizeable alimony payments.

Williams, who has not been on TV since 1980s series Mork & Mindy, is set to play an unorthodox adman in new CBS show The Crazy Ones.

The 62-year-old, said: ‘Divorce is expensive. I used to joke they were going to call it “all the money”, but they changed it to “alimony”.

It’s ripping your heart out through your wallet.’

His marriage to Valerie Velardi ended in 1988 after the pair had been together for 10 years. The actor then wed his son’s nanny Marsha Garces with whom he stayed for 19 years and had two children with.

The couple divorced in 2008. Williams is now married to graphic designer, Susan Schneider.

In the interview the actor also opens up about his long battle with alcohol and drugs.

Williams said that he was confronted with two other choices apart from doing TV: go on the road doing stand-up or do small independent films for very low pay.

He said: ‘The movies are good, but a lot of times they don’t even have distribution. There are bills to pay. My life has downsized, in a good way. I’m selling the ranch up in Napa.

‘I just can’t afford it anymore.’

He relapsed once after a 20-year-break after he saw a bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey and a voice inside him said: ‘Hey. Just a taste. Just One’.

Williams said: ‘I drank it, and there was that brief moment of: ‘Oh, I’m okay!’ 

‘But it escalated so quickly. Within a week I was buying so many bottles I sounded like a wind chime walking down the street.

‘I knew it was really bad one Thanksgiving when I was so drunk they had to take me upstairs.’ 

Williams will play an unorthodox adman in CBS’s The Crazy Ones costarring Sarah Michelle Gellar as his daughter and ad agency partner.

'We needed an actor who could convey genius, insanity, and comedy, tempered with humanity,' says series creator David E. Kelley.

'Robin was the first and only choice.'
