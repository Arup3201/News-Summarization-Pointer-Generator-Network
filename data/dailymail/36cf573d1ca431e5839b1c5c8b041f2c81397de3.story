The American couple who were rescued at sea earlier this year in order to get medical attention for their sick baby, have come forward to address critics who have called them bad parents. 

Eric and Charlotte Kaufman were on a sailing trip from Mexico to New Zealand last April with their two young daughters when their 1-year-old Lyra got sick.  

When Lyra's condition deteriorated, and their satellite phone failed, the couple was forced to activate their boat's emergency beacon, triggering an expensive Coast Guard rescue.

Many have criticized the Kaufmans for bringing such young children along on a long sailing trip, but now the couple are speaking up, saying they did everything right and it was the satellite phone company that is to blame.

We're good parents: Charlotte and Eric Kaufman have defended their decision to bring their young daughters on a sailing trip earlier this year. The family had to be rescued in April when 1-year-old daughter Lyra needed medical attention

'We’re both experienced sailors,' Mrs Kaufman told ABC News. 'We’ve raised our daughters on a sailboat.'

'We were very prepared,' she added. 'We knew what we were doing.'

The couple say they now plan to sue the satellite cellphone company - Whenever Communications, LLC - for abruptly deactivating their phone while they were 1,000 miles from shore.

While the phone worked when the initially called a doctor about Lyra's condition, service stopped after the Kaufmans communicated with the Coast Guard and expected to receive a call back.

Not our fault: The Kaufmans are blaming their satellite cellphone company for deactivating their phone. If it had been working, they say they wouldn't have needed to turn on their emergency beacon, triggering an expensive Coast Guard rescue

Homeless: The 36-foot sailboat named the Rebel Heart had to be sunk after their rescue. It was their home for the previous eight years

They tried turning the phone off and on but couldn't get through.

Eventually they made the decision to activate their emergency beacon so that Lyra could get the medical attention she needed.

The cellphone company has since issued a statement saying there was a billing problem with the Kaufman's account.

'I think the evidence clearly represents that they did what they did and that was the action that ultimately started a chain of events,' Eric Kaufman told 10 News.

The couple and daughters Lyra and Cora, 3, were rescued from their 36-foot sailboat named the Rebel Heart 12 hours after activating the beacon.

The Rebel Heart was the Kaufman's home for the previous eight years and had to be sunk once they abandoned it.

The family was taken to the USS Vandegrift where little Lyra was treated with more antibiotics. Doctors believe she may have had typhoid of salmonella.

The Kaufmans plan to file a civil suit against Whenever Communications later this week, asking for compensation for the loss of their sailboat and money to cover the cost of the expensive military rescue paid by taxpayers.

If they win the case, they plan to buy a new sailboat and continue their around-the-world adventures.

'I can't wait to get back,' said Charlotte. 'It's an amazing lifestyle.'
