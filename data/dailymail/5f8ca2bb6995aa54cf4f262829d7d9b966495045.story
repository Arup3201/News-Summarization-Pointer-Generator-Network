Pope Francis was back to work this morning after canceling a planned visit to a hospital to say Mass due to an 'unexpected disposition'.

The 77-year-old Pontiff received the president of Madagascar during a ten-minute audience in the Vatican.

Witnesses said the Holy Father looked tired but smiled frequently during the meeting.

He later delivered a speech to a visiting delegation from the Orthodox church without any problems, before two further meetings with Vatican cardinals.

The
 pontiff was due to visit one of Rome's major hospitals yesterday but 
was forced to cancel the engagement at the last moment.

The
 Vatican issued a statement almost an hour after he was due to arrive at
 the Gemelli Hospital to celebrate Mass that he was unable to attend.

However, Vatican spokesman Rev Federico Lombardi said the 77-year-old Argentinian was able to continue with his diary for the weekend and that there were 'no concerns for his health'.

The Pope said Mass as normal on Friday morning but felt tired after a grueling couple of weeks and was unable to complete his planned visit.

People had already gathered at the 
hospital to await the pope when the Vatican issued a statement saying 
Angelo Scola, Cardinal of Milan, would read the homily in his place.

The crowd applauded when Scola sent his best wishes to the pope, leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics.

'I
 am sure I act for the hearts and minds of us all when I send a warm 
embrace to Pope Francis. May he overcome this indisposition quickly.'

Pope Francis only has one full lung and also has a back problem which makes walking painful.

Earlier this week, Pope Francis ordered stopped his Ford Focus to bless a young woman on a stretcher

Earlier this month, he was forced to cancel two full days of audiences due to a stomach bug and last week he decided against participating in a mile-long procession in Southern Italy.

However, he was able to complete his weekly audience in St Peter's Square on Wednesday, however these have been suspended for the summer period.

During a 12-hour trip to Calabria in Southern Italy, Pope Francis disembarked his car to bless a sick young man who was carried up to his motorcade on a stretcher.

Pope Francis is expected to say a major Mass tomorrow in St Peter's Square.

In August, he is due to travel to South Korea.

Fr Lombardi said: 'The engagements on the Holy Father's agenda for Saturday June 28 and Sunday June 29 are confirmed,"
