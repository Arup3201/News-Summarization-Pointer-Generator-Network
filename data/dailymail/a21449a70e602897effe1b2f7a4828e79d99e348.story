Labour got it wrong: Ed Miliband admits today that his party became disconnected from the concerns of working people about immigration during their 13 years in power

Ed Miliband today promised new measures to prevent British people being 'locked out' of jobs by foreign workers, including forcing firms to declare if they employ high numbers of immigrants.

Overseas-only employment agencies would be banned and an early-warning system set up to highlight areas where locals are 'dominated' by an influx of overseas labour under the proposals.

While there cannot be set quotas on home-grown workers, urgent action is required to identify where British jobseekers need better training to compete, the Labour leader said.

In a major U-turn, Mr Miliband said the party became 'disconnected from the concerns 
of working people' during its 13 years in power.

Labour often tried to silence criticism of its immigration policy by suggesting it was inspired by racism while in office.

The announcement represents a 
major change of direction for the party after Gordon Brown branded voter 
Gillian Duffy a 'bigoted woman' for raising concerns about the impact of immigration during the 2010 election campaign.

Mr Brown was forced to apologise to Mrs Duffy, 65, after he met her to smooth over her anger after insulting her.

It was one of the key moments in the election campaign and was see to signify how out of touch Labour had become on immigration.

As
he got into his car, Brown was still wired to a Sky News microphone and
was overheard telling an aide: 'That was a disaster.. They should never
have put me with that woman. Whose idea was that? Ridiculous.'

Asked what was wrong, Brown responded: 'Everything, she was just a bigoted woman.'

Mr Miliband said Labour made a mistake by allowing
uncontrolled migration into Britain in 2004 when Poland and other 
eastern European states joined the EU.

He said demanding that job centres be
told of all firms where more than one in four staff is from overseas 
would form part of the new system to provide Whitehall and town halls 
with vital information.

Mr Miliband hopes to shift the focus 
of the debate from border controls, and what he says are ineffective 
Government caps on arrivals, towards the impact on people’s daily lives.

While restrictions on new arrivals, 
including caps on people from any new EU member state, are necessary, 
reforming the jobs market is just as important, he argued.

Stricter enforcement of minimum wage 
laws and doubling fines to £10,000 would also form part of an effort to 
stop firms using cheap foreign labour to undercut domestic jobseekers.

Flashpoint: Gordon Brown was caught calling Gillian Duffy (right) a 'bigoted woman' after she raised the issue of migrant workers with him on the campaign trail

Mr Miliband distanced himself from 
the rhetoric of his predecessor Gordon Brown, saying: 'I am not going to
promise "British jobs for British workers".

'But we need an economy which offers 
working people a fair crack of the whip. The problem we need to address 
is in those areas and sectors where local talent is locked out of 
opportunity.'

He said Labour had to change its approach to immigration and recognise 'the costs as well as the benefits'.

The last Labour government under Mr Brown became 'too disconnected from the concerns of working people', he said.

'We too easily assumed those who 
worried about immigration were stuck in the past, unrealistic about how 
things could be different, even prejudiced,' he said.

'But Britain was experiencing the largest peacetime migration in recent history, and people’s concerns were genuine.

'Why didn’t we listen more? At least 
by the end of our time in office, we were too dazzled by globalisation 
and too sanguine about its price.

Polish only: Workers after being dropped off at the Bernard Matthew's factory in Great Witchingham, Norfolk

One of Asda's biggest meat suppliers caused controversy when it was caught advertising for Polish-speaking staff only.

Forza AW sent the advert to hundreds of job hunters on the books of a Norfolk-based employment agency. One was told: 'You have to be fluent because the health and safety training is done in Polish.'

The ban on British applicants, which is illegal under the Race Relations Act, happened in 2010. Forza chief executive Max Hilliard said at the time the advert went out as a result of a 'breakdown in communications'.

Job hunters in the area yesterday complained they often lose out to foreigners.

Sarah Davies, 32, from Norwich, who lost her cleaning job four months ago, said: 'There are a lot of foreign workers and you are competing against them for even the most basic jobs.

'It means people like me are being left on the scrapheap. I don't want to be a burden on the taxpayer.'

Does Ed Miliband's immigrant family past make him best placed to understand the issue?

'By focusing too much on 
globalisation and migration’s impact on growth, we lost sight of who was
benefiting from that growth - and the people who were being squeezed. 
And, to those who lost out, Labour was too quick to say ‘Like it or lump
it’.'

Mr Miliband said the numbers of low-skilled immigrants coming to the UK 'are probably still too high and I would like to do something about it'.

But many of those arrivals were from the EU and so the answer had to lie in reducing the demand for cheap labour rather than any 'blanket promise about numbers'.

That problem, he added, was being worsened by the Government's proposals - on the back of the Beecroft review - to relax employment laws.

'Of course overall numbers matter but it does also depend on who is coming in and what impact they are having,' he said when he took questions after the speech.

'On the question of low-skilled migration, I think numbers are probably still too high and I would like to do something about it.

'But most of that is from within the EU - because we have tightened up the other routes - and therefore the question on this is how to you change the way your economy works so that employers do not resort to that as their response.'

A Tory spokesman said Labour continued to lack 'credibility' on immigration.

Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the 
MigrationWatch think-tank, last night welcomed the change of heart, but 
said it needed to be followed by a change of strategy.

He said: 'Mumbled apologies are not 
enough. Having caused the mass immigration of recent years, will Labour 
now pledge to cut back future immigration, and if so how?'

Mr Miliband suggested that Labour under Tony Blair became 'dazzled by globalisation and too sanguine about its price'.

He said the impact of immigration has
had a class divide, with the well-off benefiting from cheap labour, 
while others find their own jobs and incomes are undercut.

The Labour leader will also outline a string of changes to the party's approach to immigration.

He will acknowledge the party made 'a mistake' in not putting controls on the number of migrants who flocked here from Poland and other Eastern European countries after they joined the EU. Countries joining in future, such as Croatia and Turkey, should face curbs.
