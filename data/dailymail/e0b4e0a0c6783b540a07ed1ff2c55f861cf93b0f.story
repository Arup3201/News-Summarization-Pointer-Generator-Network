Customers who are owed £153million by rip-off energy firms could get their money back under a scheme unveiled by the industry today.

The huge sum has built up over the last six years after the energy giants held on to money paid by customers who then switched to a cheaper rival supplier.

These are customers who effectively overpaid on their gas and electricity monthly direct debits and were in credit when they decided to move to a new energy firm.

Ofgem, the industry has drawn up a scheme that will go some way to repaying customers who are out of pocket

The money became a windfall for the energy firms, who have been accused of deliberately dragging their feet on making efforts to make sure departing customers got their money back.

Now, following pressure from the industry regulator, Ofgem, the industry has drawn up a scheme that will go some way to repaying customers who are out of pocket.

In February, Ofgem called on suppliers to give customers their money back, use balances that cannot be returned to individuals in a way that would benefit consumers more widely and make sure there is no repeat of the scandal.

Ofgem’s chief executive, Dermot Nolan, said repaying the money is the very least that the energy companies should do.

‘Today’s industry announcement is an encouraging first step by the six largest energy companies to address Ofgem’s call to reunite customers with their cash,’ he said.

‘This issue is part of a wider challenge of delivering good customer service that the industry must crack if they are to rebuild customer trust and confidence.

‘And while Ofgem welcomes the progress made to date, suppliers must now do everything within their powers to return the money and prevent a similar situation from happening again. Failure to deliver on the initiatives announced today could trigger further action by Ofgem, including enforcement.’

He urged the public to contact their former energy suppliers to establish whether they are owed money.

Amber Rudd MP, the Minister of Energy and Climate Change said: ‘People should rightly be returned money that is theirs and was left behind when they moved house or switched.

‘Earlier this year, the Government and Ofgem announced plans to get to the bottom of problems with outstanding credit balances and an agreement was reached with the major energy companies to ensure they automatically refund direct debits to customers who are in credit.’

Energy UK, the industry trade body, has set up the website myenergycredit.com to help families track down money they are owed by its members.

The group’s chief executive is Angela Knight, who previously ran the British Bankers Association, whose members have been found guilty of routinely ripping off their customers on everything from payment protection insurance to mortgages.

She described the energy industry’s efforts to ensure customers get their money back as a ‘great campaign’.

Miss Knight said: ‘This money has been left behind and we are urging former customers to come forward and make a claim.

‘Customers who think they haven’t left a forwarding address or a final meter reading when they moved or switched should contact their old supplier. The web site www.myenergycredit.com will help you do this.

‘Inevitably, there will be some former customers who will not be found and so the major suppliers are announcing what will happen to credit balances from now on.

‘In future, after two years, the credit balance will be used to help vulnerable customers - and suppliers will make it very clear what is happening. By 2018, these new arrangements are expected to add up to around £65 million of help to those in difficulties. The suppliers will kick start this process now by donating £38 million for the first two years combined.’

Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other.

Shrewd

 consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - reviewing 
deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest 
deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts.

If
 you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. 
stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big 
chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year.

Remember, suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so.

Don't forget, prices
 are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you 
will depend where you live.

You only need to be interested in the tariff
 that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison 
to find the best price.
