That blue Burberry suit worn by Nine morning presenter Karl Stefanovic for a whole year, to prove a point over sexism, has now been sold.

The Today show host has handed over the famous threads to the lucky highest bidder on Ebay, Hamilton Island Weddings' managing director Rohan Gull purchasing it for $6400.

But because all the proceeds are going to a worthy cause, the White Ribbon campaign to end violence against women, he pitched in a little bit more to take the bid to $10,000.

All proceeds from its sale go to the White Ribbon Australia charity, a campaign to end violence against women 

Ex seven weather presenter Grant Denyer, who got married by Hamilton Island Wedding's says he has plans to maybe wear the suit when he renews his vows

'We were inspired by Karl for wearing the suit for a whole year and were shocked when reading into the statistics, so that made us want to make a donation,' said Mr Gull.

Stefanovic wore the Burberry blue suit every day for a whole year, just changed his shirt and tie, and made the internet go 'a little bit crazy' all to make aware the double standards women face, especially in the television industry.

Ex seven weather presenter Grant Denyer, who got married by Hamilton Island Wedding's says he has plans to maybe wear the suit when he renews his vows.

On twitter he wrote, 'I was married by Rohan&AMAZING @HIWeddings team! I'm renewing vows now just 2 hire THE @karlstefanovic suit!'

The little bit 'stanky' suit was auctioned off on Ebay with a starting bid of $1000, and was described as super comfy, stylish and cool, but it may need to be dry cleaned. 

He is a big advocate for the White Ribbon campaign and believes it's something everyone should be aware of.

'This issue needs to be addressed from the highest levels of society in terms of the law and the way our perpetrators are sentenced,' he told Fairfax Media.

'Hamilton Island Weddings saw a chance to buy Karl's suit as a great way for the jacket and pants to live on and continue to raise money for White Ribbon,' said Mr Gull.

After revealing that he wore his Burberry suit every year for a day the Today show presenter decided to put it up on auction on Ebay to raise money for Charity White Ribbon Australia and it sold for $6400 to Hamilton Island Weddings, who then bumped it up to $10,000

They are now making a call out to all future Hamilton Island grooms, groomsmen and wedding guests to make a donation which gets them the privilege of wearing the suit at their wedding.

'We're guna have to get the exact size to give to people, have it measured,' he said.

As for whether they are going to dry clean it before they let anyone wear it?

'We might leave it up to the first person that wears it,' he said.

As for the rules of wearing the suit and how much people have to donate to be able to don the blue jacket and pants, it's wide open.

'Leaving it open to rules of wearing the suit, keen to see what people will donate, hopefully decent bids.'

'I think will get a lot of people, even wedding guests who would be willing to wear a good novelty suit, I've inspected it and it’s a nice suit.' 

Stefanovic's experiment sparked worldwide media interest from websites like the BBC and New York Post 

Mr Gull said they only starting bidding towards the end of the auction and the price jumped significantly but they were able to end up winners after quite a few bids.

He'll be flying back to Hamilton island on Thursday and says he plans to document the suits travels on social media.

As for whether there's plans of maybe a shrine, to showcase the suit, possibly!

'Might have to put it in a safe,' he said. 

After Stefanovic revealed his everyday workwear, he said he had not received one complaint about his repetitive attire over the past year, but his female co-host Lisa Wilkinson regularly copped criticism about the way she looked.

He said no one had even noticed his choice of attire while women got the brunt of everything from the colour they wore to thousands of tweets about something wrong they said.

'I'm judged on my interviews, my appalling sense of humour – on how I do my job, basically. Whereas women are quite often judged on what they're wearing or how their hair is ... that's (what I wanted to test),' Stefanovic told Fairfax Media. 

Stefanovic's  experiment also sparked a media frenzy worldwide with interest coming from websites like the BBC and New York Post.

Feminist website Jezabel were among those to weigh in on the experiment.
