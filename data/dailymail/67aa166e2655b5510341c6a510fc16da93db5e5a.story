For most women it is a problem they hope to leave behind in their teenage years.

But recent studies have revealed that more and more are suffering with embarrassing spots and pimples in adult life.

Now a skin care treatment favoured by American celebrities, which claims to banish blemishes in days, is set to revolutionise the lives of acne sufferers when it is launched in Britain this week.

The Proactiv range promises to leave skin looking healthier in just 14 days

The three 120ml bottles of Proactiv cleanser, toner and repair lotion claim to clear away spots and leave skin looking healthier in just 14 days.

Formulated by two US female dermatologists, the solution contains salicylic acid, a natural plant extract which helps clear blocked pores by eliminating dead skin cells.

It has more than 15 million customers in 60 countries and counts stars Katy Perry, Elle Macpherson, Justin Bieber, Alicia Keys and Avril Lavigne among its celebrity clients.

Previously available on American websites only, the £39.99 treatment is expected to be a sell out when it goes on sale on the British High Street at Boots for the first time on February 15.

Recent surveys have revealed that more than half of UK women over 30 struggle with spots or blemishes, while as many as 14 per cent are diagnosed with acne.

Experts have found that the average age of those being treated for adult acne is also on the up. While in 1984 the average age of an acne sufferer was around 20, today they are more likely to be nearer 30.

Acne occurs when the sex hormones - particularly the male hormone testosterone - become overactive and produce excess oil.

These hormones are particularly rife during the teenage years, but a surge also occurs during pregnancy, IVF treatment and the menopause. Stress is also believed to be a trigger.

Dr Kathy Fields, a dermatologist who co-created Proactiv, said: ‘We started noticing that is wasn’t just teenagers, but everybody - men and women in their 20’s, 30’s, 40’s and above - who suddenly started breaking out (with spots) for the very first time, due to hormonal changes, menopausal changes, stress and all kinds of factors in their lives.

‘Most of the blemish treatments you buy at the chemist are 'spot treatments', designed primarily to get rid of existing pimples and can be harsh and drying on the skin.  

‘The Proactiv system is a combination system that’s gentle enough for different skin types and needs. As well as calming existing pimples and blackheads, it deals with breakouts before they start.’

More than 1,000 UK women tested Proactiv as part of an eight week clinical trial last year.

Users apply the three stage solution – cleanser, toner and repair lotion – twice daily, morning and night.

A staggering 88 per cent said they had less spots and 86 per cent said they had a clearer complexion – some in less than two weeks.

Jackie Smith, 46, of Maidstone, Kent, began using Proactiv as part of a trial after she started getting spots because of the menopause.

‘I’ve had menopausal symptoms for over two years including hot flushes, sleep disturbance and blemishes,’ she said.

‘Whilst I put up with the flushes and insomnia I found the blemishes really embarrassing. Nothing seemed to work and everything I tried made my skin very sensitive. 

‘A friend suggested I try Proactiv, the results were amazing. After two weeks I had a clear, brighter complexion and by using it every day I’ve not  had any more bad breakouts.’

Singer Katy Perry said she had tried everything to get rid of her acne before turning to Proactiv.

‘Blemishes really made me want to hide,’ she said. ‘I’d wear makeup to bed or stay in if I had a bad breakout. Since I started using Proactiv I’ve seen a massive change in my face and my confidence. I really believe in it.’
