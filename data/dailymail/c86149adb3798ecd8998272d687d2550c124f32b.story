 

They never imagined they would be living such a nightmare, but now the family and friends of American hostage Steven Sotloff say they are praying that his life will be spared by ISIS terrorists holding him captive.

Chilling footage of the Miami-based freelance journalist was released on Tuesday as Muslim extremists warned President Obama that there would be another execution if the US continued with its bomb attacks on Iraq. Graphic images were released at the same time of the beheading of American photojournalist James Foley.

Sotloff, 31, was paraded in front of the camera and held by the collar of his shirt as a masked operative warned: 'The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.'

Mystery: Steven Sotloff's parents hadn't heard from him since four months after he went missing a year ago

Horror: In another chilling warning, the executioner holds Steven Sotloff on his knees with his hands tied behind his back, by the scruff of the neck

Sotloff has been missing since August 2013, when he was kidnapped near Aleppo, Syria.

The video yesterday was the first his parents, Arthur and Shirley, heard about Steve since December, according to the hostage's long-time friend Emerson Lotzia.

ISIS terrorists holding the journalist had allowed him to contact his parents, although the details of their communication are unknown.

'They had no idea if he was dead or alive until they saw that footage. It was a mixed bag of emotions for his family.

'On one hand they knew he was alive. But now they can see what he's going through. It's every parent's worst nightmare.

Lotzia revealed that he had spoken to Steven's father after the video's release, and he admitted he felt better before the tape was released than afterwards.

Speaking to MailOnline, Lotzia, who is a TV sports anchor for West Palm Beach station WPTV, says he is horrified by what's happened to his former college roommate.

The pair had shared a dorm together at the University of Central Florida, near Orlando, then an apartment together for two more years. Sotloff, who had been studying print journalism, decided to leave after his junior year and return to Miami.

Top journalist: Sotloff's work had been published in TIME, World Affairs, and the Christian Science Monitor. The last story he filed was on November 26, 2012, titled Libya's New Crisis

Sotloff said he wanted to wanted to explore the Middle East. And within a few months was making the first of his many visits to that part of the world.

'He would spend long periods over there and pop back home to see his family for a month or so,' says Lotzia, who last spoke to his buddy in February 2013.

'We all thought he was crazy but he loved it over there. He didn't seem to be in fear that anything bad could happen to him. He became fluent in Arabic and mixed with all the locals.

'He enjoyed reporting on what was going in in the Middle East. He always talked about wanting to travel and tell the story of what was going on. It's difficult to believe he's being held hostage by this scumbag group.

Sotloff's work had been published in TIME, World Affairs, and the Christian Science Monitor. The last story he filed was on November 26, 2012, titled Libya's New Crisis.

'He's a great guy and can get on with anyone,' continued Lotzia. 'He's funny and laid back and very smart - both book smart and street smart.

Fear: Soltoff has been missing since August 2013, when he disappeared while reporting near Aleppo

'I know he had a lot of friends over there, but he never mentioned a girlfriend

'He wandered around without a care in the world and I don't think he made any attempt to hide who was and what he was doing there. With hindsight that might have made him an easy target. 

'I couldn't believe it when I heard he'd been taken hostage. It didn't seem real.

'And even then we didn't imagine he'd be in any real danger because he's just a regular guy with no agenda and he genuinely loved the people over there. I can't imagine what he's going through and I feel so bad for his family. 

'They were thinking positive until yesterday. If anybody can bond with their captors it's Steve, but who knows what kind of people he's dealing with?

'He's not the kind of guy to pick fights. He'll just do what they say. I'm sure he'll have tried to get on with them as best you can with someone holding you hostage.'

Lotzia noted how his buddy had lost weight and had his head shaved in the video. 

'I can't bring myself to watch the whole thing... that poor guy getting beheaded.' He added: 'We had a lot of great times together and I hope we can many more. Whenever he was home in Florida he would call me and we would meet for a few drinks.

'He's a quiet guy, not a party animal at all. And when he was away we'd stay in touch on Facebook. 

'Steve's a fantastic human being, a fun guy. He loves sport, especially Miami Heat. I had some of the best years of my life with him at UCF. He liked to socialize and there were girls, but never anyone serious.

Family crisis: This morning the boyfriend of Steven's sister Lauren,  Frank Castle (left) released a Facebook post urging people to sign a White House petition calling on the US government to 'do everything possible to free American reporter Steven Sotloff from ISIS in Syria and save his life.' Steven's dad Arthur (right) admitted he felt better before the release of the tape

'We had long nights laughing... and heart-to-hearts when we'd cry together. Our first ever Spring Break we stayed at his parents' house and I met his sister, Lauren, which I why I feel so close to his family.

'I'm just praying he's going to be okay... we all are.'

Steven sent out his last tweet on August 3, talking about the Heat.

According to his account, he was living in Benghazi, Libya, at the time. He had previously lived in Yemen for several years.
