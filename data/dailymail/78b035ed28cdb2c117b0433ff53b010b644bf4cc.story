A platoon of Britain’s top actors, including Michael Gambon, Bill Nighy and Toby Jones, are joining a half-baked scheme to remake Dad’s Army, the best-loved British sitcom in telly history, for international cinema release.

Who do they think they are kidding?

The original comedy, which ran from 1968 to 1977, starred a collection of character actors, bit-part comedians and repertory troupers: when the show launched there wasn’t a household name among them. But as the series gained popularity, every one of them found a place in the nation’s heart.

It wasn’t just the scripts, by David Croft and Jimmy Perry, hilarious though they were. It wasn’t only the sublime comic timing of old hands such as Arthur Lowe and John Le Mesurier, who played the bombastic Home Guard Captain Mainwaring and his wearily aristocratic sergeant, Mr Wilson — the parts now earmarked for Jones and Nighy.

Some have attributed the show’s success to its theme, a nostalgic celebration of the bulldog courage and dauntless incompetence that somehow saw Britain through the darkest hours in a thousand years.

Others point to its command of the catchphrase — there is guaranteed laughter every time Clive Dunn as Corporal Jones squawks ‘Don’t panic!’ or the lugubrious Highlander Private Fraser, played by John Laurie, mutters: ‘We’re doomed ... doomed, I tell ye!’

If a perfect sitcom could be created by formula, these would be its elements. But it isn’t that simple.

Most of the stars of Dad’s Army are long dead. Only Ian Lavender, who was the mollycoddled Private Pike, and Frank Williams, who played the effete vicar, are still with us; the most recent loss was the huff-puffing air raid warden Mr Hodges, played by Bill Pertwee, who died last year aged 86.

It was the extraordinary chemistry between all the cast that made the show a joy. That cannot be emulated, no matter how famous or highly paid the 2014 ensemble might be.

Bombastic: Toby Jones will take on the role of Captain Mainwaring, originally played by Arthur Lowe

In fact, a glance at the names will tell you that this wrong-headed remake by Universal Pictures is certain to fail, because of their very celebrity. Egos will clash; instead of chemistry there will be only friction.

It’s why rock supergroups always produce bombastic rubbish, and national football teams crammed with club superstars usually play like a bunch of sulking divas.

By contrast, the original members of Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard appreciated the irony that all of them had stumbled into fame after decades of obscurity.

The only juvenile among these veterans was Lavender, who is now 68 but was 22 when the sitcom began. It was not expected to run for more than 13 weeks, but the sense of camaraderie was immediate.

Ask Lavender about those days now and he’ll chat for hours, with unquenched affection and tears, often, in his eyes. His closest friend in the cast was Laurie, who had worked with Alfred Hitchcock and acting greats Peggy Ashcroft and Laurence Olivier.

Both Pike and Fraser didn’t have many lines in the first series, so the older man taught the young upstart the most important skill in a jobbing actor’s repertoire — how to do the Times crossword.

The leisure time also gave Lavender an opportunity to see how experienced actors made themselves comfortable on set. 

Le Mesurier, for instance, was an incorrigibly lazy man of irresistible charm — he once persuaded a make-up girl to take the watch off his wrist, wind it and buckle it back on. ‘He couldn’t be bothered to do it himself,’ laughs Lavender.

Legend: Bill Nighy will reprise the role of Wilson, which John Le Mesurier made his own in the original show

Real acting experience creates great performances in ways that cannot be predicted. Arthur Lowe was 53 when he first played Mainwaring, and had 30 years in rep theatre behind him. As a young man he had developed a photographic memory, to cope with the demands of doing a different play every week in the provinces.

‘The trouble was,’ the writer David Croft once recalled, ‘Arthur thought he still had a photographic memory, but he didn’t. This accounted for those sudden hesitations, which seemed like wonderful comic timing but was usually: “What the hell am I going to say next?” ’

Le Mesurier, on the other hand, did have perfect recall and could even remember the page numbers on which his lines appeared. Lowe’s failing memory was one of the few things that really irritated Le Mesurier: ‘Can’t he learn it like the rest of us?’ he would complain.

The hint of petulance in his performance only added to its charm — what Croft called ‘the way he suffers so well’.

Damaged: Bill Paterson has the task of bringing Frazer to life, originally played by John Laurie. The actor suffered traumatic shock during World War I, as a gunner with the Honourable Artillery Company

This ideal cast was not entirely assembled by design. Some arrived by accident: James Beck, for example, another repertory veteran, was not the initial choice to be the rascally spiv Private Walker. Writer Jimmy Perry, who had served in the Home Guard himself and came up with the original concept, wanted that role for himself.

Croft, shrewdly guessing that his co-writer would gain too much power over the scripts if he was also a star, vetoed that idea and suggested Beck instead. It’s a mark of how integral every cast member became that most fans agree the show never recovered from Beck’s early death, from pancreatitis aged 44, in 1973.

But it was casting Jonesie, the town butcher who had fought in the Boer War, that really caused problems. First choice was Jack Haig, a former music hall performer who appeared in the long-running soap Crossroads for 15 years and is now best remembered as Monsieur LeClerc in another Croft comedy, ’Allo ’Allo.

Hero: Arnold Ridley, who was 72 when he first played Godfrey, pictured, was a man who had fought in both world wars and who, like his character, had gone ‘over the top’ on the Somme

Haig was set to take the role until the BBC’s head of light entertainment, Tom Sloan, advised him against it — Dad’s Army was expected to flop.

David Jason, who was then 27 and just beginning to make a name for himself in a sketch show called Do Not Adjust Your Set, also read for the part — but even in heavy make-up, he couldn’t pass for a doddery hero of the siege of Mafeking.

Despite Croft’s misgivings, the part finally went to Clive Dunn, then in his late 40s but used to playing much older characters.

These coincidences and happy chances brought together an ensemble that all the casting agents in Hollywood could not reproduce.

But even that is not the deepest reason why Dad’s Army should never be remade.

Take Sir Michael Gambon — ‘the Great Gambon’, as the legendary actor Ralph Richardson dubbed him. Gambon is to be simpering Private Godfrey, the conscientious objector from World War I who nevertheless won the Military Medal for his courage under fire on the Somme, as a medical orderly.

But though Gambon is a theatre heavyweight, he is not a war veteran. Arnold Ridley, who was 72 when he first played Godfrey, truly was — a man who had fought in both world wars and who, like his character, had gone ‘over the top’ on the Somme. Ridley’s experiences left him with an indelible loathing of war. 

The years he endured in the trenches had shattered his nerves, and for the rest of his life he suffered a recurring nightmare — that the Armistice had never happened, and he was under orders to report back to his regiment to continue fighting.

This dread woke him many times in the night, shouting and sweating. But the worst was still to come: in 1939, after Germany had invaded Poland, Britain was once more at war and Ridley felt obliged to join up, aged 44.

He served in the British Expeditionary Force with the rank of major. ‘Within hours of setting foot on the quay at Cherbourg, I was suffering from acute shell-shock again,’ he wrote. John Laurie also suffered traumatic shock during World War I, as a gunner with the Honourable Artillery Company. He served in the thick of the fighting at Passchendaele in 1917, and though he survived physically unscathed, he later had a nervous breakdown.

When Jimmy Perry screened old newsreel footage from the Western Front during a lull in Dad’s Army rehearsals, he was surprised by the strength of Laurie’s reaction. ‘Turn it off, son,’ pleaded the old soldier. ‘I cannae watch it.’

That heartfelt depth of experience is what imbues Dad’s Army with its universal appeal, and explains why generations of comedy fans cherish it. It was also screened in an age — the late Sixties — when many millions of viewers remembered with fear and loathing what it had been like to feel terror at the prospect of a Nazi invasion.

And they were watching a corps of elderly men who knew what it meant to defend their country. They had fought once and didn’t want to fight again, but nothing could make them shirk their duty.

It’s an emotion that the cast of any Dad’s Army remake will never fully be able to comprehend. However good they are, they’ll just be acting. The original, inimitable stars had lived it.
