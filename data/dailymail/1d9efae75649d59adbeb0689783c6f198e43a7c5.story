Britain's biggest loyalty card scheme has boosted security after it was targeted by fraudsters in an apparent eBay scam. 

Nectar, which is used by more than 19 million people, is the latest card scheme to fall foul of fraudsters after it linked up with the auction website to allow customers to spend points online.

Under the Nectar and eBay scheme, members can collects points on eBay purchases and then change their points into vouchers to spend on the auction site.

But customers have seen thousands of points going missing from their Nectar account - only to find out later they have been spent on eBay. 

The problem is believed to have arisen because customers can link their Nectar cards to more than one eBay account, and vice versa.

That has allowed fraudsters to steal shoppers' points and move it to their own eBay account to spend without the card holder noticing any unusual activity. 

The Swales family, from York, were first alerted that their Nectar account had been compromised when they tried to pay for shopping with their card in December but were told they were unable to.

After checking their account, they found that 9,000 points had disappeared to later be used on eBay - but not by them.

They eventually received a full refund and Nectar is now investigating what happened, after telling the family they were not the only ones who had been hit. 

Nectar has since added extra security measures, and customers are now required to enter a secondary authentication when linking their accounts, Claire Woffenden of Betanews reports. 

Millions of people are members of the Nectar card scheme. Launched in 2002, over half of Britain's households own a card

Customers currently enjoy a number of perks, including double Nectar points on all Sainsbury’s shopping – online and in store – and two Nectar points per £1 spent on Sainsbury's fuel - plus one point per litre when the customer also swipes their Nectar.

Points can also be gained at Homebase, BP and British Gas and redeemed at cinemas, Argos, the Eurostar, Orient Express, Amazon and resorts such as Alton Towers.

While millions of loyalty cards are in use in Britain, a recent poll by YouGov Sixth Sense found that 93 per cent of respondents would carry on shopping even if their loyalty cards were stopped.

Analysts believe the true value of the cards to supermarkets is for the data they give the chains about our spending habits.  

Ania Krwawicz, spokeswoman for Nectar's parent company Aimia, said police were also now investigating.

She said: 'We became aware of suspicious activity on a small number of Nectar accounts. We informed those customers affected, notified the police and are working with them on this investigation'. 

MainOnline has contacted eBay for comment.

Nectar is the latest in a line of loyalty cards to become a victim of account hacking. 

In 2013 Tesco customers claimed they'd fallen victim to online fraudsters who had hacked into their Clubcard accounts and taken hundreds of pounds worth of vouchers. 

At the time, the supermarket giant said it believed fraudsters had stolen people's online IDs and passwords through phishing emails and opportunistically used them on the Clubcard website.  

The supermarket asked police to investigate claims that dozens of its customers' Clubcard accounts may have fallen victim to the online fraud, with some losing vouchers they accumulated over several years.

Nectar card users have also reported that points have been stolen and spent at Argos.
