The Premier League have been urged by one of their own clubs to take the lead on slashing ticket prices for hard-up supporters by encouraging every top-flight team to reduce admission fees.

Swansea vice-chairman Leigh Dineen said he would like to cut huge amounts off all ticket prices for City’s fans, including season tickets, and believes other clubs could do the same due to the £5.5billion of TV riches pouring into the Premier League in the current three-year TV deal ‘cycle’.

But he says if Swansea - a family-friendly club co-owned by fans - go it alone on price reductions, they would put themselves at a competitive disadvantage.

Dineen said: ‘We’d love to substantially decrease ticket prices for all of our fans but we’d be less competitive. It could only happen if all Premier League clubs agreed to the same reductions. The German model with low ticket prices is great and something we could look towards in our league.’

He said the Premier League should have taken a lead on the issue when the TV deal was announced.

‘The Premier League missed a trick on this issue,’ he said. ‘They could have announced that all clubs would be required to make reductions for away fans carte blanche. Instead, it’s been left to the clubs to try to strike reciprocal deals.

'We approached all the clubs last year and got nowhere. Since then we’ve managed to strike reciprocal deals with six or seven clubs including Newcastle, Sunderland, Aston Villa and West Brom, with others coming forward. But if the Premier League had taken the lead, we wouldn’t have had to spend so much time trying to generate interest for the benefit of our fans.’

Kevin Miles, chief executive of the Football Supporters’ Federation suggested Premier League crowds could soon ‘die out’ if ticket prices continued to rise because young fans were being priced out.

This year, supporters will pay an average of £526 for their club’s lowest priced adult season ticket, a rise of 6.5 per cent.
