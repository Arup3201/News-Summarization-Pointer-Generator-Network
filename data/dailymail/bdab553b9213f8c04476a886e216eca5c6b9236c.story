An undertaker lost an incredible 14 stone after his daughter feared he was going to become his own customer.

Colin Cuthell, 64, from Bo’ness, Scotland, tipped the scales at a whopping 31st, after years of binge eating and no exercise.

Mr Cuthell, who runs family funeral firm Thomas Cuthell & Sons, had type 2 diabetes caused by obesity and had to be pushed around in a wheelchair on family holidays.

Colin Cuthell, a 64-year-old funeral director, lost 14st after his daughter, Michelle, 31, warned him that he was in serious danger of becoming one of his own customers

Mr Cuthell (pictured with his wife, Marian) dropped from 31st to 17st by ditching his deep fat fryer and swapping unhealthy snacks for fruit and vegetables

But now he has transformed his life after his daughter, Michelle, 31, told him she didn’t want to lose him.

Mr Cuthell, who is 6ft 3ins, now weighs 17st.

He said: ‘Hearing my daughter say that really brought home to me how serious my weight issue had become.

‘I wanted to be around to walk her down the aisle and watch her have children but I knew my unhealthy ways would put me in an early grave.

‘In a few years I would have been dead if I’d continued with my unhealthy lifestyle.

‘My wife, Marian, had always nagged at me to lose weight but I never listened as I’d been big for so long I felt trapped.’

Mr Cuthell says that he feels he now has a new lease of life and that his life no longer hangs in the balance

Ms Cuthell, who works at the family run funeral directors, faces death on a daily basis, adding to her worry over her father’s health.

She said: ‘I was petrified about my dad just dropping down dead, I hear about it happening to people all the time with the job I have.

‘I’m such a daddy’s girl, we have always been really close, I couldn’t imagine losing him, it would be unimaginable.

‘Over the past few years he had become bigger than I’d ever seen him and I watched helplessly as his health deteriorated.

Ms Cuthell said: 'I'm such a daddy's girl, we have always been really close, I couldn't imagine losing him. Over the past few years he'd become bigger than I'd ever seen him - I watched helplessly as his health deteriorated'

‘I had to help him before it was too late, so I started researching weight loss options for him and I came across the Cambridge diet and researched it online.’

The pair met up with a consultant and Mr Cuthell’s staggering weight loss began.

Ms Cuthell said: ‘I’m so proud of him, it’s unbelievable how much weight he’s managed to lose.

‘He’s like a new man, no longer insecure or out of breath, it’s amazing, I feel like a proud parent even though he’s my dad.

Mr Cuthell worked unsociable hours which led to him eating at all hours of the day.

Mr Cuthell lost weight by joining the Cambridge Weight Plan which saw him swap normal meals for low calorie soups, shakes and bars

He would drink hot chocolate with heaps of sugar and often deep fried food for his dinner.

Thanks to the help of Cambridge Weight Plan he has managed to change his ways.

The Cambridge Weight Plan sees dieters swap their ordinary food for a range of specially formulated soups, shakes, bars and rice puddings.

People who follow the plan are also offered support from a consultant.

Mr Cuthell said: 'I wanted to be around to walk my daughter down the aisle and watch her have children but I knew my unhealthy ways would put me in an early grave. In a few years I would have been dead'

Mr Cuthell said: ‘I owe a lot to my daughter and my consultant, Deborah Paris. Thanks to them I have a new lease of life and my future is no longer hanging in the balance.’

Mr Cuthell has swapped his unhealthy snacks for fruit and vegetables. He has also ditched his deep fat fryer.

Cambridge Weight Plan consultant, Deborah Paris, said: ‘Colin is such a lovely guy, his weight loss will hopefully inspire many other people to do the same.

‘He’s an amazing man and it makes my day knowing how much healthier and happier he is now.’
