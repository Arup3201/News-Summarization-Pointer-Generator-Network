German art collector Cornelius Gurlitt, who owned more than a thousand pieces of valuable art

A landscape by Claude Monet has been found in a suitcase the late German collector Cornelius Gurlitt had with him during a hospital stay, becoming the latest piece to emerge from his long-hidden art trove.

The suitcase was left at the hospital for unknown reasons, and was handed over earlier this week to the court-appointed administrator of Gurlitt's estate, the task force investigating the piece's origin said today.

The find comes after officials reported finding a few more works at Gurlitt's Munich apartment in July, including a sculpture apparently by Edgar Degas.

Like the Monet, they were not among 1,280 pieces authorities seized from the apartment in 2012 while investigating a tax case, a collection that included works by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Marc Chagall. 

It was not immediately clear where the Monet was kept and why it was not seized.

The task force said it will check whether the Monet was stolen by the Nazis, as it is doing with many other works in Gurlitt's collection.

It said it appears after initial examination that the light-blue landscape, painted on paper, may have been produced around 1864. The subject appears very similar to the French artist's 'Garden of Sainte-Adresse'.

Gurlitt died at home in May after spending weeks in a hospital following heart surgery.

News of the art trove's seizure emerged only in November. Authorities had discovered the works while investigating Gurlitt for suspected import tax evasion.

He inherited the collection from his father Hildebrand, an art dealer who traded in works confiscated by the Nazis.

Gurlitt designated Switzerland's Kunstmuseum Bern as sole heir to his collection. The museum is considering whether to accept the bequest.

Shortly before he died, Gurlitt reached a deal with the German government to check whether hundreds of the works had been looted from Jewish owners by the Nazis.

Cornelius Gurlitt was a notorious German art hoarder who died in May aged 81.

His father, Hildebrand, was Adolf Hitler's art dealer, and dealt in works confiscated by the Nazis from Jews or museums.

His vast collection  was seized from his Munich apartment after a tax inquiry in 2012 - 1,280 pieces were found, including works by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse and Max Liebermann.

Gurlitt was investigated for tax reasons when he was found carrying huge wads of cash while on a train from Switzerland. 

The incredible array of art was estimated to be worth around £850million.

Depite the value of his assets, Gurlitt did not have an extravagant lifestyle, only selling a painting when he needed money.
