Prince Harry brought the Invictus Games to a close this evening and praised the hundreds of wounded servicemen and women who took part as 'inspiring' 

The pair had earlier watched a game of wheelchair basketball together at the Copper Box Arena.  

Dancing
 to the sounds of the Foo Fighters, the ecstatic prince vowed to unwind 
afterwards with a beer ahead of his 30th birthday today.

Thanking the 400 international competitors, he said: 'These games have shone a spotlight on the unconquerable character of servicemen and women and their families - their invictus spirit. 

'These games have been about seeing guys sprinting for the finish line and then turning round to clap the last man in. 

'They have been about team-mates choosing to cross the line together; not wanting to come second, but not wanting the other guys to either.

'These games have shown the very best of the human spirit.' 

'Many of us here this evening have friends who paid the ultimate sacrifice and are no longer with us; we should take a moment to remember them.

‘And then there are others, perhaps watching at home, at an earlier stage in their recovery or for whom the challenges ahead still seem insurmountable.‘

He also vowed to use money raised by his charity to help find work for servicemen and women returning from combat. 

Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters gave the royal a warm embrace as he took to the stage for the band's set 

British singer Ellie Goulding also performed at the concert where more than 20,000 people gathered 

'By definition, servicemen and women are highly skilled, well trained and motivated people. 

'Many of those injured are young men and women, with their whole lives ahead of them. For those no longer able to serve in the Armed Forces, the future is often uncertain.

‘However, we should be there, ready to support them, if or when they need it. For a few this may mean long term physical and mental support, but for the majority this means fulfilling employment. 

'Not special treatment, but to be treated as they were before injury, with respect, admiration and recognition of their considerable talent.

‘As the focus inevitably moves elsewhere; through the work of our Foundation, William and I will continue to draw attention to the challenges facing all those leaving the armed forces, whether wounded or not, to ensure they can do so with purpose, with hope and with confidence.

'They are a credit to our nation and to each nation here at these games.' 

A message from his grandmother The Queen read: 'As I have followed the competition over the past four days, I have been deeply moved by your courage, determination and talent.

'All of you have used the power of sport to enhance your own recovery and to raise wider awareness of the enormous challenges faced by wounded veterans. 

‘The success of these Games can be measured not by medals won, but by the renewed sense of purpose and confidence in your abilities that you have gained.'

Around 26,000 people gathered at the sold-out concert in Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park on Sunday

The audience, which included Harry's former girlfriend Cressida Bonas and Princess Eugenie, enjoyed a concert featuring the Foo Fighters, Kaiser Chiefs, The Vamps, Rizzle Kicks, James Blunt, Ellie Goulding, Ryan Adams and Military Wives Choir.

Singer James Blunt dedicated his hit You’re Beautiful to Harry, while Dave Grohl, lead singer of the Foo Fighters, revealed how Harry had got his number from a friend and called him personally to persuade him to play.

Earlier in the day, Harry said he would unwind with a birthday beer with Team GB captain Dave Henson. 

'On the birthday side of things, I'll be chuffed to bits when I'm having a beer with Dave Henson, captain of the GB team - we turn 30 at exactly the same time, on Sunday night,' he said. 

'We're really looking forward to being 30, both feeling quite old about it.' 

The ex-Army officer, who retired from the military in March, won gold in the 200 metres and a team gold in the seated volleyball in front of a screaming Copper Box arena crowd earlier today.

Mr Henson said: 'In terms of Britain's performance I'm feeling pretty ecstatic.' 

Harry was seen laughing as he was given a football shirt with reads 'I am 30' printed on the back during the last day of the Games. 

The words 'I Am' are taken from the logo of the games, which features them stacked above one another. 

It was believed that the Duchess of Cambridge was organising a party for Harry at Kensington Palace, but was forced to cancel after suffering morning sickness with her second child.

Speaking about the competitors he added: 'Rest assured these guys are going to party on Sunday night and they deserve to.'

It is thought that Harry was due at Kensington Palace last night for a party organised by Kate and his old friend and nightclub owner Guy Pelly.

However the prince instead stayed late into the evening watching Invictus events.

The Invictus Games is Paralympics-style championship, featuring competitions such as wheelchair rugby, sitting netball and indoor rowing.

Competitors, many with missing limbs or other serious injuries, welcomed the sporting challenge, while the auditoriums were full at most of the events. 

Harry said he will be marking his milestone birthday by having a beer with UK Armed Forces Team Captain Dave Henson (pictured left and right) who will turn 30 on the same day

The Queen said she had been 'deeply moved by the courage and determination' shown by the competitors 

Bryan Adams was among the many performers at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park on Sunday evening 

The closing ceremony also involved the handing out of the medals. Here Afghanistan, Australia and Italy take to the stage

Teen pop sensation The Vamps also took to the stage to close what could be the first of many Invictus Games

Harry launched the contest earlier this year after being inspired by a similar initiative in the US and hopes it will support rehabilitation and raise awareness of those injured serving their country.

The prince said yesterday he was 'over the moon' by how the Games had gone and suggested it could be staged next year outside of London.

Prince Harry gives an enthusiastic cheer as he watches the closing of the games he brought to the UK 

The Band of the Royal Marines played at the closing of the competition for wounded servicemen and women

The concert also featured a moving performance by the Military Wives; a choir made up of the spouses of servicemen who helps raise money for various armed forces charities

He said: 'We've now got America showing interest in 2016 and Canada showing interest in 2017 so the question is what do we do next year?

'I personally, along with a couple of other people on the board, would love to keep it in the UK, maybe head north whether it be Glasgow, whether it be Sheffield, whether it be Manchester.'
