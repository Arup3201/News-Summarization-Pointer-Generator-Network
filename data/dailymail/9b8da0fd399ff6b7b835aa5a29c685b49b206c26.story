A 100-year-old love letter and poppy sent from a World War One French battlefield to an American sweetheart has been discovered.

The faded poppy - believed to be the oldest surviving - was discovered enclosed in a heart-wrenching love letter in Derbyshire and is going up for auction.

The red flower was sent back by an American serviceman, with a letter, signed 'Chas', short for  Charles, to his 'Dearest girl'.

A rare WW1 battlefield poppy sent in a love letter from the fields of France to an American sweetheart is to be auctioned later this month

The letter, written on American YMCA paper, titled 'On Active Service with the American Expeditionary Force', begins with the words 'Dear Girl, I love you so, for your prayers and your love. If prayers will aide and they will God will take care of everything.'

The poignant letter was written on American YMCA paper and is expected to fetch around £5,000.

The soldiers letter titled 'On Active Service with the American Expeditionary Force', said: 'Dear Girl, I love you so, for your prayers and your love.

'If prayers will aide and they will God will take care of everything. Of course it is hard to understand this war in regards to the Lords will and means of protecting his people - but I guess it was not intended that we should understand.

'In the meantime I must stop - sweet girl, I will be so careful and you must be good and write very often.

'Tell me everything as you do and let the French poppy which I am enclosing represent my kisses for you - dearest girl, all my love. Remember me to mother - yours Chas.'

The letter continues: 'If prayers will aide and they will God will take care of everything. Of course it is hard to understand this war in regards to the Lords will and means of protecting his people - but I guess it was not intended that we should understand'

Auctioneer, Charles Hanson, said: 'Sadly nothing is known about Chas, a United States Armed Soldier who was sent to Europe in WW1, or his dearest girl back home in the USA.

'We can be fairly sure - that the French poppy picked up by an American serviceman represents a latter battle of WW1, perhaps when victory was in sight.'

The United States campaigns in WW1 saw the Expeditionary Forces fight in France alongside The French and British Allied Forces in the last year of the war against The Imperial German Forces.

By May 1918 over 1,000,000 US troops were stationed in France, with half of them on the front lines.

The AEF helped the French Army on the Western Front during the Aisne offensive in June 1918, fighting its major actions in Saint Mihiel in late 1918.

Mr Hanson said: 'I am unaware of any other WW1 French poppies in American collections or museums, and certainly I feel the endearing nature of the letter, containing such romance and affection together with the French poppy representing love and remembrance, is something to be preserved for posterity.

'In the meantime I must stop - sweet girl, I will be so careful and you must be good and write very often. Tell me everything as you do and let the French poppy which I am enclosing represent my kisses for you - dearest girl, all my love. Remember me to mother - yours Chas' the letter concludes

'Whilst we will never know whether Chas survived WW1, and returned to his beloved, his words live on reminding us of those brave men and their families.'

The poppy has come to represent the immeasurable sacrifice made by comrades, and has become a lasting memorial to those who died in WW1.

Mr Hanson said: 'Value is in the sentiment and what the letter represents - I hope the letter finds a new home and value is hard to assess - I hope it fulfils its heart strings and the pull is worldwide.'

The rare battlefield poppy will be sold by Charles Hanson, manager of Hansons Auctioneers in Derbyshire, on Monday 28th April.

The poppy was one of the few plants able to grow on the otherwise barren battlefields of World War One. It has since come to represent the huge sacrifice made by millions of

allied soldiers and become a lasting memorial to those who died in the conflict.

The poppy was subsequently adopted by the Royal British Legion for their fundraising appeal in aid of those who served, and continue to serve, in the British Armed Forces, after its formation in 1921, with poppy wreaths used on Remembrance Day each year, to commemorate those who served.
