Tottenham defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto has been hit with a three match ban and £50,000 fine for backing Nicolas Anelka's controversial 'quenelle' celebration last season.

With the gesture known to have anti-Semitic connotations, the punishment is particularly embarrassing for the Cameroon star given Spurs' strong Jewish heritage.

Anelka, playing for West Brom at the time, made the gesture having scored against West Ham on December 28 - with the Baggies sacking the striker following their own internal investigation.

Benoit Assou-Ekotto has been hit with three-game ban by the Football Association and fined £50,000 

Nicolas Anelka was hit with an £80,000 fine and banned for five matches following his 'quenelle' gesture 

Assou-Ekotto was charged by the FA after sending a tweet to Anelka congratulating him on the gesture and, despite the 30-year-old's denial of wrongdoing, has been punished.

The left-back insisted he was congratulating Anelka from an anti-establishment viewpoint.

And Mr Peter Griffiths QC, the chairman of the Independent Regulatory Commission that heard Assou-Ekotto's concurred, saying: 'Even though we have found that there was an aggravated breach of FA Rule E3 we are satisfied that when the Player sent the tweet on the 28th December 2013 congratulating Anelka, in his mind he believed he was congratulating Anelka on what he perceived to be an anti-establishment gesture as opposed to one associated with anti-Semitism.' 

In a statement from Assou-Ekotto, he added: 'I am obviously very pleased that the FA has accepted I am not an anti-Semite. I have always said that when I tweeted Nicholas Anelka I was congratulating him on an anti-establishment gesture and NOT on an anti-Semitic gesture.

'The finding against me was that I breached the FA's rules but that my breach was unintentional. I have always loved the fans of Spurs and I want to assure them that I would never knowingly behave in a racist or anti-Semitic manner.' Meanwhile, UEFA have launched a formal investigation into the anti-Semitic banner that overshadowed Tottenham's 0-0 draw against Partizan Belgrade on Thursday night. 

Liverpool's Mamadou Sakho, playing against Ludogorets, escaped with a warnings for a similar incident

A banner that read: 'Only Jews and Pussies' - a play on comedy show Only Fools and Horses - was on display amongst Partizan fans.

The banner was included in Israeli referee Alon Yevet's and the UEFA match delegate's reports on Friday morning.

Sportsmail understands Partizan officials were made aware of the banner by UEFA officials during the game, but the Serbian club's failure to act is believed to have angered European football's governing body.

UEFA are also concerned at how the large banner was allowed to be taken into the stadium by home supporters.

It now looks highly likely Partizan will face punishment from UEFA, with a partial ground closure for their next Europa League home clash and fine a possible sanction.

The matter will be decided by UEFA's disciplinary committee during their next meeting on October 16. 

Hull's Yannick Sagbo served a two-game ban and was fined £15,000 having also given his support to Anelka

Partizan moved quickly to apologise for the offensive banner with a statement, that read: 'The football match between Partizan and Tottenham was eagerly awaited in our city and we watched fine performances from both teams in a fair-play sporting atmosphere.

'But this game was marred by malicious act of certain individuals who made all the efforts from our players and our club to prove we deserve our spot in football Europe worthless.

'FC Partizan resolutely disavows with anti-Semitic banner displayed yesterday. The message displayed on that banner is completely opposite to preferences and opinions of almost all citizens of Serbia and Partizan fans.

'It is absolutely absurd to link a club that was founded after the WWII on anti-fascist principles and after the battle of people of Europe with anti-Semitism and similar dark and anti-civilisation impulses.

'We fully condemn perpetrators of this mindless act, not only of anti-Semitic nature, but one that represents hatred of Partizan and Serbia as well.

"We believe this vicious action will not spoil our sporting friendship with Tottenham and football aficionados in Great Britain. In cooperation with competent authorities, Partizan FC will do everything to locate, trial and ban those perpetrators from sporting fields.

'We apologise to everyone who found themselves insulted and upset by this banner. Once again, we point out that such banner message is completely opposite to history and tradition of our club, and our fans' aspirations.'
