A Malaysian bank official and her husband have been charged with stealing more than $30,000 from the bank accounts of four victims of flight MH370.

Nur Shila Kanan, 33, who works at HSBC, and her 33-year-old husband Basheer Ahmad Maula Sahul Hameed, a mechanic, deny taking 110,643 ringgit ($34,850) from the accounts of four victims of the plane tragedy.

The couple, who have three children, allegedly withdrew money from the accounts of two Malaysians and two Chinese nationals via ATMs and electronic transfers between May 14 and July 8.

On one occasion, officials claim, Kanan transferred more than $12,000 from the account of a Malaysian citizen into that of a Chinese citizen - before applying for a debit card in the Chinese citizen's name.

Appearing before a court in Kuala Lumpur today, Kanan and Hameed pleaded not guilty to 16 charges, according to their lawyer.

The pair could face decades in prison if convicted. The charges include illegally transferring money electronically which carries a ten year sentence alone.

The
 thefts were discovered after employees at the Kuala Lumpur branch of 
HSBC, where Kanan has worked for ten years, noticed that money had gone 
missing from victims’ accounts and called police.

Officers are still looking for another suspect, a Pakistani, who is believed to have had some of the money deposited into his bank account through an online transfer.

According
 to reports, the transactions were made on July 18 when money from the 
accounts of three passengers was transferred to the account of a fourth 
passenger before it was removed.

A
 source told the New Straits Times: 'We believe the suspect withdrew the
 money through the fourth victim's account via several automated teller 
machines (ATMs) in the Klang Valley.'

International effort: Australia's deputy prime minister Warren Truss unveiled the latest search plan at a press conference in Canberra last Wednesday. The government has contracted a new firm to take up the search

The news comes as search teams are about
 to start investigating 60,000 square kilometres of the Indian Ocean for
 evidence of the aircraft.

Efforts
 to locate Flight MH370 have spanned more than five months, making it 
one of the most expensive searches for a plane in aviation history.

The Joint Agency Coordination Centre claims the rescue operation is making 'good progress'.

Teams are still scanned a 60,000-square-kilometre area in the Indian Ocean, with a deep-water search planned for September.

No trace: The flight carrying 239 people diverted off its route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing without trace

Confusion: The search started near Thailand but has since moved south. Hopes were ignited after satellite images from the new search area appeared to show parts of a plane in the water, but it turned out to be debris

Flight
 370 disappeared mysteriously in March with 239 people on board after 
diverging from its planned route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. 

The airline was widely criticised for its handling of the crisis. In a desperate bid to save face following two major disasters within months, bosses are now considering rebranding the airline.

Officials said they are looking at a number of options to restructure the business which could include changing its name.

Among
 the other changes the Malaysian flag carrier is considering are new 
routes and expanding out-sourcing to increase profitability.

It
 follows the death of 298 passengers after flight MH17 was shot down 
over Ukraine on July 17 and the disappearance of flight MH370 on March 
8, which was carrying 239 passengers and crew.

The Malaysian flag carrier will also seek new investors to rebuild its business.
