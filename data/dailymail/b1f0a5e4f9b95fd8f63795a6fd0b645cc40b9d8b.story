Have you seen Mr Rabbit?  A three-year-old's happiness depends upon it.

Little Ruby Stewart lost her somewhat bedraggled soft toy in London during a family trip at the weekend, and has cried herself to sleep every night since.

Her desperate mother Zoe, 29, who lives in Edinburgh, launched an online appeal for her daughter's furry friend, and now thousands of people, including TV presenters Cherry Healey and Kirstie Allsopp, have joined the search.

The tweet that launched a rabbit hunt: Ruby Stewart's Mr Rabbit soft toy has been missing since Sunday

Desperate appeal: Ruby's mother Zoe put Mr Rabbit's photo on Facebook where it was shared by thousands

Mrs Stewart, who was visiting the capital with husband Keith, 36, a driver, and their daughter, tweeted a photo of the Jellycat bunny with the message: 'LOST!!!!!  Lovely people of London please keep your eyes open and retweet if you can, one super upset wee girl :(  '

Mr Rabbit, whom Ruby calls her 'best friend', was lost somewhere between Oxford Street and East Dulwich in south London on Sunday, since when the little girl has been inconsolable.

Her mother put up missing posters on social media sites including Twitter, Instagram and Facebook, with a picture of the brown rabbit and the word 'Lost!' and within hours it had been retweeted and shared around the world.

Today, three days on and despite several false alarms, Mr Rabbit remains at large, while thousands of people have taken up the hunt.

Mrs Stewart told MailOnline: 'The response has been unbelievable - I didn't know there were that many nice people out there.

'I've had 50 people offering to send me their toy rabbits, and even people from America offering to send Ruby a postcard from Disneyland so she thinks Mr Rabbit is having a nice time on holiday.'

She said she had a spare Mr Rabbit at home, which is identical and which has been washed every time the original has.

She said: 'When we got back home on Sunday night we got out the spare and gave it to Ruby and said "Here he is", but Ruby smelled him and said "No, that's not Mr Rabbit."  She just knew.'

Describing the much-loved toy as 'a little tatty' and smelling 'of Olbas Oil', Ms Stewart wrote: 'He was there when she was in hospital, he was there when she had chicken pox, her first tooth, the first time she fell and skint her knee or bumped her head.

'He’s seen it all.'

Ms Stewart, a photographer, added: 'He is very loved and missed and a little tatty.

Always by my side: Ruby is never without Mr Rabbit, and has been inconsolable since he went missing

Much loved: Mr Rabbit was a present to Ruby from her grandmother when she was just one day old

Mr Rabbit is described as 'a little tatty' and 'smelling of Olbas Oil', but his owner Ruby wants him back

Mr Rabbit has accompanied Ruby everywhere, including on this trip to Paris, with Ruby's father, Keith

'His neck has no stuffing left from being hugged so much so flops to one side and his ears smell like Olbas Oil.

The toy, a present from Ruby's grandmother when Ruby was just one day old, was lost somewhere between Carnaby Street and Oxford Street, where Ruby's family had lunch, and East Dulwich, to which they took the Tube and train.

Channel 4 presenter Kirstie Allsopp was one of the first celebrities to publicise the search for the lost bunny, and Mr Rabbit's image has now been viewed more than 130,000 times online.
