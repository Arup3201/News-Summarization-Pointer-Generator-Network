The magazine is a stalwart at news stands, and has long been the Bible for any television addict.

And now the Radio Times has turned 90 years old - and its rich history displayed in a museum exhibition.

The Museum of London's Cover Story: Radio Times at 90 celebrates the history of Radio Times, featuring landmark broadcasts, archive clips, broadcast artefacts and original Radio Times photography and artwork.

Then and now: The Radio Times has been going for 90 years since its first ever edition published on September 28, 1923, pictured left. The magazine celebrated its 90th anniversary in this week's issue, pictured right

Retro: The Radio Times published its first ever Christmas cover on December 12, 1923, pictured left, and another Radio Times Christmas cover designed by Edward McKnight Kauffer which was published on December 17, 1926, pictured right

Momentous moments: The Radio Times starts to cover television programme schedules in its edition 
published on November 10, 1936, pictured left, as TVs become more 
accessible to the general public and a special issue to mark the coronation of King George on May 7, 1937, pictured right

It also showcases some of its iconic covers from the last nine decades, which reflect the story of broadcasting in Britain.

The
covers featured comprise a veritable who’s who of British broadcasting,
including Tony Hancock, The Goon Show, Only Fools and Horses and, of 
course, Doctor Who.

They also prove that you don't have to be a regular of a soap opera to become the greatest cover model.

The
Queen, who usually only appears on television once a year to give her 
Christmas speech, has been on the cover more than anyone else in the 
publication's history, the Daily Express reported.

Her Majesty has graced the cover 35 times since she first appeared on it in 1940.

War time coverage: Just days after the start of the Second World War, the Radio Times told its readers broadcasting would continue on September 4, 1939, pictured left, and it continued printing throughout the war, including this edition, pictured right on May 10, 1940

Sign of the times: The Radio Times ran with a picture of British soldiers during WWII on August 9, 1940, and opted for The Beatles on its front cover on December 5, 1963, pictured right

History of TV: Dr Who and the Daleks take over the front page of the Radio Times on November 19, 1964, pictured left, and the World Cup dominates the front page on July 7, 1966, pictured right

Popular culture: The Daleks are back on the 
front page on November 3, 1966, pictured left, while the Radio Times 
covers the beginnings of satellite TV on June 22, 1967, pictured right

Following her is treasured presenter Sir David Attenborough, who has appeared on the cover 20 times since 1956.

The third cover star is actor David Tennant, who has graced the front page 19 times - 12 of which during his time as Doctor Who.

The exhibition also features an 
exclusive Doctor Who display, a Radio Times regular since 1964 that 
celebrates its 50th anniversary this year.

Visitors
will be able to become a cover star for themselves, alongside a genuine
life-size Dalek against a backdrop of Westminster Bridge, recreating 
the famous 2005 'Vote Dalek' Radio Times cover.

This was voted most iconic cover of all time in the Periodical Publishers Association's Great Cover Debate in 2008.

First
published by the BBC in London on 28 September 1923, Radio Times has 
had a long, illustrious life, documenting popular culture in TV and 
radio and national events watched by millions.

Few know that despite its lighthearted content, the magazine was targeted by Nazis during World War II.

The
exhibition will show an illuminating original 1941 Luftwaffe Stadtplan 
von London map which plots Radio Times’ Waterlows printing plant in Park
Royal, London, as a Nazi air-raid target alongside transport hubs, 
factories and landmarks.  

Radio
Times staff had been moved to the plant from central London at the 
beginning of the war, and the plant, which also printed fellow BBC 
magazine The Listener, became a target as part of the war on propaganda.

Vital to Britain’s war 
effort, the BBC and its journal Radio Times became strategically 
important targets for Nazi bombers attacking London.

The Queen, who usually only appears on television once a year to give her Christmas speech, has been on the cover more than anyone else, and was closely followed by presenter Sir David Attenborough

The exhibition also features an exclusive Doctor Who display, a Radio Times regular since 1964
