Lewis Hamilton could crack under the pressure of fighting to win his second Formula One championship, his former rival Felipe Massa has warned. 

Hamilton has been cast 29 points adrift of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg ahead of this weekend's British Grand Prix. 

The British star, who robbed Massa of the championship in the most dramatic of circumstances at the season finale in Brazil six years ago, has been hit with two mechanical retirements this year, while Rosberg has finished either first or second at every race. But Massa, speaking on the eve of his 200th Formula One start, believes Hamilton has been outsmarted by his team-mate so far this season. 

'Lewis is one of the greatest drivers in terms of speed, and he has incredible talent,' Massa told Sportsmail. 'I would say Nico is losing a little bit, in terms of speed compared to Lewis, but maybe he is using a bit more of his brain.

Trailing: The Brit is 29 points behind German team-mate Nico Rosberg heading to Silverstone

'From now until the last race we might see that Lewis is back to his top form, winning races and starting from pole, but maybe not. Maybe he is under pressure because he is behind in the championship, so Nico can use that to his favour.'

Hamilton came to within one race of making grand prix history and being crowned champion in his first year in the sport in 2007.

But he blew a 12-point lead with just two races remaining, spinning into the gravel on his entrance to the pits and retiring from the penultimate race in China, before finishing only seventh at the final grand prix in Brazil.

A year 
later, Hamilton returned to Interlagos to win the title, but only after 
he passed the Toyota of Timo Glock on the last corner of the last lap in
 torrid conditions, to stop Massa, who won the race, from claiming the 
title. 

'When
 you are at at team where the worst situation is you finish second, a 
driver who has lost all the points because he did not finish has a big, 
big impact and that is what has happened with Lewis,' added Massa in 
reference to Hamilton's retirements in Australia and Canada.

'It makes his pressure higher, and his work higher, but he cannot be so nervous about it otherwise he could lose even more. Lewis was a driver that maybe lost under the pressure when he was fighting for the championship in 2007 and 2008, but maybe he has a little bit more experience now. I don't know if that will help or not, but for sure he has more pressure now than Nico.'

Massa arrives at Silverstone in good form after he stunned the paddock by claiming the first non-Mercedes pole of the year in Austria last month. 

It was his first in almost six years, and comes after he moved to Williams over the winter, frustrated by playing second fiddle to Fernando Alonso at Ferrari. 

'I am at a team which really respects me 100 per cent and want to do everything they can to make me competitive again - to fight for podiums but also for victories, too,' he explains. 

'When people spend so long at a place, a change is like a re-start and you feel younger and you need that. I needed that and maybe even Ferrari, too. So, it was the right change which came at the right time.'

Close: The Brazilian was disappointed to miss out on the podium and finish fourth in Spielberg

Massa admitted he was disappointed to finish only fourth after starting from pole, but the Brazilian was fortunate to even be on the grid at the Red Bull Ring following his spectacular 190mph crash with Sergio Perez in Canada a fortnight previously.

'I was sure it was going to hurt because it was so quick,' Massa said as he recalled the last-lap horror smash which saw both he and Perez admitted to hospital. 

'It is the worst feeling you can have knowing that the wall is coming at you so quickly. I pulled 27G on the crash but thank God I am here and nothing happened to me.'

Massa, 33, will be joined by an unfamiliar face on track this weekend, when Britain's Williams' development driver Susie Wolff becomes the first female in more than two decades to participate at a grand prix weekend.

'I think it is fantastic and great to see a lady driving the car , so I will try to help her in any way I can,' Massa said of Wolff, who will take to the wheel in Friday's practice session. 

'I hope Susie does a good job with the opportunity she has, and it is not just because she is a lady. It depends how quick she can be, but what experience, performance and talent she can show to the team.'

Tense: Brazil face Colombia in the World Cup quarter-final on Friday

Back in his native country, Brazil, who are battling to win the World Cup in front of an expectant home crowd, face Colombia in their quarter-final clash on Friday. 

'I know how it is to win at home, and fight for the championship at home, so if we can win the World Cup it will be like a big dream coming true,' he says.  

'But honestly, I am a sportsman and I know how difficult it is, and it doesn't always happen in the perfect way. The result might not be what you expect and this is part of sport, but Brazilians do not think like that. If you are second then you have lost. 

'That is really tough but it is the mentality. I know if we do not win, the media will be very strong and the people, too. I don't enjoy it so much, but that is the way it is.'
