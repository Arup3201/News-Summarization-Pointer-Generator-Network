Women bosses lack humour and personality in the workplace compared with their male counterparts because they feel ‘pressure to be superhuman’, according to a leading businesswoman.

Nicky Dulieu, chief executive of fashion chain Hobbs, also claimed that women at the helm of major companies ‘need more conﬁdence’ and tend to hide their personalities.  

Her remarks follow a survey by the company that found more than a third of women preferred to work for a man.

The survey of more than 2,500 adults found that only ten per cent of women preferred having a woman manager, with 34 per cent saying that they would rather work for a man.

Miss Dulieu, 49, claimed a typical female employee has a ‘tendency to look to men as her preferred leader’ and suggested women need more support to establish themselves within businesses.

Deference to senior males means women in management often hide their own personalities, she said. 

‘We hide our natural personalities, and need more conﬁdence. When I realised that being 'me' wasn’t a bad thing in business – that I’m not the toughest or always right – it was a good thing for me', she said. 

‘There is so much pressure on women to be superhuman, they have no personality in the process.’

She added: ‘It is clear women need 
more support in building not only with their own confidence in the 
workplace, but also confidence in one another.

‘This
 seems particularly important in the early years of a woman’s career 
when she appears to have a tendency to look to men as her preferred 
leader.’

Miss Dulieu, who started at Marks & Spencer as a trainee accounts clerk, went on to become an executive at the company.

The
 daughter of a toolmaker and a hairdresser, who grew up in Chingford, 
North East London, she joined Hobbs in 2008 and has seen the company 
surge in popularity.

Kate and Pippa Middleton are among its biggest fans and have been frequently seen wearing the label.

But, describing her insecurity upon first joining, Miss Dulieu said  she felt like an ‘imposter’ and expected somebody to ‘expose’ her lack of expertise.

‘You’re waiting to ﬁnd out you’re not as good as you think you are,’ she said. 

Calling for more women role models, she added: ‘Women need to support each other more; have a  network you can trust and where you can share those insecurities.’

‘I also think it’s about identifying women who do inﬂuence the rest of their teams and making sure that they understand the right, natural way of doing it: being themselves.’

Miss Dulieu has previously spoken about donning her jeans and wellies at weekends as escapism from her busy life in the boardroom.

She once said: ‘That’s where my creativity comes out. I’m what you would call a cottage gardener.’

Hobbs, which has a male chairman and an all-female board, commissioned the research to gain an insight into working women who work in the store.

The survey found that women aged between 25 and 34 were most likely to prefer a male boss.

It found men preferred working for management of the same sex, with more than a quarter of male employees saying they preferred a male boss and only eight per cent saying they would rather work for a woman.

However, and perhaps most inspiring for businesswomen looking to ascend to the boardroom, overall 61 per cent of respondents said they did not care about the sex of their boss.

The only age bracket which preferred to work for a woman boss was also the youngest – aged between 18 and 24.

Despite the overall preference for male bosses, the survey found that women scored highest in four areas – good communication, listening and organisation skills – deemed essential for a leader. 

Male bosses were described as more inspiring, logical and having a better sense of humour.
