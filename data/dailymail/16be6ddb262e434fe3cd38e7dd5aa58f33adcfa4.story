The so-called 'Naked Rambler' Stephen Gough has been arrested three days after he was released from prison.

Gough, a former Royal Marine who hikes across the country naked, was arrested in Townhill, 
Dunfermline, this afternoon by officers from Fife Constabulary.

He was released from Perth Prison on Tuesday, having spent the past six years in the Scottish jail.

A spokesman for 
Fife Constabulary said he was arrested following complaints from members
of the public and has been charged with breach of the peace.

The
53-year-old, from Eastleigh in Hampshire, earned the nickname by 
walking unclothed from Land’s End to John O’Groats after quitting his 
job as a lorry driver.

'Naked Rambler' Stephen Gough has been arrested three days after being released from prison

He said earlier this week that he planned to walk to England to see his family.

He
told the Sun: 'My children are teenagers so I expect they are 
embarrassed by me. If I was them and my dad was walking around naked, I 
suppose I would be embarrassed.'

Wearing just a backpack – he had few other belongings when he entered 
maximum security Perth Prison – Gough stood still to enjoy the 
breeze.

He was arrested within 60 seconds of his last release and fully expected the police to do so again.

But, in an apparent shift in attitude, the rambler had been allowed to go on his way.

At the time, he vowed to continue walking around Britain without any clothes on – albeit away from busy main roads.

Gough is interviewed following his release from Perth Prison a few days ago

On his release a few days ago, he said: 'It is nice to be standing here feeling the breeze.

'I haven't been outside a building in the last six years and it is nice to smell the flowers and see the greenery.

'I was kept in solitary all the time. I wasn't given association with 
other prisoners. I got half an hour in the evening to have a shower and 
walk up and down the hall when they had been locked away.'

Gough was jailed for 657 days last August for a breach of the peace and contempt of court.

The breach was leaving HMP Perth naked after finishing his previous sentence.

He was also found to be in contempt after representing himself at the sheriff's court – naked.

Gough, who has been convicted 17 times in 10 years, immediately returned to the very cell he had left only hours earlier.

It is a pattern that has repeated itself since May 2006.

He said his latest jail term had 'flown 
by' and that he had been looking forward to seeing his teenage children, Kiana, 
16, and Yarin, 14.

'The first thing I have to do is look through my stuff as I haven't seen it in six years,' he said.

'I am going to head south and see what happens. I haven't seen my kids 
for ages. It's not all free and easy for me as I might get arrested at 
any moment.

'I don't know what I am going to do. I could get arrested when I go round the next corner.'

And sure enough, that is what happened today.

He added: 'This is my job. This is my vocation in life at the moment. I have absolutely no regrets.

Before being re-arrested, the eccentric father-of-two had planned to 'head south' on his next naked journey

'To conform with everyone else is the easiest way but when you conform 
you compromise your principles. I am not going to give up. Stay naked is
the word.'

Gough became known as the Naked Rambler after he tried to walk unclothed from Land's End to John O'Groats in 2003.

He was repeatedly arrested and served four months in Inverness Prison, 
reaching John O'Groats in 2004.

He set off again in 2005 and was 
repeatedly arrested once he reached Scotland, serving two prison 
sentences before arriving in 2006.

He returned home but on a flight back
to Scotland in May 2006 he was detained once again for a breach of the 
peace after he went to the toilet and removed his clothes. He has been 
in prison ever since.

While in prison Gough kept fit by doing step-ups on a chair in his cell.

On his last release, Gough was arrested 
within 60 seconds for breaching the peace.

He
appeared naked in the court dock and was also found guilty of contempt 
of court for failing to display the 'decency' required by the court 
process.

Gough had 
claimed arresting him for walking around naked was a breach of his human
rights and his right to freedom of expression.

Sheriff
Fletcher said: 'The court expects people to come here in a decent state
of dress. That has been explained to you in the past. I gave you the 
opportunity to dress yourself.'

Despite
his preference for nakedness, Gough did concede that he could 
understand why people would want to wear clothes in a country with 
Scotland’s cold climate.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
