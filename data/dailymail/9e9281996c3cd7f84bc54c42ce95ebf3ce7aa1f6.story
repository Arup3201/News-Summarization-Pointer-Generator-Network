Despite the rhetoric about moving on too fast from a previous lover, a new study has found those who do move on quickly are emotionally better-off.

The study by researchers at City University of New York and the University of Illinois discovered people who entered into a rebound relationship, defined as a relationship where the individual still has romantic attachments to their ex-partner, are happier and have healthier relationships.

The findings also show people in new relationships were more confident and felt more attractive than those left trying to get over the heartbreak alone.

Get over it: A study by psychologists proves wallowing in a blur 
of Vodka and Chaka Khan like the fictional character Bridget Jones after
 a break-up is not the answer. People should instead move-on into a 
rebound relationship

It has been previously thought to be healthier to not enter into a new relationship while still harbouring feelings for an ex, but the study effectively proves rebound relationships may be more psychologically beneficial than typically thought.

The study also proved that the quicker people move-on, not only are they personally happier, but they can also have happier relationships.

Very little psychological research has been carried out into the benefits of moving on quickly before, but in the two studies carried out by both universities, the people who had moved-on quickly were ‘more confident in their desirability and had more resolution over their ex-partner’.

The study assessed the people’s well-being, their feelings about their ex-partner, and whether they were seeing someone new.

Despite the odds a rebound relationship really can be the best way to 
mend a broken heart and go on to have a happier, healthier relationship,
 much like the eventual storyline in The Rebound

Claudia Brumbaugh, Department of Psychology, Queens College, City University of New York, said: ‘A “rebound relationship” is commonly understood as a relationship that is initiated shortly after a romantic breakup—before the feelings about the former relationship have been resolved. 

‘Little research has examined the consequences of quickly beginning new romantic relationships after another has ended. In two studies we examined people who experienced a breakup and assessed their well-being, their feelings about their ex-partner, and whether they were seeing someone new. 

‘Analyses indicated that people in new relationships were more confident in their desirability and had more resolution over their ex-partner. 

‘Among those in new relationships, the speed with which they began their relationship was associated with greater psychological and relational health. Overall, these findings suggest that rebound relationships may be more beneficial than typically believed.’
