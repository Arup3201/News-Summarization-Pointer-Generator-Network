The Duchess of Cambridge cut a swathe through the gloomy weather this afternoon as she stepped on to the Spirit of Chartwell wearing a vibrant scarlet Alexander McQueen dress.

Topping off the bright outfit with a flamboyant red hat by Sylvia Fletcher from royal milliner James Lock & Co, Kate made sure the public lining the banks of the Thames would be able to spot her easily aboard the barge.

Fletcher designed the Duchess's distinctive red maple leaf hat worn on her tour of Canada last summer.

Majestic:
 The 1,000-strong flotilla started its journey at Battersea bridge and 
will draw to a close at Tower Bridge, where the Royals will 
disembark to watch the grand finale

The barge is set to take the senior 
royals, including the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince 
Harry, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Queen, on their voyage 
along the Thames today.

The Spirit of Chartwell's journey 
will come to an end at Tower Bridge where the Royals will disembark to 
watch a stunning finale as the remainder of the 1,000 crafts pass by.

Once the Duke and Duchess  of Cambridge had taken their positions on the royal barge, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh 
boarded the Britannia launch to reach the barge, which was moored a 
quarter of a mile from Chelsea Pier.

The Duchess of Cambridge's red Alexander McQueen outfit was a vibrant but safe choice which allowed the Queen to shine on her big day, one fashion expert said today.

The 2011 Alexander McQueen fitted dress with pleats in the skirt was a similar shade to the scarlet Marianne coat by Catherine Walker Kate wore on the final day of her tour of Canada.

Carly Wood, who set up the katemiddletonstyle.org blog, said: 'It immediately reminded me of Kate's all-red patriotic ensemble from Calgary, on her final day in Canada last year.

'I was assuming she'd go for red, white or blue today. I love that it's bright and vibrant and a nice contrast to the weather.

'It's a little safe in my opinion, but then I expected that - it is after all the Queen's big day and the Queen should take centre stage - not Kate and her outfit.'

The dress is 2011 Alexander McQueen and was also worn, without sleeves, by reality TV star Kim Kardashian and Tulisa Contostavlos at the X factor auditions last year.

Kate's version today had full length sleeves and a longer hemline than the original.

It
 would likely have been an emotional moment for the Queen, who wept when
 the Britannia was decommissioned in 1997, as the launch had accompanied
 her on dozens of voyages across the globe.

The Royal Standard was raised as the 
Queen's launch arrived alongside the Spirit of Chartwell, where Kate, 
William and Harry were waiting for her.

The Queen had chosen a stunning 
silver and white dress and matching coat for the occasion.

The outfit 
has been a year in the 
planning and was designed by Angela Kelly and made by her small in-house
 Buckingham Palace team.

The coat, its matching dress and the hat were 
made by Angela Kelly's small in-house Buckingham Palace team.

Its colour scheme was chosen to stand
 out against the red, gold and purple hues of the royal barge, The 
Spirit of Chartwell, on which the Queen will enjoy an hour and a half 
long voyage today.

The outfit, created from
 white bouclé and threaded throughout with silk ribbon, was embroidered 
with gold, silver and ivory paillettes and embellished with 
Swarovski crystals to reflect the sparkling water of the River Thames.

The neckline was finished with a finished with a silk organza frill, 
which ran the length of the coat.

Her wardrobe choices met with resounding approval from royal fans gathered by the Thames.

Julia James, 18, and her sisters Vicky, 17, and Tania, 12, from Malvern in Worcestershire, were full of praise.

'That dress is amazing,' said Julia.

'It's stunning and it suits her so well. She was so nice too.

'We shook her hand and she was asking how long we'd been here and talking about the pageant. She was so lovely.'

Tania added: 'I was asking her if she was scared and she said she would be scared when all the boats arrived.'

Huge cheers erupted as Kate stepped on to the pier followed by William, dressed in RAF uniform, and Harry, wearing the No 1 ceremonial dress of the Blues and Royals.

The
 Queen's hat featured a sculptural brim with a sweeping upward curve, 
echoing the waves of the water.

The crown of the hat is made of the same
 material as the coat.

Details on the hat included feathers hand dyed in
 Buckingham Palace by one of Miss Kelly's team, a sprinkling of more 
crystals and swathes of ivory organza.
