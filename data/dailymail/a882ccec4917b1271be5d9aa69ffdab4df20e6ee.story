The lights are up, the tree is sparkling, carols are being sung, mince pies baked and it's finally December: the countdown to Christmas has officially begun.

But despite all the festive giddiness, some men won't be prioritising gift-buying, with one in five leaving their seasonal shopping until Christmas Eve, and ten per cent not even bothering to buy their partner a gift at all.

Furthermore, an impersonal fifth of men simply give cash to their beloved come 25 December.

Ten per cent of men give their partner nothing on 25 December... and one fifth give cash instead of a thoughtful gift

Some 40 per cent of men admit they buy their other half their gift while they're out shopping together, while on in five leave all their gift-gathering until Christmas Eve

More than half of UK's men start 
thinking about their Christmas shopping today, according to research, yet only four per cent have bought their 
gifts.

One third of men blame being disorganised (35 per cent) as being the reason
 for the last minute panic buys.

A further 10 per cent admit they will 
deliberately leave their gift-buying until post-Christmas to bag a 
bargain in the sale.

Almost half the nation's women (40 per cent) admit they would be genuinely upset if their loved-one got them a Christmas present they didn't want

And a further 40 per cent admit they buy their other half their gift while they're out shopping together, according to research from buyagift.com, who polled 2000 adults on their Christmas shopping habits.

Research also showed us to have a lack of trust in our partners when it comes to presents, with a third of the nation saying they have no faith in their partners gifting abilities whatsoever.

This doesn't bode well with keeping the peace over the festive break: nearly half the nation's women (40 per cent) admit they would be genuinely upset if their loved-one got them a Christmas present they didn't want.

Dan Mountain, CEO of buyagift.com, said: 'There is a lot to organise at Christmas and it can be a busy and stressful time of year, but that's no excuse to be a scrooge this December.

'Though it looks like the nation's men are letting the side down, many of us have no faith in our other half's gifting abilities.
