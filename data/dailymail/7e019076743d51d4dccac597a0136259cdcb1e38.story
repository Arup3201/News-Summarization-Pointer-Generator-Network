Gareth Southgate praised his England side for 'being prepared to pass the ball' even when things got tough after they saw off Croatia 4-2 on aggregate to progress to the 2015 European Championship in the Czech Republic.

The Three Lions boss was impressed with his team's ability to keep hold of possession during their 2-1 play-off second-leg victory in Vinkovci on Tuesday.

The game was evenly poised with the score 1-1 at half-time, but Southgate believes his players' bravery in continuing to press high and pass the ball saw England through.

Goals from from Leicester City centre back Liam Moore and Derby County midfielder Liam Moore were enough to see the Three Lions safely advance to next June's tournament.

And Southgate was even humorous in his own self-depreciation in the FA TV video, joking that maybe the England teams he played in struggled to keep the ball because he was in the side. 

And, speaking to the players in the dressing room after the game, Southgate said: 'You all take on board ideas.

'People say we couldn't play like that - I've not played in England teams who could keep the ball like that. It might have been because the centre back couldn't use it...

'But it's a f****** credit to you - you can go and you can change people's opinions of what we're about and what we're capable of doing.' 

Gareth Southgate: 'Listen, I think all I can say is that's how good you can be - that's how good you can be, OK?

'Everything we've asked you to do - not just tonight, but over the 12 months - you've responded to. Fantastic, everybody in the whole room it's been a credit.

'A pleasure to work with, you can take your hats off. You all take on board ideas.

'People say we couldn't play like that - I've not played in England teams who could keep the ball like that. It might have been because the centre back couldn't use it...

'But it's a f****** credit to you - you can go and you can change people's opinions of what we're about and what we're capable of doing.

'Now you get a chance to have a crack at the big boys. We'll prepare right, we'll make sure the games in between now and then really challenge us and really test us but you've come through two tough games there.

'That (game) could have gone either way couldn't it at half-time. If you hadn't been prepared to pass the ball and press high it could have been a different f****** story.

'They get one and then it's a wobble but you were f****** fantastic, well done - well done everybody.'
