 The Queen’s favourite dog, the Pembrokeshire corgi, is at risk of extinction.

The breed – a favourite of the Royal Family since 1933 – is considered at risk having been placed on the Kennel Club’s most vulnerable breed list.

Breeds make the list if the number of puppies registered with the club dips below 300 a year, as experts consider this an insufficient numbers to ensure its long-term survival.

Last year only 274 Pembrokeshire corgi puppies were registered.

At present the Queen has two corgis, Willow and Holly, and two ‘dorgis’ (a corgi-dachshund cross), named Candy and Vulcan.

She has deliberately scaled down the number as she has got older.

Debbie Richardson, whose Pembrokeshire corgi, Bailey, won Best Dog at Crufts last year, was upset to hear of the breed’s decline. 

Mrs Richardson of Winsford, Cheshire, said: ‘The problem we have is that they are seen as an old person’s dog.

'It would be incredibly sad not to see this quintessentially British breed in our streets and parks in a few generations’ time.’

Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko added: ‘It is worrying to see the breed dip to a historic low and become one of the most vulnerable breeds for the first time ever.’

The Pembrokeshire corgi has been on a ‘watch list’ for some time. 

In 2005 there were 491 puppies registered but by 2010 this had dropped to just 363.

It joins 28 other breeds on the vulnerable list, including the bloodhound, miniature bull terrier and King Charles spaniel.
