The Tory Party was plunged into a farcical leadership crisis yesterday as little-known MP Adam Afriyie was touted as David Cameron’s replacement.

The multi-millionaire MP for Windsor was forced to declare his loyalty to the Prime Minister ‘for now’ as it emerged that an ‘organised’ group of backers has called on MPs to support him as leader if Mr Cameron loses the 2015 general election.

Allies of the mixed race MP – who has drawn comparisons with Barack Obama – have dubbed themselves the ‘Windsor set’, aping Mr Cameron’s ‘Notting Hill set’ of allies.

Insiders said the plans were evidence that Mr Cameron is unpopular with some backbench MPs and a figure ‘untainted’ by serving as a Coalition minister would be needed to replace him.

The Daily Mail can reveal that ‘armed camps’ of MPs are now forming to support future leadership bids by Boris Johnson, Theresa May, backbencher Jesse Norman and George Osborne.

But the secret campaign on behalf of Mr Afriyie, who has not served as a minister, was denounced as ‘loopy’ and ‘deranged’ last night as MPs condemned the plotting against Mr Cameron in the same week that his promise of a referendum on Europe restored Tory fortunes. One senior Conservative said: ‘Oh good. We’re back to being the stupid party.’ 

Several MPs confirmed that friends of Mr Afriyie have been asked to support him as leader – but they stressed that this would only be after 2015.

But with his cover blown, Mr Afriyie took to Sky News to issue qualified support for the PM. ‘Right now we’re 100 per cent behind David Cameron,’ he said, indicating that could change, before pledging: ‘I would never stand against David Cameron.’ 

Mr Afriyie would not need to stand against Mr Cameron because a leadership election is triggered only if 46 Tory MPs demand a vote of no confidence, which would spark Mr Cameron’s resignation were he to lose.

Mr Afriyie added: ‘Of course we talk 
about the long-term future of the party and the long-term success of the
party, because we think it’s the best thing for the British people.’

He claimed the comparisons with Mr Obama were unfounded but pointed out: ‘We share the same birthday.’

MP allies such as Mark Field and Eurosceptic Chris Heaton-Harris are said to be impressed by the way he rose from a single parent home on a council estate to make a fortune put at £100million.

Mr Heaton-Harris was yesterday also 
forced to issue a declaration of loyalty.

‘I want and expect David 
Cameron, who I admire hugely and support as party leader completely, to 
lead the Conservative Party into the next General Election and I also 
fully expect us to win that election,’ he said.

Mr Afriyie, 47, vehemently opposed the creation of the Coalition, calling on Mr Cameron to run a minority administration.

He also assiduously courted fellow Tories by proposing the abolition of expenses watchdog IPSA.

Nadine Dorries, the MP suspended after appearing in I’m A Celebrity, said he had ‘leadership potential’.

Another
backer said: ‘Adam has a fantastic back story. It is difficult to see 
how we get a majority at the next election. The assumption is that David
Cameron will be stepping down.

At
that point we don’t want a coalitionist who has been subject to the 
compromise and taint of government. There are a number of people like 
Adam who are unhappy with the direction of the party.’ 

But
his critics questioned his abilities, pointing out that despite funding
Mr Cameron’s leadership bid he served only briefly in an obscure front 
bench job and has never had a ministerial post.

One
serial rebel said:  ‘If I wanted to get rid of Cameron, the last person
I would back would be the kind of idiots who launch a leadership 
campaign in one of the Prime Minister’s most successful weeks. It’s 
deranged.’

Another MP added: ‘Some people don’t realise how loopy they look to everyone else.’

Mr Afriyie would also have to contend with organised supporters of more senior figures.

Some
senior female MPs will seek to secure the leadership for Mrs May, while
Mr Osborne’s lieutenants have been building support for him on the 
backbenches.

Tory chairman Grant Shapps said he had sought assurances that Mr Afriyie would not run.

Where David Cameron rode to victory with the help of the modernisers in the ‘Notting Hill set’, Adam Afriyie’s team have taken to styling themselves ‘the Windsor set’.

The name is a nod to Mr Afriyie’s seat, where he lives in a lavish former monastery, but is somewhat misleading since the other members are not geographically close.

They include Mark Field, the MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, and Chris Heaton-Harris, the MP for Daventry who has helped co-ordinate European rebellions against Mr Cameron. Another supporter, Nadine Dorries – currently suspended from the Tory whip – is MP for Mid Bedfordshire.

The MPs meet in London, sometimes at Mr Afriyie’s £7.5million mansion near Parliament which he shares with his second wife Tracy-Jane.

One supporter said: ‘It’s like the Notting Hill set. We’re looking at what Cameron and his crowd did before he became leader.’ 

But the Windsor set lacks the heavy hitters who gathered around Mr Cameron, such as George Osborne and Michael Gove.

And most of the Windsor set have been removed from the front bench by Mr Cameron, or were never given a job.

The ‘organised group’ of Afriyie fans claims to number eight MPs, but one critic said: ‘I can’t think of more than five. And most of them are nutters.’

Allies of the largely obscure Mr Afriyie point out that Mr Cameron was little known by the public before – but he and Mr Osborne were widely touted in Westminster as the Blair and Brown of the Tory modernisers for five years before assuming the leadership of their party.
