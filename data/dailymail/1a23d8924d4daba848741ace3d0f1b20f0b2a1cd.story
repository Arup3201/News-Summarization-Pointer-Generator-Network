It's happened again.

Back in 1992 Australia's then prime minister Paul Keating infamously put his left arm around Queen Elizabeth II's back.

The unashamed republican was quickly called 'The Lizard of Oz' as a result and found himself at the centre of a diplomatic storm.

Well now it seems both sides of Australian politics are guilty of prohibited pats on the back.

Armgate: Tony Abbott snapped in an uncharacteristic breach of royal protocol at Parliament House on Thursday

Liberal PM Tony Abbott, more staunchly a monarchist than nearly all his predecessors, was snapped with his arm around the midriff of the Duke of Cambridge at an official engagement in Parliament House, Canberra on Thursday.

The photo was uploaded to the Australian Harper's Bazaar Instagram feed and immediately drew ire from the the online community.

Described as 'a hug' by the magazine, the stray arm was dubbed 'awkward' by one user and 'not appropriate' by another.

Others said: 'What is it with our PMs touching up royalty!' and 'What a creep'.

The photo had been liked more than 400 times by the time it was republished by the Sydney Morning Herald.

The PM was earlier derided by some when he said the Duke and Duchess were 'bigger than (surfing champion) Kelly Slater' after their visit to Manly Beach last week.

Protocol dictates that no commoner should touch a royal, except for a handshake if an arm is first extended to them.

Michelle Obama caused a right royal racket in 2009 when she warmly put her arm around The Queen. In a massive shock, Her Majesty followed suit and hugged the First Lady back.

Australia's second longest-serving prime minister John Howard denies to this day that he placed a hand around The Queen at a reception in 2000, with photos suggesting he came - at least - mightily close.

In October, British fish shop manager Kerry Bickerstaff seemingly guided the sovereign into her Newhaven store with a friendly arm around the waist.
