Cold case: Police suspect they may have found the remains of Doris Anne Wood, 42, who went missing in July 1997 in Delaware

A Kentucky family have discovered human bones inside a storage unit they had purchased at auction, which may be those of a woman missing since 1997.

The remains covered in dirt and stashed inside three plastic bags were found Thursday by a father and son who bought the contents of the storage unit in Corbin at auction after the death earlier this year of the man who had been renting the unit.

A spokesman for the New Castle County police department in Delaware confirmed Friday that authorities there are working with Kentucky officials to determine whether the bones are those of Doris Anne Wood.

The 42-year-old Newark, Delaware, woman was last seen alive in the summer of 1997.

Wood was married to Robert Allen Wood, who once lived in Corbin and died in May at an Alabama hospital at age 59.

The shocking discovery was made at 
around 4pm Thursday as Steven Terry and his father were going through 
the contents of a locker they had purchased for $170 at Pier Mobile 
Storage.

Ghoulish discovery: These human remains covered in dirt were found inside a storage unit in Kentucky

Hiding place: The bones were stashed inside three bags in a unit at Pier Mobile Storage in Corbin, Kentucky

The father and son came across a trio of small yellow grocery bags, inside which they found human bones covered in dirt.

Police say the condition of the remains suggests that they may have been buried at some point, but were later dug up.

The late owner of the locker, Robert Wood, moved from Corbin to Alabama in 2004, but continued paying rent on the storage unit until earlier this year.

The owner of the storage facility called 911 after learning of the startling find, telling the operator that Mr Wood had worked for him around the time his wife went missing.

‘Everybody thought for sure that he had killed her,’ the owner said on the call obtained by the station WTVQ.

Mrs Wood was reported to have left her home in Newark, Delaware, July 28, 1997, to meet with her sister, but she never made it and has not been heard from since.

Her husband was questioned at the time but was never charged in her death, according to the station WKYT.

The bones, which the local coroner has determined to be those of a woman, have been sent to the state medical examiner's office for analysis.
