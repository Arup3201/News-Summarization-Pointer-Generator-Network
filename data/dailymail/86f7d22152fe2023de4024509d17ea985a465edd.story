Marine: Antoine Davis, 30, served as a marine in Iraq according to his ex-wife Tamaira Chesley

A former marine shot and killed his girlfriend before turning the gun on himself after a standoff in an Atlanta suburb with SWAT officers that lasted 12 hours, police say.

Jessica Arrendale, 33, was found dead of a gunshot wound to the head along with Antoine Davis, 30, who police believe shot himself and Arrendale in a murder-suicide.

Police found the couple's five-month-old infant safe inside and rushed her to the hospital to treat her for hypothermia.

Officers arrived at the home in Smyrna in the early morning hours Sunday, responding to a call that there was someone in the home armed with a gun. 

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that police evacuated nearby homes as a precaution and attempted to make contact with the armed man inside.

When officers made the decision to breach the doors around 1:30 p.m., they found the bodies of Arrendale and Davis, both killed by gunshot wounds to the head, Davis's reportedly self-inflicted.

Shot down: Police say they entered the Smyrna townhouse around 1:30 p.m. but by then Jessica Arrendale, 33, was already killed

In addition to the couple's five-month-old, Fox 5 reports that Davis's two daughters from a previous marriage, ages 9 and 10, were in the home.

Their mother, Tamaira Chesley, described how one daughter later told her that Davis stared at her for a 'very long time' before she asked him, 'Daddy, what are you doing?'

Chesley says Davis then went upstairs with a gun and the daughter heard Arrendale screaming and then a 'boom.'

'I'm not sure where his depression came from,' Chesley says, but says there was a custody battle over the five-month-old daughter.

Leslie Tidwell, a friend of Arrendale's, set up a GoFundMe page for her two children, writing on it that 'Jessica was the sole provider for her household.'

Father: Davis's ex-wife Tamaira Chesley described Davis in kind terms, saying that lately he had been struggling with depression and mentioning a custody dispute he had with Arrendale

Lost: A GoFundMe page was set up for Arrendale to provide for her two daughters after her death, saying Arrendale was the sole provider

Arrendale's family did not give a statement, only telling Fox 5 they 'wished to grieve and surround ourselves with loved ones.' 

Davis and Arrendale's five-month-old is currently in custody of the Division of Family and Children Services.
