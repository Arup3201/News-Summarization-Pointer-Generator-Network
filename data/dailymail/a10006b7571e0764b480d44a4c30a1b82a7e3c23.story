Everton have made enquiries for Alessio Cerci of Torino and Wolfsburg's Ivan Perisic.

Italy international winger Cerci is valued at £15m and may be beyond Everton's reach but Wolfsburg are willing to sell Croatia winger Perisic for £8million.

The 
25-year-old is valued at £8million and Everton scouts have watched him 
closely in the Bundesliga and playing for his national side notably 
against Australia in their pre-World Cup warm-up game and Brazil on 
Thursday night.

Money matters: Italy winger Alessio Cerci is an Everton target, although £15m asking price may prove too high

Multi-tasking: Croatia international Ivan Persic can play on the wing, as an attacking midfielder or second striker

Perisic
 only joined Wolfsburg from Dortmund 18 months ago but they are looking 
at strengthening in other areas and will weigh up the strength of any 
Everton bid.

Perisic can play on the wing, as an attacking midfielder or as a second striker.

He is quick, has good technique and gets goals, often spectacular, and is comfortable on the right or left.

Everton also have an interest in QPR's Stephane Mbia, 28, as Gareth Barry is deliberating over their contract offer with West Ham interested in the 33-year-old free agent too.
