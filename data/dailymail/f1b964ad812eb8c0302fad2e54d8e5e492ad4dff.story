Rolf Harris’s daughter sent him an email asking what she would inherit and comparing his £11million fortune to ‘winning the lottery’, his trial heard.

The e-mail was shown to jurors at Southwark Crown Court after Bindi Nicholls took the stand to defend her father, insisting he did not indecently assault an underage girl.

But she said the message, which was released by the judge today after being shown to jurors last week, was being taken out of context - and denied 'helping' her 84-year-old father for any other reason than to tell the truth.

Email: Bindi Nicolls, pictured arriving at Southwark Crown Court last week with her father Rolf Harris, sent him an email asking how much of his '£11million' fortune she would inherit, saying it was like 'winning the lottery'

Evidence: The email sent from Bindi Nicolls. The last line has been distorted in the scanning process but reads: 'Its like being told that you might be winning the lottery at some point and you get excited and dream about'

Emotional: The email said: 'You don't want people being left confused, angry, upset and fraught with sadness'

Bindi Nicholls sent the message in 
July 2012 imploring the veteran entertainer to reveal his financial 
plans and not leave everything to his brother Bruce, now 90.

She wrote of the emotional stress of worrying about whether to spend £2,000 on a holiday because she did not know if she would inherit his estate or not.

'On an emotional note, please imagine 
how it is for me,' the artist wrote. 'I still feel guilty about spending
 any money...and yet figures in millions are being talked about willy 
nilly.

'I stress about 
spending £2,000 on a holiday, or taking a holiday with three of us or 
framing pictures or getting casts made or buying art materials.

Tearful: Bindi Nicholls defended her father, telling the court it was her first chance to tell the truth

'It feels rediculous [sic] in regards to the amount I 'might' be inheriting?

‘It is like being 
told that you will be winning the lottery at some point so you get 
excited and dream about the things that you could do which is quite 
normal, everyone would dream about that.’

In the email Mrs Nicholls and her husband Craig described Harris's fortune as being in the region of £11million.

The email referred to her relationship with Harris' 90-year-old brother Bruce, saying: 'This is important stuff!

'When
 you are gone we are all left with the aftermath of people fighting over
 stuff, I'm left with Bruce and Elaine (and you know how they feel about
 me!) and I'm alone with it all.

'Do you want to write letters to 
people you care about... do you want to give people things before you 
go? How do you want to be remembered?

'Please, you don't want people being left confused, angry, upset and fraught with sadness and grief.'

The e-mail was presented to the jury 
by prosecutor Sasha Wass QC, who pressed Mrs Nicholls on her reasons for
 defending her father in court.

A
 tearful Mrs Nicholls had previously told the trial she became suicidal 
when she discovered her father had an affair with a teenage friend.

But
 crucially, she said, the friend was over the age of 18 when the affair 
took place and the claim that Harris performed oral sex on the friend 
aged 15 was 'laughable'.

Emotional: Ms Nicholls broke down in tears as she gave evidence last week at Southwark Crown Court

Father and daughter: Rolf Harris and Bindi together in 1995. She told the trial: 'I have been having counselling because it's really difficult being the daughter of a famous man and dealing with that on your own is difficult'

The former television presenter denies all the counts

Mrs Nicholls told Miss Wass the letter was being presented out of context.

She
 said: ‘My dad is very vague about money and I would like to feel a bit 
more understanding about what he wants and what mum wants and what I can
 do for them in their old age.’

Pressed
 by the prosecutor on why she had appeared to give evidence, she said: 
‘This isn’t about me helping my father, this is about telling the 
truth.’

She added: ‘I have 
been having counselling because it’s really difficult being the daughter
 of a famous man and dealing with that on your own is really difficult.

‘It’s not just about this. I have dealt with all sorts of things in therapy.’

She
 added: ‘I’m actually telling the truth, that’s what I am doing here. I 
don’ t get very often to be able to say what I feel about anything.

‘This is my time to be able to say what I have had happen to me.’

Mrs Nicholls also denied that she was she was ‘financially dependent’ on her father and said she earned money herself - but admitted he gives her a ‘monthly income’.

The email was shown to jurors last Monday, and was released to the media today after approval by the judge in the trial.

Later the jury heard from character witnesses including former TV star Rosemarie Ford, who said Harris never acted inappropriately.

Former Crimewatch presenter Sue Cook added that Harris should not be accused of lying after he forgot a game show appearance in the 1970s in Cambridge - because she could not recall being in the programme either.

Harris, of Bray, Berkshire, is accused of 12 counts of indecent assault on four women between 1968 and 1986, all of which he denies.

The trial continues.
