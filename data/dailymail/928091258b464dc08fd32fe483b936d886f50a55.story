Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is embroiled in a fierce row with ‘macho’ colleagues who accuse her of giving too much ground to teachers

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is embroiled in a fierce row with ‘macho’ colleagues who accuse her of giving too much ground to teachers.

Close allies of David Cameron say Mrs Morgan, the surprise choice to replace Michael Gove, should take a more aggressive stance and trumpet her predecessor’s radical school reforms more clearly.

One Government source said: ‘I don’t think there’s any question that she’s stumbling. She will have to be told.’

Mrs Morgan’s department has been nicknamed ‘the Department of Nice’ in Whitehall, because of what is perceived as the non-combative nature of the Education Secretary and her junior ministers, the source revealed. 

By contrast, Whitehall has a reputation of being male-dominated and some ministries in particular – such as the Department for Education under Mr Gove – were seen as having an aggressive ‘macho’ culture.

Mrs Morgan has also been dubbed ‘Ms U-turn’ after reversing her opposition to gay marriage, watering down a list of approved punishments teachers can use against errant pupils and launching a consultation on whether teachers are overworked.

Last night Mrs Morgan, 42, hit back at the criticism, saying sniping colleagues had little or no understanding of how toxic their attitude was to Conservative chances in marginal seats such as her own. A source close to the Education Secretary said she made no apology for ending Mr Gove’s ‘war against all’.

Mrs Morgan, who is also minister for women and equalities, believes a more consensual approach stands a better chance of ensuring that Mr Gove’s reforms endure.

‘This would have more force if critics could point to one substantive area where we have retreated,’ the source said of the sniping. 

‘She’s the only Conservative Cabinet minister with a marginal seat and that makes her more attuned than some to what voters do and don’t want to hear. Those urging total ideological purity or aggressive attacks on public sector workers tend to be those with the safest seats.’

The source insisted Mrs Morgan had outclassed ‘vacuous’ Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt since taking on the brief in the summer. Other ministers claim Mr Gove’s new role as Chief Whip allows him to interfere in Mrs Morgan’s work, hampering her ability to carve out her own identity.

‘I think it’s fair to say that Michael retains a very strong interest in what is going on in his former department. I’m sure that doesn’t help matters,’ said one.

A Downing Street spokesman strongly denied that Mr Cameron had been disappointed in her performance. ‘That’s not his view at all, and anyone criticising Nicky does not speak for him,’ he said.

Mrs Morgan won her Loughborough seat with a majority of 3,744 over Labour, and has been identified as one of five members of the Cabinet facing a battle to hold their seats in May’s election.

Pupils are spending more time on core subjects such as science and languages – while so-called ‘Mickey Mouse’ subjects such as media studies are on the decline.

Since 2010, the number of hours teachers are spending on science and history has risen by a quarter, figures show. And the number of children taking GCSE exams in tougher subjects has soared since the election.

The percentage of pupils taking exams at 16 in maths, English, science, a language and either history or geography has gone up by 60 per cent.

Ministers said the figures were a vindication of Tory policies – in particular the introduction of the English Baccalaureate, a performance measure which promotes the subjects employers place most value on.

The figures, contained in a parliamentary answer, show that between 2010 and 2013, the average number of hours spent teaching physics, chemistry, biology and history all rose by about 25 per cent. Languages also benefited, with the number of hours teaching Spanish up by 38 per cent. But the number of hours spent teaching media studies has fallen by 15 per cent.

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan said: ‘Our plan for education is working. Under Labour both academic and vocational subjects had been dumbed down and Britain was stagnating in international league tables. Now, academic standards are back.’
