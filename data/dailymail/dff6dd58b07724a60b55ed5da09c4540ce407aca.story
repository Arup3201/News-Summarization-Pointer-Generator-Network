She's an actress, director, producer, fashionista - oh, and did we mention she's one half of Hollywood’s most iconic and influential couples?

Jada Pinkett-Smith, who is married to Will Smith and is mother to two equally famous children, may be 42 but she's looking better than ever - just take a look at her latest fashion shoot if you don't believe us.

The A-lister has been treated to a high-fashion makeover for Net-a-Porter's The Edit and can be seen posing in an array of figure hugging dresses shot on a balcony in New York by Miranda Kerr's favourite photographer, Chris Colls.

Will Smith is one lucky man! Jada Pinkett Smith, 42, has been given a seriously slick makeover for The Edit's latest edition, within which she opens up about female empowerment and her marriage

Although she displays an enviably toned physique in the new imagery, Jada maintains that she takes a relaxed approach to her fitness.

'I look better than ever and I work out less. I’m never 
in the gym for [more than] 45 minutes,' she said.

'As I’ve gotten older, 
I’ve learned that it’s about being physical every day. You don’t have to
 go to the gym if that’s not your thing. You can go outside your door 
and walk around your block.'

One thing that Jada was keen to open up about in the interview with the magazine was her husband, Will Smith, explaining that their relationship is stronger now than ever, despite the rumours that have persistently dogged their 17-year romance.

Strong bond: Over the years, she and Will have been accused of unfounded infidelities, of having an 'open marriage' and have even had their sexualities questioned, all of which she shrugs off

'Will, to me, encompasses everything. It’s almost as if calling him "my husband" is too small of a word for what he means in my life,' she said.

Married for 17 years, she reveals how their relationship has changed over time. 'We used to have all these rules, [but] as you go on in your relationship, you just get into a flow… I had a very stuck idea of what a husband looks like, what a wife should be.

'Once I broke all of that, a whole new world opened for me and man, oh, man, I got to see him in all his glory. And so that’s what it’s evolved into. And I’m just ecstatic about it.'

Over the years, the couple have been accused of unfounded infidelities, of having an ‘open marriage’ and have even had their sexualities questioned.

Jada shrugs off these rumours, saying: 'The coping technique is knowing what the truth is - there’s no better technique…It’s kind of entertaining. We can laugh because it’s so ridiculous. I don’t take it personally.'

Female empowerment: Jada puts her fame and power to good use - she once visited Washington to testify on sex trafficking and now she's working with CNN on a documentary about it

As well as the state of their own marriage, the Smith’s were at the centre of media scrutiny earlier this year when 13-year-old daughter Willow found herself amidst controversy when an Instagram picture of herself in bed next to topless 20-year-old actor Moises Arias went viral.

The 
42-year-old star insisted there was 'nothing sexual' about the snap, which
 was noticed on one of Kylie Jenner's Tumblr accounts on Tuesday.

Speaking in a video on TMZ,
 she said at the time: 'Here's the deal. There was nothing sexual about that picture
 of that situation. You guys are projecting your trash onto it … and 
you're acting like covert paedophiles and that's not cool.'

Speaking out: Jada says that being a woman in an industry that has a voice made her feel this enormous amount of responsibility to speak out about female empowerment

Aside from her duties as a mother and actress, Jada has always been a huge advocate of female empowerment. In 2012, she visited Washington to 
testify on sex trafficking and now she's working with CNN on a 
documentary on the subject.

'A lot of people want to believe it only 
happens to poor girls, and that’s not true. It’s a people problem,' she says.

'Being a woman in an industry 
that has a voice, I just felt this enormous amount of responsibility to 
at least let other people know. "Guess what guys? It’s not just 
happening over there. It’s happening right here." I just had to get that
 word out.'
