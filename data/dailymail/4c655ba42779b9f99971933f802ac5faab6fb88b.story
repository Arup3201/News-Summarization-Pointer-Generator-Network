Members of the Chelsea squad brought some festive cheer to children at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on Monday as the club continued a long-standing tradition.

Players including John Terry, Diego Costa and Petr Cech surprised young patients as they visited the London hospital to hand out some early Christmas gifts.

The kids were treated to signed photographs and replica shirts and even got the chance to pose with the players for some Christmas snaps.
