In his glory-filled years as a Manchester United player you knew what you were going to get with Rio Ferdinand.

Few central defenders were as comfortable on the ball while the former England captain also knew when to find Row Z.

Ferdinand could read the game a step or two ahead and had an iron will to win.

He's not a Manchester United player anymore though so what, if anything, will have changed as he returns to Old Trafford to face his old employers for the first time.

At 35 he's no spring chicken and with his new boss Harry Redknapp well into the numbers needed for a free bus pass, we thought the pair would be up for a game of bingo - and you can play along too. 

Below is a list of things that could or should happen when Ferdinand goes up against some familiar faces on his old stomping ground, just tick them off as and when they happen.

 1 - Ferdinand applauds both sets of fans

This one's your starter for 10. Away fans always get a clap, during the warm-up and at the end of the game, simply for making a lot of noise. But Rio's remembered fondly at the Theatre of Dreams so expect the home fans to show their appreciation and him to return the favour.

Rio Ferdinand is guaranteed to be doing a fair bit of clapping at Old Trafford this Sunday

2 - All aboard the banter bus I

There will be a moment in this clash where Ferdinand flies into a former team-mate. Rooney could get riled and Fletcher might get fiery. But expect them to pick themselves up, dust themselves down, shake hands and have a laugh about it in a 'why I oughta' sort of way.

3 - All aboard the banter bus II

Tunnel hugs and handshakes will be the order of the day as the teams prepare to walk out at the corner of the pitch. It's not Roy Keane and Patrick Vieira you know. Don't rule out a high-five or two.

Rio Ferdinand and Wayne Rooney will be on different teams in the same tunnel this time at Old Trafford

4 - Long shot

QPR aren't expected to have much to cheer and Rio Ferdinand goals are rarer than hens' teeth. But if he does find himself in the wrong box and manages to ripple the net, he won't celebrate. No, no, no. It's the 11th commandment after all. 'Thou shalt not rub their noses in it.' Or something like that.

5 - Other people's goals are different though

If some other QPR player had to fire one in, well, that's a different matter entirely. And Ferdinand only knows one way to enjoy a goal. Expect him to be pictured head and shoulders above his team-mates, hands resting on a pal's shoulders, screaming at the fans.

We've seen this celebration from Rio Ferdinand many times over the year

Rio Ferdinand had many happy times in the home dressing room at Old Trafford

6 - Easy mistake to make after all these years

Even if Ferdinand does this one for a giggle, it counts. Walking into the wrong dressing room. 

7- Fergie who? Now it's me and you

At some point Ferdinand and Redknapp, the new man(ager) in his life will get together and enjoy that special moment only a boss and his big player can enjoy. A cuddle or a handshake (Harry's not a high-fiver) both count. 

8 - Choon

Big players + big reputations + big salaries = MASSIVE headphones. Look out for Ferdinand getting off the bus with the cans on. And there's a bonus point if it's confirmed he's listening to the Duran Duran classic Rio.

It's unlikely Rio Ferdinand is listening to Duran Duran but you never know

9 - Rio who?

If a United new boy, signed after Ferdinand's departure, steps out of line or on Rio's toes, expect the squaring up but without the happy ending (see No 2).

Rio Ferdinand has never been scared to stand his ground against opponents

10 - You didn't need to get me a card

It won't be one with 'welcome back' written on it. Tick this one off if the ref dishes out a red or yellow to Ferdinand.

With Man United expected to launch wave after wave of attacks, Rio Ferdinand could well pick up a card

11 - All aboard the banter bus III

Mascots love the limelight these days, the furry rascals. If Fred the Red and Ferdinand have anything to do with each other, put a line through No 11.

Fred the Red will be on hand to welcome Rio Ferdinand back to his old stomping ground

12 -  You never know...

If Ferdinand keeps out Falcao, Rooney, Van Persie and Co it really will be the game of his life. He picks up the champagne for Man of the Match, after a 1-0 QPR win in which he scored with a bullet header, and announces he's available for England again.

Rio Ferdinand won 81 caps for England before retiring from international football
