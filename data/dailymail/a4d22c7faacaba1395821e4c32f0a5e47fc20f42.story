Senior Lib Dems today slapped down Vince Cable for claiming the coalition could break up before the 2015 election.

Treasury minister Danny Alexander dismissed his Cabinet colleague's suggestion that it is ‘a possibility’ that
the power sharing deal with the Tories will collapse before 2015.

Business Secretary Mr Cable stunned colleagues by also indicating 
that he has private ‘red lines’ that would prompt him to walk out of the
Cabinet.

Row: Relations have soured between Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander and Vince Cable in recent weeks as divisions emerged over the economy

The Lib Dem conference in Glasgow has been dominated by the increasingly erratic behaviour of Mr Cable, attacking Tory coalition partners and distancing himself from the government's economic recovery.

Senior allies of Nick Clegg have grown irritated by what they see as disloyalty which risks undermining the key messages the party has on fairness and economic competence.

The veteran minister also faced Tory 
anger last night after dismissing his Conservative colleagues as 
‘nasty’, ‘callous’ and ‘ugly’ opportunists.

Asked
at a fringe meeting at the Lib Dem conference whether anything would 
ever compel him to quit the Coalition, Mr Cable made clear he has 
privately considered quitting the Government.

‘I
think President Obama has just proven very eloquently in recent weeks 
the dangers of parading your red lines in public,’ he said. ‘I am not going to do an Obama.’

Asked
whether the Government might collapse, Mr Cable said: ‘It’s certainly 
possible. We are not at the stage of talking about that process. It is 
obviously a highly sensitive one.’

But Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and a key ally to Mr Clegg, rubbished the idea the coalition would break-up.

He told Sky News: 'This coalition will continue until the end of this Parliament, as we promised.

'We have a very big job to do to clean up the economic mess that Labour left behind and to entrench the recovery that we are starting to see.

'To make sure that we create the jobs in this country that need to be created, that we deliver the big tax cuts for millions of working people that we promised, that we continue the process of sorting out the financial system.'

Mr Alexander added: 'We are not going to walk away from that job months or years before the end of the coalition Government.'

Baroness Grender, former head of communications for the Lib Dems, said she also believes the coalition will last until the next general election.

Allies of Mr Cable have privately 
suggested that if there is a hung Parliament, he could become Chancellor
in a coalition with Labour and oust Mr Clegg as Lib Dem leader – a move
they call ‘Plan V’.

In an 
overture to Labour, Mr Cable said it was his ‘working assumption’ that 
the Lib Dems should pick a future coalition partner based on the number 
of seats, rather than votes, that they win – a formula that favours 
Labour since the electoral system gives it an advantage.

In his main speech to the conference in Glasgow, Mr Cable, a former member of the Labour Party, said Labour had ‘fallen asleep at the wheel’ in the run up to the financial crash.

But he then launched an intemperate attack on the Conservatives, making clear that he holds them in contempt.

Mr Cable said: ‘The Tories’ friends and donors were at the heart of the greed and recklessness which lay behind that disaster.’

Mr Cable directly contradicted Nick Clegg who has said the Coalition will survive until polling day

He accused the Conservatives of ‘callous’ behaviour towards immigrants, unions and benefit claimants and attacked the Tories’ election strategist Lynton Crosby, whom he labelled ‘an Australian Rottweiler’.

Branding the Conservatives the ‘Tea Party Tories’, Mr Cable criticised what he called their ‘blinkered, small-state ideology’.

He said: ‘Theresa May once characterised the Tories as the nasty party. After a few years of trying to be nice and inclusive it has reverted to type.

‘The list of people the Tories disapprove of is even longer than that. Public sector workers, the unmarried, people who don’t own property. We must not allow them to turn the clock back.’ 

He added: ‘That is not our kind of politics. It is ugly.’

Mr Cable even warned that Tory allies could spark a new financial collapse.

He dismissed David Cameron’s depiction of him as Jeremiah – the Old Testament prophet of doom – saying ‘Jeremiah was right’ that ‘Jerusalem would be overrun by the armies of Nebuchadnezzar’.

Mr Cable claimed: ‘Gordon Brown’s new Jerusalem was overcome by an army of estate agents, property speculators and bankers. 

‘The problem we now have is the invaders are back and they have a bridgehead in London and the south-east of England, and they have got to be stopped.’ 

The Business Secretary’s outburst appalled even his own colleagues and was met with only muted applause from party members.

One fellow Lib Dem minister dismissed his speech as ‘just awful’. Another said: ‘To say that I was unimpressed would be an understatement.’

Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘If Vince Cable dislikes his own government so much the honourable thing to do would be to leave it.’ 

His colleague Stewart Jackson branded Mr Cable ‘infantile’ and called for him to resign.

He said: ‘I’m more than happy for Vince Cable to be in opposition to his own Government. Just give up salary, red boxes and the flunkies first.

‘Lib Dems forget that without the Conservative Party they’d still be a knit your own tofu pressure group rather than a responsible party of government.’
