Marijuana has been legalized in Washington D.C., Oregon and Alaska as a series of sidelined pro-cannabis referendums were ushered in during the midterm elections.

The legalization has provided a new high for the marijuana lobby, two years after Colorado and Washington led the way in approving cannabis for recreational use.

On marijuana, Washington, D.C. approved the measure by 65 percent in favor and 28 percent against, while Oregon passed by 54 percent to 46 percent. In Alaska, the vote was passed with a 52 percent majority.

 Mike Elliot, head of the Colorado-based Marijuana Industry Group, said: 'More and more people are realizing that it makes sense to choose licensed, regulated, and taxed marijuana businesses over the drug cartels.'

On the streets of the US capital, pro-marijuana campaigners were in jubilant form.

The result in Washington D.C. became not just a practical victory for its campaigners, but also a symbolic one.

Malik Burnett, a leading pro-cannabis campaigner, said: 'This is a great day for ending the war on drugs in the District of Columbia.'

He told the Washington Post: 'This is huge. We’re talking about ending the prohibition of marijuana as a manifestation of the war on drugs, in the birthplace of the war on drugs: Washington, D.C.

'The District of Columbia was the birth place of the war on drugs, and marijuana prohibition was the engine of the war on drugs. Today we are putting the engine out of commission.' 

However, Florida appeared to have failed to approve a measure allowing marijuana for medical purposes.

Some 57 percent voted in favor, less than the 60 percent required for the proposal to pass, partial results showed.

Following Colorado and Washington's lead two years ago, the shift in policy could inspire other states to take similar action during the next election, and eventually, lead to loosened marijuana laws across the country.

And while marijuana is nowhere to be found on the ballot in California, a medical marijuana dispensary in Sacramento, River City Phoenix, was offering a free gram of weed to members of the public who vote on Tuesday.

Speaking with KCRA, manager Shayna Schonauer said, 'If people go out and they vote and they bring in their "I Voted" sticker, we're going to give them a complimentary gram on the house.'

At least a dozen people had taken the dispensary up on their offer by midday.

Opponents worry that the government won't truly be able to regulate the marijuana industry to make sure sellers are distributing safe to use product. They're also concerned that it will lead to greater numbers of car accidents as high drivers take to the roads.

The Portland Mercury, a local paper, has pointed to Washington and Colorado as evidence that the argument is bogus. Neither states have seen an increased in roadway accidents since legalizing pot two years ago, it said.

The New York Times and the state's most influential newspaper, The Oregonian, have both come out in favor of marijuana legalization in the state. 

Alaska's vote will change the law to allow people over the age of 21 to maintain six pot plants and poses a single ounce of dope.

According to language contained in the measure, the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board would implement the bill, but the state legislature would be required to develop a Marijuana Control Board to take over regulation of pot sales permanently.

A key argument against decriminalization in Alaska is that it would reportedly cost the state government $7 million per year to regulate.

Meanwhile, residents in Washington, D.C. will be allowed to possess six pot plants and two ounces of weed.

The D.C. ballot initiative would not provide any other regulatory guideline for recreational pot use however, such as government oversight and taxes.

However, Congress, which has superseding authority over the District of Columbia, may strike it down.

Likewise, even though ballot measures in Oregon and Alaska have received voters' approval, federal law still categorizes the possession, sale and distribution of dope a crime.

The Drug Policy Alliance, the main group pushing for the Oregon ballot initiative, is working world wide to get pot-friendly laws passed. Already, they are working to get pro-pot bills on the ballot in several states ahead of the 2016 elections, which reportedly include California, Arizona, Massachusetts and Nevada.

'If we lose in Oregon, it will shift the national frame a little bit,' Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the group, had previously told NBC. 

'But it doesn’t change the strategy and it doesn’t change the tactics,' he said. 'A generation from now people will still step back and look at the prohibition of marijuana and say, what the heck was that about?'

Oregon voters decided for the third time today whether to legalize the recreational use of marijuana and the businesses that support it

Likewise, Mason Tvert, communications director of the Washington, D.C. based Marijuana Policy Project, another leader in the legalization movement and a major funder of the Alaska initiative, said today's outcome would have little effect on the future of decriminalization.

Tvert's group alone put $700,000 into the Alaska measure. It would like to see restrictions on weed that are similar to those on alcohol.

State and local ballot initiatives, such as those which have introduced the pro-marijuana legislation, are often overlooked in the frenzy for the U.S. Senate.

The Rocky Mountain state in 2012 became the first state, along with Washington, to give the thumbs up to recreational marijuana use after a pro-pot ballot initiative was approved by voters.

This year Coloradoans are being asked to consider a measure that would give unborn babies the same legal rights as babies out of the womb.

The initiative would amend the Colorado constitution to redefine person and child in the state's wrongful death act to 'include unborn human beings.'

The suggested law change is in response to the death of an unborn baby named 'Brady' who was killed by a drunk driver in his mother's eight month of pregnancy. Current Colorado law does considers an unborn child part of its mother's body, and so the driver was not charged with homicide.

Opponents of the law, which include Planned Parenthood, say the language change could lead to the criminalization of abortion.

In the end, a resounding majority of the voters declined. Proponents of Amendment 67 on Tuesday. 

Marijuana was just one subject being voted on, along with everything from abortion to gay marriage and GMOs to bear-baiting, in state and local referendums held in the sidelines of the US midterm elections.

Same-sex marriage, which is also in the process of being legalized by many US states, was put to a referendum in Arizona, which amended its constitution to outlaw it five years ago.

Another hot button issue, abortion, was on the ballot in Colorado, North Dakota and Tennessee.

In Colorado a proposal to define a fetus as a person was rejected by 64 percent to 36 percent of voters. In North Dakota pro-abortion voters also won by 64 percent to 36 percent.

Firearms measures were voted on in Alabama, Missouri and Washington state, where there were two opposing ballots: one making it tougher to buy a gun by imposing background checks, and the other seeking to ban exactly that measure.

Eight towns and cities voted on anti-fracking proposals. The extraction of oil and gas from shale via hydraulic fracturing has boosted US oil production, but critics fear its impact on the environment.

Several towns and cities voted on measures against genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Referendums in Oregon and Colorado sought to make it mandatory to label food containing GMOs.

On a lighter note, in California a measure proposed in San Francisco and Berkeley would impose a tax of one cent per centiliter on sugary beverages, in a bid to combat obesity and other health problems.

Voters in Alaska were consulted on a proposal to ban mining activity if it endangers wild salmon.

Also aiming to protect animals, the East Coast state of Maine was asked to ban the use of food to bait bears, in particular using cold pizza and donuts as lures.
