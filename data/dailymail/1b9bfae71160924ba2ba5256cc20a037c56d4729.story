When he won the £148million jackpot, his wife admitted she craved a £60,000 Audi Q7. It was a modest ambition for their new car - but it turns out the couple have decided to shell out even less.

Music shop owner Adrian Bayford, 41, of Haverhill, Suffolk, who won the staggering jackpot with his wife Gillian, 40, in August, has spent just £17,000 of his vast fortune on a white 4x4 Ford Kuga.

Their winnings could have bought them almost 9,000 Kugas, but it is another sign of the Bayfords continuing their down-to-earth approach after they became the 516th richest people in Britain.

The lucky couple revealed in August that they celebrated the life-changing win with their children Cameron, four, and Aimee, six, by buying a takeaway from the local branch of Domino’s Pizza.

Soon after their win was revealed they shunned exotic destinations and luxury pampering at hotels in favour of a caravan holiday with Gillian’s parents in Scotland, flying there on an easyJet plane.

The couple’s cautious approach has won admirers across the country - and the new car is another piece of evidence of the couple’s careful spending, which caught the eye of locals in their home town.

One local resident, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It’s a really nice car, very new and shiny, but not what you expect a multi-millionaire to own. It’s a 61-plate so you can see it’s new.’

They could have bought the world’s most 
expensive car almost seven times - a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO made for race driver 
Stirling Moss that sold privately in June for 
$35million (£21.7million).

The couple scooped the second largest lottery jackpot in British history in August with a ticket Mr Bayford bought at his local newsagent.

According to The Sunday Times Rich List, the Bayfords now have a fortune to rival Jamie and Jools Oliver (£150million), Sir Tom Jones (£140million) and Eric Clapton (£130million).

Despite their millions, loyal Mr Bayford was spotted back at his musical instrument shop in Haverhill, Suffolk Music Centre, where he vowed to keep working alongside business partner Richard Huspith.

Mrs Bayford, who has worked in ward D2 at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge for three years, said she intended to leave the job to spend more time with her family.
