America's 'most hated' airline has cheerfully released a report revealing what passengers despise most about their service, following a request for them to unleash their fury via social media.

In July, Spirit Airlines announced that it would give 8,000 air miles to any traveller who vented their anger about poor flying experiences on its or other airlines.

It has been inundated with more than 28,000 complaints, according the report, which they have named the 'State of the Hate'.

Worst offender: Spirit has received the most complaints of any airlines for the past five years

'Airline hate is at an all-time high,' the airline says on its website. 'Airlines mess up - we're willing to admit it, and we're working to get better.' 

It's not just Spirit Airlines passengers are moaning about. Following the announcement of the 'Hate Miles' campaign over the summer, 60 per cent of the grievances on social media have been directed at other airlines.

The airline's President and CEO Ben Baldanza expressed his surprise over the findings in a statement. 

'I think if any organisation asks for feedback you would expect the vast majority of responses would be directed at the company that seeks it, but in this case we were surprised that most consumers chose to share their frustrations about other airlines,' he said.

Seating - 20%

Lost bags - 16%

Delays - 15%

Service - 15%

Fees - 12%

Cost - 7%

Legroom - 7%

Food and drink - 5%

Boarding - 2%

Cancelled flights - 1%

Spirit - 40%

Delta - 12%

United - 10%

American - 8%

Southwest - 7%

US Airways - 5%

Jetblue - 3%

Frontier - 2%

Airtran - 2%

Other - 10%

Spirit was still far the worst offender, accounting for 40 per cent of online backlash, followed by Delta (12 per cent) and United Airlines (10 per cent).

Uncomfortable seating was the motivation behind 20 per cent of the online criticisms. Lost bags was another common grievance (16 per cent), followed by delays and service (both 15 per cent).

Spirit was surprised to learn that they were only the worst offenders for one of these grievances: Extra fees. 

Its answer? 'Some people call the, fees. We think of them as options. Other airlines bundle them into your fare. But when you fly with us, you pay only for what you use.'

The budget airline hopes customers can learn to love their 'no frills' approach. 'We need to continue educating our customers about our business model,' said Baldanza.

'Our experience shows once customers understand how much money they save with our model, they like it a lot.'

Spirit Airlines made headlines earlier in the year when the 'Hate Miles' campaign was launched, in response to receiving more complaints than any other airlines five years in a row. 

In return for venting their anger about a bad experience on board Spirit or one of their competitors, passengers were rewarded with 8,000 free air miles.

As ever, there’s a catch – with passengers needing 10,000 total miles to secure a free flight, or flyers can sign up for the airline’s credit card to be able to book 2,500-mile one-way fares. 

In April, MailOnline Travel reported every year from 2009-2013, passengers were three times as likely to have an issue with Spirit than they were the second-place airline.

The figures were calculated based on complaints - from flights and fares, to baggage and refunds – per 100,000 passengers.

In fact, Spirit received so many complaints, according to the the US Public Interest Research Group Education Fund report, it had to be excluded from deeper analysis of on-time performance, baggage mishandling, and other issues.

The airline also has its own ‘boycott Spirit’ Facebook page, and a Twitter handle called @hatespiritair.

The report, which analysed consumer complaints filed with the Department of Transportation, said of Spirit: 'Two checked bags, basic meals and snacks, carry-ons, and, often, in-flight entertainment were formerly included in the price of your ticket, but now add-on fees for each of these newly a la carte items can easily add $100 or more to the cost of a one-way ticket.’
