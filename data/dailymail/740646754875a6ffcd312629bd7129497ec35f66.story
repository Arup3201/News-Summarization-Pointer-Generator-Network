A fake bank which had its own premises and employed uniformed clerks, swindled Chinese savers out of £21million.

The bank in the eastern city of Nanjing interior looked like any other  state-owned bank and over 200 people deposited their money there, including a businessman who handed over £1.3m last year.

The businessman was said to have grown suspicious when he wasn't paid the interest he was promised.

A fake bank which had its own premises and employed uniformed clerks, swindled Chinese savers out of £21million; the bank had over 200 customers, including a businessman who deposited £1.3m

According to the Southern Metropolis Daily a police investigation revealed the bank was in fact a rural cooperative with none of the accreditations it needed to operate as a bank.

The fake bank had been promising interest rates of 2 per cent a week and high interest subsidies. 

Police arrested five people, including a woman who was said to have high-tailed it to China's famous gambling centre, Macau, with customers' money. 

The website reports that Chinese social media users are outraged the fake bank took so long to be discovered.

One wrote: 'More than a year, it looks like the authorities have gone blind.
