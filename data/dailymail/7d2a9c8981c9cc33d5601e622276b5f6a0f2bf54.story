A 13-year-old student dressed as the Batman villain Two-Face shot himself dead with a hand gun today at an Oklahoma junior high school, just minutes before classes were due to start.

Horrified students - many of whom were similarly dressed for the school's Super Hero Day - heard a gunshot before 8am and found eighth grader Cade Poulos lying in a hallway, according to classmates speaking to KOCO.

Terrified teenagers then fled the halls, fearing a gunman was on the loose.

According to a Facebook memorial page since created for the Stillwater Junior High student, bullying is a suspected motive for the boy's death.

Killed: Police have identified 13-year-old Cade Poulos as the eighth grade student who allegedly shot himself in the head moments before class

Family: Cade Poulos is pictured right of his sister and brother in a Facebook memorial to the boy that mutually condemns bullying

'We all broke down and cried when we heard the gun shot.
 I hope people realize now that Bullying is NOT acceptable, and it hurts
 people in every way. Little words hurt. We know what you experienced. 
But we all love you, your [sic] in our prayers...' a Facebook post in memorial of Cade read.

Since its creation this morning it has received over 6,000 likes by mid-afternoon.

On Wednesday night, about 120 of Cade's friends and community members packed into the Highland Park Methodist Church for a prayer service, according to the Tulsa World.

The church's senior pastor, Rev Derrek Belase said during the service: 'God created Cade, and God loved him until the very end. This morning, God welcomed him home.'

The junior high school and a nearby elementary school were locked down and classes canceled for the day, authorities said.

Several students told KOCO that Cade had gone to school dressed as the fictional character Harvey Dent, aka Two-Face, for the day of costumes as part of Breast Cancer Awareness week.

Stillwater Police Capt. Randy Dickerson told the News Press that 'the 
hallway was probably full of kids that time of day,' some of whom have come forward describing the scene to local media as immediately evacuated out of fear.

'It doesn't appear that anyone else was in danger or threatened,' he added.

Remembered: Cade is pictured centre of his family according to its timestamp three years ago while school officials say they have no filed reports of him having been bullied

Approximately 750 to 760 students attend
 the junior high school with students in grades eight and nine, 
according to Stillwater Superintendent Ann Caine.

The school sent a statement to 
parents saying there had been a 'single shooting incident' at the school
 and that staff and students – eighth and ninth graders – had been moved
 to a safe location. Parents were told to pick up their children at a 
nearby shopping center.

With Cade allegedly dressed as a popular Batman villain, the scene may have painted a grisly reminder of this summer's shootings at the Aurora, Colorado movie theatre where accused gunman James Holmes shot and killed 12 while dressed as the Joker.

'Everyone
 thought it was a joke at first,' ninth-grader Ashlyn Lundholm told the 
Stillwater NewsPress. 'Then I heard people screaming. Then we went to 
lockdown for 35 to 40 minutes.'

An eighth-grade student told the newspaper he witnessed the shooting.

'I saw him on the ground,' Aaron Veselak said. 'There was blood all around his head.'

Evacuation: Following instructions to evacuate the school immediately after the shooting, Lorenzo and Silvia Cook are seen hugging after meeting up at Cimarron Plaza

Injuries: Police Captain Randy Dickerson, seen at a later press conference, explained the shooting as an isolated incident and no others reported harmed or injured

Feared the worst: A fire-rescue truck is seen parked outside Stillwater Junior High School as first responders arrived to initial fears that a gunman was on the loose

Dickerson told the NewsPress that 'the hallway was probably full of kids that time of day.'

According to KOKO, it was a teacher who immediately responded to the boy.

'Everybody just heard a huge pop…there was just a gasp, everybody all at the 
same time. Then silence for about three seconds and then I looked over to see 
what it was, and I saw a body laying on the ground, with blood everywhere. And I 
just started running,' a student told KOSU.

Dickerson told NewsOK he had not heard bullying as a possibility in the shooting but said it's still early into their investigation.

'There's no documented bullying in the 
school records, but all the kids i've talked to who went to school with 
him said he was bullied and that leads me to believe treated like an 
outcast. His peers would know more than the school records,' one 
Facebook user responded to another questioning the reports of his 
bullying.

Emergency response: Officers stand outside the junior high school just after 8am this morning following the reports of a student killing himself in the hallway

Lock down: The school was put on lock down and classes canceled for the day while police say they believe any further threats to students are over

Motive: An online memorial for the boy claims bullying was behind his death on Wednesday morning, an assertion police say they are still looking into

Superintendent Caine said counselors would be available for students.

'It is with a heavy heart that I inform you of a tragic incident at our (school) this morning,' Caine said in a letter to parents. 'At 7:50 a.m. one of our students died as a result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. All other students and staff are safe.'

Responding to the scene was State Sen. Jim Halligan who witnessed and applauded the students' swift evacuation to Cimarron Plaza.

'It has been emotional to be able to see the reunion of parents and children,' Sen Halligan told KAUT.

Stillwater is located about 70 miles west of Tulsa.
