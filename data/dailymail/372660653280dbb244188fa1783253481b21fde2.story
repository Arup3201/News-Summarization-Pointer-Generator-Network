The Romney family is known for its political aspirations, Mormonism, and property portfolio - and now, interior design.

The youngest Romney son Craig and his wife Mary have created a truly kid-friendly space in their large, airy home.

The couple's four children are kept amply entertained with amazing, outside-the-box design features, including a staircase that's been transformed into a slide, complete with large cushion for a soft landing.

Kid's paradise: This grand staircase is traditional on one side, and a slide on the other

Soft landing: No need to slide down the bannister in the Romney house

Color coded: This book collection grouped by color makes an impact

The living room has a swing, perfect for afternoon playtime or gently rocking a baby to sleep, as seen in a recent tour for Color Issue blog.

A
closet has been turned into a secret passageway for playtime 
adventures, and there's also a craft room for when inspiration hits.

The house's more traditional features are only slightly less fun.

Brightly patterned wallpaper adorns offices, bathrooms and bedrooms.

Growing brood: Craig Romney and his wife Mary have four children, including twins that were born in February 2013 and became the former presidential candidate's 19th and 20th grandchildren

House of fun: The home of the youngest Romney son and his wife is a perfect mix of fun and style

Outside the box: The Romneys have used unconventional ideas in their colorful home

Details: Mary Romney is a woman who is not afraid of a little color

Babies' room: The new twins have lots of space and a soft rug for when they start crawling

Creative: There are plenty of supplies for the Romneys' children to draw with if they're feeling artistic

And where the walls are plain white, the couple has framed their children's colorful artworks.

There's
a teepee complete with cushions for some leisurely alone time (or 
hide-and-seek) and colorful rugs adorn the wooden floorboard.

There are also brightly printed curtains framing windows that let sunlight stream in.

The overarching design principle seems to be the more color, the better. And it works to create a fun, welcoming home.

Function and style: A coatroom gets the colorful treatment with an Eames 'Hang it All' coat rack

At age 32, Craig Romney is the youngest of the governor’s five sons. He, Mary and their children recently moved from New York to San Diego, where he is working in real estate.

All five Romney boys campaigned for their father in his bid for the White House last year, taking part in fundraisers and stump events nationwide.

Craig's role in the enterprise was to take Mitt Romney's message to Latino voters, because he is a fluent Spanish speaker.

The former advertising agency music producer welcomed twin babies with his wife Mary in February this year.

Big family: The family is following in the footsteps of the senior Romneys with four children so far

Decorative: Children's books are displayed rather than hidden away in a bookcase

Family: The house is home to four small children and looks comfortable and fun

Mary Romney reportedly has a 'mommy blog' called Me and My Boys in which she documents the day-to-day goings-on in her household.

She has expressed admiration for her mother-in-law Ann, and hinted that she may have taken some of her interior design cues from her.

'From her I have learned not only to cook, but to shop for heels, to decorate a home. I only hope that one day that my boys respect and love me half as much as my husband and his brothers respect and love their mother,' she said in 2012.

Heart of the home: The kitchen's dark wood floors are offset by the white cabinets are pale splashbacks

New additions: Mary Romney gave birth to twins earlier this year - a great opportunity for decorating fun

Play space: The dining area opens onto a children's play area complete with puppet show stage and mini dining table and chairs

According to blogger Aarean from the Color Issue, the house is also a big hit with the neighborhood kids.

The youngest Romney son and his wife aren't the only ones with big ideas.

Mitt Romney and his wife Ann have 
received the go-ahead to raze their La Jolla beachfront house and build 
an 11,000-square-foot mansion.

The California Coastal Commission 
voted today to allow the couple to demolish the 3,000-square-foot beach 
house for which they paid $12million in 2008 in order to build the much
larger home.

The La Jolla home, which sits on 0.41 acres, is one of the family’s three homes.

The Romneys' official primary residence is a townhouse outside of Boston. They also own a $10 million vacation home on the shore of Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire.

The couple sold the 6,400-square-foot home in Belmont, Massachusetts where they raised their children, in 2009 for $3.5 million.

In addition, their 9,500-square-foot ski lodge in Deer Valley, Utah, fetched $5.25 million last year.
