One man called in a little help from some friends when proposing to his girlfriend, and these friends just so happened to be her favourite band, McFly.

Ben Beechey, a 28-year-old singer, has a mutual friend with the group and asked them to help him get engaged.

He was able to convince McFly to send a video message to girlfriend Tegan Lywood, 24, who is a big fan of the pop group.

The special message was played as the couple enjoyed a party with friends in their local pub in Braunton, Devon.

The band wished Tegan a Merry Christmas and then singer and guitarist Tom Fletcher said that Ben, who has sung on the Cunard Queen Victoria cruise ship, had something to ask her.

Tom said: 'Hi Tegan. We're McFly and 
your boyfriend informs us that you're a fan and we thought we'd get in 
touch to wish you a Merry Christmas.

'Merry
Christmas and a happy New Year. Actually your boyfriend Ben might have 
something he wants to say to you so it's over to you Ben.'

Ben immediately proposed and Tegan said 'yes' and the couple, who have been together nine months, will tie the knot in summer 2014.

Ben said: 'Tegan is completely mad about McFly. She has followed them everywhere over the years.

'I
don't think she thought I would ever have got that done. It is very 
rare that they do things like that. It was just a little added thing to 
make it more special for her.'

Tegan, who works at women's clothes store, said: 'I was thrown completely off guard.

'The voices came on the screen and I thought "I recognise those voices". It was so good of the boys to do it.

'All our friends and family loved it. I could not believe everyone got involved. They just found it hard to keep a secret.
