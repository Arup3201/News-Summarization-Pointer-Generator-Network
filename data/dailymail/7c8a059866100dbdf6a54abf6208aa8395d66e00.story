Japan are set to play Palestine on January 12 and then have matches against Iraq and Jordan.

Yoshida has played an important role under Saints boss Ronald Koeman this season, making 11 Premier League appearances and scoring once against Everton.

The former VVV-Venlo defender came off the bench during Southampton's 2-0 win against Arsenal on New Year's Day, a result which kept them fourth in the Premier League table.
