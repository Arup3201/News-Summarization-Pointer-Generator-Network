Cancer patients are suffering a rise in discrimination at work, says new research.

Shocking evidence shows four in 10 people returning to their jobs after treatment have been unfairly treated - a 50 per cent rise in three years.

Patients are being denied time off for medical appointments, passed over for promotion or feeling abused by their employer or colleagues.

Despite the recent introduction of the Equality Act which should protect workers with cancer, some felt so harassed they quit their jobs, claims the charity Macmillan Cancer Support.

It commissioned a YouGov of UK adults who returned to work after cancer treatment which found around one in 10 could not continue in their job as a result of discrimination.

One in eight said their employer failed to make reasonable changes to enable them to do their job.

The survey of 168 adults found 37 per cent of people returning to work after cancer treatment experienced some kind of discrimination from their employer or colleagues.

This figure jumped from 23 per cent in 2010.

The poor practices included hassle over time off for treatment, failing to be considered for promotion and being given unfair workloads by bosses or work colleagues.

Over 100,000 people of working age are diagnosed with cancer each year in the UK Almost half of those who are working when diagnosed with cancer have to make changes to their working lives after cancer, with around four in ten changing jobs or leaving work altogether.

Macmillan Cancer Support said employers must reform their attitudes as an ageing workforce means growing numbers will be diagnosed before retirement.

Chief executive Ciar√°n Devane said 'Employers are risking prosecution by flouting their legal responsibility to protect people living with cancer from unfair treatment and stigma at work.

'There needs to be far more understanding of cancer and how the effects of treatment may impact on people returning to work.

Going back to work after treatment can be very isolating especially if someone has been off for a while and has lost confidence or contact with colleagues.

'As our population grows and ages, and the retirement age rises, cancer will become an increasingly common issue for employees and their managers.

'It's vital they are equipped to help people with cancer stay in work. It isn't difficult and it is likely to be cheaper and easier than recruiting a replacement or defending a discrimination claim.'

Paul Ware, 46, from London, was diagnosed with a blood cancer in 2010, said 'When I told my employer that I'd been diagnosed with cancer and asked to have some time off for treatment, I was given the sack.

'They said they couldn't employ someone who was not a hundred per cent committed. It was a shock as I had a very successful career, and a fulfilling life.

'I took them to an employment tribunal through a solicitor. But it was costing so much I had no money left to fight for my legal rights.

'I was paid a financial settlement. It wasn't a lot, and it's gone just trying to keep the bills paid. It's been a most soul destroying experience and I have never felt more alone than now, trying to regain my place in society with a new job.'

Macmillan Cancer Support is calling for employers to fulfil their obligations to people returning to work after cancer treatment under the Equality Act 2010.

These could include making reasonable changes to their work environment or hours and ensuring they have a back to work plan.

The charity is also calling on the Government to address the lack of specialist back-to-work services for cancer patients in the UK such as counselling, physiotherapy and occupational therapy.
