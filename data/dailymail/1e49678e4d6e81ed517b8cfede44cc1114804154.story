The Duchess of Cornwall will today issue an impassioned plea to the nation to support credit unions as an alternative to the payday loan industry.

Camilla, who herself uses a local banking co-operative, is expected to tell industry leaders: ‘Credit unions can change the way we talk and think about savings and loans.

‘They can encourage those who have the means to save and bring in from the cold those vulnerable people who struggle to qualify for loans.

‘The simple fact being that if more of us support them by opening savings accounts, they will be able to offer more loans to those who really need them.’

A credit union is a regulated co-operative, whose members can borrow from pooled deposits at low interest rates.

The UK has more than 520, boasting more than a million members and managing £1billion of assets.

Because there are no shareholders and they are not driven by profit, credit unions can offer very low interest rates – on average 12 per cent a year – for those seeking loans to tide them over in financial difficulties.

This compares with payday lenders such as Wonga, the country’s largest, which has charged a staggering 5,853 per cent in annual interest. 

MPs, debt campaigners and the Archbishop of Canterbury, who is involved in setting up the Church of England’s own credit union, have all joined the growing clamour of critics branding short-term lenders ‘legal loan sharks’.

As a member of the Royal Family, Camilla does not want to be seen as passing comment on payday lenders but is instead keen to tell people about the credit union movement.

A spokesman for the Duchess said: ‘The Duchess wants to raise awareness of credit unions, which do not have an established national profile, nor do people understand what they are and what they do. 

'Credit unions are regulated financial institutions. They are based within the community and are not for profit.

‘Her Royal Highness believes credit unions do a valuable job in their local communities and wants more people to know about them. 

'She felt that International Credit Union Day was a good time to raise awareness about the good work they do.’

Indeed, Camilla has put her money where her mouth is. In January 2013 she opened up a personal savings account with the London Mutual Credit Union.

It is understood the royal was ‘inspired’ by the work the mutual does. It is believed she uses her savings account to support local community projects.

The Duchess has drawn together at Clarence House a high-profile gathering of representatives from business, banking and politics, as well as credit union members and volunteers, to mark International Credit Union Day. In particular, the group wants to find ways to encourage more savers to get involved.

Although some of the small credit unions are not able to offer a return on investments, many offer interest or dividends of up to 1.75 per cent, which is healthy compared to the high street.

Marlene Sheils CEO of Capital Credit Union in Edinburgh said: ‘This is about people coming together and pooling their savings together. From that pool of savings we are able to lend to each other.

‘We are not a poor persons’ bank. We just need everybody in the community to become involved. Joining a credit union gives you a good deal but helps people as well.’

Payday lenders such as Wonga have been criticised for repeatedly lending money to people who can not afford to pay it back, further spiralling them into debt. 

The firm’s reputation was damaged further this summer when it was revealed to have been charging customers for letters from fake legal firms to pressurise them into paying up.

Earlier this month Wonga agreed to write off the debts – thought to total £220million – of 330,000 customers who are in arrears of 30 days or more. 

This was a direct consequence of discussions with watchdogs at the Financial Conduct Authority. 

Chief executive of Citizens Advice, Gillian Guy, said: ‘Payday lenders have engaged in poisonous practices for years.

‘The payday loan market has pushed people into debt by repeatedly concealing the true cost of loans and failing to check if borrowers can repay. 

'In only a quarter of the payday loan cases reported to us did the borrower think their payday lender had treated them sympathetically.’

Wonga has been criticised for repeatedly lending money to people who cannot afford to pay it back, which leaves them spiralling into more debt. Earlier this month the company had to write of £220million in debts
