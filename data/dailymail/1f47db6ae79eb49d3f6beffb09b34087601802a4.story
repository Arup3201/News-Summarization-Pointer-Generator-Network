The United States may deploy ground troops to fight ISIS in order to prevent the terror group from capturing the Iraqi capital Baghdad. 

Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Martin Dempsey he does not envisage the use of large numbers of combat troops in Iraq, in the operation which has now been named 'Inherent Resolve'. 

This comes as ISIS has moved through the Anbar Province and is threatening the outskirts of Baghdad.

General Dempsey told CNN that it was unlikely that ISIS could seize control of the Iraqi capital. 

He said: 'I'm confident we can assist the Iraqis to keep Baghdad from falling.'

General Dempsey argued that the Iraqi army required more training after it emerged, some of them fled when approached by ISIS. 

He described Iraqi defences around the captial as 'fairly formidable'. 

The United States currently has 12 teams of military advisers in the country. He claimed that 'war is discovery' and admitted he may recommend the use of US ground troops to President Barack Obama if the situation necessitates it. 

General Dempsey told CNN that the US has received 'significant commitment' from other members of the international community. 

He admitted that US led airstrikes alone will not defeat ISIS, whom he described as a 'national security threat'. 

He said that the anti-ISIS mission has now been named 'Inherent Resolve'.

He said: '"Inherent Resolve" is intended to reflect the unwavering resolve and deep commitment of the U.S. and partner nations in the region and around the globe to eliminate the terrorist group ISIL and the threat they pose to Iraq, the region and the wider international community,' 

He admitted that the Iraqi government itself is partly responsible for the growth of ISIS and said that much of the effort in training local security forces has been wasted. 

He said: 'The coaching, and teaching, and mentoring, the thousands of interactions at the local level were all wasted by the government of Iraq that chose deliberately to follow a sectarian agenda and alienate entire segments of the population, which created an environment in which ISIL could return and could flourish.'

General Dempsey said he had been surprised by the poor state of the Iraqi army. 

He added: 'I think what we all probably missed was the degree to which the Iraqi armed forces had eroded and wouldn't stand and face ISIL. I think we all missed that.'

OPERATION INHERENT RESOLVE 

The codename given to the latest Middle East campaign launched by the United States targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. 

Inherent Resolve features a limited air campaign across Iraq and Syria to degrade the fighting capacity of ISIS. At present there are no acknowledged US troops on the ground 

OPERATION DESERT SHIELD

President George H.W. Bush launched Operation Desert Shield after Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. 

Desert Shield was designed to prevent Iraq from threatening Saudi Arabia, while allowing time for a massive buildup of troops in the Middle East. 

OPERATION DESERT STORM

When the decision was made to remove Iraq from Kuwait, the international coalition, led by the United States launched Desert Storm in early 1991.

OPERATION DESERT FOX

Launched in December 1998, Operation Desert Fox was a brief air campaign against Saddam Hussein's weapons installations after the dictator refused to allow UN inspectors to view the  sites. 

OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM

US forces begin a bombing campaign in Afghanistan in October 2001 following the 9/11 terror attacks. 

The initial bombing campaign escalated into an operation which involved at its height 140,000 US and coalition troops on the ground. 

In June 2013, Afghan security forces took over combat operations on the ground although US support troops are scheduled to remain in the country past the December 2014 deadline for withdrawal.  

OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM

In March 2003 President George W Bush decided to topple Saddam Hussein with an overwhelming air and ground campaign. 

Despite routing the Iraqi army and removing the dictator, the resulting power vacuum was responsible for the ongoing civil war in Iraq.
