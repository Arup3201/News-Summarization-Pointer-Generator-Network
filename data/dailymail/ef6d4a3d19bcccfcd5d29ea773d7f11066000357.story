Dougie Freedman’s tenure as Nottingham Forest manager started on a positive note as goals from Danny Collins, Henri Lansbury and Ben Osborn pushed Brighton deeper into relegation trouble.

The hosts had led through Lewis Dunk’s opener shortly before half-time, only for Collins to head Forest level almost immediately.

Having struggled to impose themselves for long spells, Forest slowly grew in confidence after the break with Lansbury’s free-kick and Osborn’s late third putting them firmly in control.

But they had to endure a nervy finale when Brighton debutant Beram Kayal headed late on and Jamaal Lascelles headed another Kayal chance off the line and onto the bar in stoppage time to preserve the points.

Freedman, who left his last job at Bolton by mutual consent at the start of October following a lousy start to the season, was brought in to replace Stuart Pearce in the aftermath of last weekend’s 1-0 home loss to Millwall.

He quickly ripped apart an under-performing team that had slumped dramatically from league leaders at the start of the campaign. Five changes were made from Millwall, incoming were Karl Darlow, Eric Lichaj, Danny Collins, Gary Gardner and Michail Antonio.

Chris Hughton, whose Seagulls side started the afternoon two points above the drop zone, replaced Jake Forster-Caskey with Liverpool loanee Joao Teixeira and Sam Baldock with Solly March after last weekend’s miserable loss at Blackpool.

Freedman, wearing a club-branded jacket and tracksuit bottoms, never sat down during the entire match, standing sentinel on the edge of his technical area and frequently bellowing instructions.

With just a few days available on the training ground, defending set-pieces was one area clearly not yet refined. Twice early on, Brighton players were afforded too much space inside the penalty area but twice Forest survived.

First, Gordon Greer headed across the goal and off target after rising completely unchecked to meet a Danny Holla corner.

Then, on the quarter-hour, more slack marking from a Holla delivery allowed Dunk to leap at the back post and Darlow had to claw it to safety at point-blank range. 

Brighton looked much the brighter going forward, with Bruno supporting the attack at every opportunity and Kazenga LuaLua looking lively after he replaced the injured March early on.

Inigo Calderon fired over the bar from just inside the box after Rohan Ince had shifted the ball to him before a Holla free-kick from about 25 yards out cracked the top of the post with Darlow well beaten by its swerve.

The game was screaming out for a goal. In the event, it got two within the space of 120 seconds and both as a result of dubious goalkeeping.

The hosts gained a deserved lead three minutes before the break. Another set-piece wide on the left from Holla caused panic in Forest ranks and, after Darlow came for it and missed completely, Dunk diverted the ball home though it may have brushed Gardner on its way in.

The joy was short-lived. Barely seconds from the restart, Forest won a set-piece of their own about 10 yards in from the touchline on the left.

Osborn swung it in and Collins met the ball with a header that crept in off the inside of the post. David Stockdale had come out, hesitated and was left stranded as Collins made no mistake.

Brighton continued to set the pace at the beginning of the second-half and Darlow spread himself to block Teixeira’s effort following Chris O’Grady’s flick from Joe Bennett’s cross.

It was just after the hour mark when Ince, struggling to keep pace with the burly run of Antonio, brought him down a matter of millimetres outside the box.

This was a situation that spelt trouble and so it proved as Lansbury lashed the ball low through a crowded box and into the bottom corner.

Suddenly the game sprung into life. At one end, Antonio headed over the bar. At the other, the dancing feet of Teixeira worked space for a shot that took a hefty deflection and crashed back off the post.

Forest wrapped up victory five minutes from time when Osborn rolled in from close range after Chris Burke weaved his way between two defenders to tee him up.

But there was still a nail-biting finish for the travelling fans after Kayal headed in a LuaLua corner in the final minute but Forest clung on to ensure Freedman’s perfect start.
