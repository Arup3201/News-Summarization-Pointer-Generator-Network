Forget vitamins and exercise – if you want to stave off mental decline try a Sudoku instead, say scientists.

A review of various studies on how to preserve brainpower found only a mental workout made a difference in later life.

In Britain, around 820,000 people have dementia, most suffering from Alzheimer’s.

Puzzles: The research found only mental training, which featured in three trials, showed benefits in memory every time

Some research has found exercise can cut the risk of dementia, while other studies suggest doing crosswords, playing cards or using a computer.

But patients and doctors may find the conflicting information confusing, said Dr Raza Naqvi of the University of Toronto, Canada, who led the review.

His team looked at 32 trials involving about 25,000 healthy patients aged 65 or older.

For the most part, studies of drugs, hormone therapy, vitamins and supplements ginkgo, omega 3 and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) showed no positive effect.

With physical activity, the evidence for benefits was ‘weak’, said the review in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.

Only mental training, which featured in three trials, showed benefits every time. Dr Naqvi said: ‘In one trial, participants had significantly improved memory during five-year follow-up periods.’

Crossword: Dr Naqvi has called for more research into 'easily accessible tools' to hone mental skills, such as crossword puzzles and Sudoku

In another study, researchers tested people on everyday tasks such as finding a number in a phone book. Those who had done a mental training programme performed better.

Dr Naqvi called for more study of ‘easily accessible tools’ to hone mental skills, such as crossword puzzles and Sudoku.

And he said it was a case of use it or lose it: ‘I still recommend to my patients to remain mentally and cognitively active as long as possible in whatever way is stimulating.’
