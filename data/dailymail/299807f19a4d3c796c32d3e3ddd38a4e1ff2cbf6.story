Kimberley Wallwork would watch her son Oliver scratch his skin until it bled and then cry in pain

Every night Kimberley Wallwork would watch in despair as her son Oliver scratched his skin until it bled and he then cried in pain.

Her little boy had suffered from eczema since he was a year old and his condition meant he barely slept through the night.

'His skin was red raw and he would wake up screaming - he was understandably incredibly grumpy,' says Kimberly, 26.

'This had been happening for two years and as a family, we were at our wit's end. 

'As a mother, I felt helpless and exhausted. It felt like we'd tried everything,' she told MailOnline. 

It was only through sheer chance that she stumbled across a skincare range online called Bioskin Junior, which, to her relief, has cleared up her son's skin almost completely.

For the first time ever, four-year-old Oliver can now swim, sleep through the night - and his parents' life has improved too.

Kimberley is far from alone in experiencing the hell that eczema brings to all members a household.  

One in five children in the UK currently suffer from the skin condition, with eight out of ten cases occurring before a child reaches the age of five. 

And last year, a committee of MPs acknowledged it caused a 'major disruption to family life'.

Now, one of the largest studies ever carried out into the impact of child eczema has revealed the true scale the condition can have on families - and the feelings of helplessness and frustration many parents face.

In the poll of 800 parents, 72 per cent said their children with eczema have troubled sleep and 35 per cent said this affected their behaviour at school.

And 86 per cent admitted to feeling 'helpless and upset' when their child is suffering from an eczema flare up.

A lack of sleep and frustration impacts other parts of life, too. Sixty-seven per cent of parents have suffered disturbed sleep as a result of their children’s eczema and 32 per cent have had to take time off work to deal with the condition. 

Nearly half said the stress and trauma of eczema has caused friction and arguments with their partner.  

However, the condition still remains largely under the radar, with parents struggling to find suitable advice or treatment.  

'Oliver would scratch his skin red raw and wake up screaming every night - he was understandably incredibly grumpy,' says his mother Kimberly, 26. 'As a family, we were at our wit's end'

The range, called Salcura Bioskin Junior, is based on the principles of homeostasis - the self-healing capacity of the skin, which is dependent on the supply of nutrients. 

Other ingredients in the range, such as sea buckthorn, chamomile and lavender, also help to improve the skin's natural healing process, says the product's creator, Dr Martin Schiele.

'For the first time, these ingredients have now been formulated at levels which are gentle enough to be used on children and babies from three months,' he says. 

In a study, 96 per cent of consumers rated their children’s skin as better after using the range.

Sixty per cent of parents believe the current treatments for eczema on offer are not effective and two-thirds consider the advice they get from GPs to be inadequate. 

For Kimberley, the findings rang very true. 'I was always going into work tired, and would often argue with my fiancé as life was so stressful.'

Oliver's eczema,
 which began when he was a year old, started as a small patch on his 
back and then spread rapidly, recalls Kimberley who lives in Bury, 
Lancashire with fiancé Darren and their other child, one-year-old 
Jessica. 

'We went to the GP and were given aqueous cream to apply.

'When
 that didn't work, we tried various other creams, but his skin just got 
worse and worse - especially when we tried steroid creams,' says 
Kimberley, who works as an assistant at Tesco. 

Then one night last year she was online, when an advert popped up on Facebook.

'It said it was looking for patients to complete and survey and try out eczema products, and I thought "why not"?

'A few days later some samples turned up in the post - a body wash, lotions and an outbreak rescue cream.

'The information said they contained ingredients that would help repair the skin through its natural healing process.'

The range, 
called Salcura Bioskin Junior, is based on the principles of homeostasis
 - the self-healing capacity of the skin, which is dependent on the 
supply of nutrients. 

It
 was only through sheer chance that Oliver's mother stumbled across a 
skincare range online which, to her relief, has cleared up her son's 
skin almost completely. For the first time ever, four-year-old Oliver 
can now swim, sleep through the night - and his parents' life has 
improved too

Mrs Wallwork, with fiancée Darren, says Oliver is now a 'happy, lively little boy' who can enjoy life

Other ingredients in the range, such as sea
 buckthorn, chamomile and lavender, also help to improve the skin's 
natural healing process, says the product's creator, Dr Martin Schiele.

'For the 
first time, these ingredients have now been formulated at levels which 
are gentle enough to be used on children and babies from three months,' 
he says. 

In a study, 96 per cent of consumers rated their children’s skin as better after using the range.

Skin diseases such as eczema are the most common reason we go to the GP, according to figures from the British Skin Foundation. 

The
 condition, characterised by dry, itchy red skin, is now estimated to 
affect up to 20 per cent of school children and up to 10 per cent of 
adults.

Experts advise not using aqueous cream for eczema — not even to wash with. 

It’s
 incredibly damaging to skin, especially children’s, because it contains
 sodium lauryl sulphate, which is the harshest possible detergent.

As a consequence, it breaks the skin down, making eczema worse. 

Worryingly, many people are still given it by GPs as a moisturiser as it’s the cheapest option. 

Research has shown that more than half of children who used it suffered an immediate bad reaction, such as stinging. 

It
 is caused by a lack of fat between the skin cells; as a result, water 
is lost from the skin cells — this causes them to shrink, and cracks 
open up between them. 

Allergens, the substances that can trigger an allergic reaction, can then get into the skin, causing inflammation.

The
 problem with leaving the condition untreated is that the longer 
allergens penetrate the skin, the more allergic the immune system 
becomes and the worse.

'Within days, Oliver's skin began to improve and he began sleeping better. I couldn't believe it,' says Kimberley.  

'Within a week he was sleeping through the night and I can honestly say he is now 100 per cent better.

'He is a happy, lively little boy and for the first time, we can do things as as family, such as swimming. 

'Previously, during an outbreak, the chlorine would sting his skin and leave him in tears.

'What I liked was they could all be used daily and didn't have a harsh smell like many of the products we have tried. Oliver just won't go near them. 

'These smell slightly of lavender and help calm him and get him off to sleep. It's wonderful. His favourite product is the spray as he can apply it himself - it's easy to use and soaks in quickly.'

For the first time, a dedicated online support resource for parents of children with eczema has also been launched - www.childeczemahelp.co.uk. 

It includes information on independent research and a forum where parents can share their experiences and advice on child eczema.
