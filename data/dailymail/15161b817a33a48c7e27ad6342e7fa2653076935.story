From faded flags painted on to the side of buildings, to large ones that nearly engulf their proud bearers, the Stars and Stripes has become a regular sight in the U.S.

Photographer Shannon Davis began to document how the flag has become part of the fabric of American life by taking pictures of it around her home town of Buffalo and elsewhere in the U.S.

She first noticed the prevalence of flags when she returned to the U.S. after spending four years in Britain.

'The more I looked, the more I saw that 
people display it every single day in these casual ways, but it almost 
seemed more real, personal and more in touch with what it means to be 
American,' she told CNN.

As she began her Random Acts of Pride project, Ms Davis started to notice Stars and Strips in unexpected places, such as the side of barns, or taped to cash registers.

And the flags were on show every day, not just for holidays such as July 4.

'Don’t they realize they are trying to be patriotic, but they are doing it in kind of a disheveled way?' the photographer said she found herself thinking.

Although people are usually absent in her shots, when they do appear they can often become the focus for the photograph.

On one occasion Ms Davis was taking a photo of a flag outside a house when a neighbor across the street came over to ask what she was doing.

As she explained her project the man told her he always had a flag outside his house, but had taken it down because of the snow. He then rushed to his house to fetch the huge flag.

'It’s ironic. It’s the same flag, but he
wanted to get his flag,' Ms Davis said. 'I just love that. That’s the 
connection that every single person displaying the flag seems to have: 
It is very personal to them.'

The photographer, who was the creative director for the Turner Classic Movies adverts that celebrated old films, added that the placing of the flag often reflected its surroundings.

'There are some joyous, ironic and 
playful moments and others that are subtle, lonely and separated. The 
flag is not always this beacon, shining and looking so proud and 
wonderful. Sometimes, it looks kind of lonely to me, and I wanted to 
capture that loneliness,' she said.

Her project, which can be seen on Visual 64 is not motivated out of a sense of patriotism, instead coming from her desire to document everyday life and overlooked moments.

Ms Davis, who has also directed films, is still adding to the Random Acts of Pride project as she travels the U.S.
