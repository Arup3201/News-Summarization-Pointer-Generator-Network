They say lightning never strikes twice, but try telling that to 61-year-old Melvin Roberts.

The South Carolina man has been struck 10 times - and lives to tell the tale.

'It's like grabbing an electrical cord. You don't feel the burns until it's over with,' heavily-scarred Roberts told ABC News.

'It cooks you 
from the inside out like being in a microwave. And you've got a hurting 
in your bones.'

Survivor: Melvin Roberts from South Carolina has compared being struck by lightning to getting zapped in the microwave

Human lightning conductor: Melvin Roberts said suffers memory loss, headaches, speech problems and has nerve damage in his hands and leg from the repeated lightning strikes

Roberts made headlines in 2011 when a lightning rod struck his watch - the sixth time he was zapped. His wife Martha said he's been hit four times since.

The odds of being struck by lightning in any one year in the US is 1 in 
700,000. The odds of being struck in your lifetime is 1 in 3,000.

A single lightning strike is made up of several 100 million volts.

'When
 it hits you, it's like being hit by a freight train. It knocks you out,
 knocks you down,' the retired heavy equipment operator said.

'You can tell what's around, you just don't have any control
 over your body...

'It's like a big syringe in the sky and 
when it hits you it puts all this different stuff in your body. It turns your insides completely around.'

He said it doesn't immediately hurt because of the shock, but the blisters can be excruciating.

Roberts has scars on his feet and legs and suffers fromÂ memory loss, headaches, speech problems and nerve damage.

Roberts doesn't know what makes him a human lightning conductor.

The current Guinness World Records holder for 'most lightning strikes suvived' is ex-park ranger Roy C. Sullivan who was hit seven times.

He was first hit in 1942 (lost a toe nail), then in 1969 (lost his eyebrows), 1970 (left shoulder seared), 1972 (hair set alight), 1973 (hair set alight and legs seared), 1976 (ankle injured) and 1977 (chest and stomach burns). He died in 1983 by his own hand.
