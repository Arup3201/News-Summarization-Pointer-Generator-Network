Jose Mourinho says Lionel Messi should not be considered the scapegoat after Argentina's World Cup final defeat to Germany.

The Argentina captain had a chance to replicate the achievement of Diego Maradona in 1986 by leading his team to the World Cup trophy, but they fell at the final hurdle as Mario Gotze scored late on for Germany.

When asked if he thought Messi should be a scapegoat for this, Mourinho said: 'Not at all. I think in the first half he had fantastic options.

'I would like to know why Lavezzi 
stayed in the dressing room at half-time,' Mourinho told Yahoo Sports 
World Soccer Live shortly after the final ended at the Maracana.

'Argentina
 had been playing with two lines of four, with Enzo Perez closing 
Phillipp Lahm and Lavezzi doing the same on the other side. Because they
 were so compact Messi could walk while defending and then when he got the ball he had the energy to make the difference.

'When
 Sabella brought Aguero on for Lavezzi, Argentina changed from a 4-4-2 
to a 4-3-3 and they lost a lot of balance. Messi had to run much more 
after Lavezzi went off.

'The team lost balance and especially energy - energy that they needed in extra-time.'

Mourinho said Messi deserves respect 'more than ever' after Argentina came so close to being crowned world champions.

'It's easy to respect him when he has won but when he has lost, it's not so easy,' the Portuguese coach said.

'He
 is still a historical player. He does not need to be world champion to 
be a historical player, especially in this last decade.

'For
 me Pele is Pele and Maradona is Maradona. It's not for me to compare 
players from different generations. Maybe because he is from the same 
generation as when I was born - for me Maradona is Maradona.'

When asked what his favourite moments of the tournament were, the Chelsea boss said: 'I will need to look forward and think about what I will remember in 20 years' time.

'Costa Rica killing as many giants as they did. For a negative reason Luis Suarez's situation with Giorgio Chiellini.

'Obviously the 7-1 Brazil-Germany game will be remembered forever. And obviously Gotze's goal because it gives Germany the cup.
