Prince Harry rounded off his hugely successful week-long tour of the U.S. today very much in his comfort zone – playing polo.

The 28-year-old's team won the match at the exclusive Greenwich Polo Club in aid of Sentebale, the charity he set up to help children in the poverty stricken African kingdom of Lesotho.

And as well as being awarded a trophy for his team's stellar effort, the prince also scored a kiss from model Karolina Kurkova at the end of the fast-moving game.

Cheered on by models, designers and wealthy guests, Harry played in a team captained
by Malcolm Borthwick, a regular in the England team, against a team led by Argentinian player and Ralph 
Lauren model, Nacho Figueras.

Borwick
said Harry would show his true athleticism on the field after having 
tried his hand at baseball in New York City on Tuesday. 'He's an extremely good polo player,' he said.

Also playing on Prince Harry's team was Dawn Jones, wife of the actor Tommy Lee Jones.

The game kicked off after Harry arrived in a 
motorcade dressed in jeans, a blazer and his favorite desert boots. He 
was greeted by club founder Peter Brandt and his model wife, Stephanie 
Seymour.

Brandt,
65, - whose wife is 44 - is an American industrialist and businessman, 
worth an estimated $2.7 billion. He is also a major art collector and 
avid horseman.

Brant said on Wednesday that Harry's 
father and grandfather were good players and he was excited to watch 
Harry play at his club.

'It's a great honor,' he said. 'It's great for polo.'

When he welcomed the prince into his home for a brief art tour ahead of the game, Harry was confronted with a naked sculpture of his host's wife.

The piece, commissioned by Mr Brant from
the artist Maurizio Cattelan, shows a naked woman's torso in the style 
of a ship's figurehead, clutching her breasts. It is entitled Stephanie,
although often known by its nickname of Trophy Wife.

After arriving just after 11.30am, 
the prince was given a tour of the polo club before joining the 
high-profile guests at a meet and greet before the game in an undercover
bar area.

The staff had also set up a marquee bedecked with flowers and tables laid out, appropriately, with royal blue cloths for lunch.

Located
in leafy Connecticut, Greenwich is one of the wealthiest pockets of the
US, filled with hedge fund millionaires and their trophy wives.

Unlike
previous royal polo events, tickets for the Sentebale Royal Salute Polo
Cup, one of the highlights of the international calendar, are not 
available for sale.

Sponsors,
who include Royal Salute whisky, Land Rover, Garrards jewellery and St 
Regis Hotels, have each bought a number of tables to which they invite 
select guests.

The guests included the 13th Duke of 
Argyll, fashionista Olivia Palermo, model Karolina Kurkova and designers
Jason Wu and Valentino.

'Is the sun coming out?' Kurkova asked as she posed in a light rain.

Guests
at the polo dined on grilled peppered fillet of beef, served with an 
arugla and spring vegetable salad and crispy warm panisse, followed by 
vanilla bean creme brule, mixed berry trifle, Lemon Curd tart with mixed
berries and truffle brownie squares.

Just 400 seats were available in all,
however, making it literally the hottest ticket in a town, with dozens 
of elegantly-coiffured ladies – both young and old  - trying to beg, 
borrow or steal an invite.

At
the Greenwich branch of the English-Speaking Union, which promotes 
English language and culture, Natalie Pray, the president, has been 
fielding calls from its 300 members, some blatantly offering cash for 
tickets to see the prince play, according to the New York Times.

Peter
Orthwein, the chief executive of Thor Industries, who is a founding 
member of the Polo Club admitted the prince’s visit had caused a stir.

Mr Orthwein said since he had bought a
table for lunch his wife had been inundated with phone calls from 
friends – mostly women – offering enduring friendship in return for a 
seat.

In a speech shortly before the match,
Harry talked at length about the work of Sentebale in the tiny 
landlocked kingdom of Lesotho where Aids is rife.

He said: 'Whilst Sentebale may be evolving rapidly, the situation on the ground in Lesotho remains critical.

'The
HIV pandemic continues to leave thousands of children without parents 
and family structures to guide them through life. Without this support, 
basic needs such as food, shelter and care remain unmet, leaving 
children vulnerable and very often without much hope in their lives.'

And he concluded by commenting about his
extraordinarily successful tour of the US, saying: 'This is the last 
day of my tour around the United States. Thank you for a wonderful 
week.  I have witnessed the extraordinary generosity of the people of 
this great Nation.'

Harry’s visit promised a lighter tone
than his stop the previous day in New Jersey, where he toured two shore
communities devastated by Superstorm Sandy.

The prince said he was impressed to see “everyone getting together and making things right.”

He also spent Tuesday in New York City at events promoting tourism, entrepreneurism and philanthropy.

Harry, who recently returned from 
duty as an Apache helicopter pilot, will fly back to the UK tonight just
hours after the match has ended to resume his military duties in the 
Army Air Corps.
