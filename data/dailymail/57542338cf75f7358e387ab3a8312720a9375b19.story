With 23 per cent of British adults now classified as obese, it's no surprise that demand for gastric surgery is increasing.

Indeed, over the last 10 years, surgeons have seen an astonishing 3000 per cent increase in Britons opting to go under the knife in a bid to lose weight.

But as new Channel 5 documentary, When Gastric Bands Go Wrong, reveals, having the operation can sometimes cause more problems than it solves.

Explosion: Samantha Haworth's gastric band caused her stomach to explode - with painful consequences

One woman for whom things went terribly wrong is 27-year-old Samantha Haworth who had a gastric band put in at the age of 22.

Always fuller figured, after finishing university, she tipped the scales at an unhealthy 29st and was told she was at risk of an early death if she failed to lose weight.

Horrified, she opted for an Â£8,000 gastric band and swiftly lost an impressive 15st. But a year after the band was put in, she began to suffer from crippling stomach pains which she describes as similar to a 'knife being twisted and moved around my stomach.'

She was rushed to hospital and straight into the operating theatre, where surgeons made a horrifying discovery.

Her gastric band had slipped, causing part of her stomach to die. But worse was to come.

'Fungus had started to grow on the gastric band which turned septic and caused my stomach to just explode,' she reveals.

Consequences: Both Samantha and Rachel (right) know how dangerous gastric surgery can be

Debilitating: Rachel's surgery left her with a leaking bowel and explosive, uncontrollable diarrhoea

Gruesome: Rachel was left with a hole the size of a grapefruit after her gastric bypass went wrong

The damage was so severe, Samantha had to be placed in a medically induced coma for three days while so much of her stomach had to be cut away, she was left with one the size of a little finger.

Five years after her gastric band was put in, Samantha is still struggling. Her reduced stomach can no longer absorb vitamin B12, leaving her permanently exhausted and unable to work.

Another woman to regret taking the plunge is Rachel, a 40-year-old mother of one from Oxfordshire.

Slim in her twenties, Rachel piled on the pounds after hitting 30 and by the age of 32, weighed an unhealthy 22st.

She plumped for a gastric bypass, where most of the stomach is removed and the intestines rerouted.

But although the surgery is trouble free for many, the stitches in Rachel's bowel ruptured and she was left battling intestinal failure.

'When I woke up, I had a grapefruit sized hole in my abdomen,' she remembers. And things would only get worse.

A fresh round of operations aimed at fixing the problem weakened her intestines further, leaving her struggling with rectal failure which manifested itself as constant, uncontrollable, explosive diarrhoea.

'I'm 40 years old and I'm afraid to go outside in case I poo myself,' she said. 'It [surgery] was a complete disaster and I've been paying for it ever since.'

When she does leave the house, it's with a 'diaper bag' containing a complete change of clothes, antibacterial wipes and fresh underwear.

'There have been a few times when I've literally binned all my clothes,' she adds. 'I've lost so much dignity and it's very, very degrading.

'The last eight years have been hell on earth. It's simple. Hell on earth.'
