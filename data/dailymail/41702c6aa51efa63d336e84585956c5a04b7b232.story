With 21 goals already this season few can deny Neymar’s skills on the field, however a video uploaded by the Barcelona superstar singing, shows he shouldn’t quit his day job.

Fresh after scoring two goals in Barcelona’s feisty 3-2 victory over Atletico Madrid, the Brazil international shared a video on his Instagram account of him and a friend singing.

Neymar, pictured in a pink polo-shirt and denim jeans, jams away with what appears to be a full band.

This is not the first time the 22-year-old has shared his love of music with his followers, having previously posted a video with friends singing a Brazilian love song in a car.

What the forward lacks in mic skills, he more than makes up for with his ability on the ball. Neymar is enjoying a prolific season, managing to find the back of the net 21 times in 25 appearances.

He spoke publicly this week, urging the Spanish footballing authorities to punish Cristiano Ronaldo following the Ballon d’Or winners violent outbursts against Cordoba.

The Brazilian included the hashtags #Brasil #Amigos #MiricleInMe in the video.

Neymar has a total of 14.6m followers on Instagram.
