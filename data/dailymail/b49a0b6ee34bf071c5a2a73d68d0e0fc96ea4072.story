This sobering images shows the scale of destruction wrought when an entire hillside in Afghanistan collapsed, levelling a village and killing as many as 2,700 people.

Aab Barik, in the north east of the country, was obliterated by a deadly landslide on Friday morning, which destroyed hundreds of homes and left as many as 4,000 people displaced.

The official death toll in the wake of the disaster is around 500. But more than 2,000 other people have been recorded as missing and - since rescuers have given up trying to find more survivors - it is likely that they have died as well.

The United Nations on Sunday put the death toll from Friday's massive 
landslide in Badakhshan province, bordering Tajikistan, at up to 500. 
Local officials say the number killed could be as high as 2,700.

U.S.
 President Barack Obama called Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Sunday 
to express his condolences and offer additional assistance, the White 
House said in a statement.

Today Afghan
 army helicopters were delivering water, food, medicine and tents to the
 disaster zone, while aid agencies and local relief workers slowly 
arrived via the region's potholed roads.

The UN agency in charge
 of relief operations, the Office for the coordination of Humanitarian 
Affairs (OCHA), said the displaced were largely being accommodated with 
host families, with some in tents.

It is unlikely the final figure will ever 
be known, as officials say it is impossible to retrieve the bodies 
buried in up to 160ft mud and debris.

'We cannot 
continue the search and rescue operation anymore, as the houses are 
under metres of mud,' said Gul Mohammad Bedaar, deputy governor of 
Badakhshan province. 'We will offer prayers for the victims and make the
 area a mass grave.'

'There
 are thousands of families who are in desperate need of help and 
hundreds of other homes are at risk, or possibly another landslide. The government and relief organisations
 must act swiftly and send us more aid and equipment. What we have so 
far is not enough.'

Fears of another landslide prompted officials to
 evacuate the remaining 700 families, or about 4,000 people, to safer 
ground nearby. They may never return to live in their homes in Aab 
Barik.

Sic-year-old Abdul Maqsood today told of his terror when the disaster hit. He said: 'It sounded like a bomb and I screamed, called my father and mother for help. It was so dark and dusty everywhere and I didn't know what happened'.

Bibi Khanum, 55, lost her husband and four children in the devastation. She said: 'Our house
was totally destroyed, we are destroyed and our life is destroyed.

'My
 husband was killed under the rubble and four of my young children. I am
 going crazy without them, repeating their names time and time again.'

Wailing 
near her father's destroyed house, Begum Nisa, a 40-year-old mother of 
three, described the moment when the wall of mud smashed through the 
village.

'I was eating lunch by the window of my house, then suddenly I heard a huge roar. I shouted to my family to save 
themselves, but it was too late. I have lost my dear father and mother. I
 also lost my uncle and five members of his family.'
