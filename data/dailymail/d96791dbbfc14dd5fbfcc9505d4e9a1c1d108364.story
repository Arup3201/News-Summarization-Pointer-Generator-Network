Legal action: Gillian Stokes, 44, is suing Shrewsbury School, claiming she was unfairly dismissed - after she accused a female member of staff of sexually assaulting her

A tuck shop lady is suing a prestigious independent school claiming she was unfairly dismissed - after she accused a female member of staff of sexually assaulting her.

Gillian Stokes, 44, was sacked from her job at Shrewsbury School, whose famous former pupils include Charles Darwin.

She has taken the £30,000-a-year school to an employment tribunal claiming she was unfairly dismissed after she was fired in May 2013.

The 
hearing, in Birmingham, was told Ms Stokes had worked at the school for 
17 years before she was sacked following a ‘breakdown of trust and 
confidence’.

The
 tribunal also heard that days after she was fired, Ms Stokes sent an 
email to all 750 students at the school claiming she had been sexually 
assaulted by a female member of staff.

Ms
 Stokes was also accused of making threatening phone calls and sending 
abusive text messages to former colleagues she felt ‘had betrayed her’, 
the tribunal heard.

She
 is suing the school for £24,000 in loss of wages and ‘hurt feelings’ 
claiming she was sexually assaulted and on another occasion manhandled 
by a male member of staff.

Ms
 Stokes, from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, told the tribunal that she was 
sacked because of her activities with the UCAT trade union.

Giving 
evidence on the first day of the tribunal, she said: ‘The first time 
[she was sexually assaulted] was in 2009 and then again two years 
later.’

Solicitor
 Charles Sparling, representing the school, asked why she had taken more
 than 18 months to inform the police, to which Ms Stokes replied: ‘A lot
 of the reports police receive about sexual assaults are historical.’

Claims: Ms Stokes has taken the £30,000-a-year school to an employment tribunal claiming she was unfairly dismissed after she was fired in May 2013

She added 
that she felt ‘traumatised’ following the alleged assaults and claimed 
she was threatened by another member of staff in February 2012 because 
she organised an unauthorised union meeting.

She said: ‘He threatened me with the sack and placed his hands on my polo-shirt collars and said “we will get you for this.’’

Ms
 Stokes admitted sending an email to staff and pupils claiming she had 
been sexually assaulted saying she ‘regretted her actions’ adding that 
she did it while suffering ‘great emotional distress.’

However, she denied sending messages to former colleagues, including one which read: ‘Careful when you go home.

The tribunal heard that days after she was fired, Gillian Stokes sent an email to all 750 students at Shrewsbury School, pictured, claiming she had been sexually assaulted by a female member of staff

‘Things are bad out there. We wouldn’t want you to have an accident.’

Mr Sparling told the tribunal that between 2005 and 2012, Ms Stokes had filed 16 grievances against the school.

The tribunal heard the school had taken out a High Court injunction and restraining order against Ms Stokes after she took to ‘picketing’ outside the school gates in the months following her dismissal.

The tribunal is expected to last five days.
