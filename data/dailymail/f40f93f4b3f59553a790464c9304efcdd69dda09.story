He has already splashed out £125,000 on having everything from his calves to his nose surgically transformed but that, it seems, isn't enough for air steward Rodrigo Alves.

Mr Alves, 31, has flown to Colombia, where on Monday, he went under the knife for a £50,000 six-in-one super operation.

Procedures included a £13,000 nose job, his fourth so far, a £5,000 operation to fix his droopy eyes and another that saw his toes pinned back.

He also had a gruesome procedure to cut the skin around his mouth and gums to make his smile bigger for £4,000.

Mr Alves, 31, who lives in London, has now racked up 30 body-changing operations - including liposuction, six-pack implants and botox fillers - in a quest to achieve the perfect body.

But with UK doctors unwilling to perform any more surgery, Mr Alves was forced to approach a specialist Columbian clinic and fly to Bogota for bumper operation.

The lengthy surgery saw three doctors work together  to give him the look he wanted, while also completing an £8,000 of liposuction operation.

The fat, which Mr Alves gained on purpose, was then used in a revolutionary £15,000 stem cell procedure which saw the fluid combined with his own blood before being injected back into his hair and skin in a bid to halt the ageing process.

But despite now having spent a whopping £175,000 on his 'dream body', the self-confessed perfectionist says that he’ll never stop going under the knife.

'It’s a long process,' he said. 'It is long-term maintenance. Once you start, it is difficult to stop. Naturally I’m a perfectionist. It’s like a snowball effect and I’m not going to stop.

'It doesn’t define the man that I am - I’m much more than silicone and cosmetic surgery - but once you get started it’s difficult to stop.

'I’m quite hard on myself and I’m scared of getting old - that’s the truth.'

Mr Alves first went under the knife in 2004, after feeling too unattractive to fit in with the fashionable friends he had made while studying in London.

His long list of surgery includes £8,000 on botox and fillers, £30,000 on three nose jobs, £3,000 on liposuction to his jaw and £10,000 on pec implants.

He has also spent £22,000 on a fake six pack, £7,000 on fillers to his arms, £7,000 on hospital bills, £7,000 on laser lipo, £6,000 on leg lipo and £3,000 on calf shaping.

He also indulges in twice-yearly Botox and filler top-ups and takes a cocktail of daily pills consisting of collagen tablets, anti-water retention and hair growth tablets.

His latest six-and-a-half hour surgery included an operation to repair his nose after permanent fillers in the bridge migrated to the tip of his nose, making it round.

Mr Alves also had the cartilage removed from his ear to rebuild his nostrils, which doctors pinned back after they 'got bigger at the age of 27'.

The surgery addict also had the skin between his inside lip and gum cut to give him a wider smile, and liposuction in his legs and back, which was re-injected elsewhere in a bid to make him look younger.

The party-lover insists he works hard to afford the operations with stints as a flight attendant, an image consultant and an event host.

Speaking after the surgery, Rodrigo, who will now spend 10 days recovering before the bandages are removed, said: 'The theory of beauty is to look symmetrical.

'I’m hopefully going to look more symmetrical after this, and therefore more beautiful. It is hard to open my eyes and hard to breathe too but I have a lovely nurse here looking after me.'
