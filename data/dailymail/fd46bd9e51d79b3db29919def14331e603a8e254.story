Apple unveiled a host of new features in its iOS 8 software this week, but neglected to mention one that will leave its users rejoicing - improved battery life.

A presentation slide shown during the tech giant’s Worldwide Developer Conference revealed the next-generation software will monitor battery usage by app. 

The software will be widely available in the autumn, at the same time the iPhone 6 is expected to launch, meaning the much-rumoured handset could finally end Apple’s battery woes.

Despite claiming its iOS 7 software 
would boost energy efficiency, a ‘manufacturing defect’ in October 
caused problems on the iPhone 5S.

Which?
 magazine then compared the battery life of eight high-end smartphones 
including models by Samsung, Apple, HTC, Nokia and BlackBerry.

Samsung's
 Galaxy S4 came top for calls and browsing time, while Apple's iPhone 5S
 and 5C placed in 4th and 7th place respectively. 

By monitoring which apps use the most power, Apple users will be able to keep a closer eye on their battery life and know which services to close, in order to extend it.

Android has had a similar feature for years. 

Leaked images and reports about Apple’s next flagship phone - dubbed iPhone 6 - have been circulating since last year.

If the rumours turn out to be true, the iPhone 6 will have a rounded, thinner design and a larger screen - with some claiming it could jump from the current 4-inch, up to 5.5-inch.

It could also feature a protruding camera, and boast new filters, to create better photos.

In March, Apple was awarded a patent for a power-saving mode.

Apple was recently awarded a patent for a power-saving mode. The files (pictured) detail a system that tracks how a person users their phone, and makes power-saving changes accordingly. Built-in sensors detect changes in light and environment, meaning the device could close apps or alter screen brightness

The application details a system that tracks how a person users their phone using a variety of sensors, and then makes tailored power-saving changes accordingly.

For example, the patent explained that if the system detects a 'relatively dark environment' - such as when a user plays a video game - it may dim the backlight of the display automatically.

It could also decrease the amount of 
power being used by the central processing unit (CPU), while increasing 
the amount of energy needed to power the graphical processing unit (GPU)
 specifically needed for the game.

Developers
 who have been given early access to the iOS 8 software have confirmed 
the battery usage by apps feature, and it could take advantage of some 
of the technologies detailed in this patent.

These images were posted
 on Chinese social network Weibo last month and are thought to 
have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at Apple supplier 
Foxconn. Although the images are blurry, they appear to show a rounded 
design and protruding camera, similar to that seen on the iPod touch
