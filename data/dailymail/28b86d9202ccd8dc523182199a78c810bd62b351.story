Fired regulator: Carmen Segarra, 41, filed a federal lawsuit against the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, saying she was sacked for refusing to change the results of her investigation into Goldman Sachs

A former employee has sued the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, saying she was wrongfully terminated because she refused to change the results of her investigation into Goldman Sachs.

Carmen Segarra, 41, filed her federal lawsuit against the New York Fed Thursday in Manhattan.

Segarra's lawsuit said the New York Fed interfered with her examination of Goldman Sach's legal and compliance divisions and directed her to change her findings. She said she refused and was fired three days later, in May 2012.

The Harvard, Columbia, Sorbonne and Cornell University-educated compliance officer said that in her seven months of examining Goldman, she found the bank did not have policies to prevent conflicts of interest as required by regulation.

The firing caused Segarra’s career in banking to be ‘irreparably damaged,’ stated her lawsuit, which seeks her reinstatement to her position as senior bank examiner, back pay, compensation for lost benefits, compensatory damages, attorney's fees and other expenses.

Segarra's finding led to the New York Fed's Legal and Compliance risk team to approve downgrading Goldman's annual rating pertaining to policies and procedures, the lawsuit said.

It's not clear if the approval led to an actual rate change, but the lawsuit, the threat of one startled Michael Silva, who oversees the New York Fed's relationship with Goldman, and Silva's deputy, Michael Koh.

The two officials were concerned that a downgrade could cause clients to stop doing business with the Wall Street bank, the lawsuit said.

Silva and Koh are named as defendants in Segarra's lawsuit, as is her former supervisor, Johnathon J. Kim.

Segarra stated in her federal complaint cited by Bloomberg Businessweek that in a meeting, Silva said the Fed 'possessed information about Goldman that could cause Goldman to ‘explode.'

A spokesman for the New York Fed declined to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit but said its personnel decisions ‘are based exclusively on individual job performance and are subject to thorough review.’

‘We categorically reject any suggestions to the contrary,’ spokesman Jack Gutt said.

Goldman Sachs said it had no knowledge of internal Fed discussions ‘nor the matters raised by Ms. Segarra.’

‘Goldman Sachs has a comprehensive approach to addressing conflicts through firmwide and divisional policies and infrastructure,’ Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally said.

Segarra, formerly a legal counsel at Societe Generale, Citigroup and Bank of America, was assigned to Goldman's legal and compliance divisions from October 2011 until May 2012, and looked into three controversial transactions related to Solyndra, Capmark and the merger of El Paso and Kinder Morgan.

At that point, Kim, Silva and Koh fired her and had her escorted from the building by security guards after weeks of disputes and pressure to change her examination findings, the lawsuit said.

Segarra's lawyer, Linda Stengle, said in an interview that Goldman's committees and standards represented ‘a paper policy that didn't really have any weight.’

Stengle said that Goldman executives in charge of conflicts told Segarra and other Fed examiners that they did not have a firmwide conflicts policy and also gave inconsistent statements about the conflicts board's duties and findings.

‘Bank examiners should be able to operate without fear of retaliation against the banks that they're examining,’ said Stengle. Instead, she said her client was ‘cornered’ by supervisors who ‘tried to force her or persuade her very heavily to change her findings.’
