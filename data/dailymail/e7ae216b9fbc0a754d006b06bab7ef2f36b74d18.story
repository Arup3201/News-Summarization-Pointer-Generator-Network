They aren't soul mates, but ex-couple Sabrina Timms and Daniel Burdick are a perfect match in another, life-saving, way.

When 35-year-old Timms, of Petaluma, California was diagnosed with double kidney failure in January 2013, Burdick got tested and turned out to be the perfect organ donor.

Burdick immediately volunteered to give up one of his kidneys to the mother of his young daughter named Hope - a selfless act that required the singer-songwriter to cancel a national music tour.

Still close: Burdick and Timms were engaged to be married eight years ago, but broke it off when he decided to focus on his music. Burdick is pictured above with their young daughter Hope. He and Timms remained friends and co-parent their daughter

The co-parents were engaged eight years ago, but decided to call things off when Burdick chose to focus on his music instead.

Gift: When Timms was diagnosed with double kidney failure in January 2013, her ex got tested and turned out to be a perfect organ donor. They undergo transplant surgery Tuesday at noon in San Francisco. Timms is pictured above in a photo from her Facebook

'We had a difference of opinions about what we wanted for the future,' Timms told KGO. 'I wanted to settle down.'

'And I wanted to follow my dreams,' Burdick said.

'He wanted to do his music,' Timms finished.

However, the two remained friends as they worked to raise their daughter together.

'The love stills stands,' Burdick said.

So when Timms' kidneys failed a year and a half ago, she started dialysis while waiting to find a donor.

Burdick joined other friends and family members and underwent a test to see if he was eligible to be a donor.

Timms' father and uncle were both tested and neither qualified. Finding the perfect donor is a rarity, and sometimes patients wait decades on lists to get an organ.

Currently there are more than 120,00 people on donor lists across the country, and about 18 die a day waiting.

Burdick decided to give up his music tour for Timms and their daughter Hope.

'That tour was my biggest dream,' he told KTVU. 'In the end, though, this is more important. She is my child's mother.'

Timms hopes her unlikely story will lead others to get tested to be live donors.

Music can wait: Burdick, a singer-songwriter, had to give up a national music tour in order to undergo surgery but he says it's worth it
