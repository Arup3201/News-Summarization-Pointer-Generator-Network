These are the faces of four of Britain's most wanted fraudsters.

They are believed to be operating out of Spain, and are suspected of duping people into buying worthless shares or investing their life savings in to fake companies.

Officers from British and Spanish police forces have launched a Europe-wide search for the group who are said to have masterminded so-called boiler room scams, targeting elderly and vulnerable people in the UK, Serbia and Spain.

Graham Hawrysh, 37, is one of those suspected of helping to set up and manage a number of these schemes in Spain.

He is alleged to have links to a global network of investment fraudsters targeting UK consumers.

Another, Jeffrey Gordon, 54, has links to Romania, and possibly Colombia or Ireland, and has reportedly used a number of aliases to run similar scams around the world.

Robert Douglas Lynch, 53, is accused of being involved in the set-up of accounts in Spain and the UK in order to facilitate the laundering of funds from investment fraud from the UK to Spain.

The fourth man is Tunch Kashif, 48. He is believed to have been engaged in various investment frauds spanning several years. He is said to have recently been involved in Fine Wine Investment Fraud with a company called Campus Investments which offered fraudulent shares to UK investors.

The names of the targeted men were released a week after a worldwide anti-fraud operation saw 110 people arrested during raids in Barcelona, Madrid, Marbella and London.

Working alongside the National Crime Agency, City of London Police and Spanish National Police searched luxury properties and seized sports cars including Ferraris, all believed to have been bought by profits of the elaborate schemes.

These investment scams are run by individuals based overseas and target innocent victims by luring them into investing in bogus companies.

British and foreign nationals based in Spain pinpoint the most vulnerable members of the UK public through cold-calling.

They particularly target elderly people, offering them worthless, overpriced or non-existent shares and pressuring them to use their savings to become investors.

They promise a good return on investment but ultimately they are steal people's life savings to fund their extravagant overseas lifestyle.

Students and other young people from the UK are being recruited to work in boiler rooms within Spain, being lured to work abroad in a hot country with the chance of earning large amounts of money.

Lord Ashcroft, founder and chair of Crimestoppers, said: 'Serious fraudsters often operate as part of gangs and fraud is just one of their business streams.

'This can result in the funding of drugs and people trafficking, which causes harm to many.'

Roger Critchell, director of operations for Crimestoppers, said: 'There is nothing glamorous about these fraudsters stealing the life savings of elderly people across the UK and living lavish lives from the proceeds of crime.'
