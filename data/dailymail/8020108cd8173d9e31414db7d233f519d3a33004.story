As well as winning the accolade of becoming the first British man to win Wimbledon since 1936, Andy Murray also woke up £1.6million richer today.

Just hours after he took the title, speculation was rife about what Murray will spend his winnings on - the leading suggestion was that he will make another heroic gesture after giving previous tournament cash to the the Royal
Marsden Cancer Charity.

The charity  could not comment on the speculation, but one user tweeted: 'Andy Murray donated his winnings at Queen's. He's a fine man and a great Wimbledon champion and nothing can spoil that.'

While another wrote: 'Andy Murray won 1.6 Million today, he donated all of it to Cancer Research, Huge respect!'

If he did donate a portion of the prize winnings, Murray could quickly replenish his earnings - he is now expected to earn £100million from endorsements.

Last month Murray donated his £73,000 
prize money from winning the AEGON Championships at Queen's to charity, which has been treating his friend tennis player Ross Hutchins.

Hutchins who is a close friend of the Scot and one of his British Davis Cup team-mates has been battling Hodgkin’s lymphoma since being diagnosed last Christmas.

The 28-year-old was among his most loyal and vociferous supporters at Centre Court.

Sitting

Murray on throughout the game, pumping his fist when he won crucial 
points.

Hutchins, who 
wore a suit but no tie for the occasion, has told how much Murray’s 
support has meant to him throughout his illness.

'I've been close with Andy for 15 years, or something,' he told ITV's Daybreak.

'He's been very supportive for me. He's been like a rock for me. He's one of my closest friends, we go back a long way and he's been with me (every) step.

'Hopefully, we're through the worse 
of it and through all the chemotherapy and we can move forward with the 
rest of my life and hopefully get back on court.'

Hutchins went on to praise Murray's ability to separate his sporting and personal life.

'He
doesn't look like he's fazed by anything. It seems like he can put 
things aside - when he's on the court and when he's off the court - he 
can switch away from tennis,' Hutchins said.

Star studded: Murray was joined on court by London Mayor Boris Johnson, Jonathan Ross, Jimmy Carr, Ross Hutchins, Tim Henman, Sir Richard Branson, Eddie Redmayne and Michael McIntyre at a charity fundraiser last month

'He's
been a huge support and there hasn't been anyone who has been stronger 
for me and someone who I can rely on any more than him.'

Last month Hutchins organised the Rally Against Cancer 
that drew a star-studded crowd to the Queen’s Club in west London.

Murray joined with Tim Henman,
coach Ivan Lendl and the likes of Sir Richard Branson, Boris Johnson, 
Michael McIntyre and Jonathan Ross to raise money.

Murray’s gesture added to the £144,000 that had been collected through 
tickets, prizes and donations associated with the slapstick 
hit-and-giggle exhibition that followed a doubles match, featuring his 
coach Ivan Lendl and fellow Czech Tomas Berdych against the British No 1
and Tim Henman.

A representative for Andy Murray said he could not comment because a decision had not been made.
