This is the moment opportunistic robbers hit a businessman over the head with a crowbar before speeding off in his van to leave him for dead in the gutter.

Ali Jawaid, 43, died after being ambushed by Gregg Robertson, 24, and Glenroy Blackstock, 25, who attacked him outside a phone shop on the evening of November 9, 2011.

CCTV shows a third man Shaun Mills, 27, inside the Benzer Communications store, in Coventry, West Midlands, moments earlier taking an interest in Mr Jawaid’s stock on the counter as he made a delivery of handsets.

Mills - who was exchanging his Blackberry phone at the time - can then be seen making a call to his two friends to alert them to the valuable hoard the customer had just delivered.

Robertson and Blackstock then launched their ferocious attack and snatched the keys to Mr Jawaid’s van before speeding off with his stock as he lays unconscious in the gutter.

The father-of-two suffered a fractured skull and died six days later in hospital.

After the fatal robbery the group drove in convoy through the north of Coventry, eventually dumping the van down a remote farmer’s track near Hawkesbury, Warwickshire, where they plundered its contents.

Police later found the van’s burnt-out shell surrounded by empty boxes and phone batteries the following day.  Detectives launched an investigation and identified some of their key suspects within days of the attack as they were all known gang members. 

Today at Leamington Justice Centre the trio, all from Coventry, were jailed for a total of 27 years.

Mills and Blackstock admitted manslaughter and robbery, while Robertson also admitted manslaughter after being found not guilty of murder by a jury at the same court last week.

Robertson and Blackstock were both jailed for eight years, while Mills was sentenced to a total of 11 years behind bars. He was also convicted of another separate armed robbery.

Fellow gang member Ryan McTighe, 26, admitted robbery and was handed a six year jail term, whilst two other men - Lee Taylor, 22, and Liberato Galiazia, 23, admitted handling stolen goods and were sentenced to 12 months prison.

A seventh man - 26-year-old Nigel Barwell - was found guilty of handling stolen goods and was sentenced to 18 months in jail.

Detective Sergeant Gerrard Amadeo, from West Midlands Police’s Major Investigation Team, said after the case: 'This was a case where the co-defendants all played an active part - be it in the attack, the robbery or the handling.

'It was all motivated by their greed and the opportunity to part Mr Jawaid from his livelihood. It was planned and premeditated.

'We proved through advanced phone analysis that Mills corralled the group and McTighe, Robertson and Blackstock made their way to the offence location understanding they would play an active role.

'Once there, they were all complicit in the offence irrespective of the roles they played.'

In a statement issued through police Ali Jawaid’s brother Bilal, 35, said: 'Ali was a law-abiding, hard-working gentle family man who has left behind a wife and two young children.

'He will be terribly missed by all who were lucky enough to have had their lives touched in some way by Ali.

'However it is Ali’s wife, children and the rest of his family and friends who have been left with the life sentence as we will have to continue each day knowing we will never see Ali again.'
