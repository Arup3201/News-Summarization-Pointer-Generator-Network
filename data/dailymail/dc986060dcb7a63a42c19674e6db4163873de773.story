A Colombian prostitute at the centre 
of the ongoing Secret Service sex scandal has broken her silence.

Speaking about the tawdry 
episode that has seen three agents ousted from their posts after a 
wild night of partying in Cartagena last week, a 24-year-old high-end escort claims 
she was offered $30 - a fraction of her $800 fee - for a night with one of the men.

'I tell him, 'Baby, my cash money,' 
she recalled in an interview with The New York Times, recounting a heated exchange that has wrecked the agency's 
reputation and become an election year embarrassment for President 
Barack Obama.

Seedy: The PleyClub, in Cartagena, Colombia, where Obama's Secret Service agents allegedly picked up prostitutes

The news came today as the Secret 
Service says three employees have been ousted in the wake of questionable behaviour at the Hotel Caribe last week, with some now under investigation for possible drug use, ABC 
News reports.

New details of the sordid night 
emerged Wednesday as a single mother and self-described prostitute told 
The New York Times that she met an agent at a discotheque, believed to be the PleyClub, in Cartagena 
and after a night of drinking.

'They never told me they were with Obama,' she said, calling the men 'very discreet'.

The woman, who chose to remain 
anonymous, said she and one of the agents agreed the agent would pay her
$800 for sex at the hotel.

The next morning, when the hotel's front desk called because the woman hadn't left, the pair argued over the price.

In an interview in Colombia, she said 
the two argued after the agent initially offered to pay her about $30 
and the situation escalated, eventually ending with Colombian law 
enforcement involved. She said she was eventually paid about $225.

Days later, she said a friend told her the argument had made the news, and to her shock, she discovered the man was a Secret Service agent.

'I'm scared,' she said, adding that she did not want the man in question to be reprimanded, and fears retaliation, the Times reports.

'This is something really big,' she added. 'This is the government of the United States. I have nervous 
attacks. I cry all the time'

Eleven Secret Service agents were 
eventually sent home from the colonial-era city of Cartagena on 
Colombia's Caribbean coast after a wild night of partying that saw many 
of the agents bring escorts back to their rooms, according to reports.

Special agents and uniformed officers 
were stationed in Cartagena in advance of President Barack Obama's 
arrival for the Summit of the Americas. The incident occurred before 
Obama arrived and was at a different hotel than the president stayed in.

In the first casualties claimed in 
wake of the incident, the Secret Service announced today three agents 
are leaving the service, even as separate U.S. government investigations
are under way.

The Secret Service did not identify 
the three agents leaving the government or eight more it said remain on 
administrative leave. In a statement, it said one supervisor was allowed
to retire and another will be fired for cause. A third employee, who 
was not a supervisor, has resigned.

The agents were implicated in the 
prostitution scandal in Colombia that also involved about 10 military 
service members and as many as 20 women. All the Secret Service 
employees who were involved had their security clearances revoked.

'These are the first steps,' said 
Representative Pete King, R-New York, chairman of the House Homeland 
Security Committee, which oversees the Secret Service. King said the 
agency's director, Mark Sullivan, took employment action against 'the 
three people he believes the case was clearest against.' But King 
warned: 'It's certainly not over.'

News
that 11 Secret Service agents had been sent home after 'nearly all of 
them' were caught with prostitutes all but overshadowed President Barack
Obama's trip to Colombia this weekend.

The
scandal unfolded rapidly after a tipster called the Associated Press 
and reported the incident Wednesday night at the luxurious Hotel Caribe 
in Cartagena, where the agents were staying while the conducted advance 
security operations to prepare for the president's arrival.

The agents allegedly picked up the hookers at the seedy PleyClub after a night of heavy drinking and hard-partying there.

They were busted after a prostitute 
got angry and caused a commotion involving hotel security and local 
police when one agent refused to pay her. The tab? $47.

Two of the men were supervisors. Several are married and all of them have been suspended, pending an investigation.

Experts say the scandal could have exposed the agents to blackmail and potentially endangered the president.

President
Obama, whom the Secret Service claims was never in danger, said he 
would be 'angry' if the allegations are proven true.

Rep
Darrell Issa, a California Republican, suggested Secret Service agents 
might be covering up other sex scandals when he said, 'Things like this don't happen once if they didn't happen before.'

King said the agent set to be fired 
would sue. King said Sullivan had to follow collective bargaining rules 
but was 'moving as quickly as he can. Once he feels the facts are clear,
he's going to move.'

In Washington and Colombia, separate 
U.S. government investigations were already under way. King said he has 
assigned four congressional investigators to the probe. The House 
Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, led by Rep. Darrell Issa, 
R-California, sought details of the Secret Service investigation, 
including the disciplinary histories of the agents involved. Secret 
Service investigators are in Colombia interviewing witnesses.

In a letter to Sullivan, Issa and 
Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the committee's ranking 
Democrat, said the agents 'brought foreign nationals in contact with 
sensitive security information.' A potential security breach has been 
among the concerns raised by members of Congress.

The episode took a sharp political 
turn when presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said 
he would fire the agents involved.

Romney told radio host Laura Ingraham on Wednesday that 'I'd clean house' at the Secret Service.

'The right thing to do is to remove 
people who have violated the public trust and have put their play time 
and their personal interests ahead of the interests of the nation,' 
Romney said.

While Romney suggested to Ingraham 
that a leadership problem led to the scandal, he told a Columbus, Ohio, 
radio station earlier that he has confidence in Sullivan, the head of 
the agency.

'I believe the right corrective action
will be taken there and obviously everyone is very, very disappointed,'
Romney said. 'I think it will be dealt with (in) as aggressive a way as
is possible given the requirements of the law.'

When asked, the Romney campaign would 
not say whether he had been briefed on the situation or was relying upon
media reports for details.

At least 10 military personnel who were staying at the same hotel are also being investigated for misconduct.

Two U.S. military officials have said 
they include five Army Green Berets. One of the officials said the group
also includes two Navy Explosive Ordinance Disposal technicians, two 
Marine dog handlers and an Air Force airman. The officials spoke on 
condition of anonymity because the investigation is still under way.

Secret Service's Office of 
Professional Responsibility, which handles that agency's internal 
affairs, is investigating, and the Homeland Security Department's 
inspector general also has been notified.

Sullivan, who this week has briefed 
lawmakers behind closed doors, said he has referred to the case to an 
independent government investigator.

Prostitution is legal in some parts of Colombia and tolerated in most of the country

Colonel Scott Malcom, a spokesman of 
U.S. Southern Command, which organized the military team assigned to 
support the Secret Service's mission in Cartagena, said Wednesday that 
an Air Force colonel is leading the military investigation and arrived 
in Colombia with a military lawyer Tuesday morning.

The troops are suspected of violating curfews set by their commanders.

'They were either not in their room or
they showed up to their room late while all this was going on or they 
were in their room with somebody who shouldn't be there,' Malcom said.

Lawmakers have called for a thorough 
investigation and have suggested they would hold oversight hearings, 
though none has yet been scheduled. The incident is expected to come up 
next week on Wednesday when Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano
appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee for a previously 
scheduled oversight hearing.

House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, 
said that for now, he is interested in what actually happened. He did 
not address how much responsibility Obama should bear for the scandal or
whether Congress should hold hearings on it.
