Verdict: An inquest has found that Shane Todd, a high-tech researcher who died in Singapore in June, 2012, killed himself

An American engineer who was found dead in his apartment in Singapore last year killed himself and was not murdered, a coroner ruled today.

Shane Todd, 31, was found dead in his apartment in Singapore by his girlfriend in June 2012.

A Singapore state coroner has ruled Dr Todd had committed suicide, but his family believe that he was murdered because of research into sensitive technology.

But the U.S. Embassy has described the inquest into Shane Truman Todd's death as fair and comprehensive.

It comes weeks after Dr Todd's parents walked out of the hearings, saying they had lost faith in the process.

Singapore's foreign minister said the ruling was based on 'incontrovertible evidence'.

State counsel presented evidence of links to suicide websites on his laptop and suicide letters written to family members and loved ones.

Judge Chay Yuen Fatt said he found no evidence of foul play, ruling that Dr Todd 'committed suicide by hanging himself'.

Chay recorded the official cause of death as 'asphyxia due to hanging' and voiced hopes that Mr Todd's family and loved ones would be able to find closure.

Dr Todd's parents have said they believe he may have been murdered over his research in the U.S. into material used to make heat-resistant semiconductors, a technology with both civilian and military applications.

Statement: Singapore's Foreign Minister K Shanmugam said the inquest verdict was based on 'clear, incontrovertible evidence'

Witness: Shane's girlfriend Shirley Sarmiento (center on May 14 with the Todd family) testified at the inquest into the 31-year-old death

Warning: Shane Todd's father Rick said his son 
had become fearful for his safety due to the sensitive technological 
research he was engaged in

Rick and Mary Todd left Singapore in May before the inquest ended. They said they believed the evidence of suicide was faked and that officials had not followed protocol in the investigation, including in how they accessed Dr Todd's computers and examined the location of his death. Singaporean authorities have denied the claims.

Mary Todd, speaking from her home state of Montana, said that 'today's result means nothing to us because we expected it'. Her husband said last week the family no longer trusts Singapore's legal system.

'It was apparent that the state was only interested in proving suicide and that was why we left,' Rick Todd wrote in an email.

The U.S. Embassy in Singapore said in a statement that the inquiry had been 'comprehensive, fair and transparent'.

It said embassy officers had attended the entire hearing, and that the Dr Todd family had been given the opportunity to participate in the hearing and was represented by experienced legal counsel. It expressed sympathy to Dr Todd's family and friends for their loss.

K Shanmugam, Singapore's minister for law and foreign affairs, said the city-state had cooperated with U.S. authorities, including the FBI, and acted according to the law 'to get to the truth'.

'The verdict is clear, Dr. Todd committed suicide and that conclusion was based on clear, incontrovertible evidence,' Shanmugam told reporters. 'Many of us are parents and can understand the family's grief. At the same time, we need the strength to face the truth and not make fictional and untrue statements.'

Dr Todd's parents said documents he had backed up from his work computer included a draft of a project outline between Singapore's Institute of Microelectronics - Shane Todd's former employer - and Chinese telecom giant Huawei on the development of a device that utilized gallium nitride.

The heat-resistant material has civilian uses in products like LED screens and cellphone towers, and military applications possibly for radar and satellite systems.

Huawei and Singapore officials have said they did not proceed beyond initial discussions into a possible project involving gallium nitride. The Institute of Microelectronics has said neither Todd nor the company was involved in any classified research.

Enough: Rick and Mary Todd believe their son was murdered last year in Singapore. They withdrew from the inquest, saying they have no confidence in the city-state's legal process
