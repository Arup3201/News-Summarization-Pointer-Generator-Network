A robber has been jailed for life after a member of the public spotted him trying to hold up a bank with a fake gun.

Andrew Fernandez’s life of crime came to an end when he walked in to the Lloyds bank in Coulsdon, Croydon, in November only to be detained by customer James Rowley until police arrived and arrested him.

Fernandez, of no fixed abode, who had pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery and one count of attempted robbery was sentenced to life imprisonment at Kingston Crown Court while Mr Rowley has won a £1,200 police bravery award for helping to trap him.

Wearing a motorcycle helmet, Fernandez, 47, demanded money from the cashier and threatened her with what appeared to be a hand gun.

Mr Rowley, who was also inside the bank at the time, spotted the gun was a fake and told Fernandez to leave.

Fernandez did not take the hint and kept threatening the cashier.

It was only after Mr Rowley challenged him that Fernandez decided to flee - on a push bike.

The getaway failed as Mr Rowley, helped by a friend who was in a nearby van, chased him down and held him until the police arrived.

Mr Rowley told detectives he had seen Fernandez throw something into a nearby building site.

They later found the fake firearm and detectives from the Metropolitan Police’s Flying Squad were able to link Fernandez with two, almost identical robberies.

Fernandez pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery and one count of
attempted robbery

The first robbery took place on July 12, 2013 in The Broadway, Mill Hill, Barnet while the second robbery took place on September 27, 2013 in Garston Park Parade, Watford, Hertfordshire.

Fernandez was subsequently charged with two additional counts of robbery and two counts of possession of an imitation firearm in relation to these incidents.

Mr Rowley, who was presented with £1,200 from the sheriff’s fund for his bravery, at Kingston Crown Court, said: 'When I saw him enter the bank waving the gun around, making demands I just acted on instinct.

'I thought that the gun wasn’t real and therefore I knew I had to act.

'At the time I didn’t think it was brave I thought it was my duty to get involved, ignoring it was not the answer.

'I told him to leave and then he tried to escape I immediately thought no he is not going to get away with this so chased him with the help of my friend, holding him down until the officers came along.

'What’s happened since then with receiving an Assistant Commissioner’s commendation and now being awarded a police bravery award, well I am humbled.'

He has also received a commendation for his actions by Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley and will also be awarded a Police Public Bravery Award at the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) annual awards ceremony on June 19.

Detective Sergeant David Barnfather, of the Met’s Flying Squad, said: 'The bravery of James Rowley was truly remarkable in confronting what was for all intents and purposes, an armed and extremely dangerous criminal.

'Mr Rowley’s courage and sense of civic duty are to be applauded and thanks to him Fernandez is behind bars.'
