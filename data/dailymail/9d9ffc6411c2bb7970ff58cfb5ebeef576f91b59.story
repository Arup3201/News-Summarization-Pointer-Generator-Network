Engineering students have  created a couch with wheels that has been driving them around campus and to adventures across the road.

It began as a joke between a couple of students at the University at New South Wales in Australia but after suggesting the idea to their supervisor the development of an electric couch was brought forward. 

'We use much smaller versions of these wheels on little robots we make at university... we suggested to one of our supervisors that we build a couch on  giant wheels and so we did,' Stephanie McArthur, one of the students behind the project told BBC.

The device may look like any other Ikea couch but in the inside it has been stripped and replaced to allow the couch to be transformed into a robot

The electric device can move in any direction which is manually controlled by an Xbox game-pad

The electric couch was designed on the computer in CAD,  computer-aided design, and then sent to a workshop in the engineering facility where they added all the components together. 

'We've got the scooter wheels inside that we've bolted down, attached all the gears and chains and then we put the modified Ikea couch on top,' Ms McArthur said.  

She said  it looks like any other couch on the outside but in the inside it has been stripped and replaced to allow transformation of an average Ikea couch to a moving robot.

The electric device can move in any direction which is manually controlled by an Xbox game-pad.

The video above show UNSW students laughing as they navigate their way through elevators and on footpaths while they sit on the red double-seated robot couch. 

'We did take it down to McDonalds one night that is close to campus -we have had a few adventures with it,' Ms McArthur said.

'Seeing a couch move around is much more exciting than a robot.'  

In the future UNSW hopes to add more senses and intelligence to the device.
