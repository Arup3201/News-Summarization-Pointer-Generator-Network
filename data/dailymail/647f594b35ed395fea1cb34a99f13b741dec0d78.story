A ten-year-old girl has raised over £30,000 for a children's hospice in just eight months simply by playing her violin to passers by in the street.

Talented Madison Glinski raised the astonishing sum by busking on the streets of St Ives and Truro, Cornwall. 

Her original target had been just £500, but since she began in Easter, Madison has raised a staggering £32,520 for the Children's Hospice South West.

The youngster, who has played violin since the age of four, started busking earlier this year with the aim of hitting her fundraising target before Christmas.

So many people got behind the young violinist she ended up raising 60 times her target for the charity's Little Harbour hospice in Cornwall.

As well as busking Madison, who plays grade four standard, also raised money by attending car boot sales and auctioning off her own toys.

The altruistic youngster's original target had been just £500 but generous passers-by saw Madison raise her target on sixty occasions 

And to top it all off her exploits are being recognised on the Christmas edition of TV show Surprise Surprise after being nominated by proud mum Terrasa, 48.

She said: 'Madison is very caring. She made a New Year's resolution to help poorly children and decided to try and raise £500 for the Children's Hospice South West.

'She thought that was all she would be able to raise but so many people have donated it just grew and grew. 

'When she started she just had her violin case open for donations but as she went on she started putting up signs saying what she was doing it for and it grew from there.

'People were leaving £20 notes sometimes - it was astonishing. Then she started a JustGiving page and people how saw her busk would then go and donate money through that.' 

Terrasa added: 'She has a bit of a musical talent and has used it to help others.

'She has a special passion and dedication for it.'

It's not the first time Madison has reached out to help others.

The family normally go away over Christmas but a few years ago Madison asked her parents if they could all go to Africa instead to help children there.

Madison collected unwanted items from friends, neighbours and used her own pocket money and managed to collect 700Ibs worth of toys, shoes, clothes and school equipment to take to Africa.

As soon as the family returned Madison started to plan for the next trip.  

Surprise Surprise is broadcast at 8pm on ITV on December 21.
