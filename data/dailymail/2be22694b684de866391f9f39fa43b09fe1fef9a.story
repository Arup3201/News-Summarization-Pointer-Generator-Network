Shocking video from the mountains of Afghanistan show a a 500-pound bomb dropped by U.S. bombers land on a U.S. Army infantry outpost after the bombers mistook the outpost for a Taliban hideout.

The dramatic video shows soldiers at the outpost watch as an Air Force bomber flew overhead. Seconds after seeing the bomber, there is a loud explosion, and the soldiers reacting with poise amongst the chaos caused by the explosion.

Thankfully, there were no casualties caused by what appears to be a mistake made by pilot of the bomber.

Near miss: An Air Force bomber mistakenly dropped a 500-pound bomb on an Army infantry outpost

Boom: An angle of the explosion from the ground shows the massive size of the explosion

Close call: Soldiers in the outpost record the smoke plume just next to their outpost

According to Funker530.com - a website for military veterans, Army mortar teams spotted Taliban forces on a ridge far from their position in the rugged mountains of Afghanistan's Paktika Province along the Pakistani border.

Simultaneously, airstrikes were called in to take out the opposition forces.

It appears, however, that the pilot mistook the Army outpost for the Taliban fighters and dropped a 500-pound bomb on their location - narrowly missing the soldiers at the outpost. 

'Honestly we had dropped so many bombs up to that point that the thought 
never even crossed my mind that this could even happen, especially with 
all the checks put into place,' one of the soldiers tells the website. 'About a half second before impact you 
could hear the bomb screaming in like I hadn’t ever heard before, and I 
definitely knew at that point something was off.'

Terror: The soldiers were rattled by the initial explosion, but luckily none of them were killed or injured

The enemy: Soldiers spotted Taliban fights on a ridge line far from their camp, and an air strike had been ordered to take them out

Rattled: The bomb hit just feet away from the Army outpost, where soldiers fire mortars at enemy fighters

The soldier says the impact was so powerful that it knocked people to the ground.

'After the initial realization that it had hit behind us, we were so 
scatter brained trying to figure out what happened. It hit so close to 
the guys in the tower it actually knocked the fill out of radios,' he said.

'Once the smoke had cleared and we realized that no one was seriously 
injured, we were just sitting there in awe as the anger started to 
build,' he continued.

It remains unclear what caused this near-fatal mistake.
