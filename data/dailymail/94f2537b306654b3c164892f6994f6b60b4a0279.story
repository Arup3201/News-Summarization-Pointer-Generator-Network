An infuriated father has paid his entire schools property tax with one dollar bills in protest because he teaches his children from home.

The stunt carried out by Robert Fernandes was caught on camera and shows the dad handing over $7,148 individual notes.

The footage has now been viewed more than 270,000 times online.

Mr Fernandes believes making him pay the tax is 'unfair' and 'unethical' because he home-schools all three of his children. He said he refuses to pay for a public service which his family does not use.

A point to make: The father arrived at the tax office with a duffel bag full of dollar bills

The much-berated tax charges property owners to fund the state's public education.

Depending on how big each state's federal grant is, this tax can account for anything between 25 and 55 per cent of the state's allowance for schools.

Arriving at the local tax office on 30 August, with a duffel bag full to burst, the father from Forks Township, PA, proceeds to stack the individual notes on a counter.

And he brought doughnuts for 'anyone who is inconvenienced here today'.

Unloading his payment, Mr Fernandes explains his plight to all who will listen.

He said: 'It would be the equivalent if McDonald’s were to force vegetarians to pay for their cheeseburgers.

'We don’t even use the public system, yet I am being forced to pay all this money into a public school system.

'I don’t think that’s really either fair or just or even ethical.'

A video of Robert Fernandes' protest against the 'unfair' and 'unethical' schools property tax has been viewed more than 270,000 times

The visual protest was designed so people could see how much money was being taken from Mr Fernandes

After a few minutes of stacking, the 
woman behind the counter implores Mr Fernandes to go to the bank with 
her where a professional can verify the amount quicker.

The visual protest was designed so 'people can actually see how money is being taken from me,' Mr Fernandes added.

He tells the woman behind the counter: 'I’m not doing this to make anybody’s life more difficult.

'Unfortunately, I wish the same could be said, you know, for me and many others whose lives are more difficult for having to pay property taxes.'

The stunt was met with applause from viewers on Twitter.

Jennifer Cooke tweeted: 'HILARIOUS!'

Maria Halliday said: 'Home school & pays with $1s?! A man of my own heart'

Chad Worz said: 'This man is a light in the darkness'

Like many inspired by the performance, Matthew J Hayden tweeted: 'I think I'll follow suit'
