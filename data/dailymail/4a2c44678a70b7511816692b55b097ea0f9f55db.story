New documents lay bare Britain’s collusion with Libya in the systemic rendition, torture and harassment of Colonel Gaddafi’s enemies, the Daily Mail can reveal.

Court papers detail the extent to which the UK ‘illegally’ used information extracted from prisoners abused in Libyan jails to try to deport enemies of the dictator who had been given political asylum here.

Spies for MI5 and MI6 worked closely with the regime to target 12 exiled dissidents. 

Shameful new evidence of Britain’s collusion with Libya in the systemic rendition, torture and harassment of Colonel Gaddafi’s enemies is here laid bare by the Mail

In one instance, it is claimed, an intelligence agent quizzed a British citizen captured by the Saudi authorities over his links to a Libyan terror group – and turned a blind eye to his desperate pleas that he was being tortured.

The court papers raise fresh questions about the extent to which the Blair Government was complicit in the abuse of terror suspects and the scale to which UK involvement has been covered up.

They also appear to highlight flagrant breaches of laws supposed to protect political refugees, their families and friends.

The crackdown began after Tony Blair cosied up to Gaddafi as part of the infamous ‘deal in the desert’ in March 2004, believing the ruthless dictator would help in the fight against Al Qaeda. After the Government lost a legal bid yesterday to throw out the victims’ damages case, the Mail can reveal:

British intelligence agents were allegedly complicit in a secret policy of ‘torture by proxy’ by providing questions for Libyan interrogators to ask detainees.

Documents detailing the collusion between Britain, the US and Libya were found in the bombed-out Tripoli residence of the British ambassador and in the office of the head of Libyan intelligence after the Gaddafi regime crumbled in September 2011.

The abuse took place in Libya's Tajoura and Abu Salim prisons, the latter, in Tripoli, is pictured above

Ministers tried to deport Libyan dissidents back into Gaddafi’s clutches despite knowing they faced a ‘real risk’ of being imprisoned and abused, court papers claim

The 12 dissidents – at least nine of whom were British citizens or residents – are suing MI5, MI6, the Attorney General, the Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary for false imprisonment, assault, misfeasance in public office and negligence.

Five claim they were unlawfully detained pending deportation.When that was blocked by judges because they faced torture in Libya, they were wrongly placed under control orders. Four say Britain was ‘complicit in their arrest, detention and torture’ in Libya and Saudi Arabia.

One alleges MI5 gave direct help to Libyan agents working in the UK by threatening him with detention if he did not turn informer. Two, who were linked to a Muslim charity, claim they were wrongly put on a UN list of Al Qaeda sympathisers and had their assets frozen for years.

In most cases, it is claimed, the UK took action against the men based on information obtained under torture from two prisoners handed to Libya via the CIA’s unlawful ‘extraordinary rendition’ programme. Abdelhakim Belhadj and Sami Al Saadi were part of an anti-Gaddafi group.

Britain has already paid Mr Saadi £2.2million compensation after he took legal action over the Secret Intelligence Service’s role in his abduction, imprisonment and mistreatment by Libya. Mr Belhadj is currently suing the UK.

The legal battle raises the prospect of former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw and Sir Mark Allen, a former senior MI6 spy, being called to court to give evidence.

A Government spokesman said last night it ‘noted’ the High Court judgment but declined to comment further.

Mr Blair believed Gaddafi, who renounced weapons of mass destruction, would provide invaluable help in the fight against Al Qaeda. MI6 requested ‘detailed information… however trivial’ from Islamic detainees in Libya, including about LIFG members in the UK; Blair is pictured above embracing Gaddafi in May 2007
