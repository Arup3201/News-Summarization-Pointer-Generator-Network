Fish come in many shapes and sizes and now scientists have identified more than 180 species that glow in a wide range of colours and patterns.

While the strange light show is not visible to humans, the ways fish absorb light, transform it and eject it as a different colour, is common among many species and is used to communicate and attract a mate.

The study, by the American Museum of Natural History is the first in-depth look at wide distribution of biofluorescence across fish that is invisible to the human eye.

Its findings could lead to the discovery of new fluorescent proteins that could be used in biomedical research, according to the study, which was published in the journal Plos One.

'We’ve long known about biofluorescence underwater in organisms like corals, jellyfish, and even in land animals like butterflies and parrots, but fish biofluorescence has been reported in only a few research publications,' said co-lead author John Sparks, a curator in the American Museum of Natural History’s Department of Ichthyology.

Researchers from the museum explained that fish live in a world that is predominantly blue because with depth, water quickly absorbs the majority of the visible light spectrum.

In recent years they have discovered that many fish absorb the remaining blue light and re-emit it in neon greens, reds, and oranges.

‘By designing scientific lighting that 
mimics the ocean’s light along with cameras that can capture the 
animals’ fluorescent light, we can now catch a glimpse of this hidden 
biofluorescent universe,’ said co-lead author David Gruber, an associate
 professor of biology at Baruch College and a research associate at the 
museum.

‘Many shallow reef inhabitants and fish have the capabilities to detect fluorescent light and may be using biofluorescence in similar fashions to how animals use bioluminescence, such as to find mates and to camouflage,’ he added.

The researchers’ investigations into fish biofluorescence began because they came across a show of green eel fluorescence off of Little Cayman Island while imaging coral biofluorescence for a museum exhibit.

To explore the phenomenon further, they were joined by scientists from three universities and photographers to capture images of fish in the waters of the Exumas in the Bahamas and the Solomon Islands.

They dived by night and stimulated biofluorescence in the fish with high-intensity blue light arrays housed in watertight cases. The resulting underwater light show was invisible to the human eye.

To record the show, the researchers used underwater cameras with yellow filters, which block out the blue light.

Their expeditions revealed a zoo of biofluorescent fish from sharks and rays to bony eels, especially those that were patterned and well camouflaged living in coral reefs.

The team discovered that many biofluorescent fish have yellow filters in their eyes, possibly allowing them to see the otherwise hidden fluorescent displays taking place in the water.

Although more research is needed, this finding indicates that biofluorescence could be used for interspecific communication while remaining camouflaged to predators.

This ability might be especially important during full moons, when fish have been shown to partake in mating rituals.

‘The cryptically patterned gobies, flatfishes, eels, and scorpionfishes - these are animals that you’d never normally see during a dive,’ Dr Sparks said.

‘To our eyes, they blend right into their environment. But to a fish that has a yellow intraocular filter, they must stick out like a sore thumb.’

Further study on the mechanics of the glowing fish could uncover new florescent proteins for use in experimental biology.

‘The discovery of green fluorescent protein in a hydrozoan jellyfish in the 1960s has provided a revolutionary tool for modern biologists, transforming our study of everything from the AIDS virus to the workings of the brain,’ Dr Gruber said.

‘This study suggests that fish biofluorescence might be another rich reservoir of new fluorescent proteins,’ he added.
