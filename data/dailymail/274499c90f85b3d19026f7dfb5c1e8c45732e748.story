‘X-wing’ spaceships instantly evoke scenes from Star Wars, but Elon Musk has just shown off real, functioning rocket fins in the iconic configuration.

The billionaire entrepreneur is testing 'hypersonic grid fins' that are designed to help control SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket as it re-enters the Earth’s atmosphere.

He has also showcased ‘drone ships’ that could one day be used as offshore landing pads for the reusable spacecraft.

 

 

The CEO of SpaceX revealed the features on Twitter, adding that testing for both futuristic technologies is currently underway.

The latest version of SpaceX’s reusable rocket sports a set of four fins that can be independently adjusted.

‘Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on re-entry for "X-wing" style control. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll,’ Mr Musk tweeted.

The X-shaped spacecraft in the Star Wars films were incredible maneuverable, allowing pilots such as Luke Skywalker to outclass the most skillful Imperial pilot.

Elon Musk wants to use satellites to provide internet access to remote parts of the planet.

He said to be involved in developing cheap and small satellites with expert Greg Wyler, of WorldVu Satellites.

The duo plan on launching 700 satellites which would be 10 times the size of the largest commercial fleet.

They would each weigh just 250lbs (113kg) - half the weight of the current lightest commercial offering.

The duo is considering opening a factory in Florida or Colorado to build their creations for a cost of at least $1 billion (£600 million).

Any satellites produced would likely be launched by Mr Musk’s firm SpaceX but there are many obstacles in the way.

The fins on the Falcon rocket deploy after take-off to prevent unnecessary drag and work alongside thrusters to enable the rocket to position itself correctly to land vertically, Space Daily reported. 

The entrepreneur likely made the X-wing reference because of the shape the fins make when spread out in four separate directions, plus because of their manoeuvrability.

They are similar to a set used on a test earlier this year, according to Mr Musk, who shared a video of that flight on the social network.

He also revealed details about the platform the rocket could land on.

Mr Musk is testing an ‘autonomous drone ship,’ that’s designed to be a safe platform for rockets to land on and refuel, away from densely populated cities.

He claims that the ship can maintain its position within 10ft (three metres) in the stormiest of conditions.

He tweeted: ‘Autonomous spaceport drone ship. Thrusters repurposed from deep sea oil rigs hold position within 3m even in a storm.’

As well as testing rocket fins and autonomous landing pads, Elon Musk (pictured) is said to be working on using an array of 1700 satellites to provide internet access to remote parts of the planet
