Fans desperate for pictures with the Tour de France cyclists are creating danger for riders by trying to take 'selfies' as they race past at 37mph.

Competitors have warned that spectators could get seriously hurt if they step into the road when they have their backs to the fast-moving peloton. 

Tejay van Garderen branded the craze ‘a dangerous mix of vanity and stupidity’ and appeared to be complaining on Twitter on Sunday night that he suffered a knee injury after a collision with a spectator.

While some spectators (such as this man pictured) made sure there was a clear distance between them and competitors, others were not so careful

While riders have said they appreciate the support, they have said that creeping nearer to the road to get a better shot is endangering both them and fans. The spectator pictured above keeps a safe distance from the riders.

‘Standing in the middle of the road with your back turned while 200 cyclists come at you, just to take a selfie. Think,’ said the American.

‘I love the crowds and thank you for your support. But please give us room. Gonna ice my knee now.’

His views were echoed by Team Sky rider and British Olympic gold medallist, Geraint Thomas.

‘It was dodgy at times,’ he said. ‘The worst thing is when people have got their backs to the peloton taking selfies.

‘Do
 that if you want but go sit in a tree. It’s the new pain in the a**e 
that’s for sure. People don’t understand how fast we go.’ Sir Dave 
Brailsford agreed.

‘British people are fantastic at supporting sport,’ he said. ‘But the riders were worried about safety.’

Support: Millions of fans lined the route as the tour began in Yorkshire but a few caused trouble

Concern: Some of the cyclists are worried at how close the crowds got on the narrow roads

Anywhere will do: Fans climbed walls and some even camped out to get pictures of the race

Britain’s Simon Yates, riding for Australia’s Orica GreenEDGE team, told the New York Post: 'The crowd support in England was amazing. The only real complaint was people taking selfies in the middle of the bunch and having their back to the peloton.

'Everyone is out there having fun and a lot of people don’t realize we’re coming past at 37 mph and we use every inch of the roads.'

One man who appeared to be taking a picture forced  Sky’s David Lopez Garcia to swerve wildly with four other riders crashing as a result. Among them was the unfortunate Simon Gerrans, who was the victim of Cavendish’s error on Saturday. 

Froome avoided any such issues, however, finishing safely in the pack and remaining just two seconds adrift of race leader Vincenzo Nibali.
