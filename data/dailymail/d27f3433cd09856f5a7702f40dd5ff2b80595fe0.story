QPR have asked about taking Juventus midfielder Mauricio Isla on loan. 

The Chile international, 26, can also play at right-back and his versatility will certainly appeal to manager Harry Redknapp.

Talks are expected to continue over the weekend but Rangers face competition from Fiorentina and Marseille among others who have expressed an interest.

Isla featured for Chile at the World Cup and has been with Juventus since 2012 after arriving from Serie A rivals Udinese.

Redknapp is also discussing a possible £4million deal for Cardiff midfielder Jordon Mutch. The 22-year-old was lined up by Sunderland but so far they have only offered £2.5m.

Redknapp has so far signed Steven Caulker from Cardiff and Rio Ferdinand on a free transfer after he was released by Manchester United.
