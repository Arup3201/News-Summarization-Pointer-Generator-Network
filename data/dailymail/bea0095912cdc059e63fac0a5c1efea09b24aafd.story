The mother of a three-year-old girl killed when a gust wind blew her buggy into the road is still too distressed to talk to police, an inquest heard today.

It was also revealed that the driver of a delivery van that hit Olivia Langley in Croydon, South London, was reversing at the time.Â 

Louise Uffindell left her daughter in her pushchair outside her front door for a matter of seconds to get something from inside and when she returned her daughter was on the road.

Despite her desperate efforts, nursery nurse Ms Uffindell was unable to revive her daughter.

Olivia's grandmother Debbie McClatchie said: 'She was very chatty very funny, very clever. She was such a lovely girl
I don't know how we're going to live without her'

Detective Sergeant Matt Austin, from 
the road death investigations unit at Catford, told the inquest the 
driver was arrested at the scene on suspicion of causing death by 
careless driving.

He said: 'The driver has given us an 
account saying he is very familiar with the area and very familiar with 
that particular block as he makes deliveries there quite regularly.

'He says he was driving slowly partly 
due to the fact the road is so poorly maintained. When he has his goods 
on board he doesn't want to damage them.

'He was in the process of reversing 
the vehicle when he felt some sort of bump or touch. He immediately 
stopped to get out of his driver's seat.

'That is when Olivia's mother has picked her up from the roadside and taken her straight into the hallway of the property.'

The court heard how Olivia's mother turned her back on the child for just a few seconds when the tragedy occurred.

DS Austin said: 'Olivia was in the buggy she was placed in the buggy by her mother outside her home address.

'We haven't been able to take a formal
account from the mother because she is in too much distress, this is 
what we have been told by the grandmother.

'Olivia was put into the buggy, Louise
turned around to get something from her kitchen work top and as she has
turned back around again to go out, the buggy has been blown by the 
wind into the road and she (Olivia) has then come into contact with a 
white Mercedes delivery van that was delivering parcels to an adjoining 
block.'

Olivia's mother was said to have let go of her pushchair for less than a second as she reached back inside her front door

The 36 year-old driver, who was 
travelling with a passenger, immediately stopped at the scene and police
and ambulance crews were called.

The inquest heard how a post mortem found that the three year-old died from a severe head injury.

But a second post mortem is set to be carried out after being requested by the drivers' solicitors.

Coroner Dr Roy Palmer asked for it to 
be carried out speedily so that the toddler's body can be released to 
her family to allow her funeral to be conducted.

He adjourned the inquest to a date yet
to be fixed, but is going to keep it under a review until a decision on
whether the driver will be charged has been made.

Olivia's grandmother, Debbie 
McClatchie, 49, said her daughter was devastated and blamed herself for 
the death of three-year-old.

Mrs McClatchie said that 
her daughter, Louise, had been considering moving out of the family home
because they lived so close to a busy road.

She said: 'She blames herself of course but it was a freak accident. I keep telling her no-one's to blame.

'She
just reached inside the door to pick something up and the wind just 
took the push chair. She's a nursery nurse and knows CPR so she tried to
revive her, she said to me: "Mum I did try".'

Mrs McClatchie added that the family does not know how it is going to live without their 'lovely girl.

She added: 'She was very chatty very funny, very clever. She was such a lovely girl
I don't know how we're going to live without her.

'She was thrilled to start 
nursery, she made us call it school because that's where the grown up 
children went and that's what she wanted to be.

'I've never been happy with her 
living there, it's a busy road and I didn't think she was very secure. 
We had spoken about her moving back nearer us but she's left it too 
late.'

Shocked neighbours said they were met with a horrific scene as they came outside amid the clamour of emergency vehicles.

One said Olivia's mother was screaming 'she's dead, she's dead' as she blew in her nose and administered CPR.

She
added: 'I came out after hearing some noises and saw the buggy which 
had been crushed. I saw the little girl and she looked like she was in a
bad way.

'Her mum was 
screaming. She said she had left her in her buggy outside her house for a
few moments while she went back inside to get something.

'She
said the wind had pushed the buggy over and a van has crashed into her.
It's so sad. They are a nice family. They've lived here for two years.'

Ongoing investigation: Police remove evidence from the flat where the girl lived. The driver of the van which hit her has been arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving

Mother-of-one
Sabrina Serrette, 33, said: 'Louise is lovely and her little girl was 
so beautiful. I have a two-year-old daughter and we've chatted about our
kids in the past.

'Her 
girl had gorgeous blonde hair, it was icicle white. Louise is a single 
mum and works for a daycare centre, the same one her little girl goes 
to.

'I am really shocked. It's so tragic. My heart goes out to Louise.'

William Messer, 72, said: 'I saw 
the helicopter touch down on the school playground behind the estate. 
There were lots of police cars and the road was cordoned off all 
morning. It's terrible.'

A London Ambulance Service spokesman 
added: 'We were called at just before 8.45am to reports of a road 
traffic collision on Wellesley Road.

'We sent a single responder in a car, an ambulance crew, a duty officer and London's Air Ambulance to the scene.

'Our staff treated one patient, a girl reported to be three-years-old, who was in cardiac arrest.

'She was taken to St George's Hospital in an ambulance, escorted by the doctor from the air ambulance.'

Delivery firm DPD confirmed to the Croydon Advertiser that one of its vehicles was involved in the incident.

'Our deepest sympathy goes to the family involved and we will continue to work closely with the emergency services investigating the incident,' a spokesman said.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The driver of the white Mercedes Sprinter panel van stopped at the scene.

'Officers from the Road Death Investigation Unit at Catford are investigating the circumstances of the collision.

'The 36-year old-driver was arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving and was taken to a south London police station.

'He has since been bailed to return pending further inquiries on a date in early May.'
