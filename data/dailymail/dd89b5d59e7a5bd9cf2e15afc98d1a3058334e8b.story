Many keep it as a precious memento of the best day of their lives. Some hold on to it to pass on to a daughter or niece. Others even wear it to renew their vows. 

Pauline Prescott’s wedding dress, on the other hand, ended up on the tip.

The wife of the former Deputy Prime Minister revealed that she was forced to dump the treasured gown after her husband grew tired of lugging it around during house moves.

Confessions: Former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Prescott and his wife Pauline gave a glimpse into their marital life in an appearance on All Star Mr And Mrs

And although it is almost five decades since the dress became landfill, it seems a touch of resentment remains, with Lady Prescott, 73, saying: ‘John has never kept his wedding suit. I wish he had so I could throw it on the tip.’

The couple made the confession – and a few others – to television presenter Phillip Schofield when they appeared on his show All Star Mr And Mrs last night.

Lord Prescott said he regretted disposing of the dress and had not realised its value at the time.

The 74-year-old explained: ‘When we got married she bought a wedding dress but she never told me how much it cost. At the time she told me she would turn it into a cocktail dress but she never did. ‘We also had this big box and we used to carry it from house to house. One day I said let’s get rid of it. She was pregnant at the time. So we went down to the corporation tip and we dumped it.

‘She never told me how much the wedding dress was but she has been going to those boutiques for years’.

The couple also admitted that another source of conflict between them is the kitchen. Lord Prescott said: ‘Pauline wishes I had two offices so I would not use her kitchen as an office. She always complains about that.

‘There was a time when Tony Blair rang up and she was banging the pots and pans in the kitchen and I said “Listen love, can you shut up, I am talking to Tony” and she said “This is my kitchen, not your office. And who is Tony?”

‘Tony Blair then came on the phone and said: “I heard that.”

‘I was trying to get Tony and  Gordon to agree and there she  was banging the plates. It was a crucial moment. She deliberately goes around banging plates so you can’t hear the phone.’

However, while the couple were quick to confess their more amusing marital conflicts in front of a studio audience on the ITV show, there was one bump in the road that did not get a mention.

In 2006, it emerged that Lord Prescott had carried out an affair with his glamorous secretary Tracey Temple, a divorcee 24 years his junior. The two-year fling began at an office Christmas party in 2002 after months of flirtation.

The pair continued secret trysts at the politician’s grace-and-favour flat in Whitehall and at Dorneywood, his 215-acre country retreat in Buckinghamshire, until 2004.

Last year, Lord Prescott said: ‘It was stupid. I’ve got no excuse really. People talk about mid-life crisis but I think it was part of an opportunity that developed.’

Though they have stayed together, in an interview last year Lady Prescott admitted she would never forgive her husband. The couple married in Chester in 1961 when Lord Prescott, 23, was a ship steward, and 22-year-old Lady Prescott worked as a hairdresser.

On last night’s programme, the Labour stalwart paid tribute to his wife, saying: ‘I could not have been successful without her. She always pinches the TV remote off me though. It’s 50 years and there is still mystery and surprise so long may that continue.’ In the show, one half of the couple is asked questions about their partner, while the other is taken to a separate booth, blindfolded and fitted with headphones to stop them hearing the answers.

When they return, they are asked the same questions – and have to give the same answer to score points and win money for charity.
