The cover for Harper Lee's new novel will surely remind you of the cover for her old one.

On Wednesday, HarperCollins unveiled the jacket art for Lee's Go Set a Watchman, the unexpected follow-up to her classic To Kill a Mockingbird.

The new cover, like the one for 1960's To Kill a Mockingbird, is a moody illustration featuring an oak tree in front. 

The art for Go Set a Watchman also shows train tracks and a train in the distance. 

In a statement released by HarperCollins, company President Michael Morrison noted that Go Set a Watchman begins with Mockingbird protagonist Scout Finch returning by train 20 years later, in the 1950s, to her native Alabama.

HarperCollins has announced a first printing of two million copies and a July 14 publication date. 

However the release of the book has been mired with controversy since the publisher confirmed it in February.

The announcement came just three months after the death of Lee's older sister, lawyer and gatekeeper, Alice Lee.

Harper and Alice Lee lived together at a nursing home in Monroeville, Alabama.

Alice was 103 when she died on November 17.

Lee once described her sister Alice as 'Atticus in a skirt', referring to her beloved Mockingbird character Atticus Finch, which is believed to have originally been inspired by the women's father.

Lee retreated into an intensely private life following the fame that To Kill A Mockingbird garnered her and repeatedly refused to publish another novel, maintaining her stance for over 50 years.

Some in Monroeville subsequently question whether the 88-year-old was capable of now consenting to the second novel's publication.  

A longtime friend came forward claiming Lee is mostly deaf, blind and in poor health.

Others questioned whether her mental health was sound enough to make such a decision.  

However, after launching an investigation, Alabama Securities Commission Director Joseph Borg said earlier this month his agency reviewed the matter at the Department of Human Resources' request, and that Lee answered questions to an investigator's satisfaction.

They have since closed the case.

A high-ranking state official said DHR opened its investigation after the second novel's announcement. 

The status of the DHR investigation was unclear. 

The official wasn't authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. 

The New York Times reported that investigators interviewed staff at The Meadows assisted living facility where Lee resides, as well as friends and acquaintances.

A doctor who asked to remain anonymous said he had filed a complaint after knowing Lee for two years and believing her infirm.

Investigation: Earlier this month, staff at The Meadows assisted living facility where Lee resides in Monroeville, Alabama, were interviewed to see if see was compos mentis 

He said he had been told she was mostly incapable of communication.

Such investigations can involve law enforcement if financial exploitation can be shown. 

One person speaking to The Times anonymously said Lee seemed to understand the investigators and give clear responses.

People have argued for several different pictures of Lee: funny, depressed, witty, confused, or even varying from day to day.

She reportedly had a stroke in 2007, resulting in health and vision problems. 

'It's a call only God or a doctor can make,' attorney Philip Sanchez, who was a pallbearer for older sister Alice's funeral, told the Times. 'I am more concerned that Nelle is content than the discussion of her cognizance.'

Accounts of Lee's mental and physical state have been contradictory over the last few years, but intensified recently after HarperCollins announced her second book, Go Set a Watchman 

A friend of Lee, Wayne Flynt, said he visited her recently and found her mentally cogent.

But he agreed she had some health issues, telling him 'I'm not so sure anymore', in response to a congratulations on the new book.

Lee has only given statements about the novel through her attorney, Tonja B. Carter. 

Carter handled the book deal and declined to respond to interview requests.

Lee wrote the book, Go Set A Watchman, in the 1950s.

It was first submitted to publishers before To Kill A Mockingbird and is considered her earliest work.

The manuscript was presumed lost, according to reports, but was found last year.

It centers around Mockingbird's protagonist, Scout, returning to Maycomb after 20 years.
