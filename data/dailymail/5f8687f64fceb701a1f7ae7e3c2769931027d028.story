Lionel Messi is used to being followed closely wherever he goes, but he may not have been ready for the reception he received in Beijing on Tuesday.

The Argentina star arrived with his squad for the 'Americas' Super Derby' against Brazil on Saturday.

And Messi was mobbed by hundreds of fans in China, along with Manchester United star Angel di Maria and Barcelona team-mate Neymar.
