In less than five years we could be live streaming images from Mars straight into our homes under plans to install a communications satellite on the Red Planet.

This would mean millions of eagle-eyed space enthusiasts could scour the live images for signs of alien life, or track changes in the weather, according to Bas Lansdrop, found of the Mars One project.

The satellite is part of the wider Mars One mission set to launch in January 2018 with a view to establishing a permanent human settlement on the planet within a decade.

The Mars One project needs to raise $400,000 (£245,000) by 25 January to fund its plans.

Once enough funding has been raised, the Dutch firm plans to launch a supply mission to land on Mars as 
soon as October 2016. 

A ‘settlement rover’ will then land in 2018.

The landing systems will be tested eight times before they are 
used to transport humans - a move that Mars One said will make the trips
 ‘much safer than moon missions’.

The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade.

Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days.

The £4bn project, founded in 2010 by 
engineer Bas Lansdorp, is set to recoup its costs by selling the 
broadcasting rights to the mission - by comparison, Nasa's rover Curiosity cost £1.8 billion.

The satellite will be built by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) - the company which was announced as one of the official partners of the plans just last week.

It will provide a 'high bandwidth communications system in a Mars synchronous orbit' and will be used to relay data and a live video feed from the lander on the surface of Mars back to Earth.

Mars One is said to have paid SSTL $60,000 (£36,00) to design what will be the first 'geostationary' satellite on the planet.

The Mars lander will then be built by Lockheed Martin.

This lander design will be based on the successful Mars lander used in the 2007 NASA Phoenix mission, which was also built and tested by Maryland-based firm. 

Speaking at a news conference last week, Mars One CEO Lansdorp said: 'Anyone with internet access will be able to see what the 
weather's like on Mars.'

The
 robotic mission to the Red Planet will launch in January 2018 - two 
years later than initially planned.

This unmanned mission is designed to explore and collect information about the planet with a view to launching a manned mission and setting up a Mars colony.  

Among those to make the first cut were 297 applicants from America. Hopefuls will be shortlisted into a final group of 40 before training begins. The robotic mission to the Red Planet will launch in January 2018 with plans to send a colony of humans to Mars by 2023. This illustration shows what the settlement would look like

The Dutch non-profit company has already gathered 
200,000 volunteers for this colony, and to help fund the project, Mars One launched an IndieGoGo 
crowd-funding campaign.

The project raised $10,000 (£6,121) in the first hour and
is currently at $78,000 (£47,600). The project is asking for a total of $400,000 (£245,000) and needs to raise this by 25 January.

A prison guard, a mother who home-schooled her children and a stand up comedian are among the 200,000 people from around the world who have applied to be among the first colonists on Mars.

The
 applicants have agreed to stay on the red planet for the rest of their 
lives - and be filmed for a reality TV programme.

 would vote for who should be on the first team of four to leave Earth 
in ten years’ time. By 2033 the colony would reach 20 settlers.

The
 hopefuls, who will be shortlisted into a group of 40 before their 
training starts, said why they would leave behind their loved ones and 
revealed what they would take in their suitcase if they were chosen.

By
 2015, the selected candidates will start an eight-year training regime 
where they will learn to deal with long periods of isolation.

In 2021 all the components of the settlement reach their destination in six separate landers. Two living units, two life support units, a second supply unit, and another rover arrive on Mars

The majority of applicants for the 
one-way trip to Mars came from the United States, with India 
and China coming in second and third place.

The second round will include an 
interview with Mars One committee members, and candidates advancing to 
the third round will compete against one another.

The
 third round will include a series of challenges to prepare candidates 
for the potential mission and will be broadcast on television and 
online.

The group said it aims to have a human settlement on Mars within a decade.

Journey time to Mars, which is approximately 40 million miles away depending on its position in orbit, would be around 200 days.
