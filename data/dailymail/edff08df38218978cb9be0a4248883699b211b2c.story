Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted spending £10,000 a time on portraits of politicians was 'chicken feed'

The huge bill for taxpayer-funded portraits of politicians has been dismissed as 'chicken feed' by a wealthy Tory MP.

Jacob Rees-Mogg, a member of the committee which commissions paintings, photographs and sculptures of MPs and peers, said the average £10,000 for each artwork was just a fraction of the overall cost of running Parliament.

He claimed many politicians are too 'shy and retiring' to sit for a portrait, but after a backlash against the £250,000 cost of portraits of the likes of Tony Blair, John Bercow and Diane Abbott, he admitted 'some are better than others'.

The
spending spree since 1995 included £11,750 for an apparently topless painting of Labour’s 
Diane Abbott – the same amount as was spent on a full-sized statue of 
Baroness Thatcher.

Other 
works include an £11,750 portrait of former foreign secretary Margaret 
Beckett, a £10,000 portrait of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan 
Smith, an £8,000 painting of Kenneth Clarke and a £4,000 oil painting of
 Foreign Secretary William Hague.

Labour left-wingers Tony Benn and Dennis Skinner had portraits commissioned which cost £2,000 and £2,180 respectively.

The
 bill for the artworks of two dozen politicians has been racked up since
 1995 and approved by the Speakers’ Advisory Committee on Works of Art. 

Today Mr Rees-Mogg, a former investment banker, sparked outrage as he defended the spending.

'I’m all for saving money, saving money right, left and centre, but this is chicken feed,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'It’s about £10,000 a year on administrative costs of the House of Commons of £200m. It hardly even ranks as chicken feed.'

But Labour MP Stephen Pound hit back: 'He must have some very well fed chickens!

'For a man who has his own personal portrait gallery, I suppose he has a different perspective. But to described that as chickenfeed shows someone who is more than a little out-of-touch,' he told the Evening Standard.

The huge sums were signed-off by the little-known committee of MPs which each year asks some of the 
country’s best portrait paintings to produce work of their colleagues.

Jacob Rees-Mogg is widely regarded as the poshest man in politics.

He cracks jokes in Latin, mixes quotes from Shakespeare's Henry V and children's TV show Bagpuss and once casually dropped the word ‘floccinaucinihilipilification’ into a debate on the pay of EU staff.

The 44-year-old son of late Times editor Lord William Rees-Mogg was elected MP for North East Somerset in 2010.

He read the Financial Times at the age of eight, and at 11 turned a £50 inheritance into £3,5000 on the stock market.

He once boasted that he would be ‘a millionaire at 20, a multi-millionaire at 40 and Prime Minister at 70, when I’ve made enough money to be able to afford to waste some on politics’.

He is observed with trashy US soap Dallas. Speaking in March last year he said the people he’d most like to meet are: ‘Margaret Thatcher, the Queen, Geoffrey Boycott and Larry Hagman, in that order.’

But he is perhaps better known for once campaigning with his Nanny in a Bentley when standing for election in Fife in 1997.

Except he denies it was a Bentley: 'Oh, no. That was wrong. Well, the Nanny bit is right. Of course she came canvassing; she’s part of the family after all — she’s been with us 47 years.

'But we took my mother’s Mercedes Estate. I don’t think a Bentley’s a suitable campaigning car. As much as anything it was the petrol consumption: six miles to the gallon,' he said last year.

But Mr Rees-Mogg insisted many senior politicians were reluctant to be the subject of artworks.

'You may be surprised to know that quite a number of people we think should be painted are very shy and retiring about it.

'You’d
 think politicians would be desperate to be immortalised for history, 
but actually we’re a more diffident lot than you might have thought.'

Some
 of the paintings have been mocked for their quality, including a 
portrait of Mr Blair with an over-large head and a striking image of 
Miss Abbott which is almost unreconisable.

Mr Rees-Mogg accepted the works vary in quality: 'As
 with all portrait painting, some are going to be better than others, 
but some are really very wonderful pieces of work when they are finally 
produced and will remain in the Houses of Parliament, perhaps, for a 
thousand years. And so it is an important part of our history.'

He added that the selection of some subjects was 'almost automatic' including former prime ministers, Commons Speakers and people 'who are the first to do things', including Miss Abbott, the first black woman elected to Parliament.

But far
 from recording only those who reach high office, it has also ordered 
works featuring left-wing firebrand Dennis Skinner, photographs of SNP 
MP Pete Wishart and a series of pictures have been taken of the 
committee themselves.

The 
House of Commons insisted it has moved to cut spending on portraits in 
recent years, but the details reveal the scale of the spending from 
records dating back to 1995.

And some MPs have recognised the sensitivity of spending money on art at a time of austerity: Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman agreed to sit for a portrait but withdrew in 2012 are questions were asked about the cost.

Three paintings commissioned to mark 
the 2001 election feature Mr Blair and his opponents, Tory leader 
William Hague and Lib Dem Charles Kennedy. The piece cost £6,000.

Mr Blair later for a separate portrait by Phil Hale, which was criticised for showing the Labour PM with an over-large head.

A
 painting of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith came cost 
£10,000, £8,000 for Minister Without Portfolio Kenneth Clarke and £4,000
 for Foreign Secretary William Hague.

The
 bill for Labour's Diane Abbott’s striking – apparently topless – 
portrait came to £11, - the same amount as was spent on a full-sized 
statue of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher.

A
 painting of long-serving backbencher Dennis Skinner cost £2,180 while 
Labour's Tony Benn and former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown both 
cost £2,000 and another of the party's former leaders, Sir Menzies 
Campbell, cost £10,346.

Jonathan
 Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ‘While the 
public might expect former prime ministers or speakers to be afforded 
the honour of a painting or bust in Parliament, it would certainly seem 
that the net is being cast increasingly wide when it comes to 
identifying subjects.

‘Regularly
 splashing out four or five-figure sums for these portraits has the 
whiff of an expensive vanity project, for which unwitting taxpayers are 
footing the bill.

‘When 
photographs are so much cheaper than paintings, politicians need to 
think twice about spending our money immortalising themselves or their 
friends on canvas, or even in bronze.’

A
 portrait of Commons Speaker John Bercow cost £22,000 to commission, 
with an extra £15,000 spent on a frame and coat of arms in keeping with 
other paintings in the Speaker's House.

Former Speaker Betty Boothroyd has been feature three times, in a £1,500 portrait in 1997, an £8,000 portrait in 1999 and a £9,000 bronze bust in 2000.

The costs were revealed by a Freedom of Information request by the Evening Standard.

Decisions on commissioning and buying art are made by the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art, a cross-party group that is currently chaired by Labour's Frank Doran.

From 1995 to 2000 just three MPs were chosen to be featured in a portrait, at an average cost of £3,375.

But from 2000-05, 11 parliamentarians were honoured at an average of £7,180. Between 2005 and 2010 there 10 commissions at an average of £9,300 each.

A House of Commons spokesman said: ‘The Parliamentary Art Collection at the House of Commons records those who have made a significant contribution to UK political life over the centuries and in each parliament the Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art endeavours to update this record by adding to the contemporary portrait collection.

‘In recent years the annual budget for acquiring works of art for the collection has been reduced to reflect the need for savings in the current economic downturn. This is part of the House's drive to reduce its overall cost by 17 per cent by 2014-15.’
