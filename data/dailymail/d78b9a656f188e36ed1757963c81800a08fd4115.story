With a globe of light illuminating each wingtip, and a fierce tongue of fire spouting from beneath, this hovering aircraft has been compared to an extraterrestrial visitor.

It is the latest test of the high-tech warplane that the U.S. and its allies are funding to maintain the West's aerial dominance far into the 21st century.

A video shows the Lockheed Martin F-35B Lightning II making its first night landing at sea, using its vertical landing capabilities to gently touch down on the deck of the USS Wasp.

The F-35B Lightning is the short take-off/vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the radar-evading Joint Strike Fighter - a collaborative development funded by the U.S. and eight of its major allies.

The jet combines advanced stealth features with fighter speed and agility, with its STOVL capabilities enabling it to operate from a wider range of ships.

The landing shown in the video was carried out by U.S. Marine Corps test pilot Lieutenant Colonel C.R. 'Jimi' Clift, a Harrier pilot by training.

'It all went extremely well,' he said. 'Eight successful landings in one night, so we’re tracking favorably along the learning curve.' 

During the 18-day long ship trials, which began on August 14, two F-35Bs were to conduct a series of tests to determine the aircraft’s suitability for sea-based operations.

They also included the first take-off and landing at sea by an RAF test pilot, Squadron Leader Jim Schofield, with the UK earmarking £250billion for a fleet of the jets due to be in operation by 2018.

Squadron Leader Schofield said: 'It's exciting to see the integration of this new plane with the amphibious assault ships.

'After
 a year leading up to this evolution, it's awesome to get here and 
start. And the crew has been especially accommodating and efficient at 
running these tests smoothly'

The movable afterburner at the rear of theF-35B means it is also able to take off from very short runways

Captain Erik Etz, Director of Test 
& Evaluation for the F-35 Naval Variants, added: 'It's a significant
 milestone for the F-35 programme.

'We're
 providing an envelope that will be utilised by Marine Corps and U.K. 
aviators when they go out and employ the aircraft in a real environment.

February 19: All F-35s grounded after crack found on low pressure turbine blade of Air Force variant warplane

January 16: Marine Corps' F-35B suspended for nearly one month after single engine failed during test flight in Florida

January, 2012: Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta took Marine Corps version of warplane off probation

August, 2011: Flight and ground operations suspended after electrical problems on Air Force aircraft

March, 2011: Fleet grounded after dual generator failure on Air Force test aircraft

January, 2011: Then Defense Secretary Robert Gates placed probation on warplane threatening to cancel fighter jet unless costs and problems were sorted within two years

'The ability to operate at night is critical and so certainly the testing we're doing here will provide a significant amount of data so we can clear the envelope and clear the aircraft to operate day and night, when the Marine Corps takes the F-35B to initial operating capability in 2015.'

Success in the latest round of tests is crucial in a weapons development programme which has been dogged with technical problems and demands on the Pentagon to slash costs.

After a year of pressure to revise its estimate of maintaining a fleet of more than 2,000 F-35s over 55 years, the agency finally caved in by slashing the number by more than 20 per cent, a move that could boost international support for the programme.

The new estimate of $857billion could help ensure the new plane turns out to be as affordable as advertised.

The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is the costliest weapons program in U.S. history. The Pentagon estimates it will cost $392billion to develop and build 2,443 of the new jets for use by the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.

Lockheed is developing three models of the radar-evading warplane for the U.S. and eight countries that are helping fund its development: Britain, Australia, Canada, Norway, Turkey, Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands.
