The principal of a Queensland primary school who banned handstands and cartwheels in the playground has been subjected to 'cowardly cyberattacks' by parents, the state education minister said.

Peregrian Springs State School parents were advised in a school newsletter in August that handstands, cartwheels and other 'cheerleading-style' stunts were not allowed unless children were under supervision of a trained physical education teacher.

Some parents and others in the school community were outraged by the ban, which critics said placed unnecessary restrictions on their children's play time.

Peregian Springs State School's decision top stop students from doing cartwheels and handstands without supervision has prompted 'cowardly cyberattacks' on principal Gwen Sands

Queensland Education Minister John-Paul Langrbroek told Parliament on Tuesday he stood by principal Gwen Sands' decision to impose the ban, which was made after two students were injured at school while doing 'gymnastic cheerleading' in the concrete playground.

'Gwen Sands was held up to ridicule by the media, pilloried internationally as a perpetrator of crimes against children and derided as the worst of the nanny state officials,' Mr Langrbroek told Parliament on Tuesday.

'But the most hurtful were the cowardly cyberattacks launched via Facebook and Twitter, many from parents of the students in her care,' he said. 'There were single lines and stinging rebukes sent without thought for the consequence or the power that words can have, even against adults.' 

These parents were the same people who expect schools to protect their children from bullies and who 'march straight into the principal's office demanding these measures for their children,' Mr Langrbroek said.

The handstand ban follow injuries to two students while doing 'gymnastic cheerleading' in the school's mostly concrete playground, Queensland Education Minister John Langrbroek said

'Do we now need to start a campaign to protect our teachers and principals from the very people who should know better, the parents of the children entrusted to their care?' Mr Langrbroek said.

'I spoke to principal Sands and I told her I had her back 100 per cent because I support our principals to make the right decisions for their communities.' 

The Queensland Department of Education has said it was up to the school to make individual decisions about activities in the playground.

Not all parents were unhappy with the decision.

Others took to Facebook to say they supported Dr. Sands and the school's commitment to the students' safety.
