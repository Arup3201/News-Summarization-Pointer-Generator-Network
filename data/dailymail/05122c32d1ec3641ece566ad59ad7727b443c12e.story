Senior MPs have called for Prince Andrew to stay away from a business conference in Switzerland amid controversy about his friendship with billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.

The prince usually attends the World Economic Forum in Davos, hosting private receptions and meetings.

But he is in the spotlight over toxic claims – which he has emphatically denied – that he had sexual relations with an under-age girl linked to Epstein.

Sir Menzies Campbell has suggested he may not be welcome at this year's conference, which runs from January 21 to 25.

'This is a time for discretion rather than distraction,' said the former Lib Dem leader. Katy Clark, Willie Bain and Ann McKechin, Labour MPs on the House of Commons business committee, are also said to have suggested he should stay away.

Meanwhile, other MPs have called for clarification over his globe-trotting to promote British business – and how it is funded.

The prince was forced to step down as an international trade envoy in 2011 after criticism that he was lavishing millions of pounds of public money on private jets and helicopters.

His resignation also came after photographs emerged of the prince and Epstein walking together in New York after the financier had been released from jail for grooming under-age girls for sex.

But despite losing his envoy title, Andrew still travels around the world promoting British business and undertook 90 overseas trips last year, including to India, Saudi Arabia, and China.

While some of this travel costs were met by the taxpayer, other trips were in a private capacity, raising questions as to who is funding the prince.

Yesterday, Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi said Prince Andrew did an excellent job of promoting British business through his contacts and should not be discouraged from attending Davos. 

He said: 'It is a very important job. When I have spoken to ambassadors for the Middle East and elsewhere in the world, they say that what he does for UK Plc is invaluable.

'If it is true Labour MPs are calling for him not to attend, then it is trial by Labour.

'The palace has said he has done nothing wrong and have categorically denied the allegations.'

Royal aides have previously said that his trips to Davos are 'an opportunity to engage with and learn from some of the biggest names in the global economy'.

They said he also uses the event to encourage chief executives to help young people acquire skills through apprenticeships and mentoring.
