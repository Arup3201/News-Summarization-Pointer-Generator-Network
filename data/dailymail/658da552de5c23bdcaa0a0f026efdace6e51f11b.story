A top model has accused a little known beauty brand of damaging her career because it used an 'unauthorised' photo of her for one of its ads.

Yuliana Bondar, who has walked the runway for Vera Wang and Marc Jacobs, has filed a suit in a Manhattan federal court over claims that a photographer 'secretly sold her image'.

The Ukranian-born 24-year-old is seeking $25million after it went on to appear in a campaign for beauty firm LASplash Cosmetics.

According to the New York Post, she believes that being 'the face' of the brand is having a negative impact on her future.

The suit explains that photographer David Byun originally shot Miss Bondar in a SoHo studio in 2010.

He maintains that 'everything was legal' with regards to the usage rights of the photograph.

Miss Bondar is signed to the New York branch of IMG Models, the agency that represents Chanel Iman, Lara Stone and Miranda Kerr in the U.S.

She made the biggest impact 
on the industry in early 2007, when she walked the catwalk for the 
aforementioned labels, as well as Anne Klein, BCBG Max Azria, and Tracy 
Reese.

Last year, she 
walked for Marchesa and Tory Burch, but the most recent fashion week 
only saw her appear on the catwalk for Chadwick Bell, according to 
FashionModelDirectory.com.

Miss Bondar also continues to do high-profile editorial and campaign work, though and appeared in the pages of Grazia magazine last year.

She was also among the models in the H by Halston spring/summer ads, and more recently in the lookbook for the MaxMara Atelier fall/winter 2012 collection.
