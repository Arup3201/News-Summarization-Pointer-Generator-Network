Retired Stoke Mandeville consultant Dr Michael Salmon, 79, is accused of a total of 16 charges, all of which he denies

A retired hospital consultant has denied charges that he tried to arrange abortions for a young girl patient he is already accused of raping.

Dr Michael Salmon, 79, from Salisbury, Wiltshire, appeared before a judge at Reading Crown Court to plead not guilty to two charges of procuring an abortion for the same girl.

The offences are alleged to have happened on separate occasions between July 1984 and July 1985. 

The claims, made by a total of eight alleged victims, related to when Salmon was a consultant at Stoke Mandeville Hospital and the Royal Buckingham Hospital, both in Buckinghamshire, in the 1980s.

Well-spoken Salmon addressed the court only to confirm his name and enter a not guilty plea to each of the charges, including the two latest abortion charges which were put to him yesterday.

The former doctor, who is married, was allowed to sit in the courtroom behind his barrister for the short hearing because of problems with the hearing loop in the dock.

The retired consultant listened intently as Rachel Drake, prosecuting, and Sarah Jones, defending, made plans for his case to progress.

In total Salmon entered not guilty pleas to three counts of rape, 11 counts of indecent assault and two counts of using an instrument with the intention of procuring a miscarriage.

Judge Joanne Cutts QC said that his trial would take place on January 5 next year. 

A pre-trial review was also scheduled for November 28.

The judge told white-haired Salmon, who appeared in court yesterday wearing a suit, he was allowed to leave the court on conditional bail.
