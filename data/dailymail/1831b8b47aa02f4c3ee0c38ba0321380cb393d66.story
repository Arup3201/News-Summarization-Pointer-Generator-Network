Dredgers clearing the flooded Somerset Levels have recovered eight abandoned vehicles from a river - with some of them thought to have been stuck there for decades.

Workmen spotted the cars in King's Sedgemoor flood drain near Bridgwater in Somerset while clearing rivers that flooded during the heaviest January rainfall in 250 years - forcing thousands to flee their homes.

Although the eight cars were found in a flood drain less than 350 feet apart, Environment Agency officials were quick to dismiss suggestions that the vehicles could have impacted on the flooding.

Wreck: Workers in the process of clearing the flooded Somerset Levels recovered eight cars from a drain. It is thought some of the vehicles may have been there for at least 20 years

Not the cause: Although the eight cars were found in a flood drain less than 350 feet apart, Environment Agency officials were quick to dismiss suggestions that the vehicles could have impacted on the flooding

Blockage: Workmen spotted the old cars in King's Sedgemoor flood drain near Bridgwater in Somerset while clearing rivers that flooded during the heaviest January rainfall in 250 years

Loss: Thousands were forced to abandon their homes during the flooding in Somerset earlier this year. Many parked vehicles were completely submerged by the rising waters

Environment Agency officers said that 
while it was unclear how the cars got into the drain, it was very 
unlikely they were swept in by recent flood water.

Some of the vehicles were more than 20 years old and their condition and the water wildlife inhabiting them suggests some could have been stuck in the drain for decades.

Avon and Somerset Police were called in relation to the discovery of the vehicles.

John Rowlands, from the Environment Agency, said: 'Some of them are over 20-years-old, they certainly would not pass a MOT.'

'They
 range from a Ford Escort, to a Ford Fiesta and a Vauxhall Cavalier. The
 area around where the cars were located has a car parking area.'

The water channel is used to help drain the surrounding peat moors and is intended to bring some relief from flooding in the area

Before: This photograph was taken on the Somerset Levels in January and shows huge expanses of land under several feet of water

And after: The same area seen three months later. Millions of tonnes of water have been removed by enormous water pumps brought over from the Netherlands

'There is an access track there, so it is easily accessible should somebody want to do something underhand with a vehicle,' Mr Rowlands added.

The cars were spotted after water levels in the area dropped significantly following the flooding.

In total eight cars were pulled out near Bawdrip - each with a number of healthy eels inside.

Thanks
 to enormous water pumps from the Netherlands removing millions of 
tonnes of water from the land, large sections of the Somerset Levels are
 now dry.

This has allowed long-awaited dredging to begin on silt-laden 
rivers in the area.

Underway: The dredging is part of a £5.8million plan to clear a five mile stretch of the Tone and Parrett rivers. It got underway last Monday - just a day before a deadline imposed by David Cameron

The dredging is part of a £5.8million plan to clear a five mile stretch of the nearby Tone and Parrett rivers, with the project getting underway last Monday - just a day before a deadline imposed by David Cameron.

The dredging project will see 
engineers remove tonnes of sediment from the rivers, which has built up 
since clearing stopped 18 years ago.

It
 is hoped removing the sediment will increase the capacity of the 
rivers, which have been operating at just 60 per cent in places, and 
reduce the risk of them overflowing during the next period of heavy 
rainfall.
