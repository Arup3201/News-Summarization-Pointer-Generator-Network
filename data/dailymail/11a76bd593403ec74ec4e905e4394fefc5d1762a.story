The future of the world's timekeeping could be set to change if a U.S. led coalition is able to force through a proposal to abolish the leap seconds that keep clocks in line with the Earth's rotation.

Currently an extra second is added every few years to keep the time measured by atomic clocks synchronised with time as measured by the position of the sun in the sky.

But there are now calls for these leap seconds to be abolished in favour of a man-made standard of time some say is more precise in an electronic age.

Delegates to the International Telecommunication Union  have set their alarms for the beginning of a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, this afternoon where the proposals will be debated.

Under threat: The U.S. wants to move to a new man-made standard of time that disregards the position of the sun in the sky, rendering sundials useless

Opponents, including experts from the UK and China, say such a change would mean time shifting out of sync with people's everyday experience of night and day.

David Willetts, Minister of State for Universities and Science, told the BBC: 'The UK position is that we should stick to the current system used throughout the world.

'Without leap seconds we will eventually lose the link between time and people's everyday experience of day and night.'

Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) has, since the Seventies, been the agreed universal standard which dictates what time it is in every time zone on the planet.

UTC is kept by averaging the time from 400 atomic clocks on earth and sometimes differs from time dictated by day and night, due to fluctuations in earth's rotation.

Atomic clocks measure time to incredibly precise accuracy by measuring vibrations caused by the decay of radioactive particles to count the seconds.

The speed of the Earth's rotation varies, however, meaning that while one rotation is one day, some days are a few milliseconds longer or shorter than others.

Scientists allow for these fluctuations by adding leap seconds roughly every year-and-a-half to keep UTC synchronised with our traditional, sun-based concept of time.

They are added once the International Earth Rotation Service, which monitors the planet's activity, finds the two measurements of time have drifted apart by 0.9 seconds.

Outdated: Supporters of the reforms say that a man-made absolute time system would be more useful in an age of GPS and electronic communication

But that tiny difference could be disastrous, according to Dr Felicitas Arias, head of the time department at International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris.

The France-based bureau aggregates the readings from atomic clocks worldwide and issues the results to timekeepers around the world.

Dr Arias told the New Scientist last month: 'It is vital for global navigation satellite systems such as GPS to have a continuous time scale, not UTC with its leap seconds.

'That means there is a 15-second difference between UTC and the time GPS uses. Someone who is unaware of this could make a tragic mistake when landing an aircraft, for instance. This could happen.'

'And a one-second difference in the communication between stock exchanges could provoke a gain or loss of millions of dollars.'

But supporters of leap seconds, like Peter Whibberley, senior researcher in time and frequency at the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, say the problems they cause do not justify getting rid of them.

He told the BBC abolishing them would be 'perhaps the most fundamental change to timekeeping for hundreds of years.'

'For the first time, civil time worldwide would be based purely on man-made clocks and no longer tied closely to the Earth's rotation,' he said.

Intuitive: The position in the sun in the sky has, for millenia, been mankind's established method of determining the time

As a result of such a discrepancy in just a few decades the difference between Earth-based time and atomic clock time would amount to several minutes.

Over 500 years the two standards of time would be out by as much as an hour. Over millenia, the discrepancy could grow to such an extent midday would fall in the middle of the night.

It is not the first time the U.S. has campaigned against leap seconds. In 2005 American experts proposed that they be replaced with a leap hour, but ITU members rejected the plan.

If agreement over the time keeping proposal cannot be reached among the ITU's 200 member states, the issue will go to a vote.

A 70 per cent majority would be needed for leap seconds to be abolished. If they are, the change would come into force from January 1, 2018.

â–ˆ The UK's atomic clock, based at the National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, has been judged to be the most accurate in the world.

U.S. researchers from Pennsyvania State University last summer found it wouldn't stray by more than a second in 138million years.
