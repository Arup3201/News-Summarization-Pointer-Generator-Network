The Duke of Cambridge looked a little lost as he tried out his skills in a volleyball skills training session on Wednesday.

William joked with youngsters as he tried to work out where he was 
meant to be and to whom he should throw the ball during the morning session in 
west London, with one 13-year-old saying that he 'felt sorry' for the future king for being unable to return his balls.

His 
foray into the sport comes just months after his wife, the Duchess of 
Cambridge, hit the headlines when she revealed her post-baby figure in a
 midriff top and skinny jeans while playing volleyball at a similar 
event for Sports Aid.

The Duke of Cambridge looked a little lost as he tried out his skills in a volleyball skills training session on Wednesday a few weeks after his wife Kate wowed in skinny jeans and high heels playing volleyball at an event for Sports Aid

The Duke took part in a volleyball game at the Westway Sports Centre in north Kensington, London, today while visiting young apprentice sports coaches taking part in a mentoring programme he helped to create.

William started off shakily during a coaching skills session in which he spent most of his time on court looking around to see where he was meant to be and to whom he should be passing the ball.

But Greg Mateo, a mentor helping the apprentices run the drill, said the Duke quickly found his stride.

'He
 came in late, but he adapted very quickly,' Mr Mateo said. 'I think we 
were all confused initially, but part of the objective is to have 
confusion and work through that confusion and I think he was able to do 
that pretty well.'Â

William then tried his skills in a volleyball game, where serving the ball over the net seemed to be his strength.

He was also adept at spiking the ball over. But the royal visitor appeared to meet his match when trying to return the serve of 13-year-old Vinojh Kalaiselvan.

The
 Duke tried to dig the ball on the first occasion but missed and then 
let the ball practically land at his feet when the pint-sized 
volleyballer served again.

After the first miss, a still buoyant William kept up the talk with his team-mates, shouting: 'Sorry, my bad.' Vinojh
 joked afterwards: 'I felt a bit sorry for him. But it was a very good 
game, he did well. 'I was nervous playing because I had never met the 
Prince before.'

Vinojh said
 while his serving prowess against William would make a great story for 
his friends, he was happy to offer some advice.

'I think it was his first time playing, so if he practises and practises, he'll get better,' he said.

Royal trio William, Kate and Harry launched the programme in July last year - a day before the 
London Olympics. It provides an intense training programme for 16 to 
24-year-olds, many from disadvantaged social backgrounds, to become 
qualified sports coaches and inspire their peers.

William
 met Coach Core's advisory board and young apprentices from pilot 
programmes in London and Glasgow, run through organisations Greenhouse 
and Glasgow Life.

He also met apprentices from partner project RBI Harlem, which is supported by The American Friends of The Royal Foundation.

William
 then watched the apprentices running basketball and volleyball coaching
 sessions before having a go at being coached in the volleyball session 
himself.

Apprentice volleyball coach Rakeem Caesar, 18, said he was excited to have met the Duke.

He said his life was taking a turn for the worse before he became involved in sports.

'When I was younger I was defensive, I used to get angry and would get into arguments with other pupils,' he said.

'If a teacher got involved I wouldn't care, I would feel really mad.'

Mr
 Caesar said that after meeting an inspiring coach who encouraged him to
 play volleyball, he was able to challenge his anger and let off steam.

He now hopes to be a similar role model for other young people.

'I've become more confident and I'm able to use my dedication to the sport to help younger pupils at my school.'

Tracy Simpson, also 18, said the Coach Core programme has helped her control her rage as well.

As a table tennis coach, she said she now had respect and a focus for her life.

'I
 know a few other children who have issues similar to mine when I was 
younger so I have tried to find ways to help them through their issues,'
 she said.

'I want to help 
someone to improve their developmental skills and their personal life as
 well to help them be the best person they can be.'

Coach Core Advisory Board member Owen Slot said Ms Simpson's attitude typified the aim of the programme.

'Tracey Simpson is one of the most inspirational young people I have ever met,' he said.

'She has overcome anger issues that were once so bad that, in a fit of rage, she damaged her playing hand.'

Glasgow Life project director David Bickley said the programme was about helping the apprentices with employment and social issues.

'We often provide support that they wouldn't get in their home lives,' he said.

The current crop of London-based apprentice coaches are expected to graduate after Christmas.
