The judge who cleared Amanda Knox of killing Meredith Kerchner has hit out at his colleagues who overturned the decision, saying they were 'violating the law'.

Claudio Pratillo Hellmann acquitted Knox, 26, and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, 29, of murdering the British student in 2011 after they had initially been found guilty and sentenced to 26 and 25 years jail respectively.

However, three months ago the Italian Supreme Court overruled that decision, saying that key evidence had been overlooked, and a fresh trial is expected to begin in the autumn.

Judge: Claudio Pratillo Hellmann, who overturned Knox's sentence, has criticised the Italian Supreme Court for ordering the American to undergo a fresh murder trial

In a furious attack Mr Hellmann, who has now retired as a judge, slammed the ruling in an interview with glossy Italian weekly Oggi.

'The Supreme Court judges in effect carried out a straight-legged tackle,' he said. They cannot do that and they should not have done that. They should have just limited themselves to the law.

'Instead they decided to interpret the evidence and that is a violation of the law. That is incorrect. What they have done is in effect hand the new trial a sentence that is ready and done - their ruling has explained to the judges in the new trial how they should convict the two accused.'

In their ruling, the Supreme Court reverted to the original 2009 trial verdict that said Meredith had been killed by more than one person in a 'sex game gone wrong', claiming the acquittal two years later contained 'deficiencies, contradictions and illogical' conclusions.

Relief: Knox after her acquittal in 2011; she now faces a retrial but is unlikely to return to the court in Italy

Ivory Coast drifter Rudy Guede was convicted of the murder and sexual assault of Meredith in 2009 and is now serving a 16-year sentence, reduced from 30 on appeal. He could be freed as early as 2014.

Mr Hellmann said: 'The theory of a sex game gone wrong doesn't add up - in that small room where Meredith was killed after a struggle and supposedly a sex game gone wrong, maybe even an orgy, there was no biological trace of Knox and Sollecito - it would have been impossible for them to get rid of their traces and leave that of Guede.'

He added that he was 'still convinced' he had made the right decision in freeing Knox and Sollecito - who were pictured last week warmly embracing in New York - and added: 'I am still convinced that I did my duty. I'm happy because I avoided an unjust jailing.Â 

'Italy is a country that convicts where there is proof beyond all reasonable doubt. In this case there were only slim possibilities that they were both involved, and when you hold a trial you are not playing the lottery.'

But in a press conference in Perugia, where Meredith was murdered in 2007, chief prosecutor Giovanni Galati insisted that the retrial would give fresh hope to the Croydon-born student's family.

He said: 'This has become an unworthy soap opera and only Rudy Guede, Amanda and Raffaele can tell us what really happened on the night of November 1, 2007. The appeal court judges lost their way - they didn't take into account anything from the first trial because they wanted to confirm their innocence.

'The Supreme Court has overruled the appeal court's decision that there had been contamination of evidence. The new trial will bring justice and, in the case of a conviction, a new sentence. It gives fresh hope to the family of the student so they can know what happened to her.'

Knox is not expected to return to Italy voluntarily for the retrial, and the U.S. is extremely unlikely to extradite her to Europe.

She recently published a memoir, entitled Waiting to Be Heard, in which she protested her innocence and described the ordeal of spending two years in an Italian prison, where she says she was sexually harassed by guards and fellow inmates.

Sollecito's father Francesco said: 'It is evident that sentences should be respected - and above all those of the Supreme Court.

'However, here we find it impossible to agree because there are serious inaccuracies in the judgement and they have no idea of the evidence.

'What judge Hellmann is saying is that the Supreme Court has in effect returned a third verdict which it should not have and which is forbidden by law.'

Last week Sollecito launched an online appeal for $500,000 to help fund his new trial, and the total now stands at $10,000.
