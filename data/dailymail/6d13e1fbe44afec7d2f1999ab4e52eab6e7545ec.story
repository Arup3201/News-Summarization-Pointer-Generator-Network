David Cameron is to meet families of the British victims of the Malaysian Airlines flight shot down over Ukraine to discuss their 'tragic loss'.

The Prime Minister is expected to invite grieving relatives of the 10 Britons killed in the disaster to a private meeting in Downing Street later this week.

It follows warnings that the bereaved have been left ‘totally bewildered’ by their loss, including it taking four days for the bodies of the 298 people killed to start being moved from eastern Ukraine.

Prime Minister David Cameron is to hold a meeting with families of Britons killed when MH17 was shot down over Ukraine

All 298 people on board the plane from the Netherlands to Malaysia were killed, including 10 Britons, and 193 Dutch citizens.

Mr Cameron had said the priority was retrieving the bodies of those killed and securing the site for accident investigators.

The process has been hampered by masked and armed pro-separatist militiamen, backed by Russia.

Finally today a train carrying the bodies of 282 victims arrived in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv after the pro-Russian rebels agreed to release them.

Dutch investigators leading a probe into the disaster were waiting to take charge of the bodies.

From there, they will be put on planes - including a Dutch C130 Hercules and an Australian C-17 Globemaster - back to the Netherlands, where the doomed flight to Kuala Lumpur took off.

Yesterday Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott revealed he had begun contacting the families of the 37 Australians killed in the MH17 disaster, adding that the families may never come to terms with their loss.

'These are families in very difficult circumstances, numb with grief and only beginning to come to terms with their loss,' he said.

'I don't want to cause anyone any individual grief but I want them to know the Prime Minister is available to them at any time.'

Now Mr Cameron is expected to do the same. ‘I certainly am available to have a meeting with their families and talk to them about all the concerns they have,’ Mr Cameron said.

Downing Street said the Prime Minister would meet with any of the families if it would help them to do so.

A meeting with some or all of the families could be held before the end of this week.

Yesterday Keith Vaz, the Labour chairman of the home affairs select committee, urged Mr Cameron to ‘see the relatives of the British victims as quickly as possible, as they must be not only grief stricken but totally bewildered about what is happening’. 

Speaking in the Commons yesterday, Mr Cameron said: 'Alongside sympathy for the victims, there is anger. 

'There is anger that this could happen at all; there is anger that the murder of innocent men, women and children has been compounded by sickening reports of looting of victims’ possessions and interference with the evidence; and there is rightly anger that a conflict that could have been curtailed by Moscow has instead been fomented by Moscow.'
