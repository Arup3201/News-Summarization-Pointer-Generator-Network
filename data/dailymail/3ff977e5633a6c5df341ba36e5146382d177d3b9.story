A Tiger Airways flight from Cairns to Melbourne has been forced to make an unscheduled landing after it was hit by a bird.

Flight TT585 was forced to divert to Brisbane Airport after a ‘bird strike’ for the safety of the passengers.

Tiger spokesperson Simon Murphy told Daily Mail Australia that this ‘is not an emergency and bird strikes are a fairly regular occurrence with all airlines.’

It is Tiger Airways procedure that the flight must immediately land and undergo assessment from an engineer following a bird strike.

The flight left Cairns at 10am and was due to arrive in Melbourne at 2pm

'No issue was reported by the captain but when the plane lands it will be assessed by an engineer before the flight continues on to Melbourne this afternoon.'

The flight left Cairns at 10am and was due to arrive in Melbourne at 2pm.

The plane was delayed for around three hours, leaving at 2.05pm local time. 

They are scheduled to land at 5.25pm, 'in plenty of time for New Year's Eve.'

'These things happen but safety is always the priority.' 

In August this year, a Tiger Airways flight from Singapore to Trichy was forced to land when the Airbus A320 was hit by a bird; damaging the windscreen and creating a pressure imbalance during the landing.

In 2010 a Tiger Airways flight from Brisbane to Rockhampton returned to Brisbane after it was struck by a bird.

Passengers were forced to wait eight hours at the airport until the flight could take off again.
