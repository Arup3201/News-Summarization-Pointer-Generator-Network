When the two teams walk out of the Huish Park tunnel on Sunday afternoon there will be one amongst them wearing a Manchester United kit under his Yeovil Town garbs.

Ten-year-old Harris, a United fan, was handed a late Christmas present by his father, Yeovil striker James Hayter, when he was told he had got him a place as a home mascot in their FA Cup third-round tie.

The fixture is one of the biggest in Yeovil's history and Hayter admits, at 35-years-old, that it will be the greatest in his long career as a forward.

But there was one in the Hayter household who celebrated even more than the player when Louis Van Gaal's team were pulled out of the hat to play the Somerset side.

'Harris said he wants to wear his Manchester United kit under his Yeovil kit,' Hayter explained. 'He was buzzing about the draw.

'I only told him on Tuesday he was going to get to be a mascot as well. So it's even better he's going to get to shake hands with all the players. He just can't wait for the game.'

Harris's favourite player is Wayne Rooney and though Hayter draws the line at asking for the England striker's shirt at half-time, he added: 'He's asked me if I can try and get something off him. I'll do my best. Harris might be asking it before the game in the tunnel when he's lining up. It will be a good day for him.'

Hayter's wife and two younger daughters will be at Yeovil's home for the game, although his parents, Mary and Richard, are unable to attend.

They famously missed the moment their son scored the fastest hat-trick in Football League history, his first match after Harris was born a decade ago. 

Hayter, playing for Bournemouth at the time, came from the bench in the 84th minute in a match against Wrexham at Dean Court in February 2004, scored with his first touch and netted twice more within 140 seconds. But his parents had left the ground early to catch a ferry back to their home in the Isle of Wight.

'They were listening to the radio on the way back,' Hayter said. 'They heard a cheer on the way out and put the radio on and heard it was mine and were annoyed. Then listened in the car on the way to the ferry and heard I scored another two. They were obviously pleased, but they'd left to get the earlier ferry. They still shake their heads about it.'

His father is too unwell to travel to the match, but they will be watching back home on television, eager not to miss this one.

Hayter spent a large part of his career at Bournemouth, on their books as a teenager before enjoying a decade on the south coast between 1997 and 2007.

While there, he heard stories about Bournemouth's famous victory against United, under manager Harry Rednapp, to knock them out of the cup in 1984. Hayter was only five at the time.

Yet Yeovil have an even richer history of giant killing, knocking out 17 professional sides when they were a non-League club.

'It is something the manager Gary Johnson has spoken to us about in the previous two rounds,' Hayter added. 'He said that this was almost what Yeovil was known for.

'People know about Yeovil as they did so well in the FA Cup as a non-League team and they are one of the teams that has knocked the most league teams out. This club has a real history in the FA Cup.'

Victory for the League One team against this United side, worth hundreds of millions of pounds, will be perhaps mark their greatest moment of all. Everyone in a Yeovil shirt will be celebrating wildly, apart from a young boy with his Manchester United kit on underneath.
