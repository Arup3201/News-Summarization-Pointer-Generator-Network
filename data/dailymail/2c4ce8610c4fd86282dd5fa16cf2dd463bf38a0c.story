They have long been known to be bright, friendly and intelligent creatures.

Now it seems they might also be lifesavers, because for the first time dolphins have been spotted teaming up to try to rescue an injured group member.

The amazing footage, filmed at Kyum Park of the Cetacean Research Institute in Ulsan, South Korea, shows 12 dolphins swimming very close together when one of their number gets into difficulty.

The female long beeked common dolphin wriggles and tips from side to side, turning upside-down while her pectoral flippers seem to be paralysed.

Instantly the other dolphins crowd around her, diving beneath as they try to keep her afloat.

Half an hour later and the dolphins have formed into a raft by swimming side by side with the injured female on their backs as they try to stop her from drowning.

Sadly, after another few minutes some of the helper dolphins left, and the injured female soon dropped into a vertical position.

Despite the best efforts of the remaining helpers, who appear to try and prop her up, keeping her head above the surface, she soon stopped breathing.

According to the researchers who filmed the pod of dolphins, five of the creatures stayed with it and continued touching its body, until it sank out of sight.

The dolphins move into help the troubled female and within half an hour they have grouped together in what appears to be an effort to save her life

Soon the creatures have formed a raft around their stricken pal as they try to keep her above water

Sadly, the pod were unable to save the creature and she slipped below water and out of sight

Karen McComb at the University of Sussex in Brighton told the New Scientist: 'It does look like quite a sophisticated way of keeping the companion up in the water.

'It makes a lot of sense in a highly intelligent and social animal for there to be support of an injured animal.'

But Ms McComb said while the images suggested the dolphins understand when others are suffering, and can even empathise, the dolphins could have been trying to keep their group member alive to retain control of their territory.

There have been examples of single dolphins helping others, generally mothers helping their calves, but no cases of groups of dolphins working together to help another.

Dolphins are also believed to mourn their dead, after researchers witnessed them interacting with the corpses of dead group members.
