A 14-year-old girl has died after being struck by a train on a foot crossing, where four other people have been killed in the last five years.

The teenager, who has been named locally as Sacha Wheeler, was killed after being hit by a train at a railway crossing near Whitstable station in Kent on Sunday.

The girl's next of kin have been informed of the incident and police said they are not treating the death as suspicious.

British Transport Police said a file would now be passed to the coroner. 

Tributes have been paid to Sacha, who was a Year 9 pupil at Simon Langton Girls' Grammar School in Canterbury.

One friend, called Ellie, wrote on Twitter: 'I miss her so much already. I will never be okay with this.

'RIP Sacha my best friend, you are way too f****** young I love you man x.'

Another added: 'This was a tragic accident, my thoughts go out to Sacha's friends and family at this time.'

On Facebook, a close friend called Josh Wood, wrote: 'Rest in peace. You was (sic) such a pretty nice girl always laughing and smiling. Always cheered me up when I was down. 

'You will be truly missed by everyone. I'll love you always. Gonna be a hard time without you being here (sic).' 

In a statement released today, Simon Langton Girls' Grammar School headteacher Jane Robinson also paid tribute to Sacha.

She said: 'We were deeply saddened to learn of the death of one our pupils. 

'Our whole school community is deeply shocked by Sacha’s tragic accident, and our hearts go out to her family.

'So many of the girls have come in with flowers today as a tribute to Sacha, and have written messages on her memory tree. 

'She was a great asset to our school and will be sadly missed by us all.

'We have been supporting her classmates today and counselling is being offered to those who need it.'

Floral tributes have also been left at the scene of the incident, with one saying: 'We love you Sacha, you will be missed.'

Another added: 'You were not known to us, but in passing, you have touched the deepest part of souls forever, rest in peace.' 

Heartfelt floral tributes have been left at the scene of the incident, which occurred at about 6pm on Sunday

One tribute, believed to be from a pupil at Simon Langton Boys' Grammar School, said: 'We love you Sacha'

Another tribute left by a couple unknown to Sacha said: 'You have touched the deepest part of souls forever'

The circumstances surrounding the teenager's death have not yet been confirmed.

A British Transport Police spokesman said: 'Our officers were called to [the] foot crossing, near Whitstable station, at 6pm on Sunday after reports a person had been struck by a train.

'Colleagues from Kent Police and South East Coast Ambulance Service also attended, but a 14-year-old girl was pronounced dead at the scene. Her family has been informed.

'We are not treating the death as suspicious, but we will prepare a file for the coroner.'

There have been four deaths at the pedestrian railway crossing in the last five years. 

In December 2010, ice cream parlour owner Jan Graham, 54, was killed on the crossing.

Friends of Sacha took to social media to the teenager, while others left floral tributes next to the rail crossing

Three weeks later, in January 2011, artist Anne Nacci, also 54, was found dead at the same spot.

And in February 2011, tea room owner Anthony Sait, 40, died after being hit by a train on the crossing.

All of the deaths were unconnected and the cause of each was found to be suicide. 

Network Rail today said the crossing is one which it would like to shut down, following the number of fatalities.

A spokesman said: 'This was a tragic incident and our thoughts are with her family and friends.

'We want to close level crossings where we can and this is one that we would like to close. Closing a crossing isn't always a simple or easy.

'To do so, we need to work very closely with people who use the crossing and our lineside neighbours.'
