David Cameron vowed to tear up 60 years of planning law to build new towns and give Britain another airport in the South East.

The Prime Minister unveiled plans for a wave of new ‘garden cities’ – quickly dubbed ‘Cam Towns’ – and gave his strongest support yet for a new ‘Boris Island’ airport in the Thames estuary, heavily promoted by London Mayor Boris Johnson.

Accepting there would be ‘costs and protests’, Mr Cameron shrugged off opposition to the planning overhaul, saying he wants a Victorian-style blitz on new infrastructure building to boost growth.

He warned that failure to act would condemn Britain to being a second-rate nation.

But his plans were quickly condemned by rural groups and green campaigners as a blueprint for ‘disfiguring’ the countryside that would damage the fabric of Britain.

In a speech at the Institute of Civil Engineering in London, the Prime Minister vowed to overcome what he called a ‘failure of nerve’ on planning.

Mr Cameron rejected calls by groups such as the National Trust to tear up its new National Planning Policy Framework, due shortly, saying it would provide ‘the biggest simplification of our bureaucratic, top-down planning laws in 60 years’.

He said the Government would protect green belts and national parks, but added: ‘We also urgently need to find places where we are prepared to allow significant new growth to happen.’

Vowing to recreate a ‘visionary plan’ from 1944 to build new towns across the South East, Mr Cameron said: ‘The growth of our towns and cities has been held back by a planning system which has encouraged development of the wrong sort in the wrong places.’

He said places such as Hampstead Garden Suburb, Letchworth and Welwyn Garden City were ‘not perfect but popular’ and the coalition would seek to build more towns that were ‘green, planned, secure, with gardens, places to play and characterful houses, not just car-dominated concrete grids’.

Mr Cameron said the Government would begin consulting later this year ‘on how to apply the principles of garden cities to areas with high potential growth, in places people want to live’.

He added: ‘We must get our planning system fit for purpose. It needs to be quick. It needs to be easier to use. And it needs to better support growth, jobs and homes.’

The Prime Minister said the Government needed to be similarly ‘bold’ about air transport too.

Risking a fresh row with the Liberal Democrats, who oppose all airport expansion in the South East, he said: ‘I’m not blind to the need to increase airport capacity, particularly in the South East.

‘We need to retain our status as a key global hub for air travel, not just a feeder route to bigger airports elsewhere, in Frankfurt, Amsterdam or Dubai.’

The Tories have ruled out a third runway at Heathrow but Mr Cameron made warm noises about building a new international hub airport East of London.

‘Yes, this will be controversial. We 
will be bringing forward options in our aviation strategy which will 
include an examination of the pros and cons of a new airport in the 
Thames estuary.’

He praised Boris Johnson, saying he had ‘done very well in driving forward this agenda’.

Mr Cameron also unveiled £150million of new investment in ‘shovel ready’ building projects that already have planning permission but are stalled by lack of investment.

Chancellor George Osborne will also be announcing ten ‘super-connected’ cities that are to have universal access to super-fast broadband as part of the drive to improve telecommunications.

Neil Sinden, Director of Policy for the Campaign to Protect Rural England, attacked the plans for building in the countryside.

He said: ‘If the Government’s planning reforms remain unchanged from the draft published last year, pressure for sprawling development is precisely what we can expect.

‘Unless the final planning framework recognises the intrinsic value of our countryside as a whole, we fear a rash of sporadic and inappropriate development across the country, disfiguring the rural landscape which is so valued by local communities.’

But Mr Cameron vowed to stand up to the critics.

‘There will be costs and protests. And I am certainly not doing it in the hope of immediate political advantage,’ he said.

‘I can see the furious objections – the banner headlines – already.’

But he added: ‘We will take difficult decisions, we will risk short-term unpopularity.

‘We will hold fast to our vision in the face of vested interests, because our motivation and our duty is to protect and champion the national interest.’
