Roger Federer brought Flushing Meadows to its feet  by surviving a full frontal assault from mercurial Frenchman Gael Monfils to reach the semi-finals of the US Open.

Federer fought off two match points in the fourth set before going on to win 4-6, 3-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 in three hours and a half hours against the No 20 seed, who could not quite find adequate composure when he had the Swiss master at his mercy.

Sometimes swilling Coke at the changeovers, as is his habit, the coach-less Monfils could not convert two match points when he led 6-5 and had his opponent serving at 15-40 in the fourth set. He was reminded of the time-honoured lesson that you do not let Federer wriggle free without paying for it.

It would have been such a romantic victory for the charismatic Parisian, whose mantra is that tennis is a sport, not a job. The hard-headed professionalism of Federer and enduring combative instincts won through in the end, and now he meets the Croatian Marin Cilic for a place in the final.

The first two sets had been a wretched display from the Swiss, now past his 33rd birthday, but he fought back by charging into the net repeatedly in a manner that will have had his coach Stefan Edberg purring with delight.

After missing the two match points Monfils served a couple of double faults in the next game to be broken, and he clearly could not get the disappointment off his mind. 

The fifth set became predictable procession as the Frenchman collapsed, just as he did in the deciding set of his quarter final against Andy Murray at the same stage of the French Open, with Federer taking just 27 minutes to wrap it up.

Federer said: 'It's just unbelievable to win matches like this at slams. I have won other big ones in other places. But over best of five, saving match points against Gael in an atmosphere that it was out here, it's definitely very special.' 

It was the ninth time in 33-year-old Federer's career that he has come back from two sets down to win.

Federer said: 'It would have been an unbelievable letdown for me to get broken at 5-4 [in the fourth set] and lose a match like that. It would have been not very cool.

'I knew I could play better after the first couple of sets. I believed I could turn it around from the get-go when the third set started and I'm so happy the crowd got into it.

'The rallies were incredible at times and my game really picked up. I served great in the fifth when it mattered.'
