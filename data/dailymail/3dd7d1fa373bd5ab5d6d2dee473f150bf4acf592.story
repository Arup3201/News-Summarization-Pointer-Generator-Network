Nathan Harrison, aged four (pictured) died after accidentally starting a fire with a utility lighter he mistook for a toy while hiding under a bed

A four-year-old boy died after accidentally setting fire to his makeshift den during a game of hide and seek with his brother, an inquest has heard.

Nathan Harrison, from Keighley in West Yorkshire, died after he found the lighter which he 'mistook for a toy'  and accidentally started the fire.

The incident took place on August 11 last year while he was hiding under the bed.

The polyester duvet quickly caught fire and filled the room with toxic black smoke.

His horrified mother Jodie Collins, who had been using an exercise machine in the garage while her sons played, discovered the fire and pulled the little boy out of the bedroom.

A heartbreaking statement read to Bradford Coroner's Court heard how she wrapped Nathan up in a towel as she carried him out of the house.

The statement said: 'I sat on the driveway cuddling him in my arms. It was at this point I believed he had died.'

Nathan was rushed to nearby Airedale Hospital, but despite the best efforts of medics he died from the effects of inhalation.

The court heard his brother Matthew, aged 10, had taken the utility lighter from the top shelf of the pantry at the family's home and placed it under his bed to look at later because he thought it 'looked like a gun' and he 'wanted to shoot it out of the window'.

After finishing her exercise Ms Collins had gone upstairs to shower when she noticed Matthew's bedroom door had blackened around the top.

Believing her sons to be playing outside and not having her mobile phone on her, she ran out of the house to raise the alarm with her next door neighbour.

She returned to the house to find the boys, but her shouts couldn't be heard over the sound of the smoke alarm.

After disabling the alarm she saw Matthew at the bottom of the stairs and asked him where Nathan was, and Matthew replied he had gone to the toilet.

After finding the bathroom empty Ms Collins went into Matthew's room to find it engulfed in smoke.

She twice tried to enter the room but was unable to breathe properly due to the toxic fumes.

She then grabbed a towel to cover her mouth and ran into the room, where she found Nathan collapsed at the foot of the bed.

In a statement read out to the court, Ms Collins said: 'I grabbed one of Nathan's limbs and dragged him out of the room, banging his body on the floor.

'I was too dizzy from all the smoke to carry him. After I got him out I wrapped him in a towel and carried him outside.

'I sat on the driveway cuddling him in my arms. It was at this point I believed he had died.'

When investigators examined the lighter used by Nathan they found that the safety 'off' position that prevents it igniting had been switched to the 'on' position.

Ms Collins' statement described the strong bond between Matthew and Nathan.

'Matthew adored Nathan. In fact he mothered him and we often had to set boundaries to curb this mothering,' her statement said.

The fire spread to bedding which turned into toxic smoke and prevented Nathan from getting out of the room

Recording a narrative verdict about the incident, senior coroner for West Yorkshire Martin Fleming said: 'Nathan was a very much loved son, grandson and brother.

'Tragically Nathan came into contact with the lighter and plainly the four-year-old mistook that for a toy.

'The naked flame spread to the bedding which turned into toxic smoke and prevented the little boy from getting out of the room.'

Mr Fleming added he would look into making recommendations aimed at making utility lighters harder to use for young children.
