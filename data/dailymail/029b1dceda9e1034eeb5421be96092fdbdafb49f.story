Pupils have staged a protest at a secondary school amid claims a teenager who shaved her head to raise money for charity after her best friend died of cancer has been banned from lessons.

Mia Flood, 14, was devastated when friend Georgina Anderson, 15, died after a battle with cancer.

She promised her friend before she died that she would shave her head and donate the hair to the Little Princesses Trust  - a charity which makes wigs for other young cancer patients.

Pupils have staged a protest at Redcar secondary school amid claims a teenager who shaved her head to raise money for charity after her best friend died of cancer has been banned from lessons

Mia Flood, 14, vowed to shave her head when friend Georgina Anderson, 15, died after a battle with cancer. But Redcar Academy classes the shave as an 'extreme hairstyle', and she is now being schooled at home

She also planned to donate money raised from the charity head shave - carried out on Saturday - to the Teenage Cancer Trust, as a thank you for helping Georgina’s family throughout her ordeal.

It is understood that Mia's mother has ordered a wig but until it arrives her daughter is having to be schooled at home.

A Facebook group called 'Let Mia Flood Back into Redcar Academy’ claims that the school class the head shave as an ‘extreme hairstyle’ and she has been forbidden from attending lessons unless she wears a wig.

A post on the Facebook page reads: 'Redcar Academy, the school that Mia Flood goes to had said that if Mia was to get her head shaved, she would not be allowed to attend school, because her shaved head is classed as an “extreme hairstyle”.”

The post appears to have promoted scores of pupils to stage a protest outside the academy this morning.

Cleveland Police have confirmed they arrested a 'young person' at the Academy, on suspicion of a public order offence and he has now been charged.

A statement released by the academy and Mia's family said that it had been agreed that arrangements for Mia's education would be made if she went ahead with the shave.

It reads: 'It is with great regret that the fund raising event held in memory of Georgina Anderson, raising money for Teenage Cancer Trust has been overshadowed by a distortion of the facts.

'Mia’s parents and Redcar Academy agreed prior to the event held on Saturday 18 January on arrangements for her education, should she choose to have her head shaved.

'At no point did Redcar Academy intend to suspend or exclude Mia from education.

'The Academy has supported fund raising for the Teenage Cancer Trust by hosting events in school, promoting the download of the Georgina Anderson single before Christmas and widely promoting Saturday’s event.

'Mrs Flood confirmed "this was never about my daughter or Redcar Academy, it was always about raising funds in Georgina’s memory.

'"I am saddened that due to exaggeration and inaccuracies in the press that my family and Redcar Academy have received unnecessary attention from the local media”.

'Redcar Academy and the Flood Family would like to thank everyone who has supported them and their fundraising efforts for the Teenage Cancer Trust, in memory of Georgina Anderson.'

Georgina, of Marske-on-Sea, died after a four-month battle with a rare and aggressive form of liver cancer.

The police were on standby for the strike by pupils at the academy

The talented musician had a lifelong dream of having her music heard around the world but died before her ambition could be realised.

However, following her death one of her songs, entitled Two Thirds of a Piece, was released, drawing praise from Simon Cowell.

At first medics thought Georgina might have been suffering from gall stones but found she had an extremely rare and aggressive form of cancer.

She underwent chemotherapy but the disease spread to her lungs and doctors later gave her and her family the news that there was nothing more they could do.

Georgina passed away in November last year, leaving her parents Paul and Helen, devastated.

Facebook users have written on Facebook of the school’s decision to ban the teenager from lessons.

One posted: 'Takes a lot of courage to do that and for a secondary school not to support her is shocking.

'She’s done it for a good cause not because she fancied a different hairstyle.'

Another added: 'Get a petition up for all the pupils and parents to sign to let Mia back in school, Redcar academy should be ashamed x'

Another added: 'Well done very courageous. The whole school should shave their heads...'
