A mystery donor responsible for thousands of rubber ducks found with cash strapped to them across the world has been revealed - as a charity started by a British mum.

More than 2,300 of the yellow bath toys have popped across the globe in 56 countries including Nigeria, Australia, Peru, Japan and India.

Bewildered people have been picking up the ducks and finding up to £50 attached to them along with a message asking them to spread on the goodwill when they can.

Ann Rowcliffe began the project after she lost her daughter Clare (pictured), who loved the little yellow ducks, to Cystic Fibrosis in April last year

Hundreds of people who have found the ducks have then left them elsewhere with the same message attached - and the craze spread globally.

Now Ann Rowcliffe, founder of Little Yellow Duck Project, has now stepped forward to unravel the mystery. 

The mother began the project after she lost her daughter Clare to Cystic Fibrosis in April last year.

She, along with the rest of Clare's family and friends, started handing out ducks to strangers around her hometown in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.

Each one had a message asking the finders to visit thelittleyellowduckproject.org where they can find out information about organ donation and register their duck as found.

But the craze has since spiralled out of control and people have been carrying on the act of kindness by leaving the ducks in public places with gifts or money attached to them as well as inspirational messages.

Incredibly, more than 2,300 ducks have been registered on the website's interactive map but thousands more are expected to be unregistered after they were passed on without the website address.

Ann said: 'My daughter Clare was crazy about little yellow ducks. She had a duck umbrella, duck scarf, duck toys and even duck slippers.

'Clare suffered with cystic fibrosis. She was waiting for a double lung transplant, but sadly we didn't find a donor in time and aged 26, she passed away.

'Her corneas were donated to a young man and woman so that they could see again. It was an incredible gift and it made me think about other ways I could honour Clare's memory.

More than 2,300 of the yellow bath toys have popped across the globe in 56 countries including Nigeria, Australia, Peru, Japan and India which have been registered online with the charity (pictured)

'On the anniversary of her death I handed out rubber ducks to strangers in our town centre. Each one had a label with information about organ donation attached.

'Afterwards one of Clare's friends Emma set up the Little Yellow Duck Project.'

The latest duck to be found was discovered outside a Turkish restaurant in Tonbridge, Kent, last week with a £50 note strapped to it. 

A message attached to it read: 'I'm a duck and I have a present for you. Why not buy a friend a coffee, or treat yourself - you can do whatever you want.

'But keep me in your pocket, and when you can, put something else under me and hide me in town for someone else to find and benefit from your kindness. Let's be nice. Go be nice.'

Office worker Neil Mitchell, 44, said he found one next to a pub with a letter and a £10 note in the same town.

One creative 'duck' was even crafted out of an orange and some cardboard as part of the Little Yellow Duck Project

He said: 'I picked it up and looked at the duck and thought 'oh that's a really nice thing to do. I hope people carry it on and spread the goodwill.'

Neil said he bought five lottery tickets with the surprise windfall and left them with the duck at a secret spot for someone else to find.

The charity is also asking volunteers to knit or craft ducks out of whatever materials they can get their hands on and attach labels supporting the project.

Ann said: 'The idea was for people to hand craft little yellow ducks and leave them in public places. The finder can then register where they found their duck on the project's website and get information on organ donation.

'I wish I could tell Clare that her collection and brave example have gone global. I know she'd be chuffed.' 

Many of the ducks have been found with differing amounts of money and a message attached to it which read: 'I'm a duck and I have a present for you. Why not buy a friend a coffee, or treat yourself - you can do whatever you want. But keep me in your pocket, and when you can, put something else under me and hide me in town for someone else to find and benefit from your kindness. Let's be nice. Go be nice.'

Abi found her duck on a tour of the Warner Studio in Watford. She wrote: 'Thank you to the maker of this lovely little yellow duck. He was found today at Warner Brothers Studio Tour in Watford, England.

'I have called him Ian after my dad who died 4 years ago whilst waiting for a liver transplant.

'Had he received his transplant, I'm certain he'd have been on the Harry Potter Tour with us, but this lovely little yellow duck made me feel that he was with us all day!

'My mom, husband, daughter, son and myself are all registered organ donors - keep up the good work.'

Craig in Colorado, USA, added: 'My pre-schoolers found this on our playground when we went out for recess.

'They were like, what is this, were did it come from? I saw what was on the tag and here I am checking it out.

'I am going to take Sneech back to school and explain who he is. Thanks it made them smile.'

Angela Joss who found her duck in a shopping centre in Aberdeen wrote: 'What a lovely project for a lovely girl. So delighted to have found a duck today.

'We donated my Dad's organs, including his corneas, after his untimely death. I have always meant to donate blood but been too scared but am really going to do it this time.

'Thinking of Clare tonight xxx.'

Lorraine Cairnes in Sydney, Australia, wrote: 'Left behind after a visit from New Zealand artist Val Griffith Jones.

'Chuck the duck is now making friends with the local possums and rainbow lorikeets in Castlecrag, Australia.

'Thank you to all the world's wonderful donors of life! These little ducks carry a HUGE message of hope.'
