An Aussie schoolboy has been astonished to discover a koala 'trying to steal' his car, sitting happily in the front of the vehicle with his four little paws gripping the steering wheel

Victorian man Michael Box was putting out the bins when he first spotted the intruder sitting contentedly in the front seat of his son Sam's car.

'I think he was trying to take the car! My son's lucky he took the keys out of it,' Box joked to 3AW.

'Get in loser, we're going shopping': The koala looked completely at home behind the wheel of the 4WD

It is entirely possible that he assumed he had not been spotted, given the car is painted in camouflage tones

The cuddly koala was caught red-handed but remained shameless in his pursuit.

It is entirely possible that the koala assumed he had not been spotted, given the car's camouflage tones.

Nevertheless he refused to budge, determined to work out how to take the car for a spin.

'He was quite calm, I got within three feet of him and he wasn't concerned, he was just looking around,' Box told 3AW.

Mr Box's 15-year-old son Sam drives the Land Rover down his long driveway every morning.

Sam meets school bus at the front of their 200-acre sheep farm in Maude, 30 kilometres from Geelong and then drives the car back down the driveway at the end of the day.

When Sam hopped off the bus that afternoon, he was surprised to discover the car was already occupied with the koala still hoping to go on a joy ride.

It was at that point that the koala realised the jig was up. 

Sam took a few photographs whilst the marsupial eyed him up and down.

“I opened the door and he just got out and walked away,' Sam told 9news.com.au. 

The cheeky criminal took shelter in the nearest tree, perhaps plotting his next car-jacking attempt. 

'You see koalas around here, but not too often in the car!' joked his father.

Father Michael Box and his 15-year-old son Sam say they see koalas frequently but 'not too often in the car!'
