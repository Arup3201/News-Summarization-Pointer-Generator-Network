This is the moment a gormless burglar realises he has been caught red-handed on CCTV - seconds before he attempts to cover up his crime by stealing the camera.

The open-mouthed thief stares directly into the lens for several seconds, seemingly unable to decide what to do with himself.

He then appears to shout the word ‘camera’, before continuing to stare at the lens - still with his mouth wide open.

Caught: This is the moment a burglar stares gormlessly into the lens of a camera after realising he has been caught on CCTV in Daventry, Northamptonshire

The open-mouthed thief looks directly at the camera for several seconds, seemingly unable to decide what to do with himself

Despite being caught on tape for the past 20 seconds, the burglar then
attempts to hide from the wall-mounted camera by ducking down out of 
its view and shuffling underneath the lens.

The defeated-looking burglar is then seen turning the camera to face the wall, before wrenching it from its stand and stuffing it in his bag.

But unbeknown to the burglar, his efforts were pointless - because the video is still accessible in online storage.

Phi Chong installed the high-tech camera in his parent's home in Daventry, Northamptonshire, in a bid to catch any intruders after they were burgled in November.

The camera, which he had imported from the US, records straight onto the internet and goes into online storage.

He has now shared the footage - including several still image from the video - on social media websites.

The man seems to shout the word 'camera', suggesting there could have been an accomplice with him during the raid at the family home

The 30-year-old, a property developer 
based in London, said: 'The look on the guy’s face is priceless as he 
tries to figure out what to do next.

'Hilariously he then belatedly tries to hide from the camera by ducking underneath it. He obviously thought by stealing it would hide his crime but the footage was already sent to an online server.

'My parents were robbed in November and I suspected they would be back so I installed the camera.

'It’s the first camera of its kind and it’s not available in the UK, I had it imported from the US. There’s no evidence for the burglars to steal. It records straight to the internet and goes into storage.

The defeated-looking burglar, who took cash and sentimental jewellery from the home, then starts to walk towards the lens

Hilariously, the thief then ducks beneath the camera, despite having 
been recorded on film for the past 20 seconds. He then turns the camera 
away from him

'It is basically a web camera but the 
sophisticated stuff is where it gets recorded to. You can hear him 
talking and he is talking to someone else so there’s at least two of 
them.

'He was mentioning a camera and before that he shouts something, it sounds like he is calling out a name.'

The man raided the family home on Saturday afternoon between 1.30pm and 2.30pm.

Mr Chong said nothing expensive was taken during the raid but he has appealed for help in tracing two items of sentimental value which he believes were taken.

Before realising he was caught on CCTV, the brazen thief fiddled with the door in the living room

He said: 'My brother Vay Chong passed away and left a gold necklace and Buddha amulet. This was intended for his unborn son. He is having a child and it was meant to be gift for him.'

His sister, Siu-Lan Chong, 32, added: 'We are upset and angry this has happened, given the recent death of my brother we are all going through an emotional time.

'The thoughtless and irresponsible act of these criminals has had an enormous impact on our family and we urge anyone who knows or has seen anything to come forward.'

The burglary took place in Daventry, Northamptonshire, on Saturday between 1.30pm and 2.30pm

Northamptonshire Police have also released still photos from the footage in a bid to track down the thief, who they believe was carrying a weapon.

Inspector Phil Mills said: 'We are investigating a number of leads, including CCTV footage provided by the home owner.

'We would like to speak to anyone who may recognise the man in the photograph or indeed anyone who may have seen any suspicious activity in the area around the time of the burglary.

'We believe he may have been carrying a weapon at the time of the burglary and would urge people to get in touch straight away if they recognise him..'

A spokesperson for the force added: 'Officers are investigating all leads, including CCTV footage provided by the home owner.'

Anyone with information is asked to call Northamptonshire Police on 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
