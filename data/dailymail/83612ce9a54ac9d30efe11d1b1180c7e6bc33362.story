No, thanks! Russell manages to avoid cakes, despite working in a school canteen

If you've had ever a problem with your weight, a school canteen - where you'll be surrounded by chips, apple crumble and creamy custard - is probably the last place you'd want to work.

But that hasn't stopped Russell Robinson, a former morbidly obese forklift truck driver who once weighed a scale-cracking 35 stone, from getting a job as a school chef.

The 43-year-old father-of-four started his new job after losing a colossal 22 stone - excess weight he 
piled on after losing both his job and his wife.

The once morbidly obese driver from Scarborough, North Yorkshire, used to drink up to 40 pints a week and gorged on takeaways.

He felt so self-conscious of his bulk - which he attempted to shroud in size XXXXXXL T-shirts (made for him at a specialist shop) that he could barely leave the house.

Russell started piling on the pounds in 
1998 after splitting up with his wife and mother of his two daughters, 
Paige, now 20, and Megan, 18. He quickly went from 15 stone to morbidly obese.

He
developed the life-threatening condition sleep apnoea, which meant he 
stopped breathing up to 50 times a night because of his colossal build.

Having
failed miserably on different diets, Russell turned to his doctor as a 
last-ditch attempt to fight the flab. He was told he was eligible for a 
gastric bypass on the NHS and has now slimmed down to a trim 13 stone.

Now,
Russell has a new job as a school chef and has even found love with a 
new partner. He said: 'My life was a mess. I didn't feel like doing 
anything.

'I couldn't afford
to buy fruit and vegetables so I ate c***. I didn't really go to the 
pub but I'd drink can after can of lager at home.

'I
didn't own a pair of scales and had no idea how much I weighed. It was 
terribly embarrassing. I'd go into the canteen at work and hear people's
snide remarks.'

Regular shops didn't stock his size so he had to buy his clothes from specialist stockists.

Russell, who works at Filey Secondary 
School, North Yorkshire, said: 'I just fell into this cycle and couldn't
get out of it. I missed my kids and felt really depressed.

'I
was eating all the wrong things. I ate foods like Chinese take aways, 
burgers, pizzas and chocolate. I just loved my food and it was my only 
comfort really.'

Hard at work: Russel working in the school kitchen at his new job

After another relationship, he went on
to have another two daughters, Imogen, nine, and Nuala, eight, but when
that failed in 2007, his problems with his weight only got worse.

His weight rose to more than 35 stone, and his BMI was critically high at 72.9 - more than three times what it should be.

Russ also developed sleep apnoea, 
which causes sufferers to stop breathing in their sleep, diabetes, leg 
ulcers, high blood pressure - all caused by him being severely 
overweight.

He said: 'I wasn't sleeping properly 
so would nap when I felt like it. I lost interest in everything. I used 
to like going fishing and shooting game but I didn't feel like doing 
anything.

'Exercise was a 
no-no because of my size. My mum was really concerned. She kept 
pestering me to do something about it. I tried lots of fad diets and 
even slimming pills. All they did was give me a bad tummy.'

Out of desperation, Russell turned to his GP for help who agreed he was a suitable candidate for weight loss surgery.

Russell opted to have the operation at Spire Leeds Hospital after reading about the surgeon's high success rate.

The long wait: Russell waiting for his NHS gastric bypass

He was put on a strict diet to help shrink his liver and managed to almost a stone.

In
February 2011, he had a gastric bypass operation, which involved 
re-routing the digestive system past most of his stomach. Russell has 
since lost 90 per cent of his excess weight and now has a more healthier
BMI of 29.

He now works as a chef, making lunch for the school's students and staff but he says being around food is not a problem.

Russell said: 'I know what to eat and am now more careful about the choice of food I eat.

'My
diet is much healthier, more fruit, high fibre and wholegrain foods. I 
have to take food in smaller quantities so it's important to make sure 
every calorie is nutritious.

'I'm smaller now than when I got married. Sometimes it's hard to believe it.'

Me at last: Russell now weighs just 13 stone and says he finally feels himself, and his children say they finally have their father back

We could both get in! Russell and his current partner Sarah hold up a pair of his enormous old trousers

Russell has been dating partner Sarah Cooper, 41, for five months and they are now planning to move in together.

Russell said: 'Before surgery, I'd practically become a recluse. I wasn't comfortable with myself and the way I looked.

'I'd known Sarah for years through her sister. She knew me when I was big before my operation.

'She's not superficial and says she'd love me whatever weight I was but it definitely gave me the confidence to talk to her.

'Life is brilliant now. I've got my motorbike licence. I'd not been able to get on a bike before because I was so big.

'I do so much more with the kids. I love taking them camping or for long walks. They say they've got their Dad back.'Russell is now hoping to get funding for another operation to remove his excess skin.

Sweet denial: Russell, pictured with partner Sarah, is still very careful about what he eats so his weight does not sky-rocket once more
