She been a regular on the London part circuit of late, but it was a more civil affair on Saturday as Princess Beatrice attended the wedding of Prince Amedeo of Belgium and Elisabetta Maria Rosboch Von Wolkenstein.

The ceremony took place at Basilica Santa Maria in Trastevere in Rome, where the 25-year-old royal hit all the right fashion notes in a beautiful dusty pale pink dress.

But it appears to be the exact same Valentino dress - and sparkly Valentino shoes - she wore with a Valentino coat to the wedding of Prince William and Catherine the Duchess of Cambridge in 2011.

Gorgeous: Beatrice of York attends the wedding of Prince Amedeo and Elisabetta Maria Rosboch Von Wolkenstein in Rome, Italy. The princess looked ladylike in her pale pink chiffon dress

We've seen that before! Princess Beatrice's dress is the same one she wore to Prince William's wedding to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, in 2011

Royal wave: Despite recycling her Valentino outfit, worn to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding in 2011, Princess Beatrice still looked stunning on Saturday at the wedding of Prince Amedeo and Elisabetta Maria Rosboch von Wolkenstein

The gorgeous dress had a flattering scoop neck, long sleeves and a touch of lace stripes across the top.

The chiffon skirt was detailed with a pretty sash, perfectly accentuating the Princess’ small waist.

The
 skirt ended just above the knee and Beatrice complimented the look with
 silver court shoes, with just enough height and sparkle to provide a 
touch of glamour to the outfit.

She accessorised with a matching pale pink clutch bag, and wore her long hair down and parted to the side.

And
 this was just the latest in a run of fashion wins for the Beatrice, the
 daughter of Prince Andrew, Duke of York and Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of 
York.

The young royal has attended celebrity-filled bashes almost every night this past week.

On
 Monday she went to the Masterpiece Marie Curie party looking 
effortlessly glamerous and perfectly on trend in a colourful printed 
skirt and white blouse with bejewelled neckline. She topped the look off
 with dark blue satin heels.

On Tuesday, it was a sweeping organza gown and lilac strappy sandals for the A-List-only Serpentine Gallery Summer Party.

So feminine: This pleated skirt is incredibly flattering on Princess Beatrice, who paired teh dress with sparkly heels for the perfect touch of glamour

Joining
 the likes of Bradley Cooper, Suki Waterhouse and Cara Delevingne, 
Beatrice’s strapless white dress featured leather flowers by the 
designer Nicholas Oakwell.

After
 the summertime evening party, which her younger sister Princess Eugenie
 also attended, Beatrice and her long-time boyfriend David Clark headed 
to London hotspot Chiltern Firehouse.

And
 the following day she scored fashion points once again: At Wimbledon 
she looked lovely in white blazer and navy blue dress complete with a 
jazzy studded belt.

28-year-old Prince Amedeo is sixth-in-line to the Belgian throne. The elegant wedding in Italy took place yesterday. His now-wife, Elisabetta, is a journalist the only child of Italian aristocrats.
