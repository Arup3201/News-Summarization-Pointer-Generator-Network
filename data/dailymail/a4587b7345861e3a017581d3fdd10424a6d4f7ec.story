Roberto Martinez has jokingly blamed the photographer for the picture of Aaron Lennon that gave the impression he was unhappy signing for Everton on loan.

The picture, taken by external photographer Peter Byrne but released by the club, became an internet sensation with MP Andy Burnham - an Everton fan - remarking on Twitter that the England winger appeared distinctly unimpressed with his new place of work.

Lennon, having arrived from Tottenham, then had to insist on the same medium that he was happy.

'He is very happy - I would blame the photographer because it is their job to make him produce a nice smile!' joked Martinez.

'But I saw a different face - a focused face, of someone who is ready to train and to perform.

'It has been great to see the way Aaron has adjusted, because when you sign a player in January, it is very difficult to find someone who is up to speed with the league and their match fitness.

'He is fully fit and ready to make an impact as part of the squad for the weekend.

'We are delighted, and I know there has been a lot said about the pictures - I will chase the photographer because I wasn't happy with that at all!'

Meanwhile, Martinez has dismissed talk of James McCarthy suffering another injury setback and stressed he expects the midfielder to be available for Saturday's Merseyside derby against rivals Liverpool.

It was believed McCarthy, who has only played twice since November due to his hamstring issue and last featured in late December, had aggravated the problem in training, ruling him out of this weekend's game.

But asked about that at his press conference on Thursday to preview the clash at Goodison Park, Martinez said: 'No, he hasn't suffered a setback.

'He was in hospital yesterday having a scan to make sure he is fully recovered and the scan showed he is perfectly healed.

'Now it is just a matter of adapting him into the match intensity, and I expect James to be available for the squad at the weekend, so it is terrific news in that respect.'

There was more good news on goalkeeper Tim Howard, who is back in training after a calf problem but will not be fit to face Liverpool. Leon Osman, Steven Pienaar and Tony Hibbert are still ruled out through injury.

Martinez added: 'Tim Howard is training now and it will be important to make the right decision. He feels strong and ready but medical advice says probably another week to make sure he's fully healed and we don't take any risks.Â 

'Any soft tissue injury you have to be wary but it's incredible how quick he's back in training. We will assess him and see but it looks like another week.'

Joel Robles has stepped up to replace Howard and has improved in recent weeks after a difficult start in defeats by Newcastle and Hull.Â 

'It's been great to see the support Joel Robles has received from everyone and I think we have seen him becoming someone who can enjoy that role,' said Martinez.

'As a keeper that's important, such a specific, black and white position. It was great to see him perform like he did against Palace, keeping a clean sheet.'
