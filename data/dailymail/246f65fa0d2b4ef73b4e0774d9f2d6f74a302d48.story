The detention of an anti-corruption activist as he began a hunger strike has sparked protests across India, with police rounding up at least 1,200 supporters in New Delhi alone.

Anna Hazare began fasting in custody after police arrested him at home to stop the planned public hunger strike in a New Delhi park, which was certain to embarrass India's scandal-plagued government.

Hazare's demand for tougher anti-corruption laws has galvanised Indians fed up with the bribery and favouritism that has infested government at all levels and become a political distraction, preventing progress in addressing the widening gap between rich and poor.

Across the nation, thousands of people rallied with placards calling for a 'revolution against corruption' and taunting authorities to 'please arrest me'. Some donned white caps resembling Hazare's with the words 'I am Anna Hazare' scrawled in Hindi and English on them.

The 73-year-old social activist, clad in simple white clothes, has become an anti-corruption icon by channelling the tactics of freedom fighter Mahatma Gandhi. He had planned the fast weeks ago to press for stronger legislation to create an anti-corruption watchdog, after successfully holding a four-day fast in April to demand a draft law.

Police rejected his protest plans after organisers refused to limit the number of fasting days and participants, Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram said.

'Protests are perfectly permissible and welcome, but it must be under reasonable conditions,' he said.

Hazare waved at a throng of TV cameras outside his home as he was driven away to a police mess hall. His supporters then released a video appeal that he had recorded before his arrest.

'My dear countrymen, the second freedom struggle has begun, and now I have also been arrested. But will this movement be stopped by my arrest? No, not at all. Don't let it happen,' he said.

The hunger strikes have catapulted the issue of India's culture of corruption to the top of the TV news and inspired others across the nation to fast in solidarity.

A series of scandals unveiled in the last year has embarrassed the government and paralysed Parliament, with lawmakers trading insults and accusations instead of addressing widespread malnutrition and the need for land reform.

Today, supporters are protesting in cities including Mumbai, Hyderabad and Kolkata. Many said Hazare's arrest was antidemocratic and a violation of civil rights.

Chidambaram said the government was only seeking to maintain order.

'We are not prohibiting a peaceful democratic protest. Nowhere in the world is a protest allowed without any conditions,' he said, adding that Hazare's camp had rejected police conditions for holding a safe rally.

The governing Congress party accused Hazare of meddling in politics and hijacking public policy with his fast when he should express his views to elected officials.

'He is not fighting against corruption but doing politics,' party secretary-general Digvijay Singh said, adding that the government has a right to take steps to avoid a situation that threatens law and order.

The opposition slammed the arrest as evidence that the government is 'imbalanced' on the issue of corruption and demanded Prime Minister Manmohan Singh himself address the controversy.

'The government is hell-bent on crushing civil rights of the citizens,' said Sushma Swaraj, leader of the nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party.
