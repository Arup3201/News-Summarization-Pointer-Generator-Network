Questioning: Police have detained a man who planned to meet missing mother Sarai Sierra the day she disappeared in Istanbul

Police in Istanbul have detained a man who was one of the last in contact with missing New York mother Sarai Sierra who vanished the same day she planned to meet up with him.

The man only identified as 'Taylan' on social media sites was taken into police custody today after questioning on the disappearance of the 33-year-old mother of two who went missing while vacationing alone in Istanbul.

Sierra was last heard from on Jan. 21, the day she was to start her journey back home to Staten Island as well as the day she planned to meet up with 'Taylan,' according to their online communications.

A police official refused to identify him or provide further details on the arrest. He spoke on condition of anonymity in line with government rules that bar civil servants from speaking to reporters without authorization.

Police also now say her cell phone has been 
activated twice since reported missing leading them to believe there's a
good chance she is still alive.

Sierra is said to have made a call on her phone using Skype on January 30, and have activated it once more again on Thursday.

Police say four more Turkish citizens are sought 
for questioning by police after also communicating with her through 
various social media sites.

Turkish news reports said Sierra had arranged to meet her contact, 'Taylan,' on Galata Bridge she wanted to photograph the day she went missing. Previous reports claimed the planned to meet on the 20th.

No trace: Sarai Sierra, a 33-year-old mother of two young sons, set off for Istanbul January 7 and has since vanished. Her family last heard from her January 21 and she failed to catch her flight home

It was about a mile from Sierra's hostel, Dogan news agency reported but it's not known if the meeting had actually taken place.

'We
did not meet that day, but we had met before,' Taylan told police while
adding that it was four months ago that they met for the first time 
online, Turkish paper the daily Hürriyet reports.

Authorities are now scouring security 
camera images near to the bridge to see if the meeting did in fact take 
place, the news agency said.

Sierra left for Istanbul on Jan. 7 to explore her photography hobby and made a side trip to Amsterdam, Netherlands, and Munich, Germany. Sierra had planned to go on the trip with a friend, but went alone when the friend couldn't make it.

Her family last heard from her on Jan. 21, when she was supposed to start her journey home, but she never checked into her flight.

Sierra's husband, Steven, and brother, David Jimenez, traveled to Istanbul to help in the search. Sierra's children are 9 and 11.

Staten Island Rep. Michael Grimm confirmed to Staten Island Live that police in Turkey were searching for her online contact but he did not know their relationship or if they had met.

'There's nothing remarkable about their conversation, but the fact that 
he's the last person she had any contact with makes him a person of 
interest,' Grimm said. 'That's a solid lead that needs to be followed up
on.'

He added that he 
spoke with Sierra's husband Steven on Tuesday, and that the man was 
meeting with local authorities and had provided them with passwords to 
her social media sites.

Her husband said 
Sierra was in constant contact with him throughout the trip and knew she
had travelled outside Turkey.

Search: Members of the Istanbul-based Association For Families With Lost Relatives hand out flyers with photos of Sierra, and other missing family members, in Istanbul on Thursday

'These are things she made me well aware
of,' he told Staten Island Live before leaving for Istanbul. 'She kept me 100 percent updated.'

Turkey's Dogan news agency said police had learned that Sierra had travelled
to Amsterdam on January 15 and then on to Munich on January 16, before returning to 
Istanbul on January 19.

Her husband continued: 'Every day while she was there she pretty much kept in
contact with us, letting us know what she was up to, where she was 
going, whether it be through texting or whether it be through video 
chat, she was touching base with us.'

On
Tuesday, Turkish police released security camera footage showing the 
missing mother at a mall near her hostel hours before she disappeared.

Sierra can be seen eating lunch and walking through the mall on January 20 - a day before she was supposed to catch a flight back home - according to local reports.

Sarai was supposed to land in the 
U.S. on January 22, but she never arrived. Airline staff at Newark 
Airport told her husband she had never 
boarded her flight.

Her two sons have not been told their mother is missing.

A
police official said authorities have been reviewing footage from 
around Istanbul's Taksim neighborhood - the city's main hub where she 
was staying at a hostel.

Several police teams have also been 
dispatched to surrounding neighborhoods to find possible clues and 
witnesses, the official said.

He spoke on condition of anonymity, 
in line with government rules that bar civil servants from speaking to 
reporters without prior authorization.

Before she went missing, the 
mother-of-two told family members that she planned to take some 
photographs at Galata Bridge, a well-known tourist destination about a 
mile away from Taksim that spans the Golden Horn waterway.

Her husband, Steven Sierra, waited for
hours at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on the 22nd
to pick her up. Airline attendants in Turkey said that his wife did not
show up for the flight.

Her belongings, including her 
passport, phone, phone chargers, and medical cards, were found in her room at a hostel in Beyoglu, Turkey. An official said authorities were therefore not able to track her by her cell phone.

Mother: Sarai is pictured with her two sons, who are now 9 and 11. They do not know their mother is missing

The hostel’s 
owner told Turkish authorities that he had last seen her last on Sunday 
night.

Mr Sierra told ABC News that
her behavior is highly unusual, that she seemed perfectly content with her life, and that going off the radar is 
extremely out-of-character for her.

The heartbroken 
husband said that he's been married to her for more than 14 years after meeting her at a church youth group, 
adding that his love for her is ‘deeper than it is for any individual'.

He told WABC: ‘You
have so many thoughts going through your mind, you don’t know what to 
think, you don’t know what to believe, you don’t know what to expect, 
you don’t know what will come out of this.'

Mystery: A view of the street with the hostel, in yellow, where Sarai Sierra, a New York City woman, left all her possessions before she disappeared

Skyline: Mrs Sierra posted a series of pictures from Turkey on her Instagram account, including this one of Isanbul

Mrs Sierra's friend, Magalena Rodriguez, told the
New York Daily News that the petite woman, who stands at 5ft2in and 
weighs only 110 pounds, has previously fainted without warning.

Ms Rodriguez fears her friend has fainted and could be hurt somewhere in the unfamiliar country.

Crime in Turkey is generally low and 
Istanbul is a relatively safe city for travelers, though there are areas
where women would be advised to avoid going alone at night.

The Galata and the nearby Galata Bridge areas have been gentrified and are home to fish restaurants, cafes and boutiques.
