England are aiming to run away with the game against South Africa and out-pace the Springboks this weekend - with the help of sprint legend Michael Johnson.

Johnson, who won four Olympic and eight world championship golds, was snapped alongside England full back Mike Brown and Red Rose centre Kyle Eastmond on Tuesday.

In fact 400-metre world record-holder Johnson met the whole England squad at Pennyhill Park and hooker Dylan Hartley revealed his delight at receiving tips from one of athletics' all-time greats.

England succumbed to a 24-21 loss to New Zealand last weekend but host South Africa on Saturday

The Northampton forward posted on Twitter in jest: 'Exchanged some scrum and sprint tips with the man Michael Johnson today. Pleasure to meet one of the greatest @MJGold.'

Known as 'The Man with the Golden Shoes' after the bold and brash footwear Johnson sported during his home Olympics at Atlanta 1996 - when he won the 200m and 400m titles - the American track and field sensation has studied sprinting technique since retiring from the sport.

He has also provided sprinting advice to the likes of the England football team, as well as Arsenal and other Premier League sides.

Meanwhile Brown, who has arguably been England's standout player of the last 12 months and is among the leading full backs in world rugby, accompanied the photo with the caption: 'Great to meet this legend of sport today! One of the greats #MichaelJohnson.'

Johnson won four Olympic and eight world championship golds and broke the 400m world record in 1999

South Africa were beaten 29-15 by Ireland in Dublin last weekend and will to bounce back against England 

England host South Africa at Twickenham on Saturday looking for their first win of the QBE autumn internationals after succumbing to a 24-21 defeat to New Zealand last weekend, their fifth in a row against the Silver Fern.

But the Springboks are also looking to bounce back from a defeat themselves having lost 29-15 to Ireland in Dublin - meaning the HQ faithful should be in for a mouthwatering and tense clash. 

Centre Billy Twelvetrees took the opportunity to have a little fun with his Gloucester and England team-mate Jonny May, who scored his first international try with a majestic effort against the All Blacks last weekend.

Twelvetrees, posting on Twitter, joked: 'Meeting Michael Johnson was pretty awesome today, shame Jonny bottled racing him... #nochance.'
