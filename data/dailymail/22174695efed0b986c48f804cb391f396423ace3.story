Sex could keep the Ebola epidemic
alive even after the World Health Organization (WHO) declares an
area free of the disease, one of the discoverers of the deadly
virus said on Tuesday.

The WHO is hoping to announce later this week that Nigeria
and Senegal are free of Ebola after 42 days with no infections.

The 42 days is the standard period for declaring an outbreak over, twice the
maximum 21-day incubation period of the virus.

The World Health Organization is warning people in West Africa, including Liberia (pictured), to avoid unprotected sex, as the Ebola virus can live in semen for months after infection

Rescue workers like this one in Liberia continue to fight against the spread of the disease. But WHO has some positive news: they are getting closer to declaring Nigeria and Senegal free of Ebola, after 42 days without any new infections

However, it appears the disease can last much longer in
semen.

'In a convalescent male, the virus can persist in semen for
at least 70 days; one study suggests persistence for more than
90 days,' the WHO said in an information note on Monday.

'Certainly, the advice has to be for survivors to use a
condom, to not have unprotected sex, for 90 days,' said Peter
Piot, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical
Medicine and a discoverer of Ebola in 1976.

'If we would apply the rule for double the time, that would
be 180 days — six months,' he told reporters in Geneva. 'I think it (90 days) is probably a
compromise, for practicality.'

Ebola spreads via bodily fluids such as blood and saliva,
but it has also been detected in breast milk and urine, as well
as semen, the WHO says.

The whole live virus has never been
isolated from sweat, however.

More than 3,400 people are already known to have died in the
world's worst Ebola outbreak on record, the vast majority of
them in three West African countries: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra
Leone.

Meanwhile, WHO says Europe will almost inevitably see more cases of the deadly Ebola virus within its borders — but the continent is well prepared to control the disease.

Speaking just hours after Europe's first local case of Ebola infection was confirmed in a nurse in Spain, the WHO's European director, Zsuzsanna Jakab, said further such events were 'unavoidable.'

Spanish health officials said four people had been hospitalised to try and stem any further spread of Ebola there after the nurse became the first person in the world known to have contracted the virus outside of Africa.

'Such imported cases and similar events as have happened in Spain will happen also in the future, most likely,' Jakabsaid.

'It is quite unavoidable ... that such incidents will happen in the future because of the extensive travel both from Europe to the affected countries and the other way around.'

Several countries in the WHO's European region, including France, Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Norway and Spain, have treated patients repatriated after contracting the disease in West Africa, where Ebola has been raging through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia since March.

Ebola has infected some 7,200 people in West Africa, killing more than 3,400 of them in the largest outbreak of the disease in history. Cases have also been imported into Nigeria, Senegal and the United States.

Jakab said that within Europe, health workers caring for repatriated Ebola patients, as well as their families and close contacts, were most at risk of becoming infected.

'But the most important thing...is that Europe is still at low risk and that the western part of the European region particularly is the best prepared in the world to respond to viral haemorrhagic fevers including Ebola.' 

Health experts also warn that Europe will almost inevitably see more cases of Ebola, such as the one of Manuel Garcia Viejo (pictured), a Spanish priest who was diagnosed with the Ebola virus while working in Sierra Leone
