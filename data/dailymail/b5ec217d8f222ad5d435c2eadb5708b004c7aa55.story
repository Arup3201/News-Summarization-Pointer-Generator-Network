Victim: A 28-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after the body of David Lewis (pictured) was found in a river in Cardiff

A 28- year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a man's body was found in a river near the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

David Lewis, 45, had suffered severe head injuries when his body was discovered submerged in the River Taff in the Welsh capital.

The musician's body was spotted under a bridge in the centre of Cardiff on Thursday.

South Wales Police received an anonymous 
call just before midnight on Thursday from a phone kiosk, calling them 
to the river embankment opposite the stadium.

His parents Hetty and Glyndwr Lewis said: 'This is so sad.

'We love David so much and our lives will never be the same again.

'We can't believe such a thing has happened to our son.'

Mr Lewis, of Ystrad Mynach, near Caerphilly, was identified after his body was found more than 20 miles from his home.

Detective Superintendent Paul Hurley said: 'David Alun Lewis lived with his parents in Ystrad Mynach but would occasionally visit Cardiff.

'His parents are understandably very distressed about what has happened to their son, who they have described as a good decent man, highly intelligent and a talented musician.

'While an individual has been arrested and remains in custody, we are still very much appealing for witnesses.'

Scene: The 45-year-old's body was found in the River Taff. He had suffered severe head injuriues

Officers stated they are still looking to hear from anyone who may have seen Mr Lewis in the hours leading up to his death.

The last known sighting of Mr Lewis was at approximately 7.45pm on Wednesday walking towards the River Taff.

He was wearing light blue jeans, a navy anorak style jacket, and a light coloured baseball cap with the wording 'cross hatch'.

Cordon: Police were tipped off by an anonymous call from a phone kiosk in the Grangetown area of the Welsh capital

The body was found submerged in the water next to a path, below Penarth Road

Probe: Forensic officers searched the area on Thursday after the body was spotted
