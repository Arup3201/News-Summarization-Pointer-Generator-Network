Five people have been killed in a shooting at an apartment complex south of Seattle, including a suspect who was shot by police officers responding to the chaotic scene.

Cathy Schrock, a police spokesperson for the city of Federal Way, located 20 miles south of Seattle, said officers responded to a 9.30pm emergency call after shots were fired at the Pinewood Apartments.

It has been reported that there were somewhere between six and 15 shots. Schrock said: 'When we arrived, there was a lot of gunfire already being fired and multiple calls, 911 calls of gunfire.'

Mystery: Police say they do not yet know what caused the fatal shootings

As police officers arrived at the scene they spotted two injured men on the ground in a car park and one of them reached for a gun as the officers moved in to assist them.

Schrock says officers then opened fire. The man was killed but it wasn't immediately clear if it was from police gunfire. No officers were injured.

The other man on the ground and another man in the car park were found dead.

In a search of the complex, police found yet another man dead in one apartment and a slain woman in another.

Schrock said police were trying to determine if the woman was accidentally hit by gunfire.

It was not immediately apparent what triggered the shooting. No further suspects were being sought, and no one was arrested or in custody. The names of the five dead have not yet been released.

A total of eight officers fired their weapons, Schrock said. All have been placed on administrative leave, per standard policy, as the investigation continues.

One man was shot when he pulled a gun on officers who responded to the shooting, according to a police spokeswoman

A law enforcement source toldÂ Fox News a fight may have broken out in the parking lot of the apartment complex, leading to the shooting.

After police flooded the scene and carried out searches of the area, authorities said they did not think another shooter was on the loose or that there was an immediate threat to the public.

'We're going continue to go door to door in hopes that we can find some additional witnesses, and hopefully we won't be finding any more victims,' Schrock said.
