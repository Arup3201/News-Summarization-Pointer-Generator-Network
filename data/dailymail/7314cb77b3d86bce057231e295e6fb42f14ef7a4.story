Passengers on a TUIfly flight were given an almighty shake when their plane was almost blown off course seconds before landing at Madeira Airport.

The flight, on October 20, was coming in for a routine landing when strong winds left the pilot fighting to reach the ground safely. 

The German-based carrier's aircraft wobbled slightly before banking right and then left in what looked like an inadvertent wing wave, before managing to straighten up and hit the runway.

The pilot battles strong winds believed to be a hangover from Hurricane Gonzalo as the plane dips right

Those flying into the Portuguese archipelago would be expecting to escape the autumnal weather further north in Europe but on this flight the sensation was far from that.

It is believed the winds were a hangover from Hurricane Gonzalo, which hammered Bermuda and forced about 80 flights to be cancelled at Healthrow on Tuesday. 

Flavio Silva, who filmed the footage, said the landing was daunting viewing before it came to ground and taxied in as if nothing had happened.

The pilot was praised for a professional landing by viewers on YouTube.

A user calling themselves Icarus3 commented: 'like a boss...well done'

And Tylerama added: 'Just what I said to myself as I watched it. Such a smooth touchdown after the drama a few seconds earlier.'
