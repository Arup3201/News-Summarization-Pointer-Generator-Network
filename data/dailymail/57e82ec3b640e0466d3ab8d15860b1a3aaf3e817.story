The parents of Olympic speedskater Tucker Fredricks will be cheering their son on from the comfort of their living room instead of track side in Russia next month.

Fredericks has asked his family to stay home in Wisconsin because of security concerns.

The athlete from Janesville will be competing in his third and last Olympics after finishing 12th in the 2010 Vancouver Games.

His parents, Dan and Shawn Fredricks, attended the 2010 Games and the 2006 competition in Torino, Italy but won't be making the trip to Russia.

Plea: Tucker Fredricks asked his family to stay away so he can better prepare for the games

In their best interests: Tucker's parents, Dan and Shawn Fredericks have all agreed they don't want to take Tucker off his game

'Tucker said he doesn't want to worry about us or about security,' Dan said.

'We don't want to be a distraction,' Dan said. 'The Olympics are all about him, not about us. He needs to concentrate, and if us being there is going to affect him, then we won't go.'

Dan Fredricks tells The Janesville Gazette his son is worried about the familyâ€™s security, so they will stay home so he can concentrate on skating. Fredricks will be competing in the 500-meter speed skating event Feb. 10. He finished second at the U.S. Olympic Trials.

'It's kind of bittersweet,' his father said. 'We want to go there to support him, but we understand that he has to concentrate on the race. So we said, 'OK, we'll stay home and watch it on TV.''

'Hopefully our worries are nobody else's and our athletes will be safe and we'll come home with some champions,' mom Shawn Fredricks said.

Ready: Vladimir Putin has said that Russia will do 'whatever it takes' to make the Sochi Games secure. An expected 80,000 troops are to be on guard

Wanted: Ruzan Ibragimov, whose husband was an Islamist militant killed by Russian security forces last year

Threat: The two men in the video, seen here, warn their 'surprise package' will be 'for all the Muslim blood that is shed every day around the world, be it in Afghanistan, Somalia, Syria, all around the world'

An Islamic militant group in Russia's North Caucasus claimed responsibility Sunday for twin suicide bombings in the southern city of Volgograd in December and posted a video threatening to strike the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi.

In the video, two Russian-speaking men warned President Vladimir Putin that 'If you hold these Olympics, we will give you a present for the innocent Muslim blood being spilled all around the world: In Afghanistan, in Somalia, in Syria.'

They added that 'for the tourists who come, there will be a present, too.'

The State Department is advising any Americans traveling to the games to 'remain alert regarding their personal security.'

Members of Congress have expressed concerns about the safety of Americans at the Olympics in Russia and said Moscow needs to cooperate more on security.

Tucker will again be competing in the 500-meter speed skating event on February 10th.

He finished second at the U.S. Olympic Trials, skating two runs in 69.44 seconds to earn his spot. He qualified for his first Olympics in 2006 before pre-qualifying for the 2010 games.

Worries: Russian authorities are doing everything they can to ensure a safe Winter Games, but militants are believed to be responsible for at least three suicide bombings in recent months
