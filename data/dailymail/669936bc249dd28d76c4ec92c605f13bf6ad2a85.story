Five Guantanamo Bay inmates who were held without charge for more than a decade have been released and sent to Kazakhstan.

The men were all captured in Pakistan in the aftermath of 9/11 and accused of links to terror groups including Al-Qaeda, but ended up in legal limbo even after they were cleared to be freed.

One has a chronic heart condition and had a mechanical heart valve fitted in 1999, while another insisted he was just a chef who moved to Pakistan to find a wife.

Two of the men were from Tunisia and were identified as 45-year-old Adel Al-Hakeemy, and Abdallah Bin Ali al Lufti, who military records show is about 49.

The other three, from Yemen, were named as Asim Thabit Abdullah Al-Khalaqi, who is about 46, Muhammad Ali Husayn Khanayna, who is about 36, and Sabri Mohammad al Qurashi, about 44. 

Lufti was
detained in Pakistan and held at Guantanamo for nearly 12 years,
according to a database of government documents compiled by the
New York Times and National Public Radio.

He was accused of links to Tunisian militants when he lived
in Italy in the 1990s, but he denied this.

He has heart problems
that led authorities to recommend his transfer as early as 2004, according to government documents handed to Wikileaks.

He had a mechanical heart valve fitted in 1999 and was on a cocktail of medication including blood thinners. He also had a history of kidney stones and depression, according to the files.

Another of the suspects, Hakeemy, has been the subject of a lengthy campaign by the London-based charity Reprieve, which gave him legal representation.

He had been described by U.S. authorities as a 'veteran terrorist' who had allegedly taken part in fighting in Bosnia and was accused of links with an Algerian Islamist group. 

But the charity said he was just a chef who was trying to find a better life. 

The charity said he lived in Afghanistan with his pregnant wife until they fled the U.S. invasion in 2001. He was then kidnapped by Pakistani forces, handed over to the Americans and tortured.

'Adel has been held without charge in Guantánamo since 2002, despite being cleared for release,' a spokesman said. 'His daughter Hind was born after he was abducted, and he has never seen her.'

The charity said he was born in Tunisia and has four brothers and five sisters. He migrated to Italy in 1985 to work as a chef but moved to Pakistan in the hope of finding a wife who shared his Muslim faith.

His attorney Cori Crider said today: ' All Adel wants now is to regain his health, see his daughter, and start his life again.

'We are very encouraged by this wave of releases at the end of 2014, and hope we see more of the dozens of cleared men left in Guantánamo rejoin their families early next year.'

One of the Yemenis, Khalaqi, 46, had been implicated by John
Walker Lindh, an American captured in late 2001 working with the
Taliban, as having fought with al Qaeda in Afghanistan,
according to the documents. But Khalaqi denied any involvement. 

The U.S. has sent hundreds of prisoners from Guantanamo to third countries, but this is the first time Kazakhstan has accepted any for resettlement.

A on oil-rich majority Muslim country with ties to Russia, it has nevertheless been the subject of several diplomatic negotiations with the U.S.

Controversial: Some 28 prisoners have been released from Guantanamo this year, and 127 remain 

Their release brings the prison population at Guantanamo to 127, according to a Pentagon statement, and the total number of releases in 2014 to 28.

All five men were detained on suspicion of links to al Qaeda or allied groups, but the U.S. official said investigations had determined they 'could be described as low-level, if even that.' 

The government did not say why they could not be sent home, or why exactly Kazakhstan was chosen as their destination.

Officials have been unwilling to send Yemenis to their country because of unrest and militant activity there, while in the past some Tunisians have feared persecution. 

Kazakhstan's acceptance of the five followed extensive negotiations, officials said. 

Other countries that have accepted Guantanamo detainees forresettlement this year include Uruguay, Georgia and Slovakia. 

The transfer of the five men followed a recent pledge by
President Barack Obama for a stepped-up push to shut the
internationally condemned base.

More than half of the remaining Guantanamo detainees are
from Yemen, but Washington is unable to send them home because
of the chaotic security situation there. 

The five former inmates, who were flown on a U.S. military aircraft, arrived in Kazakhstan on Tuesday at 11:15 pm Washington time (4.15am GMT), officials said.
