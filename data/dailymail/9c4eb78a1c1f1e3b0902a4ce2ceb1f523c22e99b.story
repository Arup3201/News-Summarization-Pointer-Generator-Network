The most expensive Lamborghini ever built has gone on sale for a bank-busting £850,000.

Expensive even by supercar standards the incredible Lamborghini Reventon has been inspired by the F22-Raptor fighter jet.

Only 20 were made by the Italian supercar firm between 2007 and 2008.

Design model: The F22-Raptor jet aircraft was the inspiration for the Lamborghini Reventon

And they were never sold on the open market, the company sold them to favoured customers only, merely adding to their exclusive cache.

Design engineers took their styling cues for the sportscar from the angular and sharp lines of the plane.

The stealth dull grey colour of battle has even been extended to the style notes of this rich man's plaything.

It even has a G-Force meter to give the 
driver the impression that they are in the cockpit of a mach two plane 
rather than the driver's seat of a mere supercar.

Lamborghini’s engineers used a massive 6.5-litre V12 engine which develops 650bhp for the car - giving it a 0-62mph time of 3.4 seconds and a top speed 'in excess' of 211mph.

Supercar dealer SuperVettura has now caused a stir among investors looking for a blue chip investment after taking delivery of the UK’s only model.

The Surrey-based specialists are advertising the 2008 Reventon, which cost £800,000 new and has covered just 1,000 miles, for £849,000.

Tommy Wareham, from SuperVettura, said: 'The Lamborghini Reventon cannot be compared to anything else produced by the famous sports cars maker.

'Its exclusivity is second to no other car in the range - it is simply exquisite, encompassing everything Lamborghini stands for.'
