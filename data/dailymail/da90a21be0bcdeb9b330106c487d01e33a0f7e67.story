With so many people unemployed, Costa always expected a healthy response to its search for eight workers to staff a new outlet.

But not quite as healthy as the response it got.

The coffee chain was swamped by 1,700 applications, the equivalent  of 212 for each post at the new shop in Nottingham.

Desperate times: More than 1,700 people applied for just eight jobs at a Costa Coffee branch in Mapperley, Nottingham, pictured - averaging 212 applications for each job

One of the lucky eight: Heather Davies was taken on as a barista at a new Costa cafe in Nottingham after 1,700 people applied for eight jobs

Caffeine hit: Heather Davies said said she felt 'incredibly lucky' to have been taken on at Costa

A company spokesman said there had 
been a ‘wave’ of applications from people who worked for HMV and Clinton
Cards, both of which recently went bust.

Unsuccessful applicants for the vacancies included senior retail managers with more than 15 years’ experience.

Sham Ramparia, Costa’s area manager 
for the Midlands, said he was surprised by the huge number of jobseekers
who wrote in for the posts – three full time and five part time.

‘It just shows how hard times are 
these days,’ he said. ‘There have been a lot of good, high-calibre 
applicants, some with ten to 15 years of experience at the likes of 
Comet and HMV, who are now looking for work because of big companies 
going into administration.

Looking for a job: There are currently nearly 2.5million people out of work in the UK - which is still 185,000 lower than this time last year

‘Many applicants were actually hugely
overqualified. It seems to be a barometer of two things – the way the 
current market is and the strength of our brand.

‘More than 90 per cent of the applicants came from Nottingham and we didn’t have to advertise that extensively either.

‘We listed it on only one job website
and put a sign up on the building while we were renovating it, but the 
applications just came flooding in. I was amazed at the level of 
interest.’

One of the new staff  members at the Mapperley shop is Heather Davies, 25, from the Sherwood area of Nottingham.

‘I feel incredibly lucky to have been taken on. This is the perfect job for me,’ she said.

Many applicants had been made made redundant from the failed music store HMV, which announced the closure of 66 of its 220 stores last month - affecting more than 900 employees

Steven Tomlinson, 25, of Aspley in 
Nottingham, was successful in his application to be a part-time barista –
the name given to coffee shop staff.

‘I’m really excited. I’m hoping to be made full time,’ he said. ‘I’ve always loved coffee so I thought why not go for it?

‘When I heard there were another 
1,000 people going for the job I thought I’d struggle – but I thought 
the interview went really well. Obviously it did. I’m looking forward to
working my way up the chain, it seems a good company to work for.’

The wage for the role of barista varies from £6.10 to £10 an hour. The new cafe, in a former HSBC building, opens on Friday.

Unemployment figures released last month show 2.49million are out of work with 30million others in employment – a record high.

The overall percentage in work has 
fallen slightly however due to  a growing population. Of people aged 16 
to 64, 71.4 per cent have a job, compared with 73 per cent at the 
beginning of 2008.
