A haunted Chicago mini-mansion, once owned by the inventor of barbed wire, has gone on sale for the frighteningly low price of $159,000.

The home, built in 1882, which purportedly witnesses the spirits of children haunting its empty rooms has something of a dark history too.

In 2004, a 19-year-old man named Steven Jenkins was fatally shot during a party in the home and in 2007, a John Wilkes Booth impersonator named Seth Magosky suddenly dropped dead at the age of 39 only six months after buying the fated property.

The Hirum Scutt mansion that's supposedly haunted has been taken off the market but was only originally priced at $159,000

The home which once belonged to Civil
 War Veteran and  barbed wire pioneer Hiram Scutt has become legend in 
the suburb of Joliet - some have reported hearing voices and have felt 
things like 'fingers running through their hair.'

The
 Illinois Paranormal Research Association (IPRA) claims that the doll 
room in the home on the third floor is especially haunted.

And
 while $159,000 may seem low for a 4,960-square-foot, five bedroom home,
 realtor Maria Cronin claims this is because of the renovation work the 
home needs.

She claimed the low price had nothing to do with the mansion's supposed ghostly inhabitants.

At a recent open house, interest was definitely high was 175 people showed up to spend some time in the ghostly mansion.

Some
 were potential buyers, but most were paranormal experts and ghost 
hunters who sought to contact the spirits who may be living in the home.

Paranormal investigators claim that they heard voices inside of the doll room and even felt as though someone or something was touching them

'I didn't know what I was getting into when I took this listing,' Cronin said.  

Spiritual
 and psychic reader Edward Shanahan wrote in 2010 on his Chicago 
Paranormal and Spiritual blog that the mansion is extremely haunted and 
claimed there are compelling videos from multiple paranormal groups as 
alleged proof.

The home's third floor 'doll room' has allegedly been a particular hotspot of paranormal activity.

The Joliet Patch reported that Cronin hopes that whoever buys the mansion will turn in into a bed and breakfast.

The
 mansion has an extremely rich past. After Scutt died in 1889, his son 
Frank took over the home who later sold it to Daniel Watson who turned 
the mansion known as 'Barb Villa' was a girls school and home for women 
who came to the city to work.

When real estate broker Brian Kearney bought the mansion in 2004, he would rent out rooms in the mansion periodically.

In
 2004, Jenkins was shot dead during a party held in one of these rooms 
and in 2007, Magosky died after working to turn the mansion into a 
Victorian museum.

The 'haunted' mansion's real estate agent claimed the mansion's low listing price is based on the amount of work that needs to be done in the space, not because of its history
