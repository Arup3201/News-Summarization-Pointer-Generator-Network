Multi-millionaire property investor: Entrepreneur Paul Bloomfield enjoyed a lavish lifestyle including luxury homes, a helicopter and a private jet

Officials failed to prosecute a multi-millionaire property investor who did not pay any tax for 24 years, it has been claimed.

Entrepreneur Paul Bloomfield enjoyed a lavish lifestyle including luxury homes, a helicopter and a private jet. 

But he did not submit any returns or pay a penny in tax for more than two decades, according to the BBC.

His case was said to be the most extreme to have emerged in Britain since the HSBC scandal was revealed and raised further questions about HM Revenue & Customs’ apparent failure to prosecute tax dodgers.

Mr Bloomfield, nicknamed ‘Boom Boom Bloomfield’ for his series of property deals in the 1980s, was reportedly named in the list of Britons with offshore accounts with HSBC in Switzerland.

BBC1’s Panorama claimed he met HMRC investigators in 2011 – five years after his personal wealth was estimated at £60million – but told them he did not own any property or have any income of his own.

Panorama said it had seen notes of the meeting, which said: ‘Bloomfield confirmed that his living expenses are paid from wherever there is money.

Involvement: Mr Bloomfield helped to arrange finance for the new Wembley Stadium (above) in London in 2003

'In his words there is a box somewhere which contains money and he arranges for the bills to be paid.’

Mr Bloomfield, who helped to arrange finance for the new Wembley Stadium in 2003, claimed an offshore company paid his rent and another firm funded his use of a Boeing 757, a boat and a helicopter.

During his 2011 meeting with HMRC officials, he denied having an offshore bank account, but the HSBC files – given to HMRC by French government officials in 2010 – reportedly revealed he had an offshore account with HSBC in 1993.

Tax officials were said to have disbelieved Mr Bloomfield’s denials about not having any income and concluded he was liable for tax for the past 20 years, but he was not prosecuted.

Ownership: Mr Bloomfield became renowned in the 1980s for buying and selling some of the best known sites in the UK, including Paternoster Square (pictured), near St Paul’s Cathedral

Mr Bloomfield, a friend of well-known property figures such as Gerald Ronson, became renowned in the 1980s for buying and selling some of the best known sites in the UK, including Paternoster Square, near St Paul’s Cathedral.

He was declared bankrupt after a disastrous project during the 1990s property crash, but then bounced back, moving to Russia and reportedly making £158million through deals in former Soviet states. 

He is now believed to be living in Spain. Panorama said he had not responded to its requests for comment.

Former tax inspector Richard Brooks, who now writes on tax matters, said: ‘If you haven’t paid any tax and you’re given a chance by the Revenue to come clean, especially when the amount is on this scale, and you don’t, then you can expect to be prosecuted. That is what you would expect.’

One former business associate of Mr Bloomfield, Mohammad Ghadami, told Panorama: ‘It wasn’t true he had no income, he had a few cars, a few drivers, security, a very expensive wife, an aeroplane. And he had... accountants and lawyers – to work for him.’

The BBC said if HMRC had checked the data about HSBC’s Swiss accounts when it was handed over, officials would have discovered one belonging to Mr Bloomfield and been able to take action years ago.

An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We don’t talk about identifiable taxpayers. We take a wide range of factors into account when deciding the right course of action.’
