A man and woman had a lucky escape after a 60ft landslide saw the clifftop they were sitting on fall away beneath them.

Aimee Jones, 25, and a fellow walker known only as Matt, were sitting on a clifftop bench overlooking Great Western beach in Newquay, Cornwall, when the cliff gave way and 50 tonnes of earth crashed onto the road below.

Miss Jones said she now owes her life to Matt's collie dog Hazel, who she believes alerted them to the crumbling cliff by suddenly bolting from the scene.

Up to 50 tonnes of earth was displaced in the landslide, which occurred at the beauty spot this afternoon

She said: 'We were just sat there chatting when Hazel started sniffing a little crack at the top of the cliff.

'Suddenly she bolted away and both Matt and I got up to see what was happening and that's when the cliff went.

'There was a rumble and a snapping sound and it just fell away.

'It was just a leg's length away from us.

'We both ran as fast as we could – I even twisted my ankle running away from it.

'But it's as if Hazel had a sixth sense. If we'd had stayed where we had been we would have been dragged down.

'I thank my guardian angel - and Hazel.'

Officials said about 50 tonnes of earth was displaced in the landslide, which occurred at the popular beauty spot this afternoon.

The debris fell onto the road and pathway below, causing the road and access to the beach to be completely blocked.

Members of the public are now being warned to take extra care around the area, with police advising people not to go near the site due to the cliff erosion.

Tourists and local residents have been visiting the site this afternoon to see the damage caused by the slide

Inspector Dave Meredith, of Devon and Cornwall Police, confirmed no one was injured in the incident.

He wrote on Twitter: 'Landslide behind Great Western Hotel in Newquay today. Fortunately no one was hurt .

'No access to Great Western Beach Newquay due to landslide (sic).

He later tweeted a photograph of Matt, who managed to escape getting caught up in the landslide.

Mr Meredith wrote: 'Here's Matt & dog Hazel who were sat on a bench above today's landslide in Newquay.

'Slightly shaken but OK!'

It is not yet known what caused the landslide, but Miss Jones believes it could have been triggered as a result of last year's severe storms which hit the South West.

She said an official who arrived to inspect the landslide today told her it that had possibly been caused by water getting into small cracks in the cliff face caused by severe weather.

She said: 'I was told water had got into cracks and expanded when it froze in the recent cold weather.

'The cracks have weakened the cliff until eventually it gave way today.'

Severe storms hit the Westcountry last winter, causing extensive damage across the region including the collapse of the railway line in Dawlish and the evacuation of homes across the South West due to widespread flooding.

Barbara May, manager of the Great Western Hotel in Newquay, said a 'huge chunk' of the hillside had slipped away in today's landslide.

She said: 'There was a wall underneath some benches, I believe some people were sitting on the seats at the time, and the whole area underneath has just slid down onto the lower part of the road.

Police are urging people to stay away from the site, with debris blocking the road and access to the beach

The Environment Agency and Highways Agency are both expected to attend the scene shortly to carry out investigations into what caused the collapse. It is believed to have been caused by erosion following storms

'It's not used by vehicles particularly, unless they've taken a wrong turning and are headed towards the beach.

'It is used by the emergency services, but it's the main footpath down to the beach, so a lot of tourists and local people who are walking dogs use that road regularly.'

The Environment Agency and Highways Agency are both expected to attend the scene shortly to carry out investigations.

One worker at the hotel said there were two police cars at the scene this afternoon, as well as two 'special trucks outside to keep it from sliding any further'.

'The hotel is packed now with people coming for a cup of coffee to have a look at what's happened,' he added.

'At first we thought there must be something in the ocean, so the bar supervisor rushed out and then he came running back in saying "there's been a landslide".

Ian Rabey, bar supervisor at the hotel, added: 'It's messy, but it could have been much worse if it had happened in the summer.

'It's right at the top where the benches are.'

Devon and Cornwall Police said no one was injured in the incident and no properties were damaged as a result. 

Great Western beach is a popular destination for tourists, attracting thousands of people from all over the country each year.

It is situated just a two minute walk from Newquay town centre and is backed by high cliffs. Being on the Atlantic coast, it is also a popular surfing spot, with moderate to large swells attracting keen surfers.
