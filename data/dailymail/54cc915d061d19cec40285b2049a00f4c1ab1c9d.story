A group of mothers in wealthy Beverley Hills, California, is trying to change the perception that drugs and parenting don't mix.

These 'marijuana moms' meet regularly for lavish cannabis-infused dinners. Many of them smoke marijuana several times a day to relax and cope with chronic pain.

They say the drug, which is legal with a prescription in the state of California, makes them better parents and better wives.

Many of the women in the group are married. Most have young children. Some are wealthy stay-at-home mothers. Others work part-time as bartenders or in the service industry. One is the wife of a police officer.

'We've all come up against people who say marijuana is for dirty druggies, but we are proof you can be good parents and productive members of society and use it,' Cheryl Shuman, a 53-year-old mother of two, said.

'I like to think we are bringing some glamor and exclusivity to marijuana use.'

She compared ingesting marijuana on a regular basis to mothers in the 1960s who took 'mother's little helper' pills - Valium - to help them cope with the daily strains of motherhood and running a household. 

'Taking marijuana is just the same, it helps us get through the day,' she said.

Shuman
throws marijuana-themed dinners every month for her friends, most of 
whom are mothers with children. She even enlisted the help of top 
Beverly Hills chef David Schanhals to craft menus.

Past meals have included cannabis leaf salad, chicken fried in cannabis oil and marijuana milk shakes.

Schuman hopes to turn her dinner parties into a business if recreational marijuana use if legalized. Currently, California law only allows people with a prescription to use the drug

Marijuana has been decriminalized since 1975, when the state legislature passed a bill making the possession of the drug a $100 civil fine - not an arrestable offense.

In 1996, California voters passed a bill that legalized marijuana possession for medical purposes. Doctors are allowed to prescribe the drug to anyone with certain chronic medical conditions.

Californians with a prescription can obtain an ID card that allowed the poses, grown and consume the drug. 

Fifty-five percent of voters approved the measure at the time.

However, voters remain opposed to legalizing the recreational use of marijuana.

A 2010 ballot proposition that would have legalized all possession of one ounce of marijuana or less for adults age 21 and over. It would also have allowed for the establishment of marijuana cafes and other businesses.

The measure failed 54percent to 46percent.

Federal law still prohibits the possession and use of marijuana - despite state laws allowing it.

Federal agents have raided marijuana dispensaries and growing operations that are legal under California state law.

After the meal, the women gather to sample new strains of marijuana and smoke together.

January Thomas, 37, says she smokes marijuana five times a day while she looks after her two-year-old daughter Zenna.

She said the drug has become such an important part of her life that she has started to teach her daughter about it.

'Marijuana makes me a better and more creative parent. It puts me in the moment with Zeena and stops me worrying about everyday problems,' she said.

'I want her to understand the benefits of cannabis so I read her books like 'Mommy's Funny Medicine' and 'It's Just a Plant' to teach her.'

Thomas, a part-time
bartender, also takes Zeena to pro-pot rallies with her fiance Magic 
Ellington - who goes by the name Henry Hemp.

Simmi
Dhillon, 40, says marijuana saved her marriage. She was near divorce 
from her police officer husband of 14 years when she smoked pot for the 
first time.

'I was able to be the wife I wanted to be once again and it saved our marriage,' she said.

'Now I can talk to my 10-year-old son about drugs and be completely honest about it.

'Before I was like a zombie on prescription medication - now he's got his mom back.'

All of the women say they started ingesting marijuana as a way to manage chronic pain and illness.

Shuman
overcame ovarian cancer in 2011. Thomas suffers from early-onset 
arthritis and Dhillon is still coping with pain after a car crash ten 
years ago.
