The facial mask, which contains 24 carat gold dust, is on sale on the High Street for £9.99

It is a craze which has seen celebrities and the super-rich splashing out thousands of pounds to have their faces caked in 24 carat luxury.

Undergoing gold facials in a bid to banish wrinkles, however, is an expensive trend out of reach of most ordinary working women.

Until now.

For the first time in the UK a new do-it-yourself face mask, which contains 24 carat gold dust, is going on sale on the High Street for less than a tenner. 

Containing a range of vitamins, minerals and marine algae, the Casmara Gold rejuvenating facial claims to offer all the anti-aging benefits of a boutique salon experience for a fraction of the price at home.

Costing £9.99, the mask is formed by mixing a powder and gel together, before being applied onto the face to create a gold ‘second skin.’ This solidifies and becomes rubbery in texture and is left on the face for 20 minutes.

The gold particles work to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by triggering the replenishment of collagen – the substance vital for giving skin elasticity which depletes with age.

Although some experts are sceptical, others believe gold has the ability to remove bacteria from the face, helping reduce conditions such as acne, as well as promoting lymphatic drainage, thus reducing dark circles under the eyes.

They also say gold can stimulate blood circulation, helping the skin to remove toxins quicker and more efficiently, making for a clearer, more even skin tone.

The mask also contains marine algae, a powerful natural moisturiser, while a combination of vitamins A, C and E work to boost skin thickness and tone, helping to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. The mask also cools the skin as it works, reducing puffiness.

Users are able to peel off the mask from the forehead to the neck in a single piece. It remains active for 24 hours and can be re-used if refrigerated.

They are also encouraged to apply a moisturising cream, which comes as part of the mask kit, beforehand. This contains Aurealis, an active ingredient derived from bitter orange which claims to boost the production of hyaluronic acid – a substance found naturally in the body which can hold up to 3,000 times its weight in water, giving it the ability to quench dry skin, retain moisture and combat wrinkles.

In clinical trials, conducted on 50 women and 25 men, aged between 21 and 66, more than 90 per cent said their skin felt more hydrated for at least 24 hours after using the mask and the same number said it smoothed imperfections and restored their complexion’s natural glow.

Eight out of ten also said their skin felt tighter, smoother and more refined.

Joe Mitchell, beauty innovation buying manager at Boots, where the mask is on sale, said: ‘There are some products that you just have to try as soon as you see them and at Boots we’re always looking to bring these to our customers.

‘Algae is being used in new and interesting ways in beauty, and in looking for breakthrough algae products I found Casmara. It looked totally different to anything I’d seen before, not least because it contains gold. You quickly feel your skin getting colder as it gets to work, and it delivers on its promise of instantly softer skin.’

A BBC documentary last month claimed that celebrities were spending up to £29,000 a year on gold facials.

Hollywood actresses Nicole Kidman and Cameron Diaz are reportedly fans and Brits, including model Lisa Snowdon, TV presenter Donna Air and singer Ellie Goulding have all splashed out on the treatments, which can cost up to £1,000 a time.

Historically, the use of precious metals for beauty goes back centuries. It is said that Cleopatra slept in a gold mask every night, and Chinese empresses supposedly used gold rollers to massage their faces.
