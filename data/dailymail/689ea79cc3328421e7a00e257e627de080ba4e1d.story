Early this morning, two high energy proton beams crossed at the Large Hadron Collider, breaking the world record for energy in such collisions.

The 8 TeV (teraelectronvolt) collisions mark the start of the 'end game' for the Hadron Collider's hunt for the Higgs boson, the ‘God particle’ that would complete Albert Einstein's theory of the universe.

As the LHC's crew declared 'stable beams' it marks the start of a year of experiments that will either find or rule out the existence of the particle.

The LHC is now scheduled to run until the end of 2012, when it will go into its first long shutdown. Scientists are confident the Higgs will be found or ruled out before that point

'The experience of two good years of running at 3.5 TeV per beam gave us the confidence to increase the energy for this year without any significant risk to the machine,' explained CERN1’s Director for Accelerators and Technology, Steve Myers.

'Now it’s over to the experiments to make the best of the increased discovery potential we’re delivering them!'

Higgs particles, if they exist, will  be produced more copiously at 8 TeV than at 7 TeV - the previous operating power of the machine - but background processes that mimic the Higgs signal will also increase.

That means that the full year’s running will still be necessary to convert the tantalising hints seen in 2011 into a discovery, or to rule out the Standard Model Higgs particle altogether.

'The increase in energy is all about maximising the discovery potential of the LHC,' said CERN Research Director Sergio Bertolucci. 'And in that respect, 2012 looks set to be a vintage year for particle physics.'

The LHC is now scheduled to run until the end of 2012, when it will go into its first long shutdown in preparation for running at an energy of 6.5 TeV per beam as of late 2014, with the ultimate goal of ramping up to the full design energy of 7 TeV.

'By the time the LHC goes into its first long stop at the end of this 
year, we will either know that a Higgs particle exists or have ruled out
 the existence of a Standard Model Higgs,' said CERN’s Research 
Director, Sergio Bertolucci in an earlier interview.

'Either would be a major advance in our 
exploration of nature, bringing us closer to understanding how the 
fundamental particles acquire their mass, and marking the beginning of a
 new chapter in particle physics.'
