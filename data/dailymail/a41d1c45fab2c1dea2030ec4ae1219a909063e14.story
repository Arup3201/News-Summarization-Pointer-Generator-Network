Two men who belonged to a witches’ coven that allegedly sexually abused young girls were also into wife swapping, a jury heard today

Peter Petrauske, 72, and 69-year-old Jack Kemp are alleged to have 
been involved in a pagan group of white witches operating in west and 
mid Cornwall from the 1970s.

Today at Truro Crown Court, Kemp’s ex wife Pamela James told the jury 
that she and ‘German Pete’ Petrauske had sex a number of times between 
the early 70s and 80s.

Mrs James, who divorced Kemp after his arrest last December, 
said: 'My husband knew about it, he wanted me to. It was a wife swapping 
stage we went through.'

She said her then husband also slept with another woman in their home in Falmouth, Cornwall, as she she slept downstairs.

She said she knew her husband went to witches’ meetings with ‘German 
Pete’ but she told him she didn’t want to go or to know about it.

She told the court: 'I did go to German Pete’s home and see a lot of 
weird ornaments and statues. And he did read my fortune on the Tarot 
cards but it was all rubbish.'

Victims were allegedly plied with alcohol before being 
ordered to strip naked in front of a crowd of men wearing ceremonial 
robes and who used daggers and wax as part of ritualistic sex abuse.

The allegations of child abuse came to light at a birthday party, said Mrs James, at which a lot of alcohol was consumed and her husband was accused of
rape.

Prosecutor Jason Beal said some of the alleged assaults took the form
of rituals with the victims being made to strip before having their 
wrists bound.

One victim told police of naked children being forced to dance ‘like models’ for the adults who were dressed in robes.

She claimed she was tied to a chair and blindfolded.

She said on another occasion her wrists were bound and a ceremonial dagger was drawn over her body.

Mr Beal said: 'She was taken to a house where pagans were present. Jack Kemp was present and German Pete was also there.

'She was given alcohol, told to dance in front of the camera and take her clothes off. She was given £5 and a bag of sweets.'

Mr Beal said the white witches then exposed themselves and made an indecent proposition.

Petrauske is alleged to have told police he was ‘a white witch, a 
Pagan and not a Christian’ and ‘the high priest of a white witch coven’.

The alleged abuse charges cover a period of more than 30 years from the late 1970s to 2009.

Kemp faces 15 charges of sexual assault 
on youngsters aged between three and 15, and Petrauske faces one rape 
and indecent assault charges. Both deny the charges.

The trial continues.

Hearing: The trial of the two men at Truro crown court is expected to last four weeks
