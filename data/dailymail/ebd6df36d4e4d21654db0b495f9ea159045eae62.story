When it comes to bikini competition day, the harshest judges are the beauty queens themselves.

Sources told the New York Post that Miss New York Nina Davuluri called current Miss America Mallory Hagan 'fat as [expletive]'.

After winning the Miss New York competition on July 16, Ms Davuluri invited friends back to her hotel room to celebrate, and that's when another competitor overheard her slinging insults at Ms Hagan.

When the conversation turned offensive, a beauty queen in an adjoining room started to record the conversation.

In addition to the fat comment, friends of Ms Davuluri can be heard making racist comments. Ms Davuluri is the first Indian-American to serve as Miss New York and has nicknamed herself 'Miss Diversity'.

Following the incident, Ms Davuluri apologized for her friends' comments on Facebook, but said she did nothing wrong.

'I want to apologize for the awful statements made by people in my room...There were people who claimed to be my supporters and said things I never agreed with, nor supported,' Ms Davuluri wrote. 'I was never a part of the words or statements that may have been hurtful...I'm sorry if someone said something that was inappropriate.'

A representative for Ms Hagan said that the situation was investigated in July and that there is 'no validity to the story whatsoever.

'Miss New York spoke to Mallory Hagan to let her know there was no validity and to apologize if she was offended in any way,' the rep said.

Ms Hagan was photographed on a beach in Hawaii this past spring, having put on a few pounds since being crowned Miss America.

She addressed her weight gain on Anderson Cooper Live saying: 'Well you know I think that I am human I like to equate getting ready for the Miss America pageant to getting ready for a boxing match. We get in shape and then afterwords life goes back to normal.'

Post-competition: Pictures taken of Ms Hagan on vacation in Hawaii last March show that she's filled out a little since the competition 

She stressed that being healthy is all about balance.

'It's all about being healthy, we're all about living a healthy lifestyle. Some days you want to eat potatoes and some days you don't.'

And Ms Davuluri herself wasn't always as svelte as she looked in last Tuesday's swimsuit competition.

The Central New Yorker told the Syracuse Post-Standard that she was 60 pounds heavier during her final semesters at the University of Michigan and struggled with bulimia.

One day she looked at a picture of herself and finally realized just how much weight she had put on. She thought to herself: 'This is not who I want to be, and it is not the way I want to portray myself to the world.'

So upon entering the beauty pageant world, she got a personal trainer and started eating healthy.

She said she doesn't give out her weight,  fearing that other women would try to make that their goal.

However, she says her current weight is hardly what she'd define as 'skinny'.

Both Ms Hagan and Ms Davuluri have competed in past Miss New York competitions together. Ms Davuluri was second runner-up the year that Miss Hagan was crowned Miss New York and went on to win Miss America.

The new Miss America will be crowned this Sunday.
