The six-year-old daughter of supermodel Natalia Vodianova has landed her first modelling job.

Neva, who is the second of the Russian-born beauty's three children with ex-husband Justin Portman, poses in a red dress for childrenswear label Caramel Baby and Child.

She follows in the footsteps of Cindy Crawford's daughter Kaia, ten, who shot her first campaign recently for Versace.

Mini mum: Natalia Vodianova's six-year-old daughter, Neva, models a dress made to support her Naked Heart Foundation charity

Neva has modelled alongside her 
30-year-old mum for Vogue on several occasions, however this ad 
for Caramel Baby and Child is her first solo fashion shoot.

The six-year-old models the dress, which was made specifically for Ms Vodianova's charity the Naked Heart Foundation, with freshly 
picked flowers in a spring garden looking vaguely solemn.

A possible 
reflection of the charity's serious cause, or the result of a little 
girl who would rather be playing than staring at a camera.

Ms Vodianova is also mother to sons, Lucas, 10, and Viktor, 5, and is currently dating Antoine Arnault.

Mr Arnault is the head of communications for luxury brand Louis Vuitton, and son of LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault.

All proceeds from the sale of Neva's dress will go to the Naked Heart Foundation, which was founded by the mother-of-three.

Tthe Naked Foundation aids underprivileged children 
in Russia through the provision of recreational facilities and 
financial assistance, to help with their medical care.

Ms Vodianova was inspired to found the charity after visiting Russia with her son 
Lucas, where there were no suitable places for children to play.

The organisation built its first playground in 2006 in Nizhny Novgorod, and it has since built nearly 38 more.

Made from 100per cent cashmere, the red crochet dress costs £225 (US$365) for the child's version.

The adult version retails for £380 (US$615), and the matching collar will be available for £45 (US$73).

The dress will be available to order from May 6 by calling +44 207 352 8857. Alternatively, it will go on sale at the end of June in Caramel Baby and Child 
stores and selected Department stores worldwide.
