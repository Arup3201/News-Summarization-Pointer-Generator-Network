Mississippi is officially the fattest state in the country, with almost 36 per cent of its residents falling under the classification.

The slimmest state is Colorado but even there 21 per cent of people are unhealthily overweight.

As the obesity epidemic continues more than a third of the population in 12 U.S. states are clinically obese.

Shocking: There are now 12 states where obesity levels are at 30 per cent or more

Heavy weight: People with a BMI of 30 or more are considered to be obese

Other offenders include Louisiana, with a rate of 33.4 per cent, West Virginia where the total is 32.4 per cent and Alabama with 32% of its population labeled obese.

Of the 30 states with the highest obesity rates 26 are in the Midwest and South, with many of the healthier states being found along the east coast, including New York, Massachusetts and the District of Columbia.

The study, carried out by the Trust for America's Health (TFAH) and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, was conducted over the phone.

It is the first of its kind to include households without landline telephones, bringing in a larger proportion of the population.  

Its findings were released on Monday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on body mass index calculations. 

Epidemic: Rising levels of obesity is a major problem sweeping the United States

People with a BMI of 30 or more are considered to be obese and are at risk of serious health defects.

'Obesity has contributed to a stunning rise in chronic disease rates and health care costs. It is one of the biggest health crises the country has ever faced,' said Jeffrey Levi, PhD, TFAH executive director.

'The good news is that we have a growing body of evidence and approaches that we know can help reduce obesity, improve nutrition and increase physical activity based on making healthier choices easier for Americans.

'The bad news is we're not investing anywhere near what we need to in order to bend the obesity curve and see the returns in terms of health and savings.'

The report comes as the U.S. launches initiatives to try to lower the number of dangerously overweight Americans. 

In New York mayor Bloomberg banned trans-fat in a move that has since been copied by more than a dozen other state and local governments. He has also banned soft drinks bigger than 16oz.

An Atlanta ad campaign featured images of overweight children with slogans such as 'chubby kids may not outlive parents' to try to promote healthy eating and across the country $70 million in federal funding is available to help states and communities address the root causes of obesity.

Monday's report comes as it is revealed that one in five schoolchildren are obese, with the onus being put on schools to set in place stricter junk food regulations.

The latest report on obesity-related medical bills, from 2011, found that in 2006 costs totaled $147 billion, the majority of which was spent treating diseases such as diabetes. 

Experts fear this cost could soar if intervention is unsuccessful. 

'Our nation has made important inroads to creating healthier communities,' said Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, MD, RWJF president and CEO.

Rising: Obesity levels have soared since 2004, when there were no states with a rate of 30 per cent or more

In the past few years the rates have soared, giving need for a 'more than 35%' category in the 2012 map that wasn't there before

'Some cities and states that have taken comprehensive action to address the epidemic are beginning to see declines in their obesity rates. But we need to expand and intensify our efforts. Investing in prevention today will mean a healthier tomorrow for our children.'

Later this summer RWJF and TFAH will release the annual report F as in Fat, analysing state obesity rates and policy efforts to address the epidemic, as well as recommendations. 

It will include details on where costs could be saved from citizens achieving a mere five per cent BMI reduction. 

For a six-foot-tall person weighing 200 pounds, a 5 per cent reduction in BMI would be the equivalent of losing roughly 10 pounds.

The report will also, for the first time, forecast 2030 obesity rates in each state and the likely resulting rise in obesity-related disease rates and health care costs.

Until 2005 no states had a 30 per cent or more obesity rate. Since 2009 the issue has intesified, with soaring numbers tipping the scales at dangerous levels.
