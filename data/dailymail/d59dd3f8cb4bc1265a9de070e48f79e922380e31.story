Crystal Palace have announced the signing of Liverpool defender Martin Kelly on a three-year contract.

The 24-year-old made his Reds debut back in 2009 but found first-team opportunities limited, with a serious knee injury also ruling him out for a year.

Kelly and his representatives held talks with Palace officials on Monday and wrapped up the deal Tuesday morning.
