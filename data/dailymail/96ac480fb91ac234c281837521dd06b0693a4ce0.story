This is the terrifying moment a driver was caught on camera driving the wrong way around a busy roundabout.

Driving instructor David Tomlinson, 51, was on his way home after a lesson when he was forced to swerve out the way of the silver Renault Megane.

The near-miss took place at Cheriton roundabout in Folkestone, Kent, and was caught on Mr Tomlinson's dashboard camera.

Driving instructor David Tomlinson, 51, said he was forced to swerve out of the way after the vehicle drove towards him on Cheriton roundabout in Folkestone, Kent. His dashcam recorded the vehicle's movements

Mr Tomlinson, a father of two, said the driver was in his late 60s and could have been confused after returning from the continent.

He said: 'It would be understandable if it was a foreign driver but it wasn't a foreign car.

'The roundabout is quite near Dover so maybe they had just come back from France and forgot they were on the wrong side of the road.

'He was driving at about 30mph. He just had a normal expression on his face, he didn't look panicked or anything.

'It was pretty lucky that there was nobody in the left hand lane as the guy wasn't stopping and it could have been a pretty bad accident.'

Mr Tomlinson said he keeps a dashcam in his car to help show those who he teaches to drive the mistakes they made. He said he was able to keep calm during the incident because of his years working as a driving instructor.

He said: 'Doing the job that I do I think I'm used to these things happening unfortunately. 

'I’m just glad that at the time there wasn’t a learner in the car because it probably would’ve put them off driving. 

The father of two said the driver appeared unfazed after driving the wrong way around the busy roundabout

'It could’ve been a lot worse, if there had been a car in the lane I needed to move into, I wouldn’t have been able to pull across. He just kept on coming.

'The problem with the roundabout is its quite big and fast, so cars go around about 25-30mph. 

'If that left lane had been blocked I would’ve been involved in a head-on or a side swipe. But luckily I was able get out of the way.

'It’s a very good system to use in the car, and it records in HD. It’s normally used to help my pupils, if they’ve made a mistake, I can show them the footage so they can see what they’ve done.
