Jubilant scenes are expected in Belgium tomorrow as the nation prepares to welcome a new monarch.

But the day King Albert II will officially hand the throne to his son Crown Prince Phillippe comes as the soon-to-be ex-monarch, 79, is embroiled in a paternity scandal that has resurfaced after more than a decade.

Artist Delphine Boël, 45, insists she is the daughter of King Albert, and has now launched legal proceedings in a bid to prove she is a member of the Belgian royal family through DNA tests.

The palace has remained tight-lipped on Ms Boël's claims, but her efforts to use the courts to force the king to provide a DNA sample has dominated the headlines in Belgian newspapers and magazines.

'This is a private affair, and we have no comment whatsoever,' spokesman Bruno Neve told the International Herald Tribune.

It was first revealed that Albert fathered an illegitimate child in a book published in 1999, and middle-aged artist Ms Boël is adamant that she is the child in question.

She has given a series of interviews with the media in both Belgium and France, insisting she is driven by the desire for vindication rather than any claim on the king's fortune.

'I am deeply saddened, but I believe blood can work wonders,' she was quoted as saying last month.

'I don't believe that my legal action will end all discrimination against me or my family, or mend my personal relationship with my father, but with DNA proof there will be undeniable certainty about my identity,' she said in a statement as she launched legal proceedings.

To date two court hearings have taken place - both behind closed doors.

Ms Boël's mother, Sybile de Selys Longchamps, has backed her daughter's efforts to have her alleged royal lineage recognised, and says she had an affair with the king lasting 18 years.

Albert's marriage to Queen Paola is understood to have been turbulent at times, with the couple spending long spells living apart over the years and coming close to divorce in the past.

The royal family will no doubt be hoping Ms Boël's statements both in and out of the Brussels courtroom - among the artist's creations is a sculpture comprising the words 'love' and 'child' separated by a heart topped with a crown - will not overshadow tomorrow's historic occasion.

Belgium's political and social elite will gather to see the monarch sign a declaration of abdication and his son Prince Phillippe, 53, will be sworn in as Belgium's new king.
