Luckless Bayern Munich midfielder Thiago Alcantara has suffered a new setback in his attempt to return from a knee injury that had kept him out since March.

The 23-year-old has partially torn ligaments in his right knee - the one he initially injured  - in training and requires surgery to rectify the problem.

'What can I say? Obviously I am deeply disappointed and frustrated. Why always me? But I will not give up. I will continue to fight,' Alcantara said in a statement.

The midfielder has five caps for Spain but was prevented from adding to that in the World Cup this year, when a return to training in May proved too soon and only aggravated the initial problem.

He has received support from former Barcelona team-mate Marc Bartra, who posted a picture of the duo on Instagram with the message 'You'll come back, like you always do. Optimism and much encouragement @Thiago6! Hug.'

It is not known exactly how long Alcantara's new injury will rule him out for.

The midfielder joined former Barcelona manager Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich in July last year, turning down a switch to Manchester United.

But it seems Alcantara is set for another season that will be disrupted by injuries after his latest setback.Â
