Gareth Bale may have followed in the footballing footsteps of David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo when signing for Real Madrid last summer but it seems the frontman is also taking inspiration from the superstar duo in the fashion stakes.

The international, who is missing from this summer's World Cup after Wales failed to qualify, took time out for a round of golf at the Pebble Beach course in California - sporting an Alice band.

The former Tottenham star posted a snap of himself at the golf resort to his Instagram account and said: 'Great two rounds at Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill with the boys!!'

Inspiration? Bale was snapped sporting an alice band similar to those worn by Cristiano Ronaldo (left) and David Beckham (right) in the past

Bale, who helped Real Madrid achieve 'La Decima' last season, visited Indonesia at the start of the month in a personal promotional tour of Jakarta.

The 24-year-old was forced to miss Holland's World Cup warm-up game with Wales three days later with a leg injury.
