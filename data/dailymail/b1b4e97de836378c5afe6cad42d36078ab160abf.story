The New York prosecutor who handled the case in which a white police officer was cleared in the chokehold death of Eric Garner has announced he is running for Congress.

Staten Island District Attorney Daniel Donovan issued a statement saying he is formally seeking the endorsements of the Republican, Conservative and Independence parties.

He said that since he first expressed interest, 'The enthusiasm for my candidacy has only broadened and intensified.'

Cases: He oversaw the grand jury process which saw a white police cleared of killing Eric Garner, 43, in a chokehold in July in Staten Island 

Donovan's announcement did not mention the July 17 death of Eric Garner, 43, after scuffling with officers who were arresting him for selling untaxed cigarettes. Amateur video showed an officer holding Garner around the neck as Garner gasped, 'I can't breathe.'

A Staten Island grand jury decided against indicting the policeman, and Garner's death, like that of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, touched off nationwide protests. 

They were cited by a gunman who murdered two New York City police officers last month.

Donovan said when the officer was cleared that the grand jury found 'no reasonable cause' to charge him. 

His spokeswoman, Madelaine St. Onge, said Friday the campaign had no further comment on the Garner case.

A call to the Rev. Al Sharpton, a leader of protests after Garner's death, was not immediately returned.

No date has been set yet for the special election, made necessary by the resignation of Rep. Michael Grimm after he pleaded guilty to tax evasion charges. Candidates are to be chosen by parties or through petitions.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said in a statement that electing Donovan would create 'another political sideshow.'

Republican state Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis has also expressed interest in the congressional seat.  Potential Democratic candidates include state Assemblyman Michael Cusick and former U.S. Rep. Michael McMahon, who lost to Grimm in 2010.

Donovan's previous experience in politics extends back to 2010 when he ran for state attorney general and lost to Democrat Eric Schneiderman.

He is best known, however, for prosecuting a police officer who put Staten Island resident Eric Garner in a choke hold, contributing to his death.

A grand jury's decision not to bring charges against the law enforcement officer earlier this month incited national protests and the 'I Can't Breathe' movement - Garner's now famous last words.

Donovan's failure to convince the jury to allow the district attorney's office to move forward with its case has angered the city's African-American population. However, blacks made up just under 10 percent of the borough's population as of the last census.
