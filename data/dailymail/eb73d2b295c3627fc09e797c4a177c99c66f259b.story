Teaching assistant Emma Webb, 44, from Bracknell, Berkshire, had sex with two teenagers at her home and in her car in a 'disgraceful' abuse of power

A married teaching assistant who got two schoolboys to skip lessons to have sex with her has avoided prison because she had already served time for having affairs with five other pupils.

Mother-of-two Emma Webb had sex with the boys at home while her husband was out, and performed a sex act on one of them in an empty maths classroom.

The 44-year-old also lured the ‘inexperienced’ boys, then aged 15 and 16, into her car for sex in a ‘disgraceful’ abuse of her position, a court heard.

The blonde began a fling with the 16-year-old after being assigned as his support worker following the death of his brother. In a text message, she told him: ‘If I was younger I’d be the girl for you.’

She then offered him a lift home and touched him while they were struck in traffic, before driving to a deserted car park and performing a sex act on him.

Prosecutor Michael Roques told a judge at Reading Crown Court how Webb also began a fling with the 15-year-old after sending him ‘flirty’ texts. After luring him into the maths room and performing a sex act on him, she invited the schoolboy to her home for sex while her husband was at work.

The court heard how, on another occasion, she drove the youngster to a secluded area of woodland, where they had sex in the back of her car.

The judge, Recorder John Gallagher, heard how the boy had been reluctant to report the affair because he feared reprisals from Webb’s husband, who was a karate black belt.

Webb wept as she was told she would not go to jail for the flings, which came to light following her suspension from the school.

In 2012, she was jailed for 32 months after admitting to affairs with five other pupils at the same Berkshire school, which cannot be named for legal reasons.

Her barrister Lucy Tapper told the court that Webb was now in a relationship with another man.

Miss Tapper added: ‘She’s somebody who is determined to put these incidents behind her and is determined to move on with her life.’ Judge Gallagher told Webb that she was only avoiding prison because she had already been punished for offences that had taken place at the same time.

He said: ‘You disgracefully abused your position of trust.

‘I accept that you had your own problems but the truth is that ultimately it was for your own gratification and you ignored the needs of these two boys.’

But Webb was spared jail at Reading Crown Court (pictured) because she has already served time in jail for after admitting 30 offences involving five other pupils, which took place at the school at the same time

He told Webb the 15-year-old’s grades had deteriorated because she encouraged him to skip lessons for sex, adding: ‘It undoubtedly affected his schooling and the reality is you abused his innocence, because he had no previous sexual experience.’

Judge Gallagher said the 16-year-old had also been badly affected by her behaviour. He added: ‘You were specifically his mentor.

‘A mentor is somebody who is meant to be getting a young person into the right way of behaving and the right way of treating others. What you did was precisely the opposite.

‘The fact is this is your last chance, there can be no more of this.’

Webb, of Bracknell, Berkshire, admitted 12 counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust and was handed a 15-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. She was also given a two-year supervision order.
