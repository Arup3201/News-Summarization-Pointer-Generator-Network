Sales of the Italian sparkling wine prosecco are soaring, with one major retailer, Majestic Wine, reporting a 39 per cent increase in sales.

Some say it’s because of our squeezed wallets: the cheapest bottle of champagne costs around £14 while prosecco can be as little as £6.50.

But there is also evidence that we Brits actually prefer the taste of the North-East Italian-made fizz.

Lovely bubbly: There is evidence that we Brits actually prefer the taste of North-East Italian-made prosecco to French Champagne

‘People like prosecco because it’s less acidic than champagne,’ explains Russell Norman, proprietor of Italian restaurant chain Polpo.

But he adds: ‘It must not be seen as a poor man’s champagne — it is a very different and distinctive drink.’

The bubbles behave differently for a start: in champagne, they quickly disappear after it has been poured; good-quality prosecco has a persistent foam on the surface that gives it a special creaminess.

The lower price of prosecco, and its Spanish rival cava, is due to the less intensive production method used compared with champagne. For the French add yeast to each bottle to create a second fermentation that gives the wine its particular fizz.

Prosecco, on the other hand, is 
usually made using the ‘Charmat’ process, where the second fermentation 
takes place in a vat, cutting the cost of production.

A
 version of prosecco has been made in Northern Italy for more than 400 
years. Originally, it was marketed as a health drink. But it was not 
until the Sixties, when its sugariness was reduced, that the British 
acquired a taste for it.

According to Mr Norman, Italians favour ‘extra dry’ while we prefer the less sweet ‘brut’.

Since
 the vogue for rustic Italian food, popularised by TV chefs Jamie Oliver
 and Antonio Carluccio, took over our kitchens, prosecco has become 
undeniably chic.

Whereas
 once it would have been regarded as cheap or naff to serve a sparkling 
white at a wedding in place of champagne, prosecco has become the 
stylish, unexpected alternative.

Here, we put a selection to the test. 

Prosecco Superiore Extra Dry (Valdobbiadene),  £7.29

A
 pleasant straw colour, with a slight earthy scent and light, sweet 
citrus flavours.

But it lacks the classic flowery tones that would have 
given the wine more character.

Verdict: Good value, but the flavours are a little too faint.

Extra Special Prosecco Brut (Treviso), £6.50

A
 good foam on the surface and the wine continued to bubble happily long 
after pouring. Flavour is between sharp apple and peach.

Verdict: One of the lowest-priced wines, this is the best value for money and best for those who prefer a less sweet taste.

Bella Cucina Prosecco Extra Dry, £6.99

A
 pale coloured wine, lacking the subtle sunshine tint typical in a 
prosecco.

Didn’t bubble as pleasingly as some of the others 
but the warm, toasty flavours of this sweeter wine were delightful.

Verdict: Great-looking rustic bottle and enough character to want to pour another glass. Best for everyday Italian dinners.

Valdo Oro Puro Extra Dry (Valdobbiadene), £8.65

A
 very persistent foam which didn’t go flat even when left standing, 
energetic bubbles and a good prickly, fizzy texture on the palate.

Plenty of sweet orchard fruit flavours.

Verdict: Might be too sweet 
for some tastes but excellent quality. Best for mixing with peach juice 
for a sparkling Bellini cocktail.

Follador Superiore 2012 Extra Dry, £15

A
 pretty, pale gold wine with excellent effervescence providing lots of 
movement on the palate. Floral-scented, with a hint of elderflower in 
the flavour.

Verdict: A luxurious wine that looked and tasted 
superior to many of the others. At the same price as cheap Champagne, 
this is more than a match for its French rival. Best for prosecco
 connoisseurs.

Prosecco Superiore Extra Dry (Conegliano Valdobbiadene), £7.29

A
 pale-coloured wine with an initially healthy foam that subsided 
disappointingly quickly.

The flavour was a little robust, almost with 
tones of brandy.

Verdict: Great if you like a sparkler with a little fire and punch. 

Zardetto Extra Dry (Conegliano), £11.99

White
 with a creamy froth and the right stinging fizz you look for in an 
exciting prosecco. Flavours were gentle and very classic.

Verdict: All the qualities you’d hope for in prosecco, though perhaps too subtle for some, this is the best luxury buy.

Majestic Wine — Prosecco Zonin Brut, £11.99

The
 most vigorous fizzer of all, with fast-moving bubbles that prickled on 
the palate.

The flavour is not that of a classic prosecco — more like a 
rounded, dry white wine.

Verdict: All the vitality and quality you need in a party wine. Best when you want to impress

Prosecco Special Cuvee Brut, £6.49

A
 plodding fizz that never quite sparked, and of all the Brut wines, the 
one with the strongest acidity on the palate.  A taste of sharp lemons, 
even limes, threatened to be overpowering, but a little floral hint 
comes to the rescue.

Verdict: The cheapest sample and not the best, but it has a certain charm.

Prosecco (Ora), £9.99

There’s
 no indication on the bottle to show if this is an extra-dry or brut 
wine, and it is so spare and delicate that it is not easy to tell.

Slight lemony flavours, but otherwise quite mild.

Verdict: I wanted 
this wine to be as rich as its golden colour, but it will suit the 
sweet-averse drinkers and serve as a useful mixer for cocktails.
