Tyra Banks is known for two things: being one of the world's most famous supermodels and inventing 'smizing' - or the act of smiling with your eyes.

But one photographer is hoping to give Tyra a run for her money with what he claims is 'the most incredible tip for looking photogenic' - the Squinch.

Portraitist Peter Hurley claims the squinch is
the act of squinting your eyes in such a way as to ooze confidence
 and self-assuredness.

Does it really work? Portraitist Peter Hurley thinks that 'squinching' (R) makes you look more photogenic

He believes that this will make you look far more attractive than staring wide-eyed into the camera, which portrays fear and uncertainty.

So how can you squinch without looking constipated?

Firstly, Hurley emphasises that squinching isn’t the same as squinting and while the difference may be minor, it is vital.

When you squint, your top and bottom eyelids close, which, Hurley believes makes you look far from confident.

More photogenic after? The trick is to lift and tighten the lower eyelid and only allow the top eyelid to come down slightly (R)

When you ‘squinch,’ however, you’re lifting and tightening the lower eyelid and only allowing the top eyelid to come down slightly.

Speaking in his video, he says: 'If you're a photographer out there, make your people squinch. And if you're a human being who just wants to look hot, this is going to do it for you.

'Want to know why? Because confidence comes from the eyes.'

Top tip: He says the most important trick is to avoid squinting and only lower your top eyelid slightly

The last time Hurley, a New York and Los Angeles based photographer specialising in advertising and commercial work, unveiled a tutorial on how to look picture perfect by accentuating your jawline, it went viral.

He showed viewers how to accentuate the jawline by showing their good side, avoid laughing, titling their head and locking eyes with the camera - and it got over a million hits.

Is the squinch going to add a whole new dimension to the selfie?
