Manchester United vs Liverpool (Old Trafford) 

Team news

Manchester United 

Angel di Maria will miss Manchester United's crunch match against Liverpool on Sunday.

United's record signing has missed the last two games with a hamstring injury and will not be in the match day squad this weekend, manager Louis van Gaal confirmed at his pre-match press conference on Friday.

The good news for Van Gaal is that defenders Rafael and Phil Jones are both back from their long-term groin and shin injuries. 

Liverpool

Striker Mario Balotelli is back in training and could return to the squad for Sunday's trip to Manchester United.  

The Italy forward has been sidelined since November 8 because of a groin problem sustained on international duty.

Midfielder Adam Lallana will be in the squad despite breaking two ribs just over a week ago while centre-back Kolo Toure is expected to have recovered from a groin injury which kept him out of the midweek Champions League draw against Basle.

Provisional squad: Mignolet, Johnson, Lovren, Skrtel, Moreno, Lucas, Henderson, Lallana, Gerrard, Sterling, Lambert, Jones, Manquillo, Enrique, Toure, Can, Coutinho, Allen, Markovic, Balotelli, Borini.
