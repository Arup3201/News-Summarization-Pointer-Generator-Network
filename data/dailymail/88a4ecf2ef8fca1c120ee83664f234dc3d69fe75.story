Attack: Tory MEP Sajjid Karim criticised the 'anti-EU Taliban' in Conservative ranks who refuse to allow anyone to believe Britain should stay in the Eu

Eurosceptic Conservatives behave like the 'Taliban' towards other members of their party who do not want to sever ties with Brussels, a Tory MEP claimed today.

Sajjid Karim made the explosive claim about his Tory colleagues who he claimed will not allow anyone to hold a view 'unless it's the same view as them'.

His intervention came as David Cameron warned public support for the European Union as it stands today is ‘wafer-thin’.

The Prime Minister claimed the economy would face more uncertainty if the country ‘put your head in the sand’ and pretended there was not a problem with Europe.

He insisted Britain was better off staying in a reformed European Union, than leaving altogether.

However, party unity over Europe was blown apart by the outspoken attack by Mr Karim on hardline Conservatives who want Britain to quit the EU.

Writing on Twitter during a debate on Europe, he said: 'It seems the anti-EU taliban find it difficult to accept a different point of view!'

He added: 'The ANTI-EU TALIBAN don't want an informed British public or an informed debate. Bring it on!'

Mr Karim later insisted he had not used the term lightly, adding: 'That's exactly what they are.'

'You are no longer allowed to hold a view unless it's the same view as them,' he told Huffington Post.

Mr Cameron has promised to renegotiate
a ‘fresh settlement’ with the EU after the next election before staging
an in-out vote before the end of 2017.

But
his policy suffered a major blow yesterday after an official government
review found the UK’s relationship with Brussels was ‘broadly 
appropriate’.

The 
Prime Minister’s historic claim to have helped secure a cut in the EU’s 
long-term budget was also criticised today by peers who said it is ‘not 
as good as it looks’ because too many other concessions have been made.

Uncertainty: David Cameron insisted business was still investing in the UK ahead of his promised EU referendum, as he visited the Bentley factory in Crewe where he met Bentley chairman and chief executive Dr Wolfgang Schreiber (left), apprentice engineer James Bate, and chairman of the board of the Volkswagen Group Dr Martin Winterkorn

A Tory-drafted Bill promising a referendum is being piloted through Parliament by MP James Wharton, but stands little chance of becoming law because both Labour and the Lib Dems oppose it.

Today Mr Cameron was challenged over whether the uncertainty of an in-out vote by 2017 would deter big businesses from investing in Britain.

Levels of immigration to Britain creates a 'constant drain' on public services, David Cameron suggested.

The Prime Minister was asked during the Q&A session at the Bentley factory why the UK opens its doors to foreigners who are a 'constant drain' while others 'work hard'.

Mr Cameron replied: 'I basically agree with you. There are some benefits from being a country that welcomes people who want to come here and work hard.

'But in the last decade we have had an immigration policy that's completely lax.

'The pressure it puts on our public services and communities is too great.'

He added that he wanted to see net migration 'coming down faster'.

'On housing, health, education and legal aid we are showing we are not a soft touch,' he said.

Speaking at a PM Direct Q&A session at a Bentley car plant in Crewe, the prime minister replied: ‘I think a greater uncertainty would be to put your head in the sand and pretend there isn't a problem with Europe.

‘There is a problem and I'm going to fix it,’ he added.

Mr Cameron went on: 'Europe is changing and Europe needs to change.  It’s 28 countries, 18 of which have the same currency – the euro – the other ten of which, like us, don’t. 

'So, I’m saying to them, "You need to sort your stuff out, and we’ll allow you to do that because you need to."

'But at the same time, those countries like Britain where, frankly, consent for the European Union is wafer thin – we need changes, too. 

So, we’ll give you your changes if you give us our changes.  I believe I can negotiate that.'

However a new government study that says membership of the European Union is beneficial for Britain was last night branded a ‘Whitehall whitewash’.

Despite uncovering a catalogue of problems, the Foreign Office review found that the balance of power between Brussels and Westminster was ‘broadly appropriate’.

The report sparked anger among Tory backbenchers, who questioned why it was commissioned in the first place since the conclusions appear to contradict Mr Cameron’s policy of renegotiating Britain’s relationship with Brussels.

Doubts were also raised about the deal to cut the EU’s budget, secured by Mr Cameron against expectations that Britain could pull off a spending reduction.

Changes agreed earlier this month in the way the cash can be distributed between years, including rolling over unspent funds, are storing up problems for the future, peers told Treasury Minister Greg Clark.

At the House of Lords sub-committee on EU finances, independent peer Lord Kerr claimed increased contributions to this year's single-year budget could hit the longer term agreement, known in Brussels jargon as the multi-annual financial framework (MFF).

Lord Kerr said: ‘My feeling is you have built up a problem for the future here because in order to get the parliament to agree to the MFF numbers you have given them, in the budget for this year, an extra £7.5 billion and if expenditure in each of the years of the MFF was at the level set from this year the MFF ceilings would be broken.'

But Mr Clark insisted the UK had opposed the amending budgets to the single-year budget but was outvoted.

He said: ‘We opposed the amending budgets. They reflected an argument that was made that there were bills unpaid that we felt should have been paid through redeployments but we were outvoted.’

The £822 billion MFF was backed by the European Parliament earlier this month after intense negotiations.

It followed a fractious round of talks to get an agreement by governments in February, with Britain and Germany among states pushing for a real-terms cut in the face of opposition from countries that are net beneficiaries.
