As the front man of the band These New Puritans, George Barnett is used to being adored by groupies. But what would actor Bradley Cooper say if he found out that the latest girl to fall for George's rock and roll charm was his girlfriend Suki Waterhouse?

The 21-year-old British actress is seen getting up close with a bare-chested George before he goes on stage to perform in front of a cheering crowd. But lucky for Bradley, 38, it's all for Burberry's latest campaign to promote their new men's fragrance, Brit Rhythm.

George, 25, is dating Pixie Geldof, 22, in real life and thanks to him being a musician with a background in modelling, he was deemed the perfect choice to front Burberry's music-inspired campaign.

The model shows off his toned body at the start of the video, spraying himself with the fragrance before pulling on a white T-shirt and leather jacket and grabbing his guitar.

The sexy video is sure to win George some new fans but Bob Geldof's daughter Pixie was won over by his charms three years ago.

adrenaline of live music and the electric energy of the crowd.'
