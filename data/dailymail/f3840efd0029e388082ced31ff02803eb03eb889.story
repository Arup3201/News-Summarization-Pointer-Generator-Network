The calls for Arsene Wenger to leave his post as Arsenal manager strengthened on Saturday, with travelling supporters at The Hawthorns for their team's game against West Brom unravelling a banner demanding his immediate departure.

Fans held up a sign that read 'Arsene, thanks for the memories but it's time to say goodbye' during Arsenal's 1-0 win at West Brom.

Another supporter protested by holding a sign saying 'Enough is enough, Wenger out.'

A Danny Welbeck header meant Arsenal took all three points on Saturday against West Brom

Arsenal have begun the season in an unconvincing manner, and a 2-1 home defeat last weekend to Manchester United has left many fans questioning whether Arsenal can ever again reach the heights that they once hit under Wenger's guidance.

But the Frenchman has overseen two victories since that loss.

Before the West Brom win, Arsenal beat Borussia Dortmund 2-0 in the Champions League on Wednesday to secure a place in the last 16 of Europe's elite club competition.
