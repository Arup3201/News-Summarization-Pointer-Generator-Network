A plan to force mobile phone giants to share masts to plug signal blackspots could put the fight against terrorism at risk, Theresa May has warned.

Barely 24 hours after being accused of being 'uncollegiate', it emegred that the Home Secretary is opposing Tory Culture Secretary Sajid Javid's attempts to eliminate poor signals that leave millions of us unable to make calls or use the internet.

He wants to force the four major networks – EE, Vodafone, O2 and Three – to act through a change in the law. 

Home Secretary Theresa May has come out against a plan by Culture Secretary Sajid Javid to force mobile companies to share masts to boost por signals

Mrs May has written to the Prime Minister and other senior ministers to warn that the proposals could have a 'detrimental impact on law enforcement'.

The letter, leaked to The Times, said the plans could interfere with the police's ability to listen to calls and read emails, which she said is ‘vital to protecting the public from crime and terrorism’.

The rift between Ms May and Mr Javid - both seen as potential future Tory leadership candidates - comes just months after a major row between the Home Secretary and Michael Gove, the then education secretary over radicalism in schools.

Yesterday Lib Dem minister Norman Baker quit the Home Office, claiming working with Mrs May was like 'walking through mud' and her management style 'did not make for good relations'. 

Mr Javid is considering a system of ‘national roaming’ that would allow phone users to hop between different networks.

It would mean a phone call is transferred to the nearest mobile phone mast, even if it is run by a rival company to the one the caller is signed up to. 

This is similar to what already happens when you use your phone abroad.

Another option is to force so-called ‘infrastructure sharing’, which would allow mobile networks to put transmitters on each other’s masts.

The Government is also to consider imposing a new legally binding coverage obligation, requiring networks to cover a certain percentage of the UK.

So-called ‘not spots’, where there is no signal at all, are mostly in remote, rural communities.

Partial not-spots, where one provider might provide a signal, but others do not, are much more widespread – affecting 20 per cent of the country in terms of geography.

Mr Javid will also suggest reforms to packages sold by companies such as Tesco and Virgin, who currently agree access to a single network and then sell mobiles to consumers.

The Government could ensure third-party firms are able to offer devices that can access all four networks.

However, the proposals in the consultation will trigger an angry backlash from mobile phone companies, who say they have funded the costs of erecting masts themselves and do not want to share them with rivals.

A new study by Open Signal shows that in some areas users have a 3G phone signal barely half of the time

Mr Javid said: ‘I see this as a national utility that we should all be able to use. It’s not just about lifestyle, it’s absolutely vital for a modern economy.

‘In the UK, at a national level, we don’t have roaming. So a French person coming to Wales gets a better signal that someone does as a local. It is such a big problem that something needs to be done.’ 

Under the plan, phone users would switch between the masts of different companies to ensure they keep a signal

Ms May's letter, sent to David Cameron and other Cabinet ministers, said two of the proposed options, including national roaming, ‘could have a detrimental impact on law enforcement, security and intelligence agency access to communications data and lawful intercept’.

She also raised objections to the option of allowing Tesco to sell phones that access all four networks, and called for further studies to make sure that the changes do not stop police from accessing ‘information that is crucial to keeping us safe’.

Ms May argues that their ability to listen to calls and read emails is ‘vital to protecting the public from crime and terrorism’.

The Home Secretary does not spell out the technical issues that could undermine interception of calls but it is thought that roaming would significantly complicate agencies’ ability to track suspects.

Last night a spokesman for the Home Office said they did not comment on 'leaked letters'.  

Meanwhile, the speeds of the new ‘super-fast’ 4G mobile phone services have slowed dramatically since they were launched two years ago, it has been revealed.

So many people have signed up, often at a premium price, that the system has become congested as users try to surf the web.

Despite mobile phone companies promising they would be five times faster, Britain’s 4G speed is less than three times faster than the current average for the 3G network, according to a report by consumer group Which? and industry experts at OpenSignal.

Mobile phone firms have been trying to increase the capacity of the 4G system by putting up thousands of masts.
