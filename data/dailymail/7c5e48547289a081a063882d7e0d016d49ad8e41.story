An Indian court on Saturday sentenced six men convicted of the gang rape of a Swiss woman to life in prison, in one of several recent cases that have fuelled a public outcry over the high rate of sex crimes in India.

The 39-year-old Swiss woman was raped while camping with her husband in a forest in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh in mid-March.

'It was a good judgment. It came early,' said Rajendra Tiwari, a lawyer for the government.

The attack, which took place in the state of Madhya Pradesh (pictured), involved six men attacking a Swiss woman

The woman had previously asked judges trying her six attackers not to impose the death penalty.

Judges in Daita, central India, 
opened the case with four of the six charged with rape and 
the other two facing assault and robbery charges.

The court heard that the 39-year-old 
victim and her husband had been on a cycling holiday in Madhya Pradesh 
state when their camp was attacked by the gang.

After beating and tying up her 30-year-old husband, the gang pinned down and raped his terrified wife, said prosecutors.

The National Crime Records Bureau says more than 24,200 rapes were reported across India in 2011 - about one every 20 minutes. Police estimate only four out of 10 rapes are reported, largely due to victims' fear of being shamed by their families and communities.

A new law has been passed following nationwide  protests sparked by the fatal gang rape of a young woman on a bus in New Delhi

The gang rape of a 23-year-old woman 
on a bus on December 16 in New Delhi sparked a global outcry over the 
issue and brought thousands of people onto the streets to demand better 
policing to prevent sex crimes. The trainee physiotherapist later died 
from her injuries.

It
 brought hundreds of thousands of angry citizens out in the streets to 
demand more safety for women and harsher laws to deter the perpetrators 
of such acts.

An American tourist was gang-raped by
 a group of men in a hill resort in northern India in June. In March, a 
British woman jumped out of her hotel balcony in Uttar Pradesh state to 
escape a feared sexual assault.

Outrage: The brutal attack at the end of last year sent shock waves across India

India has seen a sharp fall in the numbers of foreign tourists, especially women, since the high-profile rape and murder of a young woman in New Delhi in December.

In
 the three months since that attack, the number of foreigners travelling
 to India has dropped by 25 per cent, according to the the New 
Delhi-based Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

The number of women tourists has dropped by 35 per cent, the study released last night said.

The study 
surveyed 1,200 tour operators from across the country who said that 
'concerns about the safety of female travelers' had impacted how foreign
 travelers viewed India.

Since the December gang rape there 
have been two widely publicised incidents where foreign female 
travellers have been attacked.
