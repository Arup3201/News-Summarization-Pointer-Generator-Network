A struggling actor accused of trying to extort millions from moguls like Harvey Weinstein threatened to kill their relatives if they failed to comply with his demands, an indictment says.

Vivek Shah, 25, who has only had bit parts in various television shows, films and a commercial, was arrested in August, and charged with multiple counts of extortion in the case.

He allegedly sent letters - which are all actually titled 'Extortion Notice' - to the homes of Weinstein and other wealthy Americans between June 9 and August 9.

wasn't deposited

The indictment, obtained by TheSmokingGun.com, outlines the threat to those who ignore the letter.

'[Victim], if you follow the instructions, then you can take this notice lightly. If you don't, then expect at least one person dead in the next one year. It could either be [first names of close relatives], or any other close relative.'

It was the threatening letter sent to Florida coal tycoon Christopher Cline that started the police’s investigation.

Postal inspector Joshua Mehall testified in an affidavit that a $13million extortion letter was sent to the billionaire’s home.

Shah allegedly threatened to kill Cline's family members if the sum was not deposited in an off-shore bank account in Cyprus, Mr Mehall said.

Mr Cline, the owner of Foresight Reserves, is worth an estimated $1.5billion, according to Forbes magazine.

When federal agents looked into the 
threat made to Mr Cline, they discovered several other similar threats 
made to the wealthy elite.

Shah allegedly sought $4million from Weinstein, $34million from Buffalo Sabres owner Terry Pegula, $16million from Groupon co-founder Eric Lefkofsky and

But he demanded the most from oil heiress Dannine Avara - a whopping $35million.

Two others, who have not been publicly identified, are listed in the indictment by initials ‘G.G.’ and ‘R.K.’

'It was scary when he got that letter that involved his family,' a Weinstein spokesman told Deadline Hollywood's Nikki Fink when asked for the A-Lister's reaction. 'He was like, "What the heck is this?"'

Mr. Weinstein has four daughters and is married to designer Georgina Chapman.

The affidavit added that Shah, who also uses the aliases Ray Amin and Rohan Gill, was staying at his father’s home in Schaumburg, Illinois, where the letters were mailed from, just before his arrest.

The scheme laid out in the affidavit was ambitious and wide-reaching, involving offshore banks in Cyprus, Antigua, Malta and Mauritius.

On his IMDb page, Shah is pictured with a host of A-list celebrities, including Tom Cruise, Angelina Jolie, and Boardwalk Empire star Steve Buscemi.

His
IMDb biography says that he was born in Akron, Ohio, and had several 
brief and often un-credited roles in TV shows like Outsourced, Bones, 
and Animal Witness.

He also appeared briefly in 2008’s The Dark Knight 
as a bank hostage.

Shah 
also appeared in a 2010 Intel ad, where he and another man - Intel 
programmers - are arguing where to cut a cake shaped like an Intel 
processor.
