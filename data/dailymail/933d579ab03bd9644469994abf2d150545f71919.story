Three tourists who were caught having sex amid the ancient ruins of what was once Pompeii's very lively red light district have been charged with trespassing by Italian police.

A Frenchman and two Italian women, all aged 23 to 27, allegedly broke into the Suburban Baths to fulfil their fantasies inside a former brothel that is still decorated with centuries-old wall paintings depicting explicit sex scenes.

But authorities brought the group's middle-of-the-night threesome to a premature end, the Italian newspaper Il Mattino reported.

Suburban Baths similar to those in Pompeii are still intact in the ancient Roman city of Herculaneum

The trio allegedly climbed over a gate to access the erotic site, which was a hangout for wealthy businessmen and politicians before the Roman city was wiped out by a volcanic eruption in 79 AD.

Even though they have been charged by police, the trio have vowed to return to the Unesco World Heritage Site to carry out their desires. 

Researchers believe the erotic paintings depicting group sex and other naughty acts may have indicated the services offered by prostitutes.

Visit Pompeii tour guide Giuseppe Galano told The Local: ‘It’s ridiculous and vulgar, but young people are fascinated by this and sometimes try to play this game.

‘They don’t understand the cultural value of the frescoes at all.’
