Hundreds of railway staff will be paid £2,500 ‘bribes’ simply for  agreeing to work without disruption during the Olympics.

It also emerged yesterday that the total bill for the Games could hit £24billion – ten times the original estimate.

The rail deal means staff will earn £900 bonuses just for turning up for work. The 500 Docklands Light Railway workers will also be guaranteed five hours of overtime a week, for which they will be paid 75 per cent above their normal shift rate.

Driver-less... but staff on the Docklands Light Railway network - which will carry spectators to and from the Olympics - have been offered a 25 per cent increase in overtime

This means some staff could end up with an extra £2,500 by the end of the Olympics and Paralympics. It is the latest in a series of lucrative agreements struck by Bob Crow’s RMT union which have been described as ‘ransom payments’ to prevent chaos on public transport during the Games.

And it will antagonise taxpayers who learned yesterday that the cost of the Olympics has soared. When Britain won the bid to host the Games, in 2005, ministers said it would cost £2.37billion.

The Coalition has since budgeted £9.3billion to cover venues, policing and security.

'Bragging': Bob Crow, the RMT Union's General Secretary

But hundreds of ‘hidden’ costs mean the true bill could be between £2.4billion and £14billion more than this, according to a Sky News investigation. These costs include land purchases, anti-terrorism funding and transport improvements.

Bonuses to stop London Underground staff striking, converting venues for public use after the Games, employing anti-doping officers and investing in tourism also add to the cost.

The TaxPayers’ Alliance called on the Government to stop ‘merrily writing cheques’ and remember the millions of ordinary families ‘paying for this event’.

Last night, Greg Knight, Tory MP for East Yorkshire, said: ‘This is grotesque. Many people will have to work overtime during the Olympics but they do not get huge payments.

‘Just because the word “Olympics” has been mentioned does not been they should be handed more money.’

And Dominic Raab, Tory MP for Esher and Walton, said: ‘Yet again Bob Crow’s brinkmanship means taxpayers coughing up to pay rail staff bonuses just for doing their job.

Let the Games commence: The deal would cover a period of almost nine weeks during the Olympics and Paralympics

‘This deal shows how out of touch the militant unions are with the reality of the straitened times everyone else faces.’ But Mr Crow, the RMT’s general secretary, said: ‘This is a truly groundbreaking deal, raising the bar in the industry and putting £2,500 in our members’ pockets as a reward for the extra workload and pressure they will carry.’

Serco Docklands, which operates the DLR trains on behalf of Transport for London, said that the deal was ‘fair’ and reflected the extra hours that staff would be asked to work and ‘restrictions to their annual leave’ during that time.

The DLR has no drivers, but on-board ‘captains’ responsible for passenger safety are paid an average of £36,000. They are usually paid 50 per cent extra on their normal shift rate for overtime, but this will rise to 75 per cent during the Games.

Last night it was unclear which public body would pay. TfL said it would bill the Olympic Delivery Authority for the overtime, but an ODA spokesman said it would only ‘reimburse TfL for normal overtime payments’ incurred during the Olympics and not bonus payments.

Tube drivers will be paid up to £1,200 extra for working changed and longer duties during the Olympics. They are also in talks with TfL over a separate bonus.  Train drivers working for London Overground are getting a £500 bonus.

A spokesman for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport denied that the overall cost of the Games would hit £24billion.

‘The Public Sector Funding Package for the Games is £9.3billion and includes all additional security, defence and public transport provision,’ the spokesman said. ‘It is simply not right to start adding budgets that would have been in existence regardless of 2012 and claim that as being an Olympic cost.’
