NBA great Bob Cousy has opened up about his beloved wife Missie's heart-breaking dementia and how he went to enormous lengths to allow the woman he called 'my bride' to believe she was healthy until the end.

Cousy, 85, who led the Celtics to six World Championships, said he never felt defeated by the challenge of caring for his high school sweetheart without seeking help, services or sympathy as she slowly succumbed to the ravaging disease.

And a week after her death, though bereft and inconsolable, he has described his bounding love for the woman who bristled at the suggestion she was suffering dementia, and the tear-jerking 'game plan' he followed - from shipping her car to their vacation home and doing all the household chores - that allowed her to believe, in her own mind, she wasn't sick.

Great love: NBA great Bob Cousy, pictured in 2006, has opened up about his beloved wife Missie's heart-breaking dementia and the enormous lengths he went to to allow the woman he called 'my bride' to believe she was healthy until the end

'My dad provided an environment that allowed her, in her mind, to be a fully functioning adult,' the couple's daughter Marie told The Worchester Telegram & Gazette as she sat by her father's side on Thursday. 'It was amazing to watch.'

Cousy married the raven-haired Marie Ritterbusch 63 years ago - six months after he graduated from the College of the Holy Cross having helped his team win an NCAA championship.

He spent his wedding night playing point guard for the Celtics, which set the scene for how the early part of their marriage would unfold.

'I was busy playing a child's game,' Cousy said. 'I thought putting a ball in a hole was important. Looking back, I should have participated more in the lives of my family. But my girls were in the best possible loving hands.'

However, tearing up, he described how the couple's romance flourished as they grew older.

'Our marriage was somewhat contrary 
to tradition,' he said. 'Most couples have the most intensity in the 
beginning. But I was always working. So we had the best and most 
romantic part of our marriage at the end. We literally held hands for 
the last 20 years.'

Missie began her cognitive decline a dozen years ago, Cousy told the newspaper. She would ask him the same questions repeatedly and grew disoriented, struggling with balance.

But she always knew her husband, and the fiercely independent woman, who was used to running a household with her husband gone for weeks at a time, refused to believe she was suffering from dementia.

So, used to 'game plans,' Cousy worked hard to create the perception that his bride was still her old self.

He had her station wagon shipped to their place in Florida in the winter because she thought she could still drive. He planted artificial flowers in the garden and did all the chores, telling her she'd done them herself.

When her condition worsened, the couple stopped socializing and apart from the occasional 'night out with the boys' or game of golf, he spent all his time alone with his sweetheart, patiently answering her questions and ensuring she had everything she needed.

'It drew us closer together,' he told
the newspaper. 'It was never a chore, because I knew she would have 
done the same for me. You just have to go with the flow. Every three 
months, I'd scream out something just for release.'

Sports lover: Cousy, pictured left in 2007, and right in 1950, was always a sports love and spent weeks away from his family while playing

Each morning, Cousy would wake first and arrange Missie's pills, the newspaper, a fiber bar and a banana on the kitchen table before rousing her.

She would take two or three hours to get through the paper, he said, because she liked to underline every line with a black pen. He explained how, after a while, he found comfort in reading between the lines because it was something they shared.

'She was leading a happy life,' he said. 'It was part of the game plan.'

The routine continued for years.

But on September 7, when Cousy took his wife for an early dinner at Worcester Country Club and on the drive home she suffered a severe stroke. She died peacefully two weeks later.

Now, he no longer puts her pills out in the morning or reads between the lines. But, as he did for decades before, he still tells his wife he loves her before bed each night.

It's hard to entirely give up the game plan.
