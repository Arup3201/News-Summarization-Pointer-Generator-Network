A deckchair manufacturer is having to make its seats wider - because of increasing levels of obesity in Britain.

Southsea Deckchairs, based in Portsmouth, Hampshire, has been forced to add an inch to its standard model, taking it to 23ins wide.

Orders of the company's £128 'Wideboy' chair - originally built for two people and measuring 36ins long - have shot up recently, with overweight people increasingly buying them for individual use.

But now the
 firm, Britain's last remaining deckchair maker, is making its 
regular-sized seats wider 'to accommodate larger customers.' 

Company
 boss Stephen Davies told The Sun: 'We sell several hundred wideboys a 
year - they're very popular. We recently had a big lad come in and use 
one as a standard chair.

'He'd never fit into a normal one.'

Around
 65 per cent of people in England are now overweight or obese - and the 
NHS already spends an estimated £5.1billion a year treating 
obesity-related illnesses.

Last week it was revealed that the NHS has been forced to spend £1m on super-sized CT scanners to deal with the escalating obesity crisis.

The new machines can penetrate five times the amount of fat - and the weight they can take has nearly doubled from 25st (160kg) to 47st (300kg).
