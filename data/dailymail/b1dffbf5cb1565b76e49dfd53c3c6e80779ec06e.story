As a relaxed Environment Agency chairman Lord Smith left his £1.5million London home for work on Friday amid more storm chaos, he could be comforted by the knowledge that his weekend retreat in a remote Highlands hamlet has its own flood defences.

What’s more, the village was named yesterday as one of the driest places in the UK.

Lord Smith is a frequent visitor to the four-bedroom property in the village of Alligin, which has seen 50 per cent less rain than its normal seasonal average.

And should the Highland weather take a turn for the worse, Lord Smith’s home is protected from the waters of the nearby loch by its own flood defence scheme – a sturdy stone wall built specifically for that purpose.

Lord Smith would not comment on his Scottish retreat last night.

Elsewhere, areas of southern England, including Henley-on-Thames (pictured), are experiencing heavy flooding
