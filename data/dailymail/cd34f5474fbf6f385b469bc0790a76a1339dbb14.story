In this age of instant news perhaps the only two groups of people who still wait eagerly for the postman to arrive are star-crossed lovers on Valentine’s Day and professional golfers eagerly awaiting their official invitation to the Masters.

For rising Englishman Danny Willett, the joyous confirmation of the latter came recently while halfway through a gym session at home. ‘I saw the postman coming down the yard, so I stopped the gym session and ran to the door because I had an inkling it was going to be the day,’ said the 27-year-old from Sheffield.

‘Obviously I knew I’d made it to Augusta by what I’d done at the end of last year but there’s still nothing like holding the official invitation. It just feels awesome to be setting out on a new season knowing you can plan your early year schedule around a trip to Augusta.’

Willett booked his place with a victory in the prestigious Nedbank Challenge in South Africa in December that in turn got him into the all-important world top 50. He was the underdog going into the final round against a former world No 1 in Luke Donald but underlined his potential by outplaying his countryman with a nerveless display.

Now, the hope is that after a few frustrating years when he has clearly been held back by a nagging back injury, he can lead the next wave of talented English golfers to the upper echelons of the game.

‘That’s certainly the goal,’ said Willett. ‘I’ve obviously gained a lot of confidence from what happened at the Nedbank. To play pretty flawless golf for the last 36 holes on a tight course was very satisfying.

‘We seem to have a good new wave of English golfers and it’s funny how it seems to happen in cycles. You’ve got the likes of Luke and Westy (Lee Westwood), Justin Rose and Ian Poulter, who were all about the same age and now you’ve got the likes of myself and Tommy (Fleetwood), Sully [Andy Sullivan] and a few others. So hopefully I can be the leader. We’re all aiming high and let’s hope we can go on to match the last wave.’

Willett’s father is a Church of England vicar and he could be forgiven for being rather sick of the fact that every piece about him points out that he is the son of a preacher man.

‘No, I’m not fed up of it. He’s retiring in a couple of years anyway so you’ll all have to stop it then,’ said Willett, with a grin.

Willett has been in fine form recently and has earned a place at the first Major of the season, the Masters 

Rather than his dad, it was his two older brothers, who were both sports-mad, who got Willett into golf. ‘I had to find some sport that I could beat them in,’ he said. ‘It’s funny when golf gets its hooks into you. I would practice for hours on my own. It takes over your childhood.’

Willett goes into the Dubai Desert Classic this week as leader of the Race to Dubai, and hoping his status will get him invitations to regular PGA Tour events ahead of the Masters.

‘It might mean a last-minute dash to tournaments but that’s not a bad problem to have,’ he said. ‘Sheffield or Los Angeles in February. . . that’s a toughie, isn’t it?’

In Dubai last year, Willett fulfilled a long-held dream to do a bit of sky-diving. Now, having recently got married and with a prized Masters invitation on the mantelpiece, he is looking up.
