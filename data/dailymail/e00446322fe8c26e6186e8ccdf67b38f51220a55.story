Televangelist Pat Robertson has been dishing out his own unique brand of marriage guidance advice again, this time telling the wife of a cheating husband to get over her man’s infidelity and start doing more to ensure he doesn’t have reason to wander.

‘Stop talking about the cheating!’ he told the woman during Wednesday's episode of his daily television program, ‘The 700 Club.’

The infamous evangelist was responding to a letter he had received from a woman called Ivy, who had admitted to struggling with forgiveness.

Pat Robertson has been dishing out his own unique brand of marriage guidance advice again, this time telling the wife of a cheating husband to get over her man's infidelity

‘We have gone to counseling, but I just can't seem to forgive, nor can I trust. How do you let go of the anger? How do you trust again?’ she wrote.

Robertson, known for his forthright views on a wide range of topics including homosexuality and politics, didn’t beat around the bush with his answer.

‘Here's the secret,’ he said. ‘Stop talking the cheating. He cheated on you, well, he's a man.’

Instead of focusing on the misdemeanor, Robertson told the woman to remind herself why she married her spouse and then fall in love with him all over again.

‘Does he provide a home for you to live in,’ he said. 'Does he provide food for you to eat? Does he provide clothes for you to wear? Is he nice to the children... Is he handsome?’

On a roll, Robertson offered further anecdotal advice on the ‘tendency of man.’

Robertson also told the viewer that it wasn't really her husband's fault he had cheated because modern society is filled with so much temptation

‘Recognize also, like it or not, males have a tendency to wander a little bit,’ Robertson said. ‘What you want to do is make a home so wonderful that he doesn't want to wander.’

Robertson also reminded the woman that it wasn’t really the man’s fault he had cheated because modern society is filled with so much temptation such as the internet ‘filled with pornography’ and magazine full of ‘salacious’ pictures.

‘Thank God that you have a marriage that is together and that you live in America and good things are happening,’ said Robertson.

This isn’t the televangelist's first foray into marital counseling, earlier this year he told woman that if their husband isn't paying attention, it's probably because you don't look 'pretty' and 'alert'.

'A woman came to a preacher I know - it’s so funny,' said Robertson on his show in January.

'She was awful-looking. Her hair was all torn up, she was overweight and looked terrible, clothes bad and everything, and she said, "Oh Reverend, what can I do? My husband has started to drink."

Since establishing the Christian Broadcasting Network in 1960, Pat Robertson has been no stranger to controversy.

'And the preacher looked at her and he said: "Madam, if I were married to you, I'd start to drink too."'

Robertson chuckled and added, 'We need to cultivate romance, darling.'

'You always have to keep that spark of love alive,' he said. 'It isn't something to just lie there [and think] "Well I'm married to him, so he's got to take me slatternly-looking." You have got to fix yourself up, look pretty, look alert.'

But unkempt women aren't solely responsible for failed marriages, Robertson reasoned.

That presumption would completely overlook another chief antagonist to an otherwise perfect union: Stubborn women.

Stubborn women can also kill a romance in a heartbeat, according to Robertson.

Offering his advice to a 17-year-old 
whose parents were having marital problems, Robertson suggested that the
 boy's mother was at fault.

If
 your husband isn't paying attention to you, it's probably because you 
don't look 'pretty' and 'alert,' Robertson told viewers in January

Writing
 to the mens' magazine Maxim, the teenager wrote: 'I’m 17 years old and 
I’ve noticed that there has been a change in my father’s behavior. He 
spends too much time at the computer playing a war game. I’ve noticed 
how alone my mom feels. I just want my father to spend more time with my
 mom. What should I do? How can I talk to my father? I feel shame for 
him. Please help.'

Robertson encouraged the boy to send his parents on a romantic getaway.

'The
 romance is obviously going out of the marriage,' he said. 'It's not as 
much excitement as it used to be and you know, it may be your mom isn’t 
as sweet as you think she is.'

'She may be kind of hard-nosed,' he 
continued. 'And so, you say, it’s my father, he’s not paying attention 
to mom, but is mom...' Robertson trailed off and started chuckling.

His female co-host interjected, 'How are you going to blame the mother?'

Robertson shot back: 'It's easy to blame the mother!'

The co-host laughed uncomfortably.

'It comes with 58 years of marriage I know what I'm talking about, okay?' Robertson snapped. 'Now what's next?'
