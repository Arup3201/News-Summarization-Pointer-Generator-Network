Hull City hope to take a step closer to signing Tom Ince.

The 22-year-old has agreed a contract with Hull and is poised to sign. The fee will be determined by a tribunal and former club Blackpool will ask for £8m based on the fact that Crystal Palace paid £1.5m for a five month loan from January.

On the move: Tom Ince has agreed a contract with Hull City but Stoke City retain an interest

International honours: Ince represented the England U21s earlier this summer

Ince turned down the chance to move to Inter Milan and was talking to clubs in England with Stoke City also keen.

Bruce has already been active in the transfer market this summer after making Jake Livermore a permanent signing from Spurs following an impressive loan spell at the KC Stadium last season.

Hull are also close to completing a £7million move for Norwich midfielder Robert Snodgrass.
