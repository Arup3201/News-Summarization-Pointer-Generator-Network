Divers resumed their search for missing 8-year-old girl Relisha Rudd on Saturday.

D.C. Spokesman Hugh Carew said divers were searching the Anacostia River in Kenilworth Park and Aquatic Gardens in Northeast D.C., the Washington Post reports. A foot search is expected to occur on Monday.

Rudd was last seen on March 1 with Kahlil Malik Tatum, 51, a janitor from her homeless shelter who police believe may have abducted her, the paper reports. 

The next day, police say Tatum bought a box of 42-gallon trash bags and was seen in Kenilworth Park.

Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said on Thursday that the search for Rudd is now 'a recovery mission' and that 'We can't ignore the possibility [Tatum] may have killed her.'

On Friday, Lanier said the search for Rudd is very technical in nature, and that about 100 people searched for her for about 16 hours a day, MyFoxDC reports.

Lanier also said that authorities are investigating and following every tip that comes in regarding Rudd's disappearance.

Lanier also said authorities are now 'positive' Tatum was in contact with other girls at the shelter where Rudd and her family live, the channel reports.

She said they are in contact with 'three to four' other families and they are concerned about the type of contact Tatum may have had with the other girls at the shelter.

Investigators say that Rudd's mother, grandmother and Tatum were in cahoots in an effort to mislead the administration of Payne Elementary School, where the girl had racked up 30 absences

An Amber Alert was issued for Relisha on March 20

MailOnline earlier reported that Shamika Young, Rudd's mother, asked Tatum to take care of her daughter on Februrary 26.

Rudd's multiple school absences caused authorities to look for her -- though her family had not filed a missing persons report.

Officials said Tatum posed as a doctor to get Rudd out of class by taking calls from her elementary school teacher and claiming that the girl was sick.

Tatum's wife Andrea Tatum, 51, was found dead in a motel room the day after cops began to look for her.

Tatum is charged with shooting her in the head. One document reportedly says that Andrea Tatum's daughter told authorities her mother was having domestic issues with her husband and was considering leaving him.

Young initially did not report her daughter missing and told police officers she had spoken to her on the phone as recently as two weeks ago.

However, it has since been revealed that Young met with Tatum and asked him to return Relisha, but he refused.

When questioned by police, Shamika Young reportedly said that her daughter was traveling with ‘Dr Tatum’ to a medical conference in Atlanta, where the janitor is believed to have ties.
