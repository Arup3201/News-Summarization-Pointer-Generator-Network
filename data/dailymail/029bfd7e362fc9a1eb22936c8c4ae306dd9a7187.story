A Munford, Alabama, man who tried to hire members of the Ku Klux Klan to torture and murder his African-American neighbor was sentenced on Monday to six years in prison.

Allen Wayne 'Big Dad' Morgan, 30, pleaded guilty in October to charges of using interstate facilities in an attempt to commit a murder for hire.

Prosecutors said Morgan spoke with an FBI
 agent posing as a Ku Klux Klan member and offered to pay him if he 
killed his neighbor. Morgan falsely suspected the neighbor, Clifford 
Maurice Mosley, of having an affair with his wife.

Other reports claim that Morgan believed Mosley had raped his wife. Mosley is a convicted sex offender.

Morgan wanted the man to have 'his d**k cut off' and to 'die a slow, painful death,' according to an audiotape of him that included racial slurs that was played in the courtroom sentencing trial.

'I want this man hung from a tree like he is an animal. I want his d*** cut off, and I want him cut. You're a hunting man right?' Morgan told an undercover FBI agent posing as a KKK hit man, according to an AL.com report. 'I want him hung from a tree and gutted.'

In issuing the sentencing, U.S. District Judge Karon Bowdre described the case as a 'horrible soap opera.'

The judge reduced the sentence, citing Morgan's service in the military. His lawyers argued that Morgan suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder after he served in 175 combat missions in Iraq.
