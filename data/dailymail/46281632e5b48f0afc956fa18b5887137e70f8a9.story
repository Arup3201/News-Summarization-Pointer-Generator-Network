Shelling out for a smart TV doesn’t come cheap, with prices reaching into the tens of thousands.

But a Which? investigation has revealed that the money could be wasted as soon as the manufacturer releases its next range, and ditches support for its older models.

It found popular apps and services, such as Netflix and BBC iPlayer, can be removed on models that are only a year or two old - and often without notice.

An investigation by Which? magazine discovered customers can lose services when manufacturers release new smart TVs. Manufacturers pay licenses to host apps, and this means they don't always choose to cover app licenses for older products. This graphic reveals which apps are supported on LG and Panasonic sets

When a TV manufacturer updates its 
smart TV range, the whole operating system it runs on can potentially 
change to incorporate new features.

This means the people who make the apps may have to redesign and recode their services to make them compatible. 

Manufacturers
 have to pay the developers for licenses to host the apps and show the 
content and, as a result, may choose to only cover app licenses for 
their newer products, and not their older ones.

Keeping
 apps such as BBC iPlayer and Netflix available on smart TVs requires 
agreement between the manufacturers and the third-party app providers.

If they can't agree, or either party changes their technology or software, consumers can lose services.

The investigation began when Which? was contacted by Samsung and LG smart TV customers who bought their sets in 2010 and 2011 respectively.

They were outraged after losing access to LoveFilm, now called Amazon Prime Instant Video.

This also goes the other way - if a TV was sold before an app becomes available, it’s unlikely the developers will ever make it backward compatible, meaning it will never work on models released before the app launched.

In some cases, manufacturers refuse to guarantee the availability of apps on their smart TVs, acknowledging they may be removed without notice.

It’s not just about time and money, though. Apps have ‘optimum environments’ in which they work.

This means that a particular app, such as Netflix, may have been designed to work on a device with a minimum processing power and screen resolution.

In some cases, manufacturers refuse to guarantee the availability of apps on their smart TVs. According to the report 'manufacturers blame the app providers, the app providers blame the manufacturers, and the retailers blame everyone but themselves. Yet in the middle of this, consumers can lose out'

If an older TV doesn’t meet these requirements, customers will get a poorer experience and Netflix could develop a reputation for providing a sub-standard service.

According to the Which? investigation, ‘manufacturers blame the app providers, the app providers blame the manufacturers, and the retailers blame everyone but themselves.

‘Yet in the middle of this, consumers can lose out. Since the product itself hasn’t developed a physical fault, it’s a grey area for consumer rights.'

A new consumer rights bill is being debated in parliament that will, for the first time, provide consumers with specific rights about digital content.
