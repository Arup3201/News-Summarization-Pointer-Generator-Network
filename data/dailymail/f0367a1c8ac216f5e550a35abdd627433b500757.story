Commercial radio stations have accused BBC Radio 1 - whose breakfast show is presented by Nick Grimshaw (pictured) - and Radio 2 of becoming too mainstream and stealing advertising revenue

BBC Radio 1 and Radio 2 have become too mainstream, and are costing commercial broadcasters more than £50m a year in lost advertising revenue, MPs have been told.

Commercial rivals claim that the BBC’s most popular radio stations are neglecting their public service obligations in pursuit of high ratings and are harming smaller competitors by drawing away their listeners.

An alliance of commercial radio stations has now voiced its concern in a submission to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee.

Radiocentre, the industry body that represents commercial radio stations in the UK, has now told the committee that the BBC’s most popular radio stations have become too dominated by popular artists that listeners can hear on commercial radio.

They said: ‘The BBC’s radio services, particularly Radio 1 and Radio 2, should be more distinctive and take the opportunity to provide greater public value, rather than simply seek large audiences.

‘It is hard to avoid the conclusion that much of the BBC’s growth in listening share in recent years has come at the direct expense of the commercial sector.’

The hearing comes ahead of a parliamentary inquiry about the running of the BBC in the run-up to renewal of its royal charter in 2017.

Earlier this year, Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps warned the corporation’s £3.6bn annual licence fee funds could be cut unless the BBC tackles a  ‘culture’ of secrecy, waste and bias.

He said the Corporation must rebuild confidence following the Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall abuse scandals, controversy over fat cat salaries and pay-offs to stars and senior executives.

In October, it was revealed that Radio 2 continues to have the UK’s biggest audience with 14.94m listeners each week, up a million in a year. Radio 1 has 10.83m listeners.

Last month, Radio 2 were forced to scale back its planned coverage of Gary Barlow’s latest album after Radiocentre warned the extensive coverage risked breaching BBC guidelines which forbid the corporation from ‘unfairly promoting any commercial organisations’.

They claimed the BBC’s decision to give the artist so much free exposure to promote his album to listeners could end up depriving other stations of advertising revenue.

The commercial stations argue that the BBC should use its licence fee funding to promote new artists, make specialist programmes and cater for audiences that would not otherwise be properly served by the rest of the market.

Radio 1, for example, should focus on younger listeners but the average age of its audience is now 32, Radiocentre said.

A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘Research shows that not only is there strong public support for the BBC showing a wide range of content and funded by the licence fee, but also that in countries where public service broadcasting is strong, commercial broadcasting is also strong.’

In a separate submission, lobby group Voice of the Listener &Viewer defended the BBC, warning politicians not to allow the BBC’s commercial rivals to ‘set the tone of this debate without providing convincing evidence of the BBC’s detrimental effects on new services’.
