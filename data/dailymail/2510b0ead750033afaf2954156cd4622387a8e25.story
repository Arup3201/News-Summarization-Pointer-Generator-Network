A young mother endured a terrifying ordeal when she had a heart attack while eight months pregnant.

Antonia Croft, 23, says the shock of seeing her cat Digsby run into traffic brought on shortness of breath and chest pains.

She was taken by ambulance to hospital where doctors told her she had experienced a heart attack brought on by an undetected blood clot.

A woman is 10 times more likely to develop a blood clot during pregnancy, statistics show.

Ms Croft was warned a natural birth would put her at serious risk and was booked in for a Caesarean section, but she went into labour naturally just four days before her baby was due to be delivered.

Thankfully, her son Don’tae was born healthy and today both mother and baby are doing well, although she requires regular monitoring and medication which doctors hope will repair her damaged artery.

Miss Croft, who also has a daughter, Shamayah, five, said: ‘Digsby bolted from our front door as I was getting my daughter ready for school. He ran into the road and I screamed as a passing car slammed on its brakes.

‘Afterwards I felt extremely hot, and I couldn’t cool myself down no matter what I tried. I started to feel a pain in my chest.’

Initially putting her discomfort down to her late stage of pregnancy, Miss Croft, of Wavertree, Liverpool, was prescribed painkillers by her GP.

But after a sleepless night, she was practically immobile.

Miss Croft said: ‘It felt as if someone was sat on my chest. I could hardly breathe and felt pains in my arms and the centre of my back.’

An ambulance was called and Miss Croft, with her concerned boyfriend, postman Lee Foster, 26, beside her, was taken to the Royal Liverpool Hospital before she was transferred to Broadgreen Hospital, where she had to stay on a heart monitor for five days.

She said: ‘A scan showed a shadow on my heart. I couldn’t believe I’d had a heart attack. It didn’t seem real. I’d never had any symptoms previously.

‘I was absolutely terrified. My first thought was for my son. I’d found out the sex of the baby at a 20 week scan and couldn’t wait for him to arrive.

‘He was the first boy on my side of the family for 35 years and he meant everything to me.

‘I was distraught at the idea of leaving Shamayah without a mum.’

Miss Croft was told she would need to have a planned C-section for fear her heart wouldn't be able to cope with a natural birth. However, she went into labour before the operation and Don'tae was born naturally

Doctors informed her that her heart was too weak for a natural birth and arranged a Caesarean section three weeks before her due date.

They also prescribed steroid injections to aid in the development of her unborn son’s lungs, as they were concerned he had been distressed by his mother’s heart attack.

But as she lay resting at home on July 20, 2013, awaiting her planned Caesarean on July 24, Miss Croft felt the onset of labour.

She said: ‘I was extremely scared. I didn’t know how I would cope with giving birth naturally. I’d been quite panicky during Shamayah’s birth, so I had those memories at the top of my mind, and I prayed that I wouldn’t suffer another attack.’

Don’tae was delivered by midwives as a team of doctors and nurses observed his mother’s status on a heart monitor.

Fortunately Digsby was not injured when he ran into the road because the cars braked in time to avoid him

Miss Croft and Don'tae are now healthy but she is being carefully monitored

He was born underweight at 4lb 8oz but today Don’tae is a healthy, happy 10-month-old baby.

Miss Croft, now 23, said: ‘I was so relieved to hold him for the first time and Lee was very proud too.

‘Don’tae is growing up very nicely and is an absolute angel. I’ve had to be careful not to push things too much, but Shamayah has been a star by helping me with him.

‘The medical staff at the hospital now want to include my case in a medical journal, because there’s rarely been an example of someone so young experiencing such a serious heart attack and going on to have a problem-free natural labour.

‘It was shocking having a heart attack so young, particularly in the circumstances I was in. I’ve always been active. I walk everywhere and I’m careful about what I eat. I never expected to face anything like this.

‘It’s made me realise that anyone can have a heart attack, no matter their age or their circumstances. Life can change in an instant.’
