Family affair continues, but without Joseph Marcell, who played butler Geoffrey

Janet Hubert and Daphne Reid, who played matriarch Aunt Vivian, are absent too

It is enough to make people want to dig into the closet for their old shell suits.

Will Smith has posed for a picture of his old cast-mates from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air, the wildly popular sitcom that launched his acting career.

The show, which aired from 1990 until 1996, was staple for a generation of teenagers in the US and abroad.

Family guy: Will Smith looked delighted to be spending time with his old Fresh Prince chums, from left Tatyana Ali (who played Ashley Banks), Karyn Parsons (Hilary), Alfonso Ribeiro (Carlton) and James Avery (Philip)

And Will, 43,Â  said he was delighted to be able to see his second family in the run up to Christmas at a special charity event last week, before he shaved his head.

He said: 'Got the Holiday season started right with a Fresh Prince of Bel Air reunion.

'There's nothin' like spending Holidays with fam!'

The picture was taken last week at a luncheon for the charity Sweet Blackberry, which was founded Karyn Parsons, who played airhead weather girl Hilary on the show.

The other cast members there were Tatyana Ali, who played his little cousin Ashley, Alfonso Ribeiro who played his snobby cousin Carlton and James Avery, who was the Banks family patriarch Uncle Phil.

Sadly missing was Joseph Marcell, who played the Banks' butler Geoffrey, and the two actresses who filled the role of matriarch Aunt Vivian.

Will posted the exciting photograph on his Facebook page earlier today, and it proved extremely popular.

As they were: Will as he appeared in the early 90s show's first season, with the show's butler Geoffrey and his aunt Vivian also appearing in this pic

It has already attracted almost 50,000 likes from fans on the social networking website.

Of course there are a few more grey hairs and wrinkles on display than during their 90s heyday.

On the whole however, everyone was looking remarkably well preserved,

The Fresh Prince of Bel Air followed the adventures of a fictionalised version of Will himself.

After getting into trouble with a local gang his mother decides to send him to stay with her wealthy and successful sister in the posh Bel Air area of Los Angeles.

It was notable for Will's often eccentric choices of early 90s clothing, with the rapper displaying a particular fondness for dayglo pinks.

Amazingly the future movie superstar only agreed to appear in the show as he was in massive debt problems with the IRS, owing $2.8 million after overspending on the income he earned from his then successful career as a rapper.

It became a launch pad for his hugely successful acting career, which has saw him star in box office hits such as Independence Day, Men In Black and Ali.
