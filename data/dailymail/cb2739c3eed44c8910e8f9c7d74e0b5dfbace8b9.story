If you were disappointed that Father Christmas brought sunshine instead of snow for Christmas Day, you may not have to wait too long.

Forecasters predict temperatures are set to plummet today – and there is even a risk of storms.

The Met Office has issued a cold weather alert for large parts of England and severe weather warnings for snow from this afternoon.

It is due to a so-called weather 'bomb' – or rapid cyclogenesis as it is known in technical terms – which will see snow and gale force winds bring misery to vast swathes of Britain.

But if you're travelling to visit relatives you could avoid the worst of the Boxing Day battering by getting out on the road early, as much of the country will not suffer the rain and gales of the 'bomb' until this afternoon.

Yesterday felt like a mild spring day in many parts of the country – daffodils were spotted shooting up in Stoke Park in Guildford as families enjoyed a pre-lunch walk in the sunshine. 

And swimmers taking part in the annual Peter Pan Cup race in the Serpentine in central London were able to enjoy slightly less icy water than usual.

Bookmakers are offering odds of 5/4 that it will snow today. Forecasters are not sure which regions in the UK will experience snow, but high ground is set to see three or four inches. There will also be gusty 40mph winds bringing rain and sleet.

The unsettled weather threatens to disrupt one of the busiest shopping days of the year.

Millions are expected to hit the roads to visit relatives and friends or hit the sales but they have been warned to keep up to date with forecasts.

There has been localised flooding in some parts of the UK and the Environment Agency has nine flood alerts in place – three in the north east, four in the north west and one each in the south east and south west.

Residents in Windermere had an early taste of what is to come after they awoke yesterday to find Lake Windermere had broken its banks after days of rainfall, submerging large parts of the locality. 

There was also snow in Scotland before Christmas. The Met Office said: 'An area of rain, sleet and snow is expected to spread eastwards across parts of Northern Ireland, England and Wales during Boxing Day before clearing during overnight.

'A lot of uncertainty surrounds how much snow will occur, but there is the risk of several centimetres even at low levels. As precipitation clears, roads could turn very icy. The public should be aware of the potential for disruption from snow. Please watch for updates to this warning, especially if travelling.'

Krista Mitchell, a meteorologist, said: 'This year as a whole has been very mild, so this could be the coldest spell that we've had. As we go towards Monday and Tuesday, we will see overnight temperatures really drop, with widespread frost and most places dropping below freezing.'

Ladbrokes said it was 'breathing a multi-million-pound sigh of relief' at the lack of snow yesterday. Spokesman Jessica Bridge said: 'White Christmas punters piled into the odds but the odds suggest the mild temperatures have saved the industry from a bumper payout by just 24 hours.'

Forecasters say conditions should become more settled as the weekend wears on but temperatures are set to plunge to -6C on Sunday night. Night time conditions are set to stay well below freezing next week.
