Warned: Prime Minister David Cameron has been told sending arms to Syrian rebels could see them end up in the hands of Islamist terrorists who target the West

David Cameron has been warned against sending arms to Syrian rebels amid fears they would end up in the hands of Islamist terrorists who target the West.

Up to 3,000 surface-to-air missiles have gone missing in Libya since the conflict -  and spy chiefs say the state has become the 'Tesco' of the world's illegal arms trade.

More than one million tonnes of weapons belonging to Colonel Gaddafi were looted from arms dumps after the dictator was toppled in October 2011.

MI6 agents fear large numbers of 
weapons - which included 22,000 shoulder-launched missiles capable of 
bringing down an aircraft - have been smuggled out of Libya to groups 
linked to Al Qaeda.

Security
 sources are said to fear that, if the rebels fighting tyrant Bashar 
al-Assad's regime in Syria are armed by the West, a similar situation 
could arise there - with the weapons falling into the hands of Islamic 
extremists in the country.

It
 is understood MI6 estimates there are now more weapons in Libya than 
the entire arsenal of the British Army — and much of it is unsecured.

The Libyan government remains in a precarious position, with large parts of the army dominated by local militias.

There
 were thought to be 22,000 shoulder-launched anti-aircraft missiles, 
known as manpads, at the time of Gaddafi's death in October 2011. And although the majority are believed to have been destroyed MI6 estimates about 3,000 are still unaccounted for.

Just one such missile could bring down a civilian airliner if it fell into the wrong hands. As well as the security services, several military figures have deep reservations about any plans to arm the rebels in Syria.

General Sir Richard Dannatt, the former head of the army, yesterday said he was 'very much in the camp of those who would not wish to be involved and intervene in any shape or form.'

Major General Julian Thompson, who commanded British forces in the Falklands War in 1982, said it was 'absolutely ridiculous' to contemplate another intervention at a time when troop numbers were being cut.

Ministers will confirm tomorrow another 5,000 Army personnel will lose their jobs.

'People will think it is absolutely ridiculous,' said Maj Gen Thompson. 'The thought of getting involved with something else before we finish what we are trying to do in Afghanistan would certainly not be good for morale.'

Mr Cameron is in a precarious position because he is keen to support US President Barack Obama.

America plans to channel small arms to the rebels but has no immediate intention of seeking international agreement to impose a no-fly zone.

But the dangers of this became starker yesterday SUN when an internet video showed a stockpile of surface-to-air missiles had fallen into the hands of jihadists fighting in Syria.

The film shows a stash of at least 30 Soviet-era SA-16 heat-seeking missiles - the most advanced anti-aircraft weapons yet seen with in the clutches of the Islamists.

Known as the 'Needle', SA-16 missiles can hit aircraft flying at 11,000ft. They would be particularly dangerous if used for attacks from airport perimeters.

Military experts are concerned that arms supplied to Syrian rebels would find their way to fanatics who would then use them to target Britain.

Charles Lister, an analyst at IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Centre, said: 'If the West ever did provide weapons to the moderate insurgency, there is still a high chance weapons will cross between different groups and almost invariably end up in the hands of groups like this.'

Meanwhile, Mr Cameron has been warned that Britain would suffer 'unacceptable' casualties in a war with Syria.

Sources said the RAF risked losing up to 50 per cent of fighter jets deployed to enforce a no-fly zone because of Syria's extensive air defence system, which is based around infra-red guided missiles.

One well-placed insider said: 'It has been stressed to the Prime Minister that attacking Syria would not be the same as attacking Libya.'
