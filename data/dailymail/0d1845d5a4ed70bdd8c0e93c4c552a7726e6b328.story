When a beautiful protected pine tree was chopped down in the dead of night, investigators were baffled.

Until a council officer followed a trail of clues...that led straight to a neighbour’s hot tub.

Andrew Dearing, who was called in to investigate the destruction of the 40ft maritime pine, started his inquiry standing at the stump of the tree.

Accused: Neil Davey, left, allegedly 'paid or otherwise instructed' his friend and tree surgeon Thomas McGuire, right, to cut down his neighbour's tree. Council investigators say it blocked Davey's sea views from his hot tub

Felled: Neighbour Steve Bransgrove told the court he was woken by the revving of a chainsaw during the night. When he looked out his window the huge tree was on top of a wall.

Following a trail of flattened grass, he
came to the home of neighbour Neil Davey where an outdoor hot tub and 
sun terrace now, in the absence of the tree, had a gloriously 
uninterrupted view of Poole Harbour.

‘I saw the sun lounger and hot tub and saw where the tree had stood,’ Mr Dearing told Bournemouth Crown Court.

'I realised the owners had perfect views which were obstructed by the tree in question'

Poole Council officer Andrew Dearing

‘I thought, “Here’s a family who clearly enjoys sitting on their patio looking at the extensive views”.

‘I realised the owners had perfect views which were obstructed by the tree in question.’

Businessman and hot tub owner Neil Davey, 51, is accused of arranging 
for the pine, which had stood in the garden on the Dorset coast for 55 
years and was protected by a preservation order, to be chopped down to 
improve his sea view.

Tree surgeon Thomas McGuire, 34, is charged with carrying out the deed.

Investigation: Poole council launched a probe after the 55-year-old tree was cut down during the night

Mapped: A council investigator said Neil Davey's sea views from his new hot tub and sun terrace were being blocked by the tree

Neighbour Stephen Bransgrove, 53, told the court how he was woken by the
sound of a chainsaw the night his tree came crashing down in June 2010.

‘It sounded like a two-stroke engine, it was a loud revving noise,’ he 
said. ‘It wasn’t there for very long before all of a sudden a bang came 
and that was it.

‘It was the sort of noise as if something had hit the house, it was a loud bang.’ 

He told the jury that he went to a window overlooking the garden and saw
his tree on top of a wall. He rang the police and Poole council were 
called in to investigate.

Mr Dearing, a planning enforcement officer at the council, told the 
court that once the tree on Mr Bransgrove’s property was out of the 
way,  his neighbour Davey had perfectly uninterrupted views of Poole 
Harbour, the Isle of Purbeck, and Corfe Castle.

He refuted a suggestion he had been presumptious in claiming Mr Davey 
had ordered the tree to be chopped, saying: ‘I was thinking “Who would 
actually gain?”

‘The beneficiaries of the tree’s destruction would be Mr Davey and Mr Davey’s family.’

Davey, who owns an auctioneers based in Poole, was on honeymoon with 
wife Sheena in France on the night the tree was chopped down.

But the council claims he arranged for McGuire, who had been working at 
his £550,000 home, to remove the pine tree in his absence.

Matthew Tomlinson, prosecuting for Poole council, said a tree 
preservation order had been in place on the pine since 1990.  ‘Mr Davey 
lives in a neighbouring property to where the tree was cut down,’ he 
told the court.

‘It is the prosecution’s case that Mr Davey paid Mr McGuire or otherwise instructed Mr McGuire to cut down the tree.’

He said the two men claimed to have known each other for only five months, but had actually been friends for ten years.

He said although McGuire claimed to be in a different county on the 
night the tree had been destroyed, signals from his mobile phone had 
been traced to Poole.

Improved: The stunning views of Poole Harbour after the protected tree was cut down

Andy Luddington, arborilogical officer at the council, told the jury the
pine had been a healthy tree that stood 40ft high and had a canopy 
spread of 23ft.

He said it would have taken no more than 20 seconds to fell with a chainsaw.

McGuire, from Bournemouth, denies a charge of wilful destruction of a tree.

Davey, from Poole, denies causing or permitting the destruction of a tree.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
