X Factor may be a singing competition but whether they like it or not, the contestants are also judged on what they're wearing.

But they don't just throw on any old thing before they take to the stage; their whole look is carefully constructed with the help of a team of experts who work like a well oiled machine backstage.

Heading up the style squad is Gemma Sheppard, who has worked with the likes of Dannii Minogue, and helps curate each and every look for the live shows.

FEMAIL were keen to find out the entire dressing process, who her favourite judge is and how she copes with Simon Cowell's criticism so we grilled the stylist on all things X Factor.

Criticism: Lola Saunders' outfit came under fire this week after Simon Cowell said she looked like she was 'wrapped up in tape' - so how does her stylist feel about that? FEMAIL grilled her on all things X Factor 

On Saturday night's episode, Simon ticked off Cheryl Fernandez-Versini with his critique of her wildcard Lola Saunders, who took to the stage and performed Sam Smith's Stay With Me.

'I really don’t like what you’re wearing,' he frankly said afterwards.

'I'm gob-smacked. You just look like you're wrapped up in tape. It’s important that you dress how you want to and not how somebody else tells you to in order to become the artist you want to be.' 

Style statement: Gemma Sheppard, the show's lead stylist, hit back at Simon saying that Lola looked 'spectacular' for her performance.

So how does Gemma handle Simon's comments? 'The creative brief for Lola was a dramatic production to support her big song,' she told MailOnline.

'For her styling it was a case of fashion meets costume, the red dupioni silk gown with that 12ft train looked spectacular as she moved to centre stage, that was the money shot! I believe that statement dress empowered Lola for her performance.

'Criticism is part of the show, this is a contest, and I'm willing to take on board all the comments.

'Fashion is hugely subjective and you can't please everyone.' 

Muse: Gemma loves working with Chloe Jasmine and describes her as 'enchanting like a modern day Marilyn Monroe with her platinum hair and ‎rouge lips'

Style guru: Gemma has worked with Dannii Minogue in the past and is honoured to be styling this year's X Factor contestants 

Gemma believes that fashion is an 'emotional tool' and if you look good, you feel good. 

'It's all about confidence and getting inside of the contestant's heads,' she said. 'It is their closest moment to becoming a pop star so I want that to be translated in what they're wearing.'

She couldn't be happier with the group, who make her job all the more enjoyable.

'The contestants really are an amazing group, all very polite and from the beginning we have set a mutual understanding and respect.'

Despite public opinion, she doesn't believe that Chloe Jasmine is a diva, instead explaining: 'It's absolutely true what the judges say about Chloe, she is enchanting and lofts about the studios like a modern day Marilyn Monroe with her platinum hair and ‎rouge lips. 

'She is like my muse. On Saturday night she dazzled in a Quiz dress I customised for her. Inspired by the drawings Robert Cavalli did for Katy Perry, we cut the neck line into a deeper V, added mesh with beadwork and two petticoat layers to create the flapper vibe ‎she pulls off so well.'

As well as the contestants, Gemma works closely with the judges to discuss how they think their acts should dress for the live shows and she hugely admires both Cheryl and Mel's style.

She said: 'The girls are gorgeous, they ooze glamour and go for the less is more look with block colours and clean lines. 

'Mel's make-up is exquisite but I simply couldn't choose between the two as they're both equally distinctive and stunning.'
