Andreas Robbins, 25, left a suicide note saying he was going to jump off the George Washington Bridge - and hasn't been seen since

A father was left speechless after police told him they are 'too busy' dealing with Eric Garner protests to search for his suicidal son.

Andreas Robbins, 25, from Stuyvesant, New York, left a suicide note saying he was going to jump off the George Washington Bridge on Monday night - and hasn't been seen since.

His father Columbia University Professor Bruce Robbins said the NYPD was initially helpful, but now officers are busy dealing with thousands of protesters disrupting traffic and staging 'die-ins'.

'I was kind of speechless,' said Mr Robbins. 'A detective basically said, 'There's no one out to take your case because everyone is out there dealing with the consequences of the Eric Garner case'.'

The protests kicked off on Wednesday, after a grand jury decided not to press charges against a white police officer for his role in Eric Garner's death last July.

Daniel Pantaleo, 29, was filmed placing the 43-year-old father in a chokehold in the street and ignoring his cries that he could not breathe. Garner later died in hospital.

Police have arrested more than 80 people involved in the demonstration which saw protesters carrying coffins across the Brooklyn Bridge.

But officers say they have been 'working diligently' to find Mr Robbins as they sent out harbour and aviation units as well as canvassing around his neighbourhood.

The 25-year-old was caught on surveillance footage leaving his apartment at 7.45pm on Monday, without his phone or bank card.

His father learned about the suicide note on Monday evening after the 25-year-old's  girlfriend notified the police.

'The note said that he wanted his savings to be given to an organisation that fights depression and fight suicide and that he wanted his ashes strewn in the Mediterranean, which is where his mother is from,' said Mr Robbins.

He  rushed out to the George Washington Bridge on Monday evening but failed to find his son there.

Mr Robbins is described as 6ft 1inch tall and thin, weighing 200 pounds, with brown eyes and black hair

'We just want a sign that he is okay,' Mr Robbins said. 'He should do whatever he wants, go wherever he wants, whatever he needs to do, but we just want to know that he's okay.' 

He is described as 6ft 1inch tall and thin, weighing 200 pounds, with brown eyes and black hair.

Mr Robbins also has a prominent birthmark on the right side of his nose and tattoos on both shoulders and his right wrist.

His family said he may be wearing a grey herringbone dresscoat and a scarf.

He is also said to be a generous person who, 'would stop for an hour and talk to a homeless person at 1 a.m. in the morning'.

Anyone with information is asked to call the NYPD’s Crime Stoppers Hotline at 800-577-TIPS or visit http://www.nypdcrimestoppers.com.
