A Slacks Creek family who lost 11 relatives - including eight children - in a devastating house fire three years ago are calling for the mandatory installation of a $49 smoke alarm in homes across Australia.

Jeremiah Lale lost his wife and five children, while Tau Taufa suffered the loss of his wife, three granddaughters and niece on August 24, 2011, at a Wagensveldt Street home - south of Brisbane.

Mr Taufa's daughter, Tracey, was also left behind after the tragic deaths.

The victims of the fire were Fusikalau Taufa, Neti-Teukisia Lale, Anamalia Taufu, Jerry Lale, Paul Lale, Ardelle Lee, Lafoa'i Lale, Selamafi Lale, Richard Lale, La'Haina Matauaina and Kahlani Matauaina.

The fire started on August 24, 2011 at the Wagensveldt Street home - south of Brisbane

 Family members tried to save their relatives from the devastating blaze

And now the trio want authorities to make the installation of photoelectric smoke alarms mandatory in homes instead of ionic ones - which are in place in 90 per cent of Australian households.

The Slacks Creek fire started at midnight while Mr Taufa was still awake on August 24, 2011.

He told Channel Nine's 60 Minutes he saw a 'mist of smoke' coming from his office.

'I called out to my two son-in-laws to come down and help me,' Mr Taufa said.

'I grabbed the house and tried to put the fire out.'

Mr Taufa's son-in-law, Jeremiah Lale, described the scene as 'very dark' and 'very hot' with smoke so thick he could not see into the house.

Mr Lale called out his wife's and children's names to see if they were inside but when there was no answer he jumped out the window, thinking they had made their escapes.

'I tried to come back to the house but the fire was everywhere,' he said.

Since his family's death, Mr Lale arrives at the cemetery where they are buried every morning at 6am to sit for several hours at their grave sites.

'At the cemetery I sitting there and cry and keep talking to them. I tell them: "I know you can hear me but I can't hear you",' he said.

Tracey Taufa lost her daughter, mother, sister, aunt, two nieces and five cousins that August night.

She has pleaded with authorities to make photo-electric smoke alarms a requirement in all homes.

'I want everybody to purchase photo-electric smoke alarms to be installed in every single home and to be made mandatory in Australia and hopefully the world,' Ms Taufa urged people through tears.

'It will save a lot of lives. I just to hope to God nobody goes through what we went through.'

Fire safety experts are calling for photoelectric smoke alarms to be made mandatory in households

Northern Territory Assistant Fire Commissioner Grant Hamon (left) and fire safety expert David Isaac (right) say photoelectric smoke alarms are more effective

But Australian Building Codes Board's Neil Savery believes there is not enough evidence to make the change

And fire safety expert David Isaac agrees and has been pushing the cause for nearly a decade. 

In a fire demonstration on 60 Minutes where a soldering iron is used to simulate a still-burning cigarette setting a couch alight, it takes seven minutes for a photoelectric smoke alarm to detect the smoke.

But this is not the case with a ionic one.

Even after reporter Karl Stefanovic and Northern Territory Assistant Fire Commissioner Grant Hamon - who was running the demonstration - were evacuated after 15 minutes when fumes became too 'toxic', the ionic smoke alarm remained silent.

Photoelectric smoke alarms were made mandatory in NT in November 2011.

Mr Hamon said there was enough evidence to persuade emergency service authorities to make the change permanent.

He said it was required in every residence in the state, including demountables, caravans, transportables and safari-style tents.

Asked whether or not the move had been effective, Mr Hamon said it was 'early days yet but anything to save lives.

In a fire simulation on 60 Minutes, photoelectric smoke alarms were more react

David Isaac wants to see this requirement imposed in every state in Australia, saying it would drive down numbers of house fire deaths, which is 50 to 150 people a year.  

'Typically people who die in house fires die while they’re asleep from fires that develop from a long-smouldering phase, which could be an electrical fault, could be a cigarette on a couch, could be clothes in a dryer and the dryer has malfunctioned,' Mr Isaac said.

'The time when the occupants need to get the warning [is] before the house fills with smoke.'

Ionic alarms were installed inside the home the Lales and Taufas died in, and had been turned off because they had gone off at the wrong times.

But Mr Isaac said there was 'no doubt' in his mind that if a photoelectric alarm instead it would not have been disconnected.

'There’s no doubt in my mind if [the Lales and Taufas] had a photoelectric smoke alarm in that home they would not have been disconnected... and would have given precious minutes of advanced notice of a fire,' he said.

Mr Isaac said people could prevent a tragedy such as the Slacks Creek fire from happening again by buying a four-pack of photoelectric smoke alarms from the hardware store for $49.

But the Australian Building Codes Board - who decided the smoke alarm requirements of homes - are hesitant to make photoelectrics mandatory in households, despite it being so for commercial buildings, including hospitals, shopping centres and hotels.

'It has not been demonstrated to the board’s satisfaction that one performs better in all circumstances than the other,' the board's Neil Savery told 60 Minutes.

'Ultimately if there is an overwhelming body of evidence that that's the case then the board would obviously give that serious consideration but it won't be reflected as mandating necessarily a particular product.'
