As victory celebrations go, this wasn't a banner moment for the Mighty Mites of Wallkill, New York.

The entirely pee wee football team got sacked as players tried to crash through a vinyl victory banner after a game. 

The result is a hilarious pile-on as player after player hits the banner like it's a brick wall.

The two mothers who were holding the banner refused to let go, even as they watched the 5- and 6-year-olds of the Mighty Mites stumble head-first into disaster.

Disaster waiting to happen: The Mighty Mites of Wallkill, New York, hit a wall when they ran into a victory banner that was meant to burst in half with their force

And they all fall down: The players ended up in a heap after the team-building stunt went comically, horribly wrong

The scene was meant to re-create the dramatic entrances of NFL teams who burst through paper banners to enter the field.

Pint-sized cheerleaders even lined the path to cheer on the conquering players. 

By the end, though, all of them were in a heap and their cheer squad was reduced to giggles.

One even jumped with joy at the spectacle. 

The parent who posted the video on YouTube revealed that the hilarious moment came after the team's first home game. 

They won 24-0. 

At least somebody's happy: One little cheerleader was so fully with glee by the team's failure that she jumped with joy
