California's Latino population is going to overtake the white population in only two months, according to this year's state budget report.

The state is also getting older, with the population of over 65s predicted to hit a boom over the coming months.

The state has been getting more diverse for a while, but now the Latino population will be 'the single largest race or ethnic group', and it's thought to be because most Latino groups are in their prime childbearing years.

The Latino community have long been the minority among the large and mixed population of California, but this year's budget predicts that they will finally overtake the non-white Hispanic population by 0.2 per cent

According to the 2013-2014 report, by March Latinos will make up 39 per cent of California's population of 38.2 million, and non-Hispanic whites will make up 38.8 per cent.

This means that Latino population outstrips the white population by around only 76,400 people.

This change was actually predicted to happen seven moths ago, but Latino birth rates were lower than predicted.

The figures from last years budget show that the gap is closing between the two demographic groups.

In the demographic report for 2011-2012 whites made up 40 per cent of California's population and Hispanics made up 39 per cent.

This is dramatically different to 25 years ago, where whites made up around 57 per cent of California's population and Latinos only made up around 26 per cent.

The report, which in addition to detailing California's annual budget, predicts social and demographic trends, also predicted that the California has an ageing population.

The number of residents aged 65 and older will rise by 20.7 per cent over the next five years, and 18-45 year-olds will suffer a 4.5 per cent decline, as over 1,000 Californians turn 65 every day.

This change in the majority ethnicity and the average state age is thought to have severe impacts on the democratic changes to California over the next 15 years.

Mindy Romero, director of the California Civic Engagement Project said: 'Demographic changes that are coming will reshape the electorate.

The median age of the Latino population has reached 28, which are said to be prime childbearing years, and is thought to be the reason for Latino population overtaking the non-white hispanic population

'In turn that will likely have impacts on policies and issues that decision makers focus on in the coming decades'

'A big question mark is about what that means for policy for youth.

'Older voters often aren't as supportive of youth-specific policies.'

In addition, Asian groups are predicted to rise from a current 13 per cent, but because of immigration rather than increased birthing rates.

Bruce Mirken, spokesman for the Greenling institute, a group that advocates for communities of colour, said that the government and private sector both need to adapt to these predictions.

He said: 'It's less about one group being a couple tenths more of the population than another group, but more about a continuing trend for California being a majority-minority state'

'Everything that government does, that private industry does, needs to react to that reality.'

Overall, the state, that has had steady growth over the last economic year, is predicted to have a 300,000 population rise by July of 2014.
