Floyd Mayweather's superfight against Manny Pacquiao on May 2 is to be conducted under the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) testing program.

The welterweight rivals have agreed that their Las Vegas showdown will observe the rules established under the World Anti-Doping Code (Code), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List and the USADA Protocol for Olympic and Paralympic Movement Testing.

Both fighters have agreed to unannounced blood and urine testing without reservation and will be tested out of competition prior to the fight and in competition after the fight.

Some of the banned substances that will be tested for at the WADA-accredited laboratory are growth hormone (HGH), erythropoietin (EPO) and the use of carbon isotope ratio (CIR).

'It's a strong statement of the importance of clean and safe competition to have these two fighters voluntarily agree to have a WADA level anti-doping program implemented for this fight,' said USADA chief executive Travis Tygart.

'We commend them for their stance on clean sport and the message it sends to all those who want to compete clean at the highest levels of all sport.'

Mayweather vs Pacquiao is widely considered to be one of the biggest boxing fights of all-time 

Mayweather and Pacquiao are set to earn hundreds of millions from the blockbuster fight 

Plans for the pair to clash five years ago when at the peak of their powers were abandoned after Pacquiao refused to participate in blood testing at Mayweather's insistence.

The two went head to head for the first and only time prior to their collision at the MGM Grand at a press conference in Los Angeles on Wednesday. No publicity tour has been scheduled and they will not meet again until fight week.

The showdown is set to be the richest in boxing history, with an estimated shared purse of 250,000,000 US dollars (£167.4million).
