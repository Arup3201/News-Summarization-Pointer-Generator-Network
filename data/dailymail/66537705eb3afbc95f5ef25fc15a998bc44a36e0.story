Police forces across Britain are investigating 7,500 child abuse allegations, including historic cases at children's care homes.

The greatest number of investigations are taking place in London and West Yorkshire, where collectively almost 3,000 abuse claims have been made, a report says.

The report also found that prisoners were released to live near children's homes, including convicts who require constant monitoring by the police.

The findings by radio station LBC reveal that thousands of cases of child abuse are being investigated by police forces across the nation.

Scotland Yard are holding 1,800 inquiries into abuse allegations in London, while West Yorkshire Police are conducting another 1,100 inquiries. 

Many of the vulnerable young people involved are living in children's homes, the report says, as were the victims of previous abuse scandals in Rotherham and Rochdale.

Children as young as 16 are being abandoned without anywhere to live, the report, named Couldn't Care Less, claims.

Thousands are running away from children’s homes, with many then placed in unsuitable bed and breakfast accommodation, it adds.

LBC's report also criticises the areas children are made to live in.

The station found five children's homes in Cliftonville, Kent, where at least 23 prisoners were released to live nearby.

A further 30 'dangerous' criminals in the area are constantly monitored by police, while there were nearly 600 ambulance call-outs for assaults, drug overdoses and suicide attempts. 

The report says: 'Perhaps now we see why those children in our care are able to be abused so badly in places like Rotherham Oxford and Rochdale. We’re not protecting them.

'The government is trying to change things: laws, more safeguards, better training for staff. But we’ve been here before.

'The victims of child abuse are getting their inquiry with or without a chairperson.

'But this abuse is far from historical. It’s happening today. In your town to children you are paying to protect.'
