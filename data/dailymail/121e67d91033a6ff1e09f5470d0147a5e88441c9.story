He is the hungry little feline who has been voted the UK's favourite celebrity cat.

And his animated adventures have notched up almost 300 million views on YouTube.

Now Simon's Cat - the purring pal of award-winning London-based animator Simon Tofield - stars in both his first full-length colour book and an accompanying animation, seen here in a MailOnline exclusive.

Simon's Cat Vs The World is the four-legged creature's fourth outing in book format, and sees the little chap taking on the environment beyond his home.

Tofield told MailOnline: 'This time around I've spent longer on
each drawing which has resulted in really detailed illustrations, much 
more detailed than drawings in my previous books.

'Combined with the colour it makes 
each page have more depth. There are many more things to discover on 
subsequent visits to the book that you might not catch first time 
around.'

The book follows on from 2009's Simon's 
Cat: In His Very Own Book (2009), Simon's Cat: Beyond The Fence (2010), 
Simon's Cat 3: In Kitten Chaos (2011), and a mini colour slip book, 
Simon's Cat: Feed Me, published earlier this year.

A spokesman for its publishers, Canongate, said: 'The other stories have been about Simon's Cat and his owner, Simon, and have seen new characters being introduced gradually.

'In this one he takes himself a bit 
further in the garden and tries to make his place in the world and 
become the boss of his own story...often failing.'

The accompanying preview video, seen exclusively below, features the cheeky chappie attacking a bird house up a tree in the garden...and being surprised by what he finds inside.

At the end of the video - which is in the series' standard monochrome format - there is a colour sneak preview of what the book will look like.

Tofield, 39, launched the animated 
adventures of Simon's Cat on YouTube in 2008.

His cartoon pet has since 
become an online star, with his own channel proving the third most 
popular series on the site and racking up over one million subscribers.

Hilarious animations - which are, as any cat-owner knows, absurdly realistic - include Cat Man Do, Let 
Me In!, TV Dinner and The Box.

The 15 mini features, which usually run to up to three minutes per episode, see Simon's pet using increasingly dramatic 
measures to get the attention of his owner in effort to be fed, let inside the house or played with.

Why has Simon's Cat now gone in to colour?

I've actually been creating colour Simon's Cat drawings for a while already and posting them on the Simon's Cat website.

Colour lets me more accurately portray animals, which are very important to the world of Simon's Cat.

Personally I love looking at wildlife and nature, and getting the colours right on birds and other fauna is a great pleasure for me.Why do you think it will be successful?

It's not only the colour that I have worked on in my new book.

This time around I've spent longer on each drawing which has resulted in really detailed illustrations, much more detailed than drawings in my previous books.

Combined with the colour it makes each page have more depth. There are many more things to discover on subsequent visits to the book that you might not catch first time around.

It's definitely fun to look through, and I even surprise myself when I spot something I'd forgotten I'd drawn.What is interesting about this film in particular?

Without giving too much away, it is a film that shows how a cat's curiosity can sometimes have unexpected results! Are there any plans to make the Simon's Cat films in colour one day?

For the time being the Simon's Cat films online will remain in black and white. The films have a signature look and style that people recognise, understand and are comfortable with.

The films are short - one to two minutes long - and simplicity is an asset in films of this length. That's not to say we'll never see colour in a Simon's Cat film. There have been experiments...

Tofield received his first cat, a stray rescued from a farmer's barn, at the age of nine.

He has since had four cats, with the youngest, Teddy, being the primary inspiration behind this new book.

Simon's Cat was voted the UK's favourite Celebrity Cat at this year's National Cat 
Awards.

He also starred in an exhibition at London's Cartoon Museum, alongside Nick Park's Gromit and David Lowes TUC Carthorse.

The new 96-page book is on sale in hardback on Thursday, priced Â£12.99.
