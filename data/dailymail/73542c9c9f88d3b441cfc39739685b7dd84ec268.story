Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood will be replaced at the end of the season - with Louis Van Gaal their No 1 choice to take over.

Sherwood took over from Andre Villas-Boas in December and had signed an 18-month contract with the club, but will step down as they look for other options.

The 45-year-old told Sky Sports: 'I can't say much right now. What I can say is tonight (Monday) is business as usual.

Tim Sherwood has a higher Premier League win percentage, 56.3 per cent, than any Spurs manager (stat from Opta).

'I'm setting this team up to win a football match for the benefit of the club and the 35,000 Spurs fans who will come and watch.

'I'll speak at a later stage.'

Holland coach Louis van Gaal is the leading candidate to replace the 45-year-old, although the Tottenham 
board are also considering a move for Southampton's Mauricio Pochettino and Carlo Ancelotti if he leaves Real Madrid

Sherwood will reportedly still be offered a coaching role under the next manager but it isn't yet known whether the former Blackburn captain will accept that.

Van Gaal looks the most likely candidate for the job as the Dutchman is due to step down from international management after the 2014 World Cup.
