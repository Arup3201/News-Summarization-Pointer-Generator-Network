Frustrated by an increase in petty crime, residents of an Oregon neighborhood have decided to arm themselves instead of calling the police.

Residents of a Jennings Lodge neighborhood in Clackamas county, Ore., have put up fliers advertising their new policy, calling themselves the 'Glock Block', according to KOIN News.

'This is a Glock Block,' the fliers read. 'We don't call 911.'

Fed-up: Residents of a Clackamas County, Ore., neighborhood have started posting fliers telling criminals they are a 'glock block' and that they don't rely on police for protection

Along with some of her neighbors, Coy Toloman has put up the fliers and gotten a concealed carry permit with the hopes of deterring criminals.

While the increase in neighborhood crime is mostly petty, with incidents of vandalism and stolen law ornaments, Toloman has had enough.

'We’re starting a new group,' said Toloman, a resident of Milwaukie, which is just south of Portland, Ore. 'We don’t feel neighborhood watch is sufficient, and we don’t feel the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office is sufficient.'

Toloman said a lawn statue she calls 'Lilly Rose' was stolen off her front porch. She chased after the thief but he got away.

'The radio was on,' she said of the incident.'If he'd gotten in the house...what then?'

Toloman decided to take matters into her own hands, taking a class to get a concealed carry permit.

Other neighbors also have permits, Toloman said, and they discus 'what kind of gun they have' and 'the best gun shop'.

Packing heat: Coy Toloman said got a concealed carry gun permit after petty crime increased in her neighborhood. She said most of her Milwaukie neighbors have gun permits, too

Stolen: Coy Toloman said she got a gun after her statue, which she calls 'Lilly Rose', was taken off her front porch when she was home

'I think more people should have permits to carry but they should be trained and responsible,'said Toloman, who is also a breast cancer survivor.

She hopes criminals will see the fliers before trying to rob her again—or worse.

'I will defend myself and my home,' she said.

Police make a note of cautioning anyone from pursuing vigilante justice, though armed citizens have become more common deterrents to crime.

In northwest Houston, Texas, residents in the the community of Oak Forest were the first to be trained and equipped by the Armed Citizen Project this month, the Associated Press reported.

The Houston nonprofit is giving away free shotguns to single women and other residents of high-crime neighborhoods. Armed Citizen Project plans to offer training in other cities in Texas and Arizona and would like to expand to Chicago and New York this year.
