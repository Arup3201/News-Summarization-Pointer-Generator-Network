Sunderland defender Santiago Vergini has been called into the Argentina squad for the first time since 2012 for next month's games against Brazil and Hong Kong.

Vergini made his only previous international appearance against the Selecao two years ago and will be given a chance to face them again after being named in coach Gerardo Martino's squad for the October 11 clash in Beijing. The game against Hong Kong follows three days later.

Tigres keeper Nahuel Guzman, Benfica midfielder Nicolas Gaitan and Juventus midfielder Roberto Pereyra are also included but there is no place for Pereyra's club-mate Carlos Tevez.

Martino has said several times he is prepared to recall the striker, who was left out of this summer's World Cup by previous coach Alejandro Sabella, but preferred Sergio Aguero and Gonzalo Higuain for the upcoming matches.

'Tevez is doing his job well on the field,' Martino told ESPN. 'As Carlitos had said in an interview - he is working hard in order to be selected.'

Vergini and Aguero are two of a host of Premier League players in the squad alongside Aguero's Manchester City team-mates Martin Demichelis and Pablo Zabaleta, Manchester United pair Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo, Tottenham's Erik Lamela and Swansea's Federico Fernandez.
