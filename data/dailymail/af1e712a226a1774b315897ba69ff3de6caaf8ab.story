An 80-year-old man could be prosecuted after he shot a robber dead even though she was fleeing his house and saying she was pregnant.

Homeowner Tom Greer took direct action with a .22-caliber Smith & Wesson revolver on Tuesday night after he was 'jumped on' by two intruders at his home in Long Beach, California.

When he drew his gun the unarmed man the woman both ran away, but the woman could not flee fast enough and was shot twice in the back.

Force: His arm in a sling, 80-year-old Tom Greer told NBC Los Angeles: 'They downed me, they jumped on me in the hallway... She says "don't shoot me, I'm pregnant, I'm gonna have a baby" and I shot her anyway'

Now Mr Greer is being investigated after he gave a vivid account to a journalist - which suggested the woman was down an alleyway when she was shot.

His arm in a sling, he told NBC Los Angeles: 'I walked in on them and they downed me, they jumped on me in the hallway.

'The lady didn't run as fast as the man so I shot her in the back twice. She's dead.. but he got away. She says "don't shoot me, I'm pregnant, I'm gonna have a baby" and I shot her anyway.

'I shot her so that's going to leave a message on his mind for the rest of his life.'

According to the station, he then said: 'She was dead. I shot her twice, she best be dead... (The man) had run off and left her.'

Upmarket: The shooting happened at his home (pictured) in the Bixby Knolls neighbourhood. Mr Greer's remarks to local news station NBC Los Angeles could land him in hot water with Long Beach's police

The Long Beach Police Department is investigating the incident, which took place in the upmarket neighbourhood of Bixby Knolls.

Officers have not revealed whether the woman - who remains unnamed - was shot in the immediate surroundings of Mr Greer's home or down an alleyway as she escaped.

The distinction could make all the difference as to whether Mr Greer is prosecuted for taking self-defense too far.

California's self-defense laws allow homeowners to use force to protect themselves, other people or their property.

But the force must be no more than is reasonably necessary and it must defend against immediate danger - solving a possible threat in the future is not enough.

Fatal: The investigation could hinge on whether or not the woman was shot down this alleyway as she fled

In January police in Orlando, Florida, charged a 32-year-old man with second degree murder after he chased and shot a man he claimed was trying to burgle his apartment.

Officers arrested Claudius Smith after finding 21-year-old Ricardo Sanes lying dead on the grass surrounded by six shell casings.

Mr Greer's neighbour George Romero told CBS Los Angeles burglars had struck at the pensioner's home before.

'I remember the first break-in,' he said. 'They literally tore down the front door.'

It is believed the male accomplice is still on the run. Long Beach Police could not be reached for further comment.
