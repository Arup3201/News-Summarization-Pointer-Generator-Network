Models in wheelchairs, a blind lady and female amputees took to the catwalk at Tokyo fashion week on Wednesday as the Japanese capital became the latest to embrace diversity on the runway. 

The models were showing off designs for Takafumi Tsuruta's label Tenbo during the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Tokyo, which runs from March 16th - 21st.

The designer strives to create clothes with handicapped people in mind and called  blind on Paralympic gold medal swimmer, Rina Akiyamaand, and ladies with prosthetic limbs to showcase his designs.

 Tsuruta designed the line of outfits for all people, including those with disabilities, using items such as magnetic buttons for users to put and take off clothes easily.

Many of the models also wore vibrant yellow wigs and one lady's oversized furry wig was filled with toy sheep.

This isn't the first designer to use disabled models on the catwalk. The FTL Moda's AW15 show in Milan, which featured international designers with a 'Made in Italy' theme, showcased disabled models from all over the world alongside some of the industry's most esteemed clothes horses.

Named FTL Moda Loving You, the show was held in collaboration with Fondazione Vertical - an Italian foundation supporting research to find a cure for spinal cord injuries. 

London-based Models of Diversity, an agency that campaigns for greater diversity of modelling talent in the media and on the catwalk, was also involved.

It comes after American Horror Story actress Jamie Brewer became the first woman with Down syndrome to walk the runway last Thursday, as she strutted the catwalk in Carrie Hammer’s show.

British personal trainer Jack Eyers became the first male amputee model to strut his stuff on the catwalk in the show.
