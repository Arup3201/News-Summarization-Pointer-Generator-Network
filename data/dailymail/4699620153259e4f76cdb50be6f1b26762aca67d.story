Elderly patients could be given unhealthy treats to encourage them to eat, a leading doctor said

Junk food should be served to older patients on wards to prevent malnutrition, the health boss in charge of hospital food has said.

Elderly people could be given unhealthy treats such as doughnuts, ice cream and chips in order to encourage them to eat as part of an overhaul of hospital food.

Dr Liz Jones, head of environment at the Department of Health, who is responsible for policy on hospital food, said it was more important patients ate food they liked rather than leave healthy food uneaten.

Ministers are also concerned at the high cost of the 30million uneaten meals that are thrown away annually. It is feared many uneaten dishes are recipes that elderly patients would not normally eat, such as Thai curry.

Speaking at Age UK’s For Later Life 
conference, the doctor warned that older people at risk of not eating enough had
 become ‘terrified’ because of anti-obesity campaigns.

Dr Jones said: ‘We know that patients need better nutritional care because if they do not eat enough they will get sicker quicker and better slower.

‘If we give them nice food it will make them feel better.

'When you’re poorly you almost always 
lose your appetite. You might not lose it completely, but you will go 
off certain things at least. There are virtually no serious illnesses 
that lead to an increase in appetite.

‘We know that one hundred junk calories inside is a lot better than 500 healthy calories that you just look at.'

Dr Jones, who is currently conducting a major review of hospital food, said promoting healthy eating was important but making sure patients ate is what ‘worries me’.

She said: ‘We could say we should concentrate on making sure that people eat. It doesn’t matter what it is, just as long as they eat, even that food is unhealthy, we should concentrate on helping them to eat, because if we don’t they’ll get sicker.

‘But there’s also this thought that we have to consider, maybe we should concentrate on healthy food because people are affected by obesity and the NHS should set a good example.

‘They’re both important, but really it’s the first that worries me. It’s about getting patients to eat and particularly elderly patients.’

Dr Liz Jones said calories from items such as doughnuts, crisps and ice-cream were better for patients for nothing at all

She added that there was a risk that the elderly were put off eating because of healthy eating campaigns.

She said: ‘I think there is an awful talked about obesity to the extent that people have become terrified of any kind of putting on weight, they see it as a bad thing.’

Dr Jones is drawing up national standards, which will be issued in September as part of the hospital food review by the government and Age UK.

It follows concerns that a third of vulnerable patients are not being given enough help at meal times, risking malnutrition and dehydration.

Many are too frail even to open cling-film or cardboard packaging and are left struggling as nursing staff move on to the next bed.

Ministers are also concerned at the high cost of waste as 30 million uneaten meals are thrown away annually. It is feared many dishes consist of recipes that elderly patients would not normally eat, like Thai curry.

Dianne Jeffrey, chairman of Age UK, who is chairing the review panel, told the conference: ‘Malnutrition is a word we often associate with developing countries, but actually there are a million older people living in our community who are already malnourished or at risk at becoming so.

‘When older people are malnourished they are much greater risk of poor health, more likely to go into hospital, and need more time to recover.

‘In many cases, malnutrition is preventable with the right help and support. This is a hugely serious and often hidden problem.

‘Older people and professionals tend to assume that losing weight and loss of appetite is a normal part of ageing, but that is not the case.’
