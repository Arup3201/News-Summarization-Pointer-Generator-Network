Upset: Actor Andrew Sachs and his wife Melody

The wife of actor Andrew Sachs criticised the BBC last night for an interview with Russell Brand in which he blamed the Sachsgate scandal on ‘dishonest’ reporting.

Melody Sachs said yesterday’s edition of flagship Radio 4 programme Desert Island Discs featuring the comedian was ‘very, very nasty to hear’ and an ‘insult’ to her husband.

And she accused the corporation of helping Brand promote his new comedy tour by allowing him on a string of recent programmes, including Question Time and The Andrew Marr Show.

Brand used his radio appearance to provide his own version of the 2008 scandal, in which he and presenter Jonathan Ross left a series of obscene messages on Mr Sachs’s answerphone during Brand’s Radio 2 programme.

The incident provoked 42,000 complaints after Brand boasted of sleeping with Mr Sachs’s granddaughter and joked that the 83-year-old former Fawlty Towers star might hang himself as a result of the phone calls.

Brand later resigned while Ross was suspended.

But interviewed by Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young, 38-year-old Brand suggested the controversy was manufactured by the Daily Mail and media outlets with a ‘pre-existing agenda’.

Brand insisted he is now ‘contrite’, but Mrs Sachs said last night: ‘He didn’t apologise. It was a pathetic little rendition of what actually happened.

‘And the thing that upset me the most was that he claimed people weren’t upset by what he and Jonathan Ross did to Andrew. He said it was the Daily Mail which had whipped up public opinion. That simply isn’t true. People were very upset because of the terrible abuse we endured.’

Criticising the BBC’s decision to invite Brand on Desert Island Discs, the 79-year-old added: ‘What we had to listen to was disgusting and unnecessary. It was very, very nasty to hear. Andrew has spent a lifetime working at the BBC. This was an insult.’

Brand has appeared on a string of BBC programmes since announcing his Messiah Complex world tour last month, including Question Time, The Andrew Marr Show and the Radio 1 breakfast show.

Criticising the BBC for giving him so much airtime, Mrs Sachs said: ‘A lot of water has passed under the bridge since that humiliating phone call and, knowing how the BBC always look after their own, I am surprised that they consider Russell Brand to be one of them.

‘My husband and I are rather surprised that he’s got away with it. We try not to think about what happened and remember the hundreds of letters of support we received at the time. But he did not apologise [on Desert Island Discs].’

Further controversy: Russell Brand suggested it was a 'dishonest scandal' that was hijacked by those against the BBC

During his Radio 4 appearance, Brand insisted he was sorry for making the notorious phone call, saying: ‘I am contrite. Anything that damages something I love, I’m going to feel sorry for.

'And I feel sorry also because the story I tell myself, of myself, is not that I’m a man that is rude to people who are in a position of vulnerability.’

But he said the subsequent controversy was the product of ‘a pre-existing agenda in privately owned media to destabilise, attack and diminish the BBC’.

Despite admitting that those who complained in the wake of the scandal were genuinely offended, he added: ‘That was a dishonest scandal... The thing that the 42,000 people were offended by is offensive. It is offensive if someone calls up an answerphone, does some swearing, hangs up.

'But if incrementally that act is led to by a series of innuendos and in-jokes, then it’s a different thing. It’s still a thing that is wrong, but it’s not the thing that they’re offended by.’

Following the Sachsgate scandal the BBC was fined £150,000 by Ofcom, the controller of Radio 2 resigned and the BBC issued multiple on-air apologies.

Last night a BBC spokesman said: ‘Desert Island Discs features a range of people from scientists to politicians, academics and actors. Kirsty asks and challenges the castaways about the defining and at times controversial moments in their lives, as she did on this occasion as well.’
