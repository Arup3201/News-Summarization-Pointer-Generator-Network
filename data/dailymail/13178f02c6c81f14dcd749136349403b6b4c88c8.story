This crazy komodo dragon does not show a hint of camera shyness as it shows off its dance skills for a lucky photographer.

The Rumbaing reptile was spotted in a park near amateur photographer Woe Hendrick Husin's home in Surabaya, Indonesia, while he was out searching for local wildlife.

Although the lizard was busy hunting insects, it still had time to stop and perform a quick dance before dashing off into the bushes in search of its next meal.

Woe was not in any danger when the picture was taken as the komodo is only young.

It is unlikely that it would ever have come so close had it been an adult.

As adults they can reach 10 feet in length and weigh more than 300 pounds, making them the heaviest lizards on Earth.

They can eat a remarkable 80 per cent of their body weight in a single feeding.

Woe said 'I spotted some movement in the bushes while out looking for wildlife and as I got closer I could see the lizard jumping around trying to catch insects.

'I couldnâ€™t believe the picture when I got home and checked my camera, the picture is hilarious.

'There was nobody else around when I saw the lizard so I think the performance was especially for me.

'When I showed my photographer friends and they kept asking how I managed to get the lizard to dance for me?

'At no point was I in danger as the Komodo is not very old but I would never have approached a full grown adult as they are extremely dangerous.'
