William Hague announced mroe sanctions on Russians - adding current violent in Ukraine was 'deplorable'

William Hague announced new sanctions on Russia yesterday, as escalating violence in Ukraine left the mayor of its second city fighting for his life.

The EU is set to slap travel bans and asset freezes on another 15 individuals today, including members of Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.

Hours earlier Barack Obama announced the US would extend their sanctions to seven more oligarchs close to Mr Putin, and 17 businesses linked to them.

In an update on the crisis, Mr Hague told the Commons the latest clashes yesterday - in which the mayor of the city of Kharkiv in eastern Ukraine was shot in the back - were ‘deplorable’.

The Mayor, Hennady Kernes, a controversial figure for both sides, was reportedly out cycling on the city’s outskirts when approached by an unknown gunman. He was in a ‘grave but stable’ condition last night, his office said.

A former supporter of the ousted pro-Russian president Viktor Yanukoych and critic of the pro-EU protests which deposed him, he has recently spoken out for a united Ukraine and against the pro-Moscow insurgents who have seized government buildings, set up roadblocks and called for Russian annexation of eastern Ukraine.

Western countries accuse Moscow of supporting these separatist gunmen occupying official buildings in several eastern cities and last week seized seven Western military observers.

Mr Hague, who was questioned by some MPs about why the sanctions fell short of a boycott of Russia’s financial and energy interests, said preparations for a third tier of EU sanctions, which would have far reaching economic and trade measures were ‘well advanced’.

The 15 individuals announced yesterday takes the number of Russians subject to EU sanctions to 48. Their names will be released by the EU today. The US list hits close aides of Mr Putin, including Igor Sechin, a former KGB officer now head of oil giant Rosneft.

Mr Hague said £63 billion worth of capital has been moved out of Russia since the crisis began, and its economy is forecast to shrink this year. ‘Russia is already paying a serious price for its actions and the longer it breaches the independent sovereignty of Ukraine the heavier the price it will pay’, he said.

‘Russia’s actions betray their fear of democracy and the rule of law taking root in their neighbourhood. These actions are not consistent with being a strong and confident country and are also in breach of international agreements and the UN charter to which Russia is a party.

'It is in Russia’s power to help find ways for tensions to be reduced in Ukraine and the doors of diplomacy remain fully open.’

Mr Hague said the Ukrainian government had behaved with ‘immense restraint’ in the face of provocation, while the Russian government had failed to take ‘a single positive step’.

Over the past two weeks groups of masked militant with automatic weapons have been seizing government buildings in eastern cities to destabilise Ukraine -  in open defiance of a peace deal signed in Geneva last week, which called for them to be surrendered.

Yesterday gunmen took over a building in the city of Kostyantynivka – 100 miles from the Russian border.

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said Ukraine was the greatest threat to the European security order ‘in decades’ and raised the spectre of war again in Europe, which many people had thought was now ‘all but impossible’.

President Obama said the US was prepared to go further if the situation escalated. ‘The goal is not to go after Mr Putin personally,’ Mr Obama said, ‘The goal is to change his calculus with respect to how the current actions that he’s engaging in in Ukraine could have an adverse impact on the Russian economy over the long haul.’
