Nani has not spoken to Louis van Gaal since his loan move to Sporting Lisbon.

Manchester United's outcast Portugese winger says only executive vice chairman Ed Woodward has been in touch with him following his season-long switch – but added he would love to return to the club.

Nani also revealed to Sportsmail the reason behind his tearful celebration of last weekend's wonderstrike and failed to rule out a move to Everton when his stint at Sporting comes to an end.

The Portugal international returned to his first club in August following Van Gaal's arrival at United.

He capped a returned to form following a miserable campaign last year by thumping a sensational 30-yard volley against Gil Vicente but when asked if the Dutchman had contacted him to monitor his progress he said: 'No.'

'I receive some texts from Ed Woodward,' Nani added. 'He texted me about the goal and the great season I am having here.'

It would appear that Van Gaal is not the only one to lose touch, with Nani admitting he now rarely speaks to his United teammates.

'I used to speak to Antonio Valencia but I changed my number so it's difficult,' he said.

Nani, who signed a five-year contract extension at Old Trafford in 2013, says he made the decision to leave United because he thought playing time would be limited under Van Gaal.

'I knew with the new manager it would be more difficult because of the new system and my position in it,' he explained.

'I knew it would be hard to play. I decided to go to Sporting because it was an opportunity to come home, feel comfortable, get games and feel strong again.'

He has done just that, although a video clip of him reduced to tears following Sunday's goal went viral.

'The game before against Wolfsburg I couldn't do my best,' he said.

'I ended the game wishing I could have done more. I prepared myself to do my best and after the goal I thanked God who helped me be my best.'

Nani is expecting to return to United at the end of his loan spell but admitted his future, with Everton known admirers, was uncertain.

'At the moment I just focus on my job here,' he said. 'I'll do my best and get in the best condition I can, then come back as strong as possible and see what the manager or the club want from me.

'I love Man United. I love the club. The only decision I made to go away was to play more and be me again because I lost a lot of things there last season because of injuries and the change of the manager. The new manager didn't know me well and a lot of things changed. I needed to play regularly to be happy.

'You never know the future. It depends on a lot of things. If Man United want me to stay then, with different mentality I think we can work well next season but it's a lot of things to discuss and see.'

Nani, speaking on behalf of BT Sport ahead of Porto v Sporting which is live on ESPN this Sunday, is not surprised that United have struggled to adapt to life under Van Gaal but added that he thinks they will qualify for the Champions League.

'It's normal when a lot of things change,' he said. 'The results are always different. We know it is just a moment and everything will be OK. We'll be the number one of England again.'

United have been linked with a move for Nani's Sporting teammate, William Carvalho.

And he thinks the tough tackling defensive midfielder would be a hit at Old Trafford.

'He is a great player,' said Nani.

'He has a lot of quality. I think at the end of this season he will be prepared to play in the Premier League. I think if Manchester United are interested it's a good chance.'

William Carvalho, previously linked with a move to Man United, is a great player according to compatriot Nani

BT Sport brings fans multiple live games from Portugal’s Primeira Liga every week as part of a continental European football line-up including UEFA Europa League, Germany’s Bundesliga, France’s Ligue 1 and Italy’s Serie A, alongside top-flight British football from the Barclays Premier League and the FA Cup.
