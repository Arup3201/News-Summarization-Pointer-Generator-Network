A Wisconsin man who has fathered nine children with six different women was ordered to stop having babies until he can support his existing dependents.

Corey Curtis, 44, of Racine, Wisconsin, owes about $90,000 in back child support and interest to the mothers of his children.

At his December 3 sentencing for bail jumping and failure to pay child support, a circuit court judge ordered Curtis to curb his excessive breeding as a condition of a three-year probation term.

The judge said Curtis will need to clear his debt before he can have his tenth child, the Smoking Gun reports.

Curtis has been arrested and charged with failure to pay child support on numerous occasions over the past 11 years, court records show.

Curtis’ record includes convictions for passing bad checks, criminal damage and burglary.

Other deadbeat dads have been given similar demands in the past.In March 2002, a judge ordered Luther Crawford of Kentucky, who had 12 children with 11 women, to stop having sex in an effort to keep him from having his 13th child.
