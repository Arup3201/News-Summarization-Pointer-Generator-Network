The newly-married couple, who are both 27 and have been together for three years, made their vows in front of 200 guests.

The ceremony united traditions from both Mr Modisane's Tswana and Mr Sithole's Zulu ancestry, including traditional dancing and the ritual sacrifice of a cow to honour the two men's ancestors, as well as an an exchange of gifts between the two grooms' families.

Tshepo Modisane, now Sithol, said: 'I love Thoba so much, I'm very excited we're both Mr Sithol.

'There is an idea that being gay is against being African, but being gay is as African as being black, so it's part of our culture and we are rooted in our culture.'

The couple have been together for three years and will have a smaller, intimate ceremony in Johannesburg later this year

Vows: The couple now hope to have a child through a surrogate mother

The two also plan to have children through a surrogate. In February Tshepo told Mamba Online: 'We are so blessed to have supportive families who care about us. Even though we are gay they still love us.

'Family is important to us and that is the number one reason why we want to have children.

'We also want our children to grow up in an environment where they are loved greatly by both parents who appreciate them.'
