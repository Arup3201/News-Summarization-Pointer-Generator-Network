the Lib Dem Business Secretary attacked the Tories’ economic plans, which involve slicing another £24billion from public spending

Vince Cable has publicly denounced George Osborne’s plans to slash the budget deficit within four years, and urged his party to oppose ‘brutal’ spending cuts.

In an extraordinary intervention which puts further strain on the Coalition, the Lib Dem Business Secretary attacked the Tories’ economic plans, which involve slicing another £24billion from public spending during the next Parliament.

He claimed whichever party is in power next year will have to raise taxes, and even said he agreed with Labour that the next government should borrow more.

Mr Cable said he ‘did not recognise’ the Chancellor’s plan to eliminate the deficit and run a surplus by 2018-19.

He also said: ‘We do have differences in emphasis. The Tories would like to cut spending rather more brutally than we think is necessary or desirable.’

His attack came as his party’s leader Nick Clegg shunned the Autumn Statement yesterday.

In a highly unusual move, the Deputy Prime Minister chose to stay away – and instead flew 300 miles to Penzance to talk to locals about flood defences.

Senior Lib Dems have warned him that he needs to distance himself from the Tories in the run up to the General Election – though Mr Clegg insisted his decision was not a snub.

Mr Cable confirmed he had asked the Office for Budget Responsibility to map out a different forecast for the Lib Dems which contained fewer spending cuts.

He added ‘all parties will have to increase taxation whether they say so or not’. On eliminating the deficit, he told LBC Radio: ‘I’m not sure I recognise the figures and the dates you are talking about. The budget deficit also includes borrowing for capital investment.

‘We think if there are good capital investments … for infrastructure and the government earns a proper return for the taxpayer, we should invest in it.’

Asked if this meant he agreed with Labour’s Ed Balls, he replied: ‘We do agree with them on that particular issue, and we differ from the Tories.’

Government sources said Mr Cable had ‘erupted’ yesterday morning and told fellow Lib Dems, including Chief Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander, that they had not signed up to the Conservatives’ spending plans beyond the general election.

Mr Cable said he ‘did not recognise’ Chancellor George Osborne’s (pictured) plan to eliminate the deficit and run a surplus by 2018-19.

On air, Mr Cable said the Lib Dems were committed to the deficit reduction plans until May.

He denied he had ordered his civil servants not to co-operate with Treasury officials.

Tory backbencher Andrew Rosindell said: ‘I don’t think any sensible person believes borrowing more money is the right approach for the country.’

Mr Alexander also distanced himself, saying: ‘It’s not the job of the Office for Budget Responsibility to set out the differences between parties.’

Mr Clegg said his decision to stay away from the Chancellor’s speech was ‘not a snub’, but ‘a nice change to get out of the Westminster bubble and say what this Autumn Statement means to people’.
