The animal oracle predictions for the World Cup have begun, with host nation Brazil getting a vote of confidence from its chosen turtle tipster.

By making a patriotic choice of food, loggerhead turtle Big Head predicted Tuesday that the host nation will beat Croatia in the opening game of the World Cup on Thursday.

Big Head is Brazil’s answer to Germany’s Paul the Octopus, who started the psychic animal craze during the 2010 World Cup and spawned a slew of imitations around the world.

Turtle tipster: Big Head the loggerhead turtle is backing Brazil to beat Croatia in the World Cup opener

Humble beginnings: The craze for animal oracles began with Paul the Octopus in 2010

At the Praia do Forte turtle sanctuary north of Salvador, the 25-year-old male sea turtle was given the choice between eating a fish hung from a Brazilian flag or a Croatian flag.

After attempting to eat the fish hung from a football indicating a draw, Big Head chose the one representing Brazil.

The small crowd of onlookers cheered in appreciation of Big Head’s choice.

P.S. Brazil's new sensation is not the first Big Head in football. Brian Clough was famously known as Old Big 'Ead for his self-confidence and acerbic opinions.

Pretenders: China will use a squad of Panda cubs to conduct their predictions this time round

Caught out: Paul eventually came unstuck when Germany lost to Spain in the World Cup semi-finals

End of the road: Luckily German fans took Paul's mistake in good spirits

The original: Former Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough was known as Old Big 'Ead
