Erica Ginnetti, 34, pleaded guilty on Tuesday in a Pennsylvania court to institutional sexual assault and disseminating sexually explicit materials to a minor

A high school math teacher from Pennsylvania has admitted having sex with a 17-year-old student and sending him inappropriate text messages and videos.

Erica Ginnetti, a married mom-of-three from Philadelphia, pleaded guilty on Tuesday in Montgomery County court to institutional sexual assault and disseminating sexually explicit materials to a minor.

The 34-year-old remains free on bail and faces a possible maximum of seven to 14 years in prison when she is sentenced.

She was fired by Lower Moreland Township School District after her arrest in January.

According to investigators, the math and calculus teacher first approached the victim in May 2013 when she chaperoned the senior prom and invited him to come work out at her gym.

A few days later the 17-year-old responded to Ginnetti with a text message, and the two began communicating on a daily basis.

The criminal complaint against Ginnetti says that over the next several months, she sent the minor sexually explicit text messages, photos depicting her wearing bikini, a thong and other underwear, and videos showing the woman undressing suggestively and performing a sexual act on herself, according to The Bucks County Courier Times.

According to officials, the illicit relationship culminated in July 2013 when Ginnetti and the student met for coffee in Starbucks and then drove to an industrial park to have sex in her car.

She then allegedly dropped her paramour back at the coffee shop and told him not to tell anyone about the encounter.

Authorities say the investigation began after they received a tip-off that students had been overheard discussing X-rated pictures showing a minor and Ginnetti doing 'sexual things.'

When police questioned the 17-year-old boy, he came clean about the affair and Ginnetti then also confessed to having a relationship with the student, police said.

‘I would say that she treated her relationship with this student as she would have treated a relationship with an adult with whom she was involved,’ Montgomery County District Attorney Risa Vetri Ferman told The Mercury News in January.

Police said they found several texts the lovers had exchanged discussing their July outing and one mentioning ‘a used condom that had been left in Ginnetti’s vehicle,’ according to the criminal complaint.

On the night of the alleged tryst, after he returned home, the student told police he got a text from Ginnetti asking him to ‘do it again.’

As part of her $50,000 bail condition in January, Ginnetti was forbidden from having unsupervised contact with any minors except for her own children, ages 8, 11 and 14. 

She also had to surrender her passport, and the authorities have been keeping track of her using a GPS device.
