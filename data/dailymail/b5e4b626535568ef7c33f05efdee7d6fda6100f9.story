Kenyan police today tear-gassed schoolchildren protesting against a politician's alleged move to seize their playground and turn it into a car park.

Pupils from Langata Road Primary School in Nairobi were at the front line of protesters pulling down a wall thrown up around their playground after it was acquired by a private developer.

At least 10 children were taken to hospital with injuries, including tear gas exposure to their eyes, Bloomberg reported citing local MP Kenneth Okoth. Tonight Nairobi's police chief said he had suspended the officer in charge of the protest.

In such an incident tear gas should not have been used because the protests were not violent, acting police chief Samuel Arachi said. He said five people have been arrested; three for vandalism and two for incitement.

'We will never allow officers to use force not only on any citizen more so on children whether in a demonstration or otherwise,' he said. 

Kenyan human rights activist Boniface Mwangi told the Associated Press that the developer on whose orders the playground was snatched was a powerful politician.

'The governor, the senator and other government officials are all scared of the politician, they cannot do anything to stop the playground from the being taken,' Mr Mwangi said.

Dozens of pupils aged from six to 13 joined in the protest, carrying placards proclaiming 'Land grabbing is terror against children', 'Kenya at 51 it's about our future', and 'Kenya: the land of the shameless grabbers'.

Together with adults who were present, the boys and girls pulled open tall metal gates which had blocked access to their school playground before running into the space. Once inside they pushed down at least one other wall put up to cordon off the site.  

About 40 police officers in riot gear then faced off with the children before hurling tear gas canisters into their midst.

Children screamed as police officers in riot gear and waving truncheons pushed them back, some panicking as they sought water to wash their burning eyes. Television footage showed children, some being carried away, writhing in pain, sobbing and gasping for breath because of the tear-gas.

Dozens of children were caught in the choking clouds of tear gas before being forced to shelter on a pedestrian bridge over the main road to escape the noxious fumes. Police officers later brought dogs to the playground. 

One policeman was pictured holding a tear-gas launcher in one hand and a truncheon in the other, as blood streamed down his face after he was hit in the face with a rock.

Police spokesman Masoud Mwinyi was not available for comment. A senior police officer at the demonstration, Mwangi Kuria, told Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper that officers had been deployed to 'safeguard the property', adding that rocks had been thrown at his men.

'This is disputed land, but they should not use the children,' the policeman was quoted as saying.

Two activists were detained by police, Kenyan media said. Macharia Njeru, chairman of the Independent Policing Oversight Authority, said the incident would be investigated. 'Teargassing children is inexcusable,' he said.

The incident has sparked outrage in Kenya and on social media where critics have been commenting on it under the hashtags 'OccupyPlayGround' and 'LangataPrimary'. Opposition leader Raila Odinga accused the police of 'brutality beyond words' and the developer of 'greed beyond description'.

'It is difficult to believe that police can actually deploy against primary school children and lob tear gas at them to defend a land grabber,' Mr Odinga said. 'This image of a nation determined to steal forcefully from its own children cannot be what we aspire to. It cannot be the legacy we want to bequeath the children.'

The demonstration came as reports emerged in local media that Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko had filed a court action to try to reclaim the playground. Mr Sonko told The Star that he had instructed lawyers to seek a court order to compel the developer to return the land to the school.

Opposition politician Eliud Owalo said last week that the playground had been grabbed to construct a parking lot for the politician's hotel adjacent to the school.

According to the organisers of today's demonstration the playground, which had been owned by the school since 1972, was fenced off over the Christmas holidays by a 'group of professional land grabbers' linked to a senior politician.

'Langata Road Primary School playground has been grabbed by a group of known professional land grabbers acting on behalf of a very senior politician in the (ruling coalition) Jubilee government', said activists in a statement
