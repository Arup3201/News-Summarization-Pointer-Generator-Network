Meteorologists working for the Canadian government's weather and meteorological body Environment Canada have been forbidden from publicly discussing climate change.

A government spokesperson said this week that the policy exists because its meteorologists aren't qualified to answer questions related to climate change.

The policy is part of a government-wide Communications Protocol introduced in August 2006, soon after Prime Minister Stephen Harper's Conservative party came to power.

Off limits: Meteorologists with the Canadian government are not permitted to publicly discuss climate change

'Environment Canada scientists speak to their area of expertise. For example, our Weather Preparedness Meteorologists are experts in their field of severe weather and speak to this subject,' government spokesperson Mark Johnson wrote in an email to journalist Mike De Souza.

'Questions about climate change or long-term trends would be directed to a climatologist or other applicable authority.'

Meteorologists are among the most oft-quoted government experts and according to Newsweek, half of all media inquiries received by Environment Canada are for them.

However, other federal scientists must seek official permission to speak to journalists and in some cases must have their responses approved by their superiors, as per Harper's Communications Protocol.

As a result of the often lengthy process, there has been a huge drop in interview requests for government scientists from major media organizations, which are often working on same-day deadlines.

According to a leaked Environment Canada document, the agency has noticed that 'Media coverage of climate change science, our most high profile issue, has been reduced by over 80 per cent.'

Critics say the government is seeking to 'muzzle' scientists from speaking about climate change.

According to a study
 by the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, many 
federal scientists feel they are unable to speak openly in their areas 
of expertise.'90 per cent
 [of federal scientists] feel they are not allowed to speak freely to 
the media about the work they do and that, faced with a departmental 
decision that could harm public health, safety or the environment, 
nearly as many (86 per cent) would face censure or retaliation for doing
 so,' reads the report.

'Federal
 scientists are facing a climate of fear,' says PIPSC president Gary 
Corbett, 'a chill brought on by government policies that serve no one’s 
interests, least of all those of the Canadian public.

'The
 safety of our food, air, water, of hundreds of consumer and industrial 
products, and our environment depends on the ability of federal 
scientists to provide complete, unbiased, timely and accurate 
information to Canadians. Current policies must change to ensure these 
objectives are met.'

Hot debate: Environmentalists are against two tar sands pipelines, which would bring landlocked Alberta's oil to market due to the huge amounts of energy required to extract it. Harper's administration doubled its pro-tar sands advertising budget between 2012 and 2013

According to Inside Climate News, environmental organizations say they have also come in for undue scrutiny from the government.

Seven
 organizations were subject to audits by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)
 this year, just before decisions relating to two tar sands pipelines, 
which would bring landlocked Alberta's oil to market, were being made.

The
 audits are investigating whether the organizations have committed 
abuses which would result in them losing their non-profit status, which 
exempts them from paying taxes.

Canadian law states that no more than 10 per cent of a non-profit's proceeds can be used for political advocacy.

If the CRA determines that they have surpassed their advocacy limit, many of the organizations may be forced to shutter.

'It’s all very scary,' Dr Chris Metcalfe, Director of the Institute for Watershed Science at Trent University told Vocativ.

'It’s 
all about controlling the message. In my estimation the government 
doesn’t want the work of environmentalists running counter to their 
official policies.'

Harper's administration doubled its pro-tar sands advertising budget between 2012 and 2013, reports Newsweek. Mining the controversial oil uses up a fifth as much energy as it produces and is extremely unpopular with environmentalists.
