It was hardly the Spanish Armada, but the Royal Navy and police raced into action yesterday when the Bay of Gibraltar was invaded by fishing and pleasure boats.

Spanish fishermen were protesting over an artificial reef made of concrete blocks dropped on the seabed which, they say, ruins traditional fishing grounds.

The reef is at the centre of the diplomatic row between Britain and Spain which has seen Madrid introduce additional checks at the border in protest, leaving workers and tourists facing queues of up to five hours to get through.

Some 38 Spanish fishing boats and a 
small number of pleasure craft set out from the Campo de Gibraltar 
before being rebuffed by police and military vessels.

Chief
 Inspector Cathal Yeats, of the Royal Gibraltar Police, said: ‘They 
tried to breach the cordon several times but they were not successful.’ 
He said the protest had passed peacefully, with no arrests.

On
 Friday David Cameron raised the extra border checks in a phone call to 
European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso. He underlined 
Britain’s belief that the checks were ‘politically motivated and 
disproportionate’ and therefore contrary to the EU right of free 
movement.

Ch Insp Castle Yates of the Royal Gibraltar Police said the boats met in Spanish waters and, despite efforts by British boats to stop them, crossed into Gibraltan waters before being ‘pushed’ out again.

‘At around 9am about 38 Spanish fishing boats and seven or eight pleasure craft converged in the area of the western anchorage,’ he said.

‘We had our own police cordon along with Royal Navy and other assets and we corralled them in the area of the south mole. They tried to breach the cordon several times but they were not successful.’

The floating protest was also met by Spanish Guardia Civil boats, which warned them not to sail too close to the British territory's reef. The Spaniards, who set out from the Campo de Gibraltar in the country's south, claim the reef restricts their right to fish.

Spain believes Gibraltar's dropping of concrete blocks to the sea floor creating an artificial reef was done to disrupt their fishing fleet. Gibraltar says it was necessary to protect local fish stocks.

A diplomatic spat between Britain and 
Spain erupted when the Spaniards introduced additional checks at the 
border, suggesting that a €50 (£43.30) fee could be imposed on every 
vehicle entering or leaving Gibraltar through its fenced border with 
Spain.

In a telephone call, he underlined Britain's belief that the checks were ‘politically motivated and disproportionate’ and therefore contrary to the EU right of free movement.

Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar's chief minister, thanked the British authorities for their help today.

Mr Picardo, who has reportedly received death threats and been targeted by Spanish internet trolls, said on Twitter: ‘Big thank you also to Royal Navy, Gib Defence Police, HM Customs and Port Authority for their deployment too. Cool, professional and calm.’
