These are the four miners who were killed in the pit tragedy that devastated a community last week.

Pictured together for the first time, David Powell, 50, Charles Breslin, 62, Phillip Hill, 45, and Garry Jenkins, 39, died after a flash flood in the narrow mineshaft.

The investigation into the accident at Gleision colliery in the Swansea Valley  which left four dead is expected to focus on concerns over safety levels inside the colliery.

As police police prepare to probe the mine owner Gerry Ward, 47, it has been reported that he was previously prosecuted for fly-tipping and, in 2002, for passing off low-quality coal as high-quality.

The revelation came as an investigation was launched into a shocking Facebook page that mocked the fate of the four men and families paid tribute to the 'proud miners'.

Police received numerous complaints from members of the public who called for action to get the page taken down and a union official condemned the site as 'thoroughly sick'.

The Facebook site, which took the form of an online hate campaign targeting the Welsh with racial slurs and trivialising the tragic deaths, appeared to be the work of one person.

One comment read: 'In a boost to the failing jobs market in South Wales, 4 new vacancies have been created in the Swansea area from Monday!'

'I hope they catch the people responsible for this as quickly as possible. It is thoroughly sick,' said Ian Morgan, an National Union of Miners official based in the Rhondda Valley.

'Facebook is not the sort of thing I get involved in but whoever is behind this deserves to be arrested and punished in court with the full force of the law.

'I hope they are caught quickly and I urge the police to act with rapidity.'

A spokesman for the South Wales Police
confirmed that a significant number of complaints about the site had 
been received and it was now under investigation.

According to the BBC, Facebook has taken down what it called an offensive page and removed the profiles of its creators.

A Facebook spokesman told the broadcaster: 'Online and off, a tiny minority of people are intent on causing offence to others.

'At Facebook, we have built rigorous 
reporting tools that enable people to report content that makes them 
feel uncomfortable. If content breaches our terms, it will be removed.'

Tributes: Flowers lines the street as local people leave notes for the four dead miners left at Cilybebyll near Pontardawe, south Wales

Grieving: Families of the miners are calling for the pit to be shut down and sealed up for ever once the investigation is complete

Relatives of the miners have today paid tribute to the 'happy and hard-working" family men.

The families told of the most 'harrowing' time of their lives as they waited with 'increasingly dwindling hope' as rescuers battled to reach them.

They said the men were 'proud miners' thanked the rescue teams who risked their own lives in a vain bid to pull them out of the pit.

The most poignant tribute came from Garry's seven-year-old son Alex who said: 'Dad was a great darter and a motorbike rider but most of all he was a great dad.

'I am going to miss him, he will always be loved.'

Garry's family said he was always happy, hard working and never without a smile on his face.  His relatives said: 'He would help anybody he could in any way.

'He lived life to the full enjoying his caravanning and following his family and supporting them in their motocross racing. 

'His other passion was playing darts with his good mates at his local.'

Relatives of Philip Hill revealed it is the third tragedy to hit the family - his son Simon and mother Merle both died within the last 10 months. 

A family spokesman said: 'We wish to thank the Mines Rescue teams who worked tirelessly to bring our Philip home safely but sadly in vain. 

'Their efforts have not gone unnoticed and without their continual hard work throughout the rescue attempt we would not have our Philip home to allow us to grieve.' 

Messages of sorrow: Notes were left on a board at St David's Church in Resolven, South Wales - the home of one of the miners who died

Church services across South Wales paid tribute to Phillip Hill, Garry Jenkins, David Powell, and Charles Breslin. The Archbishop of Wales Dr Barry Morgan said the tragedy had moved an entire nation and the world

The family also thanked the Red Cross, WRVS volunteers and local shops who donated food and supplies during the 36-hour rescue attempt.

Miner Charles Breslin was due to retire but loved the work and comradeship so much he carried on working.

The father and grandfather amazed men half his age by managing to shovel 20 tons of coal a day at the small hillside pit.

His wife Mavis, 60, said in a statement: 'The terrible accident which robbed Charles of his life has left the whole family without a husband, father and brother. 

'The many hours of waiting, with increasingly dwindling hope alongside the families of the other trapped miners were the most harrowing of our lives.

'The dedication and commitment from the emergency services were very much appreciated by all concerned. 

'No one could have done more as they bravely raced against the clock and put their own lives in danger. Their bravery should be rewarded.'

Keen fisherman Charles was Vice Chairman of the Ystalyfera Royal British Legion and had been a member of Territorial Army.

He and Mavis had just completed building their own dream home in the village of Cwmllynfell, four miles from the pit where he died.

Mavis added: 'He never had a bad word to say about anyone. He had been a coal miner for most of his working life, a job which his father had done before him, and had worked at most of the small mines in the area during his life.

'The whole family appreciate the many messages of condolences from people who knew Charles, as well as from many sympathisers who had not known him but had we felt shared in our long vigil during rescue efforts.'

The family of pit maintenance manager David Powell said: 'He was a wonderful husband, father, grandfather, son and true friend. 

'Dai was a proud colliery, our life and soul. He brought joy and fun to everyone he met.'

Father-of-four Mr Powell was very proud that his son Daniel, 26, followed him down the pit. Daniel was one of the three survivors of last week's tragic flash flood at the small private mine.

Meanwhile, investigators entered the 
mineshaft for yesterday as they seek to establish the causes of the 
accident. Police are also preparing to interview the pit owner.

A 
spokesman said the team ‘will draw on technical expertise’, with 
specialist mine inspectors working closely with South Wales Police.Key 
to their investigations will be statements from survivors.

Mr
Powell’s son Daniel, 26, was carrying equipment with Mark Lloyd, 45, a 
short distance away from the point where torrents of water filled the 
narrow tunnels. Both men escaped unharmed.

Mine manager Malcolm Fyfield, 56, who 
crawled out of a narrow ventilation shaft, was still fighting for his 
life in hospital yesterday.

There have been calls for the pit to be shut and sealed once the investigation is complete.

It is thought the men were drilling without knowing that thousands of gallons of trapped rainwater were on the other side of the coal seam.

Prayers were said in church services across Wales at the weekend, while a fund to offer financial support to the grieving families, supported by Prince Charles, has raised more than £50,000.

Among tributes left at St John the Evangelist church in Cilybebyll – the closest village to the scene of the  disaster – was one from Mr Hill’s eldest daughter Kyla, 11. She placed  a bouquet of flowers with a card on which she had written: ‘Hi dad, I love and miss you forever.’

Her mother Donna, Mr Hill’s widow,  left a note which said: ‘Thank you for being part of our lives. Our girls will be safe with me. Miss you always.’

Mr Ward’s firm, MNS Mining Ltd, said in a statement that it was ‘totally devastated about everything that has happened’, adding: ‘Our thoughts are with the families.’
