BBC business editor Robert Peston has launched an appeal on Twitter for the safe return of his late wife's  wedding and engagement rings, which were stolen in a burglary on Wednesday night.

Mr Peston’s wife, the author Sian Busby, died aged 51 in September after losing a five-year battle with lung cancer.

The award-winning journalist appealed for the return of the ‘irreplaceable’ family heirlooms and shared pictures of the rings, which were taken along with other jewellery, two laptops and an iPad from his £1.5million home in North London.

Mr
Peston, 52, said: ‘It’s an incredibly distressing time, especially so 
soon after losing Sian. It’s not about the monetary value, it’s about 
the sentimental value.

‘The rings are irreplaceable and they 
mean a lot to me. They belonged to my grandmother and I gave them to 
Sian when we were married.

‘They were from the 1920s and were Art Deco in style. As well as the 
wedding ring and engagement ring there was also a gold ring, inscribed 
with the words ‘‘my darling’’.

‘Also taken was a gold necklace which said ‘‘mum’’ with a heart on it. 
One of our sons had given it to Sian as a present. All I can do now is 
hope they are returned to me.’

Mr Peston’s Edwardian end of terrace house was broken into while he was out at work.

He revealed the burglary on Twitter, saying: ‘Burgled last night. My 
beloved late wife’s 1920s engagement & wedding rings taken. Naive to
think they might turn up, but . . .’

Police said he may have been targeted because of his high-profile role 
which may have helped criminals learn his movements. He is best known 
for his coverage of the credit crunch.

They added that Mr Peston had told them the laptops may have contained 
sensitive material relating to his work but declined to discuss what it 
was.

Mr Peston also shared this pictured of his late wife's cariad ring. His Edwardian end of terrace house was broken into while he was out at work

A second house in the upmarket area, which has views of Alexandra Palace
and is popular with families, was also targeted on the same evening. 
However police were not prepared to say the burglaries were linked ‘at 
this time’.

Mr Peston took a short leave of absence after his wife died three months
ago. The couple met when they were teenagers as Miss Busby was a school
friend of Mr Peston’s younger sister, Juliet.

They began dating when they were studying at different universities, 
although it was only a brief affair and ended when the former Financial
Times and Sunday Telegraph reporter took a posting in Brussels.

They 
rekindled their relationship  in the mid-1990s after her first marriage 
ended.

Three years ago Miss Busby revealed that they were brought back together
after Mr Peston’s sister was seriously injured in a road accident and 
suffered memory loss.

Robert Peston worked as a journalist on the Financial Times and Sunday Telegraph before he joined the BBC

She said: ‘I started going to see her with photographs to talk about our
school days and help her piece her memory back together.

‘Robert was often there at the same time, but I was feeling so low that I
didn’t think he – so handsome, so successful – could possibly be 
interested in me.’

The couple married in 1998. They had a son, 
Max, who is a teenager, and Miss Busby also had another son, Simon, from her 
first marriage.

She was an acclaimed fiction and non-fiction author whose first novel 
was the historical thriller McNaughten, set during the early Victorian 
era.

It recounts how a zealot tries to assassinate the unpopular prime 
minister, Sir Robert Peel. Her second book, The Cruel Mother, dealt with
issues including infanticide and post-natal depression.

Det Sgt Gordon McKay, of Haringey CID, said he spoke  to Mr Peston shortly after the journalist had discovered the burglary.

He said: ‘He seems okay, but obviously would like the rings back as they are of a personal value to him.’

Sian Busby, 51, who was acclaimed for her fiction and non-fiction, was diagnosed with cancer nearly five years ago. Above, two of her novels
