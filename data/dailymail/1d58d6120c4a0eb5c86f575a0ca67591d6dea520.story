The Statue of Liberty will re-open on the Fourth of July, nearly eight months after the fierce winds and flooding caused damage to the island on which it stands.

When the ferocious hurricane hit late last October, Lady Liberty had only recently reopened following a $30million refurbishment.

But Liberty Island itself was badly damaged, with the floodwaters breaking railings, washing away paving stones, and destroying electrical systems. The statue remained unlit until the second week of November.

Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar, joined by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, announced the re-opening plans today.

'Hurricane Sandy inflicted major 
damage on facilities that support the Statue of Liberty,' Salazar said. 
'Based on the tremendous progress we have made, Lady Liberty will be 
open to the public in time for the July 4th celebration.'

As much as three-fourths of Liberty 
Island's 12 acres was flooded, officials estimated, with water reaching 
as high as eight feet. The rest of New York Harbor was greatly damaged 
as well.

Sandy came one day after the Statue of
Liberty's 126th birthday and the reopening of the crown, which had been
closed for a year for a $30 million upgrade to fire alarms, sprinkler 
systems and exit routes.

Designed by Frederic Bartholdi, the statue is a neo-classical sculpture based on the Roman Goddess of Freedom, Libertas.

She was a present to the US from France to celebrate independence and was erected in 1886 in Upper New York Bay on Liberty Island.

Bartholdi's inspiration for the statue was a comment made by politician Édouard René de Laboulaye in mid-1865.

He stated: 'If a monument should rise in the United States, as a memorial to their independence, I should think it only natural if it were built by united effort - a common work of both our nations.'

She makes for a truly exhilarating sight for anyone entering New York. The main body of the statue stands at 151ft high, but with the pedestal included, reaches 305ft.

According to the Associated Press, 
around 3.7 million people visited the statue in 2011, making it the 19th
most visited national park.

Schumer stressed the importance the statue has on New York’s booming tourism economy.

'Being open for the summer tourism 
season isn't just important symbolically, it's a boon to the city's 
economy and businesses, as the statue attracts millions of tourists from
all over the world to our shores,' he said.

Sandy also inflicted major damage on 
nearby Ellis Island, though officials weren’t clear on when the historic
island would re-open.

The
statue had been closed to the public since 2009 for repairs. The 
renovation included replacing the stairs to the crown, as well as 
creating wheelchair access to one of the observation decks at the top of
the pedestal.

This year marked 
the 126th anniversary of the Statue of Liberty’s dedication and the 
renovation improved fire alarms, sprinkler systems and exit routes to 
bring it in line with city safety codes.

There
are also more stairs than ever before, with a daunting 393 steps to the
crown, where there were previously 354 slightly steeper steps.

The 
famous statue is 151ft from base to torch.

It
sits atop the 89ft tall stone pedestal, which sits on a 65ft 
tall foundation in the shape of a star.

Meanwhile the 
bathrooms have been upgraded for the first time since the 1980s.

In addition a new air-conditioning system will cool the interior of the copper-clad monument, which previously could get up to 20F hotter than outdoors at the height of summer.

About 3.5million people visit Liberty Island each year, although most don't go inside the statue.

With the improvements, 26,000 more will be able to ascend to the crown each year.

The statue, a gift from France to the US, was dedicated in 1886 and declared a national monument in 1924.

In 2009, the crown was reopened to the public for the first time since the 9/11 attacks.

Sandy was blamed for at least 98 
deaths across the U.S. and Canada, leaving New Jersey's barrier islands a 
wasteland of eroded shoreline, ruined beachfront homes and flooded streets.
