A group of Taiwanese farmers has smashed the world record, for planting rice.

The 1,215 competitors in Taoyuan County, Northern Taiwan transplanted an incredible 2.1 hectares of rice in just 16 minutes and 20 seconds.

It beats the old record set in Thailand in 2010 when 904 people transplanted rice in 1.6 hectares in 35 minutes and 35 seconds.
