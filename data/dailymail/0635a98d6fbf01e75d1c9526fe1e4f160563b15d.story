Authorities say an Indiana dog breeder whose minivan broke down in central Ohio was transporting 62 dogs, some four or five to a crate.

Licking County Humane Society Executive Director Lori Carlson says the animals were stacked 'bottom to top' in the van when it was discovered in the parking lot of a hotel in Hebron, east of Columbus, on Saturday afternoon.

Carlson said the dogs, some just a few weeks old, had coats covered with feces and urine.

Cruelty: An Indiana dog breeder whose minivan broke down in Licking County was caught transporting 62 dogs, some just a few weeks old

Cramped conditions: The breeder said he was taking 50 dogs and 12 puppies from Country Boys Pets in Indiana to an animal rescue New Jersey

Humane Agent Paula Evans was the second on the scene Saturday afternoon and said, 'In one kennel alone was a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, a Rottweiler, a Lab and then another large dog.'

The breeder said he was taking 50 dogs and 12 puppies from Country Boys Pets in Indiana to an animal rescue New Jersey.

'By the time we got them into our care, it had almost been 24 hours that they had been in the van,' said Carlson.

The breeder has been named as Country Boys Pets owner Jonas Fisher, who runs a dog breeding facility. He may now be facing some serious charges over how his operation is run.

Rescued: The Licking County Dog Shelter was already filled with dogs, but workers created a makeshift kennel in the multi-purpose room and began feeding and caring for the dogs

Freedom: Many of the dogs slept, some jumped, not used to having all the space to move around and stretch their legs

This isn't the first time Fisher has been reprimanded over his practices.

United States Department of Agriculture documents detail three visits by the USDA over the past three years.

Then, last August agents reported undocumented dogs, discovered that five shipments of puppies were weaned early and shipped too young, and that 47 dogs and puppies were being held in enclosures that were too small.

And now, agents say they found a van load of Country Boys Breeder dogs and puppies in bad shape.

The minivan broke down and was found in the parking lot of a Licking County hotel. According to Carlson, a hotel worker saw the dogs and contacted the sheriff.

Help at hand: Community members have started dropping of donations of small breed dog food and puppy pads to try and change that

Deplorable: Some of the dogs sustained cuts and scratches from being trapped in close quarters with one another. One puppy was sick with pneumonia. Many were covered in feces and urine

Twenty-five of the dogs were taken by a mobile animal rescue crew from New York. The rest went to the Licking County Animal Shelter. There, you could see some of the dogs sustained cuts and scratches from being trapped in close quarters with one another. One puppy was sick with pneumonia.

'Filthy coats.. A lot of feces, covered, urine soaked,' Carlson said.

The Licking County Dog Shelter was already filled with dogs, but workers created a makeshift kennel in the multi-purpose room and began feeding and caring for the dogs.

Many of the dogs slept, some jumped, not used to having all the space to move around and stretch their legs.

The driver reported being hired by the breeder to take the 50 adult dogs and 12 puppies to an animal rescue in New Jersey. They now are in Ohio animal shelters.

The county prosecutor's office will consider charges in the case.

Shocking: For hours, the dogs traveled four to five dogs per crate - some were just a few weeks old

Community members have started dropping of donations of small breed dog food and puppy pads to try and change that. A veterinarian will screen the dogs and give them shots.

Then they will go up on the Licking County Animal Shelter's website for adoption.
