It's a label adored by the Duchess of Cambridge - and the one she wore to announce her engagement to Prince William in 2010.

But with a new creative director taking over the helm at Issa, there was potential for a huge shake-up.

Luckily for Kate - and Issa's army of loyal fans - new creative director Jamie O'Hare stuck to the tried and tested method that has made the brand so popular in royal circles. 

Jamie O'Hare unveiled his debut collection for Issa in London today

Adding his own touch, the trademark jersey dress was given an asymmetric hem and came emblazoned with more interesting prints.

The 70s throwback (which is being championed all over the catwalks) was omnipresent, with coats and dresses coming heavily fringed.

Models stomped down the runway in textured jumpsuits, turtle neck dresses with bold stripes and statement red dresses, which were worn almost exclusively with black boots.

Ultimately, Jamie's play-it-safe debut collection will no doubt please customers (including a certain royal one).

Beauty-wise, Vidal Sassoon Global Ambassador, Duffy, aimed to capture the collections ethos of 'movement' when coiffing models' hair. 

'I was asked to create a curtain of hair that could float, with a strong silhouette that played to the underlying gothic element within the collection,' he told FEMAIL backstage ahead of the show.

'The collection is precisely worked, with an attention to detail and couture-like craftsmanship in the clothes and this inspired the beautiful, "high quality" hair.'

As with the collection, Duffy was aiming for an element of effortlessness with an undertone of attitude. Requiring little more than freshly shampooed and conditioned hair and a salon-quality blow dry, the look is all about simplicity.

Hair was kept flat at the roots and a round brush was used to add body through the lengths and ends to create movement.

The minimal styling gives the hair looseness so that the lengths part as the girl walks. Duffy added: 'The intention was to exaggerate the healthiness and recreate the look of virgin hair - and the result is a strong silhouette of completely clean, heavy, super-shiny hair that amplifies perfection.'

Make-up came courtesy of legendary Val Garland using L’Oreal Paris.

'We are chanelling Donatella,' she told FEMAIL backstage ahead of the show. She etched on a strong graphic eye in matte black, which was 'cool' and 'a bit gothy'.

Lips were pared back in nudey pink, while skin was similarly peachy. 'It's matte, pretty and, above all, wearable,' she said of the final look.

Nails, painted by Marian Newman, were metallic blue and beetle winged because, according to the queen of talons, they're back...and we won't argue with her.
