A far north Queensland woman who miraculously survived 17 days in rugged bushland says she was given the strength to carry on when a voice at an old Aboriginal burial ground told her 'only you can do it.'

Shannon Fraser made headlines when she stumbled naked out of the bush earlier this month after becoming lost at a popular swimming spot in Queensland's far north on September 21. 

She lost 16 kilograms during the ordeal, surviving only on dirty creek water, she was severely burnt from sun exposure and covered in cuts and scratches.

The mother-of-three has opened up about the experience, which she says was 'agony.'

'It was torture,' she told New Idea magazine.

Ms Fraser become lost while visiting Golden Hole, south of Cairns, with her partner and a friend and unknowingly walked further into dense rainforest when she tried to retrace her steps.

As the days wore on she was bitten by relentless march flies, scratched by wait-a-while vines and plagued by thirst and hunger.

The mother, from nearby Innisfail, spent days wading through croc-infested waters and it's understood she sat in the waters for three days to soothe her cuts and burns. 

As she began to weaken, she drew strength from the knowledge her children, aged 15, 11 and nine, were waiting for her at home.

On day 16 - just as she had given up hope - she neared an old Aboriginal burial ground and heard a voice say: 'Only you can do it'.

A short time later she came across ribbons left by searchers which guided her to a spot just 30 metres from where she went missing.

She was treated in hospital for third degree burns and underwent surgery to remove splinters from her feet and legs.

She also suffered insect bites, numerous welts, cuts and bruises. 

Ms Fraser described the moment when she finally got to hold her children as 'like hitting the jackpot'.

Her brother, Dylan Fraser, told the Courier Mail that  his sister looked like 'Biggest Loser meets Bear Grylls' when she emerged from the bushland.

'She's lost lots of weight, she's covered in cuts and scratches, but she's in good spirits,' he said when she was found.

The former cancer patient's 11-year-old daughter Takirah, told the Courier Mail that her former 90kg mother 'looks way skinnier, but she's in a lot of pain', adding that she was ecstatic Ms Fraser was alive. 

Ms Fraser's disappearance sparked a huge search in which emergency crews spent 800 hours scouring the area.

Her incredible tale of survival triggered doubts, with police even saying they were confident the extensive search would have located her and that she had likely travelled outside the search area.

There were suspicions she might have met with foul play, and her mother made a public appeal for information.

Police have said they aren't taking any action against Ms Fraser after speaking to her days after she emerged from the bush.   

Ms Fraser says she heard a voice at an old Aboriginal burial ground on the 16th day, telling her 'only you can do it.' Ms Fraser says the voice gave her the strength to carry on
