Officer: Dayvon Maurice Green, a 23-year-old engineering student worked as a police auxiliary officer at the University of Maryland for about two weeks before shooting his two roommates

The University of Maryland shooter who fatally shot his roommate and seriously shot another before turning the gun on himself previously worked for the campus police its been revealed.

Dayvon Maurice Green, a 23-year-old engineering graduate student, worked as a police auxiliary officer on the College Park campus before being fired, a university police spokesman said on Wednesday.

The student who police say set a series of small fires inside the home to draw his two roommates outside before ambushing them was fired after about two weeks in August and September said spokesman Marc Limansky after twice failing to show up for work.

Green did not carry a badge or a gun while on duty, but had a police radio that would allow him to summon a sworn officer if he spotted trouble.

Early Tuesday morning police say Green fatally shot 22-year-old Stephen Alex Rane from Silver Springs and 22-year-old Neal Oa who survived his injuries. Green then turned the gun on himself.

Green's family told police that he had been suffering from mental illness for at least a year and had been prescribed medication. A law enforcement officer speaking to the Washington Examiner said he suffered schizophrenia.

Killed: Stephen Alex Rane, 22, from Silver Springs (pictured) was shot dead on Tuesday morning while fleeing a fire set by Green to intentionally draw him and Neal Oa outside according to police

Ambush: An unidentified male student, who attends the University of Maryland, is taken to hospital following the murder-suicide at a home close to campus in the early hours on Tuesday

Trap: Green fled the burning home with his two roommates before police say he pulled out a gun and began firing

Police say Green started several fires 
in the basement of the small property and in the yard off campus. The 
flames awoke his two housemates who fled outside, where he opened fire 
on them with a handgun.

Rane was shot where he stood while Oa was hit while running away.

The shooter then went to the backyard of the home where he committed suicide, Prince George's County police said.

Green was armed with an  Uzi submachine gun, a machete, baseball bat and ammunition along with the handgun with which he shot his victims, according to authorities.

Emergency: Fire crews attended the scene close to the college campus as the alleged shooter had set several small fires

Lock-down: The shooting occurred at 1am on Tuesday and emergency crews quickly swarmed the scene

Heavily armed: Green was armed with an Uzi sub-machine gun (stock image) but did not use the weapon police said

An official told the Washington Post that Green could have inflicted far more serious damage with the more high-powered weapon.

Students at the college were informed of the shooting via text message as the campus issued a high alert. Witnesses said that police were on the scene five minutes after the gunshots were heard.

The home is not part of university housing and the street is a mix of college students and families.
