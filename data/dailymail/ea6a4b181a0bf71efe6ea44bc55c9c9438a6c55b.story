Tempers reaches boiling point in a Coppa Italia match between two Serie B sides on Sunday night as Avellino's Gianmario Comi seems to have followed in Luis Suarez's footsteps after being accused of biting Bari striker Giuseppe de Luca.

Footage shows Comi appearing to bite De Luca during the early stages of the second half as Avellino prepared to take a free-kick.

The match official seemed to miss the incident and instead decided to show a red card to De Luca for his furious protests after the incident.

'Bari deserves respect, like all clubs.

'I will continue to work because the public and players have to act in the correct way, no one should think of coming here and doing as they want.
