Google will be forced to reveal who leaked the Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer after Marvel was granted a court order to compel the information.

A federal judge approved the Disney-owned company's request for a far-reaching subpoena against the tech giant two weeks after the video was made public before it's scheduled release date.

Marvel said in court documents that someone using the name 'John Gazelle' posted a file of the film, which stars Robert Downey Jr and Chris Hemsworth, on a Google Drive account.

Google will be forced to reveal who leaked the Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer after Marvel was granted a court order to compel the information

A federal judge approved the Disney-owned company's request for a far-reaching subpoena. Pictured is Ultron, the titular villain in the new movie 

A Disney lawyer sent Google a takedown notice requesting the tech company to remove the file due to breach of copyright.

The subpoena, issued two days ago, said Google has to bring 'all identifying information for the user 'John Gazelle' to court on November 18 in San Francisco.

But Judge Richard Wieking did not grant Marvel's request to 'permit entry onto the designated premises, land, or other property possessed or controlled by you at the time, date, and location set forth.'

Google was told: 'You are commanded to produce at the time, date, and place set forth below the following documents, electronically stored information, or objects, and to permit inspection, copying, testing, or sampling of the material.'

Ironic: The clip begins with Ultron stating, 'I'm gonna show you something beautiful'

A subpoena is a writ issued by a government agency, most often a court, which has the authority to compel testimony by a witness or production of evidence under a penalty for failure.

It is possible that the company is looking for an infringer either inside Marvel or Disney or a production house handling the prized trailer. 

After the leak, Marvel released the official version of the trailer the same day - days ahead of its schedule debut.

The leaked video paints a bleak and eerie picture for the sequel to the hit 2012 Marvel film.

The band of superheroes can be seen looking defeated and on the verge of giving up hope as the world around them goes to chaos.

Bleak: In one scene, Mark Ruffalo (the Hulk), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow), Chris Hemsworth (Thor), and Chris Evans (Captain America) can be seen idling in an aircraft, appearing limp and utterly dejected

In the Joss Whedon directed film which debuts May 2015, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) tries to jump-start a dormant peacekeeping program and things go awry, according to IMDB.

'It is up to The Avengers to stop the villainous Ultron from enacting his terrible plans.'

And this is no easy task, as Ultron, voiced by James Spader, certainly seems to have the upper hand for much of the film.

He narrates the video in an ominous and gravelly voice, relishing the destruction he has caused.
