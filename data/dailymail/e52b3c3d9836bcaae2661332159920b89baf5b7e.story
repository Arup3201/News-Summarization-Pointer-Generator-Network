South Africa started their Rugby Championship campaign with an edgy victory against Argentina in difficult conditions at the Loftus Versfield Stadium.

The Springboks hammered the South Americans by 60 points when they met in the competition last year, but Saturday's affair was a much closer affair as the hosts triumphed by just seven points.

South Africa scrum-half Ruan Pienaar scored the only try, in the second minute of a game played on a drenched pitch in Pretoria.

The home side led 10-3 at the break but conditions in South Africa were so bad that just two penalties were scored after the interval.

Handling errors and testy exchanges dominated the rest of the game as the converted try proved the difference with Handre Pollard and his replacement Morne Steyn both contributing a penalty while Nicolas Sanchez slotted over two of his own for the Pumas.

Argentina had three good chances in the last five minutes to force a possible draw but defeat by seven points ensured some consolation in the form of a bonus point.

South Africa go top of the table with four points, with Australia and New Zealand, who drew in Sydney earlier on Saturday, in second and third with two points. Argentina are bottom of the pile with a single point.

Next week New Zealand face Australia and Argentina play today's opponents South Africa on home soil in Salta.
