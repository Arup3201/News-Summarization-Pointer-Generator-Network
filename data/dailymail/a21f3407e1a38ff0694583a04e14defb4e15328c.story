It is believed that humans discovered fire over a million years ago.

And now a team of Israeli archaeologists have uncovered the site of a large hearth dating to around 300,000 years ago.

The discovery of repeated fire building over a continuous period was made in Qesem Cave, an archaeological site near present-day Rosh Ha'ayin in Israel.

A team of Israeli archaeologists have uncovered the site of a large hearth (pointed out by the blue arrow) where hominins may have tended to fires as early as 300,00 years ago. The discovery of repeated fire building over a continuous period was made in Qesem Cave, Israel

Historians have long questioned when humans began to control fire in order to use heat to suit their daily needs and this find hints that prehistoric humans already had a highly advanced social structures and intellectual capacity.

Excavations in Qesem Cave have been ongoing since 2000 and have been headed up by Professor Avi Gopher and Ran Barkai of Tel Aviv University.

Dr Ruth Shahack-Gross of the Kimmel Centre for Archeological Science at the Weizmann Institute, Israel, collected samples from the site and analysed them in the lab.

Dr Shahack-Gross tested the micro-morphology of the ash by extracting a 'cubic chunk' of sediment from the hearth before hardening it in the lab. She then cut it into thin slices (pictured) that showed burnt bone and rock fragments within the grey ash residue

She identified a thick deposit of wood ash in the centre of the cave and used infrared spectroscopy to find that in the ash were specks of bone and soil that had been heated to very high temperatures – ‘conclusive proof’ of a hearth.

Dr Shahack-Gross and her colleagues tested the micro-morphology of the ash by extracting a ‘cubic chunk’ of sediment from the hearth before hardening it in the lab.

They then cut it into thin slices and examined them under a microscope to determine the exact composition of the materials to reveal how they were formed.

In and around the hearth area the archaeologists also found large numbers of flint tools that they are sure were used for cutting meat, it was reported in the Journal of Archaeological Science.

The graph shows the infrared spectrum of the grey sediments and that the dominant material is calcite - the mineral of which the wood ash is composed.

They believe that differently-shaped flint tools found just a few metres away were used for other activities.

The site also contained large numbers of burnt animal bones, which the experts think is further evidence that cave men used fires to cook meat.

Dr Shahack-Gross and her colleagues said that their findings build upon other evidence that suggests the organisation of various ‘household’ activities into different parts of the cave, points to an organisation of space and a kind of social order that is typical of modern humans.

They think the cave served as a kind of ‘base camp’ that prehistoric humans returned to again and again.

Another recent study revealed that Neanderthals were a house-proud race who liked to return to a comfortable home after a long day of hunting, excavations of caves in Gibraltar (pictured) have revealed

Dr Shahack-Gross said: ‘These findings help us to fix an important turning point in the development of human culture – that in which humans first began to regularly use fire both for cooking meat and as a focal point – a sort of campfire for social gatherings.’

‘They also tell us something about the impressive levels of social and cognitive development of humans living some 300,000 years ago.’

The researchers think that these findings are signs of substantial changes in human behaviour and biology that began with the appearance of new forms of culture and a new human species in the region some 400,000 years ago.

A collapsed rock shelter in north-west Italy revealed that cavemen were tidy. The site (pictured) showed how they arranged their living space, assigning separate areas for preparing food, making tools and socialising, according to a study which was published in December

Archaeologists have recently found that Neanderthals living at different times and in different regions were quite domesticated and house proud.

Scientists from Oxford University and Gibraltar museum found Neanderthals used a network of small caves for occasional hunting expeditions before returning to a larger base, which they called home.

They unearthed stone tools and camp fires featuring the remains of seals, ibex and red deer, dating back more than 24,000 years.

By analysing the artefacts and the density in which they were found in each cave in Gibraltar, a team of scientists was able to determine which site was used for what purpose.

Gibraltar was inhabited by Neanderthals for 100,000 years, with radiocarbon dating suggesting they lived on the Rock possibly as recently as 24,000 years ago

Gorham's Cave, the largest of those excavated by the scientists from Gibraltar Museum and Oxford University, was also once home to hyenas.

Scientists said: 'The paucity of large vertebrate remains from Gorham's Cave has been interpreted to be a consequence of housekeeping, thus implying longer-term occupation.'

In another study, archaeologists discovered that Neanderthals lived in organised and tidy spaces - much in the same way as modern humans.

They found an ancient cave shelter in Riparo Bombrini, Italy, which shows ancient man thoughtfully arranged their living space, assigning separate areas for preparing food, making tools and socialising.

Dr Julien Riel-Salvatore, from the University of Colorado Denver, who led the research, said: 'There has been this idea that Neanderthals did not have an organised use of space, something that has always been attributed to humans.

'But we found that Neanderthals did not just throw their stuff everywhere but in fact were organised and purposeful when it came to domestic space.'

Investigation of three Neanderthal levels at the cave site showed how areas were divided up for different activities.

The top level, containing animal remains, seems to have been reserved for butchering animals.

The middle level was a long-term sleeping area, and the bottom level a place for shorter stays.
