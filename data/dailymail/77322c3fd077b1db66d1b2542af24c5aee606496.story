One school playing field has been sold off every two weeks since the London 2012 Olympics, new figures have revealed.

Ministers have given the nod to 26 sales since pledging to use the games to deliver a sporting legacy for children.

The Coalition promised to ‘seek to protect school playing fields’ when it formed in May 2010.

Official figures show that 57 disposals of school fields have been authorised since 2010, despite promises that this would not happen

But official figures show that 57 have been approved for sale since then - and the pace of sell-offs quickened in the year of the Olympics.

The Government said pitches which had been approved for disposal were often unused or surplus to schools’ requirements.

It said the proceeds of disposals must be reinvested in either sporting or educational facilities.

The Sport and Recreation Alliance, representing more than 300 sporting organisations, said that access to decent facilities was a ‘pre-requisite to tackling the growing crisis of inactivity among young people’.

The figures show that 14 sell-offs were allowed in the first year of the Coalition and 12 between May 2011 and April 2012.

The following year numbers had risen to 19, and in the six months between May 2013 and October 2013 – the latest period for which figures are available – 12 had already been approved.

The sites are often sold onto housing developers.

Despite the pledges, the spectacle and pageantry of the 2012 London Olympics has failed to save school fields around the country

In six cases, the Government over-ruled its own advisory body to force through sales.

As the country celebrated Team GB’s success in the August 2012 Olympics, David Cameron pledged to use the inspiration of the games to ‘get children playing sport more regularly’, particularly competitive sport.

In that year, Education Secretary Michael Gove was forced to apologise after it emerged the number of sell-offs under the Coalition was higher than it had previously admitted.

He was also criticised for rejecting the advice of the School Playing Fields Advisory Panel – a committee of independent experts which is legally bound to make recommendations on each sale application.

A new report outlines disposals since May 2010 and the reasons for each.

In 38 cases, schools closed or merged with others. In seven, the land was leased to other organisations, with pupils able to use it during school hours.

In 12 cases, the land concerned was ‘small sections of playing field…that either isn’t used by the school for sport or is not needed due to other facilities in place’.

The Department for Education said: ‘No open school has disposed of its entire playing field, and in every case all of the money made by the local authority or school from the sale will be invested in local sports or education facilities.

‘Every school must, by law, have access to enough playing field space to allow for its sports and curriculum needs to be met.’

It said the number of disposals was falling. An average of 28 applications per year were approved under the last Labour government, against an average of 16 annually under the Coalition.

Sallie Barker, interim chief executive at the Sport and Recreation Alliance, said it had particular concerns about the potential for land sell-offs at newly-built academies and free schools.

‘There is no room for complacency and access to decent facilities is a pre-requisite to tackling the growing crisis of inactivity among young people.’
