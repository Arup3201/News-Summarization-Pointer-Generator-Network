Pele has undergone surgery to have kidney stones removed after being admitted to hospital in Sao Paulo.

The 74-year-old three-time World Cup winner was forced to cancel an appearance at the Pele Museum in Santos due to 'health reasons' with a statement from the Albert Einstein hospital since released to confirm the reasons behind his admission.

'The Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein informs that patient Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Pele) following admission and that, after conducting tests, the presence of renal, urethral and bladder stones were causing obstruction to urine flow,' the statement read.

'This morning he underwent a surgical procedure for removal of stones and at the moment, is clinically stable and recovering. The Albert Einstein Hospital will provide (a) bulletin so there is new information.'

Pele has previously been under the care of the Albert Einstein hospital having had surgery on his thigh two years ago and it remains unclear how long he will now remain at the centre for observations.
