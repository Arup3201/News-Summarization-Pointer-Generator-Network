An Alaska Airlines flight en route from San Jose to Honolulu today was forced to make an emergency landing in Oakland shortly after takeoff after the crew reported a possible bird strike.

The flight landed without incident at Oakland International Airport around 9 a.m. Wednesday. No one was injured, officials said.

Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Marianne Lindsey said the pilot reported feeling something ingested into an engine and landed as a precaution.

The plane likely hit a bird, but Lindsey said crews were still inspecting the plane in the afternoon and had not yet confirmed a bird strike.

Lindsey said there were 157 passengers and six crew members on board. They were transferred to another plane that left for Hawaii at 10 a.m this morning.
