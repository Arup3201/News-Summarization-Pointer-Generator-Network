A woman who was told she had just 24 hours to live has defied the odds and returned home to her family.

Kathy Taylor, of Bear River, Utah, had been diagnosed in July with an aggressive form of melanoma that had spread throughout her body.

At the time, she was 26 weeks pregnant with her sixth child.

Home again: Kathy Taylor (center with her children and husband) returned home on September 25, two weeks after doctors told her she had just 24 hours to live

Baby boy: Taylor (above with son Luke) had an aggressive form of melanoma that had spread throughout her body, but was determined to not receive treatment and carry her unborn child as long as possible

And even though the young mother could not receive treatment while pregnant, she waited as long as possible to give birth, sacrificing her life for the life of her unborn child's in the process.

Ultimately, she was forced to deliver her baby prematurely, giving birth while not long after her diagnosis - at 26 weeks pregnant - due to her failing liver.

Her son Luke was born on September 11, weighing just 1 pound, 15 ounces. 

Shortly after she delivered her baby boy, her husband and five other children were brought in to say their goodbyes, as doctors said Taylor had 24 to 36 hours to live.

'I felt really peaceful,' Taylor said. 

'I thought, "I’ve lived a really good life, a very full life. I got to be with my kids a lot." I felt like I was going to die.'

The hours somehow turned into days however, and on September 25, she was told she could go home.

Emotional month: After giving birth on September 11, Taylor's condition began to slowly improve

Sad ending: Tragically, her newborn son Luke (above) passed away due to an intestinal infection on September 27

Tragically, Luke passed away on September 27 of complications from an intestinal infection.

Taylor had been diagnosed with melanoma seven years ago, and had it removed, not knowing it had returned until this summer.

'I would try to take a breath and it was like something was stabbing me,' she told KSL.

After giving birth, Taylor's one wish was to be able to hold on long enough so that she could hold her son, something she was able to do on September 25, just two days before his death. 

On her Miracle FundMe page, set up to help pay for Luke's treatments after his birth, she wrote, 'I really believe that it was literally the thousands of prayers spoken that I am still here.

I have been touched so deeply by the amazing outpouring of love from many of whom I have never met. I have seen such a profoundly deep and touching side of humanity that I will never forget. Thank you.'

Making the most: Taylor (with her husband on left and Luke on right) has now been given a year to live

Doctors have now given Taylor a year to live, and she is determined to make the most of it.

Or, defy the odds yet again.

'I’ll try to do everything in my power to stay, but I know it’s not in my hands, and I’m okay with that,' she said.

'Coming home and seeing how much my family loves having me here and needing me here, it just makes it harder to leave.'
