The latest version of Google’s Android operating system, dubbed ‘Android L’, has been revealed.

In a video, the new software is shown running on a Samsung Galaxy S5 and it highlights some of the system's new features including lock-screen notifications and non-invasive alerts.

No official release date for Android L - rumoured to stand for Lollipop but also possibly Layer Cake - has been announced yet, but it is expected to be unveiled later this month.

California-based Google's next operating system has been previewed in a video that shows a leaked version of the software. The software is shown running on the Galaxy S5 using Samsung's TouchWiz. Android L stops alerts such as phone calls from taking up the whole screen

The test build version of Android L was revealed by SamMobile. In the video, the site explores the app and shows off some of its various functionality.

Each phone operator has their own slightly tweaked version of Android - with Samsung’s being called TouchWiz - but this video still reveals some of the features users can look forward to.

Google has announced its next-generation Android software will prevent law enforcement officers and governments getting their hands on user information.

Only people with passwords or passcodes for devices running Android L will be able to access the files on it.

This means that if search warrants are served on Google for the customer's information, it won't legally be able to get hold of it.

Google began adding encryption tools to devices in 2011 and it was a standard feature of Android Jelly Bean. However, the tool was optional and many users either didn’t know how to enable the feature, or weren’t aware it existed.

Any devices that upgrade to Android L next month will have this tool turned on by default.

For starters, Samsung has done away with the blue background it previously used on its phones, instead now preferring white backgrounds.

This seems slightly odd as lighter backgrounds use more power and thus drain more battery than darker ones - something Android L is attempting to improve, reports Pocket-Lint.

Pulling down with two fingers on the screen now opens up a menu of shortcuts, and holding one will take you to that settings menu - such as the Wi-Fi screen.

And as mentioned earlier, the lock screen now displays notifications such as messages and missed calls - but at the expense of widgets on previous versions of Android. 

Google has also redesigned the look of the operating system, which it calls Material Design.

This includes a new look for Dialler, Messages, Memo, Clock and more.

And another interesting new feature is heads-up notifications, which means that alerts no longer take up the whole screen.

Known as Android L - which may stand for Lollipop or even Layer Cake - the software is the successor to KitKat used on current phones like the Samsung Galaxy S5 (shown). Google is rumoured to be gearing up to release Android L later this month

So, for example, if you’re playing a game and someone calls you, or your clock alarm goes off, an alert will appear at the top of the screen rather than covering the playing area.

The clipboard has also been updated, and now keeps a history of saved screenshots and copied text.

MirrorLink support for cars has also been brought in as well, allowing users to mirror the screen of their device on their car’s display.

SamMobile add that the test version is still in its alpha stage, so it doesn’t run entirely smoothly, and there are a number of glitches to iron out before it's released.
