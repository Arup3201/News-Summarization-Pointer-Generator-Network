A Boston man remains in the hospital after  he fell naked through the ceiling of a women's bathroom at Logan Airport and then assaulted an elderly man.

Prosecutors said Monday that 26-year-old Cameron Shenk is still at Massachusetts General Hospital, and they are unsure when he will be arraigned.

Shenk faces charges including attempted murder, assault and battery on a person over 60, and lewd and lascivious conduct.

Authorities say he had apparently sneaked into the bathroom, undressed inside a stall and climbed into the ceiling crawl space. He was injured in the fall.

Cameron Shenk, 26, who sneaked into the women's bathroom at Boston's Logan Airport before climbing into a ceiling space naked, is still being treated in Massachusetts General Hospital, according to prosecutors 

Investigators say the man fled the bathroom and assaulted an 84-year-old man he encountered. 

He then crashed through the ceiling, suffering cuts to his head and body, and attacked an elderly man while he was still naked and bleeding, leaving the pensioner with serious injuries, it is claimed. 

'Once outside the restroom, for reasons still under investigation, Shenk assaulted and seriously injured an 84-year-old man,' Massachusetts State Police said in an online statement.

'That victim was later transported to a local area hospital with various injuries that are not expected to be life threatening.'

The alleged rampage on Saturday came on the same day that a 52-year-old male driver was arrested near the airport's (pictured, its interior) Terminal B after allegedly assaulting a 21-year-old female passenger

Shenk, whose motive remains unknown, then allegedly struggled with troopers who arrested him, injuring one of them. 

The alleged rampage came on the same day that a 52-year-old male driver was arrested near the airport's Terminal B after allegedly assaulting a 21-year-old female passenger. 

Anton Hilton, from Roxbury, was detained by police after a bystander heard the alleged victim screaming from inside the car, which was sporting a broken windshield.
