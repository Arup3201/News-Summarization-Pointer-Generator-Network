A terrified 20-year-old woman narrowly escaped death by tearing off her seatbelt and rolling on to her side as a lorry toppled over on to her car.

These dramatic pictures show just how close she came to being crushed inside the Nissan Micra when it was flattened on the A50 in Staffordshire.

The shocked young woman saw the lorry trailer begin to fall and managed to roll into the foetal position.

Cheating death: The 20-year-old woman on just managed to roll into the foetal position before the heavy lorry fell on top of the Nissan Micra

Bravery and intelligence: The young woman was left with only a hand injury after her lightning-fast reactions

Her quick reactions saved her life as her grey Nissan was completely crushed - its underside left touching the floor with the red lorry trailer resting on top of it.

She then bravely clambered out of the car through the passenger side, escaping with just a hand injury.

Clambering to safety: Emergency services paid tribute to the woman's presence of mind after the dramatic accident occurred at 8.30am

The dramatic incident happened today at 8.30am in Uttoxeter.

A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'The incident happened just after a roundabout. The lorry was in the outside lane on the dual carriageway, with the Nissan Micra in the inside lane.

'The lorry was pulling a trailer which toppled over onto the car pushing the roof down into the passenger compartment.

'The 20-year-old woman in the car told ambulance staff that she realised what was happening and managed to get her seatbelt off and roll onto her side in a foetal position.

'By the time the rapid response vehicle arrived she had managed to scramble out of the car via the passenger side.

'Given the level of damage to the car, had she not had the presence of mind to act the way that she did, the level of injury would certainly have been serious if not worse.

'It is fair to say that her quick thinking probably saved her life.

'The woman suffered a hand injury. After being assessed at the scene, she was taken to the specialist hand injury clinic at Royal Derby Hospital.

'The man driving the lorry was uninjured but understandably shaken by the incident.'
