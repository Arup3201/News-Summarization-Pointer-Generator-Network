Astronomers have spotted glimmers of 'Galaxy X' – a giant, almost invisible galaxy lurking just outside our own.

The mysterious galaxy is made up mostly of dark matter and has previously only been detectable by its large gravitational pull.

Now, a cluster of young, pulsating stars discovered at the far side of the Milky Way have marked the location the dwarf galaxy, which is hidden behind clouds of dust.

Learning more about Galaxy X could be a major step in verifying our understanding of how the universe began from primordial matter, as well as the Big Bang.

Existing theories correctly predict the distribution of distant galaxies. But the same theory also predicts hundreds of dwarf galaxies around the Milky Way. Up until now, only only a few dozen have been found. Galaxy X could help uncover even more.  

A team, led by Sukanya Chakrabarti from Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, looked at four young stars 300,000 light years away.

These young stars are Cepheid variables–'standard candles' that astronomers use to measure distances.

According to Professor Chakrabarti, these are the most distant Cepheid variables found close to the plane of the Milky Way.

The stars appear to be associated with a dwarf galaxy the team predicted in 2009 based on her analysis of ripples in the Milky Way's outer disk.

Radiation from the Cepheid variable stars allowed the team to find out accurate distances and test an earlier prediction of its location.

'These young stars are likely the signature of this predicted galaxy,' said Professor Chakrabarti.

'They can't be part of our galaxy because the disk of the Milky Way terminates at 48,000 light years.'

Scientists had previously predicted that despite largely being made up of dark matter, Galaxy X should have a sprinkling of dim stars.

But finding these had proved difficult as the dark matter galaxy lies in the same plane as the Milky Way disk.

'The discovery of the Cepheid variables shows that our method of finding the location of dark-matter dominated dwarf galaxies works,' she said.

'It may help us ultimately understand what dark matter is made up of.

Invisible particles known as dark matter make up 23 per cent of the mass of the universe.

The mysterious matter represents a problem in astronomy because it is not understood.

'[The study] shows that Newton's theory of gravity can be used out to the farthest reaches of a galaxy, and that there is no need to modify our theory of gravity,' Professor Chakrabarti added.

Learning more about Galaxy X could be a major step in verifying our understanding of how the universe began from primordial matter, as well as current understanding about the Big Bang, the researchers claim.
