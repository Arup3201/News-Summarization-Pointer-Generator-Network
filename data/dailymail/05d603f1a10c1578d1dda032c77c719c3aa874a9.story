Asda has removed a 'rogue online offer' after customers discovered they could get a £50 discount on anything over £50.

In a 'system glitch', hundreds of shoppers were able to buy luxury items such as electrical equipment, crates of alcohol, chocolate and DVDs for as little as 1p.

All they had to worry about was the cost of delivery.

However, hours later Asda bosses got wind of the blunder and texted the bargain-hunters to say their orders had been cancelled.

Blunder: The supermarket giant texted customers to say their orders had been cancelled after hundreds discovered they could buy £50 items for 1p. A spokesman said they will not honour the 'rogue' offer

It comes just weeks after the store was attacked for offering 'mental patient' Halloween costumes to their online shoppers.

Today, the groceries giant faced criticism by announcing it will not honour the deal promoted last night.

A spokesman said: 'We're aware of a glitch with our e-vouchering, and are in the process of addressing it.

'No-one has lost out as a result of it, but a small number of savvy customers have taken advantage and got more money off than they should have.

'We’ve removed the glitch which has prevented customers from using the rogue voucher and we apologise for any confusion caused.

'We will not be honouring any outstanding orders which have used a rogue voucher code.'

Customers took to social media after the seeming act of generosity was revoked.

One Twitter user said: 'PLEASE HONOUR MY ASDA DEAL. THINK OF IT AS CHARITY'

Another tweeted: 'So depressed I didn't get this ASDA deal'

Splashing out: People were able to spend their cash on bubbly and DVDs as well as the everyday essentials

Others called BBC Radio 4 to complain.

Nick Devine, 23, from Leeds, told the You & Yours programme he was sent the code by a friend.

He said: 'I bought two-and-a-half litres of vodka and three bottles of mixer, checked out and it came to zero.

'I said I'd pick it up from Asda so I didn't have to pay the delivery costs, but I've woken up to a text message this morning to say it's been cancelled.'

Before this morning's bombshell announcement, some generous shoppers were even tweeting the code for others to share.

One man posted a picture of his computer screen showing a £6.05 total on an online shop worth £56.05, saying: '£50 off Asda delivery, no minimum spend. Offer ends 01/01/14. You get 4 uses. Code RM 10 1M 05 #cheers'

As the news spread, people were desperate not to lose out.

One woman tweeted: 'Panic buying in the office for the £50 off #Asda deal. FAR too much pressure.'

Another said: 'Obviously lots of people have had the same idea as me with this asda deal, website keeps crashing arhh'

One successful shopper exclaimed: 'Taking advantage of asda deals. £50 of booze for 4.50! #yaaasssss'

Undeterred by the backlash, Asda has announced that it reserves 'the right to withdraw or cancel any of its e-vouchers at any time'.
