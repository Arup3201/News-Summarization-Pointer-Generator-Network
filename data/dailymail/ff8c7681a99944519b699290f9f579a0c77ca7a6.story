Damages claim: Bus driver Robert Young outside his home yesterday

A ‘chronically obese’ bus driver is suing his bosses for £75,000 after injuring his back when his chair collapsed during a tea-break.

Robert Young claimed to have suffered ‘whiplash-style’ injuries when the combined table and chair unit ‘shot backwards’, throwing him and a colleague on to the concrete floor.

The driver launched a legal action against Lothian Buses, claiming the incident had left him feeling suicidal.

The 54-year-old also claimed to have suffered chronic back pain after the incident, requiring painkilling steroid injections and physiotherapy.

But lawyers for Lothian Buses rubbished Mr Young’s allegations.

They claimed he was already suffering from back pain before the fall and disputed that the injuries necessitated his long absences from work.

They said he already had a poor attendance record before the incident.

The accident happened at a Lothian Buses depot canteen on May 6, 2010. After his fall, Mr Young did not work for two months.

He returned on July 19, 2010 but only stayed for four days, taking sick leave from July 23 until October 4.

The driver, from Prestonpans, East Lothian, then ‘worked normally without reporting difficulties and built up to full shifts’.

Lothian Buses’ lawyers claimed Mr Young had other health issues that were not related to the supposed injuries suffered from the fall.

They said he was ‘chronically obese and a non-insulin dependent diabetic’.

In court documents, Mr Young’s legal representatives claimed that the fall had left him with psychological problems.

They said he now suffered from ‘occasional suicidal ideation’, depression, low moods and difficulty with concentrating.

As well as the whiplash-style spinal injury, the lawyers said he suffered soft tissue damage to his left elbow and right thigh.

Mr Young confirmed the case was ‘on-going’ yesterday but refused to comment on the details of his compensation claim.

Ian Craig, managing director of Lothian Buses, said: ‘It is our policy not to comment on legal matters.’

It is unclear if Mr Young is still employed by Lothian Buses.

Lothian Buses is the largest provider of bus services in Edinburgh. The company is the only publicly owned transport operator in Scotland, the City of Edinburgh Council being the main shareholder.

It employs more than 1,000 people and has a fleet of almost 650 buses – including 30 that provide open-top tours of Edinburgh.

Mr Young’s compensation case is one of a number of claims launched against the bus operator recently.

George
Fyall, 62, fractured his finger and injured his foot when a bus driver 
‘slammed on the brakes’ and threw him to the floor as he was leaving the
bus on the North Bridge in Edinburgh on November 19, 2010.

Mr Fyall, of Kirkcaldy in Fife, subsequently launched a claim for negligence, seeking £50,000 in damages.

His lawyers said he was on the top deck and, as he walked to the front of the bus to climb down the stairs, the driver, William Brown, braked suddenly, throwing Mr Fyall to the floor.

Lothian Buses has admitted liability.

In November last year, the bus company was forced to pay compensation to a Chinese university student who broke her pelvis, arm and collarbone after being hit by a bus while cycling.

Dongmin Yan sued for £500,000 after spending six months in hospital due to the severity of her injuries.

The 38-year-old University of Edinburgh student, who now lives in Gorgie, was hit by the bus at Crewe Toll roundabout.

Firemen had to free her after she was dragged underneath the bus and her lungs collapsed.

Lothian Buses settled for an undisclosed fee.
