A fare-dodging Lithuanian tourist sparked a £1million stand-off and disrupted 40,000 train passengers after he climbed on to a railway station roof, a court heard.

Mantas Badauskas, 25, triggered the seven-hour confrontation with police as he tried to dodge a fare in Ipswich, Suffolk, last Friday (July 19).

His actions caused massive disruption for commuters and hit thousands of music fans heading to the Latitude festival in nearby Southwold.

Mantas Badauskas refused to come down from the roof - even pulling up the ladder that police tried to set up at Ipswich train station

Badauskas was trying to return to Lithuania after a week in England but had lost all his belongings, Ipswich magistrates heard.

The tourist tried to use an Oyster Card, a London travel pass, at Ipswich train station, believing the town was part of the capital.

But when station staff told him he must pay for his ticket to Stansted Airport, in Essex, he tried to clamber over a roof in a bid to bypass the ticket barriers.

Badauskas then set off a chain of events which led to the rail lines being shut down and scores of services cancelled.

The incident, which began at just after 8am last Friday, led to 79 trains to be delayed or cancelled.

About 750 furious passengers were trapped in three trains without power or air conditioning while they waited for the tourist to climb down

Tess Mann, prosecuting, said that Badauskas was seen on the canopy above Platform One, which was packed with passengers waiting for trains.

Police were called but he warned cops that he'd jump if they went near him.

Bare-chested Badauskas stayed up on the roof for nearly seven hours in the hot sun, repeatedly refusing all requests to get down.

Mrs Mann said that a ladder was put up at 9.15am for him to go down but he pulled it up on to the roof as police, firefighters and paramedics went to the scene.

Police feared that the glass and asbestos canopy was not strong enough to support Badauskas' weight.

The tourist was also close to 25,000 volt power cables, which had to be switched off.

Badauskas hurled bolts at police negotiators, but was finally brought down at around 3.10pm

About 750 furious passengers were trapped in three trains without power or air conditioning on a baking hot day as a result, the court heard.

Badauskas hurled bolts at police negotiators, but brought the drawn-out incident to an end when he got down at 3.10pm.

He was taken to hospital to be treated for the effects of dehydration.

Mrs Mann said Greater Anglia reckoned 40,000 passengers were stranded at stations during the face-off.

Badauskas told police he just wanted to reach Stansted Airport to fly home to Lithuania.

The tourist is now set to be sentenced at Ipswich Crown Court after he admitted obstruction without intent

Mrs Mann said: 'He thought he could get the train to Stansted by going on the canopy.

'When he realised he couldn't, the police had already seen him.

'He was frightened to go back down because he was scared of being arrested.'

The cost of the face-off - in terms of lost production and compensation claims to rail operator Greater Anglia - is estimated to have topped £1 million.

Badauskas is now set to be sentenced at Ipswich Crown Court after he admitted obstruction without intent.

Badauskas could be jailed for up to two years.

Magistrates committed the case to crown court and remanded him in custody.
