As a designer who's famed for her lady-like glamour and pared down pieces it came as quite a shock to see shrimp emblazoned kimonos making an appearance on Temperley's SS15 catwalk.

Attended by a host of celebrity fans including Nicole Scherzinger, Pixie Lott and Anna Friel, Alice Temperley's latest collection presented something of a turnaround from her traditional presentations.

The 39-year-old British designer called her newest line an 'evolution at Temperley London' as the range sees the high-end design merge with Alice's diffusion line Alice by Temperley.

Alice Temperley showcased a relaxed collection of silk Kimonos and flat trainers with Japanese influence including this silk coat which featured a large prawn motif on the back

The result was a collection of effortless silhouettes featuring billowing Kimonos, lose suit pants and forgiving waistcoats.

The models floated down the catwalk with perfect ease as Alice presented something that is rarely seen on the catwalk but always well received, flat shoes. 

The line saw a plethora of lose fitting fabrics that Alice hopes will transfer from day to night

As well as her bold new colour scheme Alice presented her typical wash of summer pastels

The lace up plimsolls decorated with this season's key prints from the collection gave the collection a younger a more relaxed feel and made the collection even more appealing as the models seemed more relaxed than ever.

The bold colour palette featuring tomato oranges and sky blues was inspired by Japanese Shunga Ink paintings which showed in the boxy silk jackets lose fitting jackets.

Embroided coral and graphic rope design gave the collection a mermaid vibe 

The use of flat shoes on the runway gave the models effortlessly relaxed walks

The line also saw a nod to Alice's more traditional colour combination of pastel pinks and baby blues adding the Temperley's typical feminine charm.

The evening wear took on a mermaid like feel with fishnet and graphic rope and encrusted with crystal sea creatures.

Alice believes her latest collection combines the brand's signature style with a modernist twist.

'(It is) a collection that is wearable with a strong contemporary edge.'

Alice Temperley bought her son out with her to thank the crowd 

A collection that was inspired by the radiant colours of Japanese artwork would surely call for equally bold shades of makeup. Well at least that would be the obvious option.

However, Lisa Eldridge make-up artist to the stars says that the relaxed line needed to be met with equally relaxed beauty.

'The collection features lots of flat tennis shoes' says the 39-year-old beautician 'We wanted the make-up to compliment that.

Pared down beauty was the make-up look for Temperley SS15

'It would make no sense to have the girls walk down the runway in red lips and heavy make up.' 

The result is bare faced beauty that is actually extremely achievable and requires most attention on building up a healthy complexion.

'The beauty is very much skin based' says Lisa, adding 'We wanted to create sport glossy skin that looks effortless.'

To create the look Lisa Eldridge used nothing more than tinted moisturiser and super balm 

When describing how to get the look Lisa explains that using a balm can help achieve the glossy look the girls had on the runway.

'We have just used tinted moisturiser and a super balm on the lips eyelids and eye brows.'

The eyebrows continued the trend for bigger is better with Lisa brushing them up to create more volume. Other than a high lighting pencil and a eyelash curlers that was the extent of the makeup for Temperley and yet the models appeared glowing. 

'It's fresh and sporty and has a strong natural feel' added Lisa.

So we can all breath a sigh relief in the knowledge that the no make-up look is hot this season.

You might not know her name now but you will soon. Ashley William's SS15 collection made a rip roaring debut in the Topshop show space yesterday.

The hotly anticipated collection comes from the British based designer who was previously a member of Fashion East. 

Her SS15 inspiration comes from  reworking references from throughout the 20th Century and combining them seamlessly into modern fabrics and silhouettes.

Ashley Williams displayed Coca-cola motifs for her SS15 collection to represent breaking down the barriers between East and West

This season Ashley has focused particularly on the sixties and the Age of Aquarius as Western influences flowed into Asia.

The collection features motifs of Coca-cola as a way of demonstrating the unification of east and west as Coca-cola is an internationally known brand.

Nostalgic silhouettes and shapes from the past become bound by restyled Asian braiding in rubber, based on traditional handmade silk fastenings, and the duality of East and West are drawn together in playful, girly multi-layered tea dresses with oversized collars. 

The beauty looks at the show had an oriental influence

The SS15 show saw a star studded front row including (from left to right) Laura Bailey Alexa Chung, Daisy Lowe, Pixie Geldof and Thomas Cohen 

Jacquard knits, bra-lets and oversized retro graphic prints flirt with social stereotypes of the day. Asian elephants and rainforest monkey signature bags are complemented with fancy appliqué leather handbags. 

As well as her debut solo collection Ashley has had an extremely busy season. Tipped to be the next big thing the much sought after designer has also worked on several collaborations this season.

 

Ashley also worked alongside LG to produce a garment care bag 

The up and coming design was invited to work with LG electronics to design a garment carrier following the news that British adults ruin nine items of clothing in just 12 months. 

With the launch of the bespoke Ashley Williams for LG Garment Carrier that will be available to buy in September, LG hopes to encourage Brits to take more consideration when caring for their couture and promote the value of investing in and maintaining a future-proof wardrobe, over the trend for throw-away fashion. 

As well as working with LG Ashley Williams has launched her debut footwear line in collaboration with cult British brand Red or Dead marking its return to London Fashion Week after a decade - a five piece capsule range titled Making Movies, featuring monochrome sling back kitten heels and transparent vinyl court shoes set for launch in February 2015.
