Stanislas Wawrinka continued the defence of his Australian Open title with a comfortable third-round victory against Jarkko Nieminen on Saturday.

Fourh seed Wawrinka, who won his maiden Grand Slam crown here at Melbourne Park last year, was too strong for world No 72 Jarkko Nieminen as the Swiss won 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 to progress to the last 16.

While his compatriot Roger Federer crashed out the tournament on Friday, Wawrinka has progressed through the draw with relative ease, winning nine of nine sets played so far.

Wawrinka said: 'I'm really happy with my game so far. I think today was a good match. It's been three really good matches. I think my game is there and I'm really happy to get through again.'

The first set was tight with Nieminen staying with his higher-ranked opponent all the way until the pivotal moment when Wawrinka broke Nieminen's serve for the opening set with a forehand winner.

Wawrinka was by far the more aggressive player - the total winners count ending 53-18 in his favour - and that raw power helped him ease to a two-set lead.

Breaks were exchanged in the third set but with Nieminen serving to stay in the match, Wawrinka brought up three match points and he only needed one as the 33-year-old Finn was caught in no man's land in the middle of the court and netted with the forehand.
