A pizza chain in New Zealand has sparked an online row after nailing hundreds of rabbit pelts to a billboard to advertise its new Easter Pizza.

To raise awareness of the smoked wild rabbit-topped dish, Hell Pizza covered billboards throughout the country in the animal skins with the tagline: 'Made from   real rabbit. Like this billboard.'

Inevitably, online commentators took to social media sites to either vent their anger or defend the chain.

Controversy: Hell Pizza covered billboards throughout the country in the animal skins with the tagline: 'Made from real rabbit. Like this billboard' to promote their new pizza

On The company's Facebook page, Sophie Gao, posted: 'A new low, definitely won't be supporting your business again.

'This billboard is not doing your   business any favours - pure idiocy.'

Conner Bond added: 'I will never support your business again. I'll make sure my friends don't either.'

New Zealand Vegetarian Society, which has endorsed some of the chain's meals, also joined in, saying: 'While we've been pleased to have Hell's   vegetarian and vegan pizzas NZ Vegetarian Society Approved, impressed at their efforts to ensure avoidance of cross-contamination and can appreciate   Hell's humour, this is deplorable on so many levels.

'While we "approve" Hell's veg pizzas, we do NOT approve of this.'

Some of the angry reactions from Twitter to the advertising stunt

However, Siang Tay defended the PR stunt, posting: 'Lots of comments about the shocking use of the rabbit pelts.

'How arrogant it is to display these cute   bunny skins for the whole world to see... But what about your nice leather shoes? Or your pretty leather bag? How about that luxurious leather sofa?'

Sandra Russ said: 'Loved Hell's pizza before. Love them even more. This is AWESOME!!! Well done!! Very creative and hilarious. Will definitely be trying   a rabbit pizza. Mmmmm!!'

To address the furore, Hell Pizza posted a statement defending the pizza on their Facebook page.

It said: 'As well as being a delicious meat, and even   quite cute, rabbits are unfortunately also a noted pest that is damaging to the New Zealand environment, particularly in the South Island.

'For those who are concerned, we sourced these rabbit skins via a professional animal tanning company, who in turn sourced them from local meat   processing companies where the skins are a regular by-product.

'Our Rabbit Pizzas are made purely from wild rabbits from Southland and Otago.'

Hell Pizza's gourmet special pie is topped smoked wild rabbit, toasted pine nuts, beetroot and horopito relish, cream cheese, rosemary and fresh spring   onions.

Hell was established in 1996 and now has branches in the UK, Korea, Canada and India. In 2006 it was sold to the franchise that owns Burger King.
