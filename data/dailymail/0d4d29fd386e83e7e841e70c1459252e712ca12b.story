BP has asked the Government to help it battle a wave of ‘fictitious’ claims for billions in compensation over the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

The oil giant says lawyers are encouraging Gulf Coast businesses to make spurious claims just to earn a commission.

BP has set aside £28billion to cover the cost of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion on April 20, 2010, which killed 11 workers and spilled an estimated 4million barrels of oil into the sea.

Disaster: The explosion at the Deepwater Horizon rig, pictured, which killed 11 workers and spilled an estimated 4million barrels of oil into the sea, has led to billions in payouts from BP

It initially earmarked £5.2billion to compensate local businesses who were hit in the pocket, but it now expects the total to be much higher.

There are fears the final compensation bill could even put the company’s future at risk.

A surge in claims has been aided by US lawyers seeking out claimants to make a commission, oil industry sources believe.

BP also argues that the administrator of the claims, Louisiana lawyer Patrick Juneau, has been far too generous to businesses.

Earlier this year, BP asked the judge to impose a temporary freeze on compensation demands.

SOS: Reports have claimed that BP is seeking the help of David Cameron to avoid a slew of compensation claims which, it is feared, could put the future of the entire company at risk

It offered examples of firms that have lodged claims despite  being based miles away from affected areas.

In
one, a North Alabama construction company received £6.38million after 
putting in claims for lost income – despite not doing any work in the 
region.

The company also disagrees with the methodology used to calculate how much businesses have lost.

The oil giant told the judge that it could be ‘irreparably harmed’ by such ‘fictitious’ and ‘absurd’ claims.

Appeal: But David Cameron did not raise the issue of BP's troubles during his recent meeting with Barack Obama. An industry insider said it was unlikely the government could achieve much lobbying the White House

BP
declined to comment yesterday, while a spokesman for Number 10 said 
only that the Prime Minister had held no conversations with the company.

But Whitehall officials are believed to have held informal talks with BP executives.

One industry insider said it was unlikely that the government could achieve much by lobbying the White House on BP’s behalf.

‘There’s not a lot that even Obama can do to intervene in the U.S. legal process,’ he said.

The huge cost of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill has already left BP a shadow of its former self.

It has sold off £25billion of assets to help pay for the clean-up of the Gulf and to cover compensation claims.

The
firm also lost its chief executive, as Slough-born Tony Hayward was 
forced out after making a series of high-profile gaffes that enraged 
Americans.

He told reporters
‘I would like my life back’, prompting fury from those affected by the 
spill, and was later spotted enjoying himself at a yacht race around the
Isle of Wight.

BP’s efforts
to win government backing come at an unfortunate time, after it was 
named alongside Shell in a European Commission probe into oil price 
fixing.

David Cameron said 
he was ‘hugely concerned’ by the probe, which will examine allegations 
that oil traders manipulated petrol prices, driving up prices at the 
pump for millions of motorists.
