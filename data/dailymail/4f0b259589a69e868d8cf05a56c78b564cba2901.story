A woman who was caught on CCTV stealing Poppy collection tins from hotels with two brothers has been spared jail.

Amy Sanders, 22, was seen on security cameras snatching the red appeal boxes from a Holiday Inn in Oldbury, near West Bromwich, West Midlands.

Sanders was spotted with Adam and Karl Tookey entering the hotel at 12.30pm on November 6 last year before they grabbed the charity box from the front desk and fled.

No shame: Amy Sanders, 22, who could not even show respect to the court by dressing smartly, escaped jail after pleading guilty to counts of theft. She was seen on CCTV distracting hotel staff so her two accomplice brothers, one her boyfriend, could steal the poppy charity boxes from hotel lobbies

Hours later, they stole a second collection tin from the Britannia Hotel in Birmingham city centre.

Sanders's boyfriend Karl Tookey, 25, and his brother Adam, 22, were jailed for 12 months last Armistice Day after they admitted the thefts.

Yesterday at Wolverhampton Crown Court Sanders was spared jail despite admitting two thefts.

Recorder
 Anthony Potter said: ‘Most right thinking members of society would 
contrast what you have contributed to society, which sadly seems very 
little, with what the Royal British Legion has done. 

‘It is a pretty stark contrast.’

Sanders, of Nottingham, was given a 
26-week sentence suspended for two years, ordered to carry out 120 hours
 unpaid work and given an 18-month supervision order.

Shameless: thieving brothers Karl (left) and Adam Tookey were jailed for a year on November 11, 2013 for stealing poppy collection tins from two Midlands hotels. At their trial Anthony Potter, the recorder, said that they had contributed nothing to society

Theft: The Holiday Inn Express in Oldbury, West Midlands, where on November 6, 2103 Amy Sanders with Adam and Karl Tookey entered the hotel at 12.30pm and grabbed the charity box from the front desk and fled

The
 court heard Sanders distracted hotel staff while the Tookey brothers 
swiped the collection tins just days before Armistice Day last year.

Prosecutor
 Mark Rees said: ‘She and the two others took it upon themselves to go 
into two hotels in the knowledge that the charity collection boxes would
 have been fairly full.’

The trio were caught just hours after police issued an appeal for information on social media.

The
 Tookeys were jailed when they appeared at Warley Magistrates' Court, a 
hearing which had to be delayed to allow JPs and staff to acknowledge 
the Two-Minute Silence.

Sentencing
 them, David Payne, the chairman of the bench, said: ‘It was part of an 
organised group crime. Your previous convictions are awful. These were 
planned offences on a vulnerable charity.’
