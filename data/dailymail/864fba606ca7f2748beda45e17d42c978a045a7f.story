We're used to seeing pictures of the First World War in faded brown sepia - dull, muddy, black-and-white photographs that seem to epitomise the drab khaki landscape of shell-blasted sludge that was the trenches in which they were taken.

But, 100 years on, the wonders of 21st-century technology now allow us to see these amazing pictures of the conflict in breathtaking full colour, giving us a much keener sense of what it was actually like to be there.

British photo technician Frank Augrandjean travelled back in time to colour this selection of images from the Imperial War Museum's archive – specially selected to bring home the full horror of the conflict – exclusively for Weekend magazine.

Bloodbath and mudbath Seven stretcher bearers struggle to carry a wounded man to safety in Flanders during the battle of Passchendaele in 1917. Prolonged shelling destroyed drainage ditches and turned the area around the shattered town of Ypres into a quicksand of impassable sucking mud that would bog down wounded men and drown them

Still only 19, Frank started to colour old black-and-white pictures purely as a hobby three years ago. 'People would send me old photos of relatives and I would add colour and send them back,' he says.

'The more photos I did, the better I got at it. I guess that – as with most things in life – practice makes perfect.'

Working entirely digitally, Frank takes extraordinary pains to achieve exactly the right results. Once the original photograph has been scanned into his computer, he starts with a base layer of colour for each object in the scene.

'Then the fine details are added on top, such as grains in wood or skin tones, buttons or intricate patterns in clothing.'

Pigeon post: Pigeons were often used to carry messages from the front line when radio, Morse code and human runners had failed. Here an officer (far right) writes a message as the pigeon's handler, having removed the bird from its cage, holds it upside down to attach the note

Giddy up: Dismounted cavalrymen take a  rest in a convenient shellhole while their mounts form a protective ring around them. Horses proved  ineffective in trench warfare, and by the war's end they had effectively been replaced by tanks

To do this, Frank magnifies the image to the point where individual pixels can be distinguished, then colours them in with a fine stylus from the huge range of shades available in the palette of his Photoshop software.

It can take up to two days of focused concentration to finally bring a photo to life. 'How long it takes depends on the complexity of elements in the original photo,' he says.

'How detailed it is, and how large the image is in terms of resolution. Of course, the object is to make the photo look as if it was taken with a colour camera.

Highway to hell: Soldiers gingerly make their way across a path made of wooden duckboards in Chateau Wood near Ypres, Flanders, during the battle of Passchendaele in 1917. Shelling has reduced the wood's trees to gaunt skeletons

There are so many things that have to come together for that to happen: the colour of different areas of the sky, for example, the reflections on anything shiny or wet, the tiniest details such as the blush in a soldier's cheek on a cold day, and the warming colours on a hot one. It takes a lot of patience to get everything to work together, but when it does it looks great.'

Since it's impossible to retrieve any sense of original colour from a black-and-white photo alone, the only way for Frank to accurately recreate the true colour of any object on an image is to find a colour photo of the same object – or to research it.

Sleeping it off: Tommies snatch a few minutes' shuteye during a well-deserved break from  front-line duty, watched by  men waiting to take their place. Soldiers could spend days in the forward trenches with barely a  wink of sleep

Up and at 'em! British soldiers  go into action, but the man in the foreground  has fallen before even leaving  the trench. Note the reinforced concrete bunkers in the background which have already suffered heavy artillery pounding

Iron monsters: Developed in secret by the Admiralty under Winston Churchill, tanks, or 'landships' as they were originally known, first saw action on the Somme in September  1916. This one, named  Iron Duke, is clanking through the city of Arras to spearhead the British offensive there in April 1917. They were hellishly hot for their crews and liable to break down, but tanks helped end the deadlock  of the trenches in 1918

Survivors: Soldiers of the original British Expeditionary Force return from the bloody battle of Loos in September 1915. Loos was the last in  a series of failed British attacks that effectively destroyed the BEF and led to the firing of its commander, Sir John French, and the hiring of his successor, Sir Douglas Haig, who kept the job for the rest of the war despite being accused of senselessly sending millions of men to their deaths

Doomed? One of the most iconic images of the war shows soldiers of the Royal Irish Rifles waiting to join the offensive on the Somme on 1 July, 1916. There were 60,000 British casualties that day - almost 20,000 died. The battle continued until mid-November, but  no other day produced  such appalling losses

Since, for example, many uniforms from the war still survive it was simple enough for Frank to reproduce their exact shades.

'But if I can't source an original object I can often find a replica on the internet. I've even found items on eBay.' Some things, however, are simply left to the artist's instinct and Frank admits that 'there will always be an element of artistic licence in colourisation, but accuracy will always be striven for'.

Because we're used to the blazing colours of modern photography, these pictures may look muted to us. But, says Frank, that perfectly suits the faded look of old photographs.

'Usually old black-and-white photos will have faded, so the colours need to be toned down to match.'

But however muted the colours, the raw horror of war leaps out of these images for us all to see.

Entente Cordiale: A Tommy befriends two French children in June 1916. Such images of the Franco-British alliance in action were useful propaganda but belied often edgy relations between soldiers and local civilians, who were accused of overcharging their defenders. The soldier belongs to the 15th Battalion, the London Regiment (Civil Service Rifles), a unit raised from civil servant volunteers in the capital

Horsebox to hell: British troops pose in a railway carriage  en route to the front in 1916. A sign on the sliding door on the right proclaims 'Hommes' and 'Chevaux': the men often had to share their transport with horses

Before disaster struck: Women workers stack live shells destined for the trenches at the huge munitions factory at Chilwell in Nottinghamshire in 1917. A few months later, on 1 July, 1918, 250 workers were killed when eight tons of TNT explosive at the factory blew up. Only 32 bodies could be positively identified

Girl power: As the war went on, more and more men left for the trenches. The gaps in the labour market were increasingly filled by women - like these female navvies pushing barrows of rubble - carrying out tasks previously only thought suitable for men
