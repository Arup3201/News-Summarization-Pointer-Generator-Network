But when a trouble-maker tried to put the silver cowboy off his act by tickling his ribs and putting a soggy finger in his ear, no amount of patience could keep him still... so he punched him in the face.

The incredible reaction was caught on camera on Cavill Avenue shopping street in Australia's Surfers' Paradise today.
