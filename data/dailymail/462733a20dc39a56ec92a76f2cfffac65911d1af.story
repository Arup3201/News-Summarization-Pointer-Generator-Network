Jimmy Savile's Highland home, where he once entertained Prince Charles, is being sold off later this month with a £100,000 price tag.

The whitewashed cottage in Glencoe will go under the hammer at auction in Glasgow.

Proceeds from the sale will be added to the disgraced presenter's estate to help pay compensation to his hundreds of sex-abuse victims.

Jimmy Savile's Glencoe cottage will be auctioned this month with a price tag of £100,000. It has been targeted by vandals for a second time

Glasgow-based property firm Ross Harper Property Auctions confirmed that Savile's Allt-Na-Reigh home is included in their auction at Glasgow's Grand Central Hotel on May 30, with a guide price of £100,000.

The sale comes as vandals once again targeted the home - smashing windows and writing 'Glen Savile' across the front wall in red paint.

It is the second time in months that the serial paedophile's Scottish home has been attacked.

A spokesman at Ross Harper said: 'Obviously there has been a lot of interest in this property and it is included in our list for auction at the end of the month with a guide price of £100,000.

'Full details of the property will be available shortly.'

The future of Allt-Na-Reigh has split the local community since the Jim'll Fix It star was unmasked as Britain's worst serial sex offender.

Some have suggested the remote cottage - previously owned by mountaineering legend Hamish MacInnes - should be demolished while others are campaigning to have it preserved as a museum or climbing refuge.

Trustees NatWest Bank has frozen Savile's £4.3million estate and any money raised from the sale will be added to the estate.

Compensation claims are unlikely to be contested by Savile's estate because of the mountain of damning evidence against the disgraced presenter and could be concluded within a year.

Solicitor Alan Collins, whose Manchester-based firm Pannone is representing more than 40 Savile victims, said: 'If the estate chooses to fight the claims - which is unlikely given the evidence - then compensation claims could take years.

'If they chose to get things resolved then we are probably looking at less than a year.'

Savile's secluded Highland bolthole was attacked by vandals in November who sprayed 'Jimmy The Beast' graffiti messages over the walls.

The fresh attack last week came after the walls had been repainted ahead of a planned sale.

Protective wooden covers had been forced off one window which was smashed - sending glass across the main lounge of Savile's former home.

Hamish MacInnes, 82, founder of the Glencoe Mountain Rescue Team said he would like to see his former home turned into a place for climbers visiting the area to stay.

Outdoors expert Cameron McNeish has called for the house to be turned into a museum in tribute to MacInnes, who designed the MacInnes stretcher that is used in rescues worldwide.

But many locals have backed plans to have the building bulldozed to wipe away the memory of Savile in one of Scotland's most popular tourist areas.

Savile had bunk beds and a double bed put into the cottage that he bought in 1998.

He famously had Prince Charles around for dinner in 1999 and hired three waitresses in aprons with HRH sewn into them.

Savile maintained it was his dream to live in the Highlands and he spent huge sums converting the home, adding glass walls, mains water and sewage as well as modernising its decor throughout.

The broadcaster bought the Glencoe house in 1998 after falling in love with it on a cycling holiday in 1944.

Operation Yewtree - the high profile investigation into sex allegations against a string of celebrities - discovered 450 Savile victims but officers fear hundreds more are still too scared to speak out.

Detectives revealed in January how they had recorded 214 alleged sex offences committed by the BBC presenter who died in October 2011 aged 84.

The Top of The Pops host's sickening catalogue of abuse spanned decades and he is even accused of preying on a dying child at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Detectives are still unsure whether any offences happened in Glencoe but said it remained an important part of their investigation.
