With her inner circle rumoured to be concerned over her actions, Rihanna has been looking decidedly down cast in recent days.

The singer, 23, was pictured out in London today looking far less glamorous than usual in jeans, Timberland boots and a baggy jumper.

She hid behind dark sunglasses as she made her way into a building clutching what appeared to be scripts.

It has been reported that the singer's friends are concerned about her reconnection with ex Chris Brown.

Sources close to the ex-couple told website TMZ: 'Rihanna and Chris are dangerously close to getting back together.'

Sources claim Rihanna is still head 
over heels for Chris - in spite of that night three years ago when she 
was brutally beaten by the singer.

Similarly it's claimed Chris - who is in a relationship with Karrueche TranÂ  - also has extremely strong feelings for Rihanna.

But both Rihanna and Chris' friends are said to be 'terrified' they'll 
get back together - and are doing everything they can to prevent a 
possible reunion. Both camps believe it is a terrible idea both personally AND professionally.

But
with both Chris and Rihanna's duets released this week friends fear 
they're fighting an uphill battle. One source said: 'You can't hold back
love.'

One close friend of Rihanna's particularly concerned by the developing relationship is her mentor Jay-Z.

The rapper was said to be 'deeply disappointed' when he found out, according to RadarOnline.com.

The website quotes a source saying: 'Chris is absolutely dead to Jay, he wants nothing to do with him ever. Now that Rihanna is hooking up with Chris and recording songs with him, Jay is deeply disappointed in her actions. He can't fathom why Rihanna is doing the things she is doing.

'He understands the need for forgiveness, but he is adamant that Rihanna shouldn't forget what Chris did to her.'

Since touching down in the U.K last week, the 24-year-old has been partying hard.

After wrapping up her BRIT Awards celebrations at around 4am last night, most would prefer a night in.

But the Barbadian star stepped out after a string of nights out partying, but this time it appeared that her late nights were taking a toll.

She covered her no doubt tired eyes with some black sunglasses and could barely raise a smile as she entered the eatery.

Rihanna
had just made her way from Topshop where she had spent a whopping five 
hours privately shopping in the popular high street store.

And despite earlier tweeting that she was freezing in the English capital, she stepped out in a pair of tiny Daisy Dukes.

The singer did however manage to shield her pins from the cold by slipping on some woolen tights underneath.

She paired the look with a black turtleneck top, a grey blazer and some gold sandals, and swept her blonde hair up in a bun and wore lashings of red lipstick.

Earlier today the Umbrella star had complained about the chilly London weather.

'London is cold AS F**K!!!!!!!!' she wrote on her Twitter account.

Last
night Rihanna partied until the wee hours after giving an astonishing 
performance of her smash hit We Found Love after winning the award for 
International Female artist at the BRIT Awards.

She slipped into a dazzling neon dress and sunglasses to attend an afterparty at London nightclub Mahiki.

The singer completed her look with patent blue heels and opaque black ankle stockings.

The star had a red mark on her neck which looked rather like a love bite - but might equally have been a smudge of lipstick.

Rihanna pulled out all the stops during the show, donning a plunging sequin number for the red carpet.

The star, who was on the tail end of a three-day party in London after celebrating her 24th birthday, showed off some serious skin as she posed for photographers on the red carpet.

Her gold dress had a halterneck-style which finished at her navel, and a thigh-high split showing off her enviable legs.

Later in the evening, she donned a curly wig to give an energetic performance of We Found Love after winning International Female Solo Artist, wearing just a long-sleeved top, exposing her underwear underneath.

She sang in a clear box which contained dancers splashing paint around, and later emerged with green paint on her outfit.

The star beat off competition from Beyonce, Bjork, Feist and Lady Gaga for her International Female Artist gong.

On Saturday night the Barbadian star stepped out with Chloe Green to celebrate her 24th birthday, again at Nozomi.

She looked typically striking, lurking beneath her sunglasses despite it being nightfall and sporting long gold feline talons.

Tore up the stage: Rihanna's performance was an indisputable triumph

Rihanna kept evey inch of flesh under wraps, but still looked effortlessly sexy and feminine in her black trouser suit and white fur coat.

The singer looked rather fresh-faced considering having to rehearse for the BRITs after a big night on the town.

The singer turned up to practice with the hangover from hell after kicking off her birthday celebrations early the night before.
