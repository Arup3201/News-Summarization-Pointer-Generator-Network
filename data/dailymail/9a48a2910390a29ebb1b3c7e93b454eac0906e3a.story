A British artist has created a series of incredibly lifelike images using the contents of his tool box.

With only a hammer and nails to hand, David Foster, 52, has conjured up beautiful images of nature as well as portraits of icons including The Beatles and The Queen.

The artist, who works from his home studio in Warrington, Cheshire, uses up to 30,000 nails in each piece.

The artwork, which can each take up to three weeks of careful hammering to complete, sell for between £2,000 and £4,000 in galleries across the UK.

David says: 'The whole process thrills me, taking just a hammer and a box of nails and arranging them into a piece of art.

'My work is based initially on a photograph, which I painstakingly reproduce. It is very tactile art and the viewer will find it hard not to touch the work.'

David’s ability to create his intricate artwork stemmed from a 20-year career in architecture, where he was required to produce precise drawings for each project.

After falling ill and suffering a prolapse disc problem and nerve damage in the lower back, David was forced to retire.

Due to risk of paralysis, surgeons chose not to operate, and although David has partially recovered, he still suffers from muscle wastage in his left leg and back pain.

David says, 'When I was well enough to draw again I realised that at my age, 49 at the time, I would have to do something different to get noticed in the art world.'

'My technique has evolved and developed over time, I now use tiny nails which enable the viewer to see and interpret the work more closely and in detail.

'I currently have over half a million nails in my studio waiting to be hammered.

'My first piece of nail art was the elephant, titled ‘Elephant on a Bed of Nails’. My first inkling that it worked was when I was half way through it and we had a chap round fixing our boiler.

'He was a distance away from it and thought I was doing a charcoal sketch! He was amazed as he got closer and saw it was made from nails.'

To help create an impact, David creates his artwork on a large scale - usually 1-metre high.

Due to growing publicity via the internet, David’s artwork has achieved sales in USA, Belgium and Pakistan, as well as the UK.

David says, 'I am currently busy working on two new Marilyn Monroe pieces for an exhibition in London later this month.

'My portrait of the Queen from a 1961 Cecil Beaton photo, which I had permission from the Royal Collection to create, will be in the London exhibition.'

David’s artwork will be on display at the Graham Fine Art Gallery in London from the beginning of September.
