Orchidée is the latest buzzword when it comes to colour

Remember the term 'Normcore'? We reported on it a couple of weeks ago - the bland fashion uniform consisting of plain
tees, comfortable shoes, understated anoraks and dad jeans?

Just got your fuzzy fashion head around that? Well sorry to break it to you, but it's already old news in the fast-paced and fickle world of fashion, where buzzwords come and go quicker than you can say Cara Delevingne.

From Haçienda charm and HEAD, to sliders and arm party, FEMAIL has compiled a guide to SS14's fashion jargon so you don't get caught out.

FigureHEAD: Footballer Cristiano Ronaldo has been cited as a key example of someone who is a HEAD - that's a 'high earner, awful dresser' - and a new fashion term to drop this season

HEAD is one of fashion writer Ellie Pither's SS14 lexicons, as cited on the Telegraph, but what on earth does it mean? It simply stands for 'high earner, awful dresser', she explains.

She cites Cristiano Ronaldo as the King of HEAD, and we think Simon Cowell, Ashton Kutcher and Peter Crouch fit the bill, too. 

Then there's Haçienda (a Spanish word for estate) charm, which alludes to the Madchester years in the Eighties/Nineties, when the Haçienda, situated in Manchester, was the world's biggest nightclub - but don't expect to see any white gloves.

'The term will evoke floppy wide-brimmed hats, bejewelled earrings and chic little raffia clutches, rather than acid rave and/or house music,' Ellie writes.

Oh dear: Sorry, Simon Cowell, left, and Ashton Kutcher, right, you are both HEADs (high earner, awful dresser)

Hacienda charm: Penelope Cruz is the obvious Spanish-ista, but look to Sofia Vergara, left, for that tall, Spanish elegance that oozes sex appeal this season, avoid going over the top a la Kate Upton, right, though

'Expect to see a lot more of this term as we approach June, and the Brazilian World Cup - fashion likes to be culturally sensitive, after all,' she writes. 

'It's all about Spanish chic,' adds fashion writer Simon Glazin. 'Think sexy, hourglass shapes, fishtail dresses, which evoke all the charm of a Flamenco dancer and jangly jewellery that lets people know you are arriving five minutes before they see your face.

'Penelope Cruz is the obvious Spanish-ista, but look to Sofia Vergara for that tall, Spanish elegance that oozes sex appeal.'

As well as taking inspiration from the stylish Spanish set, we are also going to be looking further afield to South America.

On-trend: Victoria Beckham, left, has been championing the Gaucho trend lately, while Burberry introduced orchid at the SS14 show, right

Gaucho, which involves emulating the cowboy style of the 19th century, is wide-leg cropped trousers paired with tailored shirts and coats.

Phoebe Philo at Celine, as well as Marc Jacobs and Louis Vuitton, were the first to set the trend, which has been championed by the likes of Victoria Beckham.

Rita joins the party: 'Arm party' refers to your ability to mix and match jewellery, like Rita Ora

If you hear the term ‘arm party’, it means you're well-accessorised and have the ability to mix and match your bracelets, watches and rings to perfection. Really want to nail the look? Stacked rings - a la Rita Ora - and layered necklaces will do the trick.

While 2013 was all about the pastel pink, Orchidée is the latest buzzword when it comes to colour.

Every year, Pantone selects the 
colour trend for the next 12 months and 2014 welcomed orchid - the only 
hue to embrace this season.

Too afraid to go all-out? Incorporate the 
shade into your beauty regime instead by opting for orchid nails and, if 
you're feeling more daring, lips.

Then there's the 'blanket' - and no, we aren't referring to the itchy kind you use for a picnic.

Burberry boss Christopher Bailey was the first to champion THAT 
blanket coat this season.

Bailey sent out all his models wearing wool blanket 
ponchos, knitted in muted yellows, reds and blues, patterned in a sort 
of Bauhaus Mondrian-inspired geometric way, or with Apache-style zig 
zags.

Each one was monogrammed with the 
initials of the model who wore it (indeed, front-row fodder Cat Deeley, 
who named it as her favourite piece from the show, had her eye on Cara 
Delevingne's).

There were blanket coats, too, and equestrian blanket scarves, which are perfect for the chilly but bright English summers.

Blankets go couture: Christopher Bailey sent out all his models wearing wool blanket ponchos at Burberry this season - and we will all be wrapping up like Cara Delevingne, pictured front

If she's doing it, we're all doing it! Rita Ora, who is always one step ahead of the trends, is already rocking the pool sliders look and has even upped the style ante by pairing hers with sporty striped socks

Bruce Willis was spotted on the streets of LA in a pair of sturdy sandals and grey socks this week

As
 for seasonal footwear staples, if you thought it couldn't possibly get 
worse than vibrant coloured Crocs and chunky Birkenstocks, you're in 
for a nasty shock because there’s a new contender for the ugliest shoe in fashion this season. Say hello to the slider.

Flat

 and clumpy with an air of the orthopaedic sandal about them, pool 
sliders are going to be your summer footwear staple, whether you like it
 or not.

British 
fashion 
designer Phoebe Philo sent them down the catwalk at her Paris SS14 show 
for the luxury label Celine and voila, she hot-footed the fash-pack's 
favourite trend.

As we kick off our New 
Balance and Air Max, which have been a winter footwear saviour, quirky 
pool sliders are slowly but surely saturating the high street. 

Two of a kind: Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen took the trend one step further when they wore matching sandals and socks at New York's JFK airport in March

Hot footing a new trend: Celine genius Phoebe 
Philo was the first to send out the quirky footwear at her SS14 show in 
Paris and now they're coming to a high street near you

Known as the 'sad-dad' look, socks and sandals are making a stylish return, FEMAIL reported yesterday, with celebrities such as Bruce Willis, Rita Ora and the Olsen sisters championing the trend.

So
 which style will you be slipping on? Nike slides have a padded strap 
and look chic in monochrome, while Adidas are a cult-classic, and are 
best worn in navy and white.

Looking for something more 
high-end? Celine or Gucci are your first port of call and if you're 
looking to channel the latest trend on the cheap, head to high street 
Mecca Topshop or Asos, who sell them for under £20.

If
 you're still struggling to get your head around the style, there's 
worse news; they are best worn with socks and the sportier the better 
(think Nike striped numbers).

A more pared-back look can be achieved by teaming the sliders with ripped, up-turned jeans and a statement T-shirt.

Which style will you be sporting this summer? 
The die-hard fashion fans will be embracing classic styles like the 
Adidas adilette Slides, £19 (left), while those looking to try the style
 in a more subtle way will love Topshop Unique's metallic pool sliders, 
£55

Cheap fashion: The best thing about the style is that they're reasonably cheap - these ASOS Feodore Slidersare £18, and these classic Nike Benassi Swoosh Slides are £16

Fashion
 writer Simon Glazin said: 'Once thought of as the footwear choice for 
Brits abroad (avec awful sports socks), pool sliders are here to stay. 
For a while at least.

'It was Christopher Kane in his SS12 collection that took them from hideous to high-end, decorating them
 with shiny crystals. Fashion editors rejoiced: "Yesss, no more heels 
for us", and as much as I recoiled at the sight of flats stomping down a
 catwalk, there’s no denying their trend status now.

'Celine’s
 furry-lined options are rather amazing, although you wouldn’t want 
chlorine-filled water splashing over them. Givenchy offer up their take 
on these flats with buckles and prints, and it was Miuccia Prada who 
sent down her catwalk possibly the ugliest-yet-most-fabulous sandals for
 this current season, bejewelled, raised and strappy.

'But
 this is the woman who famously said: “Ugly is attractive, ugly is 
exciting.” Should we be excited by these glorified flip-flops? I’ll 
leave it up to you, lovely reader.'
