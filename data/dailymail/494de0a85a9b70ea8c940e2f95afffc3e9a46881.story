An angelic new picture has been released of Nehemiah Griego, the 15-year-old pastor's son who allegedly gunned down his parents and three younger siblings in Albuquerque, New Mexico on Saturday.

Wearing a smart suit and pulling a slight smile for the camera, the undated photograph has been released amid claims Griego was a military obsessed loner who enjoyed playing violent video games like Modern Warfare and Grand Theft Auto.

'The suspect was involved heavily in games, violent games- and was quite excited as he got the opportunity to discuss them with our investigators,' sheriff Dan Houston said at a Tuesday press conference about the shooting.

This undated photo provided by  shows Nehemiah Griego who is charged with killing five family members, including his father, mother, and three youngest siblings in Albuquerque, New Mexico on Saturday

Local residents of the teenager described a lonesome boy who was always wearing camouflage fatigues and admited to police he had been plagued by suicidal and homicidal thoughts.

Neighbours said they would often see Griego by himself and he appears on an online dating site called, www.meetone.com wearing military garb.

His profile states, 'I'm a fun-loving guy who likes to make peope happy; I might be shy but I'll open up once you get to know me.'

Investigators revealed that 15-year-old Nehemiah Griego said that he killed his relatives because 'he was frustrated with his mother.'

The boy told police that he was feeling homicidal and suicidal at the time of the early morning attack on Saturday and he initially planned to drive to a local Walmart and kill more people.

He also reportedly considered killing the parents of his 12-year-old girlfriend, though no further details about the confession, and they are continuing to piece together the timeline of events.

Sheriff's department spokesman Aaron Williamson told MailOnline that they are still unsure of what the boy was doing between the hours of 5am- when he reportedly killed his father- to 8pm on Saturday when he drove to their local Calvary Church and told one of the churchgoers. That person then called the police.

Mr Williamson said that the investigation is still ongoing but there are no active searches for any other suspects.

He confirmed that all of the weapons- both the .22-calibre rifle and AR-15 military assault rifle that were used to kill the relatives, and the two additional shotguns that Nehemiah had on him when he drove to the church- were all legally owned by his father, former pastor Gregory Griegos.

Once taken into custody sometime after 9.15pm on Saturday, Nehemiah told police the gruesome story of how he killed his mother with a .22-caliber rifle because he was 'annoyed with' his mother, and then went on to shoot dead his three younger siblings before taking an AR-15 assault rifle and waiting for hours until his father arrived home so that he could kill him too.

Nehemiah Griego is in police custody and the formal statement of probable cause tells how, after reciting several false versions of events, he eventually admitted to killing five of his family members.

Lieutenant Sid Covington described Nehemiah as having a 'very stern demeanor, very unemotional' throughout the interrogation.

Religious: The boy's father, a former pastor, was thought to be working at a local mission at the time that his wife and three children were killed, and only returned home at around 5am when his son then allegedly shot him

The 15-year-old said that at just after midnight on Saturday he walked into his parent's bedroom where his mother and younger brother were sleeping and took the rifle from his parent's closet.

He then shot his mother Sara in the head, and when his 9-year-old brother Zephania awoke and said that he did not believe that she was dead, the police report states that Nehemiah 'picked up his mother's head to show his brother her bloody face.'

When Zephania began to cry, Nehemiah shot him dead too before proceeding into the room where his 5-year-old sister Jael and 2-year-old sister Angelina were sleeping.

'Nehemiah stated he lost his sense of
 conscience and went to the bedroom his two younger sisters share. 
Nehemiah stated when he entered he noticed that his sisters were crying 
and he shot both of them in the head,' the police report says.

Suspected shooter: Nehemiah Griego, 15, was said to regularly wear military camouflage gear around the neighborhood

'Quiet': Nehemiah was not registered with the school district so he was thought to be home schooled

Mr Williamson said that the working theory is that Mr Griego, 51, worked at one of the local missions, which potentially explains why he was not at home when his son allegedly started firing at around midnight.

After allegedly killing his siblings and his mother, he then went back to his parent's closet and grabbed the AR-15 military-style assault rifle that they kept there and then went to wait fro his dad in the downstairs bathroom.

When his father arrived at around 5am on Saturday, he waited until his dad had walked past the bathroom so that he was able to shoot him multiple times with the assault rifle.

Nehemiah admitted to police that at the time of the shooting he was having homicidal and suicidal thoughts.

In a chilling note, he added that there would have been more deaths, telling police that 'after killing five of his family members he reloaded the weapons so that he could drive to a populated area to murder more people.'

He said that he expected that he would be killed in a firefight that would likely ensue when he tried to kill others.

The timeline of events from that point on appears a little less defined as he admitted to texting a picture of his dead mother to his girlfriend.

Tragedy: One of the victims of the shooting was identified as Gregory Griego, pictured center, a former pastor at the Calvary Albuquerque church

Killing: Five people were shot to death at the home in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in the Saturday night shooting

In an earlier story, he told police that he had come home to find his family had been killed, and that he drove to the church with rifles in the trunk of the van in order to protect himself from the potential attacker. In that story, he told his girlfriend about the deaths, and then her grandmother then reported it to the authorities.

Nehemiah was arrested after the shooting at his family's Albuquerque home where police found the bodies and they have charged him with two counts of murder, and three counts of child abuse 
resulting in death, according to the station.

Each of the victims were shot multiple 
times, and police found a number of weapons in the house.

Nehemiah is believed to be the seventh of Pastor Griego's ten children and because he has no existing records with the county school board, they believe he was home schooled.

A neighbor told local news station KRQE that Nehemiah quiet but courteous.

Location: The bodies were found at a home on Long Lane Southwest in South Valley, New Mexico

'He seemed to be a normal kid just walking up and down the road,' said neighbor Jerry Crites.

'He seemed to be a very good kid, he was fairly quiet not real rowdy that we could tell.'

One of the only places that Nehemiah 
left a trail is online where he lied about his age to make a dating 
profile on a site called MeetOne.

'Well I'm a fun loving guy who like 
[sic] to make people happy I might be shy but I'll open up once you get 
to know me,' he wrote on the site.

He wrote that he was 18-years-old, most likely to comply with the site's terms and conditions, and posted a photo of himself in his favorite camouflage fatigues.

Family murder: The shooting took place inside the Griego home, and Nehemiah waited there for hours after killing his mother and siblings until his father arrived home from work

House of guns: The boy allegedly used his father's .22 rifle and an AR-15 semiautomatic rifle to shoot his family

Crime scene: Authorities investigate the death of Pastor Gregory Griego and family members at his home on Sunday morning

'There's no other way to say it, except 
that we have a horrific crime scene down there that we are working on,' 
Sheriff Dan Houston said on Sunday.

'Right
 now we're to the meticulous points of processing the scene and 
collecting physical evidence, and this is a vast scene with a lot of 
physical evidence,' sheriff's department spokesman Sid Covington said.

Though little is known about Nehemiah, his father was a recognizable figure in the community and previously served as the pastor at Calvary Albuquerque Church.

After spending six years working at the Calvary Chapel in Montebllo, California, Mr Griego moved to New Mexico. Since moving to Albuquerque, he has worked in a number of different outreach capacities for the Christian church, including leading the prison outreach program and leading the group Veterans for Christ.
