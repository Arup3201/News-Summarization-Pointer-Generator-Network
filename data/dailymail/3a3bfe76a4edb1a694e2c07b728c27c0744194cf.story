This is the moment a couple returning from a relaxing week-long honeymoon came home to discover their house had been covered in 14,000 post-it notes.  

Jamie and Emily Pharro had enjoyed a week in Lake Garda, Italy, after getting married in front of close friends and family on August 1. 

The trusting pair had left a set of keys with friends who were meant to pop in every day to feed their cats.

Mrs Pharro peels one of the thousands of post-its from the sole of her shoe as she and her husband come home for the first time 

Jamie and Emily Pharro came home to discover their entire ground floor covered in yellow and pink post-its 

Instead, their friends spent eight hours covering every inch of the ground floor of their house in Holbeach, Lincolnshire, with the sticky, yellow notes. 

A hidden camera in the couple's living room shows their surprise when they finally return.

'Our living room has got glass panels in the door, so we could see as soon as we got inside what they’d done and then we saw the camera,' said Mrs Pharro afterwards.

'The notes were all over the living room walls and everything. I think that in a few weeks we’ll still be finding the odd one about!' the 29-year-old added.  

Every nook and cranny of their kitchen and living room was covered, including the inside of their washing machine and television which bears the message: 'so sorry'. 

After seeing their friends fill another couple's house with 3,000 balloons, Mrs Pharro said she expected to be on the receiving end of their practical jokes. 

The couple's friends filled the inside of kitchen cabients, the washing machine and every surface with post-its

The couple said they were expecting their friends to pull some sort of prank on them while they were abroad

Jamie and Emily Pharro married in Cambridgeshire on August 1 before travelling to Lake Garda in Italy for their honeymoon 

'To be honest we quite expected to come home to something - our friends have a bit of a track record for this kind of thing,' said the newlywed, who spent two-and-a-half hours removing all the notes.

'Some other friends got married secretly last year and their living room was filled with balloons as a surprise on their return.

'But there was no damage here - it was just a bit of harmless fun, but I don’t think any of our other friends will want to get married now!'
