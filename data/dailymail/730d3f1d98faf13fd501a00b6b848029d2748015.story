Changing 175 nappies and making up 80 bottles of milk each week is no easy task.

But that’s just the start of new mother Sarah Ward’s to-do list.

She gave birth to four babies in the space of nine months – despite fearing that she would never conceive.

Surprise! Sarah Ward, 29, thought she was unable to conceive when along came Freddie (left) - followed almost exactly nine months later by triplets Stanley, Daisy and Reggie (centre). 'At times it's chaos', she said

Her son Freddie was nine months old when she had triplets, now aged 19 weeks, in March. All were conceived naturally.

So it may not come as a surprise that the former care manager and her partner Benn Smith, 31, a postal worker, are exhausted.

Brood: The couple have their hands decidedly full

Miss Ward, 29, said: ‘At times it feels more like running a nursery than a home, but we feel so blessed.

‘I was stunned when I found out I was pregnant again so soon. When we learned it was triplets we went into shock.

‘At times it’s utter chaos but we just laugh and get stuck in.

‘It takes two hours to prepare to leave the house but we don’t dwell on the hard work. I love babies so I feel like the luckiest mum in the world.’

Miss Ward had tried to conceive for more than a year and was due to see a GP for tests when she became pregnant with Freddie. So after he was born in June last year, the couple did not use birth control.

Miss Ward said: ‘We wanted to have at least two children. Because it had taken so long with Freddie, we assumed it would take the same time again, if not longer.’

In fact, Freddie was only eight weeks old when she learned she was expecting.

She said: ‘I started shaking. I had barely recovered from having Freddie. I was still wearing maternity clothing. I was wondering how on earth I was going to cope.’

A scan at 12 weeks revealed Miss Ward was expecting fraternal triplets.

She said: ‘The sonographer paused and asked if we knew how many babies we were having. Our mouths fell open because we thought she was telling us it was twins.

‘When she said triplets I nearly fell off the bed in shock. Neither of us could speak as she turned the screen to us and pointed out three little wriggling shapes. I just started crying when I realised they would be born before Freddie was one.’ 

Proud: Miss Ward said: 'When she said triplets I nearly fell off the bed in shock. Neither of us could speak as she turned the screen to us and pointed out three little wriggling shapes. I just started crying when I realised'

Industrial operation: Looking after the four babies involves changing 175 nappies and 80 milk bottles a week

The couple, from Crayford in south-east London, were warned the pregnancy was high risk and offered a selective termination – aborting one baby to give the other two a better chance. They decided against the procedure.

What the family need to look after Stanley, Reggie and Daisy: 

80 bottles of milk

175 nappies 

42 outfits

At 33 weeks, one of the babies showed signs of distress, so surgeons at Medway Hospital, in Kent, had to perform an emergency caesarean section. 

Stanley was born first weighing 3lb 12oz, followed by Reggie, 4lb 7oz, and sister Daisy, at 3lb 14oz.

Miss Ward said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when they kept passing over all these babies. When we saw all three side by side in their incubators it took my breath away.’

The triplets were finally allowed to come home last month.

Miss Ward said: ‘It’s like a tag team operation but we still find time for a cup of tea together when they first go to bed.

‘Then it’s back to the washing and laying out all the clothes and washing bottles for the next day. A quick walk to the shop can take hours, because so many people stop and ask me if they are all mine. They can’t believe it when I say yes.

‘But I love the fuss and attention they get. I’m so proud. I once thought I couldn’t have kids and then I got the perfect family in less than a year.’

Mr Smith said: ‘I won’t pretend it isn’t exhausting but it’s lovely to see how close they all are already.

‘Still, we won’t be trying for another any time soon.’

They're a bit of a handful, but Stanley, Daisy and Reggie are now 19 weeks old and full of energy

Miss Ward added: 'A quick walk to the shop can take hours, because so many people stop and ask me if they are all mine. They can’t believe it when I say yes. But I love the fuss and attention they get. I’m so proud'

FALLING pregnant so soon after having a baby is highly unlikely as breastfeeding acts as a natural contraceptive.

If a mother breastfeeds regularly, there is a high chance she will be temporarily infertile due to high levels of certain hormones such as progesterone.

According to the Family Planning Association, breastfeeding is a natural contraceptive method and is 98 per cent effective if undertaken regularly

But it only works if the mother breastfeeds every few hours including at night and only for the first six months of the baby’s life.

After this stage women are advised to use other forms of contraception.

The method - known as ‘lactational amenorrhea’ - has been considered by doctors as an effective form of contraception since the 1990s.

But in reality, very few women in the Western world rely on it partly because they do not breastfeed intensively enough.

Nonetheless, it is still possible for women such as Sarah Ward to become pregnant so soon after giving birth particularly if they are not breastfeeding regularly.
