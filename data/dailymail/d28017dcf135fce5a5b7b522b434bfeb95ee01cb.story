A benefits cheat who lied about her lover moving in has been ordered to pay back £87,000 - even though it will take her more than 40 years.

Blonde Sharon Cotter, 45, will pay taxpayers back the fiddled cash at £180 a month to clear it by the time she is 85.

A court heard Cotter was a single mother on benefits when she met Nigel Wade, 48, and moved him into her home.

Sharon Cotter, 44, a benefits cheat who hid her secret lover from the authorities so she could claim an extra £87,000, was ordered at Cardiff Crown Court to repay the full amount

She had two children with him, now aged four and five, but kept the fact he lived with her a secret from benefits officials.

Cotter claimed an extra £87,000 in housing benefits and child tax credits by pretending to live as a single parent.

She kept the fact that Wade moved in a secret because it would have caused her benefits to decrease.

But Cotter was caught after four years of fraud after the authorities were tipped off about the couple living together in the family home in Dinas Powys, Vale of Glamorgan.

The court heard how Cotter was a single parent when Nigel Wade moved in. They then had two children together but she kept their relationship secret from authorities

Judge Patrick Curran QC told Cotter: 
'As a single mother responsible for three children you were entitled to 
housing benefit and child tax credits.

'But you entered into a relationship with Nigel Wade.

'He moved into your home in May 2008 and from there on in you failed to notify the authorities of the change in your circumstances.

Cotter was given a 10-month jail sentence suspended for two years and given a 12-month supervision order

'The fraud carried on for a significant period.'

Adam Sharp, defending, said Cotter and her children had severe medical problems and any prison sentence would have a 'devastating effect' on her children.

Mr Sharp told the court Cotter was paying back the £87,000 at a rate of £180 per month from her benefits payments.

At that rate she will only just have paid taxpayers back by the time she is 85.

Cotter was given a 10 month jail sentence, suspended for two years, and was handed a 12 month supervision order.

Judge Curran said: 'With all the medical problems you and your children have it serves no public interest to see you jailed.

'It is in the public interest that you maintain your liberty and that your children are not deprived of their home, their mother and their carer.'
