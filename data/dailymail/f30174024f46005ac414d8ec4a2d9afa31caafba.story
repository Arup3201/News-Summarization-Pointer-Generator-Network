Britain should freeze immigration to stop foreign workers taking jobs from Britons, according to one of Ed Miliband’s key policy gurus.

Lord Glasman, who was appointed to the House of Lords by the Labour leader, said the country was not a United Nations ‘outpost’.

The peer also called for the UK to renegotiate rules allowing the free movement of migrant workers within the EU – a proposal that Mr Miliband insisted his close friend had not discussed with him.

Lord Glasman told the Daily Telegraph: ‘We’ve got to re-interrogate our relationship with the EU on the movement of labour.

‘Britain is not an outpost of the UN.
We have to put the people in this country first. The EU has gone from 
being a sort of pig farm-subsidised bloc to the free movement of labour 
and capital.’

Lord Glasman, a politics lecturer and
social thinker, said it may be necessary to stop immigration for a 
while to put British workers at the front of the queue for new jobs.

Such a move would also make it easier
for the genuinely deserving to be let into the country if they had 
in-demand skills, he suggested.

Lord Glasman said: ‘We should be more
generous and friendly in receiving those [few] who are needed. To be 
more generous, we have to draw the line.’

As founder of ‘Blue Labour’, which 
mixes the principles of faith, flag and family with socialism, he has 
admitted his views can be ‘more conservative than the Conservatives’ and
has accused Labour of lying over immigration.

Yesterday, Mr Miliband tried to play 
down the significance of his comments, adding: ‘I’ve said in the past 
we’ve underestimated the impact of Polish migration to Britain. It’s 
quite hard to negotiate the terms of free movement of labour.’

He said the right solution was to 
‘have a firm immigration policy, also to provide people with the 
guarantees that they need in relation to wages and conditions which is 
one of the biggest worries that people have about some of the migration 
that we’ve seen’.

But he was urged to heed Lord 
Glasman’s advice by Sir Andrew Green, chairman of the MigrationWatch 
campaign group, who said: ‘It’s quite clear that Ed Miliband still 
doesn’t get it if he’s talking about Polish migration when 80 per cent 
of net migration under Labour was from outside the EU.

The public are going to get very tired of continuing Labour evasion on a matter of deep and widespread concern.’

However, Sir Andrew admitted: 
‘Although Lord Glasman understands the depth of public feeling on 
immigration, renegotiating the free movement of people is over the top. 
It is simply not practicable.’

Ministers want to cut immigration to 
tens of thousands a year. But Lord Glasman’s renegotiation plan goes 
even further than calls by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith
for bosses to employ  young Britons ahead of foreigners.
