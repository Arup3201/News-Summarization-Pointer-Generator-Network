A fashion photographer is hoping to change the way that society views curvaceous women, by publishing a book featuring a series of images which celebrate fuller-figured women. 

New Yorker Victoria Janashvili, the woman behind coffee table book Curves, has had her work featured by the likes of GQ, Maxim, Esquire and Cosmopolitan, but insists that her 'personal projects' have always aimed to highlight the beauty of women with more normal bodies, rather than the slim models often pictured in the pages of magazines.

'My personal projects have always been aimed to portray a healthy and more relatable model,' she explains on her Kickstarter page, set up in order to fund the publication of her book, which is currently available for pre-sale.

Risqué business: Plus-size models Denise Bidot and Marina Bulatkina both pose nude in the art photography book

Let's get real: Victoria Janashvili hopes that Curves will encourage women to feel more confident about their own body image

'I feel very happy that the fashion magazines and [the] media in general [have] started to embrace a healthier image of a "beautiful woman" and that is why I strongly believe that this art book can help make a change even more.'

Ms Janashvili enlisted the help of plus-size models Denise Bidot, who has featured in campaigns for Nordstrom, Levi's and Old Navy, and Marina Bulatkina, who recently modeled for discount fashion store Century 21, both of whom agreed to pose nude for the book.

'Even though the average American woman is a size 14, our society continues to set sterotypes as standards when it relates to the real body image of women,' Ms Janashvili added. 

'This is why I spent years of my time taking pictures of different types of models and took part [in] numerous body image awareness campaigns that went viral, and caused lots of discussions. 

'Through my book, I would like to continue to spread the mission and break social stereotypes, so we can take a stand on women feeling confident within their own skin.'

'Your wife,  your daughter, your girlfriend, you': The photographer hopes that her book will appeal to women - and men - of all ages and body types

Thus far, the photographer has raised just over $4,000 since launching her Kickstarter page two days ago - and she is confident that this total will continue to rise as more people speak out in support of the project. 

'Your wife, your daughter, your girlfriend, your mother and most importantly YOU, will look at yourself differently, more [healthily], and more importantly, less; by expanding, and then reclaiming, the discussion about appearance, we can remove some of the focus from it in women’s lives, old and young,' she writes.

'We love your booty. Get it behind this book. The future of healthy booties, big and small, may depend on it.'

Ms Janashvili has been praised by women from around the world as a result of the book, with many hailing her as an 'inspiration' to people of all ages and body types.  

'I feel better about my body now': The book has had support from women around the world, including a 62-year-old grandmother from Puerto Rico who praised Ms Janashvili the perfect role model

Breathtaking: Many people have commented how beautiful each of the images in the book are 

'As someone who is considered plus size, your work is simply breathtaking,' one woman wrote. 

'Seeing women feel as beautiful as they do in your photographs inspires me more than you could imagine.'

Another added: 'I am a 62-year-old grandmother, who lives in Puerto Rico. Today I was thinking I didn't want to die without having some sexy pictures taken.

'I never had the nerve to do it while I was young because I was always self conscious about my body, even when I was beautiful and skinny. 

'But looking at your photographs and how gorgeous the models look I feel better about my body.'
