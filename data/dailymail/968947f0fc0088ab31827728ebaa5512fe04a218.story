A concentration camp uniform for sale on eBay is almost certainly a fake.

Forensic tests commissioned by this newspaper found thread used to sew on buttons and a name tag contained a dye not invented until after the Second World War.

The findings have added to the distress of the family of the man it was claimed wore the striped uniform, who were furious when it was put up for sale at £11,000.

This concentration camp uniform for sale on eBay at £11,000 is almost certainly a fake, according to an expert

The report caused worldwide outrage and led to an apology from the online trading site, which removed 30 items from sale – including the uniform.

Last week, scientists at Contact Traces, a forensic laboratory near Oxford, examined 27 fibre samples from the uniform.

Expert Lorna Stevens said: ‘The black thread used to sew the badge and the buttons on appears to be coloured with a Reactive Black 5 dye, which was not invented until 1954.

‘This throws serious questions on the likelihood the badge is associated with this uniform.

‘The findings so far appear to challenge its credibility as a genuine uniform.’

The striped pyjama-style concentration camp uniform was worn by death camp inmates

The seller, Viktor Kempf, 62, of Vancouver, claimed that the uniform had been worn by Wolf-Gierszon Grundmann, who died in Auschwitz, Poland, in 1941.

Mr Grundmann’s daughter’s half-sister, Fani Simon, 66, who lives in Tel Aviv, said: ‘I feel sick. He stole our relative’s identity. This is fraud.’
