An Italian soccer fan, who allegedly cut his wife and
children's throats in a triple murder, tried to use the England-Italy game as
an alibi.

The bodies of mother-of-two Cristina Omes, 38, and the
couple's children, five-year-old Giulia and Gabriele, 20 months, were found at
their home in the residential area of Motta Visconti near Milan.

All three were found with their throats slit as well as
other stab wounds, Italian newspaper Il Mesaggero reported.

Triple murder suspect Carlo Lissi, 31, on his wedding day with his wife, mother-of-two Cristina Omes. He is accused of killing her and their two children

Computer consultant Carlo Lissi has been charged with the
triple murder.

Following hours of questioning the 31-year-old allegedly
confessed to the killing, telling police to give him 'the maximum sentence'.

The father-of-two told detectives he had killed his wife
first, followed by the two children late on Saturday night, it is alleged.

He then left home at around 11.30pm, stopping en route to
the game to throw the murder weapon, a knife, down a manhole, police sources
told Italian newspaper La Stampa.

Carlo Lissi told police he watched the Italy Vs England game with friends after the triple murder, it is reported. Pictured here, Mario Balotelli of Italy scores his team's second goal

The young professional watched the game with friends in a
nearby town. When he returned home shortly after 2am to 'find' the bodies, he
called police.Â 

Lissi allegedly told police he committed the horrific
triple murder because he was in love with a colleague, sources told Italian
newspaper La Stampa.

A safe at the home was open with a small amount of money
missing, but investigators had focussed on a private motive early on because of
the murder of the baby, police sources told Italian media.

And the lack of a murder weapon caused them to rule out a
murder-suicide by the young mother.
