With just weeks to go for many to claim their holiday entitlement, research has revealed that British workers allow 60 million days to go to waste - worth a staggering £5.37bn.

For two in five of us, the holiday year runs from January to December, meaning time is running out to take that winter break.

Only half of all employees - falling to a third of those aged 18-24 - have claimed all the holiday due to them in their last full holiday year.

Almost half of the working population will lose an average of six days paid holiday a year

Forty-four per cent of the survey's respondents were in full-time employment, thus qualifying for at least 28 days' statutory leave per annum.

They lost around six days' paid leave, which is worth £542.40 based on the average weekly earnings of employees in Britain.

The same pattern is emerging for the current holiday year – with an average of over seven days still due to employees and little compensation if they cannot take their full entitlement. 

Only 10 per cent of respondents said that their employer has agreed to pay them in lieu of lost days. Seventeen per cent said they are too busy at work to take time off and a further 16 per cent said that their employer makes it difficult for them to take their full entitlement.

The problem becomes more marked for two in five workers (42 per cent) whose holiday year runs from January to December. The survey found that those employees have an average of 5.5 days' leave due to them before their entitlement runs out in less than two months' time. One in five still have 10 or more days of holiday entitlement left.

Thirty-one per cent of people on a January-December holiday year plan to get away in December

For many who intend not to lose their entitlement, booking a December trip away could be just the tonic - but again it's best to do your research.

Cost Comparison of a seven-night B&B flight-inclusive package for one with resort meals/drinks 

The Post Office Travel Money Holiday Entitlement Report reveals that 31 per cent of those whose current holiday year ends in December plan to use some or all of their entitlement on holidays before then.

Although people with paid leave to take before the end of December set a generous average holiday budget of £638 per person – rising to £1,000 or more for one in five (22 per cent), separate Post Office Travel Money research found that people would be better off to travel early in December rather than over the festive season.

A week away over Christmas and Boxing Day to four destinations rated among the cheapest in the Post Office's recent Winter Sunshine Report was found to cost 43-52 per cent more than it would earlier in the month.

A seven-night B&B flight-inclusive package for one with resort meals/drinks to the four-star Interpalace Hotel at Puerto de la Cruz, Tenerife would cost £383,000 departing December 6-7, but would be £805 departing December 20-23, a 52 per cent price hike.

Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: 'The message for people who have only a short time left in which to use up this year's holiday entitlement is clear: Do your homework on the timing of your trip and pick a destination where package costs are reasonable and resort prices low to ensure you get the best possible value.

'Early December is always a cheaper time to travel and our latest research has found that Tenerife and Cyprus are great value in Europe while those old favourites, Thailand and Sri Lanka, are good choices further afield.

'Keep an eye on exchange rate movements to ensure you get the most travel cash for your pounds. Calculate how much you are likely to spend while abroad and change enough cash to see you through, remembering that there are improved rates for higher value transactions.'
