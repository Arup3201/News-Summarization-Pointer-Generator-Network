Scotland put in a gutsy performance but were ultimately seen off by World Cup winners Germany in Dortmund on Sunday night.

Ikechi Anya equalised Thomas Muller's first half opener but the Bayern Munich hitman restored the host's lead minutes later with what proved to be the winner.

Scotland gave Germany plenty of problems in the second half but the world champions stood strong and they could have added a third with Muller hitting the post late on to deny him a hat-trick.

Here, John McGarry gives his verdict on the performance of the players. 

Celebrate: Ikechi Anya looks delighted with his goal but Scotland's joy was shortlived in Dortmund

GERMANY

MANUEL NEUER: Was thankful for Howedes blocking Bannan’s early strike then untroubled by Anya’s shot on stroke of half-time. Not a prayer as the Watford man motored through to equalise. 6.

SEBASTIAN RUDY: In for Kevin Grosskreutz at right-back, the Hoffenheim man justified his inclusion with a gem of a cross that allowed Muller to head high beyond Marshall. Had the measure of Bannan whenever the Scots broke forward. 7.

JEROME BOATENG: Bayern colossus had harder task to shackle Naismith than he probably imagined. Left for dead as Anya raced onto Steven Fletcher’s pass to score. 7.

Justified: Sebastian Rudy came in at right back and marshalled Anya well in the first half

BENEDIKT HOWEDES: Outstanding sliding block by the Schalke man steered Barry Bannan’s onto the bar. Gladly strode into central midfield to release Kroos or Kramer. Booked. 7.

ERIK DURM: Dortmund full-back had been savaged by Angel di Maria last week but this was a night for expression on the front foot. Muller ought to have converted his peach of a cross while Marshall did well to hold his fierce strike. 7.

CHRISTOPH KRAMER: Holding role beside Kroos but frankly it wasn’t much of a two-man job. Was able to get further forward to help Reus as Germany attempted to dissect the Scots’ defence. 7.

TONI KROOS: Madrid’s £25m man had James Morrison for company and the Scot ensured his opponent wasn’t allowed to dictate the pace of the game at will. Headed occasional scares off at the pass with wonderful recovery tackles. 7.

Recovery: Toni Kroos dictated the play and would not let Scotland take a grip in midfield

THOMAS MULLER: Preferred to Mario Gomez, the Bayern man missed a pinch of a header inside eight minutes. Made up for that 10 minutes later with a looping header to beat Marshall then poached the winner. Yellow. 8

MARCO REUS: Local hero was deployed off the front in the most fluid of formations. Twice tested Marshall from distance in the first half and miserly use of the ball contributed to the outcome. 7

ANDRE SCHURRLE: Chelsea winger was asked to go at Alan Hutton down the left. Had reasonable success but found the Aston Villa man reserves his best stuff for his country. 6

Contrast: Andre Schurrle strugged to get past Alan Hutton but Thomas Muller was at his best

MARIO GOTZE: Hero of the Rio final started at the point of the four-man attack but it was clear Low had given him licence to do as he pleased. Nippy, incisive runs and instant control of whatever was fired at him made him a thorn in the Scots’ sides. 7

SUBS

Podolski for Schurrle (84)

Ginter for Reus (90).

Late sub: Arsenal's Lukas Podolski came off the bench for the final six minutes in Dortmund

SUBS NOT USED

Zieler, Weidenfeller, Grosskrautz, Sam, Rudiger, Gomez.

Booked: Howedes, Muller

SCOTLAND:

DAVID MARSHALL: Justified his starting place over Allan McGregor with some superb saves in both halves. Helpless with goals. 7.

ALAN HUTTON: A trademark surging run so nearly earned Naismith an equaliser at the start of the second half. More like himself. 6.

STEVEN WHITTAKER: In at left-back after Andre Robertson’s injury and did fine in trying circumstances. 6.

Close run thing: Steven Whittaker marshalls Thomas Muller away from goal - he didn't score...this time

RUSSELL MARTIN: Passed a pre-match fitness test, but couldn’t maintain his record of three straight clean sheets. 6.

GRANT HANLEY: Blocked a certain second goal from Schurrle but toiled to deal with Muller. 6.

DARREN FLETCHER: Played in a deep lying midfield role sweeping up but needs time. Replaced by McArthur. 5.

Getting to grips: Darren Fletcher needs time and he wasn't gifted that by the relentless Germans

CHARLIE MULGREW: Finished the night with a red after two late bookings. Smashed superb shot offside upright early in game. 6.

JAMES MORRISON: Lively and inventive, trying to bridge the gap between Naismith and midfield. 6.

BARRY BANNAN: Had Scotland’s first effort of the match with a shot deflected over the bar. Replaced by Fletcher. 5.

Struggle: Barry Bannan couldn't make use of his creative talents and was often pushed back

IKECHI ANYA: Another outstanding night for the little winger, scoring a quite brilliant breakaway goal for the equaliser. 8.

STEVEN NAISMITH: So nearly drew the Scots level at the start of the second half. Ran tirelessly before making way for Maloney. 7.

SUBS

Steven Fletcher for Bannan (58). 6.

McArthur for Darren Fletcher (58). 6.

Making an impact: James McArthur saw an effort on goal blocked as he looked to impress from the bench

SUBS NOT USED 

McGregor, Gordon, Greer, Maloney, Bryson, McDonald, Burke, Reynolds, Forsyth, Martin.

Booked: Hanley, Mulgrew, Morrison.

Sent off: Mulgrew.

Referee: Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway)
