A 19-year-old Michigan girl missing since Saturday has been found stabbed to death and dumped in a river the day after her abusive ex-boyfriend was due to be sent to jail.

The body of Kaley Brooks was spotted trapped beneath the ice in the river on Christmas Eve, a few days after her ex-boyfriend, Nicholas Jackson, was found dead after apparently shooting himself.

Several stab wounds were found on Kaley and blood stains believed to be from her were discovered in a car belonging to Jackson.

Jackson, 18, was found dead on Sunday. Police say he had assaulted Kaley in October, and had been due to be sentenced to prison on Monday.

According to WILX10, after the aggravated assault in October he had been ordered to stay away from Kaley, who had suffered extensive injuries.

The college student was last seen on Saturday afternoon when Jackson picked her up from the McDonald's drive-thru where she worked.

Her mom had dropped her off at 3pm and Kaley, who hadn't been due to start her shift until 5pm, had told her manager she had errands to run before work.

Police believed she had been a victim of foul play from the moment she was reported as missing, MLive reported.

Jackson was believed to have been involved but police have said the investigation is still open.

Her body was found after a relative spotted one of her shoes on the river bank on Tuesday, just over a mile from Jackson's home.

'The development would be a sad one anytime of the year. Especially around Christmas time,' director Mike Jester said.

The victim's mother, Heather Brooks, told MLive before Kaley was found: 'She is just so loving and caring and sensitive to everyoneâ€™s needs.'

Ms Brooks, and Kaley's stepfather Curt 
Gibson, said the teenager had been in a troubled relationship with 
Jackson for just over a year.

Even though he had been ordered by a court to stay away, the couple still tried to meet up or message each other.

'Nick just had some type of hold on her,' Mr Gibson said, adding that the injuries she suffered back in October had been 'horrific' and needed hospital treatment.

A post-mortem examination is due to be carried out.
