A British jihadist from Coventry, nicknamed Osama bin Bieber, has been left disabled whilst fighting for Islamic State in Iraq.

According to a source close to his family, Hadi told his father in late December that he had suffered ‘serious spinal injuries’ and was now completely deaf in one ear. 

He has been recovering in Mosul hospital but it remains unknown whether he will be fit enough to ever fight again.

Teen terrorist: Mohammed Hadi,19, left his home in Coventry to join ISIS in March 2014. Hadi was nicknamed ‘Osama bin Bieber’ by social media users due to his boyish looks and spindly physique.

Prior to his injuries, the 19 year old had reportedly been used by Islamic State as a police officer in Mosul.

Islamic State police are responsible for arresting and punishing anyone who does not adhere to the group’s twisted interpretation of radical Shariah law.

Fluent in Kurdish, Arabic and English, Hadi used his language skills to interrogate suspects and was considered an important assetto ISIS police force. 

Hadi had also been active on social media, where he frequently urged British Muslims to join ISIS and carry out acts of terror against 'non believers'.

The Coventry Trio: Hadi travelled with school friends Ali Kalantar and Rashid Amani to Syria after reportedly being radicalised by a local imam.

Prior to his injuries, the 19 year old had reportedly been used by Islamic State as a police officer in Mosul. Fluent in Kurdish, Arabic and English, his language skills meant he was able to interrogate prisoners.

Hadi travelled along with school friends Ali Kalantar and Rashid Amani after being radicalised by a local imam.  

Flying to Turkey, the three friends crossed over the Turkish-Syrian border and joined Islamic State in March 2014.

However after completing basic training in Syria, Hadi left his two friends in Manbij and travelled with Islamic State for deployment in the Iraqi city of Mosul.

He regularly posted photos  of the ISIS held city on his private social media account until he  sustained his injuries last December.

Rashid Amani was known as Abu Massoud al-Khurasani whilst fighting for ISIS. Like Kalanter, he was of Afghan origin and had moved to the UK with his family when he was young.

Hadi’s mother has previously stated that her son must have been financially assisted by someone in order to go to Syria as she only gave him £14 per week as pocket money.

Hadi is the last suriving member of the Coventry trio following the death of his best friends Ali Kalantar and Rashid Amani last year.

19 year old Ali Kalanter was the first of the friends to be killed in battle. Known by his nom de guerre Ali al-Farsi, Kalanter was shot dead whilst taking part in an offensive near Tikrit University on 4 December 2014.

His death was announced by his widow, Zahra Halane, one of the ‘terror twins’ from Manchester. Describing him as ‘a blessing from Allah’, the 17 year old British Somali jihadist tweeted that she hoped ‘to join him very soon.’

Prior to joining Islamic State, Kalanter dreamt of being a model and was planning to study computer science at Coventry University.

Terror Twin's tribute: Ali Kalatner's death was announced by his widow, Zahra Halane, one of the ‘terror twins’ from Manchester. They lived together in the Syrian city of Manbij.

Model dreams: Prior to joining Islamic State, Kalanter dreamt of being a model and was planning to study computer science at Coventry University.

Teamates: Rashid Amani and Ali Kalanter played football together when they were at Barr Hill's School. Amani had been studying for a business degree at Coventry University before he joined ISIS

Kalanter was born in Afghanistan but grew up in Coventry after his family moved over to the UK when he was five years old.

He attended the Barr Hill's School with fellow British Afghan Rashid Amani, where they both played football for the school team.

Rashid Amani was killed by an US air strike whilst fighting at Kobane. Known as Abu Massoud al-Khurassani, Amani was unmarried but had been living with Kalanter and Halane in Manbij.

The 19 year old had been studying for a business degree at Coventry University before he joined ISIS.
