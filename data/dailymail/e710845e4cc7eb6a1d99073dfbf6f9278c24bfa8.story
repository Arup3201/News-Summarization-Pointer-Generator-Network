Crystal Palace's bid to sign Bolton winger Lee Chung-Yong for £1million is being held up by the player’s wage demands. 

Lee, who also has several offers from abroad, suffered a minor leg fracture playing for South Korea in the Asia Cup three weeks ago but is expected to return to training later this month. 

Bolton signed up the attacking midfielder in 2009 for £2million.
