The number of patients on NHS waiting lists is at its highest for nearly six years.

There are now 2.89million waiting for surgery or other hospital procedures, including nearly 550 who have been waiting for more than a year.

Official figures also show that, for the first time since March 2011, the NHS has missed a crucial target that patients should be treated within 18 weeks.

The health service is meant to ensure that at least 90 per cent of patients are treated within this time but the figure fell to 89.9 per cent in February, meaning that around 400 waited longer.

Labour warned that the NHS was heading back to the ‘bad old days’ when hundreds of thousands of patients, often in agony, waited up to two years for treatment.

The rise is further evidence of the growing pressures on the health service, which is struggling to meet the demands of the increasingly aging population.

Several experts have warned that it will have to make controversial changes, such as charging patients for routine treatment, to avoid bankruptcy.

A patient’s right to be treated within 18 weeks is set out in the NHS Constitution, the health service’s rule book.

If they are made to wait longer, they can demand to go privately – paid for by the NHS – although very few patients are aware of their rights.

Labour’s health spokesman, Andrew Gwynne, said: ‘Under David Cameron, waiting lists for operations are at their longest in years. He wasted £3billion on a damaging reorganisation and patients are paying the price.

‘Labour left NHS waiting times at a record low but on David Cameron’s watch the NHS is heading back to the bad old days with patients waiting months on end for treatment in pain and discomfort.’

The figures from NHS England show that the average patient waits 9.5 weeks after being referred by their GP, up from eight weeks in April 2010, just before the Coalition Government took office.

However, patients needing trauma or orthopaedic procedures – those involving muscles and bones – wait an average of 12.6 weeks, while those needing surgery to their mouth or teeth wait 12.7 weeks

The NHS Confederation, which represents health service managers, said: ‘We need to acknowledge that the whole system is under more pressure than ever. The NHS needs to change.’

Dr Barbara Hakin, chief operating officer at NHS England said: ‘The NHS does face a challenge on the 18-week standard but staff are working incredibly hard to ensure patients are seen quickly.

'During February, around 270,000 patients were admitted for treatment within the standard, and around 400 waited longer than we would have liked.

'We are doing more operations and treating more people than ever – over a million people start treatment with a consultant each month.

‘We are determined to redouble our efforts so that we do meet the standard.

‘But this may take several months as it is imperative we focus on those who have waited longest.’
