With the Flat season starting with Doncaster’s Lincoln meeting on Saturday, Sam Turner (Robin Goodfellow) picks out 10 horses for punters to follow.

DANZENO – Michael Appleby

Reported to have thrived again during the winter, we have arguably not seen the best of this 4yo who could achieve anything if he progresses mentally from last year’s campaign.

Michael Appleby's Danzeno is said to have thrived in the winter and has the potential to achieve anything 

FAYDHAN – John Gosden

This War Front colt was only seen once last term, but the impression created by his six-length Haydock defeat of a horse that won his next two starts suggests he is one to keep onside.

HILLBILLY BOY – Martin Smith

Progressed throughout last season and enjoyed a nice warm up on the all-weather recently. One to watch in 7f and 1m handicaps this term and the type to go well at Royal Ascot.

Hillbilly Boy had a good warm-up on the all-weather recently and could be one to watch come Royal Ascot

LADY TIANA – Lucy Wadham

Wound up last season with a facile Doncaster success on her beloved soft ground. Looks to be a mare capable of landing Group races over 10 or 12f when conditions suit.

Lady Tiana loves the soft ground and is capable of winning Group races over 10 or 12f when conditions suit

LIGHTNING MOON – Ed Walker

Edged out Danzeno in an Ascot Group 3 in the autumn to defend his unbeaten record. Goes well on soft ground and looks capable of graduating to the top sprinting table this term

Lightning Moon could graduate to the top table of sprinting this term, especially on soft ground

LIMATO – Henry Candy

Sauntered through his juvenile campaign, barely coming of the bridle to win Redcar’s Two-Year-Old Trophy in facile fashion. A major contender for sprinting honours this term.

Henry Candy's Limato is another major contender for sprinting honours this season

OL’ MAN RIVER – Aidan O’Brien

A potentially high-class stayer with speed, the son of Montjeu won both his juvenile starts at The Curragh and looks just the type to progress into a serious Derby contender.

POSTPONED – Luca Cumani

A powerful son of Dubai, Postponed appears just the type to thrive for his patient handler this term after impressing in a York Group 2 when last seen.

Postponed could thrive for patient trainer Luca Cumani after impressing when last seen in a York Group 2

TRYSTER – Charlie Appleby

Has improved beyond all recognition this winter, recording electric speed figures to win four races, including the Winter Derby. Could also be a threat on turf.

OSARUVEETIL – William Haggas

Took an age to get on the track, but once he did, wasted no time in comprehensively beating 10 rivals in a Kempton maiden. Potentially smart colt from a winning family.
