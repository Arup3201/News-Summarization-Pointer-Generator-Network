Monica Lek befriends her neighbours and captures them in intimate moments in her portrait series 'My Neighbours'

Barcelona-born Artist Monica Lek moved from Spain to New York and has been taking photos of her diverse neighbours ever since. She snaps photos all over the globe.

New York has at least 8 million faces and Lek has managed to capture intimate portraits of captivating passersby, the rich, the poor, and the eccentric.

Her portrait series entitled, 'My Neighbours' is a collection of these photographs.

According to the artist's website, 'Monica Lek was born in the sea. She has an infinite sense about it. She is a photographer and visual artist based in New York. All pictures are taken in 35mm.'

In an interview with a Madrid based newspaper, El País, Monica opens up about her relationship with photography in New York.

She describes how New York 'kicks' it's inhabitants but also allows for them to live a different life every day.

Upon moving from Spain she got jobs working as an assistant to photographers Richard Kern and Francesco Carrozzini. Everything happened 'fast.'

She freelances and is also a contributor of Intern Magazine.The magazine is a  forthcoming, bi-monthly independent print publication concerned with interns and internships in the creative industries. 

Now Monica is expanding her body of work by incorporating video and playing with the fantasy the reality of the camera lens can bring. The portrait series  of her neighbors are rich with images of New York and with Monica's 'infinite' and unique vision.
