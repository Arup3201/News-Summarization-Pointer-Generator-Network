David McCormack, 63, failed two breath tests within hours of each other after he was stopped by police in South Shields, Tyne and Wear

A man caught drink driving was arrested for the same offence just hours later after he returned to a police station to collect his belongings - still drunk from the night before.

Daniel McCormack, 63, was stopped in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, after officers were alerted to his ‘erratic driving’ and pulled him over.

He recorded a reading of 372 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 milliletres of blood - more than four times the legal limit.

After being released from South Shields Police Station, he drove back the next morning to collect his possessions where suspicious officers performed another breath test.

The reading revealed McCormack was more than two times over the limit, and he was arrested again.

He was banned from the roads for three years after he admitted two counts of driving with excess alcohol at South Tyneside Magistrates Court.

Sarah Guest, prosecuting, said: 'He was seen by police driving erratically. They see the vehicle and ask the driver to stop. 

'Another vehicle stops behind, and says he has been driving like that for a while.

'The following day, a police officer on duty at South Shields Police Station saw the defendant in the station, and noted he smelt strongly of alcohol.

'He was seen getting into his Ford Focus car in the car and drove at a slow speed. He was stopped at that point and given a roadside breath test. 

Mccormack, from Hebburn, Tyne and Wear, was given a 12 week jail sentence - suspended for 12 months - and was banned from driving for three years.

He was also ordered to pay costs of £30 following the event at 10.25am on Saturday, March 29.

Carole Whittingham, Secretary of the Campaign Against Drinking And Driving, says she is unsure What it will take’ for magistrates to exercise their powers to jail drink drivers.

She said: 'This is a very high reading. Anybody who is over the drink and drive limit is a danger.

'What do you have to do for magistrates to use their power to jail offenders for up to six months?'

He was released from the cells at South Shields Police Station in Tyne and Wear - but drove back a short time later to pick up his belongings and was arrested again by a suspicious police officer
