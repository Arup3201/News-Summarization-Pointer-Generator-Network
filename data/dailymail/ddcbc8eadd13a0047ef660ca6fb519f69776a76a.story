America is facing the worst drought 
in decades as nearly 220 counties in a dozen states are added to the 
list of natural disaster areas.

The
additions to the long list of devastation yesterday came as the US 
agriculture chief unveiled new help for frustrated, cash-strapped 
farmers and ranchers trying to grapple with the extreme heat and 
dryness.

The affected 
counties have been designated primary disaster areas this growing 
season, the vast majority of them mired in the drought.

Counties
in Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Mississippi, 
Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee and Wyoming were included in
yesterday’s announcement.

The
US Department of Agriculture (USDA) uses the weekly US Drought Monitor 
to help decide which counties to deem disaster areas, which makes 
farmers and ranchers eligible for federal aid, including low interest 
emergency loans.

To help 
ease the burden on the nation's farms, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack
has opened up 3.8 million acres of conservation land for ranchers to 
use for haying and grazing.

Help for farmers: The US Agriculture Department has unveiled new help for frustrated, cash-strapped farmers and crop insurers have agreed to provide farmers with a 30 day grace period on premiums

Under
that conservation program, farmers have been paid to take land out of 
production to ward against erosion and create wildlife habitat.

He
said: ‘The assistance announced today will help U.S. livestock 
producers dealing with climbing feed prices, critical shortages of hay 
and deteriorating pasturelands.

Mr
Vilsack also said crop insurers have agreed to provide farmers facing 
cash flow issues a penalty free, 30 day grace period on premiums in 
2012.

As of this week, nearly 
half of the nation's corn crop was rated poor to very poor, according to
the USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service. It is the worst rating since the last major drought in 1988.

About
37 per cent of the US soybeans were lumped into that category, while 
nearly three-quarters of U.S. cattle acreage is in drought-affected 
areas, the survey showed.

The
potential financial fallout in the nation's midsection appears to be 
intensifying. The latest weekly Mid-America Business Conditions Index, 
released yesterday, showed that the ongoing drought and global economic 
turmoil is hurting business in nine Midwest and Plains states, boosting 
worries about the prospect of another recession, according to the 
report.

Creighton 
University economist Ernie Goss, who oversees the index, said the 
drought will hurt farm income while the strengthening dollar hinders 
exports, meaning two of the most important positive factors in the 
region's economy are being undermined.
