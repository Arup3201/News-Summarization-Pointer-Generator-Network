One to watch

South Korea's Bayer Leverkusen forward Son Heung-min was unplayable at times in the Bundesliga this season and was largely responsible for his side’s surprise 1-0 win away to Borussia Dortmund in December. Best used on the counter-attack, the 21-year-old will be crucial to his side’s chances of springing an upset.

Familiar face

Former England boss Fabio Capello is in Russia’s dugout.

History lesson

South Korea have won their last three World Cup openers.

Did you know?

Russia are slightly leaky in defence. They have kept only one clean sheet at their last six World Cup tournaments.
