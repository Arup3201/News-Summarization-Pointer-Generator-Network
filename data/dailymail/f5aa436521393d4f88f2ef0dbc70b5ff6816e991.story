Celebrity chef James Martin turned on the Health Secretary today and told him his new plan to improve hospital meals 'is going to do nothing'.

The Saturday Kitchen presenter, a hospital food standards campaigner, also said he has tried persistently to set up meetings with Jeremy Hunt but the minister is always 'too busy'.

It came as disgruntled patients sent pictures to MailOnline of hospital meals they considered 'pitiful' and 'disgusting'.

Jeremy Hunt has ordered a review into hospital food, asking NHS trusts to meet specific standards and threatening fines for the worst offenders, but chef James Martin said today 'it will do nothing'

Hospital canteens have been blasted for serving unhealthy options such as pie and chips and the Health Secretary says trusts will be forced to overhaul their menus 

Today the Health Secretary announced new rules to ensure hospitals improve their food or face fines, and made it compulsory for trusts to serve meals that meet basic standards and ensure staff help patients to eat them.

He ordered trusts to overhaul canteen food so healthier options are available rather than burgers, chips and pies and stop salt being added to vegetables.

But James Martin accused Mr Hunt of not thinking through his proposals.

He wrote on Twitter: 'For 5 years I've worked in hospitals all over the country and this idea is going to do nothing.

'Providing tap water is brilliant one... though that must've taken a lot of thought'.

Urging Mr Hunt to meet with him he said: 'I'm here if you want me to help and will be available anytime, 7 days a wk as you're office says you're "too busy" all the time.

'I'm here from now until the election'. 

Jeremy Hunt has not responded. 

Jeremy Hunt has vowed to raise food standards in NHS hospitals and visited the Royal Marsden in Chelsea today to see how their meals are made

Diane Jeffrey (right, with Hunt) said: ‘Getting hospital food and drink right is critical... No hospital can afford to neglect this’

Pictures have emerged  of substandard food in hospitals, including this cheese and tomato sandwich

Yesterday the Mail published shocking photographs of hospital food sent in by patients including congealed rice pudding and soggy broccoli.

Others were served chicken pie with raw pastry, mince burned on to the plate and, in one case, a half bowl of tomato soup and salad.

Dieticians said the meals were either so unappetising or meagre that they hindered patients’ recovery because they would not get enough nutrients.

But starting from December, a basic set of standards governing hospital food will be written in to each trust’s NHS contract.

These include checking patients for malnutrition when they are admitted and ensuring they are given enough help at mealtimes by nursing staff.

Trusts will also have to provide fresh fruit and offer healthy options at canteens that are low in sugar, salt and fat.

From today patients will be able to see how the food was rated on the NHS choices website

Standards will be monitored by the Care Quality Commission as part of routine hospital inspections.

If a trust breaches these standards they could be fined by the local GP-led Clinical Commissioning Group. From today patients will also be able to see how their local hospital has been rated for food on the NHS Choices website.

Each trust has been given a score out of 100 for quality and choice and the website also states whether they provide fresh fruit and food between meals.

Mr Hunt said: ‘We are making the NHS more transparent, giving patients the power to compare food and incentivising hospitals to raise their game.

‘Many hospitals are already offering excellent food. But we want to know that all patients have nourishing and appetising food to help them get well faster and stay healthy, which is why we’re introducing tough new mandatory standards for the first time ever.’

But Alex Jackson, of the Campaign for Better Hospital Food, said the new measures were ‘woefully inadequate’.

He pointed out the standards which hospitals were required to meet were very basic, including that they provide tap water.

He said: ‘We’re left feeling that he has pulled the wool over our eyes. We want to see hospital food standards set down in legislation, similarly to school food standards.

‘But the Government still refuses to do this and has only committed to including the standards in NHS commissioning contracts, which are long documents full of clauses that without proper enforcement and monitoring can be ignored.’

Dianne Jeffrey, chairman of Age UK, which led the review of hospital food, said: ‘Getting hospital food and drink right is critical and should also be considered an important part of someone’s medical care. No hospital can afford to neglect this.’

The NHS in England receives 480 written complaints a day, with hospital doctors and surgeons among those bearing the brunt of patients’ frustrations. 

There were almost 175,000 complaints in 2013/14 – 3,300 a week – according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre.
