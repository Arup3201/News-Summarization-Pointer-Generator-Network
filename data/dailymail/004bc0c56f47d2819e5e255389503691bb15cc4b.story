A mother left paralysed after giving birth has arrived home to find a gleaming $45,000 Nissan Navara complete with a giant red bow parked on her front lawn and a note from an anonymous Good Samaritan.

Jessie Bruton, 27, lost feeling in both of her legs after pressure on her spine caused severe nerve damage while she was pregnant with her third son nine months ago.

The mother of three found the white Nissan Pathfinder outside her house in Oak Flats, south of Wollongong, last month.

'I had a really bad day... I was in heaps of pain. We came home and the car was there. I didn’t think it was for me. We sat around out the front for ages before we checked if it was open,' Mrs Bruton told MailOnline.

The generous donor left a card inside the car saying they hoped the gift would make Mrs Bruton smile considering what she has faced.

'My husband Mick was crying, I was crying and my boys were running around trying to find DVDs to put in the car,' she said.

'I stared at it for ages, but when I jumped in I realised it had been converted for me. It was pretty amazing.'

The car has been fitted with hand controls and is big enough to accommodate her walking frame, wheelchairs and prams for her young sons - Levi, 7, Nash, 2, and six-month-old Klay.

'At first I thought my friend Kylie was behind it because she’s been organising a fundraiser. But I rang a few people and no one knew anything,' Mrs Bruton said.

The Bruton's used the hand-over papers in the car to contact the seller but she wouldn’t reveal who the generous buyer was.

'Then I thought they did it out of the kindness of their heart so I shouldn’t dig around to find them if they don’t want me to,' she said.

Mrs Bruton said she would be 'forever grateful' and wished she could hug the anonymous donor.

'They have no idea what they’ve given me,' she said.

'Klay was our last baby, we’d bought a house, I'd finished my certificate III in fitness.

'Everything was in place and it turned our world upside down. It’s been really hard to rely on others so much.'

Mrs Bruton, who had been driving for 10 years before she was left paralysed, passed her disability driving test on Tuesday.

'My husband and I went and had a coffee last night and I drove him. I felt normal for the first time in 12 months,' she said.

Doctors are not sure if Ms Bruton will ever walk again unaided, but the former fitness instructor said she was doing as much physiotherapy as possible to help.

Mrs Burton, her husband and three boys had to move back in with her parents while they raise money to modify their family home.

Her friends have organised a fundraiser at Wests Illawarra Leagues Club on Friday night. For more information, visit jessiebruton.eventbrite.com.au.

Jessie said she has had to rely on her husband Mick more than ever in the past 12 months
