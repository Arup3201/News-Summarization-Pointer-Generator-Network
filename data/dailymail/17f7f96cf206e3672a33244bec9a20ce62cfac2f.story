Britain is now a cleaner country thanks to the army of volunteers who have hit the streets in a mass spruce-up for the Diamond Jubilee.

In an extraordinary response to this newspaper’s anti-litter campaign, more than 25,000 people from all walks of life pulled together to make sure the country looks its best this weekend.

Those signing up to the Daily Mail’s Spring Clean for the Queen campaign included everyone from fast food and supermarket workers to company chief executives and Rotary Club members.

Some volunteers, such as those pictured here cleaning up in Birmingham, even donned Royal face masks for the occasion

Scores of Britain’s biggest firms backed the campaign, with Tesco, Lloyds TSB and Marks & Spencer organising mass clean-ups for thousands of employees. Environment charities have praised the success of the Mail’s campaign, which was set up only four weeks ago in response to the litter strewn across our parks, pavements and waterways.

John Read, of campaign group Clean Up Britain, said: ‘The Daily Mail’s campaign has had a tremendously positive impact in galvanising people all over the country to get out there, clean up Britain, and pick up litter that’s scarring their local communities.

‘It’s great to have seen so many companies and their staff getting involved, and it shows that people up and down Britain do really care about our beautiful country.’

George Monck, of charity Cleanup UK, added: ‘The Daily Mail single-handedly brought the country together on the issue of litter.

‘Her Majesty is going to be delighted about all the efforts being made to clean the place up for her. It’s been the most high-profile litter campaign for a long time. Well done, everyone.’

Efforts were stepped up in the week before the Jubilee, with 500 shop workers blitzing Oxford Circus in the West End on Wednesday. The workers, from stores including Debenhams, Gap and House of Fraser, picked up 1,400 pieces of gum during an hour-long clean.

The coffee shops were also doing their bit, with bosses at Starbucks and Caffe Nero joining baristas in litter picks in London last week.

Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: ‘Congratulations to the many community-minded volunteers and organisations who are pulling together to spruce up London ahead of the Diamond Jubilee, during what is undoubtedly one of the most exciting and inspiring years in this great city’s history.’
