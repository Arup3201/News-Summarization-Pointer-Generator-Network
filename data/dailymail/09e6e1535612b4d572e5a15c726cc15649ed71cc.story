American Apparel decided to fire their controversial CEO based on new information saying he  allowed an employee to impersonate and post naked photos online of an alleged victim of his sexual abuse who filed a case against him in 2011.

The New York Post reports that the clothing company is investigating the alleged misconduct against Irene Morales, now 21. The clothing company fired Dov Charney at a Wednesday meeting based on his list of taboos they found were a liability to the company.

This week, the board at American Apparel accused Charney of allowing and employee at one of his Los Angeles stores to post naked photos of Morales on a blog that was meant to appear as though it belonged to Morales, Insiders told the post.

CEO Dov Charney holds the company title no more after he allegedly allowed an employee in Los Angeles to impersonate his alleged victim Irene Morales online

The blog not only allegedly broke a California law that forbids people from falsely impersonating someone online, it also 'harassed and defamed Morales.'

The board at American Apparel says that since Charney allegedly knew the blog was posted and didn't do anything to stop it that he was exposing the company to a liability.

The $260 million lawsuit filed against Charney in 2011 by Morales was tossed by a Brooklyn Judge in 2012 and instead brought into arbitration.

The lawsuit was complicated by a report from March 25, 2011 that said Morales allegedly sent nude photos of herself to Charney after she stopped working at the store.

The photos allegedly were paired with titillating come-ons like, 'Daddy’s got a little naughty girl waiting for him,' which Morales supposedly wrote, said Charney’s lawyer Stuart Slotnick.

Even though the case was tossed, the blog posts exposed American Apparel to more recent damages.

Irene Morales, 21, said that Charney allegedly made her his sex slave and new information states Charney may have allowed an employee to impersonate her online

A source told The Post that a settlement 'in the low six-digits' was underway but it wasn't clear if the settlement had been finalized or not.

Despite the previous case being sent into arbitration, Charney lost his title of chairman and he's been suspended from his post as CEO of American Apparel for 30 days.

The post spoke with the American Apparel co-chairman Allen Mayer on Friday who said the board got new incriminating information on Charney but said that they refused to discuss it any further.

'We have heard for years allegations and rumors in newspaper stories that were not sufficient to take action,' Mayer told The New York Post.

'But what came to our attention was not allegations and rumors but established fact.'

The board also mentioned that certain severance payments were made to some female employees without consent from the board.

The board also said that Charney used company funds to arrange travel plans for his mother.

To add to his string of taboos, a video of Charney dancing naked in front of two female employees. Pictured dancing naked around his office, this is the boss of fashion brand American Apparel who was sacked over alleged misconduct.

Dov Charney founded the firm in 1989 but has been accused of sexual harassment by at least eight of his staff – and was kicked out of the company this week.

The video of the businessman gyrating in the nude in front of two women emerged 24 hours after he was fired.

Without apparel: Sacked American Apparel CEO Dov Charney is seen in a video posted online two months ago dancing naked in front of two women

Charney, who earned himself the nickname 
‘pants optional’ after parading around his US factory in only his 
underwear, was unanimously voted off the board as chief executive, 
chairman and president after a four-month investigation into actions 
considered detrimental to the company.

The short clip of the 
45-year-old Canadian businessman shows him dancing naked to upbeat music
 while talking on his mobile phone.

‘I’m dancing right now for 
Daisy,’ he informs someone on the other end of the line.

Naked truth: The women in the video have been identified by a one-time American Apparel staffer as current of former employees of the retailer

One of the 
women off-camera is heard telling him to shake his ‘booty’, and he then 
scuttles away with his hands covering his modesty.

It was not clear last night when the video was taken or whether its discovery had contributed to him being fired.

But
 a former model for American Apparel has confirmed that the man in the 
video is ‘100 per cent’ Charney.

Another former staff member at the 
fashion retailer claimed the women in the footage both worked for 
American Apparel.

Born in Montreal, Charney started American Apparel while he was still a student.

The
 business now has 10,000 employees and 249 stores in 20 countries, 
including the US and the UK – but the brand has faced criticism for 
using overtly sexual images in some of its advertisements.And 
Charney, who once described himself as ‘a bit of a dirty guy’, has faced
 repeated accusations of sexual misconduct from female employees.

Courting controversy: The retailer has repeatedly come under fire for using young models dressed in sexy clothes to promote the brand

In 
one, former saleswoman Irene Morales claimed she was held as a sex slave
 for eight months just after she turned 18, when she was forced to 
perform sexual acts in Charney’s Manhattan apartment.

In a separate 
claim, Miss Morales and several other woman said they were forced to 
pose nude in a series of pictures which later surfaced on the internet.

All the cases have been either dismissed or settled, but the company 
announced Charney’s departure on Wednesday.

Weakened: Morales's claims were later  undermined by a trove of explicit pictures and messages she allegedly sent her boss

Legal victory: Two years ago, a New York judge tossed Morales' $260million lawsuit against Charney

Chairman Allan Mayer, who
 has been on the board since the company went public in 2007, said: ‘We 
take no joy in this, but the board felt it was the right thing to do.

‘Dov
 Charney created American Apparel, but the company has grown much larger
 than any one individual and we are confident that its greatest days are
 still ahead.’

American Apparel’s share price rose by more than 20 
per cent after the announcement. But at 40p a share, the firm’s value 
has dropped dramatically since 2008, when it could command more than £8 a
 share.

Unexpected dismissal: Charney reportedly did not see his termination coming and will fight to regain control of American Apparel

As a teen growing up in Montreal, Canada, Dov Charney was obsessed with American culture.

He has described his early envy of the choice available in America as compared to Canada in terms of how many 'hundred' different breakfast cereals teenagers south of the border could have.

He adored the simple fashions of classic, bargain brands such as Hanes and Fruit of the Loom and began importing them and selling them to classmates while in High School.

His early entrepreneurial spirit is evidenced by his claims to have sold 10,000 t-shirts while still a student, buying and transporting his stock himself in a rented U-Haul truck.

Charney launched American Apparel in 1991 with a $10,000 loan from his father while still attending Tufts University.

The company was originally conceived as a wholesale business manufacturing basic T-shirts, allegedly inspired by Charney's ex-girlfriend.

By 1997, the humble sewing operation cranking out T-shirts has grown significantly, moving first to Charleston, South Carolina, and then to its now famous seven-story 800,000-square-foot Los Angeles factory.

In 2003, American Apparel expanded into the retail market, with stores popping up from coast to coast and beyond.

American Apparel has built a large fan base thanks to its commitment to manufacturing all its clothing in the U.S. instead of outsourcing the work to other countries.

The company also prides itself on paying employees fair wages and providing health insurance, which is uncommon in the garment industry.  

Charney claimed to have the 'highest earning apparel workers in the world.'

By 2005, Charney was looking at over $200million in annual revenue and in 2014, he had more than 260 stores worldwide, with revenue in excess of $500million. A year later, the prosperous business was sold for more than $380million to Endeavor Acquisition Corporation, but Dov Charney stayed on as president and CEO.

Beginning in early 2000s, the fashion mogul has faced accusations of sexual misconduct, with as many as nine former employees suing Charney for alleged harassment. However, all the cases have been either dismissed or settled out of court.

In 2009, things took a turn for the worse for American Apparel when the company found itself teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, which was narrowly avoided thanks to an $80million loan.

Six months later, American Apparel was forced to fire 1,800 workers after federal agents raided its factory and discovered that many employees were in the U.S. illegally.

The once-thriving retailer continued struggling, and three years after American Apparel went public the New York Stock Exchange threatened to remove its listing because of delayed quarterly filings.

In a bid to turn the company around, Dov Charney went on the offensive, closing several dozen stores, focusing on efficiency and harnessing the power of Groupon to sell clothes at a discount.

The past two years have been a roller coaster ride for American Apparel, with strong quarters followed by losses and more bankruptcy talk. With Dov Charney’s firing, the company is once again looking at an uncertain future.                                                                                                                         Source: Business Insider
