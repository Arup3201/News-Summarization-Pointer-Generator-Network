Whistleblower: Former SDS officer Peter Francis has lifted the lid on the murky practices of the unit which targeted political groups

The Met police used undercover officers to spy on political groups who campaigned against police mistreatment and corruption, it has been alleged.

It is believed at least three officers were sent by Scotland Yard to infiltrate London-based activist groups in the latest allegations to be made against the secretive Special Demonstrations Squad (SDS).

One was Mark Jenner who used the alias 'Mark Cassidy' to join the Colin Roach Centre - a group set up in the 1990s in memory of a 21--year-old black British man who died in police custody in Hackney, the Guardian reports.

A second spy targeted the Newham Monitory Project - another north east London group which campaigned for victims of police brutality and racist attacks.

Jenner, who was married with children, is said to have had a a four-year relationship with one of the women he was investigating.

The latest revelations come in the wake of allegations, revealed yesterday in a TV documentary, that undercover officers from the SDS unit were told to try and get 'dirt' on the family of Stephen Lawrence, the black teenager murdered in a racist attack in 1993.

Whistleblower Peter Francis, 48, also said he was told to
target Stephen’s friend Duwayne Brooks, who witnessed the murder, as 
well as other campaigners furious at the failure to bring his killers to
justice.

The whistleblower added that senior 
Scotland Yard officers withheld details of his role from the Macpherson 
Inquiry into the bungled police investigation into 18-year-old Stephen’s
killing.

The allegations have provoked widespread condemnation from politicians and anger from the Lawrence family.

Stephen's father Neville last night demanded a judge-led inquiry into an apparent police smear campaign against his family.

Mr Lawrence, 71, said it was an ‘unthinkable betrayal’ that Scotland Yard 
would mount a dirty tricks operation following his son’s racist murder.

But he said he had always suspected his family was ‘under greater investigation’ than the gang that killed Stephen in 1993.

Theresa
May said yesterday the extraordinary allegations should be examined by 
two existing inquiries into police wrongdoing. Mr Lawrence said the Home
Secretary’s plan was ‘completely unsatisfactory’.

Peter Francis lived a double life as he spent years infiltrating radical anti-racists groups

Home Secretary Theresa May said a probe into the units may not be completed until 2016

Boris Johnson, the London mayor, said the allegations were 'deeply, deeply unsettling'.

Derbyshire’s Mick Creedon, who is 
leading an inquiry into the Special Demonstration Squad and another 
shadowy police unit, the National Public Order Intelligence Unit, said 
he was looking 'right up the chain of command' to find out who 
authorised the 
‘completely abhorrent’ tactics.

Prosecutors
have been asked to consider whether criminal offences took place over 
the course of five decades when the police 'spies' were being planted 
inside protest groups.

It 
raises the prospect of a string of hugely damaging court cases at a time
when public trust in the police is already at a worrying low with the 
Stephen Lawrence smear claims and Hillsborough disaster cover-up.
