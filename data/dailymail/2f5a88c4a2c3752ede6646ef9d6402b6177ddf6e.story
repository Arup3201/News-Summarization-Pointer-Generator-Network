A terrified window cleaner was rescued by a high-tech drone after the scaffolding he was on malfunctioned.

The man was cleaning windows close to the top of a high rise building in central Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, when the motorised scaffold stopped working and started tilting dangerously.

The Security Media Department sent a wireless remote-controlled drone to rescue the cleaner amid dramatic scenes yesterday.

After calming the panicked worker, who had attempted to abandon the scaffold and cling to a window for fear of falling, the drone detected the technical malfunction of the scaffold, and an expert instructed the worker on how to repair the malfunction himself using audio equipment. 

Abu Dhabi Police (ADP) received the emergency call about a window cleaner, who had become stuck on the building’s 10th floor, and sent teams from the Civil Defense Department, the Emergency and Safety Department and an ambulance  to the scene.

They evacuated the surrounding areas to ensure the safety of pedestrians in case the crane or any of its parts should fall.

After his ordeal medical tests were conducted and the man was found to be in good health.
