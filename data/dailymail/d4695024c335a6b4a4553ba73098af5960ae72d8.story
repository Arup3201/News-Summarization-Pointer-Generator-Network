A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order offence after a young soccer star was so badly abused by the crowd in an FA Cup match that he broke down in tears.

Oldham defender Tom Adeyemi became upset after becoming the target of a section of the crowd at the famous Kop end at Anfield during Liverpool's tie with Oldham.

Police are investigating after fans allegedly called the youngster 'a f****** black b******' during their team's 5-1 victory over their lower league opposition.

The man, from Aintree, was arrested yesterday by Merseyside Police, who are investigating the incident, but he has since been released on bail.

It is understood that Adeyemi, 20, has given a
 statement to police in which he claimed he was the victim of a racist 
attack.

The event will undoubtedly mar the 
club's reputation following the recent suspension handed out to striker 
Luis Suarez for racially abusing Manchester United defender Patrice 
Evra.

And football is still reeling from the 
fact that England captain John Terry, meanwhile, is to face trial 
accused of racially abusing Queens Park Rangers' defender Anton 
Ferdinand during Chelsea's defeat at Loftus Road earlier in the season.

Race is also high on the political agenda, with this week seeing the jailing of two thugs, Gary Dobson and David Norris, for the murder of young black teenager Stephen Lawrence in 1993 in Eltham, South-East London.

It was near the end of the FA Cup 3rd round match at Anfield that last night's ugly incident took place. 

Abuse seemed to emanate from the famous Kop end of the ground where, according to witnesses, fans were seen wearing Luis Suárez T-shirts and brandishing scarves bearing the player's name.

Adeyemi turned to confront his abuser, becoming visibly upset. Players from both sides intervened with Liverpool 
captain Steven Gerrard and striker Dirk Kuyt among those attempting to 
reassure the Oldham player.

As players from both teams tried to calm down Adeyemi, fans in Liverpool's stands then began singing the name of Suárez, upsetting the young player even more. He appeared to be in tears as he lifted his shirt to wipe his face.

A witness who gave evidence to 
Liverpool officials and the police was quoted by the Guardian as saying:
 'I was to the right of the Kop and the No11 turned to walk away after a
 tackle.

'I heard a single voice shout, "You 
f****** black *******." He spun round with shock on his face and started
 pointing at the crowd, from where the shout had come.'

Liverpool today said it had passed on CCTV footage, photographs and statements from stewards to the police as well as giving officers access to video filmed for its in-house TV channel.

A statement said: 'Liverpool Football Club continue to work closely with Merseyside Police to establish all the facts surrounding the incident that occurred during last night's game.

'We take this matter extremely seriously and have today provided the police with the evidence we currently have available to us.

'In addition, we have examined records of the tickets purchased in that part of the ground to see if they provide any additional information and have passed that on to the police. 

The abuse comes just days after the jailing of two men for the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence in 1993

'Finally, we would also urge any of 
our supporters who witnessed this incident or saw the individual 
involved and who have not already done so, to contact either the club or
 the police.'

Local
 police have released a statement, adding: ‘Merseyside Police can 
confirm that no one has been arrested this evening (Friday, 6 January) 
on suspicion of racially aggravated behaviour during tonight's FA Cup 
fixture at Anfield.

‘However,
 the Force and Liverpool Football Club are investigating following an 
incident that occurred during the second half of the game.

‘The
 aim of the investigation is to establish the full circumstances 
surrounding the incident to ascertain if any action needs to be taken.’

Today football fans around the world were expressing their disgust with the events at the match on Twitter.

Sai Adithya wrote: 'The way the #LFC fans started singing Luis Suarez after abusing Adeyemi is plain disgraceful!'

Meanwhile,
 Paul Dunn was able to turn the abuse into a dark joke that reflected 
the bad feelings over Liverpool's handling of the case involving Suarez.

He
 wrote: 'Liverpool FC officials are desperate to identify the fans who 
racially abused Tom Adeyemi, so they know which names to print on the 
t-shirts.'

Others took the abuse, coming so soon after the Suarez scandal, as evidence that Liverpool was a 'racist football team'.

South
 African football fan Kabelo MKhonto wrote: 'Liverpool is a racist 
football team fi[r]st they abused Patrice Evra now Tom Adeyemi who was 
visibly upset and tearful...'

And
 back in the UK Patrick McCafferty from Doncaster tweeted: 'Shocking 
abuse aimed at Tom Adeyemi last night. LFC should be embarrassed and 
ashamed. Racists WILL WALK ALONE. Horrible club and fans.'

Oldham manager Paul Dickov said he had not spoken to the player about the incident, but accepted something had upset him.

Police have arrested a man after former Liverpool star Stan Collymore was racially abused on Twitter.

Northumbria Police said the man, 21, was being held on suspicion of racially aggravated harassment and was being held in custody.

The investigation began after Staffordshire Police passed on an allegation to Northumbria colleagues in the early hours.

Collymore, 40, originally from Cannock, Staffordshire, played for a string of top clubs, including  Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest.

He works as a radio pundit for talkSPORT, campaigns against racism and is a supporter of the charity Depression Alliance.

Collymore was sent a series of tweets from someone believed to be in the Tyneside area.

'From my point of view I have not spoken to Tom about it but I know the kid and something has been said,' he said.

The Scot continued: 'He is a placid 
boy, a kid who has been well-educated with a fantastic temperament and 
has been with us since the end of August and I've never seen him raise 
his voice.

'For him to 
react like that it is obvious something has been said but what has been 
said I don't know because I've not had a chance [to ask] - I was too 
busy praising my players.

'He is fine now. He has calmed down. He is a laid-back kid who just gets on with business.

'Our
 players went and calmed him down and the Liverpool players did as well,
 which was fantastic and is why they are top professionals.

'I
 have been told the police are investigating it but that is all I know.'
 Born and raised in Norwich, Adeyemi is on loan to Oldham Athletic from 
Norwich City, who he signed for in 2008, aged 17.

He
 made his debut for Norwich in 2009, and in 2010 was named Championship 
Manager Apprentice Of The Year at the Football League Awards.

All eyes will be on the reaction of Liverpool, especially after the Suarez saga.

The Uruguayan was accused of calling the
 French international 'negrita' - literally translated as 'black' more 
than ten times during their 1-1 draw at Anfield.

He has since been banned for eight 
weeks and eventually apologised, but did not say sorry to the player 
himself.

Distastefully, Liverpool players showed solidarity for their 
team-mate by wearing Luis Suarez T-shirts after he was charged.

Racism is high on the political and social agenda at the moment after Labour MP Diane Abbott found herself enmired in a race row over comments on Twitter suggesting white people like to play 'divide and rule', apparently referring to colonialism.

Criticism of the Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP deepened after she yesterday suggested that taxi drivers were racist and would not stop for black people.
