A takeaway worker who led a gang attack which left a teenager with a fractured eye socket has been jailed for two years.

Ali Haydor, 22, punched Daniel Stringer-Prince, 17, at least twice before a gang of youths continued the assault, repeatedly kicking and punching the victim in the head.

Student Daniel and a friend were attacked by a group of Asian youths who had been involved in a snowball fight with a group of white teenagers.

Detective Inspector Dave Moores said of the attack:
‘What started off as quite a trivial matter of people throwing 
snowballs, was escalated much further by others including Haydor, who 
subjected one of the victims to a wholly undeserved and violent attack.

‘This man has now been left with 
lasting injuries, including damage to his sight in one eye, but the 
consequences of this assault could have been far worse.

Judge Leslie Hull QC said to Haydor: ‘You punched him 
at least twice about his face. That served as an invitation for the rest
of the group to then set about him, kicking him in his head and his 
body. It only came to an end when a car drove up alongside.’

Haydor, of Croft Street in Hyde, showed 
no reaction as he was jailed for two years at Manchester’s Minshull 
Street Crown Court.

The families of Mr Stringer-Prince and his friend who were injured in the attack said: ‘We are pleased with today’s result at court and that our son’s attacker is now behind bars for what he did.

‘We can now start to try and put this behind us and are focusing on trying to get life back to normal for Daniel as soon as possible after he has undergone his remaining surgeries.’

The teenage victim believed the attack 
was racially motivated but following a police investigation Haydor was 
simply charged with assault, which he admitted.

Prosecutor Barry Darby did not suggest the case was racially motivated in his opening address to the court.

Detective Inspector Moores said: ‘People
in the Hyde area were horrified at news of this attack and in the days 
afterwards, the community came forward with information that helped us 
piece together the events of that night. Both the police and the 
victim’s families were extremely grateful for that support.

‘Today,
Haydor has been sentenced for his mindless and violent behaviour and I 
hope his victims can take some comfort in seeing him put behind bars for
the suffering he has caused.

‘Since
the incident happened in February, the communities of Hyde have come 
together to show their solidarity and strong community spirit.

Mr Stringer-Prince (pictured with his mother) has been left with lasting injuries. The families of him and his friend said they were 'pleased' that their sons' attacker had been imprisoned

'Not content with just letting these events pass, the community have been working tirelessly for the last six months to create opportunities for different people to come together.

‘Their most recent event, which took place in October, attracted around 3,000 local people from different backgrounds, ages, cultures and communities.’
