Kris Commons says he wants Celtic’s arch-rivals Rangers in the Scottish Premiership as soon as possible — despite the Ibrox club suffering a lamentable 2-2 home draw with Alloa on Tuesday night.

Championship leaders Hearts could clinch automatic promotion to the top tier if results go their way this weekend.

That would leave Rangers embroiled in a grim battle for the second promotion spot under new manager Stuart McCall, although on current form they could even miss the play-offs.

However, in a view unlikely to curry unanimous favour amongst Celtic supporters, Commons — who scored in the recent League Cup semi-final between the Glasgow giants — admits he wants the Old Firm fixture back next season.

‘Personally, yes, because the games with Rangers are the best games,’ said the Parkhead forward.

‘They draw the best crowds and a large TV audience for people around the world. It makes people want to get out of bed in the middle of the night in Australia.

‘My mates down south don’t know much about Scottish football but they want to see that game. I love playing in them.

‘There are a lot of fans who are on the fence (about) whether it’s right or wrong but I love them.’

The new board still hope the return of Ibrox icon McCall can spark an improvement as they battle Hibernian for second place.

The Ibrox side were hot favourites to finish top of the league at the beginning of the season, but Commons remains unsurprised to see them struggle.

‘I have played in the Championship in England with teams trying to get back up and it’s not easy,’ he continued. ‘Some teams go down from the Premier League and they end up in League one, like Blackpool, Sheffield United and Wednesday.

‘Not only does it affect the players, the manager, coaches and fans, it’s a city thing. It’s a massive thing.

‘It’s very difficult to have the wind knocked out of your sails.

‘When you are struggling — as Rangers are — that’s when you need to call on experience and that’s why they have tried to go with Stuart McCall.’

Commons scored the opener as Celtic secured the League Cup with a 2-0 win over Dundee United on Sunday.

The Parkhead side can take a huge step towards their target of a rare domestic treble by beating the Tannadice side again in Wednesday night’s Scottish Cup quarter-final replay at Parkhead.

Jock Stein and Martin O’Neill completed domestic clean sweeps when Rangers were strong, but Commons rubbishes any suggestion of a diminished achievement in the absence of their Glasgow rivals.

‘I think the last time it was done was in an era when money and wages were massive,’ he said.

‘You look at the teams — (Chris) Sutton, (Neil) Lennon, (John) Hartson and (Henrik) Larsson — people who were on fortunes and I think that they got a huge amount of credit for what they did.

‘If we can get across the line and achieve this Treble, I don’t think it should be looked upon as a lesser achievement. It’s the same level.’

Last season’s Player of the Year, meanwhile, plans to take any penalties against United after admitting the on-field spat between James Forrest and John Guidetti over a missed spot-kick on Sunday was regrettable.

‘I don’t think that has ever happened before at Celtic,’ he said. ‘It’s the sort of thing you see on The Football Years on TV. It was like a (Paolo) di Canio-(Frank) Lampard moment.

‘I can understand from John’s point of view because he has taken a couple of penalties and scored. He has not been on the score sheet a lot of late. He’s a striker and he wants to get goals.

‘But they were not great scenes — probably just an eagerness to score and win.

‘It perhaps put a little dampener on the way that we won. The manager bases a lot on team spirit and team bonding.

‘We are meant to have this good unit as a team but, clearly at the end of the game, it looked as though people were doing things on an individual basis.

‘I don’t think any player should throw a strop on a football field. You should never do that.’
