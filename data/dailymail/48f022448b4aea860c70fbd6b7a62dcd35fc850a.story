Scans of Otzi the iceman have already given unprecedented insights into how our ancestors lived, but the latest find could be one of the most significant.

Not only have researchers discovered the 5,300-year-old mummy suffered from atherosclerosis - narrowing of the arteries due to fatty deposits - they have found he may have been genetically predisposed to the condition.

This is significant because evidence of genetic tendencies are notoriously difficult to obtain due to the degradation of remains.

Following a whole-genome study of the iceman (pictured) researchers discovered he had an increased genetic risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). In particular, the iceman's genome featured several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been linked with modern-day cardiovascular disease in more recent studies

The find also highlights that despite lifestyles becoming more sedentary since Otzi was alive, genetic predisposition and risk for the condition today appears to be very similar to that in ancient times.

Atherosclerosis is a potentially serious condition where arteries become clogged up by fatty substances known as plaques or atheroma.

The plaques cause affected arteries to harden and narrow, which can be dangerous as restricted blood flow can damage organs and stop them functioning properly.

If a plaque ruptures, it can cause a blood clot. This can block the blood supply to the heart, triggering a heart attack, or it can block the blood supply to the brain, triggering a stroke.

The research was carried out by Professor Albert Zink from the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman at the European Academy of Bolzano in Italy.

Following a whole-genome study of the Tyrolean iceman, a glacier mummy from the Alps, the researchers discovered he was at increased risk of coronary heart disease.

In particular, the iceman's genome featured several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that have been linked with modern-day cardiovascular disease in more recent studies.

This is of particular interest because CT scans of Otzi have already revealed major blockages in several major blood vessels, including the carotid arteries, distal aorta, and right iliac artery.

This is of particular interest because computed tomography (CT) scans of Otzi (pictured) have already revealed major calcification in several major blood vessels, including the carotid arteries, distal aorta, and right iliac artery. All of which are strong signs of generalised atherosclerotic disease

Otzi (pictured) was unearthed in September 1991 by German tourists trekking through the Oetz Valley, after which he was named. His perfectly preserved body is stored in his own specially designed cold storage chamber at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Italy at a constant temperature of -6°C

The authors added that modern traditional cardiac risk factors - such as being overweight, smoking, lack of physical activity, and a high fat diet - can generally be ruled out in a person from this era.

In particular, the genetic sequencing data demonstrates that Otzi had a very specific genetic mutation - namely that he was homozygous for the minor allele (GG) of rs10757274, located in chromosomal region 9p21. 

This is currently seen as being among the strongest genetic predictors of heart attacks, and has been confirmed in several studies as a major risk factor for heart disease.

The 5,300-year-old ice mummy, known 
as Otzi, suffered from the world's first-known case of Lyme disease - a 
bacterial parasite spread by ticks, according to DNA analysis.

Analysis also revealed Otzi was 5ft 2 inches (1.5 metres) tall, had brown 
eyes, had relatives in Sardinia, and was lactose intolerant. 

He was unearthed in September 1991 by German tourists trekking through the Oetz Valley, after which he was named.

He was believed to have been around 46 years old when he died. 

The iceman has been crucial to the understanding of how prehistoric people lived, what they wore and even what they ate.

The iceman's tattoos (pictured) which are largely seen on the parts of his body that endured wear-and-tear, lead archaeologists to liken the practice of tattooing to acupuncture, which is itself an ancient treatment for joint distress

For example, researchers examining the contents of his stomach worked out that his final meal consisted of venison and ibex meat.

Archaeologists believe Otzi, who was carrying a bow, a quiver of arrows and a copper axe, may have been a hunter or warrior killed in a skirmish with a rival tribe.

A hole in his collarbone suggested he was killed by an arrow, then a brain scan concluded he died from a fall.

But research from the European Academy of Bolzano/Bozen (EURAC) in Germany more recently discovered he suffered brain damage likely caused by a blow to the head.

Researchers also believe he was arthritic and infested with whipworm, an intestinal parasite.

His perfectly preserved body is stored in his own specially designed cold storage chamber at the South Tyrol Museum of Archaeology in Italy at a constant temperature of -6°C. Visitors can view the mummy through a small window. 

Alongside his remains is a new Otzi model created using 3D images of the corpse and forensic technology by two Dutch artists – Alfons and Adrie Kennis.  

‘Our ancestors going back thousands of years show signs of atherosclerosis,’ said the researchers.

‘Even though our human ancestors lived far different lives than we do, their environments and lifestyles were not protecting them against the development of atherosclerosis.’

They added: ‘What is similar between now and then is the human genetic material, our genome, were uncovered to predispose the carrier to the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

‘However, our ancient ancestors were certainly susceptible to many other conditions, such as infectious diseases, nutritional deprivation, and trauma.

'[These] often resulted in death at an early age, before atherosclerotic heart disease had a clinical impact.’

Future genetic studies of ancient humans have the potential to provide more insights into the presence and possible changes of genetic risk factors in our ancestors.

‘The study of ancient humans and a better understanding of the interaction between environmental and genetic influences on the development of heart diseases may lead to a more effective prevention and treatment of the most common cause of death in the modern world,’ concluded the researchers.
