Under a cloud: Investigators found no conclusive evidence whether Christie was aware or not of the closures of lanes on George Washington Bridge in September 2013 that caused gridlock in the town of Fort Lee

New Jersey lawmakers probing politically motivated traffic jams near the George Washington Bridge last year have been unable to rule out that that Gov. Chris Christie was involved in the scandal.

They have been trying to determine who ordered traffic lanes to be blocked in September 2013 at the bridge and why. 

The closures caused gridlock in Fort Lee, the town at the base of the heavily traveled span linking New Jersey and New York, and appear to have been directed at the town's mayor, a Democrat who did not endorse Christie.

Christie has always denied any wrongdoing. 

And yesterday investigators found no conclusive evidence whether Christie was aware or not of the closures, but they say that two former Christie aides acted with 'perceived impunity' and with little regard for public safety when they ordered the lanes closed.

The findings came in a 136-page interim report by a joint legislative panel, released yesterday.

'At present, there is no conclusive evidence as to whether Governor Chris Christie was or was not aware of the lane closures either in advance of their implementation or contemporaneously as they were occurring,' states the report.

'Nor is there conclusive evidence as to whether Governor Christie did or did not have involvement in implementing or directing the lane closures.'

A report commissioned by Christie previously cleared him of any wrongdoing and a lawyer for the governor said in a statement yesterday that the report corroborates that investigation.

'The Committee has finally acknowledged what we reported nine months ago - namely, that there is not a shred of evidence Governor Christie knew anything about the GWB lane realignment beforehand or that any current member of his staff was involved in that decision,' Christie attorney Randy Mastro said in a statement.

The report said that several critical witnesses have not testified and that important questions remain unanswered. The report will be supplemented if more information is obtained.

The report says that former Christie aides Bridge Anne Kelly and David Wildstein acted with 'perceived impunity' and that they acted with little regard for public safety. 

It says that the Christie administration responded 'very slowly and passively' to the lane closures.

Documents released earlier this year showed that Wildstein, then an official at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and Kelly, then an aide to Christie, orchestrated the shutdown, apparently as retribution toward Fort Lee's Democratic mayor.

In one email, Kelly told Wildstein, 'Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.'

Wildstein later contended that Christie knew about the lane closures as they happened. Christie, a possible 2016 Republican presidential contender, denies that he had any role in or knowledge of a plot to shut down the lanes.

An investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office is continuing. No one has been charged.

The legislative panel is scheduled to meet on Monday to formally release the report to the public.
