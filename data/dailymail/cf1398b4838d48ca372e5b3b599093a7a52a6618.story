She was an architect, carving out a promising career in New York in 1996, working on projects in the Hamptons and Connecticut, while living in an apartment in the affluent Park Slope area.

He was a convicted murderer, a high school drop out with an interest in the occult, doing time on death row accused of killing three eight-year-old boys as part of a Satanic ritual.

Within three years Lorri Davis and Damien Echols, one of the infamous West Memphis Three, would be married - touching for the first time on their wedding day.

In 1994 Damien was convicted of killing three eight-year-old boys in West Memphis, Arkansas, along with two of his friends, Jason Baldwin and Jessie Misskelley Jr.

In August 2011 Echols and his co-accused would eventually be freed, but for fourteen years Lorri found herself having a romance with, and eventually marrying, a man in high security prison.

Speaking to the New York Post, Lorri has told the story of that romance, starting with writing letters to Damien on a whim after seeing a documentary about his court case.

Damien, who had long hair and an interest in the occult, was convicted of killing three eight-year-old schoolboys in 1993 as part of Satanic ritual

She said: 'I knew something horrible had gone wrong here on every level: the community, the case, the convictions. I thought: “There’s no way he could have committed this crime.”'

A week after the screening, she decided to write to Damien, telling him she had seen the film and asking if he needed anything. A week later, she got a reply.

Reading the note, Lorri recalls that 'he didn’t write like a guy who’s on death row but like a Southern gentleman.'

That letter began a bizarre but touching romance that Lorri kept hidden from everyone except a few close friends. She didn't dare to tell her parents, and after a while felt like she was living a double life.

A few months after their first message, Damien wrote to say he loved her. Without having to think about it, Lorri wrote back to say she loved him too.

They soon began calling each other and met face-to-face for the first time in 1997.

Lorri flew down to Little Rock the night before, and had to be at the prison by 8am the next day.

Wearing dark blue pants, a black sweater and Doc Marten boots, she  was brought into a room where Damien was sitting on the other side of a glass partition.

She said: 
'It was very upsetting. He had lost so much weight since the documentary
 was filmed. His hair was really long, and he had long fingernails.

'I mean, he’s a gorgeous man, but you could tell that he was suffering greatly.'

The only gap in the glass was a small window at the bottom covered in wire mesh so they couldn't touch. Instead they sat up against the partition to be as close as possible.

The pair called each other every day, met once a week in order to watch TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer together, and still wrote to each other up until Damien's release

A letter Damien write to Lorri, starting 'My lovely one'. In it her calls her his 'beauteous thing', assuring her the relationship 'will work out' and ends by saying 'I am yours forever'

Back in New York, Lorri's work began to 
suffer as her mind wandered to Damien. They kept in constant contact, 
and called each other every day.

In the end, Lorri had to start budgeting for how and when they would speak, as she was running up a bill of $500 a month, according to xojane.com.

In 1998, a year and a half after they first spoke, Lorri made a life-changing decision. To the shock of her friends, family and colleagues, she quit her job and moved to Little Rock to be near Damien.

She took a job earning barely a quarter of her previous salary, but it didn't matter.

This way she could visit him every Friday when they watched shows like Buffy The Vampire Slayer together.

The pair married while he was still in jail in December 1999, touching for the first time on their wedding day

Soon they were engaged. Lorri says it 
took her parents about a year to adjust to the news, before the two were
 married on December 3, 1999 - the day they touched for the first time.

According to prison regulations, the Buddhist ceremony was supposed to last 20 minutes and contain only a small amount of kissing, but throwing caution to the wind, Lorri and Damien kissed constantly, and the wedding lasted over an hour.

While Lorri was engrossed in the moment, she realises now that the day was very hard on Damien, who nearly passed out from stress at one point.

Damien had not touched another person for six years, and had barely been around more than one person at a time.

That stress was just a taste of what life would be like when Damien was released from jail 12 years later, in part thanks to fundraising from Lorri, and also because of celebrities such as Johnny Depp, and musicians Eddie Vedder and Dave Navarro, campaigning for him.

Damien was freed in August 2011, thanks in part to campaigning and fundraising by Lorri, after agreeing to plead guilty to the crime in return for not suing the state for wrongful imprisonment

At first the couple lived in a Manhattan apartment of Peter Jackson, who produced the documentary West of Memphis about the case, before moving to Salem, the town of the infamous witch hunts.

Some members of the community shunned Damien, with one writing a blog detailing his every movement about the town, so they have now moved to an apartment in Harlem.

Lorri says the couple are still adjusting to life together, including writing, giving public speeches, and campaigning to find the real killer behind the West Memphis murders.
