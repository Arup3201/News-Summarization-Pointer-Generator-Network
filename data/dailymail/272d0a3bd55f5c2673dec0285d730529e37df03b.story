BBC workers have slammed one of the corporation's leading offices after being left at work without internet or telephone connections.

Staff at New Broadcasting House in West London deemed the building 'unfit for purpose' when, despite a £1billion refurbishment, lifts and dishwashers in the building broke down repeatedly. 

Among other complaints was faulty equipment, cold canteen food and substandard IT services which left workers 'fed up'. 

Workers claimed the resources at New Broadcasting House in west London were substandard, with internet and phone connections often breaking down

Their woes were revealed in published in the corporation's in-house magazine Ariel in the form of a letter written by Paul Moss, who works for The World Tonight on Radio 4.

'I had to deal with out telephone system not working, the internet connection breaking down on my computer ("You've got a profile problem, mate")... and the archive having an ongoing issue,' Mr Moss bemoaned. 

'Fed up with trying to work like this, I set off for the canteen but the lift was broken, and the non-automatic automatic door still had its sign apologising for the inconvenience of its continued breakdown.' 

Mr Moss also complained that the dishwasher seldom worked, and questioned how so many problems were occurring after such a costly refurbishment.

'How did a brand new building with brand new equipment end up with so many of its fixtures and fittings not working properly? And is anyone being held accountable for this?'

Other workers have complained about broken microwaves, cold canteen food and no forks to eat with.

One worker, who asked not to be identified, said: 'There are 6,000 of us in this supposedly state-of-the art building, but everything just keeps on breaking down.

Under construction: In 2007, extensive construction work began at the site in Portland Place 

In 2012, after five years of buiding, works were ongoing at the site. More than £1billion is thought to have been spent in the vast refurbishment 

'At first it was put down to teething problems, but a lot of us have been here for a couple of years now and so many things are still breaking down or causing major problems.

'For an organisation like the BBC not to have internet connection or phone service - even if just for a while - is embarrassing.

'The minor stuff, like the broken dishwashers, queues for the microwaves and broken lifts is just normal stuff really, but when you think that £1bn was spend on getting this place ship-shape, it is quite ridiculous.'

Building manager Andy Baker said he didn't 'recognise' the building described in workers' complaints.

'Like any workplace of this size there will occasionally be problems that need resolving, but the overwhelming feedback we receive is that New Broadcasting House is a great place to work and we don’t recognise the picture being painted in this letter. 

'The Facilities Management team at NBH work hard to ensure the building runs as smoothly as possible.'
