Gary Neville had barely digested his first breakfast under the new world order when he waded into an online debate with those who thought England should simply try to copy the way Germany produce footballers.

Those people are either ‘oblivious to the obstacle’ or they ‘believe in magic wands’, rapped Neville on Twitter. ‘You might as well say England needs weather like Spain.’

He claimed Germany’s ‘holistic approach’ could not be transported across the North Sea and added: ‘We are going to have to find our way of doing it because the system we have doesn’t allow us to adopt the German route in its entirety.’

Fronting up: Gary Neville admits England are unable to copy Germany's model for success

Germany’s first World Cup triumph in 24 years has aggravated some unhealed wounds.

It is not simply the bitter football rivalry but the painful proof that England are being left behind as others accelerate and are losing the ability to convert our raw materials into footballers of genuine world-class ability.

At the heart of Germany’s victory in Brazil is the fact that six of those selected by Joachim Low for the final before Sami Khedira’s injury in the warm-up – had started in the final of the European U21 Championships in 2009, when the Germans had beaten England 4-0 in Malmo.

From the England team that day, only James Milner made it to Brazil, although Joe Hart is another who would have played for the U21s five years ago had he not been banned and Theo Walcott would have been at the World Cup but for injury.

But it goes a little deeper. All but one of those who started for Germany in Malmo went on to play senior international football, including some who switched flags.

Fabian Johnson played for the USA at the World Cup and Sebastian Boenisch played for Poland in the qualifiers.

Ashkan Dejagah, who missed the final against England through suspension, was in Brazil with Iran.

Rising star: Toni Kroos is on the brink of a move to Real Madrid

Then there was Toni Kroos, the poster boy for the U21 Euros in 2009; a prolific young striker from Bayern Munich who was injured and unable to take part in the tournament. Germany got by without him, and Kroos developed into a midfielder, now on the brink of a move to Real Madrid.

It was indeed an exceptional crop but, still, it goes deeper. Germany made the decision to deliberately restructure its youth development programme at the start of this century and these are the results coming to fruition.

'Other young players are coming,' warned Wolfgang Niersbach, president of the German FA (DFB).

It’s true, in the same year that Germany’s U21s were winning in Malmo, their U17s were winning the European title with a team featuring a certain Mario Gotze, scorer of the only goal in the World Cup final.

This could be an era of domination, as Low said, born out of a disappointing display (by their own standards) in Euro 2000, when they lost to Kevin Keegan’s England and the old foes were out together, after the group stage.

England crossed their fingers and hoped players like Michael Owen, David Beckham, Steven Gerrard, Paul Scholes and Frank Lampard would continue to progress at their clubs, while Germany went home and overhauled their Academy system to make sure the next generation was much better.

The advantage they had was that the DFB and the Bundesliga were almost one entity at the time and the governing body had power to force change upon its clubs. Strict regulations were imposed in youth development from 2001.

He didn’t spell it out but this is probably Neville’s 'obstacle'. The relationship between the power brokers inside the English game is complicated by the rich history and the community roots of a 92-club pyramid.

One of its biggest strengths has been its biggest weakness when it comes to international football.

As Germany sorted itself out, the FA did next to nothing and things conspired against them. They took an age to build St George’s Park and neglected coach education while clubs routinely denied young players release to play for their country at U19, U20 and U21 level and, in some cases, the players were happy to be denied it.

At the same time, clubs made it harder for these young players to get into the first team by signing more foreign players and the development process stalled.

The argument is well-worn and still everyone points fingers of blame at each other. The FA does one thing, the Premier League another and the world hurtles towards another season and the qualifying campaign for Euro 2016.

'I’m confident the mountain is starting to move, but it’s a slow shift and results will take time,' said Neville, who perhaps understands (or represents) the confused forces as well as anyone in his dual role as England coach and Sky Sports analyst.

As he tweeted away about Germany and England, Sky were confirming the matches being shunted around for live broadcast and issuing a press release in which Neville was quoted saying: 'I can’t wait for the new season and I can’t wait for Sky’s live matches. I can’t wait to get back into the studio.'

Really? Others can’t wait for a major tournament when it’s not quite so embarrassing to be English, but, failing that, sure, bring on the Premier League. It will be great entertainment as ever and we can all do with the distraction.
