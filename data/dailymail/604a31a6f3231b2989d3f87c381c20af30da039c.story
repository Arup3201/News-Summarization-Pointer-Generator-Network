When beautician Katie Cutler set up a fundraising page for Alan Barnes she hoped to raise a respectable £500 to help the disabled pensioner feel safer in his home after he was mugged and left with a broken collarbone as he put the bins out.

But the 21-year-old never expected to inspire people from as far afield as New Zealand and Canada to donate in their droves so that the money would be enough to buy Mr Barnes a new house. 

As donations exceeded £300,000 in just four days people are calling for Miss Cutler herself to be rewarded for her philanthropic attitude.

Katie Cutler set up a fundraising page for mugging victim Alan Barnes, which raised more than £300,000 - well wishers have launched a campaign to raise money for Miss Cutler and calling for her to be awarded an OBE

Miss Cutler had an emotional first meeting with Mr Barnes on Sunday and insists she does not need rewards  

A Facebook page has been set up praising her efforts and calling for her to be awarded an OBE.

A separate fundraising campaign has also been launched for her, which has so far raised £500 - despite the mother-of-one insisting she does not want the money.

Police have also renewed their efforts and appealed for information to help find the thug who carried out the 'cowardly' attack on the pensioner, outside his Gateshead home at about 6.30pm last Sunday. 

Detective Constable Chris Barnes said the assault had left the 67-year-old feeling vulnerable, but he had been boosted by the support of people who had donated to help him. 

He said: 'But the main thing for us is to find the person responsible for this cowardly assault against a man unable to defend himself and we need the public's help.

'We do not have a description or direction of travel of the offender but someone will know something about the man involved.' 

DC Barnes said they had some forensic evidence but little information about the culprit. 

Donations to the Alan Barnes fund, through website gofundme, tipped £300,000 this afternoon and pledges are still being made almost every minute.

Mr Barnes plans to use the money raised by Miss Cutler's fundraising page to buy himself a new house  

Catherine Kirkley, of Northumberland, has launched the fundraising page for 21-year-old Miss Cutler. 

She said: 'I have never met Katie Cutler but I felt touched by her efforts, as a mother of an autistic child who has experienced bullying and violence I feel we need to make a stand. All funds will be handed to Katie via PayPal in order for her to spend as she wishes.'

Wellwishers left comments on the new funding page, showing their support for Miss Cutler.

Thousands of people from across the globe have donated and in four days the fund has exceeded £300,000

Mr Barnes said the selfless act by Miss Cutler and other people who had donated had restored his faith 

Doug Roberts said: 'Katie, you will go far in life with your selfless attitude. You've become something of a celebrity, and the Alan Barnes fund is gonna be something in your CV that people will always remember you for.

'In your wildest dreams, you could never have imagined last week, that by now you'd have raised enough to buy Alan a home outright! True serendipity, and a story that's taken the world by it's heartstrings.'

There is also a Facebook campaign for the generous mother to be awarded an OBE to honour her fundraising efforts. A page called 'Katie Cutler For An OBE' already has more than 230 members. 

Diane Bore posted: 'I wish this gentleman could live next door to Katie someone who has shown him so much love and support the world needs more people like her in it.'

Tracy Roberts wrote: 'How about something like the Alan Barnes foundation. We call all take Katie's lead and help others. Also show those hideous types of people they won't win. Just an idea.' 

Under the Go Fund Me rules, Miss Cutler and Mr Barnes can request access to the funds which have been donated at any time, and it will be paid to them within a week.

Some supporters have called for the website to waive its five per cent fee on the donations - set to add up to at least £14,000.

Miss Cutler and Mr Barnes have spoken of their amazement at the reaction to the fundraising appeal

However the organisation said it would not be able to waive its fees in this case. 

A spokeswoman said: 'As you might imagine, we receive many requests to waive fees, along with other concessions. In order to be fair, if we waive fees for one cause, we're obligated to also waive fees for others.

'Unfortunately, if we began waiving fees on a regular basis, there would be no way for us to build and maintain the website. Simply put, there would be no GoFundMe.

'Our hearts go out to Alan Barnes and his family during this difficult time. The campaign set up for Alan is a shining example of what can happen when GoFundMe is used to its full potential. The campaign has been shared on Facebook a staggering 25,000 times, and on Twitter nearly 3,000 times.'

As donations tipped £300,000 Miss Cutler said she was pleased so many people had donated to help Mr Barnes but said she felt she did not deserve any recognition or fundraising for herself.

'This is so incredibly kind but I really can't accept anything,' she said. 

'I have my full life to work and I can't help but feel that there are people out there who would really need it. I'm not in any hurry to get married too but honestly I don't deserve this.'

Miss Cutler and Mr Barnes had an emotional first meeting for the first time yesterday, at his sister's house in Newcastle on Tyne where he is staying because he is too afraid to return home.

The pensioner described meeting Miss Cutler as 'absolutely magic.'  

Mr Barnes, who measures just 4ft 6ins tall, is disabled and suffers from sight problems. He has been disabled since he was born after his mother contracted German measles while hse was pregnant. 

He had been putting the bins out when a man approached him, demanded money and then knocked him to the floor and rifled through his pockets.

Mr Barnes has been staying with his sister and her family since the attack - including his niece Georgi Galloway and great niece Florence Purvis

Finding nothing the man fled, leaving Mr Barnes on the concrete. The 67-year-old hauled himself to his neighbour's house and managed to phone his sister, and was taken to hospital. 

Miss Cutler's fundraising efforts have not only led to scores of donations, but people have also offered to work for free to help Mr Barnes and fit out his new house. 

Mr Barnes told BBC Breakfast: 'A solicitor from Gosforth has offered advice and I will just have to take it from there, but it will be put to good use.'

And Miss Cutler added: 'A full kitchen has been offered, a conservatory, a bathroom. There's an electrician, a tiler - you name it ... everything.' 

Mr Barnes, who is an excellent mathematician and popular with young people in the area, has promised to put the funds raised to good use and not splash out on luxury items.  

Police are asking anyone who lives in Hillside Place who may have CCTV to check footage for clues about the attacker. 

Witnesses are asked to contact police on 101, ext 69191, quoting log number 1180 25/01/15, or the Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
