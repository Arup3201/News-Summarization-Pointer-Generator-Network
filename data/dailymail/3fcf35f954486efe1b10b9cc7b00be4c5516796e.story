Celebrated: Napoleon Bonaparte will be commemorated with a new theme park to be built at the site of the Battle of Montereau - if funding can be secured

After almost 200 years, the last thing you would think the French want is a daily reminder of the devastating military defeats at Waterloo and Trafalgar.

But now a theme park is being planned in honour of Napoleon Bonaparte - and will stage daily re-enactments of the victories for Wellington and Nelson.

Dubbed 'Napoleonland', the attraction is likely to be built on the site of one of the military leader's most famous victories.

If funding is secured for the £180million park it is expected to create 3,000 jobs and could ultimately emerge as a rival to Disneyland.

There are plans to build it at the site where Napoleon defeated the Austrians in the Battle of Montereau in 1814 in Montereau-Fault-Yonne just south of Paris.

The six-day battle was the nation's last military victory over the Austrians.

The Battle of Waterloo, which put an end to Napoleon's rule in France, is expected to be recreated on a daily basis and visitors may even be able to take part in the reenactments.

They will also be able to take in a water show recreating the Battle of Trafalgar.

A museum, a hotel, shops, restaurants and a congress are all expected to be built at the park.

Planners are also hoping to recreate the killing of Louis XVI, France's last King, who died after being guillotined during the Revolution.

And in another attraction visitors may be able to ski around the bodies of soldiers and horses frozen on the battlefield.

Napoleon is the second most famous French and much-celebrated leader after Charles De Gaulle - so it remains to be seen how much room his countrymen give over to Lord Nelson's victory at the Battle of Trafalgar.

French politician Yves Jego, who is 
backing the project, hopes that construction work can get underway in 
2014 and the park open its doors in 2017.

It is expected to be based loosely on Asterix, a French theme park, and Puy du Fou a leisure park with Viking-themed attractions.

He is planning to unveil full details of what the attraction will contain on February 18 - the 198th anniversary of the Battle of Montereau.

Napoleon is well-known in Russia and China and it is hoped the attraction will bolster French tourism.

Despite being one of France's most decorated leaders, there is no national museum dedicated to Napoleon and Mr Jego said he hopes that it will help the military leader retain his place in the French national consciousness.

Charles Napoleon, who is a descendant of the military leader's brother, told The Times: 'There is a huge gulf between his celebrity abroad and the few important events about him in this country.'

Mr Jego added: 'As well as being an instrument of economic development, this is a question of rediscovering our roots and our history.

'We are going to combine historical truth with pure entertainment.'

He added that Napoelonland would be 'unbiased' and eschew the dominant French view that the military leader was a great man.

Local government officials are supporting the ambitious project and Mr Jego is searching for private sector investors to help fund the project.

It is hoped that the park would attract around 1.5million visitors in its first year.

Derided by the English as nothing more than a tyrant, a theme park will provide a very modern memorial to Napoleon Bonaparte.

Born in 1769, the celebrated leader seized power in a coup in 1799 and became first consul.

He defeated the Austrians at Marengo before negotiating peace on the continent in 1803 and establishing French dominance.

But it is the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 that he is remembered for in Britain. The British - led by Lord Nelson aboard HMS Victory - secured a decisive victory over a French and Spanish coalition.

Although the British officer secured a decisive victory he was shot dead while on deck.

Beaten by the Brits, Napoleon turned his attention back to the continent and secured arguably his, and France's, greatest military victory the same year.

In the Battle of Austerlitz the Russo-Austrian army were decisively defeated. The battle, fought in what is now the Czech Republic, saw the French gain a lot of new territory.

It was the Peninsular War, which began in 1808, with Portugal, Spain and the UK, which was ultimately to prove his undoing. After being defeated in a battle in Moscow in 1812, Paris fell in 1814 after a series of disastrous French defeats.

After going into exile, he regained power briefly in 1815 only to be defeated at the Battle of Waterloo. Following the Duke of Wellington's victory, Napoleon abdicated.

He was imprisoned by the British and died in custody in 1821.
