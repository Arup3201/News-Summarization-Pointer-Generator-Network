Neil Redfearn is proud of Leeds' history in the FA Cup and hopes he and his players can create some more at Sunderland on Sunday.

United's head coach grew up a Leeds fan and experienced the highs and lows of knockout football following his team in the competition.

He watched them beat Arsenal to win the 1972 final with an Allan Clarke goal, before they were denied back-to-back successes a year later when they were shocked by Sunderland in an all-time classic.

When Redfearn was growing up, Leeds were one of the powerhouses in English football. Nowadays, they are struggling in the lower echelons of the Championship table

The club has a very different feel about it now to then - owner Massimo Cellino has overseen a cosmopolitan overhaul that was unthinkable when Don Revie and his players were Wembley regulars - but Redfearn claims the club is still as focused on FA Cup glory as it was when he was idolising them on the television.

'It was a big day for us which would start at 10am with all the interviews and I would be glued to the telly,' the 49-year-old recalled. 'Being a Leeds fan and knowing about 1972 when we won against Arsenal, and then losing to Sunderland, they're the games that stick in your mind as a youngster.

'Obviously, the great players that Leeds had, Clarke, (Peter) Lorimer, (Billy) Bremner, these are people that have gone down in legendary history at Leeds United and they add to this romance that this football club has got with the FA Cup, so it's important that we go up to Sunderland give a good account of ourselves.'

Sunderland are Leeds' opponents on Sunday, and the two teams contested a famous final in 1973

Redfearn believes that Leeds' loss to Sunderland in 1973 will still be playing on some fans' minds

The sides have not met in the cup since that final 42 years ago, and such was Revie's impact at Leeds that Redfearn reckons revenge will still be on the mind of some connected with the club.

'I would have thought so, I would see it as that,' he said.

'I have to say there are a lot of people here that I have met in my seven years that are associated with the club that associate with the Revie ways.'

Leeds could field players from as many as nine different countries at the Stadium of Light - players who by Redfearn's own admission have struggled with the demands of the Championship, where a winless December has left the Whites in relegation trouble.

But the one-time semi-finalist with Oldham thinks his foreign legion know what it means to do well in the FA Cup.

'I think they do, the coverage of all aspects of football in this country is top notch and they see the FA Cup as being a prestigious tournament,' he said.

'They understand it and they understand at Leeds United it's important to win. When you enter a competition you enter it to win it and we're in it to win it.'

That is an ambitious claim considering Leeds' dreadful league form, with results leading to some reports suggesting Cellino is ready to sack a coach for the third time this season.

It is understood there is no immediate desire from the Italian to fire Redfearn and send him back to his old job with the academy, with the pair having spoken this week and finalised transfer targets, with Sassuolo striker Leonardo Pavoletti likely to be signed on loan.
