Syrian security forces tried to smuggle President Bashar Assad's family - including his British-born wife - out of the country.

Rebel forces claim Asma Assad, a graduate of King's College, London and a former investment banker, had tried to flee with her children.

They were in a convoy which was also carrying the president's mother and cousin. Sources told Egyptian newspaper 
Al-Masry-Al-Youm that 'a convoy of official vehicles was seen heading to
the airport in Damascus'.

The convoy was intercepted by brigades of army defectors and, coming under heavy fire, turned back to the city's presidential palace.

The claims come on the day that Syrian rebels blew up a key gas pipeline as violence against President Bashar Assad's regime continues to escalate and they inch closer to his Damascus seat of power.

Opposition forces blew up the line near Telkalakh, close to the Lebanese border, this morning - causing more than 460,000 cubic metres of gas to leak and cutting off supply to the city of Homs.

The attack is one of several since the Syrian uprising began in mid-March 2011 - and followed the killing of 61 people yesterday.

Street battles are now raging 'on the 
doorstep' of the capital, with activists saying today's death toll 
already stands at 15, as rebels advance to just three miles away from the 
beleaguered President's HQ.

Asma Assad, 36, (pictured) grew up in Acton, West London where she was known as 'Emma'.

She is the daughter of consultant cardiologist Fawaz Akhras and retired diplomat Sahar Otri, both Sunni Muslims, who moved from Syria to London in the Fifties so that her father, who is now based at the Cromwell Hospital and in Harley Street, could get the best possible education and medical training.

Asma, who holds dual citizenship, British and Syrian, was educated at a Church of England school in Ealing before attending a private girls’ day school - Queen’s College, Harley Street.

From Queen’s, where she achieved four A-levels, Asma went to King’s College London to read Computer Science and take a diploma in French Literature.

She graduated with a First and, after six months of travelling, joined Deutsche Bank as an analyst in hedge-fund management.

She then moved to the investment bank JP Morgan and worked in Paris and New York, as well as London. On family holidays back in Syria, she met Bashar.

Then he, too, came to London to study ophthalmology, though he had to leave early to return to Syria after his elder brother Basil, who had been the heir, died in a car crash.

Asma started seeing him in secret, resigning from JP Morgan just a month before the wedding without being able to explain the real reason. With her father, she has set up several London-based charities such as the Syria Heritage.

Vogue has described her as ‘the freshest and most magnetic of first ladies’ and has topped French Elle’s ‘most stylish woman in politics’ list.

In Damascus, Bashar and Asma now live in a flat with plate-glass windows and their three boys go to a Montessori school.

Asma speaks four languages and her connections with France have led her to persuade the Louvre to help her open Syrian cultural attractions.

To counter that advance, more than 2,000 Syrian troops, driving 50 tanks and dozens of armoured vehicles, stormed rebel areas near Damascus yesterday, shelling neighbourhoods under control of army dissidents.

Cowering from mortars and machine guns, terrified families were sent fleeing on foot carrying bags of
their belongings.

Suburbs and villages on 
the eastern outskirts of the city, a
predominantly Sunni Muslim agricultural area known as al Ghouta where large anti-regime 
protests have been held, were hit.

Ein Tarma, just three miles away from the capital, was also targeted. The wide-scale offensive suggests Assad's regime is worried military defectors are closing in on the capital.

Damascus has so far remained relatively quiet, while most other Syrian cities descended into chaos. 

Rebels have gradually inched closer 
and closer to the capital over the past two weeks.

Army dissidents have 
become more visible, seizing several suburbs on the eastern edge of the 
city.

They have also set up
checkpoints where masked men wearing military uniform and wielding 
assault rifles stop motorists and protect anti-regime protests.

Observers say their presence so close to 
the capital suggests the Assad regime may either be losing control or 
setting up a trap for the fighters before going on the offensive.

Ammar
Abdulhamid, a US-based Syrian dissident, wrote on his blog: 'The 
current battles taking place in and around Damascus may not yet lead to 
the unravelling of the regime.

'But
the illusion of normalcy that the Assads have sought hard to maintain 
in the capital since the beginning of the revolution has surely 
unravelled.

'Once illusions unravel, reality soon follows.'

Rami
Abdul-Rahman, director of the British-based Syrian Observatory for 
Human Rights, who relies on a network of activists on the ground, said: 
'There are heavy clashes going on in all of the Damascus suburbs.

'Troops were able to enter some areas but are still facing stiff resistance in others.'

The latest increase in violence came as 
Britain pushed for agreement on a United Nations deadline for 
beleaguered Assad to step down in two weeks and end the bloodshed that 
is tearing his country apart.

The U.N. Security Council may vote as 
soon as Wednesday on the resolution for Assad to hand over power to his 
deputy and make way for a national unity government.

Uprising: This image grab also shows the demonstration in Helfaya. Some 5,000 are reported to have been killed in clashes between rebels and government forces since the uprising began

British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant said there was ‘very strong support’ for the move.

But Russia and China – which issued a rare double-veto of a similar, slightly weaker resolution last October – have so far resisted any attempts to intervene in Syria.

Up against it: Syrian President Bashar Assad could be offered a deal to step down to help end the uprising that has rocked the country for the past ten months and left 5,000 dead

The deaths over the weekend came the day after the Arab League suspended its monitoring mission in Syria because of the mounting violence.

The Arab League’s recommendations, 
which fall short of urging military intervention, form the basis of the 
U.N. draft resolution introduced by Morocco.

The
next step is a meeting of experts from the missions of the 15 countries
on the Security Council this afternoon. The draft gives Syria 15 days 
to comply or risk the adoption of tougher measures.

Britain,
along with France and Germany, are hoping that a briefing tomorrow 
about the Arab League’s findings by Secretary-General Nabil el-Araby and
Qatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani will help 
convince the Russians not to use their veto.

Russia’s
U.N. envoy Vitaly Churkin said he couldn’t see the resolution being 
passed as it stood, but added that negotiations would continue down to 
the wire.

More than 5,000 people have been killed since the Syrian regime began cracking down on protests ten months ago.

Street fighting: Smoke rises from the suburb of Erbeen in Damascus yesterday. Around 2,000 Syrian troops backed by tanks launched an assault to retake Damascus suburbs from rebels on Sunday, activists said

Battle: Government soldiers are reported to have killed 19 rebels in street battles in the capital as they struggle to retake suburbs from the anti-regime forces
