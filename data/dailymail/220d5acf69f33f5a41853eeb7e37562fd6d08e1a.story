An Iraq War veteran accused of jumping a fence at the White House pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges that he ran into the presidential mansion while carrying a knife.

A lawyer for defendant Omar Gonzalez, David Bos, entered the plea on his client's behalf in a 20-minute proceeding that grew contentious because of a disagreement between Bos and US Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson.

Wearing a standard prison-issue orange jump suit, Gonzalez sat attentively at the defense table but did not address the court.

Robinson wants Gonzalez to undergo a forensic screening to determine whether he is competent to stand trial. 

Bos opposed that, telling reporters he does not want to provide the government with an extensive amount of information about his client that would be revealed by a forensic screening.

Bos said Gonzalez is competent to stand trial, an assertion that marked the start of a dispute over whether Gonzalez will have to undergo the screening.

Relatives have insisted that Gonzalez, who served three tours of duty in Iraq, suffers from post traumatic stress disorder. He retired in 2012 after losing part of his foot in an IED explosion. 

A three-count federal grand jury indictment issued Tuesday accuses Gonzalez of unlawfully entering a restricted building while carrying a deadly weapon, a federal charge.

He also was indicted in the September 19 incident on two violations of District of Columbia law — carrying a dangerous weapon outside a home or business and unlawful possession of ammunition.

Following Gonzalez's arrest, investigators recovered more than 800 rounds of ammunition, a machete and two hatchets in his car. 

The indictment said the ammunition consisted of eight types, including 12 gauge shotgun shells and .45 caliber rounds.

The judge handling the case will be US District Judge Rosemary Collyer, who was nominated for the post in the first term of President George W. Bush.

Omar Gonzalez, of Copperas Cove, Texas, was captured inside the White House September 19 with a knife after he jumped the fence on the north side of the presidential mansion, ran past five rings of security, burst through the front door after overpowering a Secret Service officer and ran about 130 feet into the East Room, used for events and receptions. 

According to a report by The Washington Post, Gonzalez was able to single-handle elude a plainclothes surveillance team outside the gates; a Secret Service officer in a guard booth on the North Lawn; a Belgian Malinois attack dog, and a guard standing on the door of the White House.

The incident occurred shortly after 7pm, only minutes after Obama and his daughters, along with a guest of one of the girls, left the White House aboard Marine One on their way to Camp David. 

At a congressional hearing Tuesday on the breach, lawmakers asked Secret Service Director Julia Pierson how Gonzalez escaped greater scrutiny.

In July, he was arrested in Virginia for reckless driving, eluding police and possessing a sawed-off shotgun.

In August, he was stopped, but not arrested, while walking along the south fence of the White House with a hatchet in his waistband.

Ousted: US Secret Service Director Julia Pierson (C), pictured during a Congressional hearing Tuesday about the security breach, submitted her resignation Wednesday 

On Wednesday afternoon,  Pierson resigned in the face of multiple revelations about bumbling in her agency and rapidly eroding confidence that the president and his family were being kept safe.

President Barack Obama 'concluded new leadership of that agency was required,' said White House spokesman Josh Earnest.
