A traffic warden has been caught on film apparently refusing to ticket a car parked on double yellow lines - and eventually admits that it's because it belongs to his own boss.

The warden, who was on patrol in Swansea, South Wales, was confronted by an indignant member of the public who noticed that one car had escaped punishment.

Steve McMillan, who filmed the encounter on his phone, asked the warden repeatedly why he had refused to ticket the car, to which the flustered official replied that he was acting on his 'discretion'.

'My discretion': A parking attendant in Swansea is confronted over his decision not to ticket a car - and it eventually emerges it belongs to his boss

When pressed on the matter by Mr McMillan - who insisted he had no such right to refuse the ticket - the warden insisted that he did.

Eventually another warden entered the fray, and revealed another reason the ticket was allegedly withheld, saying 'That's my boss's car'.

A second video filmed by Mr McMillan then shows the man in question - Swansea Parking Services Deputy Manager Steve Sheriff - entering the argument.

'On business': A second warden, left, later points out that the car belongs to his boss Steve Sheriff, right, who then arrives and attempts to defend himself

The suited man - who identifies himself as Mr Sheriff when asked - attempts to explain that he is parking there for business reasons, which Mr McMillan tells him is not a valid reason.

He initially compares himself to the police - who are allowed to disregard parking laws in certain circumstances - but later gives up on the line of argument.

When asked whether his logic applied to anybody who has business reasons for parking on double yellow lines, Mr Sheriff does not give a clear answer, but seems to leave the confrontation seemingly without a ticket.

Swansea City Council was not available to comment.

PART ONE: CONFRONTATION AND WRIGGLING FROM THE PARKING ATTENDANT

Steve McMillan: How come you just allowed somebody to park on double yellow lines?

Warden 1: I've got discretion... That's for me to know... it's privileged information, sir.. I'm allowed to give discretion for people.

Mr McMillan: I disagree, sir, because that's not fair... We're all equal people, you have no right to leave that vehicle parked there.

PART TWO: THE TRUTH EMERGES

Mr McMillan: I'm just asking the question - how come you've allowed that car to park there for more than five minutes on double yellows and then walked away from the situation?

Warden 2: What? That car there? That's my boss's car.

Mr McMillan: It doesn't matter whether it's your boss's car, does it?

Warden 2: I think you'd better go speak to him yourself, sir.

PART THREE: 'I'M ON BUSINESS'

Mr McMillan: How come you're allowed to park on double yellow lines for more than five minutes?

Mr Sheriff: I'm actually on business at the moment.

Mr McMillan: That doesn't matter... Why is it fair for you to park on business and not me?

Mr Sheriff: It depends on what you're doing.

Mr McMillan: But no, it doesn't.

PART FOUR: THE ADMISSION

Mr Sheriff: All right, I shouldn't have really parked there.

Mr McMillan: I just don't think that's fair.

PART FIVE: THE LAST-DITCH ATTEMPT

Warden 1: I'm using my discretion.

Mr McMillan: You're not a police officer, sir, you have a job to follow and if you're not doing it and booking this car you're in breach of your own rules and regulations.

PART SIX: THE COUP DE GRACE

Mr McMillan: Police have discretion, they are allowed to park on double yellow lines if they have blue lights on. Do you have blue lights on top of this vehicle?

Mr Sheriff: No.

Mr McMillan: Are you a police officer?

Mr Sheriff: No.

Mr McMillan: You're a manager who's high up within the parking industry. I think it's despicable.
