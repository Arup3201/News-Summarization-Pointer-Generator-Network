Wasps director of rugby Dai Young has told his players to sign-off with a memorable performance in their last ever game at Adams Park on Sunday.

This weekend’s Champions Cup tie against Castres will signal the end of a 12-year stay in High Wycombe, before the club relocate to Coventry’s Ricoh Arena.

It will be an afternoon of mixed emotion for Young, who says he was left with a ‘move or die’ predicament when the controversial relocation was signed off.

Wasps will sign off from their old ground against Castres, who they beat in the Champions Cup last week

The club have been at Adams Park for the past 12 years, and will now play their games in Coventry

‘Everyone will feel a responsibility to make sure we sign-off in the right way,’ said Young. ‘We want to finish with a bit of a smile on our face and we’re very mindful that we need to put up a performance. 

'We want a display to say “Thank You” for the support, but we don’t want it to be “tara” and “goodbye”.

‘Hopefully a lot of the fans will follow us. We have enjoyed our years there but we haven’t had many good memories over the last few seasons. 

'A lot of the emotion is tempered by the excitement of moving on to the Ricoh Arena. We’re moving onto an era that can give us a platform to compete with the best again.’
