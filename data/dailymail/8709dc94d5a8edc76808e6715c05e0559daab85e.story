David Cameron has claimed a seven pence bulldog clip on his expenses, along with 26p for 'banner bar tags' and 38p for a staple remover despite earning £142,500-a-year.

Processing the claim for the paper clip costs six times as much as its own value, and the claim for the banner tags will also have cost the Government more than it recouped for the PM.

According to the latest figures from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) Cameron has made a total of 72 claims since April last year, totalling £1,790.

Ipsa’s annual running costs are £6million and it processes about 210,000 claims a year, making the average cost of processing a single claim 28.6p.

The new claims also include £577 for legal expenses insurance, £234.32 for food and drink for work experience students, and £28 on a taxi.

Cameron has a past record of claiming small amounts on stationary, asking for 14 pence for  more bulldog clips and 17 pence for staples in early 2013.

Cameron, who is paid £142,500-a-year, also claimed £577 for legal insurance and £28 for a taxi

Ipsa was set up following the MP's expenses scandal five years ago, and at the time Cameron said the commons had been 'deeply mired' in the revelations.

Cameron himself repaid £937 in expenses, including £680 for repair work at his home address.

At the time he said: 'I don’t care if they were within the rules. They were wrong. I want to say sorry it’s come to this and sorry for the actions of some Tory MPs.'

The PM is estimated to be worth £4million and has inherited £300,000 from his stockbroker father.
