One in five ‘suicide tourists’ going to Switzerland to end their lives is British, say experts.

A new study found a doubling of the number of people of all nationalities travelling to Dignitas, an organisation founded in 1998 to help people with terminal and incurable illnesses end their own lives.

Britons make up the second highest number of foreigners going to Zurich for assisted suicide between 2008 and 2012 – exceeded only by Germans.

While euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal in the UK, other countries, like Switzerland, do permit assisted suicide in specific circumstances - and Dignitas is one of the few to accept foreigners.

Academics from Zurich University behind the study argue that other countries have changed the law, or at least had a serious debate about the issues, as a result of the rise in suicide tourism.

However, British experts claim there has been little impact in the UK despite increasing numbers seeking help to die abroad.

The Zurich Institute of Legal Medicine produced data on 611 cases of assisted suicide of non-Swiss people from 31 countries around the world during the five year period.

The highest number was 268 Germans followed by 126 Britons – making two thirds of the total.

The study, published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, found in 2008 there were 123 cases of suicide tourism.

This dipped to 86 cases in 2009 and increased steadily to 2012 when it reached 172 cases.

Overall, 58.5 per cent of cases were women and the average age of those using these services was 69 - although the range was from 23 years to 97.

There are six ‘right to die’ organisations operating in Switzerland offering assisted suicide to their members providing they meet certain criteria.

Four of these bodies offer services to foreign nationals, including people from the UK.

These organisations deal with around 600 cases of suicide each year, some 150 to 200 of which are suicide tourists, the researchers found.

Most cases of suicide tourism used Dignitas which charges between 9,000 to 10,500 Swiss francs (about £6,000 to £7,000) for assisting suicide, says the study.

Neurological diseases including paralysis, motor neurone disease, Parkinson’s, and multiple sclerosis were the most common reasons for assisted suicide - accounting for almost half of cases.

Dr Charles Foster, of Green Templeton College at Oxford University, in a commentary in the journal, said there may be growing public acknowledgement of something ‘intellectually, if not morally uncomfortable, about getting another country to do your dirty work’.

But, he said, this was not a reason for changing English law on assisted suicide.

In the House of Lords, when he presented the Assisted Dying Bill, Lord Falconer said ‘The current situation leaves the rich able to go to Switzerland, the majority reliant on amateur assistance, the compassionate treated like criminals.

‘It is time for a change in the law but only a very limited and safeguarded change.

‘It would not lead to more death but to less suffering.’

The second reading of the Bill, which would offer the chance of assisted dying to terminally ill patients deemed mentally capable and within six months of likely death, took place in July and is to be moved to the next Parliamentary stage - the committee stage - at a date yet to be set.

Other countries in the top 10 between 2008 and 2012 were France with 66 cases, Italy 44, USA 21, Austria 14, Canada 12, Spain and Israel (eight each).
