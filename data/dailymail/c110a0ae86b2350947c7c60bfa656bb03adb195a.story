Royal Mail unveiled a big jump in profits to £440million today as it took another step towards privatisation and a £3billion stock market flotation later this year.

The result for the year to March 31 is more than double the £152million in 2012 as the state-owned firm benefited from the boom in online shopping and recent efforts to modernise the business, which included offloading £37.5billion in pensions liabilities to the Government.

Chief executive Moya Greene, who last year returned the core postal business to profitability after four successive years of losses, said it was a strong performance and that the transformation of Royal Mail was under way.

Profits boom: Royal Mail is expected to announce a surplus of between £300million and £400million this week.

The core postal business, which 
delivers the six-days-a-week universal service to 29million addresses, 
reported operating profits of £331million and improved its margin from 
0.5 per cent to 3.9 per cent. Parcel deliveries now account for almost 
half of the group's revenues of £9.3billion in the last year.

The performance is expected to 
encourage the Government to cash in on the turnaround by pressing ahead 
with a privatisation this year, despite opposition from unions 
representing postal workers and managers.

Business Secretary Vince Cable today 
insisted there was ‘no alternative’ to privatising the Royal Mail and 
said the organisation still faces a ‘fundamental threat’ from email that
meant it must be reformed in order to survive.

However, unions warned services will go into decline if the business is sold off.

It comes after a decade of 
cost-cutting which has seen employee numbers at the Royal Mail Group 
fall by around 50,000 to 150,000.

In its half-year results in November,
Royal Mail reported that its UK parcel revenues were up by 13 per cent,
with parcels representing 47 per cent of total group revenue.

Revenue
from letters was 2 per cent higher following an increase in stamp 
prices earlier in the year, although letter volumes fell by 9 per cent.

The
amount of junk mail also increased, accounting for around half the 
daily postbag.

The daily UK mailbag fell by four million over the year 
to 54 million items.

Ms Greene said at the time that Royal Mail was climbing out of a 'very deep hole', with all parts of the business profitable.

The preferred sell off option is believed to 
involve the public buying shares alongside City investors, in an echo of
the ‘Tell Sid’ campaign that pioneered the public sale of shares in 
British Gas in the 1980s.

At least 10 per cent of the shares 
have been earmarked for the workforce, although it is not known whether 
staff will get them for free.

The Communication Workers Union will this week start balloting Royal Mail workers on whether to boycott 
the post of rival companies in a move which could lead to millions of 
items being left undelivered.

Around 120,000 members of the CWU will vote from tomorrow, with the result due on June 19.

Private mail makes up 44 per cent of 
the daily post bag, so a boycott would leave 26million items undelivered
each day, including energy bills, statements, and business mail 
contracts won by companies including TNT and UK Mail.

The ballot will also gauge opposition 
to the plans to privatise Royal Mail and backing for a campaign of 
refusing to co-operate with new efficiency measures.

Dave Ward, CWU deputy general 
secretary, said today's results offered more evidence that Royal Mail 
should be kept in the public sector.

He added: ‘Improved productivity and 
modernisation has played a role in these good results. Privatisation 
isn't necessary and it would destabilise the workforce and the good 
progress being made. The support of the workforce is crucial to the 
success of the company.

‘Price rises have also clearly played a
role in the rise in profits. Fattening the goose in the short term may 
lead to volume decline as customers seek alternatives. One thing's 
clear, under privatisation prices would rise further and services would 
be hit as private companies operate for profit, not for people.’
