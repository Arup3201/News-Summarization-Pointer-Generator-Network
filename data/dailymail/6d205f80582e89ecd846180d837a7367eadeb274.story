We're more used to seeing him scaling cliff faces dressed in a tuxedo or emerging half-naked from the sea in just a pair of pale blue trunks.

But Daniel Craig left the Twittersphere more than just a little shaken and stirred when he turned up to launch of the new James Bond film - wearing a 'Christmas' knitted jumper.

The usually-stylish actor donned the navy blue crew-neck as he marked the start of the production of Spectre, the  24th installment of the 007 film empire.

Daniel Craig caused a stir yesterday when he turned up to the Spectre launch wearing a blue knitted jumper

The usually-stylish actor, pictured with Lea Sedoux and Monica Belluci, paired the 'grandad' jumper with grey slacks and a white shirt - much to the dismay of his fans 

And, if that wasn't enough, the actor decided to pair the 'sensible' jumper with grey trousers, a white shirt and a plain pair of black shoes - setting pulses racing for all the wrong reasons. 

Despite the excitement surrounding the much-anticipated event, it wasn't long before the questionable ensemble was the talk of the launch, sending Twitter into meltdown.

Mark Machado swiftly announced: 'Daniel Craig has officially opened Christmas jumper season'.  

After that, there were a flurry of concerned tweets about Craig's new look.

One user, Montynero, was baffled that the actor had rocked up to the event 'in a Dad jumper looking like a drunk supply teacher'.

While Shirley Lemon wrote: 'Love James Bond. Love Daniel Craig. Love the new title: Spectre. But don't want to see Bond in his sensible jumper.'

Another user explained that the cold weather was 'no excuse' for the knitwear, writing: 'I know it's a bit chilly today but that's no escuse for Daniel Craig to wear such a grandad jumper.'

It wasn't long before a spoof image of Daniel Craig sporting a Christmas jumper was sweeping the internet

Bond fans took to Twitter to express their dismay at Mr Craig's choice of 'grandad' jumper 

And Dan Cooper described the look as similar to 'an accountant at a fancy dress ball'.

As one Twitter user pointed out, the jumper 'wasn't even a V-neck'. 

The jumper caused such a stir that one Photoshop-savvy user took it upon themselves to superimpose a reindeer onto Craig's top, in a spoof 'Christmas jumper' image which swept the internet.

But for others, the outfit was a welcome change from the swanky suits for which James Bond is well-known. 

Kathy Keown tweeted that the jumper gave her 'hope that Spectre's costuming aesthetic will be mainly knitwear'.

And Ismail Mulla thought Craig still looked the part, stating that he 'could make a tartan apron look cool'.

The new film features a stellar line-up and is being directed by Sam Mendes (fourth from left) 

Another user Daniel Blythe took comfort from the fact that, for once in his life, he was 'as stylish as James Bond'. 

The title of the new film, directed by Brit movie maker Sam Mendes, revolves around the Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism and Revenge and Extortion. 

Spectre is led by iconic evil genius Ernst Blofeld, the super-villain from the Dr No and Thunderball movies. 

But some 007 fans were rather taken by the actor's outfit, with several saying that he pulled it off in usual Daniel Craig style 

The film, which is due for general release on 6 November 2015, will feature Oscar-winning star Christoph Waltz, Moriarty actor Andrew Scott, Italian star Monica Bellucci and French actress Lea Seydoux alongside Craig.  

It has taken its title from the shadowy terrorist organisation created by Bond author Ian Fleming which first appeared in his novel Thunderball.

Locations for the new film will include London, Mexico City, Rome, Morocco's Tangier and Erfoud, as well as Solden in Austria, which promises to see Bond returning to the ski slopes.

'All of them are amazing places. I'm very excited to be going to these locations over seven months, which is how long we'll be shooting,' said Mendes.

Announcing the production, film-makers said of the plot: 'A cryptic message from Bond's past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organisation.

'While M battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind Spectre.'
