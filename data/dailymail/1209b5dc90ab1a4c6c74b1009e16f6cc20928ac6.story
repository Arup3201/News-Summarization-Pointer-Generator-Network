Police should help identify high-profile suspects to end inaccurate speculation on the internet, the Government's top lawmaker said last night.

It would be 'very sensible' in some cases for forces to confirm to the Press who they have arrested, said Attorney General Dominic Grieve.

He added that police have the 'discretion' to reveal the identity of suspects, but warned journalists not to launch 'fishing expeditions'.

Attorney General Dominic Grieve has said it would be 'very sensible' in some cases for forces to confirm to the Press who they have arrested

His comments come after Scotland Yard made yet another arrest as part of Operation Yewtree, which was launched following the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal.

Dozens of Twitter users inaccurately named the 72-year-old suspect as various celebrities, including a veteran pop star and a businessman.

However, sources said the latest arrest – the 13th since the inquiry began – was not a well-known figure.

Mr Grieve said: 'Clearly, if the Press have got to know who somebody is who's been arrested and are publicising that, then clearly it might be very sensible for the police to confirm that fact.

'But equally, I don't think we should end up with a process in which the police are being subjected to fishing expeditions with dozens of names being reeled out to them and an obligation to pick one of them. That seems to me to be a matter which must be within the discretion of the police.'

Asked if he was concerned that well-known figures could be inaccurately named on social media, Mr Grieve said 'public interest' could free the police to say the wrong person is in the spotlight. 'Under certain circumstances that might be a good reason why the person under arrest should have their name publicised,' he added.

He also highlighted the 'odd' situation in which the names of suspects are widely known to the public, but only confirmed by police days later.

For instance, the identities of the two suspects in the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby were reported worldwide – but it was up to ten days before Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale were named by the Met.

The Attorney General is the latest senior Government figure to step into the row over new police guidelines that promote a policy of 'secret arrests'.

Following the Leveson report, forces have been told to identify suspects only when it is in the 'public interest' or when it could help prevent or detect crime.

Alex Marshall of the College of Policing said the guidance aims to 'strike the correct balance' between privacy and 'open and honest' relations with the media.
