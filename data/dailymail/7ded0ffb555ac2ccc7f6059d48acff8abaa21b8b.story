Maria Miller has risked angering Spain by praising the Gibraltar football team who played their first match as a member of Uefa last week

Diplomatic tensions between Britain and Spain were ratcheted up last night after a Cabinet Minister pledged to boost Gibraltar’s ambitions on the world sporting stage.  

Culture Secretary Maria Miller taunted Spain by hailing a ‘historic’ match played by Gibraltar’s football team last week, after they were accepted by Uefa, European football’s governing body, and given the chance to compete in an international tournament for the first time.

Ms Miller’s provocative intervention comes after the Spanish mounted a doomed attempt to stop the friendly match against Slovakia – which ended in a 0-0 draw – by arguing the Rock was not a sovereign state.

The Minister is now promising to help other Gibraltan teams to compete in international fixtures – a move designed to incense the Spanish.

Ms Miller, congratulating the Gibraltar Football Association, said: ‘I know it has been challenging for you to get to this point, with the odds seemingly stacked against you, but your tenacity has paid off and the results have made every resident of Gibraltar proud.’  

In a letter to Desmond Reoch, the association’s president, Ms Miller said: ‘A draw against Slovakia is a highly creditable result, given this was a team that qualified for the last World Cup, and it certainly augurs well for the future.’

Gibraltar will launch their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign next year.

The letter, which has been seen by The Mail on Sunday, goes on defiantly: ‘We are, as you will know, keen to support Gibraltar’s international ambitions.

'In other sports Gibraltar is struggling to get the international recognition it seeks and deserves, in part because of the approach, attitude and actions of European nations.

‘It goes without saying I unreservedly back you and Gibraltar’s case for recognition, whether that is in football, rugby union or in other sports.’

The match ended in a 0-0 draw which Miller said should make 'every resident of Gibraltar proud'

The letter concludes: ‘I look forward to the first match between Gibraltar and one of the home nations.’    

Her intervention is likely to be more significant in the political than the sporting sphere. Gibraltar has one full-sized football pitch, and the game had to be played 150 miles away in southern Portugal – cheered on by about 500 fans in the 30,000-capacity Estadio Algarve – because their stadium does not meet Uefa standards.

With a population of just 30,000, Gibraltar replaces San Marino (32,000) as the smallest nation to be accepted by Uefa.

In Tuesday’s game, the team of amateurs was boosted by the inclusion of ex-Manchester United professional Danny Higginbotham, whose grandmother came from the Rock.

Ms Miller’s move comes amid a growing war of words between London and Madrid over the Rock, which Spain ceded to Britain in 1713. Gibraltar and Spain will be kept apart in any qualifying football competitions.
