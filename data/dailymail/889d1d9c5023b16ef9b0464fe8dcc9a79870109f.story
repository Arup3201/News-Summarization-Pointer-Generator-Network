Dangerous: Andrew Van Horne, nicknamed 'Heineken' because of his love of lager, mowed down two party-goers in his friend's car after being thrown out of the event

A driver was jailed for 10 years today for deliberately mowing down two people with a car as revenge for being thrown out of a Christmas party.

Andrew Van Horne, nicknamed 'Heineken' because of his love of lager, used a friend's VW Bora as a weapon and drove so fast that he left one of his victims crippled for life.

Van Horne, 41, carried out the dangerous manoeuvre after 'losing face' when he was ejected from the party following a row over a spilt drink.

As guests were helping clean up outside the house at the end of the party, Van Horne began revving the car and drove towards three of them.

Carl Rock, 47, a painter and decorator, broke both legs as the car pinned him against the lounge wall of the house.

He has been told he may lose one or both of his legs because his injuries were so severe, and he may need a wheelchair.

Another party guest, Claudine Henry, was also hit by the car but escaped with only cuts and bruises after Mr Rock managed to push her out of the way as the vehicle ploughed into him.

Van Horne's intended target, the party's host Owen Irving, avoided the car, but the crash caused damage to the house costing £15,000 to repair.

Manchester Crown Court heard today that the incident happened after a party in the Moss Side area of the city which was attended by up to 30 people on Boxing Day last year.

During the party, an argument broke out after Van Horne, who had been drinking, accidentally spilt a drink over Mr Irving.

Barrie Darby, prosecuting, told the court that Van Horne suddenly produced a knife and was thrown out but Mr Irving later spotted him lurking across the road in front of his car.

As the party ended Mr Irving, Mr Rock and Ms Henry were tidying up outside when they heard a revving of a car and saw Van Horne driving at them.

Sentencing: Van Horne was jailed for 10 years by a judge at Manchester Crown Court after being convicted at a previous hearing of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, attempted wounding with intent and assault occasioning actual bodily harm

Mr Darby said: 'The vehicle hit Rock, Henry and narrowly missed Irving.

'The vehicle then hit the house causing the front wall of the property to rupture and causes a hole in the wall of the house.'

Van Horne, a father of two, managed to drive away before dumping the vehicle.

He was traced after the registered owner of the car said he had lent it to him.

Mr Darby said Mr Rock spent over two months in hospital but due to the severe nature of his injuries it was 'unlikely' that Mr Rock would ever walk normally again.

In mitigation, defence counsel Mr Chudi Grant: 'This was not a pre-meditated assault, there was a short background to this where matters progressed, he has not gone out looking for trouble.'

But Judge Michael Henshell, sentencing, told Van Horne: 'You were clearly in a bad mood after you were asked to leave the party.

'You clearly lost your temper and you went to a car which was parked on the opposite side of the house.

'There were a number of people outside tidying outside the property. They had nothing whatsoever to do with what had happened inside.

'You drove the car across the road and performed a U turn, aiming towards Mr Irving who was outside the house in between two vehicles.

'He was just out of the way and you collided with a van and between the van and the car Mr Rock was there.

'Damage to the front of the house is evidence of the force of the impact.'

The judge said that Mr Rock, a father of three, would never return to work, needed crutches and may even require a wheelchair.

'His life has been affected in the most dramatic manner all because of your driving,' the judge continued.

'You used the car as a weapon to drive across the road towards people in that short space of time while intending to cause harm to Mr Irving.

'I’m sure you realise you could have killed someone. You were in a foul temper when seeking revenge or retaliation on Mr Irving.'

Van Horne was convicted at a previous hearing of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, attempted wounding with intent and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

In addition to his prison sentence, he was banned from driving for eight years.

Outside court, Detective Constable Ian Wrench, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Van Horne left an absolute trail of devastation behind him that night - all over a spilt drink.

'Clearly his ego is so fragile that he could not take being ejected from a party and responded in the only way he could think of with shocking and totally unnecessary violence.

'His damaged pride resulted in one man suffering truly horrific and life-changing injuries.'
