The man who famously put aside his Big Mac to help rescue three women held captive in a Cleveland house for more than a decade has published his memoir.

Charles Ramsey took to Reddit to answer questions about the moment of bravery which turned him into a local hero and propelled him into the national spotlight. He has written a book about his life before and after last year's extraordinary events, Dead Giveaway.

Mr Ramsey told fans during an online Q&A session on Tuesday that he sees Michelle Knight several nights of the week in his Cleveland neighborhood while she walks her dog.

Charles Ramsey has published his memoirs Dead Giveaway this week - an account of his life before, during and after the dramatic rescue of three kidnapped women in Cleveland, Ohio on May 6, 2013

One Reddit user asked Mr Ramsey if he kept in touch with the women he rescued on May 6 last year - Amanda Berry, along with her six-year-old daughter who was born in captivity, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight.

He responded: 'I see Michelle 
Knight several nights a week. Her thing is to walk her dog and meet and 
greet people. My thing is to walk around looking for bad dudes who want 
to snatch another child.'

He said that Ms Knight was catching up with technology after spending 11 years locked up in Ariel Castro's house of horrors. Mr Ramsey also told users that Ms Knight had been working with TV psychologist Dr Phil.

'Michelle has a tablet. They keep her up to date
 with things. She's with Dr. Phil's camp,' he wrote on the Reddit feed.

'She's getting emails, 
responding to them. Knows how to download apps. She's actually created 
music she wants to produce some day.'

Ramsey, 44, who had been working as a dishwasher, described in his book how an ordinary Monday last May took an extraordinary turn.

Mr Ramsey writes that morning he rose early and was collecting his mail when he found a letter for Ariel Castro, his next-door neighbor, mixed in with his pile.

He walked down to hand it to Castro, who was standing outside his home, getting ready to leave for work.

Mr Ramsey wrote: 'Ariel Castro seemed like a normal, regular good neighbor. He pretty much kept to himself, but when we saw each other we always said hi. He would often barbeque in his back yard and we’d share some ribs, pork chops, burgers, and chicken.'

Castro would often have a little girl at his cookouts, who Mr Ramsey believed to be his granddaughter.

Mr Ramsey said on Reddit on Tuesday that, with hindsight, Castro was doing everything to keep people from asking about his house.

He wrote that later that same day around 5pm, he walked over for his beloved Big Mac meal from a local McDonald's. Arriving home, he sat down on the porch to enjoy his Big Mac and fries when he heard a loud banging from the house next door and a woman scream: 'Somebody help!'

Along with another man, Mr Ramsey ran
 to the front door of Ariel Castro's home where the noise was coming 
from. Asking the man to 'watch his back', Mr Ramsey ran up onto 
Castro's porch and saw what he described as a 'young,
 attractive white woman, wearing a white tank top, clutching a child, 
lodged behind the storm door, banging and screaming'.

Mr Ramsey said he was stunned by the sight of the woman, having believed that Castro lived alone.

The
 woman, who later would be known as missing Amanda Berry, had managed to
 squeeze her left arm out of the gap from where she was trapped behind 
the door.

Mr Ramsey said that the door was locked from the inside and was holding firm.

He then told Miss Berry: 'Get the f*** back, b****.... I'm gonna kick the door in.'

Ramsey’s expletive-ridden 911 call and 
his colorful account of setting aside his McDonald’s food to help went 
viral, while a CNN interview he gave was turned into a song by the 
Gregory Brothers called Dead Giveaway - which he used as the title of his book.

Ramsey was flown first-class with his friends to New York City last May for an interview on NightLine. While waiting for their plane, Mr Ramsey received a call from the White House.

He wrote that a cabinet secretary who works for President Obama called to pass on a message.

Mr Ramsey was a little disappointed, he recalled, asking: 'Dis ain’t Barack?'

The secretary responded: 'No, Mr. Ramsey. The president has seen on the news what you did. He’s very grateful for what you did for those girls.'

Mr Ramsey answered: 'Uh, thanks. Just did what I had to do, bro.'

His
 heroic actions turned Mr Ramsey into an instant celebrity and indeed, on the Reddit thread, many of the 
commentors thanked him for his bravery.

A
 local hamburger chain in Cleveland gave him a year of free hamburgers. 
He told Reddit users on Tuesday that the chain had actually given him $2,000 in gift 
cards for food which he handed out to the homeless.

Mr
 Ramsey told Reddit fans that comedian Drew Carey, who is also from
 Cleveland, gave him good advice about fame - and how to think of it 
like the theme song from Cheers.

He wrote: 'Sing
 that jungle in your head and when it starts making sense to you, it 
won't bother you anymore.

'The world is your neighborhood now. You're in 
their heart, you're in their brains.'

Mr Ramsey was also asked on Reddit how life had changed for him after the events of last year.

He
 said : 'Life has changed because I thought I was a good judge of 
character. I'm 44. You figure there is no way in the hell you could not 
see something demonic seven inches away from where you lay your head.

'What's stayed the same? My sanity.'

He also admitted in the online Q&A that he would have killed Castro if he had the opportunity, writing on Reddit: 'That b****** got over on me. I should have killed him a long time ago.'

He told one Reddit user, who asked what he would have done differently last year, that he would have got Castro 'pregnant five times and beat the babies out of him '.

Following his book tour, Mr Ramsey plans to work on a campaign in Cleveland that demolishes abandoned buildings and houses.

He wrote on Tuesday: 'If we get rid of rest havens for pedofiles [sic], we even the game. Right now, you could kidnap some kids in Cleveland and put them anywhere.'

Publishing house Viking announced that it has acquired a planned book by Miss Berry and Miss DeJesus. The book is currently untitled and is scheduled to come out in 2015.

Miss Knight released her memoir, Finding Me, earlier this month to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the women's escape.

Earlier this month, the women released statements saying that they had spent their first year of freedom in nearly a decade learning to drive, taking boxing lessons and cherishing time with their families.

Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus both said in statements that they are thankful and growing in many ways. Michelle Knight said in an interview on NBC's Today show that she forgave the man who kidnapped and tortured her.

Castro was arrested and eventually sentenced to life in prison. He was found hanged in his cell in September.
