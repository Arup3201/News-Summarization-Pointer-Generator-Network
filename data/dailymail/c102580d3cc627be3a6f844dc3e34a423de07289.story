They may be some of the world's most endangered animals, but caught on secret camera this colourful menagerie appear not to have a care in the world.

The giant panda, red panda, Tibetan stump-tailed macaque, takin and leopard are all regarded as endangered by the WWF.

So to gain a better understanding of them, the wildlife charity set up a dozen camera traps in the mountainous giant panda reserves of the Sichuan Province in China.

Realistic: The benefit of camera traps is that there is practically zero human interference which helps give scientists a more accurate idea of how the species behave in the wild

Say cheese: A tufted deer looks a bit shocked to be caught out by the WWF cameras

It is believed by setting up special conservation areas for the giant panda - China's national animal - other endangered animals within the same natural habitat will also be protected.

The WWF released the images yesterday to mark the International Day for Biological Diversity.

In the pictures, the likes of giant pandas, red pandas, golden pheasants and Tibetan stump-tailed macaques are all seen wandering around the wild terrain.

More than 100 infrared camera traps were placed in six nature reserves by WWF and its partners from the local forestry authority as part of the monitoring effort under the giant panda conservation programme.

The WWF says its conservation officers have gained a better understanding of the identification of animal traces and areas of their activities.

Fan Zhiyong, director of WWF species programme in China, said: 'The images demonstrate that through the conservation of the giant panda, a flagship umbrella species, we can also protect other threatened wildlife from the same habitat and preserve biological diversity.'

Jiang Zeyin, species 
programme officer at WWF China, added: 'The multimedia materials are 
obtained under circumstances where there was little external disturbance
and therefore they truly reflect the conditions of those species in the
wild.'

There
are more than 6,500 species of vertebrates in China, representing 14 
per cent of the global total - making it one of 12 globally recognised 
'mega diversity' countries.

However,
because of habitat loss and human development, the overall biodiversity
in China is in decline, despite improvements in some places.

The
population of more than ten flagship species in China, which include 
Amur tigers, musk deer and the Yangtze finless porpoise, are among a 
number of creatures which have undergone a marked decline.
