The FBI have reportedly been questioning elderly men after their names came up in a new investigation into the lynching of four black victims almost 70 years ago.

On July 25, 1946, two African-American married couples were shot dead near the Moore's Ford Bridge in Georgia.

Second World War veteran George W. Dorsey, his wife Mae Murray, and Roger Malcom with his wife Dorothy were attacked by a gang of white men on their way home, believed to be Ku Klux Klan members.

The couples were tied to a tree and shot around 60 times. Dorothy Malcom, who was seven months' pregnant, had her unborn baby cut out with a knife.

White farmer Loy Harrison was driving home the two black couples, whom he employed as sharecroppers on his land. 

There were whisperings around town that George Dorsey had secretly been dating a white woman, a taboo in the segregated South. 

And there was no love lost between the townsfolk and Roger Malcom, who had stabbed a white farmer during a knife fight 11 days earlier.

He was still waiting in jail when Harrison paid $600 to bail him out.

When Harrison's truck rolled near the crossing, a white mob grabbed the two couples from the vehicle, dragged them down a nearby trail and tied them to trees. Using rifles, shotguns and pistols, the mob fired three volleys of bullets, leaving their bodies behind slumped in the dirt, according to investigators.

President Harry Truman dispatched the FBI to Monroe, a town about 45 miles east of Atlanta.

The feds, however, were met with a wall of silence.

Harrison, the farmer who claimed he'd been 'ambushed' but was unharmed, told investigators he didn't recognize the dozen or so unmasked assailants. 

Other whites abided by a code of silence. Black people, too, kept quiet, petrified of reprisal if they spoke out.

Several suspects were named in the FBI's 1946 investigation, but, partly due to a lack of witnesses, none was ever charged. 

Now a lengthy investigation by the Equal Justice Initiative this month has produced names of potential suspects and campaigners were urging authorities to seek justice for the decades-old crimes before it's too late.

The report revealed that there were 3,959 lynchings of black people in 12 states in the South between 1877 and 1950 - at least 700 more lynchings than previously reported.

According to The Guardian, an 86-year-old man in Monroe, Georgia has been questioned over his involvement in the lynchings but said he had nothing to do with the brutal killings.

Charlie Peppers said: 'The blacks are blaming people that didn't even know what happened back then.'

He also denied ever being a member of the Ku Klux Klan. 

Daily Mail Online was awaiting on a comment from the Atlanta field office of the FBI on Monday.  

The brutal deaths of the two black couples caused outrage in the U.S. and sparked protests. Pictured in 1946, a demonstration against the Georgia lynchings where people stand with nooses around their necks

Every year, the Moore’s Ford Memorial Committee re-enact the brutal deaths of the young couples (pictured on July 25, 2005). No one has ever been prosecuted for their murders almost 70 years ago
