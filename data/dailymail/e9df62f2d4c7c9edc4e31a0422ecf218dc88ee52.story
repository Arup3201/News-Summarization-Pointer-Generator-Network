Pub landlords who illegally screen English football matches could face heavy fines or jail under copyright law as the Premier League and BSkyB begin a hardline campaign to retain its exclusive broadcasting rights.

Just months after the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that UK bar owners can 
bypass Sky by using cheap overseas de-coders to access sports services, the industry is now seeking alternative areas of law to halt them.

In what will be seen as a retaliatory strike, legislation is now being used to fine landlords for broadcasting logos, national anthems and pre-recorded footage - because it breaches copyright.

The move appears to circumvent an earlier legal ruling.

Game over: It is still unclear how the court case result will effect the wider legality of screening matches in pubs around the UK

Crack down: The Premier League and BSkyB have taken the hardline stance to stop pubs from screening illegal football matches

The hardline approach comes after a High Court judgment earlier this month, when the Premier League won a
copyright ruling against pubs using foreign de-coder cards to screen 
games.

Judge David Kitchin found that - when 
customers are able to view footage featuring logos, pre-recorded video 
sequences, previous games and anthems - pubs are violating Premier League
copyright.

In what is thought to be the first of many prosecutions to come, a landlord in Essex was last week ordered to pay more than £19,000 in fines and costs this month after being convicted of screening Premier League and international matches via Sky Sports without a commercial viewing agreement.

Ruling: The FA Premier League cannot stop people from seeking better deals from foreign broadcasters than the TV sports subscriptions offered by BSkyB

Frederick Young, licensee of a pub in Shenfield, was convicted under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act of 1988, of six offences of dishonest reception of a television reception, according to the Independent.

He was fined £2,500 for each offence and also ordered to pay £4,522 in court costs.

Portsmouth landlady Karen Murphy is currently fighting an £8,000 fine she received for using a cheaper Greek satellite service to show English football in her pub.

She was paying £118 a month to use the foreign de-coder instead of Sky subscription rate of £480.

She will go to the High Court next week in a bid to get her case overturned, using October's ECJ ruling.

Delighted: Landlady Karen Murphy had her £8,000 fine for using an imported Greek satellite decoder to save money on subscription fees in 2006 overturned today

However, while she might successfully
get her £8,000 fine overturned, the High Court is likely to uphold the 
Premier League's right to copyright, which could result in a separate 
fine.

While the first ruling was seen by 
many as a chance for football fans to watch 'cut-price' Premier League 
matches, pubs will now find themselves trapped by the copyright ruling.

The broadcaster has paid more than 
£1billion for the UK broadcast rights for Premier League matches, and 
October's ruling was described as driving a ‘coach and horses’ through 
one of BSkyB’s
most lucrative sidelines.

Sports broadcasting licences tied to individual countries were ‘contrary’ to EU competition law, the ECJ said.

The ruling threatens the estimated 
£200million in revenue Sky earns from its commercial division, which 
sells subscriptions to pubs, clubs, restaurants and gyms.

The Premier League and BSkyB are now 
outlining their intentions to take legal action in advertisements being 
published in the drinks industry trade press.
