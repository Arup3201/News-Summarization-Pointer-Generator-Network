Marks and Spencer have abandoned plans to sell red grouse meat in many of their stores following a row over how the birds are hunted.

The High Street chain had planned to sell the game in shops around the country after it was successfully trialled in two stores in west London.

But the company have postponed the plans after ornithologists threatened to boycott the store over fears rare birds of prey were being killed to protect the grouse ahead of hunting.

Plans to sell red grouse meat in Marks and Spencer have been postponed due to the fears of conservationists

The chain is bringing in a code of conduct for suppliers before selling the game in a bid to allay concerns

M&S became the first retailer to stock whole wild red grouse when it announced the game would go on sale for £10 in its flagship Kensington High Street and Marble Arch stores last August.

At the time, M&S's Tom Harvey said: 'Our customers are telling us they are keen to try more game as an alternative to traditional everyday meats.'

The birds, which have a distinctive rich flavour, were shot on the moors in Yorkshire and Northumberland and transported to stores in time for the following morning.

But the move has since been criticised by conservationists, who fear rare birds of prey like the hen harrier were being killed to protect birds for shooting.

Former RSPB conservation director Mark Avery has written to the company urging it to stop selling the meat.

The RSPB has said it believes hen harriers are being killed or driven off moorland by game keepers

Mr Avery wrote on his blog: 'The rare and threatened hen harrier hardly exists on British grouse moors these days because of illegal persecution by game-shooting interests. Other protected wildlife is also killed by grouse shooting interests.'

The Times reported today that M&S has now decided not to sell the meat until a code of conduct can be enforced with all of its suppliers.

The store's Head of Agriculture told the paper 15 estates in North Yorkshire and the Scottish borders had agreed to comply with the new code and would supply the game once it had been independently verified that they are sticking to the rules.

The decision was welcomed by the RSPB, who likened it to the responsible sourcing of many other products the stores sell.
