Liverpool got underway in the Premier League on Sunday with a 2-1 victory over Southampton at Anfield, but Adam Lallana was unable to play against his former club as he remains sidelined with injury.

The midfielder moved from the Saints for £25million over the summer, but he suffered a knee injury on their pre-season tour in Boston that ruled him out for up to six weeks.

Lallana is now doing extra training by himself as he pushes himself back to full fitness, and he will be hoping that his delayed debut is drawing ever nearer.

Meanwhile, his fellow former Southampton team-mates Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert both made their first competitive appearances for Liverpool in the Premier League opener, as well as loan signing Javi Manquillo.

Brendan Rodgers' side next face Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium next Monday night, before a trip down south to face Tottenham a week later.

There is then an international break, before things really get into full swing with the Champions League and League Cup starting. And Lallana will be hoping to return in the next couple of weeks to be involved for both club and country.

Bad timing: The former Southampton player missed the opening game of the season against the Saints

Hope: And he will be desperate to return for both Liverpool and England over the next couple of weeks
