Iker Casillas admits he thought about leaving Real Madrid during the summer's transfer window and the Spain goalkeeper believes Arsenal were lining up to sign him.

The 33-year-old decided to remain at the Bernabeu and fight for his place, despite falling behind Diego Lopez in the pecking order as Casillas made just two La Liga appearances last year.

With Lopez joining AC Milan, Casillas has returned to being a regular starter and hopes to end his career with the club he first joined as a youth in 1990.

'I thought about going,' he told Canal Plus. 'What you want is for Real Madrid to always win. 

'But in the end, at 33 years of age, you think, why should I (go)? I want to fight, to make a go of it, to be reborn from the ashes.

'There was a lot of talk about an offer from Arsenal, but there was nothing concrete. I want to stay at Real Madrid, keep fighting here and finish my career here.'

But Casillas, Spain's first-choice goalkeeper,  refuses to deny a spell abroad before bringing his career to an end.

'I would like to have some experience abroad before retiring,' he added. 

'I think it would help me to appreciate Real Madrid even more. I am convinced that if you go abroad, you will realise what this club represents for the whole world.'

Casillas was also linked with a move to Liverpool during the summer's transfer window.
