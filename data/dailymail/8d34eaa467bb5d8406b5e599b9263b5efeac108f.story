Victoria's Secret is famous for lingerie, but its latest ad campaign draws attention from the Angels' famous bodies to their equally stunning faces.

In a behind-the-scenes video from its new fall beauty shoot, Lindsay Ellingson and Candice Swanepoel model the lingerie giant's cosmetics line.

The campaign, which was shot in New York, follows the bombshell pair as they go through hair and make-up, before striking a pose clad, naturally, in Victoria's Secret lingerie.

South African-born Miss Swanepoel, 23, 
also talks viewers through the process, explaining how shooting a beauty
campaign differs from a lingerie one.

She tells the camera: 'With lingerie you have to be more conscious of your body and the way that
you move your body. With beauty it's much more intricate - it's a lot 
slower. You have to get certain looks, see the colours, it's totally different.

'When you see your face so close-up, you're really conscious of everything - the expression in your eyes, and lips,' she adds.

Miss
Swanepoel is seen modelling four different beauty looks in the footage,
though she reveals that her favourites are the bolder, statement looks.

'I always love the classic Victoria's Secret look with thick liner, kind of feline,' she says. 'I love a red lip as well.'

Of course, Miss Ellingson, 27, also holds her own on the beauty front.

The Californian bombshell, who has walked the catwalk for Chanel and Christian Dior in addition to Victoria's Secret, showcases a metallic look, complete with co-ordinating nail polish, as well as a more natural smokey-eyed look.

The Victoria's Secret Angels are all currently in training for the label's upcoming catwalk show this November.

Today, Miranda Kerr posted an Instagram photo of herself lifting weights during a personal training session.

And Doutzen Kroes has revealed that she has cut out sugar and carbs now, in the run-up to the nationally-televised event.
