Lost it: A Florida Wal-Mart worker shot another employee's car after they won employee of the month, investigators believe. Willie Mitchell (pictured) became incensed that the award was given to his co-worker

He won't be getting any awards any time soon.

A Florida Walmart employee exploded in a fit of rage after his colleague was made 'Employee' of the Month' instead of him.

Such was the bad blood between Willie Mitchell and a female co-worker, that he ended up shooting her car.

According to a Broward Sheriff’s Office arrest report Mitchell is charged with discharging a firearm from a vehicle.

The
Broward Sheriff’s Office said surveillance video from a Wal-Mart 
parking lot shows Mitchell parking next to his co-worker’s earlier this 
month.

A few 
minutes later, investigators said Mitchell rolls down a back window, 
fires a shot into his co-worker’s car and then drives off. The co-worker was
working inside the store at the time of the shooting.

Broward
Sheriff's Office spokesperson Veda Coleman-Wright said the shooting 
stemmed from some bad feelings after the victim won an Employee of the 
Month Award.

Fired: Mitchell fired a shotgun through the back window of his car. The bullet struck his co-workers car. He was then fired from his job at Walmart

'She was announced as the employee of
the month which you would think that would be something good, people 
would be happy for her,' Ms. Coleman-Wright said to CBS 4. 'But there was one employee who wasn’t happy.'

Investigators say after the award was announced Mitchell started arguing with the victim about their workload.

The victim told detectives that 'during the argument Mitchell told her repeatedly, ‘I’m gonna show you.’

Whilst she was working in the store, Mitchell then fires a short through her car window.

Walmart wallop: Investigators say bad blood over an employee of the month award at a South Florida Wal-Mart store led to gunfire and criminal charges

Award: The Walmart in Florida runs an employee of the month award which Willie Mitchell didn't win - and isn't going to anytime soon!

Investigators said they’re still stumped on the exact motive for the shooting.

'Perhaps Mitchell wanted to be employee of the month but clearly these actions that we saw in response to this, I think we see why he wasn’t chosen as employee of the month,' the Sheriff's office said.

A Wal-Mart representative said that Willie Mitchell no longer works for the company.

The employee of the month does not receive any money or gifts - it is strictly a recognition from the store.
