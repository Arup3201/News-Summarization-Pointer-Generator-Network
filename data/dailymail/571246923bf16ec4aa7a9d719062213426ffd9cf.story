A father-of-four was left 'shocked' after he discovered X-rated channels on a hospital television in a children's unit where his newborn son was receiving treatment.

Pornographic channels had been left unblocked on televisions in the Paediatric Assessment Unit at Birmingham Children's Hospital.

The hospital has apologised for the mistake and confirmed two out of 19 televisions on the unit did not have the correct channel restrictions.

The father, who did not want to be identified, told The Sun he discovered the channels while his newborn son was falling asleep as he was in the hospital for a chest infection.

He said: 'I was just flicking through the TV channels when suddenly Babestation came on.

'I carried on and there were a couple more not blocked - I was shocked.'

The man said he was told by staff that all children were supervised, but he claimed many did spend time alone in their rooms.

A hospital spokesman has told MailOnline members of the nursing team switch off televisions at 9pm as part of normal ward practice each night.

The spokesman said parents are able to turn the televisions back on if they choose after this time.

The spokesman said: 'We take all comments and feedback that we receive from our children, young people and their families very seriously.

'This is the first time we have been informed of any issues with our television channels and we are very grateful to this particular family for raising their concerns with us.

'Our bedside televisions have standard Freeview channels and we take all steps possible to restrict channels that are not suitable for children and young people.

'Normal ward practice each night is that every bedside television is switched off by members of our nursing team at 9pm, to allow our poorly children to sleep.

'We are aware, however, that a small number of parents choose to watch the bedside televisions after this time.

'Since receiving this feedback, we have responded immediately and have identified two of our bedside televisions in our Paediatric Assessment Unit that do not have the same channel restrictions as the other 17 on the ward.

'We are now taking the appropriate steps to rectify this and we will continue to regularly check all of our bedside televisions across the hospital, to ensure that they have the appropriate channel restrictions in place.'
