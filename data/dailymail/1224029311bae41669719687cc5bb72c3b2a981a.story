Governor Chris Christie has met with Prime Minister David Cameron inside No 10 Downing Street to discuss trade between New Jersey and Britain. 

The pair are believed to have swapped notes on government spending and assessing their progress since meeting in 2011 - before dining with members of Cameron's cabinet.

The discussions came on the second day of Christie's three-day visit to the UK capital in a move that could strengthen his foreign policy credentials ahead of the 2016 presidential election.

He kicked off the trip with an English Premier League soccer match to see Arsenal beat David Cameron's team of choice Aston Villa with a final score 5-0.

Sporting red and white, Arsenal's colors, he was seen cheering from a corporate box alongside his wife Mary. 

Despite missing the Super Bowl, Mr and Mrs Christie told reporters they didn't mind and that they would catch it at on re-runs.

The UK is the third largest foreign trading partner for New Jersey after Canada and Mexico, and the trip will focus on pursuing new opportunities for growth between UK and New Jersey.

'One of the main objectives for the trip is to focus on the opportunities that exist between the UK and New Jersey and our country as a whole,' said Christie.

Christie will attend a life sciences round table in Cambridge with participation from New Jersey-based biopharmaceutical company Celgene. 

But Republican Party activists have suggested the UK trip as a way to shore up Christie’s foreign-policy credentials ahead of a potential campaign.

However he was asked whether he thought anyone would know who he was. 

'I don't think I have to worry about that,' Christie told the Washington Post. 'I'm not running for anything in the United Kingdom anytime soon.'

He added: 'Game was great. Coming to a place like this, that's a pretty famous place internationally for their enthusiasm, was a lot of fun. So we had a good time.'

Christie and his wife Mary have been to London four times and said they are familiar with the city as tourists. 

Presence: Despite a media scrum around him, Christie said he was not worried whether anyone would recognize him in the UK during his trip
