They never demand pay rises, complain about their managers or behave badly off the pitch.

And while they may not have the charisma of Ronaldo or the speed of Rooney, these robots certainly have some skill.

Now students in Germany are planning to show just what robo-football players can do by pitting them against each in one of the biggest ever demonstrations of robotic footballing talent.

Robo-Ronaldo: Two teams of robots play against each other in the 2014 RoboCup German Open tournament

The event is taking place this week in Magdeburg, North West Germany from the 2nd until the 5th of April.

The robot football players are all models called 'Nao' created by French firm Aldebaran Robotics.

When playing together, the robots must act autonomously and are unable to get help from their handlers. Instead, they communicate via wi-fi to co-ordinate teamwork.

Over 950 participants from 12 countries are participating in the three-day tournaments that compete in a variety of disciplines, which also includes rescue and dance

RoboCup was set up with the aim of creating, by 2050, a team of humanoid robots that can take on and beat the best human players.

The competition aims to encourage innovation in robot building by getting engineers to tackle the problems that playing football entails.

Over 950 participants from 12 countries are participating in the three-day tournaments that compete in a variety of disciplines, which  include rescue and dance.

But by far the most popular competition is the football which was set up with the aim of creating a team of humanoid robots by 2050.

Robotics researchers believe that within 40 years a robotic football team will take to the field that will be able to defeat the current human world champions.

According to the Robocup website, the event's aim is to advance the 'state of the art' in artificial intelligence.

For robots to play football, various technologies have to be developed including artificial intelligence so the robots know who to pass to and how best to defeat an opponent as well as sophisticated robotics and sensors.

After RoboCup is over, the technologies developed for scoring winning goals is transferred to a several more useful applications such as developing robots that can be used in search and rescue.
