A man who killed five members of the same family in a drunk driving accident was confronted by the one family member who survived in a courtroom on Tuesday.

A brave Stephanie Guzman, 16, stared right at 35-year-old Efraim Carmona and told him what it was like to wake up from a coma and learn that every member of her family was dead.

Carmona, who had a blood alcohol level of .23 at the time of the crash in Houston, Texas, took a plea and will serve 50 years in prison.

All this as Guzman still remains in a wheelchair with her face and body covered in scars from the crash, which took place last June.

'It was just a moment that I couldn't believe,' said Guzman.

'It was hard for me when I found out, when they came to me and were like, "sorry for your loss." I was like, that's a lie! I couldn't believe it.'

Guzman had lost her father, Valentin Guzman, 41; mother, 40-year-old Elvira Guzman Santoy; sisters Ani and Patricia, 12 and 11; and 3-year-old brother, Valentin Jr.

Yet when speaking about Carmona later with KHOU, Guzman made it clear she was dealing with the tragedy, and doing her best to move on in the aftermath.

'I forgive him because I'm really not God. The one that he needs to say sorry to is God, not to me,' she said.

As for her family, Guzman stated; 'I know that they are happy for me, why? Because they were there for me and I really thank God and I'm really thankful because I had great parents no matter what. They were still there for me.'

Now, Guzman is focused on working hard and getting out of her wheelchair.

Carmona was driving a flatbed truck when he entered the Sam Houston Tollway’s westbound lanes but he was tragically heading east that June. 

He then hit the packed Ford F-150 pickup carrying the entire Guzman family head-on, which immediately burst into flames.

The fact that Stephanie survived has till be hailed as a 'miracle.' 

The crash was so bad that the victims could not even be identified for week saves Stephanie, who was in a coma.

Carmona pleaded guilty to five counts of intoxication manslaughter and one count of intoxication assault.
