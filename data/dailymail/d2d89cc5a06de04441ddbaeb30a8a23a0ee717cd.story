With a starring role in the original TOWIE, and a much-publicised comeback in June wearing a tiny asymmetric thong, Harry Derbidge appears a picture of confidence.

But behind the cameras the 20-year-old has been battling 'food phobia' issues for over a decade.

It was only two years ago when doctors said he would have to be admitted to a rehab clinic that the Essex boy started to change his eating habits.

'If I didn’t like the look or smell of food I'd hide it behind my tongue and spill
 it all out in the toilet. I'd be going two or three times in a meal,' Harry admitted as he opened up to Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford on ITV's This Morning.

'I was always tired and very 
lazy because I had no energy going through me. When it 
used to get cold I 
used to shake and shiver all the time because I had no meat on me. I was just skin and bone.

'My mum would be forever sending me to a 
doctor because she was always concerned about my weight,' said the TV star who admitted he used to weigh just 7st 7lbs. 'For a boy that’s really bad. The average is 10 to 11st.

'Doctors 
said if I continued losing weight they would have to send me into
 a clinic. For me that was the scariest point ever and that’s when I 
knew I had to change.'

Harry's issues, which This Morning's eating expert Dr Dawn Harper, described as a 'food phobia' started at the age of eight.

'Fussy eating is very common,' explained Dr Harper, who shared the sofa with Harry. 'Generally children grow out of it. When it becomes a problem is when it gets worse.'

For Harry, what started as being a difficult eater in childhood, spiraled out of control in his teenage years. 'I've always been a fussy eater but it turned into OCD. My poor mum would bring out the food and everything would have to be separate,' he said.

'If I had a roast dinner I'd have the peas on their own, sweetcorn on its own and chicken its on own. At the time I didn’t see it as a problem because I was so young.'

'I’d always have a a panic going out for bit of dinner because I knew I wouldn’t have anything on the menu,' he continued.

'Most of the time I would just go and sit with friends and just have a coke whilst they had their burgers.'

When doctors told Harry he needed to be admitted to a clinic, he knew he had to change his ways.

'It took a long time,' he admitted, 'But I found what I enjoyed eating – plain food. I'd have boiled plain pasta with plain chicken.

'I started eating six meals a day but I'd make them really small so I’d always feel full. I'd also have nuts in the day and lots of protein. I've also had protein shakes and I train.

'I know I'm no pump-up Pete or anything, but it helps me bulk a little bit and look fuller. Now I’m 10st and happy with how I look and feel. But another stone for me would be perfect.

'My energy is ten times better, although I've also been diagnosed with an under-active thyroid so I'm always a bit tired. But I feel better in myself.'

Good enough, in fact, to parade his filled-out body in a tiny weeny weeny asymmetric thong. 'Two years ago I would never have dreamed of anything like that,' Harry admitted.

'For me to do that was such a big thing. And hearing the response as well was amazing. It went global,' he said of the edgy swimwear trend.

Harry now wants to dedicate himself to helping children with eating issues and said, 'I want to go round to schools and talk about it and turn my negative into a positive.'
