Talk about stealing someone's thunder.

NSW Police were forced to shut down the 23rd annual Tropfest Film Festival when terrifying lightning strikes put spectators at risk.

However, Sydney's ferocious rain and cracking thunder could not dampen the festival-goers' enthusiasm, as a number of determined spectators returned in ponchos to sit in the soggy grass and watch the exhibition.

It was a display of great bravery, as earlier festival-goers had been warned 'we're about to be hit by lightning!'

A comparison of the 2013 and 2014 Tropfest crowds: A record-breaking crowd of 95,000 attended the festival at Centennial last year (inset), whereas many spectators were 'washed away' when the festival was temporarily closed down on Sunday night

The crowds were lashed with heavy rain before NSW Police were forced to evacuate the crowds due to extreme weather and dangerous lightning

Spectators were offered an early show when Sydney's 'storm week' continued, with dark and foreboding clouds leering overhead 

'Granny Smith' was announced the 2014 Tropfest winner; a dark comedy directed by Julian Lucas and produced by Nicholas Cox.

Each of the short films were required to incorporate the signature item: a mirror. 

After Lucas's win, the Melbourne filmmaker revealed that he was close to tears about 6pm while on the phone to his dad.

'I was freaking out big time, when that rain was coming in and when that notice came up on the screen that things were cancelled,' he told AAP.

'I could see the crowd exiting and I just thought, `you put so much time and effort into this' and I know it's an outdoor festival, but you just don't think it's going to happen.

'That's the least of your worries, the weather.'

When they arrived, people at the festival were offered an early show, when the sky darkened, lightning cracked across the sky and an intense storm closed in.  

At around 5.30pm, NSW Police and Tropfest organisers announced that the festival, held in Centennial Park in Sydney's east, was 'closed due to very extreme weather conditions'.

Several hundred spectators persisted and returned, wearing ponchos, to watch the short film entrants

Film fanatics were even warned not to wait in the event tents due to the danger of being struck by lightning, with people warned to move away from metal objects

Spectators tried to withstand the storm but struggled when they were unable to take shelter, warned by officials to avoid trees and even tents as the vicious storm continued. 

'Move away from all metal objects! Do not stand next to the sides of the tent, we're about to get hit by lightning,' a spokesman warned the crowd from inside a tent at the festival, according to SMH. 

The event was closed for more than an hour, meaning many spectators packed up their blankets and picnic baskets and returned home.

'Can't make it to #tropfest tonight, but have poured of bucket of water over my head and set up a few leaf blowers to replicate the experience,' tweeted musician Brendan Maclean.

However, Tropfest prevailed, with organisers tweeting: 'Nice try #SydneyStorm. We're back!'

By the time the event was re-opened, a slightly lack-lustre crowd remained of just 'several hundred'.

Most film fanatics opted to watch the television broadcast on SBS from their cosy and, more importantly, dry couches. 

Crowds enjoyed themselves nonetheless - although some might have been wishing they were sitting on their warm, dry couches at home

The crowd was a sorry sight at the 2014 Tropfest Film Festival, considering the hype and expectations

A very different sight: In 2013, the first year at the new venue Centennial Park, the festival drew in a record-breaking crowd

A fan on Twitter explained the situation perfectly, with @pixelbender83 tweeting: 'I came. I saw. I got drenched. I left. I returned home. I returned! #Tropfest 2014.'

In 2013, Tropfest drew a record crowd of more than 95,000 people at the Sydney site alone. 

On average, Tropfest attracts a live national audience of around 150,000 people, with people also attending in other capital ciites around Australia.

It was terrible luck, as the festival had been moved from February to December this year after Tropfest had been affected by rainy conditions in previous years.

Only one festival has been cancelled due to wild weather, but Tropfest was notably 2012

After studying weather patterns, the festival's organisers had decided that December was a much safer option.

Host Adam Spencer jokes 'First time for everything: #ImBlowdryingMyPants'

Musician Brendan Maclean is clearly not envious of the drenched crowd at Centennial Park!

'If you look it up, statistically Sydney has almost double the rainfall in February than it has in December, so I'm not going to pretend that didn't have something to do with it either,' Tropfest founder John Polson told AAP at the time.  

The soaked spectators kept their sense of humour, taking to social media to make light of the intense Sydney storm, with a tent at the event jokingly offering free flotation devices to prevent fans from washing away.

Tropfest and NSW Police both announced that the festival was closed due to dangerous lightning strikes

Adam Spencer, who hosted the event alongside SBS' Marc Fennell and Jeannette Francis, tweeted a photo to show that to his amusement, he had needed to blow-dry his pants.

'I assume #tropfest is short for tropical storm festival' pointed out Andrew Peake in a tweet.

'It is like they are doomed by the weather,' said Tropfest judge, Margaret Pomeranz.
