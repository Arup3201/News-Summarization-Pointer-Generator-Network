The happy announcement at the weekend that the Duchess of Cornwall had been awarded the greatest personal honour in the Queen’s gift — Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order — seemed to set the seal on a troubled past and to pave the way for a bright new future.

Indeed, there will be many across the country who’ve had a chance to meet Camilla in the seven years since she became a fully paid-up member of the House of Windsor, who will see the honour as fitting and just.

Though fearless in the saddle, she was timid and nervy when enduring her first public engagements.

Many will think it is a tribute to her application to the job — and her determination to overcome those fears — that she has earned such an outstanding honour in this, the Queen’s finest year.

Her supporters will say that since 2005 Camilla hasn’t put a foot wrong.

And if she hasn’t set the world on fire, that is by design.

In the run-up to the perfunctory civil ceremony that sealed her long-time love affair with Prince Charles, a strategy was devised that would position her in the nation’s perceptions as a substitute for the recently deceased Queen Mother — rather than the woman whose place she took in the princely bed, Princess Diana.

So there were lots of fussy hats, regal waves and a certain formal distance placed between Camilla and the public — whose love and trust she had to gain. Emphasis was placed on age and dignity. The past? Airbrushed away.

As a strategy it had its critics but it’s fair to say the passage of seven years has helped reduce hostility.

People have slowly forgotten that gloomy day at Windsor Register Office when the couple married, and the way in which police forcibly removed soft-voiced protesters legitimately expressing their fears about the suitability of Mrs Parker Bowles as a future queen consort.

No one knows better than Palace courtiers how the British public forgive and forget when it comes to the Royals. And, to an extent, the nation has forgiven and forgotten: the dark times have been buried in the past.

And so it might be supposed that last weekend was the right moment for the Queen to recognise and thank her daughter-in-law, and to welcome her into the most intimate fold of royalty — the order of chivalry that is in her gift, and her gift alone.

Yet is that what actually happened? 

Talking to historians and royal observers yesterday, a rather different picture emerged of the reasons for Camilla’s shiny new honour — and there is good reason for believing that Prince Charles was heavily involved, lobbying on his wife’s behalf.

Long ago the Queen expressed an adverse view of Camilla, which probably hasn’t fundamentally altered, I was told.

‘Those who know the Queen also know that once she has expressed a view, she very rarely retreats from it.

That has been the hallmark of her reign — her consistency and clear-sightedness.

‘But the Queen is also a pragmatist. In her Jubilee year, she would not wish it to be felt there was disaffection among the ranks of her family.’

This is why she has finally listened to urgent pleas by Prince Charles that his wife should be given parity with lesser royals such as the Countess of Wessex and Prince Michael of Kent — high-ups in the Royal Victorian Order.

‘This is personal for him — deeply personal,’ I was told. ‘He sees that his own position is diminished if his wife continues not to be part of the inner-inner circle. It’s also another part of his plan towards making Camilla his Queen.’

The back-story here is the resentment caused by the elevation of Mrs Parker Bowles to the status of royal wife seven years ago.

Two senior royal women, Princess Anne and the Queen’s cousin Princess Alexandra, suddenly found themselves pushed down the pecking order at Court, and effectively made to curtsey to a woman who just weeks before had been a commoner — and a much reviled one at that.

‘They would not put up with it,’ I was told. ‘The Queen was made aware of their discomfort and was forced to do something about it.’

As a result, a document entitled Precedence Of The Royal Family To Be Observed At Court was produced, and  its purpose was to clarify Camilla’s place in the hierarchy.

Perversely, its effect was to downgrade her from the position she might have been expected to hold.

As the wife of Prince Charles, she should have taken precedence after the Queen, as Princess Diana did. But instead, she found she’d been moved down a peg or two.

‘Princess Anne and Princess Alexandra, who have given their adult lives to royal service, saw no reason to make obeisance to this, at the time, highly unpopular woman,’ a former courtier explained.

Princess Anne, in particular, was extremely chilly towards Camilla and made it clear she had no intention ever of curtseying to her. In fact, nothing had changed — Anne also refused to curtsey to Diana — but the Queen obviously felt uncomfortable with the situation, and so she had the Order of Precedence rewritten.

All this was not lost on the Prince of Wales, who is as determined as ever to have Camilla as his Queen. He had been snubbed on that occasion. But once the Queen had spoken, nothing more could be done at the time.

Now, however, things appear to have changed. ‘It looks as if Charles finally got his way,’ I was told yesterday.

‘He’s managed to persuade the Queen, one way or the  other, that Camilla must be recognised.’

This, however, puts a slightly different gloss on Camilla’s brand-new damehood, which one commentator yesterday gushingly described as ‘illustrating the Queen’s fondness for her daughter-in- law . . . a public endorsement for her role within the family’.

What can be said to Camilla’s credit is that in more recent times she has committed herself to official duties and gathering as much acclaim as she can.

And if an appearance in The Archers, a visit to the set of the cult Danish detective series The Killing, hamming it up for the cameras with an ice-cream or posing with look-alike Beatles in Liverpool gets her the coverage, she’ll do it.

You can't say she isn’t trying (though her progress into the nation’s affections has been hampered by an incapacity to stand the strain of foreign tours.

The word ‘lazy’ has been used in the past, though less of late).

But some critics argue that for the big events in national life — a calamity or a remembrance — she can never be seen as an appropriate representative of the people. 

While praise for her integration into the royal machine grows, and her support for the future king gathers appreciation, there’s still a root-and-branch resistance to the idea of her becoming Queen, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with her husband on state occasions.

This fundamental fact is acknowledged by courtiers, but not by Prince Charles.

And so his campaign for equal status for his wife among the royal womenfolk goes doggedly on.

Some may ask what the fuss is about. After all, the Royal Victorian Order, once spoken of in hallowed tones, has lost its lustre recently.

In the midst of the seedy scandal that enveloped the Duke of York last year — after it turned out his friend, the American financier Jeffrey Epstein, was a paedophile and convicted sex offender — the Queen defiantly created her favourite son a Knight Grand Cross of the order.

‘The timing could not have been more deliberate,’ I was told.

‘Andrew was under fire on all sides. This friendship had been exposed, questions about what he was using his roving trade ambassador role for were being asked and his resignation was just around the corner. He was seen as shabby, arrogant and out of touch.

‘But at such times, the Royals circle the wagons and protect their own. So at the very height of the controversy, the Queen very publicly gave her son this shiny new gong.’

Her Majesty’s sure-footed approach — consistent over a 60-year reign — was, just this once, called into question.

‘The funny thing is that in this triumphant Diamond Jubilee year, people feel more and more protective of the Queen,’ a senior historian explained yesterday.

‘No one wants anything to  go wrong for her. No doubt she was persuaded that by bringing Camilla into the shelter of her personal order of chivalry it would be seen as a conciliatory act.’

Certainly it helps heal any rift there may be with her son over Camilla. And maybe that’s the best way of looking at it — a gong for trying hard . . . but not the ultimate seal of approval from the Queen.
