Chief constables could be stripped of powers to investigate their own officers for rudeness or laziness on duty, a minister signalled today.

Instead, low level misconduct probes could be carried out by elected Police and Crime Commissioners, police minister Damian Green suggested.

The shift in powers could improve confidence in the police by making investigations more transparent and ensuring they were conducted ‘without fear or favour’, Mr Green said.

Shift in powers: Chief constables could be stripped of powers to investigate their own officers for rudeness or laziness on duty, a minister signalled today

Critics of police disciplinary systems have long complained that too many investigations are carried out ‘in house’.

Some senior officers have been accused of being too willing to brush allegations under the carpet or let their officers escape with only a low level penalty.

Last year the police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) warned that forces were ignoring or wrongly dismissing thousands of complaints that officers were rude, lazy or failing in their duty.

Ministers have already announced that all serious and sensitive allegations against the police will be handled by the IPCC - which will be given tens of millions of pounds to take on work that was previously carried out by internal standards departments.

But the latest move raises the prospect of forces losing all control over complaints against their officers.

Mr Green, warning that policing can be too insular, says elected Police and Crime Commissioners or PCCs have been lobbying ministers for more power to carry out their own investigations.

In a speech to a conference of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners in central London, Mr Green will say: ‘Public confidence in the police requires appropriate action to be taken against officers when wrongdoing is identified.

‘And they must be sure that investigations against the police are pursued without fear or favour for those involved.

The ‘vast majority’ of day-to-day policing is conducted with the ‘utmost efficacy and professionalism’, he will say.

‘But when it is not, complaints of something as simple as basic rudeness can damage an individual’s confidence in policing.’

Having PCCs take a bigger role in complaints has ‘some obvious attractions’, he will say.

‘It would serve to increase accountability and transparency in the complaints system and, therefore, increase public confidence.’

Mr Green will defend the decision to abolish police authorities, which were replaced by PCCs following elections a year ago.

Ahead of Friday’s one year anniversary of the elections, which were blighted by low turnout, Mr Green will say PCCs are ‘here to stay’ and were an important element of democratic control of policing.

He will say: ‘Far from shying away from our landmark reform it is our intention to reinforce, strengthen and expand this new democratic institution.

‘Police authorities were invisible and unaccountable - the very opposite of the system we have introduced.

‘Policing, by its very nature, tends towards insularity. PCCs are beginning to take that away by being more aware of, and responsive to, the communities they serve.’

Almost two-thirds of appeals were overturned by the Independent Police Complaints Commission in 2011, after forces had first ruled the allegations were unfounded.

Some 54,714 individual allegations were made against police officers and staff in 2011 - the equivalent of one every ten minutes.

Most were for officers’ failure to do their job or for being rude to the public. It could mean around one in five police workers had an allegation made against them.

One in four (28 per cent) was for neglect or failure in duty - a total of 15,201 complaints - while one in six was for lack of civility, impoliteness or intolerance.
