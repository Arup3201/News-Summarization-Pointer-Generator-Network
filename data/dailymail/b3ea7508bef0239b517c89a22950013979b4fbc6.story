Another day, another goal, and another group selfie from Brazilian sensation Neymar.

The Barcelona forward scored twice for his country on Wednesday night as they continue to build from their 2014 World Cup travesty on home turf.

Brazil won their fifth game in a row under new manager Dunga, this time running riot in a 4-0 victory over Turkey in Istanbul.

Neymar's two strikes in the 20th and 60th minutes sandwiched one from Chelsea winger Willian and an own goal from Turkey defender Semih Kaya.

To celebrate, David Luiz, Thiago Silva, Marquinhos, Luiz Adriano, Willian and Douglas Costa joined Neymar in taking a photograph that the 22-year-old uploaded to Instagram. 

The Turkish crowd loudly chanted Neymar's name after he secured his brace, too.
