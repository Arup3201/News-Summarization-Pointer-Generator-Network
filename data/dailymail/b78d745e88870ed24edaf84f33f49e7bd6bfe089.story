Afghanistan's first female rapper Sosan Firooz is making history in her country, despite her chosen career angering some of her family members.

Rap is just started to develop a following in the wartorn nation and the 23-year-old sees it as the best way to tell her story.

Women performing is frowned upon in her country, but Firooz has defied convention to sing about hard-hitting subjects including the repression of women and her hopes for a peaceful Afghanistan.

Outspoken: Sosan Firooz, 23, raps about the repression of women in Afghanistan, her hopes for peace in her home country

She also raps about her family's escape to Iran during the Afghan 
civil war of the 1990s and the hardline Taliban regime's rise to power.

Firooz has spoken openly of the misery she felt as a child during a five-year stay in a country in which she claims people looked with disdain on Afghan refugees.

'While we were in Iran, we were called "dirty Afghans" and told to go to the back of the line at the bakery,' said Firooz, who also spent time as a refugee in Pakistan and returned to Afghanistan with her family seven years ago.

Those who leave, she sings, will only get jobs washing dishes or working at a car wash. 'They will miss their homeland,' she sings in her first single, Our Neighbors. 'They will want to kiss the dust of their homeland.' 

'What is the result of Afghans being refugees in Iran and Pakistan?' she continues in Dari, one of Afghanistan's two main languages.

Controversial stance: Firooz has to be accompanied by her father at all times when out for her own protection

'Half of them are addicts and the other half are terrorists!'

So far, the track has only been released on YouTube, with a video that shows a series of pictures of Firooz posing in a hip-hop style gear, with jeans, dangling chains and bracelets. In some pictures, she wears a bandana with skulls, but her long hair is not completely covered - a rarity among Afghan women, including the few female singers.

Firooz is also an actress, having had small parts in a number of local TV soap operas. Earlier this month, she sang at a three-day music festival in Kabul. Because social interaction between men and women is restricted, the musicians played for a female audience the first day and male the last two days.

She is still not yet widely known among Afghans, but is breaking with tradition in a very conservative society, where some women do not go outside without wearing blue burqas.

Violence against women is still common in Afghanistan, especially in remote areas. There are reports of women being stoned or executed in public for having affairs with men. Women accused of adultery have been killed or imprisoned.

Firooz sings of ending 'all cruelty against women and children.'

Her uncle has cut off contact with his family because of his niece, says her father, Abdul Ghafar Firooz. He has quit his job at the government-run electric department to accompany her whenever she leaves the house and protect her as she pursues her acting and musical career.

'I am her secretary, answering her phones,' he said. 'I am her bodyguard, protecting her. When she's out, I must be with her.

'Every parent must support their daughters and sons to help them progress.'

Her mother, who does humanitarian work in conservative, remote areas of southern Afghanistan, is careful not to mention her daughter's budding career.

Firooz says her family's support gives her 'the strength to fight against the problems in our society'.

There are a few male rappers in Afghanistan, including 28-year-old Bejan Zafarmal - nicknamed DJ Besho - and some of their CDs can be bought in the Kabul bazaar. 

Firooz's first -and so far only - song was arranged by well-known Afghan singer and composer Fared Rastagar, who recently returned from living in Germany and has a recording studio in Kabul.

'I admire Sosan for her courage and appreciate the support of her family,' he said.

'Rap is needed here. We need to bring changes in all parts of life including music.'

It might be a long road to stardom for Firooz She lives with her family in a mud brick house in a poor neighbourhood in north Kabul. She uses an old desktop computer to write music,and was given an electronic keyboard as a gift from one of her supporters.

She does not have the money to make CDs or a more elaborate music video, but she is determined to keep going.

'When war started in our country, there were bullets, artillery, rockets,' she raps. 'All our trees were burned down. The war forced us to leave our country.

'We are hopeful for the future in our country. And we ask that our neighbouring countries leave us alone.'
