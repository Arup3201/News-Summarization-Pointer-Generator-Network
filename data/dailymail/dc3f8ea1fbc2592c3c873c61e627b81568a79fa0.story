A woman is alleging two New York cops plied her with alcohol and one attempted to grope her despite the fact that she was an alleged rape victim.

The woman, from Seattle, Washington, described how NYPD officers Lukasz Skorzewski and Lt. Adam Lamboy flew across the country and bought her endless rounds of drinks to sleep with her.

She alleges the drunken night out ended with Skorzewski taking her back to the Embassy Suites hotel in Bellevue, where he tried to tear off her clothes and grope her.

Allegations: The unnamed woman, from Seattle, Washington, is alleging two NYPD officers Lukasz Skorzewski and Lt. Adam Lamboy flew across the country and plied her with rounds of drinks

Det. Lukasz Skorzewski, 31, left, and Lt. Adam Lamboy, 44, have each been hit with departmental charges after the unidentified 24-year-old woman's allegations made their way to the media

Both policemen have each been hit with departmental charges after the unidentified 24-year-old woman's allegations made their way to the media.

But the allegations from an interview with The New York Daily News reveal a shocking level of misconduct. 

She  began the fateful day by having lunch with Skorzewski, a married father of two, at a Seattle restaurant called the Skillet Diner where he spent time asking questions about her rape case.

She was then taken to the Pier 58 tourist area to meet Lamboy. 

She told The New York Daily News: 'Looking back, it was totally naive of me to join them. But I was like, 'This is really cool.' I really looked up to them.'

'Luke was actually the one who said, 'I don't know if you're going to be able to come because we're going to be drinking.

'But when I dropped him off, the lieutenant was the one who said, 'Oh, no, you should stay, come on,' she recalled.

'I was going through this all alone. My family didn't know,' she said. 'It felt good that they were being so nice.'

Pub: The accuser claimed Skorzewski had been so drunk that servers at an Irish bar in downtown Seattle refused to give him any more alcohol

They then went to Paddy Coyne's Irish Pub, but Skorzewski was so drunk that servers refused to give him any more alcohol.

Later, they headed to Cha Cha Lounge in Capitol Hill and then moved on to Unicorn, with the cops flashing their badges to cut the line.

She said that she attempted to leave at around midnight, but they begged her to stay. They even pleaded with her to call in sick to her job as a Starbucks barista the next morning.

She was drunk and unable to drive, so she went with them after they assured her that she would be safe if she stayed with them at their hotel. 

They  took her back to their hotel room at the Embassy Suites hotel in nearby Bellevue, Washington. 

Once there, Skorzewski loaned her some clothes and slept on the couch, she said.

But when they woke up with hangovers, Skorzewski climbed in bed with her as they watched TV and  asked to put his arm around her.

She claims he said: 'I really want to kiss you right now.' He also wanted to 'feel her up.'

She describes how he tried to work his way into her pants to tear them off but she pushed his hand away.

The next day, both policemen visited her at Starbucks and promised to stay in touch.

She said Skorzewski called her almost daily from New York for a month but the calls soon stopped, and she was 'crushed.' 

She quizzed him about why he had become distant in an e-mail but he became angry suggesting that she had screwed up his personal life.

She later saw Skorzewski in New York in October 2013 for a 'call' to the man who allegedly attacked her at a Union Square apartment in January of that year. But the man was never charged.

Skorzewski soon stopped returning her calls altogether, so she  sent a letter to a family friend in the NYPD which led to a call from the Internal Affairs Bureau.

She told Internal affairs what happened and gave them evidence, including photos from the boozy night out, text messages and phone records which showed two-hour long calls with Skorzewski. 

Shortly after her claims were partially vindicated, Lamboy and Skorzewski were transferred from the elite Manhattan Special Victims Division.

Today, the woman, who is now now studying nursing at a Manhattan university, says she feels guilty that the detective might lose his job.
