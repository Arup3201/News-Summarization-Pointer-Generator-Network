'Soldier's soldier': Cpl Michael Thacker, 27, was killed on Friday in Helmand Province

A British soldier shot dead in Afghanistan on Friday has been named as Corporal Michael Thacker.

The serviceman, from 1st Battalion, The Royal Welsh, was manning an observation post in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand Province when his patrol came under attack from small arms fire, the ministry of Defence said.

The 27-year-old father-of-one received immediate medical attention and was evacuated from the scene by helicopter but died of his injuries.

Cpl Thacker - who was born in Swindon, Wiltshire, had also served in Northern Ireland and Iraq and had completed two previous tours of Afghanistan.

He was described as a 'soldier's soldier' and 'natural leader' by his comrades.

His wife Catherine, who he lived with in Coventry, said: 'Michael was the love of my life.

'He was an amazing husband and father who will always be remembered as a funny, loving and kind man.

'Everyone who met Mike instantly liked him and through time came to love him.'

Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Webb MC, Commanding Officer, 1 Royal Welsh, said: 'Corporal Michael Thacker had all the attributes of a superb Royal Welsh junior non-commissioned officer and he was exactly the man that you would want at your side when life got difficult.

'He was a soldier's soldier - a larger than life character, highly competent, fiercely loyal and hugely proud of his family.

'He had a great sense of humour, banter was his speciality and any time spent with him was time well spent.'

He added: 'No-one ever left him without a smile on their face - he simply loved life.

'He was mischievous, fun, incredibly amiable and with a grin that would brighten the darkest of days.'

Lt Col Webb said the solider, who has a two-year-old daughter named Millie, had a bright future ahead of him after recently being promoted.

He added: 'He was a professional soldier and a natural leader. People were drawn to him and he recognised the role that he had to play.

'He knew exactly what was needed to bring out the best in those around him.

'He never shirked a challenge or took the easy option and this selfless commitment spread through those around him.'

Cpl Thacker's younger brother, Lance Corporal Matthew Thacker, also served in the 1 Royal Welsh but was not in Afghanistan at the time of his death.

Describing his older sibling as 'the best I could wish for', he said: 'We were more than brothers, we were best friends and words cannot express how much he will be missed.

'Michael is one of those people who would help others before helping himself. He could light up a dark room, always making people laugh because of his great personality.

'Devastated cannot come close to how we as a family are feeling. He died doing the job that we Thacker brothers love. He is a true hero.

'Rest in Peace. You will always be in my thoughts.'

The MoD said Cpl Thacker was part of his battalion's fire support group. The unit was manning an observation post in the war zone when they came under attack.

The fallen soldier was known affectionately as 'Thacks' and had two other siblings, Mark and Ashley.

Major Jon Matthews, the officer commanding the battalion's fire support company, described him as 'a great man who will be sorely missed by all those who had the pleasure of working with him'.

'I am immensely proud to have known him and I am grateful for the zeal and determination with which he approached soldiering in Fire Support Company,' he added.

'Thacks was not only a soldier; he was a family man too. He was a devoted husband and a doting father.'

Cpl Thacker is the 416th member of UK forces to have died since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he was 'deeply saddened' to hear of the death.

He added: 'It is clear he was a larger than life character. He was a credit to his regiment and I extend my deepest sympathies to his family, loved ones and colleagues at this very difficult time.'
