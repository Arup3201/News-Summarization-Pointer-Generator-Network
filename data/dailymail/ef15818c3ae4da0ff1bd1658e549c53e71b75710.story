Boarded up and sliding into disrepair, they are the historic landmarks reduced to crumbling relics after lying empty for years.

But a number of much-loved buildings, currently lying derelict across Britain, could soon be brought back to their former glory – thanks to a huge injection of Lottery cash.

More than £18million is due to be spent on bringing six buildings back to life with grants ranging from £784,000 to nearly £5million.

The Heritage Lottery Fund gave the green light last month for a £4.7million restoration fund to rescue the derelict Saltdean Lido (pictured)

Just last month, the Heritage Lottery Fund announced plans to hand over £4.7million for the restoration of the derelict Saltdean Lido in East Sussex.

England’s only Grade II* listed lido, just four miles along the coast from Brighton, was designed as the centre piece of Saltdean’s new seaside resort and first opened in 1938 drawing in crowds from far and wide.

With the exception of the council run local library and a number of small-scale commercial activities in a 1960s extension, the site has been vacant since 2011 and is on English Heritage’s At Risk Register. 

New funding will transform the site into a modern leisure destination providing the local community with a heated outdoor pool, indoor and outdoor play areas, café, gym, community and function rooms, and a revived library.

A £4million grant has also been earmarked for The Globe in the centre of Stockton to help breathe life back into the Grade II Listed Art Deco ‘super theatre’.
