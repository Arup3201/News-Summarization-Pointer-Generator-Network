From heart-shaped lakes to patterned waterfalls, these stunning images show Iceland photographed from above.

Landscape photographer Lukas Gawenda shot the images while flying in a Cessna aircraft, capturing the country from a new angle.

Iceland's stunning features are transformed into abstract compositions - waterfalls, rivers and mountains appear as a blur of colours, lines and shapes, forming breathtaking patterns.

From the skies: Some of the pictures are obviously landscape shots while others take on otherworldly qualities

A landscape lover from the age of ten, Gawenda has photographed everything from US National Parks to his home country but none of them are as remarkable as his series of Icelandic portraits, Iceland From Above.

'Almost every year in August or September, we fly a Cessna through the Icelandic landscape.' Gawenda said. 

'[Because] only from above do you begin to see certain colours, influenced by the angle and the sunlight.

Shoreline: The demarcation of land and sea is crystal clear from the photographer's angle. The lacy froth on the swell of waves present a stark contrast against the dark sandy beach

Dramatic: Waterfalls, rivers and mountains are transformed in Lukas Gawende's Iceland from Above series. The landscape photographer hopes that nature's wonders are protected and preserved

Mountain peaks: The country's majesty and grandeur are captured beautifully in Gawenda's series Iceland from Above. The photographer flew over Iceland in a Cessna over August and September

Scenes of beauty: Tendrils of water snake their way through raised hills and sunken valleys. 'Only from above do you begin to see certain colors, influenced by the angle and the sunlight,' Gawenda says

'The red colour in the rivers stems from the iron oxide, the yellow from the acidic bog soil and the blue from the glacial rivers, and together everything flows into a work of art as the shapes and colours combine.

'With my photographs, I want to not only show the beauty of nature, but at the same time to draw attention to its vulnerability.

'I hope that these wonders of nature are appreciated, protected and preserved in their proper manner.'

The series of Iceland from Above can be see on Gawenda's website.
