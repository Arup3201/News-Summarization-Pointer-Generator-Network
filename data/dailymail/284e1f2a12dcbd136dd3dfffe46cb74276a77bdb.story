Adam Lee-Potter suffers from gout, picture at his home in Sutton Poyntz, Dorset

My name is Adam and I've got gout. Cue much hilarity and jokes at my expense about port and eating too much pheasant.

Through sheer embarrassment I've been lying about my gout for years, but I've finally run out of excuses for my never-far-away hobble. There are only so many skiing accidents, mountain bike crashes  and trodden-on wine glasses any one  43-year-old can feasibly sustain.

The normal instinct if you spot someone in obvious pain, unable to endure so much as the weight of a sock on his bulging, hot big toe, is not to double over in amusement. That is, unless it's gout.

During one of my regular flare-ups, a colleague on a Sunday newspaper invariably demanded to look at my grotesque ankle - as glossy and red as an apple, heat coming up off it like an old bar heater. Just a glimpse rendered her insensible with laughter.

Even alcoholics and drug addicts elicit more sympathy. Gout sufferers - all 1.5 million of us in the UK alone - receive only mockery.

This is despite the fact that gout is, say medical experts, the most painful condition known to man. It now affects one in 40 adults in the UK, according to a study published last week by the British Medical Journal, yet it is still widely laughed off as a comedic, self-induced complaint brought on by perceived over-indulgence.

The latest study found that between 1997 and 2012 the incidence of gout increased by 29.6 per cent. Although the researchers did not investigate possible causes, rising obesity and alcohol consumption have been blamed.

And to be sure, alcohol - beer, chiefly - and red meat (not to mention lentils, broccoli, sashimi and, tragically, Marmite), do aggravate the condition, but they do not necessarily cause it.

So little is still really known about gout. A classically unsexy condition, medical research has been woefully under-funded, lacklustre at best.

Indeed, no one has yet been able even to explain why men - at a ratio of up to ten to one, though the gulf is closing - are so much more prone to it than women.

This knowledge gap perhaps explains why, as the latest study found, two-thirds of British gout sufferers have not yet been prescribed preventative drugs.

I suffered my first paralysing attack at just 21 - I was then a supremely fit, clean-living, 12st vegetarian who regularly cycled 100 miles a day. I was trying to walk half-a-mile to the university library one morning with what I assumed was a badly sprained ankle.

I managed 100 yards before the throbbing pain brought me to an agonising halt: it felt like my right ankle had not only broken in two, but had then been skewered with a rusty blade smeared with some Russian toxin.

I couldn't even get my boot off because of the outrageous swelling.

Hopping didn't work - the movement made the pain even worse - so I started crawling home on my hands and knees. At this point, a passing motorist asked if I wanted a lift to the doctor.

I was swiftly referred to an orthopaedic specialist - a Harley Street consultant who had once treated the tennis player Jimmy Connors.

Gout was not mentioned; no blood tests done. He told me I'd clearly suffered a forgotten sporting injury in my youth and sent me away with a wobble board (a special board you stand on to strengthen your muscles) and some insoles for my shoes.

Years passed, with these bizarre attacks getting ever more frequent. By my late 20s, I was experiencing fortnight-long flare-ups twice a year.

Sometimes the pain was so excruciating, I couldn't leave my flat for days, having to send friends out to buy industrial amounts of ibuprofen (which I'd stupidly take at three times the maximum dose), plus Nurofen gel, with Deep Heat spray on top.

My father - a pathologist who himself developed gout in his 40s - thought it might be tendonitis, an inflamed tendon.

I saw another specialist, who suggested surgery - removing a sliver of healthy ankle bone to alleviate supposed pressure from the Achilles tendon. That didn't sound sensible to me. I declined.

Symptoms, as they do, worsened, but it was not until 2004 that, aged 34, gout was finally diagnosed.

I'd never been fitter - I'd just done an 18-month, 15,000-mile charity cycle ride around the world - but I was still getting attacks that kept me out of the saddle for days at a time.

I had also developed what a clinic in Singapore declared 'bursae', or bursitis - bulging pockets of crunchy fluid hanging off my elbows like water wings - and 'ganglions': bony, marble-sized lumps that studded my knuckles.

Back home, I made an appointment with my new GP, in Dorset, who immediately suggested gout, a diagnosis swiftly confirmed by a blood test.

Gout - a condition that often runs in families - is caused by the body's inability to break down and excrete purines, compounds found in certain foods. This in turn causes a spike in uric acid, which builds up and forms crystals that gather in a joint, causing inflammation and acute pain.

My uric acid level, at 0.72, was way outside the normal range of 0.11 to 0.42. I was torn between relief and embarrassed horror.

But why the shame? Diet is a factor, of course. Hence all the rich-living jokes. Certainly, it's true that GP guidelines advise you to moderate or cut your consumption of purine-rich foods - red meat, liver, kidneys, shellfish - as well as sticking to the maximum alcohol units (and drinking wine or cider, rather than beer or spirits).

Symptoms, as they do, worsened, but it was not until 2004 that, aged 34, gout was finally diagnosed

There is no doubt the surest way to bring your uric acid level down is medication.

Upon my belated diagnosis, I was almost immediately prescribed 300mg of Allopurinol daily - a uric acid-lowering pill I will probably have to take for the rest of my life. My levels were back to normal within a month; the attacks stopped, briefly. The painful bumps on my elbows and knuckles were, however, starting to bother me. I finally persuaded an orthopaedic surgeon to remove the 'ganglions' on my fingers.

This was done with a local anaesthetic and I will never forget watching the sweat trickling down his brow as he put his knee up on a London operating table for leverage while he battled to saw through the chalky lumps.

The proportion of gout patients thought to develop kidney stones

They were not, in fact, ganglions. Nor did I have bursitis in my elbows. As a result of my gout remaining undiagnosed and rampant for more than ten years, I'd developed chronic tophaceous gout (or tophi): clumps of uric acid crystals stuck in my joints.

I now have scars across my knuckles that would not shame a prize fighter, but at least I no longer look as though I'm wearing rings under the skin. My elbows are still baggy but they are slowly deflating, thanks to medication.

I still have flare-ups, though. I was driving my daughter to school the other morning - my swollen ankle heavily strapped - when I felt an explosion of wet warmth trickling down my right forearm. I rolled up my sleeve to see what looked like cottage cheese spurting, with arterial force, from a pea-sized hole in my elbow: the rock-hard urate crystals, excited by the latest flare-up, had burst through the skin.

Aside from medication, Adam has embraced lifestyle change

I was duly referred to an orthopaedic surgeon - who didn't want to operate - and then to a consultant rheumatologist, who decided drugs were still the answer.

Blood tests showed my uric acid levels had inexplicably crept back up. This did seem very unfair. Aside from medication, I have embraced lifestyle change and any alternative remedy thought to help: cherry extract, a daily spoonful of bicarbonate of soda - said to rid the body of uric acid. I even wear a thermal sock on my right foot in bed because uric acid levels rise as your body temperature drops at night.

My refusal to quit Marmite notwithstanding, I have forsworn beer, shunned spinach (less of a sacrifice, admittedly) and am now - badgered by my doctor - considering giving up playing squash. For, as with any arthritic condition, while exercise is beneficial, any activity that aggravates your joints can trigger a gout attack.

Nonetheless, damage has been done. Uric acid has eaten my ankle away to such an extent that I now also have osteoarthritis.

So I still have an on-off limp. But I am now on a hefty, daily 700 mg of Allopurinol - finally, I hope, the correct dosage - which should bring my uric acid down to less than 0.3, a level at which my body should, within two years, be able to absorb my tophi. And at that level there should be no more flare-ups  - scarred fingers crossed.

Yet there are potential downsides. As my rheumatologist admitted: 'We'll need to keep a close eye on you. These high levels of Allopurinol could upset your kidneys.'

'By "upset", do you actually mean damage?' I asked her.

'Yes,' she admitted. 'At some point, it's either a new ankle or new kidneys. Probably. Sorry.'

And - although gout will, I'm sure, always be a tad comic - that's not quite so funny, is it?
