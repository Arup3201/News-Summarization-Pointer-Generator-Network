Keeping his head down: Gerard Hagan, pictured during his trial, escaped from HMP Kirkham in 2012 and went on the run in spain

An on-the-run drugs mule who was part of a botched plot to smuggle cocaine worth £345 million into the UK has been caught in Spain.

Gerard Hagan, 29, was jailed for 10 years for his part in the plot which fell apart when the gang put diesel in a boat’s engines instead of petrol.

He was caught last week as he left a gym in Estepona on the Costa del Sol.

Hagan, from Liverpool had been moved 
from an Irish jail to serve his sentence in England in 2010 before he 
escaped in July last year.

He
was in custody at HMP Kirkham, Lancashire, when he fled prompting 
authorities to issue a European Arrest Warrant as they believed he was 
in Spain.

Yesterday the 
UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) revealed Hagan was captured by Spanish 
police last Thursday after he left a gym and that extradition 
proceedings to bring him back to the UK are now under way.

Dave Allen, head of the NCA’s Fugitives Unit, said: 'This arrest is a result of close working with the Spanish National Police.

'It demonstrates the NCA and its partners have the capability to pursue fugitives relentlessly.'

Hagan was jailed in November 2008 at Cork Circuit Criminal Court after pleading guilty to his part in the audacious transatlantic cocaine trafficking plot.

He was paid £5,000 to take part in the smuggling which aimed to bring cocaine into Britain through Ireland and was organised by a former Met Police drugs squad detective Michael Daly.

Others in the gang were Perry Wharrie, 48, from Essex, and Martin Wanden, who had no fixed address, who were each sentenced to 30 years.

The botched smuggling attempt was the 
biggest ever drugs bust in Irish policing history.

It included 1.5 
tonnes of cocaine in 62 bales, some of which had to be fished from the 
seas off Mizen Head on the west Cork coast in July 2007.

The drugs were sailed across the Atlantic Ocean on a catamaran called Lucky Day.

The gang had been using a rigid inflatable to bring the bales of cocaine from the boat to shore.

But hit by strong winds and three metre swells, the overloaded vessel capsized after the engines cut out, which the men’s trial heard was because 'some idiot' had filled them with the wrong fuel.
