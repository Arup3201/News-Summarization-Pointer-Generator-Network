These eerie scenes show soldiers rehearsing in the fog for a reburial ceremony after the bodies of 20 British First World War soldiers were found.

The only man of those discovered to have been identified by name is Private William McAleer, from the 7th Battalion the Royal Scottish Fusiliers.

His relatives will be represented at the service tomorrow in Loos-en-Gohelle, France, by his step-great-nephew - almost 100 years after he died.

The 20 bodies were found at a construction site of a new prison being built in October 2010, where the Battle of Loos took place in September 1915.

Soldiers of The 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland are rehearsing in Loos, with 19 unidentified men set to be buried as ‘Known Unto God’.

Practising: Members of The 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland  rehearse for a re-burial ceremony amongst World War One headstones in Loos

Getting ready: Corporal Stuart Gillies of The 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland practises his bagpipes in Loos British Cemetery during a rehearsal

Moving: Almost 100 years after they were killed in 1915, 20 British soldiers will be re-interred in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Loos British Cemetery

Peter Francis, of the Commonwealth War
 Graves Commission, revealed there are around 20 cases of discovered 
remains of soldiers each year.

He told MailOnline today: ‘These casualties were discovered at a construction site of a new prison being built. 

‘During
 work preparing the ground for that, they found what appeared to be a 
battleground grave, which also contained some 30 German casualties.

‘From the location and regiments involved, initial indications were that these were from the Battle of Loos in September 1915.’

The
 Battle of Loos featured the first British use of poison gas, and 
followed a four-day artillery bombardment along a six-and-a-half-mile 
front.

The attack led by Sir
 Douglas Haig happened simultaneously as the French attacked the German 
lines at Champagne and at Vimy Ridge in Arras.

Found: Private William McAleer, from the 7th Battalion the Royal Scottish Fusiliers, was found with his identity disc, but others found with him remain unidentified

Carrying the coffin: The 20 bodies were discovered at a construction site of a new prison being built in October 2010, where the Battle of Loos took place in 1915

Discovery: Six soldiers were from the Royal Scots Fusiliers, two from the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, and one from the Northumberland Fusiliers

But the Germans were able to 
successfully hold their position on both fronts, helped by a second line
 of trenches built six miles behind the front lines.

Mr Francis said that 13766 Private McAleer's body was identified only because he happened to have a metal identification tag on him.

He
 added: ‘This is slightly unusual because British soldiers didn’t have 
metal ID tags during the First World War, so this was something he'd got
 himself.

‘In 1916 they 
brought in the two tags, but they were made of a compressed cardboard, 
not metal - but soldiers often brought their own metal ones.’

Private McAleer’s father was a miner and died in a pit accident, and his mother
 later remarried - explaining the step-great-nephew, Mr Francis said.

He has until now been commemorated on the Loos Memorial. His regiment landed in France on July 9, 1915, and he was killed on September 26.

Mr Francis added: ‘The remains were recovered by the Commission and kept safe in 
our mortuary, near Arras. Then the Ministry of Defence got involved.

Ruins of Loos: The battle featured the first British use of poison gas, and followed a four-day artillery bombardment along a six-and-a-half-mile front.

Devastation: The attack in Loos led by Sir Douglas Haig happened simultaneously as the French attacked the German lines at Champagne and at Vimy Ridge in Arras.

‘They have a unit called the Joint Casualty and Compassionate Centre – they deal with present-day military casualties but also historical cases as well.

‘They began the lengthy task of looking at whether or not they can identify these individuals.’

The 19 unidentified soldiers are labelled only as ‘Known Unto God’ - a description on headstones which was chosen by author Rudyard Kipling.

But for 10 of those soldiers, their regiment has been identified thanks to their clothing. One was from the Yorkshire and Lancashire regiment.

Six were from the Royal Scots Fusiliers, two from the Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders, and one from the Northumberland Fusiliers.

Mr Francis said that under battlefield 
conditions, both sides would try to bury their fallen and the other 
sides fallen, if there was a lull in the fighting.

Memorial: The Commonwealth War Graves Commission said there are around 187,000 graves from the First World War that have the 'Known Unto God' inscription

He added: ‘It may have been a case of digging a pit, or using a shellhole, and give the men the best burial they could in those circumstances.’

Mr Francis said there are around 187,000 graves from the First World War that have the ‘Known Unto God’ inscription.

He said: ‘You watch the young men of what would have been his antecedent regiment, and they are burying one of their own - it’s a moving experience.’

A Ministry of Defence spokesman told MailOnline of Private McAleer: ‘We know that his blood relatives emigrated to the US and Canada.

‘We do have a great-step nephew, who is coming. The person who’s coming tomorrow is descended from the mother’s son. He also has a brother.’
