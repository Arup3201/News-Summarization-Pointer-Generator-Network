As Australia's highest paid bank boss announced her retirement at the age of 58 after seven years at the helm of Westpac, there was one man she wanted to thank above all the others.

Chief executive Gail Kelly, who has helped Westpac doubled its profits while she’s been in charge, said she ‘would like to thank one special person and that’s my husband Allan’.

The South African-born Australian businesswoman met Allan Kelly while at university in Cape Town. After they married she began working as a teacher and he as a social worker before she switched to banking and he went into medicine. They had four children together, including triplets, and came across to Australia in the late 1990’s, eventually becoming Australian citizens in 2001.

‘We’ve been married 37 years and we’ve been in this journey of life together,’ she said during a press conference at Westpac’s head office in Sydney’s CBD.

‘He’s encouraged me to be bold, to back myself, he’s encourage me to be the very best I can be. There’s no way I could do what I do without him and his wonderful support,’ Mrs Kelly gushed.

She announced she will be replaced by Westpac's Australian financial services chief executive Brian Hartzer from February 1, 2015, when she retires from her executive role.

However, she said that despite retiring from Westpac she will continue to work on her other passions and charity work. 

‘I don’t think these days people retire fully, if you think I’m going to put my feet up at home that’s not what I mean,’ she said.

‘I am full of energy, I love my life, I love what I do and the things I hope I can make a contribution to into the future,’ she explained as she listed the roles she will continue at the US Foreign Relations Council and the humanitarian charity CARE Australia.

‘I’m an ambassador for CARE Australia, they do amazing work for women and children in emerging markets,’ she said. 

Mrs Kelly has been called 'one of Australia's most successful CEO's'

Mrs Kelly's huge $12.8 million earnings a year were revealed in the bank's annual report on Wednesday. 

Her fixed pay is $3 million a year but she pocketed an extra $7 million in performance shares and a short-term cash incentive of $2.74 million.

Chairman of Westpac Lindsay Maxstead said: 'On behalf of the Board I want to thank and acknowledge Gail's leadership and outstanding contribution to Westpac.

'Gail is one of Australia's most successful CEOs... During her tenure the value of the company has more than doubled, with market capitalisation increasing from just under $50 billion to around $104 billion.

'Gail drove the successful merger with St. George, which saw the Group strengthen its position in retail banking and in wealth.'

Mr Maxstead also congratulated Gail on the way she has nurtured talent in the corporation.

'She has personally driven the growth of women in senior executive roles, mature aged workers and those who work part-time,' he said.

Her replacement, Mr Hartzer, has more than 25 years' experience in financial services. Before joining Westpac in 2012, he was Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) Chief Executive Officer UK Retail, Wealth and Ulster Bank.

He has also worked as a senior executive at ANZ.

On Wednesday, the day before her retirement announcement, Mrs Kelly also made a statement on climate change.

'There is little doubt that climate change is one of the defining issues of our time,' she said.

'The science is telling is that in our lifetime we are going to face sweeping climatic changes with environmental, economic, health and social impacts that will change the way we live our lives,' she added.

Mrs Kelly warned that 'there is still along way to go' at Westpac as they reduce their own carbon footprint and try increase awareness and understanding.
