Visitors on a tour of the White House today were left stunned by a surprise appearance from Michelle Obama and former First Daughter Jenna Bush Hager. 

In celebration of the addition of the Old Family Dining Room to the visitor route, the pair greeted tourists as they walked in.

And there was just one thing the visitors wanted from Mrs Obama on meeting her: a hug.

Almost every person who walked through the doors got an embrace from the First Lady, as screenshots from a live stream reveal.

One remarked on her height, commenting: 'You're so tall!' 

Surprising a White House tour has become something of a tradition for the First Lady.

'At least once a year I try to surprise a tour,' Mrs Obama told one tourist during an approximately half-hour appearance shown on the White House website. 

Ms Bush Hager, who was at the White House to interview Mrs Obama for the Today show, gave out her fair share of hugs too.

The White House announced that the nearly 200-year-old Old Family Dining Room would be opened to the public for the first time this morning.

The room was recently refurbished and will be a showcase for 20th century art and design. 

The Old Family Dining Room is a smaller dining room off the State Dining Room on the first floor. It was created by President John Quincy Adams in 1825 as a place for the first family to eat meals, White House curator William Allman wrote on the White House blog.

After the family's dining room was moved upstairs to the private residence, presidents used the Old Family Dining Room for small official meals, including working luncheons with foreign heads of state, Allman said. Obama also has used the room for an annual Passover seder.

Before the renovation, the Old Family Dining Room had sunny yellow walls and drapery and a light-toned rug edged in blue underneath the dining table.

The room now features gray walls and red draperies, along with a wool rug in a pictorial weaving of black, white and gray.

As part of the renovation, four works of American abstract art, a favorite of the Obama family, have been donated to the permanent White House collection to be displayed in the dining room.

The works of art include: 'Resurrection,' by Alma Thomas, 'Early Bloomer,' by Robert Rauschenberg and two by Josef Albers, 'Study for Homage to the Square' and 'Homage to the Square.'

The renovation was a joint effort by Mrs. Obama and the Committee for the Preservation of the White House. It was paid for by a donation from the White House Historical Association.
