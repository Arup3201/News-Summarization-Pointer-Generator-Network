Waxing styles can differ greatly but the latest fad gives the best of both worlds with a tiny bit of hair on top and nothing below

Whether it’s Brazilian, Hollywood or a simple bikini line tidy, most women have a personal preference when it comes to their waxing needs.

The traditional Brazilian wax involves removing all the hair from the back and front of the lower region, but leaving a strip or triangle shape at the top - often cheekily referred to as a landing strip.

But the new ‘full-bush’ version leaves the top area of your pubic hair fully grown.

NY Mag
 reported the trend after a journalist for the mag was informed by her 
own waxing therapist that it was becoming more and more popular.

During
 a regular appointment at her salon in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the 
writer's waxing got to chatting about the latest treatments they were 
offering and explained that more patrons had requested the new version.

But although the trend may have started in the States, it’s popular amongst British women, too.

‘We’ve had a lot of requests for this, 
but we call it a Brazilian with Hollywood lips,’ says Caron Vetter, 
Managaing Director of the Belmore Centre in Aylesbury.

According to Vetter, women like having the mix of a hint of natural pubic hair but like keeping the area bare below.

'We’re often told that women feel cleaner and more hygenic when there is less hair down there,' she explains.

‘But, at the same time, many women still like having some pubic hair along the mound.

‘In the last two to three years we’ve found the more intimate types of waxing are more popular and I wouldn't be surprised if this trend carried on.'

After all, said Vetter, the traditional Brazilian wax was once deemed a fad, but it's now one of the most popular preferences amongst British women.
