A Russian Orthodox priest has prayed for the Soyuz spacecraft ahead of its blast off tomorrow to the International Space Station.

The crew arrived at the Baikonur launch site in Kazakhstan two weeks before the launch tomorrow to prepare themselves for the journey. 

The three-man crew is made up of European Space Agency's German astronaut Alexander Gerst, Russian cosmonaut Maxim Suraev and U.S. NASA astronaut Gregory Wiseman.

Mr Gerst blogged about the flight to the International Space Station in a post called 6,000 hours of training leads to this. 

He was selected as an astronaut four-and-a-half years ago.

He wrote: 'Circling Earth, we will travel almost twice the distance I travelled in the last four years each day. We will witness 16 sunrises and sunsets every 24 hours. I cannot wait.'

Mr Gerst's inclusion on the latest trip to the space station comes despite a growing row between Russia and the U.S. on the future of the programme.

Russia earlier this month warned it could cease cooperating with the U.S. after 2020 - their relationship has soured in the wake of the Ukraine crisis.

Expedition 40/41 kicks off a busy year in space travel for the European Space Agency.

Launch of the Soyuz rocket is scheduled for tomorrow and will send Expedition 40 Soyuz Commander Maxim Suraev of the Russian Federal Space Agency, Roscosmos, Flight Engineer US NASA astronaut Gregory R. Wiseman and German ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst on a mission aboard the International Space Station

Two astronauts are set to be sent into space before the end of this year. 

The astronauts have taken part in numerous ceremonies leading up to their launch. 

For example, the prime crew planted trees in the same garden that Yuri Gagarin placed his, about 53 years ago.

Watching the Russian film 'White Sun of the Desert' was also on their to-do list the night before launch.

On the way to the launch pad, the prime crew will stop to relieve themselves because that is what Gagarin did himself.
