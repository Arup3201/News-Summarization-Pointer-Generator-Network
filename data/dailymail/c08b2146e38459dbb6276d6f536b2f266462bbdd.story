Irish rock foursome U2 has been accused of 'cashing in' on The Troubles after apparently turning a Belfast street into a scene of bloody  violence for its new release.

Production for what is believed to be the band's latest video is taking place on a residential street in the New Lodge area of north Belfast, a part of the city swamped by violence during the early 1970s.

Dramatic photographs taken on the set depict what appears to be the aftermath of a bomb blast, with debris and shattered vehicles strewn across the street.

Irish rock foursome U2 is believed to have turned a Belfast street into a scene of bloody street violence for their latest music video

The move has prompted criticism that the band is cashing in on The Troubles in Northern Ireland

In other pictures, wounded actors are seen fleeing from their homes, grabbing onto their loved ones.

The images - eerily similar to real scenes from the era of The Troubles - have caused a stir, with many taking to Twitter to condemn the band for capitalising on the country's dark history.

Others have claimed the video will only serve to remind the world about Northern Ireland's darkest days and prevent the country from moving on.

One of U2's most famous hits, Sunday Bloody Sunday, described the horror felt by an observer of The Troubles, focusing mainly on the Bloody Sunday incident in Derry in which British troops shot dead protesters.

One user wrote: 'Good to see u2 cashing in on the troubles again', while another said: 'Thanks U2 for shooting a music video in Belfast that makes us look like we're still in the troubles.'

Another person tweeted: 'Jeez are U2 making a music video in Belfast about the troubles? Can't we put the past behind us and show the world another side to us?'

As the street was converted in a film set, people took to Twitter to condemn what was happening

Meanwhile, the set has caused speculation among fans, with some claiming the video is for the band's upcoming single The Troubles - which is not about The Troubles.

Others say it will be the music video for Raised by Wolves - a song which talks about a bombed street - while others claim it is for Every Breaking Wave.

In Raised by Wolves, the lyrics reference a father being crushed under the weight of a cross, followed by the lines: 'Blood in the house, Blood on the street, The worst things in the world are justified by belief.'  

Others were more excited and supportive about the area being promoted in the video

Band members Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen have so far not been spotted in the area. A spokesman for the group said it did not know if the set was being used for a U2 video.

Today's filming is not the first time New Lodge has been used as the set for a music video.

In 2011, popstar Rihanna brought the area to a standstill as she filmed the music video for her song We Found Love.

U2 are currently releasing tracks from the latest album Songs of Innocence, which was given away to half a billion iTunes customers in September. It later went on general sale.

Last month, frontman Bono, 54, had to have surgery after being injured in a bicycle crash.
