Former England manager Fabio Capello used a word associated with homophobic abuse in a radio interview in which he also defended racist comments made by Arrigo Sacchi.

Capello had been asked if he thought criticism of current La Liga champions Atletico Madrid for an over-physical approach was justified and he replied: 'I don't agree that they are violent. Football is not for mariquitas.'

The Spanish word mariquitas is the diminutive of marica which is an offensive terms used against gay people. Capello could argue in this context a closer translation would be 'football is not for fairies' but many took to social media to condemn the comments made on Spain's Onda Cero radio station.

Fabio Capello has come under fire after using the derogative term for gay people during his radio interview

In the same interview Capello defended Sacchi over comments from the former Italy boss earlier this week.

Sacchi had said toTuttosport: 'Italy has too many foreign players. Look at the Viareggio tournament, I would say there are too many black players.' 

He later claimed his record as a coach demonstrated he was not a racist. 

'What he said is not racism,' said Capello. 'We just need to have more Italian players in our youth academies, [players] with an Italian identity. We also have black players who are Italian but he was referring to the youth teams that have eight or nine foreign players in them.'

Capello's comments include him talking about Spanish dictator Francisco Franco in a good light

Capello is no stranger to controversy. In 2006 after his first spell as Real Madrid coach he returned to Italy telling newspaper La Repubblica that he missed the combination of: 'Latin creativity and the rigorous order that Franco left behind' in Spain. The comments horrified those who had suffered under the dictator during his 36-year-reign.

Capello was paid £6million a year by the Football Association as England manager but was sacked after four unproductive years. 

He is currently Russia's head coach but his time in charge has been marred by appalling results and problems over unpaid wages.
