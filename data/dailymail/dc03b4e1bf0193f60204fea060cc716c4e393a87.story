The
number of men doing part-time work because they cannot find a full-time
job has more than doubled in the last four years, according to a new study.

The
Trade Union Congress (TUC) said almost 600,000 men were working part-time in December while 
looking for full-time positions, compared to 293,000 at the end of 2007.

Latest
official figures have shown that 1.4 million workers and self-employed 
people work part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, the
highest figure since records began in 1992.

The number of people settling for part-time positions has sky-rocketed with the highest number of disgruntled workers based in London

People living in the 
east of England have been hit by the biggest increase in 
under-employment over the past four years, with the number of men 
“trapped” in part-time jobs more than trebling to almost 60,000, said 
the TUC.

Its analysis of official figures showed that the North East,
Northern Ireland and London also experienced sharp rises in involuntary
part-time work.

The report, published ahead of the latest 
unemployment figures tomorrow, also revealed that the number of women 
working in involuntary part-time jobs has more than doubled in London 
and Northern Ireland over the past four years.

More employees in Britain have been forced to work part-time than anywhere else in Europe - according to figures released by the European Union.

Unemployment fell by 35,000 to 2.65million between December and February this year - the first quarterly since last spring.

But experts suggest that this fall was fueled by the rise in part-time workers.

There are 1.77million Britons classed as ‘underemployed’, which means they want to work longer hours but cannot find any available jobs.

As a result, these workers said they had no choice but to take a part-time job despite needing the money from a full-time job or extra shifts.

The average worker with a full-time job is paid an annual salary of £26,000 while a part time worker gets only £8,000 on average.

TUC general secretary 
Brendan Barber said: “Last month’s fall in unemployment was a welcome 
surprise. No-one should be under any illusion however that the jobs 
crisis is over.

“Virtually all employment growth is coming from 
part-time and temporary jobs but most of the people taking them want and
need permanent, full-time work.

“Any job may be better than no job 
at all but people are having to make huge salary sacrifices to stay 
working. This is bad news for family finances and it is holding back our
economy.

“Any hope of an economic recovery that benefits everyone 
rests on the growth of well-paid, skilled, full-time jobs. It is the 
only way for people to increase their incomes and get back to working to
the best of their ability.

“Proper jobs growth, rather than 
self-defeating austerity and making work even more insecure by attacking
basic employment rights, must be the Government’s top priority.”

Areas
of the UK with the most people doing part-time work because they cannot
find full-time jobs include London (198,000), the North West (152,000),
the South East (141,000) and the West Midlands (132,000), said the TUC.

Last month it was revealed that 
overall unemployment has fallen for the first time in almost a year. But that still leaves 2.65 million people out of work.

The total dipped by 35,000 in the three months to the end of February, giving a jobless rate of 8.3 per cent.

Employment minister Chris Grayling said the figures were a 'step in the right direction'.

Trapped: Men are are struggling to find full time employment

But as Britain fears a double dip-recession its wealthiest 1,000 people became even richer over the past year.

Bucking the economic downturn the super-rich have so far enjoyed a great 2012, with the combined wealth of the richest 1,000 now standing at a record £414.26 billion, up 4.7 per cent.

The previous high of £412.85 billion in 2008 was set months before the financial crash from which the rest of Britain has yet to fully recover.
