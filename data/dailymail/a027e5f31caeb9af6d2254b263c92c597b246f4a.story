Topless barber: 46-year-old Loveland, Colorado resident Suzette Hall was arrested Wednesday night on suspicion of cutting hair without a license and felony criminal impersonation. Witnesses told police she gives topless haircuts

A 46-year-old grandmother in Loveland, Colorado was arrested earlier this week after allegedly offering topless hair cuts.

Since authorities couldn't find evidence of the Craigslist ads offering nude barbering services, Suzette Hall was arrested for practicing without a license and felony criminal impersonation.

But friends of Hall say she was wrongly accused as part of a ploy by her ex-husband and ex-business partner who wanted her behind bars.

Authorities started investigating Hall when a series of checks bounced for chair rentals at a salon on the 2200 block of Main Street in Longmont, according to the Longmont Times-Call.

It turned out the checks hadn't been signed by Hall, so it was difficult to peg her for check fraud, but she wasn't off the hook.

Police soon found out that Hall was practicing as a hair stylist in Longmont without a license, after being previously ordered to stop working in 2008 for the same reason.

In addition to illegal hairstyling in Longmont, Hall opened a hair salon called Rebel Beauty in nearby Johnstown with a business partner.

But Hall soon left the salon when her co-owner, a woman named Anne, objected to certain business practices.

Witnesses told police that Hall started 'charging $45 for topless haircuts and is advertising on Craigslist'. Police were unable to find the Craigslist advertisements, but it is possible that they were flagged and purged.

The accusation is interesting considering a picture Hall posted to her Facebook in August.

Salon uniform: Hall posted a picture on Facebook which made it seem as if she were wearing nothing. In the caption she wrote that she 'decided to wear nothing but flowers to work today'

In the picture, Hall appears to be wearing nothing, and covers herself up with bouquet of flowers.

'Soooo frckn hot today...decided to wear nothing but flowers to work today...P.S. Never wear thorny roses,' she wrote.

Once Anne found out about the topless haircuts, their business relationship deteriorated.

Police say Anne was 'not comfortable with this and she did not want to have topless haircuts in her business because she is a single mother and...she did not believe this was safe and proper'.

But topless haircuts may have just been the tip of the iceberg. Anne believes Hall went so far as to solicit sex from male customers after noticing a strange man come into the salon, and finding used condoms in the trash later.

Prostitution allegations: Hall co-owned and operated a salon in Johnstown before being pushed out by her business partner who believes she was soliciting money for sex from their male customers

Anne told police that Hall admitted to accepting payment for sex, sometimes going on 'house calls'.

Divorce: Hall's ex-husband told police that she started advertising her services on Craigslist after leaving the salon. Their break-up must have been recent, as she posted this picture of 'My husband!' to Facebook in early October

Eventually, Hall agreed to leave the business and started working freelance as a stylist in Loveland.

Her ex-husband told police that she advertised her services on Craigslist as the 'Rebel Barber' claiming that her license 'was in the mail' and that she had also a applied for 'a nude license of hairstylists'. No such license exists, police confirmed with state regulators.

Hall's break-up with her husband seems to be relatively new. On October 4, she posted a picture of him on her Facebook calling her husband 'one hot Roughneck'. 

Friends say Hall was the target 
of a 'witch hunt' orchestrated by her ex-husband and business 
partner who 'got together and lied to police and tried to get her 
arrested'.

A
man named Jason claiming to be Hall's friend wrote on her Facebook, 
saying that her business is legal as you don't need to have a hair 
styling license to own and operate a salon.

'To
her friends and family...I'm going to clear her name and all this 
slander,' Jason wrote. 'To Ked Hall and Anne as well as all the haters 
out there...F*** you... stay turned folks I'm gonna bust this s*** wide 
open...don't f*** with an American soldier.'

Hall has a pretty lengthy record with nine previous felony convictions including identity theft, motor vehicle theft, felony theft and possession of a weapon by a previous offender. She also has a misdemeanor record.

According to her Facebook profile, Hall is a grandmother, keeps cats and an albino snake as pets, likes country music and bought herself a motorcycle for her birthday.

As of Friday, Hall was being held at the Boulder County Jail on $25,000 bond. 

Grandma: According to her Facebook, 46-year-old Hall is the grandmother to at least one grandson
