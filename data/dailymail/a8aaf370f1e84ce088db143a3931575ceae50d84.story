BP has launched an appeal against "fictitious" and "absurd" oil spill compensation payouts and has asked a judge to temporarily halt the payments being made to businesses on an 'economic loss' basis.

In a New Orleans court filing, BP gave examples of companies in industries far away from the spill and completely unconnected with the coastline that enjoyed bigger profits during the year of the spill in 2010 and yet still received millions in compensation.

The British oil and gas group, which has already sold a substantial part of its business to pay out compensation and fines as a result of the disaster, said it could be 'irreparably harmed' by the payouts because they could cost it 'billions' more than it budgeted for when it agreed to a settlement in April 2012.

Compensation: Deepwater Horizon, off Louisiana in Aprill 2010 - the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history

It reopens a part of the saga that appeared to have been settled almost a year ago when BP agreed terms on economic, property and medical compensation for more than 100,000 individuals and businesses who had filed a class action suit.

At the time of the settlement, BP estimated the bill would be $7.8 billion - already making it one of the biggest settlements of its kind in U.S. history.

The actual amount is uncapped, and dependent on decisions made by Patrick Juneau, a lawyer from Louisiana who administers the payments under a complex set of rules set out by the agreement.

Compensation: BP has already sold a substantial part of its business to pay compensation and fines resulting from the disaster and there is likely to be more to come

As the payments started to flow out, BP realized that the funds it had set aside would be insufficient. At first, it added more, reaching $8.5 billion by the end of 2012, while complaining that the payments to businesses were too generous and the terms of the settlement were being misinterpreted.

The April 2010 spill happened when the Macondo well ruptured and the Deepwater Horizon rig that was working on it exploded and sank. The accident killed 11 men and spouted 4 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico in the United States' worst offshore oil spill.

Last year BP agreed to pay compensation to around 100,000 people and companies - including fishermen and restaurant owners - who claimed the oil spill had harmed their livelihoods or their health.

In its filing, among the examples BP
offered of 'absurd' claims, the British company referred to a $21 
million payment made to a rice mill in Louisiana situated some 40 miles 
from the coast that earned more revenue than in spill year of 2010 than 
in the previous three years.

It
also cited a $9.7 million recompense for a highway, street and bridge 
construction company in northern Alabama, almost 200 miles from the 
Gulf, and which does no business in the region, and for which 2010 was 
its best year on record.

Not adding up: BP set aside $42 billion to deal with compensation claims from businesses that were affected but it says many are simply "fictitious" and "absurd"

BP also referred to a digital printing business and a law firm that had been compensated despite strong profits.

Claimants can demonstrate a loss by choosing to compare 'any consecutive three months from 2010' with 'a large combination of months going back to January 2007.'

The company had set aside $42 billion to pay compensation claims - equivalent to about 30 percent of its stock market value. It has also sold assets worth $38 billion in order the to finance theÂ  compensation, clean-ups and fines.

The company has already promised to pay $37 billion but billions more could be piled on in economic damage claims from Gulf Coast states despite having already agreed in 2012 to pay $4.5bn to settle criminal charges.
