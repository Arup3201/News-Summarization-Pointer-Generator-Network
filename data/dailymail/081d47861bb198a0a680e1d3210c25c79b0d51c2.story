As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign.

MAURO ZARATE IN A NUTSHELL

While Andy Carroll starts another season with injury trouble, West Ham fans need not worry about a repeat of last season's striker-less shows from last season - and the reason to hold early season hope comes from the signing of Argentine striker Mauro Zarate.

The hotheaded centre forward makes his return to England after a brief spell on loan at Birmingham City and whether he's a big success or not at Upton Park he'll definitely be making the headlines after controversial and mixed spells in Italy and Argentina.

Last season Zarate sccored 18 times in 28 games for his boyhood club Velez to finish top scorer in the Argentine Torneo Final.

With a goal every 123 minutes that's not a bad ratio for the Premier League and he should get better service from the likes of Mark Noble at Upton Park.

And his disciplinary issues aren't too bad given his infamous hothead - he picked up just four yellow cards and hopefully he won't replicate that one red in England. 

WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE ZARATE IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM

Sam Allardyce knew as soon as the summer transfer window opened that he needed a striker - and his first move was to steal a march on the rest and snap up Zarate.

One thing about this tricky frontman is he tends to hit the ground running, and with some Premier League experience already under his belt he should be in amongst the goals early at Upton Park.

Back home in Argentina he has been banging in the goals and he already has one in pre season from the Hammers' New Zealand tour.

His huge desire to get the East London club into Europe so he can compete at the levels he once did with Inter Milan, where he made seven Champions League appearances, should drive him on. And when Zarate wants something, he usually gets it - you just have to hope that's positive!

Of course, it could all go the other way: he is known as much for his hothead as his quick feet - but Zarate should get the goals early in the season and if it subsequently goes wrong you can use up one of your first few transfers to bring in a form forward.

BACK IN ENGLAND 

Zarate spent a brief period on loan at Birmingham City back in 2008 but despite becoming a fans' favourite with his explosive displays he couldn't prevent the Blues from being relegated and any chance of a move was shot down.

He had spearheaded a climb away from the relegation zone similar to Carlos Tevez's that famous saved West Ham the season before - and like Tevez, Zarate attracted attention of top clubs. Arsenal were thought to be interested suitors but the striker's Qatari club Al-Sadd wanted £20million and the Gunners were priced out.

During that spell he showed himself off as a two-footed and pacey forward who left defenders in bits - a promising preview to what he could show in claret and blue.

THE DOWNSIDE 

Zarate is a controversial and opinion-splitting character and his performances under Sam Allardyce could go one of two ways depending on what he thinks of his new boss.

He has been seen as selfish with the ball and often attracts controversy, such as in 2010 when he was pictured making what was alleged to be a Nazi salute while at Lazio.

But as earlier stated he tends to get going quickly, so get him in your team before potentially transferring him out if the Argentine is no longer flavour of the month after the first few weeks of the season.

DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT

Sam Allardyce has been talking up Zarate's ability - and the Premier League veteran tends to know a good striker when he sees one.

'He knows the Premier League and now he has become more experienced and more mature, he is going to have evolved in terms of giving us a few more goals in the Premier League when he gets the opportunity,' Allardyce said.

'Hopefully he is going to settle in quickly and bring us those sort of options that we need to be more successful in terms of goalscoring next season.

'He is small and sharp and quick and has got good feet, so hopefully he can give us another dimension.'

HE'S A CHEAP FOR A PROVEN GOALSCORER

At £8.8m Zarate is cheap for someone proven to score Premier League goals in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game.

He might be a bit of a gamble for both you and West Ham but if his latest move pays off you'll be laughing your way to the top of the league - even if that might ask a bit much of the Hammers.
