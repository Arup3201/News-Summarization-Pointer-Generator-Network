A Canadian nun was abducted by a gang of armed kidnappers in the early hours of Saturday while working as a missionary in Cameroon.

Fears are growing for Sister Gilberte Bissiere, as it was revealed that the gunman targeted the 80-year-old and two Italian priests, but left African religious workers behind.

The group had been part of a Catholic mission to help improve water supplies and provide medical help to those with HIV and Aids.

Armed forces in Cameroon are said to be trying to find the kidnappers, but officials have not said who was behind the abduction of Sister Gilberte and priests, Giampaolo Marta and Gianantonio Allegri.

'Doors were broken towards midnight by unknown people and the religious were taken away. We do not know where they are,' Bishop Philippe Stevens said.

'The act is not yet claimed but we imagine who is behind this kidnapping,' the Bishop, who is based in Maroua where the kidnapping took place, added.Â 

An unidentified priest from Vicenza told Vatican Radio the kidnappers seized Sister Gilberte, but left nuns from Cameroon.

Vatican Radio said officials had not ruled out involvement by Islamic fundamentalist group Boko Harem.

The terror group has warned Cameroon to stay out of its fight with the Nigerian 
military, threatening to carry its war for an Islamic state 
into the neighboring country.

Pope Francis is said to be aware of the kidnapping and released a statement saying he 'hopes for a rapid and positive solution to the affair'.

Italy has cautioned against travel to the area, which is 20 miles from the border with Nigeria because of the risk of 'kidnappings due to presence of jihadist elements coming from Nigeria'.

The priests were assigned from the Vicenza diocese in northern Italy. No one has claimed responsibility, diocese officials said.

Father Gianantonio had written to his home diocese last month saying local authorities had advised him to travel with a police escort, the Catholic News Agency reported.

'Even if on the surface you do not notice anything in particular that is alarming, it is palpable in our feelings and our conversations,' he wrote in the letter dated March 12.
