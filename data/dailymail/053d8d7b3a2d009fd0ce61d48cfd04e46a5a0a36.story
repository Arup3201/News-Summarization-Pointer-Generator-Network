TV presenter Mariella Frostrup has revealed the secret of her dream holiday --she borrowed her best friend's boyfriend for the trip.

Mariella says that she asked broadcaster Penny Smith if she could borrow her actor boyfriend Vince Leigh for the canal barge trip.

And she says that the novel loan move was a great success as it saved her holiday from being a disaster after her lawyer husband Jason was forced to pull out of the trip because of work commitments.

Husband sharing: Mariella Frostrup borrowed best friend Penny Smith's (pictured, right) husband for a holiday

Mariella told Waitrose Weekend magazine: ‘I have just returned from a canal boat trip in south-west France with my two children and my best friend's boyfriend. Seriously!

‘Verily I say unto you that I have seen the future and it’s partner sharing.

‘I don't mean in some sordid Seventies throw-your-keys-in-a-bowl sort of way but a modern, squeaky clean, no-sex-please-we're British manifestation.

‘Initially it seemed a disaster when my husband was called away on business and was unable to join us on our much-anticipated trip aboard the beautiful barge Alouette on the 17th century Canal du Midi between Carcassonne and Beziers.

‘So I asked my friend Penny Smith if I could borrow her husband. Enter Vince Leigh, shortly to appear on the West End stage in Ed Hall's brilliant Kinks musical Sunny Afternoon.

‘Luckily rehearsals had not yet begun so this child-friendly, easy on the eye wine-guzzling charmer was mine for the voyage.

‘To say it was an unqualified success would be to undervalue the pleasure of a familiar but not intimate male companion.’

Mariella says that she shared a cabin with her daughter while her son shared with Vince.

‘All in all Vince proved a top-of-the-range companion. Divesting myself of responsibility for another man's peccadillos awaked in me the desire to try harder to do likewise in my own home.

‘So much friction in life is self-induced and down to the minor annoyances and perceived injustices of daily life.

‘My mini-break with Vince has proved the best marriage-enhancer possible. Thanks Penny!’ she said.
