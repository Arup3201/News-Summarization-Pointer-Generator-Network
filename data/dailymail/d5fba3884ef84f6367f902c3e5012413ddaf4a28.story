Fiona Apple has postponed her South American tour so she can take care of her dying 13-year-old pitbull, whom she calls her 'best friend, mother, daughter and the one who taught me how to love'.

In an extraordinary four-page letter posted to her website and Facebook page, the singer explained her decision to forgo her 12-date tour, which was due to start in Brazil next week.

'Here's the thing,' she wrote in the scanned letter. 'I have a 
dog Janet, and she's been ill for almost two years now, as a tumor has 
been idling in her chest, growing ever so slowly.

'I know that she is 
coming close to point where she will stop being a dog, and instead, be 
part of everything. She'll be in the wind, and in the soil, and the snow, and in me, wherever I go.

Best friends: Singer Fiona Apple is pictured walking her dog Janet in 2008. She has now postponed her South American tour to care for the pet, whom she believes is dying

'I can't come to South America, not now. If I go 
away again, I'm afraid she'll die and I won't have the honour of singing
 her to sleep, of escorting her out.'

The poetic letter explains she found Janet in Echo Park in Los Angeles ten years ago 'with a rope around her neck, and bites all over her ears and face' - a sign she had been used as a fighting dog.

But after taking in the four-month-old puppy, Apple realised the dog was in fact a 'pacifist' who went on to provide 'the most consistent relationship of my adult life'.

'We've lived in numerous houses, and jumped a few make shift families, but it's always really been the two of us,' she wrote.

'Please understand': Apple was due to perform 12 dates across South America starting next week

The dog gave her support 'every time I was  heartbroken, or spirit-broken, or just lost' and sat beside her as she wrote and recorded four albums, Apple explained.

But recently, Janet has slowed. She suffers from Addison's disease, an adrenal deficiency, and requires regular injections of Cortisol. Two years ago, veterinarians found a tumor in her chest.

'When I got back from the last leg of the US tour, there was a big, big difference. She doesn't even want to go for walks anymore,' she wrote. 'I just can't leave her now, please understand.'

She concluded her letter by explaining that, although she often takes 20 minutes to choose which socks to wear, the decision to drop out of the tour was easy.

'These are the choices we make, which 
define us,' Apple explained. 'I am not the woman who puts her career 
ahead of love and friendship.

'I am asking for your blessing. I'll be seeing you.'

She was scheduled to perform three concerts in Brazil next week, then travel to Argentina and Mexico, but fans put aside their disappointment to commend Apple for her decision.

'It is clear that the bond you have with Janet is one 
that deserves to be treasured,' fan Lauren King wrote on Facebook. 'I commend you for making the right, but 
probably most difficult choice. It speaks volumes about your character.'

Olga de Oliveira added: 'Dear Fiona, we're so sad reading this, 'cause many of us are waiting for your concert since 1996. But be sure, 99 per cent of your Brazilian fans are with you, wishing you all the best. Your heart is exactly where it should be.'

Back on track: Apple, pictured performing in Florida, began touring this year after a five-year hiatus

Apple released her debut album, Tidal, in 1996. She stopped touring in 2007 but returned earlier this year with the release of her fourth album, snappily entitled The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do.

In September, the 35-year-old singer was arrested after police found hashish and marijuana on her tour bus at a West Texas border patrol checkpoint.

She spent the night in Sierra Blanca and was released the following day after posting $10,000 bail.

It's 6pm on Friday, and I'm writing to a few thousand friends I have not met yet. I am writing to ask them to change our plans and meet a little while later.

Here's the thing.

I have a dog Janet, and she's been ill for almost two years now, as a tumor has been idling in her chest, growing ever so slowly. She's almost 14 years old now. I got her when she was 4 months old. I was 21 then, an adult officially - and she was my child.

She is a pitbull, and was found in Echo Park, with a rope around her neck, and bites all over her ears and face. She was the one the dogfighters use to puff up the confidence of the contenders.

She's almost 14 and I've never seen her start a fight, or bite, or even growl, so I can understand why they chose her for that awful role. She's a pacifist.

Janet has been the most consistent relationship of my adult life, and that is just a fact. We've lived in numerous houses, and jumped a few make shift families, but it's always really been the two of us.

She slept in bed with me, her head on the pillow, and she accepted my hysterical, tearful face into her chest, with her paws around me, every time I was heartbroken, or spirit-broken, or just lost, and as years went by, she let me take the role of her child, as I fell asleep, with her chin resting above my head.

She was under the piano when I wrote songs, barked any time I tried to record anything, and she was in the studio with me all the time we recorded the last album.

The last time I came back from tour, she was spry as ever, and she's used to me being gone for a few weeks every 6 or 7 years.

She has Addison's Disease, which makes it dangerous for her to travel since she needs regular injections of Cortisol, because she reacts to stress and to excitement without the physiological tools which keep most of us from literally panicking to death.

Despite all of this, she’s effortlessly joyful and playful, and only stopped acting like a puppy about 3 years ago.

She's my best friend and my mother and my daughter, my benefactor, and she's the one who taught me what love is.

I can't come to South America. Not now. When I got back from the last leg of the US tour, there was a big, big difference. She doesn't even want to go for walks anymore.

I know that she's not sad about aging or dying. Animals have a survival instinct, but a sense of mortality and vanity, they do not. That’s why they are so much more present than people.

But I know that she is coming close to point where she will stop being a dog, and instead, be part of everything. She’ll be in the wind, and in the soil, and the snow, and in me, wherever I go.

I just can't leave her now, please understand. If I go away again, I’m afraid she'll die and I won't have the honor of singing her to sleep, of escorting her out.

Sometimes it takes me 20 minutes to pick which socks to wear to bed. But this decision is instant.These are the choices we make, which define us.

I will not be the woman who puts her career ahead of love and friendship. I am the woman who stays home and bakes Tilapia for my dearest, oldest friend. And helps her be comfortable, and comforted, and safe, and important.

Many of us these days, we dread the death of a loved one. It is the ugly truth of Life, that keeps us feeling terrified and alone.

I wish we could also appreciate the time that lies right beside the end of time.

I know that I will feel the most overwhelming knowledge of her, and of her life and of my love for her, in the last moments. I need to do my damnedest to be there for that.

Because it will be the most beautiful, the most intense, the most enriching experience of life I've ever known.

When she dies.

So I am staying home, and I am listening to her snore and wheeze, and reveling in the swampiest, most awful breath that ever emanated from an angel.

And I am asking for your blessing.I'll be seeing you.

Love, Fiona
