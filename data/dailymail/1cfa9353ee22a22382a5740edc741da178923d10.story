A fast food worker in Colombia is believed to be under investigation by police after playing a cruel prank on an elderly man.

Video footage taken on a cellphone has surfaced from the grilled chicken restaurant in Sabaneta, an area outside the city of Medelin, showing an employee hosing down the man from behind the counter.

The victim appears intoxicated and is mumbling to himself.

However, when another employee pushes the old man from behind, he falls 
head-first into the serving counter and is knocked unconscious.
