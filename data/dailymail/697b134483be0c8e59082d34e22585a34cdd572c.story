Uber is investigating one of its executives over allegations that he tracked a reporter without her knowledge, according to a recent report.

Buzzfeed claims that Josh Mohrer, Uber's New York general manager, tracked technology reporter Johana Bhuiyan on two occasions using a feature known as 'God View'.

God View is available to all employees at the car-sharing service and allows them to see customer activity, such as where a person wants to be picked up.

The allegation, which Buzzfeed claims came from two former Uber employees, follows a meeting in November at Uber's New York headquarters.

According to the news site, when Ms Bhuiyan arrived at the meeting, Mr Mohrer said: 'There you are…I was tracking you.'

However, Ms Bhuiyan had never granted permission for Mr Mohrer  to follow her using the tool.

Two months earlier, Ms Bhuiyan had asked about  competitor Lyft, and Mr Mohrer had emailed her logs of some of her Uber trips.

While Uber would not comment on the allegation, it is understood that the company is now investigating Mr Mohrer.

'Our data privacy policy applies to all employees: access to and use of data is permitted only for legitimate business purposes,' a spokesperson for Uber told MailOnline.

'Data security specialists monitor and audit that access on an ongoing basis. Violations of this policy do result in disciplinary action, including the possibility of termination and legal action.'  

The news follows another incident this week in which a senior executive at Uber made a grovelling apology after suggesting putting a team together to dig up dirt on journalists who criticise his company.

Emil Michael, who made the remarks at a private dinner in Manhattan, said he had dreamed up an eight-man team who would find out about writers' personal lives and families so that Uber could discredit them.

Target: He was speaking with specific reference to Sarah Lacy (left), editor of PandoDaily, who recently wrote about deleting her Uber app after the firm teamed up with an apparent escort service in France

The scheme was targeted at a particular Silicon Valley female editor who has savaged the company for its alleged 'sexism and misogyny' - but drew an outraged backlash when it became public. 

A chorus of disapproval aimed at Michael prompted a humiliating public apology to Sarah Lacy, the editor of PandoDaily, in which he disowned the idea entirely.

Mr Michael posted an apology to Lacy's Twitter account, saying: 'I would like to apologise to you directly. My comments were wrong and I deeply regret them.

'Neither me [sic] nor my company would ever engage in such activities. Again, I apologize.' 

The remarks will do little to improve Uber's fragile relationship with the media following the portrayal of its management team as insensitive and aggressive toward customer complaints.

Venue: During the dinner party at Manhattan's Waverly Inn (pictured), Michael was reportedly asked about the firm's depictions in the press. In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, it is claimed

Under-fire: Ashton Kutcher has entered the firestorm surrounding taxi-hiring app Uber

Ashton Kutcher has entered the firestorm surrounding under-fire taxi-hiring app Uber and defended controversial comments made by an executive who suggested spending $1 million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize the company.

Kutcher, an investor in the app, took to Twitter on Wednesday to show his support for beleaguered VP Emil Michael and described Sarah Lacy, a female journalist who has been highly critical of the company, as 'shady'. 

'What is so wrong about digging up dirt on shady journalist?' tweeted the celebrity tech entrepreneur who has invested in tech firms including Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb and Spotify through his venture capital firm A-Grade. 

So as long as journalist are interested and willing to print half truths as facts... Yes we should question the source' he continued in a series of tweets before he sought to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not Uber.

'This should be fun... Here comes the part where journalist explain why they should be exempt from ridicule and judgement and probing...' he continued.

And, indeed, the apology did not stop Lacy from writing a scathing opinion piece on PandoDaily, in which she said the plan was 'like a five-year-old pretending to be Frank Underwood' - a reference to Kevin Spacey's scheming politician character in Netflix series House of Cards.

According to Ms Lacy, Michael also called her cell phone and ask to speak in private, but hung up after she refused to have an off-the-record conversation.  

Mr Michael's plan came up when he was asked about the firm's negative press coverage.

In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15 billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, according to BuzzFeed.

The eight-strong hit team would investigate 'your personal lives, your families' with a view to discrediting journalists behind unfavorable reports on the taxi service, he said.

Mr Michael was especially focused on Ms Lacy, who also recently accused Uber of 'sexism and misogyny' on her Silicon Valley website, writing: 'The company simply doesn't respect us or prioritize our safety.'

Apology: Michael, who used to work at Klout and also sits on a board advising the Department of Defense, later took to Twitter to apologize for his comments to Lacy herself, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly'

Contradicting his remarks: He added: 'Neither me nor my company would ever engage in such activities'

He reportedly expressed anger over her claims that, responding that women are far more likely to suffer assault at the hands of normal taxi drivers than Uber drivers.

In a statement to BuzzFeed on Monday evening, he said he believed he was speaking off the record and that his remarks did not reflect his nor Uber's views.

'The remarks attributed to me at a private dinner - borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what I feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company I am proud to work for - do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company's views or approach,' he said.

'They were wrong no matter the circumstance and I regret them.'  

At no point during the dinner did Michael suggest the firm has already hired opposition researchers.

An Uber spokesman confirmed that the company does not carry out such research and has never considered doing it because it would be a 'clear violation of our privacy and data access policies'.

The event at Waverly Inn on Friday evening was attended by a number of high-profile figures, including actor Ed Norton and publisher Arianna Huffington.

Response: On Monday, Ms Lacy responded to BuzzFeed's article on her site (pictured), saying: 'Companies shouldn't be allowed to go to illegal lengths to defame and silence reporters'

It comes as a legal battle between Nevada's highly regulated taxi industry and Uber stumbled into complications as two state judges laid claim to hearing the same case.

In court on Monday, Clark County District Judge Douglas Herndon blamed the overlap on the state attorney general, who represents the Nevada Taxicab Authority and Nevada Transportation Authority.

'I think you're jumping around to different jurisdictions trying to get a ruling,' he said. 

The state regulators want to put an end to Uber, which launched its ride-sharing services in Las Vegas, Reno and Carson City on October 24.

Hours after the service was launched, the state hastily sought orders to halt the company's business in all three cities. The attorney general later filed a complaint and motions in Washoe County.

On Monday, Uber asked the state Supreme Court to put a halt to the  case.

The company expects a decision in several days.
