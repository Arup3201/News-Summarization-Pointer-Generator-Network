A law firm invented scores of 'touching' love stories about foreign couples to convince immigration authorities that their sham marriages were real, a court heard yesterday.

Solicitor Tevfick Souleiman and three immigration advisers working for him made 'substantial' sums by forging documents to hoodwink the UK Border Agency during the eight year scam, it was alleged.

Brides were flown into Britain from eastern European EU countries to marry non-EU citizens, giving the grooms rights to live and work in the UK, the Old Bailey was told.

In some cases the couples only met 
each other at the solicitor's office on one occasion before their 
wedding day and were banned from any other contact, prosecutor Nicholas 
Mather said.

But the firm organised forged 
affidavits in which they 'concocted' accounts of their supposedly 
romantic courtships which were submitted to the authorities in order for
 the marriages to be approved, he said.

In one, Albanian Alban Spaho, 
described how he met his Bulgarian bride-to-be Petya Zlatanska while on a
 day out with friends in Haringey, North London in 2008 and plucked up 
the courage approach her.

The affidavit said: 'We went to a cafe
 where our friends left us alone to get on with it... Petya was a bit 
shy but I eventually persuaded her to let me take her out.

'We didn't go to any of the usual 
Bulgarian or Albanian places in North London but instead went to a 
really nice place in the West end.'

He described how the couple's love 
grew and they moved in together, adding: 'After three months I realised I
 wanted to be with her all the time and asked her to marry me.'

In fact the letter was a 'script' written by staff at the north London offices of Souleiman GA Solicitors, the prosecutor said.

In another allegedly forged affidavit a
 sham marriage groom described how he met his bride a nightclub and 
after they got together, he eventually proposed after a romantic meal on
 Valentine's Day.

One Indian student who wanted to stay 
in the UK told how he was introduced to his Bulgarian bride to be at the
 firm's offices when he went to ask for immigration advice

He was taken outside to have some 
photos of them together taken, before being told he couldn't talk to her
 until the day of their marriage, it was alleged.

The marriages were going ahead despite
 the regular use of same addresses and a number of errors on 
applications including names of the applicants being misspelt, the jury 
heard.

The solicitor's firm also used forged tenancy agreements and employer's references, many from a company called Kebab Town.

Mr Mather said: 'They, together with 
others, were part of a conspiracy to breach immigration laws in this 
country by arranging sham marriages, or marriages of convenience.

'In doing so, they made a sizeable amount of money. The arrangement of these marriages was a lucrative business.

'Whatever may be recorded in the 
books, substantial sums were being paid to individuals to arrange these 
marriages. This was a cash business.'

Mr Mather said other work of the solicitors, such as conveyancing, was legitimate.

But he added: 'They were running not only a business but also a racket involving sham marriages.

'Substantial amounts would be paid 
into personal bank accounts. Clients would pay the firm Â£500 in 
accounts, but the actual sum was thousands of pounds. That money never 
went through the books.'

Souleiman, 39, immigration advisers 
Zafer Altinbas, 38, and Cenk Guclu, 41, and Furrah Kosimov, 29, deny 
conspiracy to breach immigration law between 2004 and last year.

Souleiman, from Hatfield, 
Hertfordshire, Altinbas, from Islington, north London, and Guclu, from 
Enfield, north London, also deny receiving proceeds of crime.

Kosimov, from Wembley, north west London, who is being tried in his absence, denies money laundering.
