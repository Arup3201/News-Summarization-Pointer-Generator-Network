Glitz, glamour and the popemobile have been shunned by the notoriously frugal Pope Francis, who has revealed he will now drive a 1984 Renault 4.

The clunky five-seater is a throwback to the pontiff's old car in his native Argentina.

Vocal about his preference for a humble lifestyle, the spiritual leader has announced he will drive the 29-year-old white manual whenever he can get away from his predecessor's flashy bullet-proof ride.

Rev Renzo Zocca calls the 29-year-old banger a 'French farmers' car. It is like the one Pope Francis had in Argentina

Pope Benedict XVI - and Vatican security - preferred the bullet-proof Mercedes popemobile to this rusty ride

The second-hand Renault was a present from Reverand Renzo Zocca, a priest from Northern Italy, who used it to drive children to play groups.

He handed it to Pope Francis at an informal event yesterday.

Rev Zocca refers to the old banger, which has 190,000 miles on the clock, as 'the car of French farmers'.

And news has emerged that the Vatican is not impressed by the gift.

Rev. Zocca told Italian magazine Famiglia Cristiana: 'The security guard standing next to me was really worried because he knew that from now on he’ll be going around the Vatican in my car.'

It is not the first stir Pope Francis has caused since he was chosen to serve in February.

Atheists won’t face eternal damnation after all, he declared yesterday, as long as they are morally upstanding.

In an extraordinary open letter, Pope Francis indicated that well-behaved non believers are not in fact committing a sin.

He wrote: ‘What matters for those who don’t believe is to follow their conscience.

‘Sin only happens when those who don’t have faith go against their conscience.’

The letter, published in the Italian newspaper La Repubblica, was responding to a question posed in an editorial by the paper in July. 'Will God forgive those who do not believe in him? 'it asked.

The pontiff’s seemingly softened line on atheists is at odds with Catholic doctrine stating that only believers will be saved.

Earlier this year Vatican spokesman Padre Rosica insisted ‘all salvation comes from Christ, the Head, through the Church which is his body.

Quoting from doctrine in the Cathechism, he said: ‘Hence they cannot be saved who, knowing the Church as founded by Christ and necessary for salvation, would refuse to enter her or remain in her.

Since his appointment in April Francis has repeatedly reached out to non-believers. On Ash Wednesday he washed the feet of a Muslim woman in a juvenile detention centre. And on Tuesday he suggested converting empty convents into homes for refugees.

The u-turn comes as the Pope’s new deputy signalled that the Vatican could also be softening its stance towards married priests.

Professor Richard Dawkins has regularly spoken out against religion and is a prominent atheist

Incoming Secretary of State Pietro Parolin told Venezuelan newspaper El Universal that the tradition of priestly 'celibacy is not dogma', or a law of divine origin, and is therefore open to discussion.

'While the church is not a democratic institution, it needs to reflect the democratic spirit of the times and adopt a collegial way of governing.' he said.
