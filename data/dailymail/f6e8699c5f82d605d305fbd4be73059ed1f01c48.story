Coronation Street star Michael Le Vell fears he will be permanently written out of the soap even if he is acquitted of child sex offences, a friend revealed today.

The actor is convinced his character Kevin Webster will be 'quietly sidelined' after 30 years on screen regardless of the outcome of his trial.

The friend said Le Vell is tormented by the thought his one and only job as the popular garage mechanic 'could be his last'.

Tough going: A friend of Michael Le Vell says the star is worried he will never work on Coronation Street again regardless of whether he is cleared of child sex charges

He is currently suspended from the ITV 
show pending the case in which he strenuously denies 19 counts of sexual
offences, including six of raping a child.

The friend told The Daily Mirror: 'He says he can't imagine the executives welcoming him back with a big blockbuster storyline after weeks of lurid court details.

Struggling: Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell, who has been charged with 19 child sex offences, looked tearful as he left Manchester Magistrates Court last week

'He believes Kevin could very well be finished and will be quietly sidelined and then written out.

'He says that he just wishes he could fast forward to his trial so he can show the nation he is innocent and get on with the rest of his life.

'But even that is uncertain because he is convinced his career as Kevin Webster is over - whether he is found guilty or not.'

According to a close friend, the 
stressed-out star, 48, has also lost more than half a stone after living
on beans on toast and takeaways while on bail.

He is said to have been drowning his sorrows in his local pub, The Railway in Hale, Greater Manchester.

The friend said the Weatherfield star, real name Michael Turner, was devastated when told Kevin would be temporarily written out while he fought the charges, but 'understands that ITV's hands are tied'.

A Corrie source said of Le Vell's fears he would be axed from the soap: 'No one here has given him any cause to feel that way or have those concerns.'

An ITV spokesman said: 'Given the serious nature of these charges, Michael Le Vell will not be appearing in Coronation Street pending the outcome of legal proceedings. It would not be appropriate for us to comment further.'

MailOnline has contacted the actor's legal team for a comment.

Earlier this week Le Vell was smiling as he left his local pub, and gave onlookers a thumbs-up, just days after he had looked looked tired and emotional before he appeared in court charged with sexual offences against a child.

The 48-year-old appeared happy as he left The Railway pub, in Hale, Cheshire.

After leaving the pub on Friday he appeared to whistle and smile as he visited a bookmakers and then headed home.

Last week he had stood in the dock before a packed courtroom. Appearing under his real name, Michael 
Turner, the soap star arrived for an eight-minute hearing at Manchester 
City Magistrates’ Court, just a few hundred yards from the Granada 
Studios where he has filmed for the past 30 years.

Charges: Le Vell is charged with 19 sexual offences against a child including rape, indecent assault and sexual activity

Le Vell is charged with 19 sexual offences against a child including rape, indecent assault and sexual activity.

The alleged sex offences all relate to 
one child and took place between 2001 and 2010, the court was told. Le 
Vell arrived flanked by minders and stood in the glass-panelled dock.

The father-of-two, who wore a light grey 
suit, white shirt and black tie, spoke only to confirm his name, address
and date of birth.

District Judge Khalid Qureshi asked 
Richard Gowthorpe, defending, if there was any indication of plea, to 
which Mr Gowthorpe replied: ‘No indication of plea other than the fact 
that the charges are contested, and will be fully contested in the crown
court.’

Le Vell was bailed 
on condition that he surrenders his passport, does not contact witnesses
and does not have unsupervised contact with any child under the age of 
14.

He left court looking 
tearful and distressed as members of the public looked on. The actor was
first arrested at his £750,000 home in Hale in September 
2011 after a teenage girl claimed he had sexually assaulted her.

But three months later, after a police
investigation, prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to take
the allegations to court.

At
the time Le Vell said he was ‘delighted’ to have been ‘completely 
exonerated’ and was said to be relieved he was able to continue his 
Coronation Street career.

He
thanked police for their ‘thorough investigation’ and expressed his 
gratitude to fans and the Coronation Street cast for their loyal support
during ‘a most difficult and upsetting phase in my life’. Le Vell 
returned to the show after a short break and was recently involved in 
some of its main storylines.

But last month it was announced that after a review of the 
evidence, he had been charged with 19 sex offences. At the time Le Vell,
who split from Janette Beverley, his wife of 25 years, last year, said 
he intended to fight all the charges ‘vigorously’.

Le Vell is due to appear at Manchester Crown Court this month.
