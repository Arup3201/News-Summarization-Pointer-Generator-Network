A person was paid $477,00 for tripping down a flight of stairs in Canada

Australian travellers getting  in to tricky situations overseas are bailing themselves out with the help of six figure insurance claims.

Medical mishaps caused by accident-prone travellers are seeing the number of claims  rise, and it appears there's a widening disparity between the accident itself and the sums paid.

Figures released by Southern Cross Travel Insurance show some of the staggering claims Australians have made overseas, which include a holiday maker's $447,000 win for tripping down a flight of stairs. 

The traveller required multiple surgeries for a broken black an internal bleeding - a much larger procedure than a  holiday maker to Hawaii who was paid $82,000 to treat sand fly bites in a local hospital.

Other accident-prone travellers making hefty claims include one who was paid $70,000 for falling in a US car park and was taken to hospital for a broken wrist.

The victim was taken to a local clinic but needed to be evacuated to a secondary hospital by air, resulting in compounding medical costs.

Fracture ankles, requiring surgery, have also accounted for large insurance payouts overseas

1. $447,000 - fell down stairs in Canada suffering subdural hematoma and an unstable fracture of a cervical vertebrae requiring multiple surgeries.

2. $176,000 - suffered aspiration pneumonia secondary to an epileptic seizure in China.

3. $137,000 - heart attack in Canada requiring bypass surgery.

4. $107,000 - suffered a fractured ankle requiring surgery in USA.

5. $62,400 - on a motorbike travelling in Thailand and hit by truck.

6. $82,000 - hospitalisation required after being bitten by sand flies in Hawaii

7. $74,000 - admitted to hospital in USA suffering vomiting and diarrhoea.

8. $79,000 - suffered a stroke while travelling in USA and admitted to hospital.

9. $70,000 - fell in a car park in USA and suffered a fractured wrist which necessitated an air evacuation to a second hospital for surgery

10. $40,000 - admitted to hospital in Singapore suffering a subarachnoid haemorrhage.

A pneumonia patient who fell ill and started suffering epileptic seizures in china cost their travel company $176,000, while a heart attack patient requiring bypass surgery was issued a $136,000 lump sum.

Mitchell Watson from financial research firm Canstar said paying less than   $50 for travel insurance was a no 'brainer' considering the amount it covers. 

'Small accidents can result in big claims,' Mr Watson told The Australian. 

Craig Morrison, SCTI CEO, said any requirement for medical attention overseas can quickly add up, particularly in the US and Canada.

The US, followed by Thailand, England, France and Canada were the most expensive countries for claims lodged by Australian travellers.

Mr Morrison said  those that travel without insurance are extremely vulnerable to a large unpaid financial liability.

'Sometimes hospitals in US request a deposit prior to treatment and this can be several thousand dollars, sometimes as high as $10,000,' he said.

'This is one of the key areas where having travel insurance is really important as we can try to help eliminate the need to pay this deposit.'

'If you end up in a US hospital and are asked to pay a deposit you should immediately call your travel insurer's emergency assistance number.'
