England resume their Euro 2016 qualification campaign on Friday night when they host Lithuania at Wembley.

Roy Hodgson's side go into the game as overwhelming favourites having won all four of their previous matches in Group E.

In contrast, Lithuania have collected six points from a possible 12 - with their last result seeing them on the receiving end of a 4-0 thrashing away to Switzerland in November last year.
