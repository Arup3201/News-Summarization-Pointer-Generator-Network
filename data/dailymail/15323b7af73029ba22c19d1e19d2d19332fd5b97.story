A starving dog savaged a  pensioner to death in his back garden after being attracted  by the smell of a meat stew  he was cooking, a court heard yesterday.

Clifford Clarke, 79, suffered  horrific injuries in the 15-minute attack by the bull mastiff-type dog, which had not been fed or watered for two days.

As the retired hospital porter screamed: ‘Get off me, get off me’, neighbours ran to the scene. One armed himself with a golf club and, leaning over a fence, tried in vain to beat the animal off.Police marksmen eventually shot it dead.

The court was told the dog, called Charlie, was so crazed that it tried to bite the end of a policeman’s rifle and, after being shot once, it got up and tried to attack again.

their dog Charlie, a Presa Canario, mauled neighbour Clifford Clarke, 79, to death

Mauled: Clifford Clarke, from Clubmoor, 
Liverpool,  was savagely attacked in his garden by his neighbours' 
starving dog Charlie after he left his back door open while cooking meat. The dog hadn't eaten for 45 hours

Mr Clarke, a former athlete, of Clubmoor, Liverpool, died later in hospital of multiple injuries and blood loss.

Yesterday the dog’s owners, Hayley Sulley, 30, and her partner Della Woods, 30, were jailed for 12 months. The dog was one of three penned into a neighbouring back garden without shade, food or water while Sulley and Wood went to a barbecue.

Tests later revealed it had not been fed or watered for at least 45 hours before the killing on a hot day in May last year.

Liverpool Crown Court was told that the couple’s dogs were so hungry they had tried to eat their plastic food bowl and ate cigarette butts, bird food and dirty water.

Eventually the dogs broke free and Charlie charged into the garden of Mr Clarke, who had left his back door open.

The court heard that the ‘out of  control’ Presa Canario-cross – a breed not banned in the UK – attacked the former soldier, tearing one arm off and mauling the other.

One police officer described the incident as ‘the worst thing I have  ever seen’.

Judge Mark Brown said Mr Clarke suffered a ‘very shocking, appalling’ death. He told Sulley and Woods that they were fortunate not to have been charged with manslaughter under new legal guidelines that have been brought in since the incident.

These could have seen them face up to 14 years in jail.

The maximum sentence he could have imposed was two years. Judge Brown said he had taken into account their guilty pleas. Sulley and Woods admitted a charge of allowing a dog to enter a place where it injured a person and three counts of  causing unnecessary suffering.

They were also banned from owning dogs. The court heard that Sulley, who has a seven-year-old daughter, and Woods, who has an eight-year-old son, were extremely remorseful.

Guilty: Woods (second left) and Sulley (second right) had left the dog unattended in the garden on a hot day last May without water and shade while they went to a barbecue

that Charlie and another dog had escaped from Sulley’s garden minutes 
before and had wandered into Mr Clarke’s garden and attacked him

Judge Brown added: ‘He suffered a horrific death and you have taken away from his family the love and companionship he would have provided.’

After the case Mr Clarke’s brother, Kenny, 71, said: ‘It must have been the most horrific death in peacetime.

‘But while I can’t bring my brother back I think we must make sure this does not  happen again.’

Figures released recently show that the number of dangerous dogs seized by the police have risen 50 per cent in just two years in some police force areas.

Tougher penalties were introduced in England and Wales in May following a series of horrific deaths by out-of-control dogs.

The maximum prison sentence for allowing a dog to carry out a fatal attack on a person has been increased to 14 years from  two years.

Allowing a dog to cause injury can now be punished by five years in prison, up from a  previous maximum of two years.
