The three women who were held captive and sexually abused in a Cleveland home for a decade have returned to the 'House of Horrors' in an extraordinary show of bravery.

On Friday morning, Michelle Knight visited to Ariel Castro's home, where she was held from August 2002 until her escape on May 6, so that she could thank neighbors for their support.

Amanda Berry and her father also returned to the home on Tuesday to thank those who helped her when she fled for safety, and Gina DeJesus also visited Seymour Street this week, 19ActionNews reported.

Knight's visit came as it emerged her captor will start his term - a life sentence plus 1,000 years - isolated from other inmates.

A spokeswoman for Ohio's prisons 
department said Castro won't go into general population once he enters 
the state's prison system. She says it's for his own protection because 
of his high profile.

At his sentencing on Thursday, Knight told him: 'You took 11 years of my life away, 
but now I have it back. I spent 11 years in hell. Now
 your hell is just beginning.'

As part of Castro's plea agreement, the Seymour Avenue house will be torn down in the near future.

Castro was sentenced after pleading guilty to 937 counts including kidnapping, rape and murder.

Graphic
 and disturbing evidence was heard during the four-and-a-half-hour 
hearing, with Castro himself giving a deluded version of events in which
 he denied raping or beating his three victims.

Castro said: 'As God as my witness I never beat these women, I never tortured them. These women were not virgins when I met them, all three of them'

Standing in an orange jumpsuit, 
Castro shocked the packed courtroom by stating there was 'a lot of 
harmony' in the house where he trapped and abused the three women.

The 53-year-old blamed his behavior on the violence he suffered as a child and his addiction to sex.

The detective in charge of the case 
described how Castro abducted the three women, took them to his home and
 immediately tied them in chains in the basement and raped them.

He put a motorbike helmet on each girl and left them in the dark basement overnight, Detective Harasimchuk said.

'Each
 woman told me they were repeatedly sexually, physically and emotionally
 abused by Ariel Castro during the entire time they were in captivity,' 
he said.

Dr Frank Ochberg described to the court the long-term impact the continuous abuse will have on the victims.

He described their 'terror-induced states of mind, 
defilement, dehumanization and how they were treated like animals and 
deprived of their sense of self and dignity'.

'They have life sentences. They will never be free of the damage done,' he told the court.

FBI agent Andrew Burke described the moment he saw the girls as 'surreal' as they were so pale and malnourished.

'I'll never forget it,' he said. 'It 
was surreal to me. I had been involved in the missing persons 
investigations for quite some time.'

He talked the court through pictures 
of inside the home, describing how the back door was equipped with an 
alarm, a bedspread separated the kitchen and living area, a porch swing 
obstructed a flight of stairs and a curtain was put over the stairs 
leading to the area where the women were held.

Clutter: The rooms inside the Castro home are strewn with discarded clothes, toys and shabby furniture, with children's drawings decorating the pink walls

Bedroom windows were boarded shut from the inside with heavy closet 
doors and doorknobs had been removed and replaced with multiple locks, 
he said.

The house was divided in ways to make it more secure and to 
hide the existence of rooms, he said.

Authorities also found a 
'significant amount' of cash in a washing machine in the basement, the 
same room as the pole the women were chained to while he raped them.

On occasion, Castro would throw the 
money at the women after sexually abusing them and require  they pay him
 to pick up any special items for them when he left the house, the agent
 said.

He would also force them to hold a gun to his head and dare them to shoot him in a sick game of Russian Roulette. 

Castro has admitted that on one 
occasion Knight told him she may be pregnant and he forced a termination
 by putting her on a tea-only diet for several days, made her perform 
'knee bends' and jumping jacks.

However, when Berry fell pregnant, 
Knight helped save the baby's life as Castro threatened to kill her if 
the child did not survive.

'It
 was Michelle who served as doctor, nurse, midwife and pediatrician 
during the birth. She breathed life into that infant when she wasn't 
breathing,' wrote Dr Ochberg.

'At
 other times, she interceded when Castro sought to abuse Gina, 
interposing herself and absorbing physical and sexual trauma. But each 
survivor had a will to prevail and used that will to live through the 
ordeal.'

A memorandum
 also describes how Castro controlled the movements of the women, 
keeping them in locked rooms and using physical restraints.

'There is only one bathroom in the 
house, on the first floor. The Defendant would not allow the victims 
downstairs to use the bathroom. They only had access to plastic toilets 
in the bedrooms. They were emptied infrequently.'

Admission: Ariel Castro wrote a letter saying he was a sexual predator who needed help but did not bother to get it

The
 document adds: 'He controlled the temperature and the inflow of food 
and drink. He used the cold of the basement and the heat of the attic as
 punishment techniques.'

Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Detective Dave Jacobs said he talked with 
Castro a few days after the women escaped and that Castro said, 'I knew 
what I did was wrong.'

Detective Harasimchuk also told the court all three girls were vaginally, orally and anally raped throughout their time in captivity.

He
 said all three women were abducted after Castro offered them a ride and
 that each was chained in his basement and sexually assaulted within a 
few hours of being kidnapped.

Castro lured one of the women into 
his Cleveland home with the promise of a puppy for her son and tricked 
another by saying she could see his daughter.

He chained his captives by their 
ankles, fed them only one meal a day and provided plastic toilets in 
their bedrooms that were infrequently emptied, the filing said.

He menaced them with a gun, 
threatened them with tales of other captives, some of whom hadn't made 
it home, and at one point locked all of them in a vehicle in his garage 
for three days while he had a visitor.

Castro claimed he didn't have an exit
 strategy from his complicated double life and finally gave the women a 
chance to escape by leaving a door unlocked, the court filing said.

The women, each kidnapped separately 
when they accepted a ride from Castro on Cleveland's blue-collar west 
side, quickly escaped after Amanda Berry kicked out the door panel on 
May 6 and Castro was arrested within hours.

The women disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004, when they were 14, 16 and 20 years.
