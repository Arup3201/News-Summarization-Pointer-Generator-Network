Jose Mourinho might have spent Saturday evening winding up Chelsea's fans, but the Blues supporters proved him wrong in Maribor. 

The Chelsea boss was frustrated with level of support at Stamford Bridge against QPR but the away support in Slovenia were loud enough to match a chainsaw. 

‘I think it’s getting worse,’ Mourinho said on Saturday of the atmosphere in West London, shaking his head. ‘When comparing to my previous time I think it’s getting worse.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho slammed their team's support against QPR on Saturday

642 Chelsea supporters travelled to Slovenia to watch their side draw 1-1 at Maribor on Wednesday

‘I can clearly say we are the team to get less support in home matches. I don’t question the passion and the love - I’m nobody to question that and I know clearly that’s not true.

‘Chelsea fans show us their passion for this club every day, but there is a certain line of living (way of behaving) at the matches at Stamford Bridge. 

‘The team then starts playing like it’s a quiet, soft game at home.’ 

Just 642 Chelsea fans had tickets for Wednesday's game but they racked up a decibel reading of 92 in Maribor - not far below the level of a rock concert.

The travelling supporters racked up a 92 decibel rating against Maribor - almost as loud as a rock concert 

And ironically the highest volume came from chants of 'Jose, give us a song' and 'Sing up Mourinho' from the travelling support. 

Unfortunately 'The Special One' didn't oblige with a ditty of his own - although given his team's performance it was maybe acceptable.

The Blues underperformed on matchday four, with fans frustrated by the lack of effort shown.

The Blues manager said he felt his team get  'less support in home matches' than Premier League rivals do

And that was amplified by Mourinho's players at the end of the game, with only Petr Cech and John Terry walking over to applaud the fans at full-time.

Captain Terry was left to call his own team-mates over to the travelling fans as the likes of Didier Drogba, Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa headed straight for the tunnel.

Luckily, Chelsea still lead the group on eight points - with a win in their next game at Schalke guaranteeing qualification.
