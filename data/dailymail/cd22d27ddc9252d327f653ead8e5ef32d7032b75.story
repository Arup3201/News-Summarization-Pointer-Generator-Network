Middlesbrough's Patrick Bamford has been named the Championship Player of the Year at The Football League Awards.

Bamford, on loan at the Riverside Stadium from Chelsea, received the award at the gala ceremony in London on Sunday evening in front of over 600 guests, following a vote among club managers.

The 21-year-old beat competition from Ipswich Town's Daryl Murphy and Watford's Troy Deeney to claim the overall Sky Bet Championship Player of the Year Award.

On winning the award, Bamford said: 'First and foremost I have to concentrate on these last few games and hope that Boro as a team go up and we can push into the Premier League. 

'After that I'm concentrating on the Euro's with England so, I think by the time I'm back from the Euro's I can sit down with Chelsea and see what's happening. There is a chance I could play against Boro but it's open ended and I won't find out till July. 

'Thanks to the club, my team mates because without them I wouldn't be here and of course the manager and my family.'
