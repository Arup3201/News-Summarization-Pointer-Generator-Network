If you fancy yourself as a modern-day Alan Turing, then this could be your chance to prove your code-breaking skills.

Developed by mathematicians at the University of Manchester, the quiz has been created to coincide with the launch of the film ‘The Imitation Game’.

Cryptic codes are hidden in the below images. When combined, they reveal the coordinates of buried treasure in the map.

The conundrum is based around a true story of how in 1940, Alan Turing converted his savings into silver ingots and buried them in Bletchley Park. 

In real life the silver has never been found, but for the purposes of the competition, a location has been chosen and three coded clues are there to be deciphered.

The film, starring Benedict Cumberbatch, tells the real-life story of mathematician Alan Turing, who is credited with cracking the German Enigma Code.

Solve this riddle to find a cryptic clue. This quiz was inspired by Alan Turing whose genius significantly shortened World War II

It portrays the nail-biting race against time by Turing and his team at Britain's top-secret code-breaking centre, Bletchley Park, during World War II.

Turing’s genius significantly shortened the war and saved thousands of lives, but his contribution was not recognised at the time.

In 1952, he was convicted of homosexual offences, and as an alternative to imprisonment accepted chemical castration with doses of the female hormone oestrogen. Among the consequences, he developed female breasts.

As well as a code breaker, Alan Turing was a pioneer of artificial intelligence and mathematical biology. During his time at Manchester University, Turing proposed a famous experiment now known as the Turing test

What do you have to do?

Decipher three coded clues and use them to find the location of the silver. Once you have the solution, submit your answers here.

Who is eligible?

Any resident of the United Kingdom can enter the competition, but only one prize will be awarded per household. A complete set of rules is given here.

What can you win?

The prizes will be film-related merchandise. Winners will be selected by a random draw from all correct solutions.

How long do you have?

The competition will close at midday on 28th November 2014. 

One day in 1954, aged only 41, he could bear his predicament no longer, and killed himself by eating an apple coated in cyanide. Last year, the Queen granted a posthumous pardon for the wartime hero.

As well as a code breaker, Turing was a pioneer of artificial intelligence and mathematical biology. 

During his time at Manchester University, Turing proposed a famous experiment now known as the Turing test.

This was his an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called `intelligent‘.

The idea was that a computer could be said to `think’ if it could fool an interrogator into believing that the conversation was with a human.

The quiz aims to highlight Turing’s achievements. Winners, who will be drawn at random from correct solutions, receive film-related merchandise.
