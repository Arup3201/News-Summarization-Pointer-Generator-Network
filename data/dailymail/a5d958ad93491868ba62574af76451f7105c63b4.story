Healthy pint: Beer is rich in calcium so could benefit your bones, and full or minerals and vitamins

Amid warnings that we should avoid soft drinks and fruit juice due to their high sugar content, some experts have suggested we drink only milk or water.

But another, rather unlikely low-sugar beverage is increasingly being hailed for its health benefits: beer.

Research suggests it can help protect against Alzheimer’s disease, aid weight loss and even balance hormones – and now it’s attracting more and more health-conscious men and women.

A raft of female celebrities are also embracing the brew.

Actress Mila Kunis says her favourite drink is Blue Moon beer, while supermodel Elle Macpherson revealed recently that she washes her hair with it.

Even saintly Hollywood star Gwyneth Paltrow has said she ‘can’t get enough of Guinness’.

So what are the benefits of beer, and can it really be good for you?

A VITAMIN-PACKED PINT

‘If you analysed beer you would  be amazed at how many super-nutrients there are in it,’ says Dr Stephan Domenig, medical director of The Original F.X. Mayr Health Centre in Austria. ‘Beer contains  all of the essential – and many of the non-essential – amino acids.’

As well as these protein-building blocks and minerals including phosphorus, iodine, magnesium and potassium, beer is rich in calcium  so could benefit your bones.

A study by Tufts University in the United States in 2009 found that moderate beer consumption can protect bone mineral density.

For years Guinness was even prescribed to pregnant women due to its high Vitamin B content. ‘It’s  now recommended that pregnant women avoid alcohol but other  people could benefit,’ says nutritionist Vicki Edgson.

Choose unpasteurised beer for the greatest health benefits. Pasteurising, or heating to prolong its shelf-life, reduces some nutritional value as the ‘living’ content is removed, says Georgina Young, head brewer at Fuller’s. And cloudy beer is best as filtering removes the yeast and therefore a lot of B vitamins.

BANISH THE BELLY

While
 high in vitamins, beer is actually low in sugar, high levels of which 
have been linked to diabetes and obesity.

While a can of Coke contains 
seven teaspoons and an orange juice six, half a pint of beer contains 
just over one.

‘Compared 
with soft drinks, it  will give less of a blood sugar  spike,’ says 
nutritionist Dr Kathryn O’Sullivan, who last year carried  out a 
scientific review of beer. ‘Beer is about 93 per cent water so it’s 
quite hydrating.’

In fact, 
moderate beer consumption may even help prevent diabetes. A 2010 study 
of more than 38,000 men in the US found that when men who rarely drank 
beer increased their consumption to one or two glasses a day, after four
 years their risk of type 2 diabetes fell by 25 per cent.

And despite 
the threat of a so-called ‘beer belly’, a study of nearly 2,000 regular 
beer drinkers by the University of London concluded it’s unlikely that 
moderate intake is associated with large weight gain.

‘Drinking beer increases the production of bile, which helps us to digest fatty food,’ says Dr Domenig. Beer is a rich source of fibre – two glasses provide between ten and  30 per cent of our recommended requirement. Fibre is known to help keep us full and ward off hunger.

STAVE OFF DISEASE

Although beer drinking is usually associated with brain fog, research suggests it might help prevent Alzheimer’s. The disease, which affects almost 500,000 people in the UK, has been linked to high levels  of aluminium, but the silicon in beer may offset the damage.

A 2008 study published in the journal Food And Chemical Toxicology found the silicon was able to reduce aluminium uptake in the digestive tract and slow the accumulation of the metal in the body and brain tissue. But beware of overdoing it:  a University College London study warned that men drinking more than two pints a day could suffer memory loss.

Beer could also help heart health. A 2013 study at Harokopio University in Athens found it boosted the flexibility of the arteries. Scientists measured the cardiovascular health of non-smoking men under 35 two hours after drinking 400ml of beer and compared that with drinking vodka or alcohol-free beer. While all three drinks had some beneficial effect on the stiffness of arteries, beer had the greatest benefit.

Beer can raise good cholesterol too. ‘The main component that helps protect the heart is alcohol, which raises “good” HDL-cholesterol and has other benefits,’ says Dr R. Curtis Ellison, professor of medicine and public health at the Boston University School of Medicine.

However, that’s not a licence to binge. ‘Large amounts of alcohol may cause disease of the heart muscle,’ warns Dr Ellison.

Not so bad: Moderate beer consumption may even help prevent diabetes and researchers have found that it is unlikely that moderate drinking is associated with large weight gain

BE BEER-TIFUL

While red wine is known for containing the anti-ageing plant compound resveratrol, beer drinkers also get skin-boosting benefits. Made from barley, beer is rich in ferulic acid, a potent antioxidant shown to protect skin from sun damage. This is also found in tomatoes, sweetcorn and rice bran, but research from Guy’s Hospital in London in 2000 suggests beer contains a more absorbable form. Men given low-alcohol beer absorbed all the ferulic acid present against just 25 per cent absorbed from tomatoes. Studies indicate that darker beers pack a stronger antioxidant punch.

Though it’s not just drinking  beer that health fans love. Catherine Zeta-Jones uses it as conditioner, saying: ‘I smell like the bottom of a beer barrel for days afterwards but it’s very good for the hair.’

‘The hops in beer contain silica which adds lustre, increases volume and fortifies the hair from within,’ says Janey Lee Grace, author of Look Great Naturally... Without Ditching The Lipstick.

To condition the hair using beer, she recommends first boiling the liquid to remove alcohol, which can strip hair of natural oils, then mixing it with extra virgin coconut oil.

BOOST YOUR LIBIDO

It may not be ‘beer goggles’ getting people in the mood – the hops in beer are said to have aphrodisiac-like qualities. ‘Hops are a wonderful relaxant,’ says Dr Marion Gluck,  an expert in hormonal imbalances. ‘And you don’t need much to get  the benefits,’ she adds. Research shows that the phytoestrogen from hops – oestrogen-like compounds found in plant foods – may help reduce hot flushes, low libido and other symptoms associated with menopause.

Beer may help balance hormones in cases of polycystic ovary syndrome, endometriosis and perimenopause, according to Vicki Edgson.

‘The phytoestrogens help to regulate either hormone deficiencies  or excess oestrogen,’ she says, advising that ‘half a pint once or twice a week would be ample to have an effect’. Edgson emphasises it does not work for everyone, though. ‘It should be tried in moderation initially to see whether symptoms are relieved.’
