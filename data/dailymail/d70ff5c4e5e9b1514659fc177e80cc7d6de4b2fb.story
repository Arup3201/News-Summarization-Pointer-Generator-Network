A man who was killed by a stranger he and his heavily-pregnant girlfriend met on Craigslist for sex was dead 'sometime' before his head was removed, authorities have revealed.

Charles Oppenneer, 25, was found decapitated in Gezon Park in Wyoming, Michigan on July 16 and a medical examiner has concluded he was mutilated after his death. His head still hasn't been found.

The following day, Oppenneer's eight-months-pregnant girlfriend, Brooke Slocum, 18, was found strangled to death in 31-year-old Brady Oestrike's car.

Authorities believe she had been held captive at Oestrike's home for days before she was killed and stashed in his car trunk. Her unborn daughter, Audi Lynn, also died.

Killed:
Brooke
 Slocum, who was eight months pregnant, and her boyfriend Charlie 
Oppenneer, 25, were both killed last week. Slocum was strangled while 
her boyfriend was decapitated. His head has not been found

Suspect: Slocum's body was found in the 
trunk of a car driven by killer Brady Oestrike (pictured). He led police
 on a high-speed chase on Thursday night before crashing the car and then shooting himself dead

The had couple vanished on July 12 and Oestrike, who police believe is responsible for both deaths, was eventually found last Thursday and fled as police tried to 
search his home.

He fatally shot himself after he crashed his car during
 a police chase.

Slocum's
 family are now preparing to say goodbye to the teen and her unborn baby
 with a visitation on Wednesday evening followed by a funeral on 
Thursday at the Saranac Community Church.

Investigators revealed last week that emails indicated Slocum had connected with their killer through a Craigslist ad and arranged a sexual encounter.

The plan was for Oppenneer to meet up with Oestrike and stay present as he had sex with his heavily pregnant girlfriend. Oestrike was then to pay the couple.

As the details emerged, the slain woman's father revealed that he knew about the couple's schemes and said that his daughter was desperate to do anything her boyfriend insisted so that they would stay together to bring up their child.

Greg Slocum said that his daughter was going to move in with her mother two weeks before her disappearance because she had broken up with Oppenneer - but instead, they got back together.

His daughter was desperate to get back with her child's father 'no matter what it took - and she paid the
 ultimate price for it', Slocum told WOOD-TV.

'Even to meet men on Craigslist to make 
some money because her boyfriend was manipulative,' he said. 'She would 
put herself through hell just to make sure her family didn't get 
divorced.'

He added that she had written letters to her unborn child about why she met men for sex, and explained that she simply wanted to be loved.

The devastated father said he had warned her against meeting strangers for sex but that she was a teenager with a mind of her own, WOOD-TV reported.

Police had
 been keeping watch at Oestrike's home on Thursday night, waiting on a 
warrant to search the house, when they saw him drive away at around 
9:15pm.

A SWAT team had been called in to aid in the search sine they suspected Oestrike had 'assault-style' weapons on the premises.

Oestrike then led police on a high-speed chase through the town.

At one point he briefly pulled over, but then fled again and eventually crashed his car near the entrance ramp for US-131.

When police went up to the car to make an arrest, they found Oestrike dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

They found Slocum's body in the back of the crashed car, just one day after her boyfriend was discovered murdered. 

Police have not announced a motive in the crime and the investigation is ongoing.
