School dinner ladies, as well as hundreds of carers and cleaners, have won an epic battle for equal pay.

Thousands of female workers could now win payouts after Sheffield city council agreed on an undisclosed out-of-court settlement with 900 women.

The individual payments are thought to range from around ‘a couple of hundred pounds to tens of thousands’, a union source has said.

If the council had gone to court and lost, they would have had to pay £20million in compensation. 

The settlement came after unions claimed that woman workers had been discriminated against by the council for years.

Female workers had also been excluded from a bonus scheme which employees in predominately male roles such as street cleaners and gardeners had received.

They also argued that their pay packet was far less than their male counterparts, in some cases by up to £10,000 per year.

Alan Hughes, from the union Unison, told the BBC: ‘They could have settled for probably half what it is going to cost them now.’

He added that he was ‘disappointed’ that is had taken three years for the council to finally settle.

One council care worker of 24 years, Diane Wragg, said: ‘This is great news. A lot of people will be really happy.

‘It was one of the first test cases to go to tribunal in 2005 and it is something that has been a very long time coming.

‘We stuck with this case because there were a lot of inequalities. Men were being paid more and getting bonuses.’

Sheffield Council’s director of human resources, Julie Toner, would not reveal the amount of compensation, but did confirm that a settlement had been agreed on.

‘The terms of the settlement are confidential so we will not be making further comment suffice to say we are content this has now been settled’, she said.

General secretary of Unison, Dave Prentis, told the Daily Mirror last night that 40,000 similar cases around the country had been awaiting the court hearing.

He said: ‘It makes sense the council has seen fit to pay women fairly.’

The council, which needs to save £220million in the next four years, says there will be no impact on finances due to the settlement and council taxpayers will not be affected.
