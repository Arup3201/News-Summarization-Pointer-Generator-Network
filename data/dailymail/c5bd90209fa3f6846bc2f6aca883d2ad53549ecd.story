Members of Congress, many of them military veterans who fought in Iraq, pummeled the Obama administration on Thursday for its 2011 troop withdrawal from the Middle Eastern country.

They argued that leaving a detachment of U.S. troops there would have prevented the al-Qaeda-related group ISIL, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, from steamrolling a murderous path from Mosul to towns near Baghdad.

On Wednesday the group took control of Tikrit, the hometown of former dictator Saddam Hussein.

ISIL militants have beheaded a crucified Iraqis who stand in the way of their push for a Shariah-compliant state that stretches across sections of Syria and northern Iraq.

'This is a desperate situation. It’s 
moving quickly,' Missouri Republican Sen. Roy Blunt said Thursday. He sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee.

'It appears to me that the chickens are coming home to 
roost for the president’s policy of not leaving anybody there to be a 
stabilizing force.'

Vietnam War veteran Sen. John McCain blasted Obama, saying he ignored America's national security needs in favor of political advantage when he pulled U.S. troops out of Iraq

House Foreign Affairs Committee chair Mike Rogers, a Republican congressman from Michigan, lashed out at the president for what he said was a lack of respect for blood spilled during nine years of war.

'Given past U.S. sacrifices,' he said, 'it's devastating to see terrorist groups taking over large cities in Iraq and marching to Baghdad – but not surprising.'

'The Obama Administration doesn’t seem much bothered by the chaos,' he said, 'which impacts U.S. national security interests.'

'When ISIS captured Fallujah earlier this year, that should have been a wake-up call.'

In January ISIL militants reclaimed Fallujah, a city west of Baghdad on the Euphrates River. U.S. forces captured it in 2004 in the bloodiest battle of the Iraq War.

More than 100 American lives were lost.

Following a classified intelligence briefing on Thursday, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters that the terrorists overrunning Iraq 'have as part of their agenda to attack out homeland. The next 9/11 is in the making.'

The briefing, he said, 'scared the hell out of me. The worst is yet to come.'

Some military officials have told The Wall Street Journal that ISIL is 
now the single biggest terror threat facing the U.S.

'It makes you want 
to kill yourself,' one senior U.S. official said of American intelligence on 
the group that he saw during a May meeting
 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.

Thursday's rhetorical high point, after President Obama assured Americans that he wouldn't 'rule out anything' from his palette of military options, came when Arizona Sen. John McCain took to the Senate floor to blast the president.

Just 'because the president of 
the United States declares that a conflict is over,' he said, it 'does not mean, in the
 eyes of the enemy, that it's over.'

'Could all this have been avoided?' he asked, after reading a three-minute-long description of Iraq's devastation at ISIL's hands. 'The answer is absolutely yes.'

'If I sound angry it's because I am angry.'

Obama's pullout, he said, 'was driven by politics and not by our national security interests.'

'I believe that history will judge the president’s 
leadership with the scorn and disdain that it deserves,' he concluded,' tossing papers onto a tabletop with disgust.

Should they have stayed? U.S. soldiers were in Iraq until December 2011, when President Obama triumphantly withdrew them and declared that the war was over

'I don't rule anything out': President Barack Obama announced Thursday that military options against Iraqi insurgents were on the table, but Republicans won't give him credit for cleaning up his own mess

McCain tied Iraq's return to civil-war footing to Obama's decision to withdraw U.S> troops from Afghanistan by the time he leaves office.

'The Iraq war did not end because the forces against Iraq and within 
Iraq were still undefeated,' he boomed. 'The conflict in Afghanistan will not be over
 two years from now, in 2017, when the final American is scheduled to 
leave Afghanistan.'

Ultimately, said McCain, 'it's time the president got a new security team that knows what it is to succeed in conflict.'

Senate Armed Services Committee chair Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, insisted that senators 'shouldn’t knee jerk anything.'

He blamed Baghdad, not the Obama White House, for the failure to ink a bilateral security agreement that could have kept U.S. troops in Iraq past 2011.

'The Iraqi government – a few years back, when they had a chance to sign an agreement that would keep some of our presence there, refused to do it,' Levin said.

'So we’ve got to be very careful and thoughtful before we do anything.'

The proposed 2012-and-beyond agreement was never finalized – partly because Iraq resisted giving American personnel immunity from Iraqi
 law, and partly because the Obama administration chose to withdraw 
instead of pressing the issue.

Georgia Republican Sen. Saxby Chambliss, vice-chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, ricocheted an Obama 2012 campaign slogan back in the direction of the Oval Office.

'I hope this is a wakeup call for anyone who thinks al-Qaeda or Islamic extremists are "on the run",' he said.

ISIL was known as 'Al-Qaeda in Iraq' until early in 2014.

Three of the 17 members of Congress who fought in Iraq told National Journal on Thursday that the post-withdrawal resurgence of an Al-Qaeda splinter group there cheapened the value of their service.

'Going
 out across the desert I remember the feelings that you have, wondering 
if you're going to make it out alive, said Pennsylvania Republican Rep. 
Scott Perry.

'Right now I wonder what that was all about. What was the point of all of that?'

Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia pointed a finger directly at President Obama.

'I think at this point the administration made a choice to cut and run, Collins told National Journal.

'When Fallujah fell again, we knew this foreign policy had consequences.'

Ohio Rep. Brad Wenstrup said maintaining close ties with Iraq, instead of leaving only an embassy contingent there at the end of 2011, would have brought the U.S. 'another ally in the region.'

'I came home from Iraq feeling that we liberated 25 million people,' he said.

But now the task falls to Iraqi citizens themselves to hold back ISIL from taking Baghdad, and with it the rest of the country.

The Obama administration has sent the Iraqi army everything from rifles to rockets, but much of that materiel is falling into ISIL's hands as soldiers flee battlefields.

'It seems to me that the Iraqis laid down a lot of the arms that we gave to them,' Wenstrup mused.

'So that doesn't seem to be the solution.'

Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger told CNN on Thursday that Obama would be responsible for whatever happens in Iraq.

'Let's be clear,' he said. 'The full withdraw in 2011 was a big mistake. We would not be facing this situation.'

'Are airstrikes are going to be the panacea? I don't know, but we're seeing what happens when nothing occurs: You're going to have Baghdad, almost the size of Chicago, in flames.'
