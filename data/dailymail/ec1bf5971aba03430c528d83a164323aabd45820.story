After a 2-1 north London derby day victory against Arsenal on Saturday, Tottenham fans are understandably starting to imagine their team finishing inside the Premier League's top four.

With a Premier League clash against Liverpool to come on Tuesday night, those same fans will be hoping that Spurs can lay down a marker at Anfield that suggests their team are serious contenders for fourth spot.

However, Tottenham's next opponents have become somewhat of a bogey team, with Liverpool winning the last three Premier League meetings and racking up an 12-0 aggregate scoreline.

Liverpool have become a bogey team for Totteham and beat them 3-0 at White Hart Lane last summer

The biggest aggregate scorelines between current Premier League teams after their last three meetings... 

Man City vs Spurs: 15-2

Liverpool vs Spurs: 12-0

Southampton vs Newcastle: 10-1

Arsenal vs Aston Villa: 10-1

Southampton vs Sunderland: 11-3 (though 2 have been draws)

Chelsea vs Swansea: 10-2

Brendan Rodgers' side have enjoyed 5-0, 4-0, and 3-0 victories against the north London club in the last 16 months, but Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino will no doubt believe his side have a chance to overturn those fortunes with his side and star striker Harry Kane looking in brilliant form.

Tottenham's first of three heavy beatings against the Reds came in December, 2013 and saw Luis Suarez begin the rout before goals from Jordan Henderson, Jo Flanagan and Raheem Sterling completed a memorable day for Liverpool at White Hart Lane. 

Liverpool, who were on the hunt for a first Premier League title in over 20 years, moved to the top of the table after the 4-0 drubbing of Spurs in March as an early own goal from Younes Kaboul sparked another strike from the rampant Suarez leaving Philippe Coutinho and Henderson to do the rest.

Spurs then suffered their first loss under Pochettino with a 3-0 defeat at White Hart Lane as Sterling, Steven Gerrard and Alberto Moreno compounded the home side's misery in August, 2014.

Tuesday night, however, finds Spurs in better form and a better mood coming off the back of Harry Kane's double against Arsenal on Saturday which put the Lily Whites into fifth place in the Premier League, just one point behind Manchester United.  

Kane, who now has 22 goals to his name this season, is expected to lead the line once again as his side look to end their modern day hoodoo against the Merseyside outfit. 

Although Tottenham won't be particularly proud of their recent record against Liverpool, it is not their worst in the current top flight.

Pochettino's side also have a poor record against Premier League champions Manchester City, with the former scoring just twice and conceding 15 goals in their last three meetings.

Other undesirable records includ Newcastle's 10-1 aggregate scoreline against Southampton while Arsenal's recent 5-0 win against Aston Villa also gives Paul Lambert's side a 10-1 deficit when adding together the last three games.   

After a run of fixtures that has seen Spurs collect nine points from their last three Premier League games and Liverpool winning three of their last four before being haulted by Everton, Tuesday night's game looks finely balanced.

Spurs will be hoping that by ending their recent hoodoo against Liverpool, they will also be announcing themselves as major contenders for a top four spot come the end of the season.
