It's hard enough to persuade young children to eat healthily but for Nicola Davies that campaign became a lot more difficult after opening a tin of sweetcorn to discover an inch-long caterpillar inside.

Ms Davies, from Tamworth, Staffordshire, was preparing a healthy dinner for her two children Reece and Hollie, aged eight and five, when she opened a tin of Aldi sweetcorn and made a grisly discovery.

She said: 'At first I thought it was a husk from the corn, but I picked it up and saw it had eyes. I screamed and threw it down.

Nicola Davies said she screamed and threw the tin down after finding the dead bug

'I was going to give it to my kids to eat.

'I would understand if it was in a normal lettuce, but not in a tin can. It's disgusting.'

The caterpillar measures just under an inch long.

Ms Davies said she bought the can of Sweet Harvest sweetcorn from a branch of Aldi in her hometown two weeks ago, but only opened it on Tuesday.

She tried to report the discovery to the store manager soon after but said nobody at the bargain retailer responded to her complaint.

'I'm really annoyed that they have not yet got back to me,' she added. 'Something of that nature they should be back in touch straight away.

'I was told I could not speak to a manager and 'I was annoyed because I felt they weren't taking the matter seriously.

'It was not that I found the product inferior, it was the fact I had found something dead in it.'

An Aldi spokesman said: 'We have strict quality control measures in place and take any complaints about the quality of our products very seriously.

'We have asked Mrs Davies to return this product so we can carry out a full investigation into what may have happened.

'We can confirm we have had no other complaints of this nature.'

This caterpillar is not the first unwelcome passenger to have almost made it to the dinner plate.

In 2010 mother Alison Mugford received Â£20 compensation from Tesco after finding a wasp embedded in a Jaffa Cake her two-year-old son Hayden was eating.

The same year an unnamed shopper opened a bag of lettice bought from Tesco in Lewes to discover a live Egyptian giant grasshopper inside.

Even ready meals bought from posh retailer M&S have been found to have extra ingredients, in 2011 Jemma Cohen and Christyanna Mendel began eating a roasted vegetable and pesto pizza only to discover a whole cockroach among the toppings.

And in 2013 Jenna Murray bought a Â£3 smoked mackerel, beetroot and new potato ready meal from an M&S branch in Camden, north London, which contained a whole dead beetle.
