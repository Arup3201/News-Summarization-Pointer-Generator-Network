Harry Redknapp has backed Malky Mackay to make a return to football, insisting: ‘He's not a rapist he's not a paedophile. He's made a mistake and it shouldn't end his football career.' 

Sportsmail revealed this week that Mackay had exchanged a series of racist, sexist and homophobic text messages with Iain Moody while they were at the Welsh club.

But Redknapp believes the Scot should be given the chance to redeem himself.

He said: ‘Malky Mackay has made a big mistake, him and the other lad. What they did is not right but Malky Mackay is a great fella, a family man, a football man but he's made mistakes.

‘Suddenly everybody's an angel. It shouldn't finish his life he's a top manager and I feel really sorry for him.

‘I'm not condoning what he's done but he's not a bad person, he's a fantastic lad. Show me somebody who's never made a mistake and I’ll show you a liar.

‘He's not a rapist, he's not a paedophile. He's made a mistake and it shouldn't end his football career.

‘I'm lucky I don’t send text messages but I do get silly message with sick jokes on them from time to time.’

Mackay was set to be named as the new Crystal Palace manager before he dropped out of the running after the club learned of the evidence that was passed to the FA.

Moody, meanwhile, resigned from his position as Palace’s sporting director.

On Thursday, the League Managers Association issued a poorly-worded statement on behalf of Mackay - before a backlash forced them into a humbling apology.

The original statement read: ‘In the course of a search by the club in early 2014 of 10,000 private text messages sent to and from another member of staff, it emerged that Malky had, it seems, sent a couple of one-line texts that were, with the benefit of hindsight, very regrettable and disrespectful of other cultures.

‘These were two text messages sent in private at a time Malky felt under great pressure and when he was letting off steam to a friend during some friendly text message banter.’

But less than 24 hours later, a second statement was released: 'The LMA apologises for some of its wording, in its release yesterday, which was inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist, sexist or homophobic nature. That was certainly not our intention.

The LMA apologises for some of its wording, in its release yesterday, which was inappropriate and has been perceived to trivialise matters of a racist, sexist or homophobic nature. That was certainly not our intention.

'It is beyond argument that any comments that are discriminatory, even used in private, are totally unacceptable. The LMA remains absolutely aware of our responsibility to the game and to promote and uphold the highest standards of behaviour.

'The LMA will not be commenting further on the allegations relating to Malky Mackay whilst The FA conducts its investigation, other than to repeat that both the LMA and Malky will be cooperating fully.

'We will continue to work with all of the game's stakeholders to address the important issues of respect and discriminatory behaviour in all its forms.'
