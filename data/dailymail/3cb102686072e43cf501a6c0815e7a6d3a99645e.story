A navy SEAL who was shot 27 times by Al Qaeda has shared the story of his miraculous survival as he fought to defeat four terrorists and get back home to his wife and daughters.

Mike Day was serving  in Iraq’s Anbar Province in April 2007 when he came face-to-face with four heavily armed Al Qaeda leaders inside a 12 x 12 foot room while searching for a high-level terrorist cell.

Despite being shot 27 times at close range, Day was able to fight off the men, clear the rest of the house and walk under his own power to a medevac helicopter.

Mike Day was serving in Iraq’s Anbar Province in April 2007 when he came face-to-face with four heavily armed Al Qaeda leaders inside a 12 x 12 foot room while searching for a high-level terrorist cell

He told Fox News that he opened the door on the night of April 6 and the terrorists beat him to the trigger, shooting his rifle out of his hands and hitting him 16 times in the arms, legs and abdomen. 

The remaining eleven shots hit his body armour, which amazingly absorbed multiple strikes despite not being designed to withstand that level of force.

After the first round, the body armour he was wearing is expected to deteriorate and fall apart.

'Anywhere you can put your finger on me, I was shot, except for my head,' he said. 'And here I am today, to tell the story.

'I was there, and I don't believe it.'

He said that once he realized he was actually being shot, he 'asked God to get me home to my girls,' which he noted was the first time he had ever said a real prayer.

The navy SEAL then used his pistol and muscle memory to  fight his way out of the room.

He said: 'I just did what I was trained to do.' 

The navy SEAL plans to compete in the Ironman 70.3 triathlon in Florida to raise funds for the care and treatment of wounded warriors and dependent children who have suffered severe brain injuries

Day revealed that another navy SEAL died that night from just a single gunshot wound.

After spending two years recovering in hospital, Day is devoting himself to raising funds for the Brain Treatment Center through Mike Day's Tri Challenge.

He will compete in the Ironman 70.3 triathlon in Florida to raise funds for the care and treatment of wounded warriors and dependent children who have suffered severe brain injuries.

The funds will provide customized treatment programs to individuals at the Carrick Brain Treatment Center, a non-profit organization in Texas.

He has already raised more than $33,000 on his CrowdRise page but hopes that the figure will rise to at least $75,000.

'My life's mission now not about me,' Day added. 'Rather, it is to care for and lead my wounded brothers and sisters. My fellow warriors deserve the best available treatment for their injuries.'
