There is nothing more disappointing than a soggy salad when it comes to summertime lunching.

But such unsatisfactory snacks could become a thing of the past as scientists have found a way to genetically extending the life of lettuce so leaves will stay fresh for more than a week.

By looking at the lettuce’s genetic make-up they are breeding selectively ‘tougher’ plants.

No more soggy salad! Scientists have developed a way to genetically extend the life of lettuce so it stays crispy for up to eight days

Researchers from the University of Southampton found that smaller leaves with lots of cells packed closely together remain green, crisp and firm for longer.

Having made the observation, Gail Taylor, a professor in plant biology at the university worked out which genes are responsible for these characteristics.

She is now working with Vitacress - one of the biggest producers of packaged salads - to selectively breed lettuces with these qualities.

It means the leaves, which often wilt and turn brown after just a few days, will last at home for up to eight days.

‘People will know how frustrating it is to buy a bag of prepared salad only for it to wilt and turn into a brown mush after a few days. If you don’t eat it quickly enough you end up being wasteful and throwing it away,’ Professor Taylor said.

‘Our research means growers will soon be supplying supermarkets with leaves that will last more than a week after you get them home.

‘That will allow families to do their weekly food shop and have a fresh salad on any day of the week.

‘Our findings are also applicable to spinach and rocket leaves, which often come in the mixed leaf bags. However, they already tend to be more hardy.’

Baby salad leaves, which are usually cos or lollo rossa, undergo rigorous processing – which includes harvesting, transportation, washing, sanitisation, removal of excess water, and packaging - before they reach supermarket shelves.

Only the most robust leaves can survive this process without being bruised and damaged, which makes growing salad crops with ‘processable’ leaves extremely important for the packaged salad industry, as it reduces waste and increases shelf life.

Professor Taylor found producers could also increase the shelf-life of salad by reducing the water used during growing by 20 per cent, which has the added benefit of being more environmentally friendly.

‘We were able to show if you reduce water use in intensive salad production by about 20 per cent, you actually develop smaller, tougher leaves with stiff cells walls, which is what we’re interested in,’ she said.

She said that the researchers have used fundamental biological knowledge and applied it through genetics and crop production techniques to help Vitacress improve the quality of its products.

Professor Taylor said there is a trade-off between taste, crispiness, and shelf-life ‘because you want the leaves to be firm but not too hard.’

Dr Steve Rothwell, from Vitacress, said: ‘The results open the door to exciting further studies across a wider range of crops and geographies to drive down the use of water while improving crop quality and shelf life.’
