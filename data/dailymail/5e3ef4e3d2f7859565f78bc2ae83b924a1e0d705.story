If your lavender bushes seem to be bereft of bees, then you might need to be a little more selective in your choice of plant.

For a study has found that English lavender is twice as good at attracting bumblebees as French lavender.

Its simple clusters of flowers are more accessible to bees than the ornamental frills on the French, according to scientists from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.

In the Big Bumblebee Discovery survey carried out by 30,000 schoolchildren, the insects were spotted twice every five minutes on English lavender, where they feed on nectar.

French lavender – characterised by frilly ‘rabbit ear’ petals that point upwards – saw bumblebees visit only once every five minutes.

The study – one of a growing number of ‘citizen science’ experiments used to track wildlife – also found a surprising number of bumblebees in city centres, until now were thought to be desolate areas for pollinating insects.

In fact, the participants recorded more bees on lavender in urban areas than in suburban or rural locations.

The ecologists, presenting their results yesterday (MON) at the British Science Festival in Birmingham, said lavender creates an ‘oasis’ of nectar for bumblebees.

Dr Michael Pocock, of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Wallingford, Oxfordshire, said: ‘What is commonly called French lavender tends to be a much more ornamental plant.

‘English lavender tended to be visited at a much higher rate.

‘The names used do not mean that one is from England and the other is from France – they are both plants that were introduced to Britain in the past.’

English lavender, which is more commonly planted in this country, copes better with cold and wet weather than French lavender, which is widely grown on the continent for its oil.

Dr Helen Roy, also of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, added: ‘Our understanding is that on more fancy flowers it is more tricky for the bumblebees to access the nectar.’

The scientists said they had been puzzled when participants had recorded more bees in city centre locations than in other areas.

But they said the trend might be explained by the fact insects in urban areas are simply more reliant on lavender – the only species of plant that was monitored.

Dr Pocock said: ‘We were surprised to see more observations in urban localities, as suburban gardens are often thought to be better.

‘Planting lavender - and other flowers - in city areas could help to support populations of pollinators in those habitats.’

A quarter of the bumblebees in Europe are at risk of extinction as their habitats are destroyed, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Loss of wildflower meadows and the use of pesticides such as neonicotinoids are largely blamed for their decline.

Bumblebees are vital to agriculture as they pollinate fruit and vegetables - a natural phenomenon thought to be worth £560million a year to the British economy.

The survey involved 30,000 children, who recorded 27,000 individual bumblebees at 4,000 sites. Dr Roy said: ‘The number of people who have taken part in the Big Bumblebee Discovery is inspiring and their observations are extremely insightful. ‘Understanding the experiences of citizen scientists is extremely useful for the development of future projects where mass participation can aid the scientific process.’
