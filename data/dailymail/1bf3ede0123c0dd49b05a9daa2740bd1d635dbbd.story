England's Steve Way finished 10th in the men's Commonwealth Games marathon and set a new personal best with a time of 2hrs 15mins 16secs.

He also beat Ron Hill’s 1979 British record 
of 2hours 15mins 46secs, for runners aged 40 or over.

It has been a quite extraordinary 
turnaround for a ‘fat bloke’ who decided to run the 2006 London Marathon
 ‘on a whim’ and ended up beating many younger, thinner, fitter club 
runners by clocking 3hrs 7mins 8secs.

Personal best: Steve Way completed a remarkable turnaround by finishing 10th in the marathon

Pleased: Steve Way tweeted shortly after the race describing it as the 'Best day ever'

Going the distance: Steve Way will represent England in the marathon at the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow

The 40-year-old has changed his life completely in the last seven years, going from a man that had high blood pressure, smoked 20 cigarettes a day and weighed 16-and-a-half-stone, to one of the best marathon runners in the Commonwealth.

Other notable British
 finishers include Nicholas Torry (England, 13th), Ben Moreau (England, 
14th), Ross Houston (Scotland, 16th) and Andrew Davies (Wales, 17th).

The race was won by Australian Michael Shelley, who finished second in the marathon at the Delhi Games in 2010.

Way, who now weighs just 10st 8lbs, was the third British man home in this year’s London Marathon, crossing the line in 15th place, just eight minutes behind Mo Farah, to earn his place at these Games.

Turnaround: Steve Way was overweight and unhealthy before he changed his life through running

He now runs around 130 miles a week — averaging 11 miles a day for the past seven years — and believes he could win gold in the 100km (62-mile) World Championships in Doha in November if he can clock under 6hrs 20mins.

He is a self-confessed ‘running nerd’ but still struggles to define himself as an elite athlete. There is clearly still disbelief that he found himself posing for pictures with Sir Bradley Wiggins in the athletes’ village in Glasgow and ‘casually ‘‘hanging out’’ with the guys I’m normally watching on the Diamond League circuit — even though I’m old enough to be most of their dads!’.
