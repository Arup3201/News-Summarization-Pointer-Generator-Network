Swansea City have signed France international striker Baf√©timbi Gomis but face the prospect of losing Michu this summer.

The 28-year-old has been linked with Premier League rivals West Ham, Sunderland, Newcastle and QPR, as well as Turkish giants Galatasaray, but underwent a
 medical on Tuesday after agreeing terms with the Swans.

Goal scorer: The frontman has averaged about 20 goals a season for Lyon in Ligue 1

Coup: Swansea have fought off competition from Premier League rivals for Gomis

He was a free 
agent after leaving Lyon, has averaged around 20 goals a season over the
 past two years and was a target for Swansea last summer.

Those
 goals will be all the more vital should Michu depart.

The Spaniard, 28, is wanted by Napoli and Atletico Madrid while Michael Laudrup's new 
club Lekhwiya are also keen.

In demand: Michu could leave the Liberty Stadium this summer
