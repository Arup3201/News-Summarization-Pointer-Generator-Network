Authorities in Pennsylvania had identified the two young sisters who died in a freak accident after a falling tree landed on their moving car on Monday.

Eight-year-old Ryleigh Freiwald and six-year-old Macayla Freiwald perished when the car driven by Jason Hinebaugh, 36, was crushed by the tree and careered out of control hitting a utility pole around 2.30pm.

Investigators said that two young girls died of blunt force trauma to the head and witnesses to the harrowing crash recounted how their eight-month pregnant mother, Ashley Lichty, 26, burst out of the passenger side of the car after the accident screaming, 'My babies, my babies.'

Both Lichty and Hinebaugh are now in intensive care at Conemaugh Memoiral Medical Center where the girls two younger sisters, Ciara Freiwald, 5, and Lillie Freiwald, 3, are being treated for less severe injuries.

Lichty, who is eight months pregnant, has not lost her child, according to Conemaugh Township Police chief Louis Barclay.

'She got out of the vehicle,' he said to WPXI. 'The driver was unconscious behind the wheel.'

Paramedic Adma Trabold of Conemaugh Township EMS descrived the harrowing scene in the aftermath of the accident.

'After I arrived on the scene, it was uncontrolled chaos,' Trabold said.

'We were trying to get everything done. Once you get more resources, you're able to focus on one patient at a time. I tried to treat each patient as my family member.'

Terry Ruparcic, who manages the EMS station said the accident was a '9 out of 10' on the scale of traumatic accidents he has seen.

The paramedics were given the opportunity to talk to mental health counselors after the accident.

Hinebaugh has been dating Lichty for about 18 months and is about eight months pregnant with his child, said a friend to WPXI.

Devastating: This is the wreckage of the family car that led to the deaths of two of the four children in the backseat

Police say the male driver, a pregnant woman and the other two children were injured and taken to Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center.

Witness Sandy Seth lives along the street from the accident and heard the crash happen in the middle of Monday afternoon.

'This was pure mother nature at its worst,' said Sandy to WTAJ.

'I saw a lady get out of the passenger seat screaming, 'My babies, my babies'.

'We heard the thump, we didn't come out right away.

'We watched the emergency services cut the doors off and cut the roof off and get the driver out of the car.

'I am glad we didn't come out when we first heard the thump otherwise we wouldn't have been able to sleep for days.'

Severe: The four surviving members of the family were taken to hospital after the accident

Erosion: This is the stump of the tree that authorities believe had rotted away before the accident on Monday

Chief Louis Barclay of the Conemaugh Township Police said heâ€™s shocked at the freak nature of the accident.

'In my 23-years here I have never had anything like this,' said Chief Louis Barclay.

'To have two young children die in the same family it must be horrendous on the parents, I can't even imagine.'

Authorities said the tree was rotten at the base but they don't know what caused the tree to fall.
