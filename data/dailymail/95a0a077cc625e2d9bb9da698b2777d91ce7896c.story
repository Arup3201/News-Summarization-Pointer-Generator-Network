Two divers have died after getting into trouble in the English Channel.

The men, aged in their 40s, were diving off Eastbourne this afternoon, Sussex Police said.

The coastguard was called at around 1.30pm following a mayday call from the dive boat.

Two divers died after getting in to difficulty in the English Channel. Their boat was stationed several miles off the coast of Eastbourne, pictured, when they got in to trouble, police confirmed

Some reports have suggested the two may have fallen unwell with the Bends - the decompression sickness that can effect divers as they rise to the surface.

A Coastguard Rescue Helicopter and the Trinity House vessel 'Patricia' sped to the scene.

The two victims were hoisted aboard the helicopter after a rescue bid in the water, which involved the crew from their own boat and the Trinity House launch.

They were taken to Eastbourne District General Hospital where they later died, police have now confirmed.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Ling said: 'Tragically two divers have died after getting into difficulty while diving in the Channel.

'We are informing their families and will be conducting an investigation into the circumstances.'

A spokesman for the Coastguard said: 'Dover Coastguard has been assisting a dive boat this afternoon after two of its divers experienced difficulties during a dive mid channel, south of Eastbourne.

The two divers were airlifted to Eastbourne District General Hospital by Coastguard rescuers. The men, in their 40s, are yet to be named

'Both divers have been evacuated from the dive vessel by Coastguard helicopter, with the assistance of the Trinity House Vessel, 'Patricia' and have been taken to Eastbourne Hospital.'

A Dover Coastguard spokesman told MailOnline: ‘We got a mayday call from the dive boat. We responded and sent a helicopter which picked up two unconscious divers and took them to Eastbourne.

‘The alarm was raised by the vessel. There were 10 people diving on board, and the dive master on the boat as well.’

The divers are yet to be named.

It is thought attempts were being made this afternoon to contact people connected with the dive boat.

Police were unwilling to give details of the boat from which they were diving.
