The RSPCA has called for a 'sick' dog fighting mobile phone app which allows players to re-enact the brutal bloodsport to be banned.

KG Dogfighting is a mini-game available on Android phones which challenges users to train up killer dogs which they can use to fight other players' dogs in bloody online death-matches.

Seattle-based developer Kage Games, which is responsible for the game, say the app does not violate Google terms of use, claiming it is no more dangerous than the popular Angry Birds app.

Controversial: The RSPCA has called for KG Dog Fighting to be banned. The mini game available for Android phones allows players to 
re-enact the brutal bloodsport of dog fighting

Dangerous: Dog fighting is banned in both the UK and U.S

But the RSPCA has condemned the 
software as 'irresponsible and inappropriate', before urging Google to 
withdraw it from their popular Andriod mobile service.

Dog fighting is banned in both the UK and U.S.

An RSPCA spokesman said: 'Having looked at the details of this game we believe it is entirely irresponsible and inappropriate.

'We would hope the makers would consider withdrawing this game and urge anyone who objects to it to contact the games company to express their disappointment about its launch.

'At best this could result in animal 
abuse being seen as acceptable and at worst result in even more dogs 
suffering pain and distress.

'The makers of the game might like to visit one of our rescue centres and see some of the many dogs which have been abused.

'A
lot of those we house have suffered appalling injury and neglect at the
hands of uncaring and thoughtless people involved in dog fighting.'

The high profile criticism adds to 
comments left on the software company’s website by outraged gamers who 
blast the app as 'sick, immature, twisted and foolish.'

Despite its availability for download
to kids as young as 13 for a mere £3.10, Kage Games insist the app does
not breach 'high maturity' Android guidelines.

In
a preview for the product on their site, KG Games say: 'Just because 
something is illegal in real life in certain countries does not mean it 
is illegal to make a song, movie, or video game about it.'

Referencing Angry Birds in their 
defence, a product description points out: 'Just go slingshot some 
virtual birds to kill some virtual pigs.'

Then poking fun at those outraged by the bloody content of the app KG Games suggest critics can tell 'someone who cares'.

On their website, a spokesperson for KG Games said: 'We do not condone violence towards animals or humans, and we are confident in humankind’s ability to distinguish between a rudimentary game and the consequences of real life.

'We are confident this game will be a 
net benefit to dogs as it has been in our operating agreement from the 
start of this project that a portion of the proceeds go to animal rescue
organisations.'

The Dog’s Trust, which looks after abandoned and traumatised dogs, also weighed into the argument demanding Google remove the game from its site.

A spokesperson for the Dog’s Trust said: 'We are totally opposed to any form of organised dog fighting and its promotion.

'We are appalled to see this despicable and illegal practice being touted in virtual form as entertainment regardless of any age restrictions applied.'

Android has defended its decision to allow the new version of the controversial app to appear on the UK versions of the Android store.

A spokesperson for Android in the UK said: 'The Android Market takedown team and the Legal team have both reviewed the app and decided it was not in violation of any Android Market policies.

'Google do not have any further comment on the matter.'

THOSE WHO LOVED IT

'As an animal lover I was initially
horrified by it, but you made your points so compellingly that I almost
bought it just to support you and the causes to which you contribute.'

'I disagree with the content in this
game but as a game fan I say keep the game up! While I disagree with 
the content don't let them bully you into taking it down'

'Honestly, I feel dog fighting to 
be despicable, an unforgivable crime. That being said, I believe in free
speech and freedom of expression. Gaming is a fantasy, a break from 
reality, and should be treated as such no matter the content.'

... AND THOSE WHO HATED IT

'Anyone that would play this "game" would do the same thing to real dogs. Anyone with a heart would be appalled by this!'

'For everyone that supposedly buys your little game just remember the rest of us and the unbelievable amount of heart we have when it comes to protecting our animals and what we will be saying about your game, your company, and everything that promotes it'.

'Moral aspects of dogfighting aside, the game sucks'
