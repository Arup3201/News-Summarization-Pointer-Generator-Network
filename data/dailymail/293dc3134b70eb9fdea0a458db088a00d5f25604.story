A Massachusetts Institute of Technology health economist who made national headlines last year for talking about 'the stupidity of the American voter' was a target Monday in a report from the Vermont state auditor saying the economist may have padded his bills to the state.

Auditor of Accounts Douglas Hoffer said he referred his findings on Jonathan Gruber and his contract with the state to Attorney General William Sorrell. 

Hoffer said Gruber's invoices billed Vermont $100 per hour for the work of a research assistant – 1,000 hours in 10 weeks.

'To do so, the RA would have worked exclusively on this project for more than 14 hours per day – every day,' the auditor said.

If the assistant worked Monday through Friday, it would amount to 20 hours per day, with just four hours left over to eat and sleep. 

MIT professor Jonathan Gruber helped draft the Affordable Care Act and had the ear of every Democrat in Washington before it emerged that he had credited 'the stupidity of the American voter' for the law's passage

'The evidence suggests that Dr. Gruber overstated the hours worked by the RA and that the Agency of Administration ignored the obvious signs that something was amiss.'

The attorney general said in an interview that Hoffer raised 'serious questions.'

Gruber said in an email Monday to the Associated Press that he did not wish to comment.

The MIT economist got $392,600 from the Department of Health and Human Services for his Obamacare consulting, records show.

The National Institutes of Health paid him another $2 million for Medicare consulting, and the Justice Department has compensated him to the tune of $1.7 million for 'expert witness testimony.'

Four US states, including Vermont, contracted with him for another $1.6 million in consuting work for advice about health care laws. 

An adviser to the Obama administration on the federal Affordable Care Act, Gruber told groups in 2012 and 2013 that voter stupidity and a 'lack of transparency' were important to passing the hard-fought legislation. He has apologized repeatedly for his comments, saying they were uninformed, 'glib, thoughtless and sometimes downright insulting.'

Vermont Administration Secretary Justin Johnson said Monday the two state officials working with Gruber, Robin Lunge and Michael Costa, were in contact with him frequently enough – sometimes multiple times a day – to monitor his work.

Still, Johnson said he is urging staff to step up contract vigilance, and he agreed with Hoffer's criticism that Gruber's invoices need more detail. He said state officials had assumed Gruber had multiple assistants working with him, but later learned there was just one.

'We feel that the work was done, but clearly it would have been better if we had documented that and they had documented that,' Johnson said.

Hoffer said the round numbers in Gruber's invoices were a red flag.

RED FLAGS: Billing for a research assistant to work 1,000 hours over 10 weeks – an exact number that seemed unrealistic and also 'rounded' – got Gruber in trouble

'It is noteworthy that Dr. Gruber's first invoice reported round numbers of hours worked (100 for Mr. Gruber and 500 for the research assistants),' Hoffer wrote. 

'This is possible, but unlikely. In addition, the second invoice reported exactly the same figures, which is implausible.'

Vermont contracted with Gruber in July to do economic modeling for Green Mountain Care, a universal, publicly-funded health care system that had been in development since the Legislature passed and Gov. Peter Shumlin signed a bill in 2011 to create the system.

Shumlin ended up pulling the plug on Green Mountain Care in December, saying it would be too expensive.

Johnson said the state has paid $160,000 to date on what initially was a $450,000 contract, including $50,000 for a subcontractor.

He billed the state for 1,000 hours of work by a research assistant over just 10 weeks – a rate of more than 20 hours for every weekday
