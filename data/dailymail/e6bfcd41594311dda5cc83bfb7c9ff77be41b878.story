A group of zombies piling out of a stone building before being bloodily shot down is not the kind of footage regularly used to coerce home buyers into spending millions on a new family home.

But as the real estate agents at Harcourts in Queensland hope to point out, the Rumble Castle is not your average property.

Slowly built-up and perfected on four hectares of land for over 30 years, each section of the property at Waterford Queensland, was independently designed and hand crafted by local builder Brian Rumble.

Harcourts real estate agents have put together an eccentric marketing campaign for the property at 54 Gardiner Road Waterford in Queensland

Independently designed and handcrafted over 30 years by local builder Brian Rumble, the home built as a real-life castle complete with battlements

Complete with stain glass windows, hand carved gargoyles, Gothic arches and curves and sweeping corridors with high ceilings and cobwebs-to-boot, the haunting fortress stands out from any other property, Harcourts agent Julie Andrews told Daily Mail Australia.

'Stone, slate, timber, clay carvings, led light glass timber, sweeping staircases and a hatch that you can turn which opens and lets you walk right through until you're at the top of a battlement torrent and you can see right up above the mountain ranges and beyond,' Ms Andrews said as she described the magnificent building.

'There's no comparison out there for this type of property,' she said, adding that no expected price for the house has been made public.

She described Mr Rumble as 'an eccentric, shy man with a lot of creative ability and artistic flair', adding, 'the degree of detail that he has used to create the tiniest of carvings is outstanding.'

The video features a group of actors, dressed as moaning zombies, pouring out of the castles stone foyer before being shot down by an invisible shotgun

It's no wonder then, that the marketing agents opted for a different way to attract buyers as unique and eccentric as the building itself, which has been used as a tourist destination as well as hosting medieval games, corporate events and even weddings.

'We decided that we needed a different spin, we needed something fairly clever and with a high impact that was a high draw card for the audience we needed,' Ms Andrews said.

'We thought, "yep, zombies pouring out of that courtyard with those timber doors is definitely a great idea".'

In the video, Ms Andrews says to viewers: 'Well, now that I've cleaned the place up - time to come and have a look inside'

A second marketing video for the house, soon to be released, will feature a virtual tour of the property

The first marketing video for the property, features a group of actors, dressed as ragged, moaning zombies, pouring out of the castles stone foyer before being shot down by an invisible shotgun.

Ms Andrews also features in the video, and is shown exiting the property from the same doorway before stepping her way across the carcases to wipe up the blood from the camera lense.

'Well, now that I've cleaned the place up – time to come and have a look inside,'’ Ms Andrews says in the video.

It served as a family home to the Rumble family, who lived in a cottage 300 metres from the structure while it was still in its early development stages

'I've had emails going off, phones going off, all sorts of inquiries from normal residential buyers, mums and dads looking for something a little different, business owners, historical soicietys photographers looking for galleries and even genuine developers. There's a huge range of people who are interested,' she said.

'No one has said it's not acceptable for a real-estate agent to be killing zombies while  marketing a property.'

The video is to be followed by a second, which will provide viewers with a virtual tour of the buildings.
