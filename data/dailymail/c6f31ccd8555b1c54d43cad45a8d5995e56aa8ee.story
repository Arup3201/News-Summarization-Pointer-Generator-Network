The mother of a four-year-old girl who died of E. coli earlier this week has said that her daughter's final moments will haunt her forever.

Rachel Profitt, of Sandy, Oregon, lost her daughter, Serena Faith Profitt, on Monday, and that loss has taken a devastating toll on her. 

'I cannot sleep at night because of her face or tears or screams are in my mind,' she said in a recent interview.

Profitt  and her husband are especially angry at the hospital they first took their daughter to last Wednesday, Samaritan North Lincoln Hospital, for assuming she just had a simple virus.

'If I have your report and it says diagnosis No. 1 is HUS, how do you just send us home without following that? How do you send us home without pursuing that lead, your No. 1 lead,' Steven Profitt asked.

HUS, an abbreviation of hemolytic uremic syndrome, is a disease that strikes most children with E. coli.

In the days before her death, the young girl was in unbelievable pain according to her mother.

'She would be crying a lot saying, "My tummy, my tummy, Lord please my tummy,"' Rachel told KATU.

It got so bad the young girl laid on the couch with towels under her, too weak to make it to the bathroom in her final days.

A far cry from the Serena her parents normally got to see.

'She was beautiful. She was perfect. She was happy. She would laugh and smile and giggle and play,' said her mother.

It is believed that Serena fell ill after eating a turkey sandwich at Roadhouse 18 Bar and Grill in Otis, Oregon over Labor Day weekend.
