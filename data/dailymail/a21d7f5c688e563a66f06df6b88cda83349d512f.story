Twitter, YouTube and Facebook have made astronauts into overnight social media stars.

It’s about time then, that Nasa’s ISS crew added Instagram to its social media weaponry.

That's exactly what American astronaut Steven Swanson did on Monday after he became the first ever person to post on Instagram from space.

American astronaut Steven Swanson has become the first ever person to post on Instagram from space after he posted this picture of himself floating on board the ISS' cupola

And, of course, Swanson’s image was a selfie.

The photo, posted on the official Instagram account of the International Space Station, shows Stevenson floating in the ISS' cupola.

The cupola is a panoramic control tower with several windows that reveal incredible views of the galaxy.

It’s also home to sophisticated camera equipment capable of taking stunning images of Earth.

The image instantly became a hit after it was posted on the official Instagram account of the ISS

In line with the latest Instagram trend, Stevenson posted the image without any filters with a caption that reads ‘back on ISS, life is good.’

The ISS has largely been shielded from politics on Earth, after Nasa said last week that it was severing ties with Russia except for on the International Space Station.

Since the retirement of the space shuttle, Nasa has depended on Russia to hitch rides to the giant orbiting outpost.

A Russian rocket last week delivered three astronauts, including Swanson.

Swanson will assume command of Expedition 40 in May after Expedition 39 returns home. He is scheduled to return to Earth with in September.

The rise of social media on the International Space Station started in May 2009, when Nasa astronaut Mike Massimino, or @Astro_Mike, sent the first tweet from space. 

He wrote the tweet and emailed it to the Johnson Space Center, which then posted the message to his account.

In January 2010, Astronaut TJ Creamer was able to post the First Real-Time tweet from space.

His message read 'Hello Twitterverse! We r now LIVE tweeting from the International Space Station -- the 1st live tweet from Space! :) More soon, send your ?s'

In October 22, 2010 the first Foursquare check-in was made from space when astronaut Douglas H. Wheelock (@Astro_Wheels) checked in boarding the ISS and tweeted the following: I just unlocked the 'Nasa Explorer" badge on @foursquare!'
