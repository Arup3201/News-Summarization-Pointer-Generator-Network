West Ham boss Sam Allardyce revealed he was forced to leave Andy Carroll out of the club's FA Cup clash with Everton due to an injury picked up in training.

The former Newcastle and Liverpool man 'kicked the floor' in training and the Hammers' manager decided it wasn't worth risking him at Goodison Park.

Speaking on BT Sport, Allardyce said: 'Andy kicked the floor in training and obviously his foot's a bit sore so we didn't bring him with us.

'We didn't (want to) risk the fact that if he'd played today it would've probably got worse.'

Carroll has endured numerous fitness problems since joining the Hammers so fans are likely to forgive Allardyce for his caution.

In better news for the club, Alex Song may be available for selection in January after Allardyce suggested he may not play in the African Cup of Nations after all. 

Song was initially left out of the Cameroon squad after falling out with manager Volker Finke.

Finke was reportedly then pressured in to changing his mind by the country's FA and Song eventually flew out to join up with the squad.

But now Allardyce has hinted at yet another U-turn by claiming the former Arsenal midfielder may not feature in the competition.

He said: 'He's out there. We're not absolutely certain if he's staying there or not. There's been a bit of confusion over it but we'll find out in the next day or so.'
