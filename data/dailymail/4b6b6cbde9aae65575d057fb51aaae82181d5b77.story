Fans of hip hop group N-Dubz are being investigated by police after tweeting threats to kill a judge overseeing the case of former band member Dappy.

Menacing messages were posted on Twitter warning that the judge’s life or safety would be in danger if the star was sent to prison.

The performer is facing trial for affray and appeared with his co-accused earlier this months to deny the charge when his followers took to the internet. He is in no way linked to the messages.

Denies affray: Former N-Dubz star Dappy appearing at Guildford Crown Court earlier this month. Fans of the hip-hop group are being investigated by police after threatening to kill the judge if he was sent to prison over the allegations

One said: ‘Don’t go to jail!!!!!!!! Or we’ll have to kill the judge!’ before adding: ‘If @TheDappy gets sent down today then we’re all gonna go to Guildford Crown Court & kill the judge’.

Another sent a message saying: ‘I will kill those judges. Don’t worry,’ after earlier stating: ‘I will chop the judges (sic) heads off if they send Dappy to prison.’

Others suggested they too would be after the senior legal figure.

A Tweeter said that if the defendants were sent down they would ‘smash the courts up then go f*** the judge up’ and another warned they would ‘hunt the judge down’.

A spokesman for Surrey Police confirmed that officers had begun an investigation into the comments made about the resident judge at Guildford Crown Court.

Scene: Dappy and three co-defendants are accused of brawling on the forecourt of this Shell garage in Woodbridge Road, Guildford

A spokesman for the force said: ‘Surrey Police is aware of a number of comments on social media regarding a Crown Court judge and the issue is being looked into.’

He added: ‘Surrey Police will not tolerate language used in a public place, including on social media websites, which causes harassment, alarm or distress.’

Anyone who sees any such messages was asked to contact police.

The No Regrets singer, real name Dino Costas Contostavlos, appeared at Guildford Crown Court on August 23 when he and three co-accused - Kieran Patrick Vassell, Kalonji David Stewart and Alfred James Miller - were accused of brawling on a petrol station forecourt.

The incident - captured on CCTV cameras from various angles - was said to have happened at a Shell garage, in Woodbridge Road, Guildford, Surrey, at 3.30am on February 28.

Rather than remand them, Judge Christopher Critchlow, the Honorary Recorder of Guildford, showed leniency by granting an application by 25-year-old Dappy’s legal team to adjourn the trial until after the New Year so he could perform on a £1million music tour.

They have been released on unconditional bail.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
