Koalas have a unique voice box that allows them to make a 'belching' call that only large animals like elephants are capable of

Koalas might look cute but they have a unique voice box that allows them to make a ‘belching’ call that only large animals like elephants are capable of.

The Australian marsupial’s mating call is about 20 times lower in pitch than it should be, given its relatively small size, new research has found.

While the creature’s ability to make the noise has baffled scientists for years, they now believe they have discovered the koala’s secret - a specialised sound-producing organ that has never before been seen in any other land-dwelling mammal.

The key feature of this newly described organ is its location outside the voice box or the larynx.

Dr Benjamin Charlton of the University of Sussex, who led the research, said: ‘We have discovered that koalas possess an extra pair of vocal folds that are located outside the larynx, where the oral and nasal cavities connect.

‘We also demonstrated that koalas use these additional vocal folds to produce their extremely low-pitched mating calls.’

The male koala’s bellow calls are produced as a continuous series of sounds on inhalation and exhalation, similar to that of a donkey’s braying.

On inhalation, koala bellows sound a bit like snoring, but when the animals exhale, the sound is more reminiscent of belching and Dr Charlton said: ‘they are actually quite loud.’

The call is also incredibly low-pitched and more typical of an animal the size of an elephant.

Size is related to pitch as the dimensions of the laryngeal vocal folds normally constrain the lowest frequency that an animal can generate.

As a result, smaller species will typically make higher pitched calls than larger ones.

But koalas have bypassed that constraint as their vocal folds are in a different location, according to the study, which was published in journal Current Biology.

The folds are two long, fleshy lips in the soft palette, just above the larynx at the junction between the oral and nasal cavities.

They look similar to the laryngeal vocal folds of other mammals, but their location is highly unusual.

‘To our knowledge, the only other example of a specialised sound-producing organ in mammals that is independent of the larynx are the phonic lips that toothed whales use to generate echolocation clicks,’ Dr Charlton said.

The combination of biological, video and acoustic data collected in the new study represents the first evidence in a terrestrial mammal of an organ other than the larynx that is dedicated to sound production.

The scientists now plan on looking more closely at other mammals to find out whether this vocal adaptation is truly unique to koalas.
