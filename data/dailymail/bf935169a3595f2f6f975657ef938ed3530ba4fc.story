Amir Khan triumphantly returned home to his gym in Bolton and, after being confronted by a huge mural of himself, laughed off suggestions he is not a big enough name to face Floyd Mayweather. 

The welterweight  - fresh from his victory over Devon Alexander - arrived in England on Wednesday and  addressed the media on Thursday at his Gloves Community Centre in Bolton.

Khan posed for pictures in front of a giant mural of himself in his refurbished gym and with the 24-carat shorts he wore during his emphatic win over Alexander last Saturday. 

Amir Khan has announced that he will donate the £30,000 shorts he wore during his last week to charity

Khan is hoping his next fight will be against Floyd Mayweather next year

Khan put on his own gold-standard display against Alexander and won much praise on both sides of the Atlantic. He has been vocal in his desire to face  Mayweather in his next fight, but the pound-for-pound king poured cold water on the idea and has called out Manny Pacquiao. 

'The other night I think he did 4,000 (attendance), so, Amir Khan, his name holds no weight,' Mayweather told reporters during the World Boxing Council convention.

'No one knows who Amir Khan is, except for people who are involved in boxing.'

But Khan has hit back saying, 'I want the fight, but is Floyd going to take the fight? Is Floyd going to give me that chance? That's something we're all waiting to hear from Floyd Mayweather.

'I've been asking for the fight for the last two or three years. Now he needs to come back to the press and say, "I want the fight with Amir Khan". I know I'm touching distance away from that super fight. I think I've proven myself many times and I think this time I've proved myself in the biggest way so he has to take the fight. What else do I have to do?

'I have a bigger name than (Marcos) Maidana did or Victor Ortiz. I'm one of the biggest names in boxing. I know if I can bring Floyd Mayweather to Britain then I'll sell out Wembley Stadium. How big does he need my name to be?

'I think these are little excuses. I'm sure people realise that. It seems to me he doesn't want to fight me. I have the speed, dexterity, accuracy, movement, power; I think it's something that he doesn't really want to mix with.'

Mayweather says Khan's 'name holds no weight' and that he will not fight him

The chance to face Mayweather has been something Khan has long wanted. He pulled out of his original fight with Alexander last year because he believed he had a May date with the Money Man. 

However, Mayweather instead fought Marcos Maidana, leaving Britain's former Olympic silver medallist without a fight in 14 months before he took on Luis Collazo in May.

Khan says he will not make the same mistakes and will fight in May regardless of whether Mayweather says yes or no. However, it seems unlikely that he will take on IBF champion Kell Brook in a battle of Britain. 

He said: 'I'm not really interested in the Kell Brook fight. I'm looking at the biggest names in boxing. Floyd Mayweather, Manny Pacquiao, I think that's where I belong.

It is probable that Mayweather will insist on fighting Pacquiao, an eight-division champion, in his adopted hometown of Las Vegas

'If the fight doesn't happen with Floyd then maybe Manny Pacquiao is another option. I'd like to fight in May to keep myself busy and sharp. I think that helps me.

'It's very frustrating. It's just a waiting game. But this time I'm not going to wait and pull out of a fight. If it's not Mayweather, then I'm going to have to look at other opponents, but if it is Mayweather then I'm going to grab it with both hands and put on a great performance.

'I really believe I can beat him. The way I fought and the way I'm learning, I'm getting better and stronger. I really believe I have his number and maybe Floyd knows that as well.' 

Meanwhile, Khan's shorts - at £30,000 the most expensive in sporting history - will be donated to charity to help raise money for the school in Pakistan where 132 schoolchildren were shot dead by the Taliban on Tuesday.

Khan added: 'I'm going to be donating them towards what happened in Pakistan. I want to rebuild the school and strengthen the security over there.'
