QPR have accepted the resignation of Philip Beard, with the departing chief executive citing 'recent senior management changes' as the catalyst behind his decision.

Life at Loftus Road has rarely been quiet since he arrived in August 2011 following Tony Fernandes' takeover of the west London club.

Beard will now move on to pastures new on March 15 after QPR chairman Fernandes accepted the chief executive's resignation.

It is believed that Beard's move away from Loftus Road came as a consequence of feeling marginalised following Les Ferdinand's promotion to director of football.

Fernandes said: 'I would like to take this opportunity to thank Phil for his contribution to QPR and wish him well for the future.'

'In the short term we will continue to liaise with Phil regarding our long-term projects, ensuring a smooth transitional period prior to making a new appointment.

'I have high regard for Phil and he will always be welcome back at Loftus Road in the future.'
