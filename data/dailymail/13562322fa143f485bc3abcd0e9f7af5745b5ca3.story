Luxury travel company Juoni has rushed to reassure British holidaymakers that their trips are safe after the UK operation was put up for sale.

The sale of the UK operator will not affect any travel that has already been booked, but the decision to put Swiss-based Kuoni Travel Group up for sale will, however, affect 3,800 staff worldwide.

It's uncertain how many jobs could be cut in the UK.

UK travel company, Kuoni, has been put up for sale - but promises that all holidays will still be honoured 

Established 50 years ago, the Kuoni Travel UK group includes specialist businesses Carrier, Kirker, Voyage Jules Verne, CV Villas and Journeys of Distinction.

It also boasts 35 Kuoni-branded shops around the country. 

Kuoni Travel UK managing director Derek Jones said: 'In the UK market, Kuoni has an enviable reputation as the market leader for worldwide travel. 

'It's very much business as usual right now for all our staff and customers.

Among the most popular Kuoni destination is the Four Seasons Resort Kuda Huraa in the Maldives

'This is the busiest time for holiday bookings and right now our focus is on continuing to deliver brilliant holidays and service for all customers.

'We firmly believe that the outbound business can be better developed under new ownership and we'll be working closely with our colleagues in Switzerland to make sure we find the right buyers.'
