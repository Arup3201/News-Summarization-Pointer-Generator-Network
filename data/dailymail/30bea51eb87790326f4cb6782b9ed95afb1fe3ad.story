Whether she's rocking a classic sleek style or funky forward ponytail, Nicole Scherzinger never fails to look 'shamazing'.

And proving she can pull off just about any look, the songstress has got into the 70s spirit with her latest beauty campaign.

Sexy 70s: Nicole Scherzinger is the star of Herbal Essences' new campaign and rocks bouncy disco curls

To celebrate the re-launch of Herbal Essences Classic ranges, Nicole gave a nostalgic nod to the sexy seventies, a glorious era of fierce and fabulous style, by working glamorous 'disco curls', as she calls them.

Speaking about her transformation, hairdresser Ben Cooke said: 'Nicole loves the disco curl so this was a great opportunity for us to recreate one of her favourite classic looks: huge, bouncy, sexy curls.'

Shamazing! Nicole rocks the 70s style with big hair, gold hooped earrings and a Saturday Night Fever pose

Nicole's voluminous hairdo was complemented with a bold 70s-inspired full length gown from Forever Unique.

But what's her secret to looking so good? The 35-year-old revealed her inspirations, as well as her tips and tricks when it comes to achieving that polish to MailOnline.

'When I'm doing hair, I'm always like: "I
 want Brigitte Bardot or Sophia Loren hair. When I do updos I want 
Vivien Leigh's hair, I am inspired by the movie star look,' she said.

'My favourite everyday look is the big bouncy 'lady curl' waves, as I like to call them.

'It isn't quite the beachy girl look, it is 
something special. It's as if you have had heated rollers in.

'You 
blow it out, and wrap a heated tong around your hair like a
 ribbon. You then pop it up to set and let it drop out,' she explained.

Retro: Nicole shared her beauty secrets with FEMAIL and says she swears by coconut oil, lots of moisturiser and illuminator

Hawaiian-born Nicole, who was ranked VH1's Sexiest Artist of All Time this year, opened up her beauty bag - and fans will be pleased to hear that she loves a good budget buy.

'I love Dr Murad toner and I really like the Bliss Triple Oxygen Instant Energising Eye Masks, they're really tingly and I use them every other day.

'I love the SK-II Facial Treatment Mask too, it is yummy!

Get the gloss: Nicole loves a good beauty buy and often pops into her local boots to stock up on face wash

'I love my creme blushes, illuminator, and moisturiser is everything to me because it keeps your skin fresh and dewy and not too cakey.'

Sharing her budget beauty tips, she said: 'My family makes it on coconut oil so I get that for free!

'It's so healthy for the skin, it's anti-bacterial, it is everything. You can use it for your hair and skin.

'Whatever lip gloss you have, use it on your cheeks too, I do that a lot. I also love the Boots eye make-up remover pads and No. 7 has good face wash.'
