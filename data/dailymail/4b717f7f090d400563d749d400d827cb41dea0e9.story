President Barack Obama said Tuesday in Chicago that while racism-related fears of some African-Americans are 'not made up' and 'rooted in realities,' there is 'no excuse' for the violence that turned parts of Ferguson, Missouri into an urban war zone on Monday night.

'A grand jury made a decision yesterday that upset a lot of people,' he acknowledged, but framed the widespread arsons and looting as the result of 'frustrations' which are 'not just about a particular incident. they have deep roots in many communities of color.'

Race-based resentments in America, said Obama, the first black U.S. president, are 'not just made up. it's rooted in realities that have existed in this country for a long time.'

But he complained about agitators and organizers who led groups in 'burning buildings, torching cars, destroying property, putting people at risk,' instead of finding 'productive ways of responding' to a grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer for shooting a black teen in self-defense.

IMMIGRATION: The president was in Chicago to promote his immigration overhaul, a policy that polls show is wildly unpopular

'That's destructive and there's no excuse for it,' he said. 'Those are criminal acts, and people should be prosecuted if they engage in criminal acts.'

But returning to the theme of black communities fearing police forces that don't match their racial make-up, he warned that 'if any part of the American community doesn't feel welcomed or treated fairly, that's something that puts all of us at risk and we all have to be concerned about [it].'

Attorney General Eric Holder, who announced last week that he would leave his post when a replacement is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, reiterated Tuesday that his Department of Justice is pursuing twin investigations into policeman Darren Williams' shooting of Michael Brown, and into the Ferguson, Police Department as a whole.

But Obama said it was 'not my job as president to comment on ongoing investigations.'

He did offer that Holder would soon host 'regional meetings focused on building trust in our communities,' and added that there are 'very specific steps we can take to make sure law enforcement is fair.'

Turning back to the violence 300 miles to the south in suburban St. Louis, he warned protesters just an hour before nightfall that 'nothing of significance, nothing of benefit results from destructive acts.' 

'I've never seen a civil rights law or a health care bill or an immigration bill result because a car got burned.'

'Don't take the short term easy route and just engage in destructive behavior,' Obama implored. 'I have no sympathy at all for destroying your own communities.' 

The president's comments on the social unrest came at the beginning of a longer speech promoting and defending his decision last week to mainstream millions of illegal immigrants by giving them temporary get-out-of-deportation-free status until the end of his term in office.

Appearing in a predominantly Polish-American neighborhood and greeting the crowd with a greeting in Polish – 'Dzień dobry!' – he insisted that his action was justified by the positive contributions immigrants have made to America's social fabric.

The self-declared immigrant who introduced him, however, came to the U.S. legally. 

Tuesday's speech, scheduled long before the Ferguson debacle, was part of a White House strategy to broaden the appeal of his amnesty strategy beyond the Hispanic community that will benefit most. 

Three hecklers at the Copernicus Community Center, out of a crowd estimated at 1,800, interrupted Obama, yelling that he had not done enough to stop the Homeland Security Department from sending illegal immigrants back to their countries of origin.

Some in the crowd booed the activists and shouted for them to take their seats, according to a White house press pool report.

It 'doesn’t make sense to yell at me right now,' the president told them, emphasizing that he had just unveiled an aggressive policy move in their direction.

'What you're not paying attention to is, I just took an action to change the law.' 

The supportive audience applauded, but Republicans will howl at Obama's candid admission that he had 'changed' a federal law – precisely the point of view that the White House has argued in recent days was inaccurate. 

'The way the change in the law works,' he said next, 'is that we're reprioritizing how we enforce our immigration law generally.'

After listening to the hecklers awhile longer, he said, 'There are other ways of engaging. Just sit down.'
