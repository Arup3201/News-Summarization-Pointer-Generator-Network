Makeup is a precise mask used to subtly enhance features and hide blemishes.

For kids, it is a whole other world of excitement.

A group of mothers handed over the lipstick, blusher, mascara, foundation and nail varnish to their daughters aged three to six.

And the results were spectacular.

Abstract: Ashley Donoghue sports one entirely pink hand and colored streaks painted by three-year-old Aavie

Not so precise: Kristi Tetzlaff forwent her usual mascara for five-year-old Brooklyn's unusual makeover

Striking: Jill Clapton's four-year-old daughter Taze opted for a few streaks of black and purple for her mother

All 10 look more like abstract works of art, with dots of black on their chins and swathes of pink across their fingers.

One mother has dark purple lips, a black line running from her cheek bone to her neck, and small black spots underneath her eyes.

Another sports one green-powdered eye, candy pink lipstick across her face from ear-to-ear, and multi-colored nail varnish.

A third has faint smudges and drips of blue, yellow and silver on her cheeks and nose, frosty lips - and her left hand is covered in metallic pink nail varnish.

Subtle: Brandi Pahl's faint smudges of  blue and pink by Grace, four, is far from her usual touch ups

Vampy: Kerri Madsen was given fiery red lips topped off with black spots on her cheeks by Abby, four

Rosy: Shannon Shipman's five-year-old daughter Sadie evidently feels her mother should highlight her nose

The project is designed to encourage women - and men - to be more childlike in their approach to beauty.

'This series was inspired through my attempts to see beauty the same way I used to as a child,' photographer Elly Heise told RYOT about the project #DaughterDoesMyMakeup.

'I wanted to gain a better understanding through photography by trying to photograph what each girl saw when she saw her mother.

Minimalist: Denise Anne's six-year-old, Peyton, merely gave her mother a few simple dots of color

Design: Vasia Han's arm was the star of the show for her daughter Echo, who also gave her white eyebrows

Barely anything: Four-year-old Simone Knight dipped her mother Maggie's finger tips in metallic colors

'I would like all genders to learn the same thing I did from this project.

'Be more like children. Stop trying so hard to meet the narrow-minded standards of others and allow beauty to have a more broad definition in your day-to-day life.

'Be more open to try and understand the different ways people choose to assert their identities.'
