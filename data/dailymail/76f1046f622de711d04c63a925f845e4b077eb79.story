Gamers are to be allowed to use their consoles to find out how to claim benefits.

People with Sky or Virgin interactive television will also be able to access details of the new Universal Credit scheme.

Ministers said they wanted to use technology so more people know how the new welfare system will affect them, but Tory MPs warn workers are 'irritated' by benefit claimants owning expensive gadgets.

Information on Universal Credit is now available using the ‘red button’ technology on some TVs and through Nintendo's Wii console.

The Universal Credit programme merges six
 benefits into one and is intended to simplify the system and make sure 
it always pays to be in work.

But at a time when the government is trying to curb benefits spending, including a cap on how much families can receive, the idea of making it easier to apply for handouts is likely to prove controversial.

Welfare Reform Minister Lord Freud said: ‘As we continue with the rollout of Universal Credit, increasing numbers of people will need to know how it affects them and how to prepare.

‘Working with Looking Local, we have ensured as many tools as possible exist for people to find out everything they need to know about the easier-to-understand and more flexible benefit that is Universal Credit.

‘We are also making sure Universal Credit is an opportunity for people to build online skills, so they can look for work and benefit from what the online world offers for 21st century life.’

Welfare minister Lord Freud said technology would help more people to access details of Universal Credit

The TV information channels have had more than 30,000 hits since they were launched at the end of October, according to Looking Local, the organisation behind the service.

Ministers hope the TV service will help get the information on Universal Credit to the estimated seven million British adults without an internet connection.

Sky and Virgin customers with interactive TV can check if they are eligible for Universal Credit and how they can make a claim.

Looking Local, which is owned by Kirklees Council, has also designed the only public sector service interface for a games console, which Wii users can now use to view the details.

But the plan risks sparking controversy at a time when ministers are trying to take a tougher stance on benefits claims.

In the Commons yesterday Tory MP Philip Davies said TV programmes such as ‘Benefits Street’ and ‘On Benefits & Proud’ reveal how some people living on the welfare state still manage to buy expensive gadgets and luxuries.

Mr Davies said: ‘I have been struck by the number of people on them who manage to combine complaining about welfare reform with being able to afford to buy copious amounts of cigarettes, have lots of tattoos, and watch Sky TV on the obligatory widescreen television.’

He also raised ‘the concerns and irritation of many people who go to work every day and pay their taxes but cannot afford those kinds of luxuries’.

The Universal Credit project has suffered a series of setbacks and Whitehall's spending watchdog has said the DWP failed to achieve ‘value for money’ in its development and needed to adopt ‘realistic expectations’ on the timetable for its delivery.

The National Audit Office warning came after Mr Duncan Smith admitted that more than £40 million spent on IT for the project had been written off in 2012/13, with a further £91 million of software code expected to be written down in value to nil over the next five years.

Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude was forced to deny reports of a rift with Mr Duncan Smith over the project, but said its initial implementation had been ‘pretty lamentable’.
