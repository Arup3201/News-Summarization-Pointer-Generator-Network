Ed Miliband's promise to guarantee patients a GP appointment within 48 hours could cost £3billion, doctors warned today.

Labour has set aside just £100million to pay for the policy, launched last night to bolster support as polls put the Tories ahead for the first time in two years.

Today the Royal College of GPs said the £3billion would need to be found from elsewhere in the NHS to reverse the 'erosion' of funding to local surgeries over recent years.

Labour leader Ed Miliband announced plans to guarantee patients can get an appointment with their GP within 48 hours

In a speech last night Mr Miliband said it was a ‘scandal’ that many patients have to wait days to be seen by a GP, and said his party would plough hundreds of millions of pounds into cutting waiting times.

He claimed the £100million a year needed to fund shorter waiting times would be found by cutting back on NHS red tape and highly-paid consultants.

But Maureen Baker, chairman of the RCGP, said the money was not enough to fulfil the pledge.

She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'The £100 million is a start and it’s a welcome start. It’s not actually anywhere near enough to give any sort of guarantee. 

'When you look at it, it’s around about £10,000 per practice. It certainly won’t go anywhere near employing at practice level more nurses, more GPs.

'At the moment the share of NHS funding that goes to general practice is just over 8 per cent. We see about 90 per cent of all NHS consultations. We believe that our share should be around about 11 per cent.'

She said this was the equivalent of 'a rebalancing of  £3billion because that is the share of the NHS budget that historically came to general practice that let us provide the service that patients value and want'. 

Dr Baker added: 'That funding has been eroded over the years and we need to be able to balance NHS funding to deliver a proper general practice service.' 

Labour claimed that the number of patients who see a doctor within 48 hours has dropped from 80 per cent to 40 per cent under the Coalition, with one in four people have to wait a week to be seen.

Mr Miliband visited Leighton Hospital in Crewe ahead of his policy launch, which has since been criticised for a lack of funding

Mr Miliband said his ‘guarantee’ would prevent patients who cannot get an appointment with their GP flooding A&E departments and would save the NHS more than £300million.

‘This will be better for patients, because they have better access to their GP surgery; better for the NHS, because it will save money currently spent in A&E; and better for Britain, because it is the kind of health service we need’, he said.

The Conservatives called it an ‘unfunded pie in the sky policy’ and said they had scrapped the 48 hour target because doctors found it counter-productive to patient care.

Mr Miliband told an audience in Manchester that Labour would allow patients to speak to a doctor or triage nurse, rather than a receptionist on the phone straightaway. If their condition is judged to need immediate attention they can see a GP the same day.

All patients would have the right to see a GP at their own practice within 48 hours if they want to, although not necessarily the GP of their choice.

The number of patients who see a doctor within 48 hours has dropped from 80 per cent to 40 per cent under the Coalition, Mr Miliband

Chaand Nagpaul at the British Medical Association said last year when this policy was suggested that ‘arbitrary targets, even for limited periods, are unlikely to alleviate the pressures on the NHS and could make the situation worse.

He added: ‘It is likely to result in a rush for appointments when practices open which could overwhelm GP services and restrict the freedom of GPs to schedule appointments beyond 48 hours for patients with long-term conditions.’ 

Labour sources claimed the 48 hour guarantee would not be the same as the previous target, as patients who want to wait more than two days to see their own GP will still be able to.

GPs can spend the extra funding as they see fit, by hiring more staff or asking GPs to work longer hours.

The cost would be funded by cutting £78million of administration and legal fees associated with EU competition law, and reining in the £3million a month spending on consultants by three health quangos – Monitor, the Trust Development Authority and Commissioning Support Units.

Mr Miliband also told an audience of health workers that he would repeal the Health and Social Care Act– the law putting GPs back in charge of health budgets.

A Conservative Party spokesman said: 'Once again Labour's sums simply don't add up. Ed Miliband promised 'iron discipline' on spending, but he's too weak to stick to it. He's got no economic plan to secure Britain's future. 

'All he does offer are more of the same old failed Labour policies from the past - more spending, more borrowing and more taxes.'
