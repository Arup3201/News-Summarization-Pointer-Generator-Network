A hateful roadside sign blaming Africa for disease and Barack Obama has sparked outrage in Nebraska.  

On Monday a resident erected a sign reading, 'Aids, Ebola, Obama, Thanks Africa' on his property off of Highway 10 in the town of Minden. 

The sign was taken down within hours of being put up, but not before it was widely shared across social media and condemned by local residents and officials. 

A hateful roadside sign blaming Africa for disease and Barack Obama was erected by a man near a highway in Minden, Nebraska, and was soon shared across social media

Mayor-elect Ted Griess said he received an email 'to the effect it was creating quite a stir in the community'.

He told NBC Nebraska: 'It was being transferred all the way across this nation from one Facebook account to the next.'

Mr Griess tracked down the owner of the sign and after reasoning with him it was taken down. 

The man's name has not been released.

The sign thanked Africa for the Ebola crisis which has claimed more than 5,000 lives; health workers in Guinea are pictured preparing to move the body of a victim who died from the virus

Mr Griess said: 'It was so large and it was coming into the community alongside the highway and, as the mayor-to-be, I didn't want that type of image to be portrayed in Minden, Nebraska. We're called the Christmas City.'

Current Minden Mayor Roger Jones said he thought the sign was 'stupid' and couldn't 'believe anybody would do that'.

The sign also upset local residents. Bruce Lindstrom said he was 'stunned that America has come to this place where hatred and the vitriol is so wide open'.
