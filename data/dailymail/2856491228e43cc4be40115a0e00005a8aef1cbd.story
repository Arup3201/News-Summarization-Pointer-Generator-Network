A mother has vowed that family life will carry on life as normal despite being told that her husband and baby son are both fighting for their lives.

Nahella Hard, 32, was told her husband has brain tumour just eight days after she learnt her baby has brain damage.

But the mother-of-two is refusing to let the double tragedy affect their daily lives.

Nahella Hard, 32, was told her husband, Anthony, 33, has brain tumour just eight days after she learnt her baby, 18-month-old Casey, has severe brain damage

She said: ‘We were a happy family before this and we will carry on the same way.

‘Every moment with my boys is a blessing and we just take each day as it comes.’

Mrs Hard went into labour in November 2011 with her husband Anthony, 33, at her side.

There were complications during the birth but the couple took baby Casey home unaware there was anything wrong.

However, when he didn’t develop normally doctors carried out an MRI scan and found that he had extensive brain damage.

The couple were still reeling from the blow when Mr Hard had a seizure at his RAF base, after suffering from headaches.

Casey was born in November 2011 and despite a traumatic birth, his parents took him home without knowing there was anything wrong with him. When he failed to develop normally, tests revealed he had brain damage

Just eight days after the couple learnt that Casey had brain damage, Mr Hard had a seizure at work and was taken for a scan which revealed he has a brain tumour

He was sent to hospital for a brain scan where a grade two tumour was discovered.

Mrs Hard said: ‘It was devastating - one minute I thought I had a healthy husband and son, the next I was told I could lose them both.

‘The doctors said the left side of Casey’s brain had dissolved and the remaining right side looked smashed and moth eaten.

‘Anthony had been struggling with headaches for a while, then he had a seizure in front of one of his senior officers in the RAF.

Mr Hard (pictured with Casey) had surgery to remove the tumour but after a brief period of remission, it returned. He will now have further surgery and radiotherapy but the cancer is not curable

‘They sent to him to a military hospital where they found the tumour. It was just dreadful.’

But the couple, from Newport, South Wales, promised each other they would carry on as normal, especially for their daughter Teagan, nine.

Mrs Hard said: ‘Casey is 18-months-old now and he has beaten the odds to get here.

‘Doctors said he’d never smile or laugh or engage with us but he is a survivor.

‘Anthony is the backbone of our family. He is so calm, so positive. He helps me to keep going day to day.

‘Treatment will buy us more time together but there is no cure now.

‘Anthony is a fighter, if the doctor’s give him ten years he’ll want twenty.’

Mr Hard underwent brain surgery to remove the tumour but after a brief period of remission the aggressive cancer returned.

Mrs Hard says that she will do everything possible to ensure that family life carries on as normal for the sake of the couple's daughter, Teagan, nine

Mr Hard said: 'I'm so proud of our family. We've been through so much and Nahella has been incredible. She's the most amazing wife and mum'

Now doctors can only buy Mr Hard time with radiotherapy and surgery to ‘chip away’ at the tumour.

Mrs Hard spends her days caring for her two ‘boys’ while getting on with the job of being a housewife and mother to Teagan.

Whatever the future holds the family say they will stay positive.

Mr Hard said: ‘It’s the only way we can be - it really makes you appreciate the small things, the smiles, the cuddles.

‘I’m so proud of our family. We’ve been through so much and Nahella has been incredible. She’s the most amazing wife and mum.’
