If you happened to have walked through Cambridge recently, you may have noticed something strange occurring to the pathways.  

In particular, a stretch between the city centre and the Grafton Centre seems to be shining in dark with a peculiar blue glow.

Aliens, however, haven’t landed. Instead, scientists from Surrey have decided to spray the pathway with something called ‘Starpath’.

A spray-on coating that makes ordinary pathways glow in the dark could replace street lighting in the future, according to Surrey-based Pro-Teq Surfacing

Starpath is a luminescent, rain-resistant coating that aims to replace street lights throughout the UK.

The coating is applied in three layers, with a middle aggregate stage that absorbs UV energy during the day, which is then released as a blue glow when it's dark.

The system uses polyurethane base and a polyaspartic topcoat that seals the whole thing together.

According to the Pro-Teq Surfacing, the company behind the technology, it can be applied to almost any solid surface including tarmac, concrete and wood.

A path across Christ's Pieces in Cambridge which glows in the dark is the first of its kind in the world. The illumination comes from ultraviolet particles in the pavement at the Cambridge beauty spot which absorb energy during the day and release it as light overnight

Starpath reacts to varying levels of light. If the sky is lighter, such as on the left, it won’t release as much luminosity. At night (right) it glows brighter. 'It’s almost like it has a mind of its own,' said Hamish Scott

Unlike those glow in the dark stars you used to stick on your walls, Starpath reacts to varying levels of ambient light. 

‘This product adjusts to the natural light, so if it is pitch black outside the luminous natural earth enhances,’ said Hamish Scott, owner of Pro-Teq Surfacing.

‘If the sky is lighter, it won’t release as much luminosity – it adjusts accordingly, it’s almost like it has a mind of its own.’

Reports suggest the group could begin to use different colours in order to create a cycle lane during the night.

While the technology is currently being trailed at Christ's Pieces in Cambridge, the council sad they are now considering using the path elsewhere in the city.

With some councils turning off lights at night, Pro-Teq claims Starpath could be a viable, low-maintenance alternative to keep people safe in the dark. 

The Cambridge pathway measures 150 square metres and took only 30 minutes to spray the material on. The surface was ready for use less than four hours after the job commenced
