The FBI has admitted it spied on Nelson Mandela during his first visit to the U.S. after he spent 27 years behind bars. 

Agents recruited an insider from the South African leader's own circle who provided the FBI with his itinerary for the trip in June 1990. 

A memo dated May, 30, 1990, from the Atlanta office to the then FBI Director William Sessions confirms the FBI had an informant.

At the time the CIA had been accused of providing information to apartheid authorities in South Africa which led to Mandela's arrest in 1962. 

Mandela was the leader of the African Natoinal Congress which was deemed by the U.S. to be a 'terrorist organisation' and was only removed from the list in 2008.

According to the memo, a member of Coretta Scott King's staff had the itinary drawn up for Mandela's trip to Atlanta.

Coretta Scott King was the widow of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

The informant also said Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan wanted to meet Mandela but this did not happen until 1996 when Mandela was South African president. 

The 334 page document was released following a Freedom of Information request by campaigner Ryan Shapiro.

However, 169 pages were withheld on national security grounds. 

Mr Shapiro is suing the National Security Agency, CIA and Defense Intelligence Agency for the records on Mandela. 

He told Al Jazeera: 'What's missing from these documents is often as illuminative as what's disclosed.

'Not only did the FBI heavily redact and withhold documents, but there's virtually no discussion of U.S intelligence community involvement prior to Mandela's 1990 release from prison.' 

It is likely the FBI was concerned about keeping Mandela safe during his visit. 

A letter dated May 26, 1990, to a Houston newspaper read: 'Remember John F. Kennedy in Dallas?? Bring this black murderer to Houston and we will give him a welcome the world will not forget!!!'

Fingerprints were taken from the letter by the FBI but the person who wrote it was never caught. 

A memo sent to an FBI agent on June 18, 1990, read: '[Department of State] representatives have classified the threat level for this visit as "high," and threats to harm Mr Mandela have been received.'

One log specifically said Mandela would be assassinated 'either in Atlanta or Miami.'

Thousands of Americans gathered to see Mandela during his 11-day stay in the U.S in 1990.

The South African leader died aged 95 at his Johannesburg home in December last year after a prolonged lung infection. 

His nation and the world were plunged into mourning for the man hailed by global leaders as a moral giant.

Politicians and celebrities posted their tributes to the great South African upon hearing of his death.

U.S. President Barack Obama said the world had lost 'one of the most influential, courageous and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this earth'.

After almost 50 years of ruthless segregation, Nelson Mandela brought black and white South Africans together as equal partners in a new democracy.

The man jailed for 27 years healed the wounds of apartheid, rising above personal animosity and revenge to become revered across the globe.
