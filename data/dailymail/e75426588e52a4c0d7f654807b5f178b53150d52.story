A woman who was sentenced to life in prison as a teenager for killing her former pimp has been released under a new California law that allows for the re-sentencing of certain inmates convicted as juveniles.

Sara Kruzan was paroled Thursday from Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla after serving 19 years.

Kruzan was just 17 when she was told she
would die in prison for the 1994 shooting of George Gilbert Howard in a
Riverside motel room.

She said Howard sexually assaulted her at an early age and she began working for him as a prostitute at 13.

Prosecutors said Kruzan was no longer working for Howard when she killed him.

In
January, a Riverside County judge reduced Kruzan's conviction to 
second-degree murder, making her immediately eligible for parole.

The decision to free her was taken last Friday after Californian Governor Jerry Brown decided not to contest a state parole board decision to let her leave jail.

Her case became a high-profile 
example used by state Sen. Leland Yee, D-San Francisco, who sought to 
soften harsh life sentences for juveniles.

'It is justice long overdue,' Yee told the Los Angeles Times.

He called Kruzan's case the 'perfect example of adults who failed her, of society failing her.

'You had a predator who stalked her, raped her, forced her into prostitution, and there was no one around.'

Kruzan's case garnered widespread publicity in 2010 after Human Rights Watch posted a six-minute interview with her on YouTube.

Clemency: Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger commuted her sentence to 25-years-to-life with the possibility of parole on his last full day in office

That year culminated with Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger commuting her sentence to 25-years-to-life with the 
possibility of parole on his last full day in office. 

Schwarzenegger said he still considered 
her guilty of first-degree murder, but he sympathized with her defense 
that the man she killed had sexually abused her and served as her pimp 
for years.

'Given Ms. Kruzan's age at the time of the murder, and considering the significant abuse she suffered at his hands, I believe Ms. Kruzan's sentence is excessive,' the governor wrote in his commutation message.

'It is apparent that Ms. Kruzan suffered significant abuse starting at a vulnerable age.'

In January, a Riverside judge further reduced her first-degree murder conviction to second degree, making her immediately eligible for release.

Yee's legislation to allow new sentencing hearings for juveniles sent to prison for life without parole became law in January.

Approved: Governor Jerry Brown has decided to allow freedom to a woman who received a life sentence when she was a teen for killing her former pimp

In September, Brown signed a second bill requiring parole boards to give special consideration to juveniles tried as adults who have served at least 15 years of lengthy sentences.

Advocates estimate that there are more than 1,000 prisoners already eligible for parole hearings under that new law.

Brown's decision on Kruzan's case came nearly two weeks before the deadline for his action.

Kruzan was housed at the Central California Women's Facility in Chowchilla.

Her aunt told the Associated Press she wasn't surprised by the governor's action.

'I just wondered why it took so long,' Ann Rogen of Riverside said.
