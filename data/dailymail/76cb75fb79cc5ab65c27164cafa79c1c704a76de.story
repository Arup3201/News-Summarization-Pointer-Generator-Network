Sebastian Vettel will sit out the rest of practice on Friday ahead of the Spanish Grand Prix due to an electrical fault with his Red Bull.

The reigning four-times Formula One champion completed just four laps of the opening 90-minute practice session at the Circuit de Catalunya in Barcelona before parking his car on the side of the track.

Although the RB10 was returned to the garage on the back of a flat-bed truck, and the team had 50 minutes to work on the issue, it has since been discovered the problem is too complex to fix in one day.

Via their Twitter feed, the team said: 'Due to an electrical problem that has damaged the wiring loom of Car No. 1, Sebastian will not be able to take part in FP2.

'The team will use the time to fix it to be ready for FP3 tomorrow.'

Ahead of this weekend's return to action after a recent mini-break, Red Bull opted to change the chassis on Vettel's car.

The 26-year-old has so far endured a rough campaign in his bid for a fifth successive title, notably in the last two races being asked to move aside for team-mate Daniel Ricciardo due to a lack of pace.

Vettel had hoped the change of chassis would bring with it a change of luck, albeit appreciating there would unlikely be any difference in performance.

Instead, the German described it as 'a sanity check', to eradicate any possible demons inside his head he may have associated with his current form.

With 33 points from the four grands prix to date, Vettel trails championship leader Nico Rosberg by 46 points.

This latest problem is unlikely to alleviate the feeling that things are going against him this season.
