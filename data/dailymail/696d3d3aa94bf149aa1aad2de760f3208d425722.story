Two Pennsylvania brothers were charged with theft, conspiracy and receiving stolen property after allegedly stealing nearly $500,000 worth of sewer grates and selling them for scrap metal.

Brian Vetrulli, 36, and John Vetrulli Jr, 38, of Gilbertsville, were arrested on Saturday in the King of Prussia section of Upper Merion Township in their white 2013 Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck.

Police were alerted to the truck because it matched the description of a vehicle believed to be involved in the thefts of 13 iron sewer grates from parking lots in the area.

After the vehicle was stopped, 'officers noticed a large pry bar [crowbar] in the bed of the truck', according to  police.

The truck contained receipts from scrap metal dealers dating back to December 12, 2014, that indicated the brothers had sold off more than 1,000 grates for about $9 apiece. 

Investigators discovered the younger Vetrulli already had an outstanding warrant for theft  and when police questioned the brothers, they reportedly confessed to the 13 thefts in Upper Merion Township.

The Vetrullis also confessed to grabbing grates in Philadelphia, Limerick, Collegeville, Plymouth Meeting, Willow Grove, Abington, Bensalem, Haverford, Broomall, Upper Providence, and Montgomeryville.

At this point, investigators believe the Vetrulli brothers 'caused approximately $500,000 worth of loss throughout five counties in approximately one month' as the iron grates cost nearly $475 to replace.

They are being held at the Montgomery County Correctional Facility on $10,000 cash bail and a hearing has been scheduled for January 30.
