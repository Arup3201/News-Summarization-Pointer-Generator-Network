A girl gang of Bulgarian pickpockets who targeted the disabled and blind in a campaign of thieving on public transport have been jailed.

Gergina Georgjeva, 21, Dimitra Miteva, 33, and Parashkeva Ilieva, 40, stole mobile phones and purses from people on buses across London in a ‘deliberate campaign to make money’.

One of the their victims was a blind woman on crutches.

The trio from Tottenham, north London, used a strategy where two of them would stand near their target while the third acted as the ‘dipper’ to swipe the item.

They have been jailed for four months.

Prosecutor Gavin Ludlow-Thompson said the blind woman, Patricia Cairns was an easy target for their attack in February.

He said: ‘She was a severely disabled person who is blind and also gets around on crutches. She therefore presented to the team, if I can call them that, an easy target.’

Miss Cairns became aware that something was amiss and tried to signal to the bus driver but the trio fled, pushing the emergency button which released the doors.

Later that same day, the pickpockets stole an iPhone from a man waiting at a bus stop and on March 31 they stole a woman’s purse on board a bus in Stoke Newington, north London.

They were also caught on CCTV pickpocketing in Sydenham and Brixton in south London and Tottenham in north London.

In sentencing them, Judge Anthony Leonard QC said: ‘You acted as a group or in pairs of individually as professional thieves on those who were using buses through a wide area of London. 

‘It included the theft of a blind and disabled person who I judge to be a vulnerable person.

‘Each of you may show your remorse now but that does not affect the fact that this was a deliberate campaign by the three of you to make money.

‘These offences are so serious that a fine alone or community order could not be justified.’

Police were not aware the women lived and pickpocketed together until after investigations two separate arrests.

Georgjeva was arrested on May 9 and received a five-week sentence for a similar matter.

Two weeks later the other two were arrested when undercover cops saw them acting suspiciously.

It was when police searched their house that they discovered Georgjeva also lived with them and was part of the gang.

The stolen items have never been recovered but Georgjeva was charged with handling stolen goods and theft after a purse and Oyster card were found in her possession.

Mateva and Ilieva claimed they came to the UK to find legitimate work to pay for medical care of their children with heart conditions back home in Bulgaria but fell into a life of crime, their lawyers said.
