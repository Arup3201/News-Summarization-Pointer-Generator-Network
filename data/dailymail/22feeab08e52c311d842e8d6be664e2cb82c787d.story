A football coach who allegedly shot a man four years ago was pummeled by the same individual last Wednesday, when the man took his son to a sign-up event where the coach was present and recognized him.

KOMO reported the encounter  took place August 27 at Seattle's Southwest Athletic Complex, after the man's son signed up to play for a different boys' team.

The father said 'You're the dude that shot me' - and the coach said 'Yeah, I shot you,' according to a police report obtained by the affiliate station.

The coach was beaten and left unconscious by the angry father, as parents 'said they were calling 911,' KOMO said.

According to ABC News, the report said the father 'began to leave the field and head back towards the parking lot, yelling back at all of the parents saying things to the effect of "I'm going to come back and shoot the whole place up!"'

The father suffered a gunshot wound in 2010 inside a bar but 'declined to give police a statement or press charges,' ABC News reported.

The football coach - who fled - must offer his statement to the Seattle Police Department before charges may be filed against the father, ABC News reported.

The Seattle Police Department did not immediately return a request for information from MailOnline.
