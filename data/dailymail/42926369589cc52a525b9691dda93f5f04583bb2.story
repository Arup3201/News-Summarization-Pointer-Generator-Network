It was one hell of a strike to announce yourself to the Barclays Premier League - but perhaps we should expect nothing less from someone who goes by the nickname 'Superman'.

Enner Valencia's 70mph missile for West Ham in their 2-2 draw with Hull City on Monday night left the KC Stadium and the millions watching on TV open-jawed in amazement.

As well as being an early contender for the goal of the season award, it offered hope to the Hammers faithful that this season might be more than another miserable relegation struggle.

But who is the man with rockets in his boots? Here's a look at Valencia's career so far, from Ecuador to the East End.

EARLY YEARS

Enner Remberto Valencia Lastra was born in San Lorenzo, an Ecuadorian port town located 12 miles south of the Colombian border and about four hours' drive north from the capital Quito, on November 4, 1989.

His childhood was spent kicking a ball around and at the age of 16, he left home to join the youth ranks at Caribe Junior, the same club that nurtured the talents of his namesake Antonio Valencia (no relation).

He was originally a winger but gradually converted into a striker when it became apparent that he packed a fearsome shot.

After three years there, Enner was spotted by Emelec, one of the country's most prominent teams based in the city of Guayaquil.

In an interview back in his homeland, Enner's father said his son was so passionate about football he would get all his chores out the way and even skip dinner to make sure he could spend the rest of his day kicking a ball around.

Segun Remberto Valencia said: 'He did all his chores when he came home from school - milk cows, pack and load products and clear water from the canoe - and then would not eat to go and play soccer.'

Valencia hails from Afro-Ecuadorian stock and from a very poor area of the country. When he arrived in Guayaquil, he had no money for lodgings and had to sleep at the club's George Capwell Stadium.

It took a little time for the forward to break into the first team but under Argentine coach Jorge Sampaoli, the man who led Chile at the World Cup this summer, he started getting opportunities.

His first goal for Emelec came on March 10, 2010 away to their rivals LDU Quito, helping secure a vital win. The goals had begun to flow.

A RELIABLE GOALSCORER

Valencia quickly became a fixture in the Emelec side and contributed nine league goals in 30 outings during the 2011 campaign.

Unfortunately, his efforts were in vain as the team lost 1-0 to Deportivo Quito over the two legs of the Championship final, the second year in succession they had missed out at this point.

Incredibly the following year it happened again and in heart-breaking circumstances as city rivals Barcelona trumped them.

But while the team missed out, it was Enner's most successful season yet, with 13 goals in 40 league appearances.

His scoring feats didn't escape the notice of national team manager Reinaldo Rueda and Enner made his debut on February 12, 2012 in a friendly with Honduras.

SUCCESS AT LAST

It was fourth time lucky for Enner and Emelec in 2013. The forward scored a number of crucial goals as the club ended its 11-year wait for the title.

He was also the top scorer in the Copa Sudamericana, the South American equivalent of the Europa League, with five goals in four matches. Emelec didn't advance beyond the second round, however.

But it was enough to attract the attention of Mexican side Pachuca and a deal was agreed in January this year.

Enner Valencia earned his 'Superman' nickname while in his final season at Emelec. 

Fans admired his power and pace, not to mention his uncanny ability to pop up and score a vital goal at the perfect moment. 

Enner immediately found the Mexican Liga to his liking and in just 17 outings during the second half of the regular season he notched 12 goals.

In the end-of-season play-offs, he scored a hat-trick in a 4-2 away win at Pumas and a vital goal in the semi-final, second leg at Santos.

And when he scored twice more in a 3-2 first leg win over Leon in the final, Pachuca looked odds-on for success.

However, they blew it, losing 2-0 at home after extra time to end the season on a low note.

INTERNATIONAL RECOGNITION

Following the tragic death of Christian Benitez in July 2013, opportunities opened up for Enner and his form in Ecuador's 2014 friendlies made him a natural choice for the World Cup.

The first time an English audience caught a glimpse of his abilities was when he powered a bullet header past Ben Foster in the early stages of Ecuador's 2-2 draw with England in Miami just before the finals.

He again demonstrated his aerial prowess to put Ecuador ahead in their opening World Cup match with Switzerland and grabbed two more in the win over Honduras a few days later. His efforts weren't enough to secure a last 16 berth, however, as Switzerland progressed alongside France.

Enner was firmly in the shop window and his value rocketed.

LONDON CALLING

Amid interest from a number of European clubs, West Ham tabled a £12m bid and secured Enner's signature on a five-year contract at the end of July.

Upon arriving in London, he said: 'I really appreciate the welcome I've bene given and I'm excited to be here.

'I've already watched and read a lot about the club to learn about it - I know the fans are really passionate and I'm really glad to have signed.'

He came off the bench to replace Carlton Cole with nine minutes remaining of the opening day clash with Tottenham.

But it was THAT goal against Hull that really signalled his arrival in England and Hammers fans will hope it's the first of many.
