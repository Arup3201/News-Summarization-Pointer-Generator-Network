Russia and China have the blood of Syrian children on their hands, David Cameron suggested yesterday.

The Prime Minister effectively blamed the countries for the torture and killing of children by Bashar al-Assad’s regime because they have refused to sanction any intervention by the United Nations  in the war-torn Middle East state.

The failure to act had left a ‘terrible stain on the reputation of the UN’, he said at the UN General Assembly in New York.

Speech: David Cameron addresses the 67th session of the United Nations General Assembly in New York today

Citing a report by the charity Save 
the Children, Mr Cameron told delegates: ‘If anyone was in any doubt 
about the horrors that Assad has inflicted on his people, just look at 
the evidence published this week; schools used as torture centres, 
children as target practice.

‘A 16-year-old Syrian called Wael who
 was detained in a police station in Dera’a said: “I have seen children 
slaughtered. No, I do not think I will ever be okay again”.

‘The blood of these young children is
 a terrible stain on the reputation of this United Nations. And in 
particular, a stain on those who have failed to stand up to these 
atrocities and in some cases aided and abetted Assad’s reign of terror.

Angry: In a thinly-veiled attack at the UN General Assembly in New York, Mr Cameron effectively blamed the pair for the torture and killing of children by Bashar al-Assad's brutal regime

Unhappy: The Prime Minister cited a report by Save the Children this week which highlighted the appalling impact of the civil war on Syria's young people

Mr Cameron denounced the killing of US ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens (right) earlier this month as a ‘despicable act of terrorism’.

But
 he added that he was inspired by the response of the Libyan public, who
 were not prepared to allow extremists to ‘hijack their chance for 
democracy’.

He said: ‘The 
right response is to finish the work Chris Stevens gave his life to. And
 that's what the vast majority of Libyans want too.’

‘If the United Nations Charter is to 
have any value in the 21st Century we must now join together to support a
 rapid political transition.’

Russia and China have repeatedly blocked UN action against Assad.

Although he did not name the 
countries, Mr Cameron’s aides confirmed his remarks were directed at 
them.

The angry tone of his speech risks sparking a diplomatic row.

Before his address Mr Cameron held a 30-minute meeting with Egypt’s new president Mohamed Morsi.

British sources said President Morsi had urged him to step up pressure on Russia and China to end their veto over UN action.

With no sign of movement in their 
positions, aides admit there is little the West can do. Britain 
yesterday announced an extra £8million in aid to Syria but has stopped 
short of arming the rebels.

'Today
 is not the time to turn back - but to keep the faith and redouble our 
support for open societies, and for people’s demands for a job and a 
voice'

Prime Minister David Cameron

The Prime Minister also argued that 
the West should continue to back the uprisings of the Arab Spring, 
despite the civil war in Syria and fears that they could result in 
Islamists seizing control.

He said: ‘Today is not the time to 
turn back – but to keep the faith and redouble our support for open 
societies, and for people’s demands for a job and a voice.’

In a swipe at Tony Blair he 
criticised governments that had cosied up to Arab dictators in the past 
‘on the basis that they would both keep their people safe at home and 
promote stability in the region and the wider world. In fact, neither 
was true.’

War-torn country: Syrian army soldiers talk to residents in the Al-Arqoub area of Aleppo, Syria, on Tuesday

Blast: Black smoke rises from Syria's army command headquarters in Damascus earlier today

A Syrian rebel bomb attack reduced the
 army headquarters in Damascus to a smouldering wreck today as world
 leaders, unable to break the diplomatic deadlock in the conflict, met 
at the United Nations.

The rebels said the assault on President Bashar al-Assad’s power base in the centre of the capital killed dozens of people.

The
 army said four guards were killed and 14 wounded in what it said were 
suicide attacks.

No senior officers were hurt in the blasts, which shook
 the whole city just before the start of the working day, it said.

It
 was the biggest attack in Damascus since July 18 when a bombing killed 
several senior security officials, including Assad’s brother-in-law, the
 defence minister and a general.

State
 television showed CCTV footage of a white minibus pulling up by the 
side of the road and exploding in a ball of flames.

It showed another 
blast 10 minutes later, apparently inside the complex.
