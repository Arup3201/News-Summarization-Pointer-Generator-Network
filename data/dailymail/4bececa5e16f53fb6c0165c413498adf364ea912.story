From robots that mix mai tais and mojitos to an electronic wristband and apps that put everything at passengers’ fingertips, the world’s newest cruise ship is wired with ground-breaking ‘smart’ technology aimed at taking the stress out of holidays.

When Royal Caribbean International’s Quantum of the Seas officially sets sail in November, guests will be super-connected with a host of industry firsts intended to maximise their getaway even before they step on board.

It is billed as ‘the world’s most futuristic and advanced ship’, and television presenter Jason Bradbury says the technological advancements will create a hassle-free holiday, especially for parents who dread the thought of getting luggage sorted and waiting an eternity to check in.

Wired: Royal Caribbean International's newest ship, the Quantum of the Seas, has ground-breaking ‘smart’ technology aimed at taking the stress out of holidays

There's an app for that: Cruise Planner and Royal iQ allow passengers to research and book restaurant reservations and communicate with other guests

Shaken, not stirred: In the Bionic Bar, guests order drinks on tablets and then sit back and watch robots mix and deliver the cocktail of choice

Jewel of the seas: The exclusive North Star, a capsule attached to an arm, lifts passengers more than 300 feet over the ocean

 

One of the innovative features unveiled today is a gadget normally reserved for the likes of James Bond. When they step foot on the ship, passengers will receive a wristband that serves as a room key while allowing them to quickly navigate the enormous vessel and make purchases with a simple tap.

With a pair of downloadable apps that put guests in the captain’s chair, Royal Caribbean is striving to make every journey on the Quantum of the Seas the most technologically-driven holiday in the world.

The apps – Cruise Planner and Royal iQ – put guests in charge of their cruise choices, allowing them to research and book restaurant reservations, shore excursions and spa appointments on their own while organising their calendar and keeping in touch with other passengers and loved ones at home.

Passengers will be able to browse the apps, check their email or video chat with relatives or friends – all from the high seas – on a broadband connection that offers the fastest internet speeds at sea, according to Royal Caribbean.

Giant: The massive 4,180-passenger vessel weighs 167,800 registered tonnes and has 18 decks, making it the third largest ship in the world

Relaxing: By day, a venue called Two70 is a place where passengers can chill out and take in 270-degree views of the sea

High fliers: At night, Two70 transforms into an entertainment venue featuring high-flying aerialists and performers

Bradbury, host of The Gadget Show and Motor Morphers on Channel 5, has partnered with Royal Caribbean to promote its Quantum class ships. He said holidaymakers will be blown away because the systems are seamless and easy to use.

He said: ‘The app is almost like a kind of on board social network so you can socialise in the digital sense with the crew and the captain and the people who make the decisions that affect you.

‘They really thought about making some really smart decisions that make sure all your expectations are met.’

Bradbury is a big fan of Royal Caribbean’s attempts to appease the modern, tech-savvy traveller with faster internet speeds. Sluggish connections have long been a sore spot for cruise ship passengers.

Royal Caribbean is promising industry-leading bandwidth with speeds matching the fast connections people enjoy at home, using a new generation of mid-Earth orb satellites.

And it’s not just guests who will be using apps to make life easier. Crew members will use custom apps to keep track of guests’ choices for dining or spa treatments and tailor services to them.

To make that happen, Royal Caribbean is giving a tablet computer to every crew member – 40,000 in total – on every one of its ships. 

Bionic Bar: Quantum of the Seas' robot bartenders are not just the first at sea – they’re the first of their kind anywhere in the world

Impressive: Quantum of the Seas was floated out of a dry dock in Germany earlier this month and will make its maiden voyage to North America in November

A new feature that is sure to wow passengers is found in the Bionic Bar, a brand new venue where robot bartenders will be put to work.

These robot bartenders are not just the first at sea – they’re the first of their kind anywhere in the world.

Guests order drinks on tablets and then sit back and watch the robotic arms do their thing as they mix and deliver the cocktail of choice.

Bradbury said: ‘There’s a lot of show-stopping technology that’s on board these Quantum class ships, and [the robots] are the real items of interest.

‘All you will see behind the bar are the robots and if you choose a specific drink they will make it for you using very complex, rehearsed movements.

‘To interface with the public at sea, it’s really extraordinary. This isn’t something just for the launch, this is a permanent part, an important part of your entertainment experience and it’s very, very exciting and innovative.’

Robotics are also at work in Two70, a cavernous space that is a place of relaxation during the day, with 270-degree views from the aft of the ship, before it becomes a boisterous entertainment venue at night.

The venue has six ‘roboscreens’ that move or unite as one and a new feature called Vistarama, which transforms Two70’s floor-to-ceiling windows into a canvas for a digital show – real or imagined – using 18 projectors.

Quantum of the Seas’ staterooms – the largest of any Royal Caribbean ship – are equipped with USB outlets that allow guests to charge their smartphones, tablets or laptop computers.

The ship’s exclusive ‘SMART’ system helps guests even before they step foot on one of the Quantum class ships.

Passengers can generate boarding documents online, upload their own security photo and receive digital boarding confirmations.

The system is aimed at making the check-in process a breeze for passengers, with guests being able to go from ‘shoreside to ship’ in 10 minutes with no check-in counter to navigate and no lines to stand in.

Using their smartphones, guests can track their luggage in real time – from the drop-off point to their room – once it is tagged with RFID (radio frequency identification) technology at drop-off.

But the real fun begins when they get onboard. The technological advancements unveiled today will be available on two other Quantum class ships – the Anthem of the Seas, which goes into service next April, and a third liner that has not been named.

Quantum of the Seas is the third largest cruise ship in the world behind two other Royal Caribbean liners – the Allure of the Seas and Oasis of the Seas.

It will offer several first-at-sea experiences, including the North Star pod that lifts passengers more than 300 feet over the sea, a skydiving simulator, bumper cars and roller skating.

The ship’s connectivity makes it possible for one of its venues to become a video gaming suite where guests can compete with other gamers worldwide or on other Royal Caribbean ships using Xbox Live.

For foodies, Quantum of the Seas has 18 restaurants, including an Italian diner from Jamie Oliver.

The massive 4,180-passenger vessel weighs 167,800 registered tonnes and has 18 decks. It emerged from a dry dock in Germany earlier this month and will undergo sea trials next month once all of its functions are tested and the finishing touches are applied to its exterior and interior.

Quantum of the Seas will make its maiden voyage from Southampton to a port near New York on 2 November. From there, it will sail to destinations in the Caribbean, including the Bahamas and Bermuda, before it relocates to an emerging market in Shanghai, China in 2015.

Two-night cruise packages are priced at about £500, while a 10-night excursion will set you back about £1,400.

Starting next April, its sister ship, Anthem of the Seas, will sail from Southampton to destinations on the Mediterranean Sea.
