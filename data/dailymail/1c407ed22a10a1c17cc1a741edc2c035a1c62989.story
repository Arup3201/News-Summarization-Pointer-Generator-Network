As London makes its final preparations ahead of Friday's Olympic opening ceremony, it appears that it's not just humans getting into the Games spirit.

This set of guinea pigs show that they also want a piece of the action as they take to the track, field and pools for a funny calendar to celebrate the event.

Maverick Arts Publishing created a calender called the 'Guinea Pig Games - Going for Gold' and shows what our furry friends would look like if they took part in sporting events.

The side-splitting Guinea Pig Games 
2013 calendar features the furry creatures competing in major sports 
events including rowing, track cycling and javelin.

They are also seen rowing, tackling the marathon and sprinting in a close-run relay race.

And the competitive critters aren't afraid to get their paws wet in synchronised diving, swimming and open-water sailing.

But animals lovers need not fear that 
the furry creatures were made to compete for real, the humorous calendar
was created using clever image manipulation techniques.

Digital tricks allowed designers to make the guinea pigs appear to form sporty poses.

In fact, they were photographed in a comfortable studio for no more than five minutes at one time and with plenty of treats.

The guinea pigs were loaned by a animal rescue centre and a trained handler was on hand to make sure the photoshoot stars were looked after.

Steve Bicknell, owner of publishers Maverick Arts, said: 'Guinea Pig Games is one of our most successful calendars. This year we have created a stunning array of guinea pig images, showing our little furry friends competing in all the major events.

'We hired the guinea pigs from Palace Piggie Rescue in Crawley in exchange for a donation. The owner of the rescue site handled the guinea pigs.'

The £9.99 Guinea Pig Games 2013 calendar is available now.
