Fancy a little ‘fox au vin’?  Or maybe some foxtail soup? Then Jamie Oliver’s restaurants could soon be the place for you.

The celebrity chef joked about putting foxes on the menu yesterday, after one killed his rare pet swan.

Writing on his Twitter page, the TV chef posted a picture of two cracked eggs laid by the female swan hours before it was attacked by a fox with the message: ‘So sad a massive fox killed my beautiful  black swan.’

Unusual pets: Chef Jamie Oliver and his wife Jools kept two rare-breed black swans at their Essex home - this year was the first time they'd mated

The message, which could be read by the star’s three million followers, continued: ‘Such a shame it was sitting on two eggs for the last month .  .  . Really sad, the fox didn’t even eat a thing, just tore up the mother – even worse I got it on CCTV.

‘Anyway nature has its cruel way but if you see fox on my menu soon don’t be surprised! Shame. Anyway, happy weekend guys, love to all.’

Oliver, 37, who has four children with his wife, former model Jools, has kept a pair of rare-breed black swans at his Essex farmhouse for several years. They are native to Australia and boast distinctive red beaks and black feathers.

A spokesman for the star, known for his Jamie’s Italian restaurants, said this was the first year the swans – which breed for life – had mated, producing two eggs last month which the female had been guarding. The spokesman added Oliver was incubating the eggs at home in a bid to save the unborn cygnets.
