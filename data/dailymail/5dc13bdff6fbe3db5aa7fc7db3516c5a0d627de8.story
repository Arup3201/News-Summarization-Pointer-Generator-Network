The Duchess of York has once again publicly stood by her ex-husband after appearing on The Rachael Ray Cooking show today. 

Sarah Ferguson, 55, appeared on American television and said that despite the fact that 'recent weeks have been pretty bad for the York family', they remain a 'unit'.

Her interview comes days after the Duchess appeared on the Today show and defended Prince Andrew following recent allegations.

The Prince's ex-wife slammed reports that he had sexual relations with an underage girl as 'salacious lies' and defended him as a 'humongously good man'.

In a passionate rebuttal on the show on Tuesday, the Duchess said that she was standing by 'my best friend and my best ex-husband ever' amid the allegations.

Buckingham Palace has issued a statement strongly denying the allegations against Prince Andrew which Sarah repeated during her interview.

She said the claims against her former husband - whom she called 'a great father and humongously good man' - were 'shockingly accusatory allegations which I don't think are right'. 

And speaking with Rachel Ray and her guest host, singer Donny Osmond, Sarah once again stressed the family's solidarity at this difficult time.

In the promotional clip of the taped interview, the Duchess is seen coming out from backstage in a tight fitting blue dress, pointing at the hosts enthusiastically and running over towards them.

Once sat down at the table, the trio begin discussing Sarah's family life. 

The Duchess of York said 24-year-old daughter Eugenie still sits on her lap, and thinks Donny Osmond is 'very cool'.

'I did actually try to sing Puppy Love,' she says.

'We call ourselves the tripod. Mummy, Beatrice and Eugenie. We're best friends, and then sometimes I'm mummy,' she continues.

'I'm very proud of my girls, they're extraordinarily courageous.

'They have their dad, whose a member of the royal family, then they have their bonkers mum. They have to balance.

'I think its really good that they're confident. I've always told them, "No-one wants to see a bad tempered princess, so if you go out in the sidewalk - smile. No matter what, smile. If you don't want to go out, don't go out."

'I think the recent weeks have been pretty bad for the York family but we remain a unit as we always do.

'I'm very proud of the way the girls carry on. They just carry on.

'I think Beatrice and Eugenie are the best ambassadors to good parenting.

'Andrew and I are the happiest divorced  couple in the world. Extraordianry, isn't it? We live in the same house. But then its a big house.' 

The pair, who divorced in 1996 after 10 years of marriage, remain good friends, she said. They have two daughters together, Beatrice, 26, and Eugenie.

Prince Andrew has come under fire over his past friendship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who has been accused in court documents of supplying the royal with an underage girl.

Virginia Roberts - now said to be a married mother-of-three in her 30s - alleges that between 1999 and 2002 she 'was forced to have sexual relations with this prince when she was a minor' in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein.

Others named in the lawsuit have also denied the claims. Attorney and former Harvard Law school professor Alan Dershowitz said the accusations were 'totally false and made up'.

The accusation, which is contained in a motion filed in Florida, is part of a lawsuit over how federal prosecutors handled Epstein's case. He was jailed for 18 months in 2008 for soliciting a minor for prostitution.

Two years after his 2009 release, Epstein was pictured in New York City with the prince, and their friendship was a source of controversy.

Buckingham Palace has issued a statement strongly denying the allegations, which the Duchess of York says are 'false and without any foundation'.
