Jose Mourinho was last night simmering on the subjects of ‘respect’ and ‘freedom’ after Chelsea’s attempts to move the title clash at Liverpool were flatly rejected.

Chelsea asked the Barclays Premier League, Sky TV and Liverpool if they would agree to hold the game today rather than tomorrow. While the broadcasters were said to be open to the idea, the Premier League ruled it out without consulting Liverpool.

Mourinho refused to retract his threat to rest players from the Anfield game, claiming Chelsea had not received the respect they deserved as England’s most successful European team of the last decade.

He also promised to help his rivals if the roles were reversed next year. ‘If next season Chelsea play an English team that is playing the Champions League semi-final two or three days later, Chelsea will accept to play the game one or two days before to give the English team more chance,’ he said. ‘We would be protecting English football without creating any problem for Chelsea.’

Mourinho’s ongoing dispute over  fixtures is, however, one of several  struggles with the authorities.

The Premier League are investigating his absence from some press conferences recently and he has until Monday to answer his third FA misconduct charge of the season, which relates to the sarcastic congratulations he offered to referee Mike Dean and referees’ chief Mike Riley after losing against Sunderland.

‘I can’t say the truth because I don’t feel free,’ said Mourinho, rekindling memories of the infamous ‘cuffed hands’ salute he aimed at the Italian FA during his time at Inter Milan. ‘I can’t speak. Every time I speak, there’s a consequence. Even when I think the referee is amazing, there’s a reason to be charged.’

The Chelsea boss stressed his priority would be Wednesday’s Champions League semi-final against Atletico Madrid. The tie is goalless after the first leg in Spain.

‘I can’t lose more players,’ he added. ‘You think if I lose one more player, I have any chance to play the final?

‘The most important thing for me is my club and the supporters. Chelsea fans would like Chelsea to get the respect Chelsea deserves.

‘They know what Chelsea has done for English football for the last 10 years.

‘Chelsea has been the most important club to defend this country in European competitions.

‘The last to be European champions, the last to win the Europa League, the club with the record of presence in semi-finals. Chelsea fans, they think Chelsea deserve more respect than they’re getting.

‘They want Chelsea to go to Liverpool and play, as always, at the maximum,  giving everything. With which players? That’s our decision, not your decision.

‘If we are not helped to try to follow our dreams and our objectives, it is one more reason for us to close, to think about us and only us.’

Mourinho has claimed all season that English teams are disadvantaged  in Europe because they cannot move games around at will like their rivals, and  dismissed the fact that, this week, Atletico will also play Sunday and Wednesday.

‘Luckily for us, they have no choice,’ he said. Atletico’s fixture happens to be against Valencia, who played in a Europa League semi-final on Thursday. Otherwise, Mourinho thinks that the game would have been played today.

He acknowledged the sweetener for  English clubs came in the form of millions of pounds from Sky TV rights but added: ‘Maybe, one day, for seven, eight, nine, 10 years you don’t have a European champion or a team in the semi-finals and the people who pay the big sums says: “Eh, the big teams, the most important teams in Europe aren’t here”.

Of the Liverpool game, he said: ‘We are going to try and win,’ but he has big  decisions in defence, where Tomas Kalas and Nathan Ake could be involved, and in goal, where he must choose between Mark Schwarzer and Henrique Hilario, who has not played for nearly three years. 

Selection will depend on the fitness of John Terry, Eden Hazard and Samuel Eto’o, all ruled out of the trip to Merseyside but who could be ready for Europe.

Ramires will not play at Anfield as he is banned for four games after flinging an arm into the face of Sunderland’s Seb Larsson.

‘He’s a lucky guy,’ said Mourinho changing the angle and making Ramires the victim. ‘In less than a minute, he was lucky [Lee] Cattermole didn’t break his leg, lucky that Larsson didn’t break his Achilles and lucky he only got four matches’ suspension. He’s a lucky guy.’

He declined to comment on Liverpool’s quest for their first title in 24 years and on the work of his friend Brendan Rodgers this year. These, he said, would be  delivered in private.

Nothing either on Daniel Sturridge sold by Chelsea last year or Luis Suarez, who Mourinho has dubbed the ‘King of the Penalties’ this season, other than a reminder to ‘check the stats’. Asked if he thought neutral fans were with Liverpool, he replied: ‘I’m not neutral, I’m Chelsea’ and asked if he thought Steven Gerrard deserved a winner’s medal, he replied: ‘Why? Many big players never won it.’

Despite his glum look, Mourinho insisted he had not lost his taste for English  football. ‘I love it, I love it,’ he said.

‘The fans, the stadiums, the yellow ball in winter, the white ball in summer, the FA Cup final with Hull City, the semi-finals with Sheffield United and Wigan.

‘All of this is English football and I love English football.’

His love for Chelsea burns strongly, too, he added, ridiculing the idea he might fancy a move to Manchester United.

‘I don’t know how someone could think about it,’ Mourinho said. ‘I left Real Madrid specifically to come to Chelsea. I signed a four-year contract. I told Chelsea they never have to worry about me because I don’t want to leave. I stay here until the club wants me to leave.’
