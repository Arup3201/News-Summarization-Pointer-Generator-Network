A woman has filmed a seductive film noir video featuring a nude model to advertise the Gold Coast property she is trying to sell.

When Jo Erskine put her Surfers Paradise property up for sale she decided she wanted to do more than just advertise it through traditional real estate channels.

Ms Erskine, who worked in the film industry for 28 years, came up with the idea for the short film with the help of Gold Coast filmmaker Brett Clements.

'He's done a couple like this to get people's attention,' Ms Erskine told Daily Mail Australia.

'I let him, I had to pull him back a couple of times and say 'Mate, it's about the house not the girl!'

'But I know where he's coming from. It seems to be working.'

The video showcases the two-bedroom house's interior and exterior with a moody black and white video featuring a blonde model smoking, showering and walking around the house in a black bralette and leather skirt.

She then walked upstairs to the second storey of the property which shots of the bedroom are cut with raunchy frames of the woman lying nude in bed.

Mr Clements, founder of PlatinumHD, took inspiration for the film noir style from the 24 Paradise Island property, which is filled with rolls of film, cameras and tripods.

'It was a smart move for it to be noticed,' Ms Erskine said.

'And from my point of view I think it's been the cultural art centre of Surfers Paradise – I have had so many artists, poets, opera singers and all sorts of people come through here.

'So I realised there's a lot of history in this house it just seems fitting to pay the tribute because on the Gold Coast they don't cherish history here they just knock it down and put something else in its place.'

Ms Erskine bought the property from George Milkins, who built the home in 1967 for his artist wife Marian Milkins with a large upstairs studio with high ceilings and 'magical' lighting.

Ms Erskine, who was forced to retire from the film industry due to a hand injury but who also works as an artist, said she was selling the property she's lived in for 25 years with a heavy heart.

'It's my little haven I create everything from this place - that's why it's a very emotional sale,' she said.

'It's not something I want to do I just can't manage it anymore.

'It's like a farm in Surfers Paradise, it's a big property. You could be anywhere in the world here it doesn't feel like you're the heart of Surfers Paradise.'

The 676sq m property, being sold by Ray White Mermaid Beach, also boasts 13m of ocean access waterfront, is walking distance to the beach and has an impressive garden.

'I have black swans that come to my place and the birds come for all the trees, it's like a sanctuary for them,' Ms Erskine said.

'There are jacarandas and a beautiful coconut palm with the best coconuts in the world, a mango tree, frangipani trees.'
