The controversy enveloping the Veterans Affairs department's health care division is actually a net positive for the country, says retired neurosurgeon and conservative commentator Ben Carson, because it has shown Americans the pitfalls of a government run healthcare system.

'I think what’s happening with the veterans is a gift from God to show us what happens when you take layers and layers of bureaucracy and place them between the patients and the health care provider,' Carson told Fox News on Saturday after an anchor asked him if the VA drama is a 'preview' of what is going to happen with Obamacare when it is fully implemented.

'And if we can’t get it right, with the relatively small number of veterans,' Carson continued, 'how in the world with are you going to do it with the entire population? You don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out.'

'I think what¿s happening with the veterans is a gift from God to show us what happens when you take layers and layers of bureaucracy and place them between the patients and the health care provider,' Dr. Ben Carson told Fox News on Saturday after an anchor asked him if the VA drama is a 'preview' of what is going to happen with Obamacare when it is fully implemented

Dr. Carson was catapulted to prominence after his keynote at the National Prayer Breakfast in 2013. During his speech, Carson, who is black, expressed criticism for a wide range of Obama administration policies, including the health care reform law, to president Barack Obama's face.

'Here’s my solution: when a person is born, give them a birth certificate, an electronic medical record, and a health savings account, to which money can be contributed pre-tax to the time you’re born to the time you die,' Carson proposed.

'When you die, you can pass it on to your family members so that when you’re 85 years old and you have six diseases, you’re not trying to spend up everything. You’re happy to send it on and there’s nobody talking about death panels.'

Carson's fiery profession of support for values consistent with conservatism immediately caught the attention of right-wing groups, and by the following day pundits and grassroots advocates were calling on Carson to run for president in 2016.

'If the Lord grabbed me by the collar and made me do it, I would,' Carson told Fox News host Sean Hannity the day after the breakfast.

Carson is now a contributor to Fox News and conservative newspaper The Washington Times and has only grown more vocal about his opposition to Obamacare.

'You know Obamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,' he told the very conservative attendees of the Family Research Council's Values Voter Summit in October.

'And it is in a way, it is slavery in a way, because it is making all of us subservient to the government, and it was never about health care. It was about control,' he said.

On Friday, Carson laid into the VA as 'a top heavy organization with a lot of bureaucracy that keeps things from happening.'

'We simply don’t need that kind of bureaucracy in virtually anything that we’re doing today,' Carson told a CBS Philadelphia radio host.

'We’re problem solvers - or at least we used to be very innovative people. That’s being depressed by the kinds of policies that we’ve put in place now. We need to unleash the potential of the American people.'

Carson, who chagrins at being labeled as a follower of any political ideology, chastised Republicans and Democrats on Saturday for playing politics with the health care of the nation's veterans.

'We need seriousness here rather than just political speak. ‘How can I look better? How can my party look better?’ Carson said. 'Let's stop, and think about the people.'

'You know, you guys are servants. You're not rulers,' he added. 'So first of all get that out of your mind, and think about what can we do with the problems we have to solve in this nation, which are substantial, some of which threaten to actually destroy or our nation - our fiscal irresponsibility. We can deal with these things.'

Carson said this week he's 'starting to feel' a calling to seek office because so people have asked him 'to do something.'

'I think I’m starting to hear something,' he told The Weekly Standard.

'It’s not something I want to do after a very arduous career in neurosurgery; I was looking for some relaxation in my life,' Carson told CBS.

'I don’t know if it’s so much me that they want as they want some common sense. Preferably somebody would come along who offered all those things, who engendered a lot of excitement and then I could get behind them and push them,' he said.

'But if it doesn’t happen than certainly, I would have to consider it,' he added.

Carson would be well-funded if he does decide to run.

In the first three months of 2014 alone, the National Draft Ben Carson Committee raised close to $2.4 million. By comparsion, the Ready for Hillary political action committee raised significantly less money than Carson's fans did.

The National Draft Ben Carson Committee has already spent all of the money it raised, but its ability to elicit so much money in donations on Carson's behalf a year and a half out from a figurative presidential campaign is impressive.

Say the magic words, and Dr. Carson could go from dark horse presidential candidate to serious competitior overnight.
