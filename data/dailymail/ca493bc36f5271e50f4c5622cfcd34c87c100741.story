Crystal Palace caretaker manager Keith Millen is unsure whether he or Alan Pardew will take charge of the New Year's Day trip to Aston Villa.

Palace agreed a £2million compensation package with Newcastle United to take Pardew back to the club where he played from 1987 to 1991.

But the deal has not yet been confirmed and Millen is preparing the Palace squad assuming he will be in charge of the away dugout at Villa Park.

All was quiet at Crystal Palace's Beckenham training on Tuesday, with no Pardew announcement imminent

'I am planning on picking the team against Villa,' Millen told a press conference on Tuesday, 'I said to the chairman that I can do the job [permanently] but he has been busy talking to Newcastle.'

He added: 'We will be ready for the Villa game - whoever is in charge.'

Millen, who is in his third caretaker stint at Selhurst Park since joining the club in November 2012, revealed he is unsure whether Pardew will keep him on the backroom staff.

He said: 'I don't know that will be Alan's decision. I would be happy to work with the football club, depending on my role.'

Asked if he was surprised by Pardew's decision to leave St James' Park, Millen said: 'I wasn't surprised. Alan has played for this club, he has a lot of fond memories. It means a lot to him.

'Palace is a good job for someone. The chairman wants to build on the success we have had.'

Reflecting on Neil Warnock's time as Palace manager, Millen said: 'It would be difficult for whoever came in after Tony Pulis.'

Pulis guided Palace to an 11th-placed finish in May but they are currently in the relegation zone.
