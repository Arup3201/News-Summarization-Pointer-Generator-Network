According to Stinson's account, the vile acts are pranks.'All of this is jokes,' he commented on one of his videos. 'I’m not out here really robbing people. I’m not out here really shooting people. I could be doing that. That’s the s*** I’m trying to leave behind.'Other not-so-funny posts on his Instagram account include racism, sexism and fooling people into thinking he's hurt himself then screaming in their faces when they try to help him.

Stinson's father is just one of many who are unamused by his 'jokes.''He considers it funny,' Rodney Stinson told NBC Philadelphia. 'He does a lot of other things. Nothing with the gun is funny. Nothing. I don't consider it funny.'

According to The Smoking Gun, he is held on $125,000 bail in Philadephia Police's Central Detective Division.
