Carlo Ancelotti says Luis Suarez is a 'fantastic' player and refused to rule out a move for Liverpool's star striker this summer.

Real Madrid have been linked with a big-money move for the Uruguay hitman and Ancelotti says that Madrid will wait until after the World Cup to do any prospective business.

Karim Benzema impressed this season for Madrid but there is a clamour in Spain's capital for Real to improve by purchasing the 27-year-old Premier League Golden Boot winner.

'It is difficult to improve what we have,' said Ancelotti. 'Luis Suarez is a fantastic player, but it is disrespectful to talk about a transfer now.'

He added: 'We're in no rush and we don't need to bring in a lot of players. We have until August 31.'

Suarez has been a long-term target for Real Madrid but the Champions League winners would have to dig deep to afford the Liverpool forward.

A figure of around £72million has been touted for the 'galactico' whom Florentino Perez wants to bestow upon Ancelotti, to help Madrid improve on last season's third-place La Liga finish. 

Suarez agitated for a move last summer but eventually agreed to stay at Liverpool and helped them come close to the Premier League title.

Meanwhile, the Italian, speaking at the presentation of his new website, gave Arsenal good and bad news about two of their summer transfer targets.

Ancelotti says that goalkeeper Iker Casillas wants to stay at the club but striker Alvaro Morata will be allowed to leave.

Gunners boss Arsene Wenger wants to add both Spaniards to Arsenal's squad.

After Lukasz Fabianski signed for Swansea on a four-year deal, the only first-team goalkeeper left at the Emirates is Wojciech Szczesny. 

Wenger hoped to persuade Casillas, who was only selected in cup competitions for Madrid last season with Diego Lopez preferred in La Liga, to switch to north London.

But Ancelotti said: 'Casillas is very happy to stay here and we are very happy that he wants to stay.'When asked about who would be first choice next season Ancelotti said he had not made up his mind. 

'We have not thought about this after the victory [in the Champions League final] because everybody went on holiday.'

On Morata though, the signs are positive for Arsenal.

Ancelotti explained: 'The player wants to look for an opportunity where he can play more and the club agrees with this.

'If he leaves it would be good that he would have the chance to play. If Morata goes we have to think about getting a young forward with the same characteristics.'
