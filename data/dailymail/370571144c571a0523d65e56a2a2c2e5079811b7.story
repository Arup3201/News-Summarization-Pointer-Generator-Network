Fearne Cotton has come under fire from campaigners after playing the catchphrase of her paedophile ex-boyfriend Ian Watkins in a jingle on her radio show.

The Radio 1 star played a jingle promoting the station with the phrase 'mega lolz' during her show on Monday morning.

The slang phrase - short for 'laugh out loud' - hit the headlines last month when it emerged that jailed rock star Watkins had used it to make light of his vile crimes, which included the attempted rape of a baby.

Slogan: Watkins used 'mega lolz' as a catchphrase for his band Lostprophets, printing it on a range of T-shirts

Children's campaigners criticised the BBC for allowing the phrase to be broadcast to an audience of millions, saying it could be 'highly distressing' to those listening.

The jingle advertises Radio 1 and includes DJs and listeners talking about why they like the station.

After pleading guilty to 13 child sex offences, Lostprophets singer Watkins, 36, sent a message to a fan joking about the offences.

'I am going to put a statement out just to say it was mega lolz,' he said. 'I don't know what everyone is getting so freaked out about.'

Ex: Miss Cotton has been criticised for using the phrase associated with her former lover Watkins

The former rock star, who dated Ms Cotton in 2005, was sentenced to 29 years in prison and another six years on licence.

Two women who allowed Watkins to abuse their young children were also jailed alongside him.

Lostprophets had previously used 'mega lolz' as a slogan, performing in front of a huge backgroup painted with the words.

Watkins also designed T-shirts sporting the phrase - which fans snapped up after his imprisonment in a twisted tribute to the singer.

Last week, he launched an appeal against his sentence, using taxpayer-funded legal aid to pay for his court bid.

Sara Payne, a leading campaigner for 
children's protection, told The Sun: 'It will be highly distressing for 
anyone preyed upon by Watkins to hear these words used light-heartedly 
on morning radio.

'After what happened with the Jimmy Savile scandal, the BBC should know better.'

A spokesman for the BBC said: 'The term is a commonly used colloquialism amongst young people and the trail reflected this.'

Miss Cotton, 32, a former children's TV presenter who has fronted the Radio 1 morning show since 2009, was last month forced to apologise after accidentally broadcasting swearing via an open microphone.
