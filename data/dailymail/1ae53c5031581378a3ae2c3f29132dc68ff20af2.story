Father: Marc Traylor, 40, was fighting for his life in hospital today after being shot by police in Kent

A 40-year-old father was fighting for his life in hospital today after being shot by police after his teenage daughter was stabbed.

Police firearms officers and negotiators went to the home in Hersden, Kent, late last night and laid siege to the property in a stand-off that ended with Marc Traylor being shot.

The daughter  was also in a critical condition this afternoon after being stabbed during the stand-off in the village - and two knives have since been recovered from the scene.

Retired fireman Peter Johnson, 54, who lives opposite the house where the shooting happened, said that a dramatic two-hour period last night began with the sound of a huge crash.

He told MailOnline today: 'I went to bed, and probably about half an hour after I heard something make a noise almost like a car had hit something - then a bit of a commotion.

‘The lady opposite who was involved was standing by her gate. Approximately ten minutes later the police turned up – with about ten police vehicles. When they turned up I thought “what’s going on”?

‘They went in, did their bit - and about half an hour more vehicles turned up including armed response. They went in and about 20 minutes after that there was a few shots.

‘Police came out onto the road shouting for the ambulance to come quickly. About five minutes after that they brought a young lady out and carried her up towards the ambulance

‘Another half an hour later they brought the man out on a stretcher. After that, it looked like it was all over, but they’re still outside - they’ve got forensics there.’

He said he did not know the man or woman at the property, as they generally did not speak to other neighbours – in contrast to most other people on the road.

And Ruby Miller, 21, who lives opposite the house, told Kent Online: ‘I looked out of my window at about 11.15pm and saw about 20 officers piling in to the house. No one's telling us anything.’

Kent Police said that the matter had been sent to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) for investigation.

A police spokesman said: ‘At 11.20pm on Sunday, Kent Police received a call to attend an incident in Hersden. Local officers initially attended, followed by firearms officers and police negotiators.

‘A young woman inside the house received stab wounds and a 40-year-old man was shot by a police officer. The man was taken to hospital where he is in a critical condition.

‘The young woman is also in hospital in a critical condition. They are members of the same family.

‘As this is a police shooting, the matter has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which is mandatory.’

A spokesman for the force on Twitter added: ‘We dealt with an incident in Hersden overnight that has now been resolved. There was no threat to public safety.’

A police patrol van and forensic investigation vehicle were both parked outside the house today.

An IPCC spokesman said: ‘We have had the matter referred to us and have started an independent investigation.’

The incident happened on The Avenue, a road with an average house value of £175,000 which lies almost five miles north-east of the nearest city, Canterbury.
