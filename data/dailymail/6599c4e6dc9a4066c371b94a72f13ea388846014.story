He's an international DJ who has played gigs all over the world. But only now that his father, the former French President Nicholas Sarkozy, has left the Elysee Palace does his son Pierre feel he can ply his trade in his home country.

Last week, with gigs in Ibiza, Sao Paulo and Kiev under his belt, Pierre Sarkozy, known by his DJ name Mosey, played a gig to a crowd at Queen on the Champs-Elysées.

'It was so emotional,' he said in an interview with Mr Porter's online journal. 'I was nervous at the beginning because it was my hometown and in front of so many people. But once I started to play it was all pleasure.'

Ambition: Pierre said he wanted to prove himself as a DJ overseas before playing in his home country

Pierre says he had never wanted to play in France while his father, who is married to the supermodel  Carla Bruni, was President. 'I didn't want that to be the big issue,' he said. 'I wanted to prove my value outside of France first.

'Now I can play in France because I've showed people that I'm good at what I do, and not because of who I am.'

Fresh from his successful homecoming, Pierre is proving he has other talents too - namely as a very successful clothes horse for luxury menswear brand Mr Porter.

The 26-year-old is modelling the latest collection to land on the online store, and is pictured strolling around Paris wearing a selection of Yves Saint Laurent, Lanvin, Jil Sander, Dolce and Gabbana and Gucci pieces as if he was born to it.

Fashion
savvy: Style should be a way to express yourself, but not something 
that you're devoted to,' he says. 'It's like what we say about money: 
It's a good servant, but a bad master'

Street smart: Pierre says his usual style is a laidback mix of jeans with vintage T-shirts and trainers

Wise beyond his years, and with a personal aesthetic to match, Pierre says his style is inspired by some surprising influences - namely Michael J Fox and Johnny Depp.

'Michael J Fox in Back to the Future is my style icon,' he says. 'And Johnny Depp in 21 Jump Street.'

'I still have the pump-up sneakers that Michael J Fox wears. They're hard to find, but I have many pairs of pump-ups.'

Pierre says he pairs his sneakers with jeans and T-shirts, which he sources from a T-shirt shop in the 8th arrondissement of Paris - which he says will remain his secret.

'I'd like to grow up one day, but I'm still into the jeans and the sneakers,' he says.

Despite his penchant for the dressed down though, Pierre has a refined sense of the power of a good wardrobe. 

'I've always thought style should be a way to express yourself, but not something that you're devoted to,' he says.

'It's like what we say about money: It's a good servant, but a bad master.'
