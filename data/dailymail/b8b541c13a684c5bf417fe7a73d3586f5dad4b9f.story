Chinatown is the bustling heart of downtown Manhattan and with an estimated population of 100,000 literally piled on top of each other in century old tenements, it is also the most crowded.

Bordered by the every-shrinking Little Italy and the fabulously wealthy Tribeca and SoHo neighborhoods, Chinatown is a throwback to the cramped, wilder days of New York City at the turn of the 20th century.

Rootless members of the Chinese diaspora make their way to the Big Apple to find work in the bustling metropolis, but with little money, no job protection and no guaranteed income, the invisible workforce finds accommodation where they can.

Cramped: One of the last lodging houses in New York City, 81 Bowery was home for a generation of immigrant Chinese laborers who work at construction sites and kitchens in Chinatown. Last March, dozens of individuals sharing the fourth-floor - each occupying a 64-square-foot cubicle - were evicted

Photographer Annie Ling has spent the past four years documenting the different aspects of life in Chinatown, observing family life and those less fortunate who struggle inside rent-regulated Single Room Occupancy (SRO) buildings such as the legendary 81 Bowery.

Cramped into one floor on one building on the infamous Manhattan thoroughfare photographer Jacob Riis called the 'great democratic highway of the city', 81 Bowery provided Ling with a glimpse of the reality of life in Chinatown.

Before it was dramatically shut-down in a flurry of controversy in March 2013, the SROs of 81 Bowery provided cubicles on average 64 square foot from $200 a month, or $9 a month - cash in hand.

Searing New York heat: Often on hot summer nights, residents relaxed and took naps on the fire escape to cool down

Exit is that way: The residents found themselves evicted on one night by the City of New York in March 2013

There, like a modern-day Riis, Ling found dozens of people, mostly immigrants, aged anywhere from 18 to 88-years-old, crammed into small rooms, sharing bathrooms.

However, for the proud people who called it home, there was no shame.

Indeed, some had lived there and other such SRO buildings in Chinatown for nearly three decades.

They would cook together, watch Chinese opera on television together and lend money to each other in support of their attempt at the American Dream.

Annie Ling's project is entitled 'A Floating Population' and went on display as part of an exhibition that explores, 'the connection between people and lived spaces within this neighborhood' at The Museum of Chinese in America (MOCA) in New York.

Mr. Chu, an immigrant laborer from China, once lived in cubicle #4 in 81 Bowery. Like many immigrant laborers, he lives on very little and sends most of his earnings back to his wife and children back in China

The March eviction was not popular in the city, especially when it was revealed the complaint that sparked it came from someone in Arizona, after they watched  CNN piece on 81 Bowery.

Resident, Chen Xiukang, 62, was despondent on losing his home.

'We were like a family,' said Chen Xiukang, 62, a cook at a Chinese restaurant to The New York Times. 'We help each other. We rely on one another.'

In the aftermath, the city tried to help those who could prove legal documents that they were residents help in the form of temporary housing.

Simple: The hallways on the fourth floor of 81 Bowery was a place where its residents shared stories, dried their laundry and played card games

Sad: Some of the elderly who resided at 81 Bowery, have no options. They live there, because it¿s what they can afford

The others were left to ask friends and relatives for help.

The Committee Against Anti-Asian Violence (CAAAV), is still trying to rehome some of those turfed-out and briefly led a campaign to reopen 81 Bowery, which ultimately failed.

Asked why a housing situation that would seem unpalatable to most New Yorkers is being so fiercely fought over, Ling said that for some, it is all they have.

'They struggle to operate outside of Chinatown because of language and cultural barriers,' she says.

Indeed, for Ling, this project is personal. Her Chinatown tenement burned down in 2008, leaving her homeless for a year and her photographs have helped illuminate an oft-ignored situation.
