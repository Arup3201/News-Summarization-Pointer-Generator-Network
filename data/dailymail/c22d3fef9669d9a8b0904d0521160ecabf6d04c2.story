The former girlfriend of billionaire George Soros hit the philanthropist in the head and knocked the glasses clean off his lawyer's face during a deposition for her $50 million lawsuit against him, according to papers filed in Manhattan today.

Adriana Ferreyr, 30, became irate during Tuesday's hearing, physically attacking Soros and his lawyer Martin Singer and verbally abusing another lawyer, William Zabel, before turning her wrath on her own attorney William Beslow, according to Singer.

The Brazilian soap actress is suing 83-year-old Soros for allegedly breaking his promise to buy her a $1.9 million Manhattan apartment.

The $50 million suit was launched in 2011 after Soros gifted the apartment to his now-wife Tamika Bolton, 42.

Papers filed by Singer on Friday say Ferreyr screamed that Soros was a 'f***ing a**hole,' before lunging at him 'suddenly and without warning,' reports Page Six.

She struck the octogenarian on the head, knocking off the headphones he was wearing to amplify the audio before she was restrained by Singer, according to the papers.

'I let go of her arms. Ms. Ferreyr immediately swung at my face, knocking off my glasses. She then moved toward my glasses that had landed on the floor as if she were going to jump on them,' Singer alleges.

'I again grabbed her arms and moved her away from my glasses. After I let go of her arms, she resumed swinging at me and attempted to kick me.'

Another aide who stepped in to help, Jose Santos, received a slap across the face and a kick in the shins from Ferreyr for his efforts, claims Singer.

Ferreyr's outburst occurred after she arrived at the deposition with a cameraman only to be told she was not permitted to film Soros' deposition.

According to the New York Daily News, Singer and Ferreyr's attorney Beslow agreed that Soros' deposition would not be filmed, provoking Ferreyr to hit Beslow in the arm and storm out of the room.

'You piece of s***!' she screamed at Soros as he passed her in the hallway, according to the court papers.

After Ferreyr tried to film on her mobile phone and proceedings were again interrupted, the lawyers agreed to break for lunch.

According to another attorney for Soros, the enraged Brazilian told Soros attorney Zabel, 'You're gonna go down, Zabel. You're gonna go down. You should go to prison and get beat up,' reports the Daily News.

Ferreyer and Soros dated for five years up until 2011.

Ferreyr said she was monogamous during their time together, and was hoping to 'settle down' with Soros, who she said never lavished her with money or gifts during their first few years together.

Eventually, however, she said he offered to buy her an apartment. And she found her 'dream home' - a $1.9 million condo at 30 East 85th St - just two streets from him.

'I did a lot of research on it. I made sure it was a good investment. I explained to him what good a deal it was, why I loved it, why it would be a great place to live... He told me, "I am going to buy it. I am going to do this for you, "' she said.

But Ferreyr claims the day after they signed off on the paperwork, Soros had a change of heart, and offered the apartment to 39-year-old Tamiko Bolton, described as his 'traveling nurse' at the time.

'We were in bed, and he just replied coldly and bluntly that he had given (the apartment) to his other girlfriend. I got emotional and cried... He just said, "I don't care." I was in bed with him. It was horrifying for me,' Ferreyr said.

The soap star has also claimed that Soros slapped her in the face and attempted to choke her as they argued over the property in bed together.

She claims their confrontation traumatized her to the point she was ‘unable to function in her day-to-day life’ and that she has since had to have treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.

Ferreyr is suing for 'intentional infliction of emotional distress.'

William Zabel, Soros’s lawyer, called the suit ‘frivolous and entirely without merit’.

Although he admitted his client had an ‘on-again, off-again’ relationship with Ferreyr, he said the complaint was ‘riddled with false charges and is obviously an attempt to extract money from my client, who is known to be a very rich man’.

Soros and Bolton were married in September last year, in her second and his third marriage.
