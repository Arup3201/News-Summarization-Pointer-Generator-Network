A mother desperate to lose weight in time for her 40th has celebrated her 5st weight loss and landmark birthday with a lingerie shoot.

Lorraine Merrett, who weighed 15st, wore size 20 clothes and was embarrassed by her 40FF boobs, was inspired to shift the pounds by Birds of a Feather star Pauline Quirke.

Speaking about her weight loss, Lorraine said: 'I thought if Pauline could so it then so can I - she was my inspiration.

Comedy actress Pauline, 52, was almost 
20st when she started on Lighterlife and slimmed down to her target 
weight of 11st.

'Everyone thought of her as a naturally big woman - and that is what people thought of me. But I saw how Pauline lost all her weight and decided I could do the same.'

Lorraine had gained weight after years of eating unhealthy takeaways and fry-ups.

She said: 'My husband Andy loved me being cuddly - he was quite happy being married to a big lady.

'But I didn't want to be big anymore and with my 40th birthday coming up I knew it was time.'

Before: Lorraine previously weighed 15st and wore size 20 clothes. She was struggling to lose weight in time for her 40th birthday when she read about Birds of a Feather Pauline slimming down

Is that really me? Lorraine, who is now her dream weight of 9st 6lb, was shocked by the photos and thought they'd been airbrushed

5ft 4in Lorraine joined slimming programme Lighterlife and swapped greasy food for low-calorie milkshakes, complemented by a new exercise regime.

Lorraine, from Oxford, reached her perfect weight of 9st 6lb five months later.

The mother-of-two said: 'My body had changed shape totally. The weight just fell off and I slimmed down to a slinky size 10. My boobs had lost ten inches too!

'I owe it to Pauline Quirke and Lighterlife - we are like birds of a feather when it comes to losing weight.'

Lorraine's husband Andy was so proud he booked a boudoir photoshoot for her 40th birthday.

Lorraine said: 'Part of me was thrilled and I wanted to do it for Andy because he's supported me throughout the diet. But it was nerve wracking and I cancelled the first session because I was too nervous to strip off.

'Eventually I plucked up the courage. I stripped down to my red and black lace underwear and suddenly felt a natural in front of the camera.

Changed woman: The mother-of-two said: 'My body had changed shape totally. The weight just fell off and I had shrunk to a slinky size 10. My boobs had lost ten inches too!'

'The photographer was very encouraging and kept reassuring me saying I looked great.

'When the pictures finally arrived I was amazed it was really me. Andy couldn't take his eyes off them.

'I had to admit they were so good I thought they had been airbrushed!'

Lorraine has had some of the pictures framed to put on the walls of her home in Oxford.

Proud husband Andy said: 'She looks fantastic.'
