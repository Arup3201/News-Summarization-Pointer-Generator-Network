Luis Suarez's physio postponed his own cancer treatment to ensure the Uruguay striker was fit for his destruction of England.

Walter Ferreira, 63, was due to have treatment before the World Cup. His decision to cancel it paid off on Thursday as Suarez’s brace sank England.

Deadly: Suarez almost singlehandedly downed England

Suarez, who rushed over to Ferreira after giving Uruguay a first-half lead, had worked with the physio after knee surgery four weeks ago.

Ferreira said:  ‘I am grateful the coaching staff had the confidence to send Luis to work with me.’

Suarez paid tribute to Ferreira for getting him fit in time for the crunch clash that sent England heading towards the exit.

He said: 'There are people who know how crucial it was for me to have their support. If it wasn't for him (Ferreira) I would not have been here.

'I cried a lot with him, because it was such a hard time, and complicated because of what he was living through as well, he made a sacrifice to remain with me the whole time.'
