Swapping stockings for kisses and teaching girls how to jive, American GIs were meant to be a welcome ray of sunshine in war-torn Europe.

But a new book has revealed the dark side of Europe’s liberation after the Second World War.

Professor Mary Louise Roberts, from the University of Wisconsin, said within months of D-Day ordinary French women came to fear their American ‘liberators’.

She tells how, by the summer of 1944, large numbers of women in Normandy filed complaints about rapes by US soldiers.

And their arrival prompted a wave of 
crime all over France, with American soldiers caught committing 
robberies and petty thefts.

Professor Roberts said: ‘My book 
seeks to debunk an old myth about the GI, thought of as a manly creature
 that always behaved well. The GIs were having sex anywhere and 
everywhere.

‘In the cities of Le Havre and Cherbourg, bad behaviour was common.

‘Women, including those who were 
married, were openly solicited for sex. Parks, bombed-out buildings, 
cemeteries and railway tracks were carnal venues.

‘People could not go out for a walk without seeing somebody having sex.

‘But the sex was not always consensual, with hundreds of cases of rape being reported.’

The locals of Le Havre were shocked by the soldiers’ behaviour and wrote letters of protest to their mayor.

One complaint, from October 1945, said: ‘We are attacked, robbed, run over both on the street and in our houses.

The book, which was released in June, focuses specifically on the soldiers of World War II and their interaction with the French people, but problems of sexual assault in the military persist to today, though now the victims are those in uniform as well.

The Pentagon is reeling from a series of sex-related scandals in recent weeks, including cases in which military advocates for victims of sexual assault were themselves accused of sex crimes.

Figures from the Department of Defense show a 37 per cent increase in reports of unwanted sexual contact, from groping to rape, last year. About 26,000 cases were reported in 2012.

'Sexual harassment and sexual assault in the military are a profound betrayal - a profound betrayal - of sacred oaths and sacred trusts,' Mr Hagel said. 'This scourge must be stamped out.'

His comments came a day after President Barack Obama delivered a similar message to graduates at the U.S. Naval Academy in Maryland, saying sexual assault threatened to erode trust and discipline in America's armed forces.

‘This is a regime of terror, imposed by bandits in uniform.’

Le Havre’s mayor, Pierre Voisin, complained to Colonel Thomas Weed – the commander of US troops in the region.

‘Scenes contrary to decency are 
unfolding in this city day and night,’ Voisin wrote, adding it was ‘not 
only scandalous but intolerable’ that ‘youthful eyes are exposed to such
 public spectacles’.

The mayor suggested the Americans set
 up a brothel outside the city to avoid public outrage and contain the 
spread of sexually transmitted diseases. However although US officers 
publicly denounced the behaviour they did little to curtail it.

The book also claims the US army 
‘demonstrated a deep and abiding racism’, suggesting they pinned a 
disproportionate number of rapes on black GIs.

Documents show that of 152 troops disciplined by the army for rape, 130 were black.

Professor Roberts said: ‘American 
propaganda did not sell the war to soldiers as a struggle for freedom 
but as a sexual adventure.’

She points out that The Stars and 
Stripes, the official newspaper of the US armed forces, taught soldiers 
German phrases like ‘waffen niederlegen’ meaning ‘throw down your arms’.

However the French phrases it 
recommended to soldiers included ‘you have charming eyes,’ ‘I am not 
married’ and ‘are your parents at home?’ US magazine Life even 
fantasised that France was ‘a tremendous brothel’ inhabited by 
‘40,000,000 hedonists, who spend all their time eating, drinking and 
making love’.

A cafe owner from Le Havre said at 
the time: ‘We expected friends who would not make us ashamed of our 
defeat. Instead, there came only incomprehension, arrogance, incredibly 
bad manners and the swagger of conquerors.’

The author claims that when the first soldiers swarmed ashore at Omaha Beach in Normandy (pictured) on D-Day, it was 'a veritable tsunami of male lust'

Controversial: Mary Louise Roberts wrote the book to uncover the reality about some GI soldiers

Controversial: Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto said that soldiers used 'comfort women' as ways to release tension during WWII

The book comes just one day after a Japanese politician sparked an international row after claiming the use of sex slaves during WWII was justified has tried to shift the blame by accusing other country's of using the same practice.

Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto, co-leader of an emerging nationalist party, argued Japan's wartime practice of forcing Asian women into prostitution was necessary to maintain military discipline and provide relaxation for soldiers.

But following the public outcry over his comments, the mayor has attempted to deflect criticism by accusing America and Britain of using sex slaves for its own soldiers.

He said: 'It is a hard truth that even these nations used local women for sexual reasons. This is a historical fact and there is hard evidence that proves it was true.'

Historians say up to 200,000 women, mainly from the Korean Peninsula and China, were forced to provide sex for Japanese soldiers in military brothels. While some other World War II armies had military brothels, Japan is the only country accused of such widespread, organized sexual slavery.
