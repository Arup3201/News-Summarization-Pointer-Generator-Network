The leader of the Greek church has warned rising poverty in the country caused by budget cuts could trigger a 'social explosion'.

The government's cost-cutting reforms were creating deprivation not seen since the Second World War, Orthodox church leader Ieronymos wrote to Prime Minister Lucas Papademo.

His warning came as German Premier Angela Merkel visited China where she sough to give reassurances over the debt crisis in Europe.

'Homelessness and even hunger have reached nightmare proportions,'Â  said the Greek religious leader.

'Patience among Greeks is running out, giving way to a sense of anger, and the danger of a social explosion cannot be ignored any longer.'

He added: 'The medicine we are taking has proved fatal for the nation. More painful, and more unjust measures are now set to follow along the same, hopeless course.'

Greece is promising rescue creditors tougher austerity measures as it nears agreement for a second bailout worth 130bn euros with its partners in the 17-nation eurozone and the IMF, and a related deal with private creditors that will see 100bn euros wiped off the national debt.

Without those agreements, Greece faces bankruptcy next month as it is unable to cover a 14.5bn bond repayment due on March 20.

Under pressure from the government and rescue creditors, leaders of Greece's unions and employers resumed talks to slash labor costs in the private sector.

Debt inspectors from the EU, IMF and European Central Bank - know as the troika - are currently visiting Athens, and insist the cuts are needed to boost Greece's sluggish competitiveness.

'This is a very difficult negotiation and of course there are differences of opinion, so we will see where that leads,' Greece's government spokesman Pantelis Kapsis told private Mega television.

'As a country, we have reached the brink of official bankruptcy. We have been borrowing for so many years and now we have our backs to the wall, so we have difficult decisions to make.'

The Greek church has stepped up a charity drive this week, during a cold snap that left much of the country in sub-freezing temperatures and a growing number of homeless people at risk.

Europe needs to double the size of its bailout fund to 1trillion euros if it is to shore up its banking system and stop the spread of its spiraling debt crisis, according to a paper published today by the economic organisation that represents developed countries.

The paper, written by Adrian Blundell-Wignall, who is the special adviser to the secretary-general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, laid out a list of steps Europe has to take 'if a fracturing of the euro is to be avoided.'

It includes making sure banks have enough money to weather the storm and forcing them to reduce their holdings of risky assets; making the banking system more secure by separating retail banking - the practice of lending to customers - from investment banking - a riskier business that involves making bets on investments; forcing Greece's private bondholders to take at least a 50 per cent loss on the debt; and increasing the size of the bailout fund, which will have 500bn euros when it comes into effect later this year.

The list is not new - many analysts have suggested similar remedies - but it comes from a respected source and added to the pressure on European governments to act.

European countries are already trying to shore up their banking system, and though they have long been reluctant to expand their bailout fund, that looks to be changing.

Unemployment in Greece has surged to 19.2 per cent, with the jobless rate for people under age 25 at 47.2 per cent, according to figures for October from the EU statistics agency, Eurostat.

Also today, workers from the state-run national health service gathered in protest outside the Health Ministry to protest spending cuts in health care, including a new round of wage reductions which took effect on February 1.

One group of protesters carried an empty coffin outside the central Athens building.

Meanwhile, China's premier said today that Beijing might contribute to European bailout funds during a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Merkel was on a visit to reassure Beijing about Europe's financial health following agreement this week on a European treaty on government spending that its leaders hope will end their debt crisis and revive economic growth.

Premier Wen Jiabao, China's top economic official, repeated pledges of support for Europe, his country's biggest trading partner, but made no financial commitments.

'It is very urgent and important to resolve Europe's debt crisis,' he said during a joint appearance with Merkel.

'China is considering greater involvement in resolving Europe's debt crisis by participating in the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Stability Mechanism.'

European leaders want China, with $3.2 trillion in foreign reserves, and other global investors to contribute to expanding the EFSF and the 500 billion euro ($650 billion) ESM, due to begin operation in July.

Merkel is the first of several European leaders to visit China this month for talks expected largely to focus on the economic crisis.

Europe is China's biggest export market and Beijing's stake in its financial health is growing as Chinese companies expand there.

China's biggest producer of construction equipment announced this week that it was buying Germany's Putzmeister, a maker of concrete pumps.'Whether we can maintain the stability of the financial system and stable economic growth and facilitate integration not only concerns the future of Europe but also has a great impact on China,'

Wen said. 'China supports Europe in safeguarding the stability of the euro.'
