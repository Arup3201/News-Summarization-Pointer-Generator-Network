The parents of a British woman who went missing from a Disney cruise liner are suing the company for $75,000 (£45,000).

Rebecca - known to her family as 'Bex' - Coriam, 24, vanished from the Disney Wonder three years ago as the ship sailed off the coast of Mexico.

It is thought Miss Coriam, who was a 
youth worker on the vessel, may have fallen overboard but her parents 
Mike and Ann Coriam, from Chester, have struggled to get answers about 
her disappearance.

And they have now have filed court papers in the US against Disney claiming the entertainment giant was negligent and failed in its duty of care.

Miss Coriam’s parents claim that Disney had no appropriate surveillance equipment on board the ship, no man overboard monitors and that emergency protocols were not followed.

It’s alleged that it took more than three hours for the company to check CCTV footage, more than four hours to alert the US Coast Guard, more than five hours to contact the Mexican navy and nearly seven hours to call police.

Although it was estimated that Miss Coriam could have survived in the sea for 14 hours, the ship kept on going and never turned back to search for her.

Mrs Coriam, 54, said: ‘Why would they not turn around? If it was their daughter would they have done?

‘We watched that ship sail out on the next cruise full of people laughing and cheering, playing the tune ‘When You Wish Upon A Star’, and our daughter was gone.’

She added: ‘No matter how powerful [Disney] are, people need to know what happened to us.’

Disney say there’s no ‘merit’ in the legal action.

Miss Coriam was last seen making a phone call to a friend from the staff quarters and the alarm was raised four hours later when she failed to turn up for the start of her shift.

An investigation by police in the Bahamas, where they ship was registered, found no evidence of foul play.

A spokesman for Disney Cruise Lines said: ‘This incident has been investigated by the authorities. The claims are without merit, as we will demonstrate in court.’

The company have until April to respond to the court papers when a judge will decide whether the case can be heard.
