Americans again named former First Lady Hillary Clinton as the woman they admire most in the world and sitting President Barack Obama as the most admired man in a repeat of last year's winners.

Clinton has taken the top spot among women for the last 13 consecutive years, and Obama has topped the list of men for the last seven.

Neither were as popular in Gallup's annual survey as they were last year, but they still managed to edge out other notable figures with 12 percent and 19 percent of the vote totals, respectively.

Also making an appearance on this year's list were Princess Kate and potential Clinton presidential rival Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts and progressive icon.

The Duchess of Cambridge received just two percent of the vote, but she was still the favorite of more Americans than Warren and former First Lady Laura Bush, both of whom were mentioned by just one percent of Americans polled.

Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and actress Angelina Jolie were also acknowledged by two percent of respondents. Current First Lady Michelle Obama did only slightly better, claiming three percent of the vote. 

Nabbing the top spots after Clinton were talk show host Oprah Winfrey (eight percent), women's rights activist Malala Yousafzai (five percent) and former Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice (four percent).

Clinton, a probable 2016 presidential candidate, has long been admired by most Americans, beating out her competition in the last 17 out of 18 years and earning the distinction a total of 19 times beginning in 1993 during her husband's first year in the Oval Office. 

The last time she was dethroned was in 2001 when then-First Lady Laura Bush claimed first place three months after the September 11 terrorist attacks. 

Clinton holds Gallup's record as the most-admired woman ever, having been ranked No. 1 more times than any other woman since the polling company began conducting the annual survey seven decades ago. 

In terms of total number of appearances on the top 10 list, however, Clinton comes in fifth with 23 showings. Outdoing her are Queen Elizabeth II with 46, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 34, former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis with 28 and Oprah Winfrey with 27.

Princess Kate was named as one of the top 10 most admired women in the world by Americans this year. Her husband, William, the future king of England, didn't break one percent of the vote

President Obama has made the list every year since he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006. 

Like most incumbent presidents before him, he has been named most admired man every year since he was elected president. He also received the honor during President George W. Bush's final year in office amid the financial crisis of 2008. 

Bush has been named to the most admired list more times than Obama, though, with 14 appearances in the top 10 compared to Obama's nine, so far.

Evangelical preacher Billy Graham has charted on the most admired list of men more times than any other male since 1946 with 58 mentions. His popularity surpasses former Presidents Ronald Reagan, 34, Jimmy Carter, 28, Bill Clinton, 23 and George H.W. Bush, 20. He also beats out Pope John Paul II's 27 mentions.

Graham came in fourth on the 2014 list with two percent behind Obama, Pope Francis (six percent) and Bill Clinton (three percent).

Rounding out the latter part of this year's most admired men survey were George W. Bush with two percent and retired neurosurgeon and potential GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson, physicist Stephen Hawking, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Fox News personality Bill O'Reilly, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Russian President Vladimir all with one percent.
