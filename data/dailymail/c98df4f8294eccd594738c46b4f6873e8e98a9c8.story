A 50-year-old man accused of murdering his wife spent more than a decade behind bars for murdering his first wife.

Tony Degrafreed allegedly beat and stabbed to death 47-year-old Rebecca Degrafreed in the bedroom of their Indianapolis home about 8am Sunday.

He then allegedly stabbed his wife's son, 19-year-old Jordan Yarbro, in the chest.

Family members said Rebecca married Tony in 2006 after he'd been released from prison for killing his first wife. But the mother-of-three accepted his past and devoted herself to his rehabilitation.

Victim: Rebecca Degrafreed, 47 (right) worked at IU Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis

'He was my sister’s first love,' Christopher Birdsong, Rebecca Degrafreed's brother, told The Indianapolis Star.

'She put her name on his parole papers 
in order for him to get out. She married him and took 
him home and had a home already well fixed for him.'

Birdsong said Tony connected with Rebecca, who'd met as teenagers, as soon as he left prison. The IU Methodist Hospital worker helped him find a job and 'picked him back up.'

It's this generosity of spirit and kindness that Rebecca Degrafreed's loved ones will remember most.

'She was the foundation of her family,' family friend Lynn Howard told WTHR.

'Today she would've been picking her mom up and taking her to church.'

Rebecca's son, Jeffery Yarbro, said his mother pushed everyone to be their best and taught her children that family came first.

'She was taken from us. You know it would be a completely different story if it was natural causes or it was a slip and fall, but she was taken from us,' he told WISHTV.com.

Rebecca's son, Jordan Yarbro, told police he heard thumping noises coming from his parents' bedroom on Sunday.

He was arrested near the intersection of North Arlington Avenue and Devington Road, not far from his home.

Rebecca was found dead on the bedroom floor with head trauma. Jordan Yarbro was not seriously injured.

'We were all just sleeping and we heard a thumping noise and he normally has seizures so we thought he was in there having a seizure and I was knocking on the door banging on the door multiple times,' Yarbro told WTHR.

'I stepped back to kick the door in and he swung it open and came at me trying to stab me...

'It is a hard thing for any child to see, definitely being the baby and losing a twin at birth.'

The Marion County coroner’s office will perform an 
autopsy to determine the manner and cause of death, as Indianapolis investigators work to establish a motive.

On Sunday, Tony Degrafreed faced preliminary murder charges.

In January 1994, Tony Degrafreed was arrested and charged with murder, two counts of attempted murder and illegal possession of a handgun, the The Indianapolis News reported.

According to news reports at the time, he shot his estranged 26-year-old wife, Stacy Degrafreed, in the chest and thigh. She died in hospital.

Police said he also shot two neighbors, Frank and Phyllis Sommerville, in the same incident.

Tony Degrafreed was convicted of murder in 1995 and sentenced to 30 years in prison, but served about half of that.

'He actually got out of prison not too long ago and he came here,' Rebecca Degrafreed's heartbroken son, Jeffery Yarbro, said.

'My mother gave him a place to stay, she put clothes on his back. She found a way to get him a job, make sure he could try to provide.'
