Bill Gates has bought an $18 million horse farm in San Diego from weight-loss guru Jenny Craig.

The 200-acre ranch features a guest house, office, four barns, a mile-long racetrack, and sprawling fields.

It is likely to be a second home for the Microsoft billionaire, and a second racing track for his 18-year-old daughter Jennifer, an avid horse rider.

But it comes amid outrage over Gates's first equestrian estate in Florida where he allegedly pays $250 a day in fines for illegally dumping manure.

Sprawling: The billionaire Gates family will enjoy 200 acres of fields and racing tracks on Jenny Craig's San Diego ranch after buying it for $18 million

 Bespoke: Guests will be treated to panoramic views of the racing track with floor-to-ceiling windows in the study, which comes complete with trophy cupboards

Town inspectors in Wellington, Florida, claim the livestock manure dump on Gates' $8.7 million sprawling property is only 18.75 feet from a narrow pond, while Wellington's code mandates that it be at least 100 feet away.

According to Page Six, the businessman - who is worth around $80 billion - has racked up $40,000 in daily fines so far.

A second code violation apparently relates to Gates not having a proper permit for the storage bin in the first place.

However, he appears unfazed by the furor as he sealed a multi-million deal for a second ranch just days after the allegations emerged.

Paseana Ranch - named after the first champion horse owned by Craig and her late husband - is lined with palm trees, with floor-to-ceiling windows looking out onto the landscape.

It is being sold by real estate agents Catherine and Jason Barry of Barry Estates who deal in opulent properties for the extremely rich and famous. 

Inside, the Gates family will enjoy bespoke wooden surfacing, wooden eaves on sloped ceilings, and numerous trophy cabinets.

In the vast outdoors, Gates plans to build a grand prix track for hunters and jumpers.   

Craig first put the property up for sale in 2010 for $30 million, but was forced to revise the price to $25 million before taking it off the market in fall 2012.

Delighted: Jenny Craig would not reveal Gates (right) bought her ranch but said she was delighted a family with enough wealth to transform it

Extensive: There is space for 34 horses in the stables at Paseana Ranch, named after Craig's first champion mule. But the Gates already have another ranch

Plans: Bill Gates plans to build a grand prix track for hunters and jumpers to visit the center which is lined with palm trees and has a mile-long racing track

Horse-riding fans: Craig, like the Gates family, is an avid horse rider - made plain by the numerous framed photos and paintings and statues of racing horses 

Old fashioned: The living room, decorated with horse-themed curtains and pillows, has a heavy oak table, wooden eaves, and polished flooring

Rise and shine: With small wood-paneled windows letting the San Diego sun shine in every morning, the Gates family will enjoy a sunlit breakfast at this kitchen bar

Luscious: Craig said she is delighted her ranch has been bought by a family with the wealth to maintain the impeccable grounds and elevate it even more

Community: Craig has used the racing track as a facility for horse riders across San Diego and hopes the Gates family will do the same

Towering: The property's buildings are shrouded by trees on the California hills with rambling mountains in the background

Finally, the Gates snapped up the ranch for $18 million - despite it not being listed with any real estates agents.

'I was happy that the buyer is someone who can afford to turn it into the showplace it was meant to be,' Craig said, refusing to name the buyer. 

'It will be kept as a horse barn so the neighbors will be thrilled... the person who bought it will make it like it can and should be.'

A spokesman for the Gates family told the San Diego Tribune: 'The family has enjoyed visiting the San Diego area with friends and family for many years and has purchased the Rancho Paseana property in Rancho Santa Fe, California.'
