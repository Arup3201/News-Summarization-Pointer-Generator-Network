Two fisherman have had a frightening brush with fate after their small fishing boat was stalked by a six-metre long crocodile.

Andy Thomsen and a friend were fly fishing from their dinghy in the Hinchenbrook Channel in far north Queensland at the weekend when they spotted the monster croc. 

The crocodile stalked them along the river over 40 minutes before emerging just two metres from their boat.

Mr Thomsen, who managed to catch the encounter on camera, had to move his boat twice in order to get away but the crocodile kept following them.

'He came right up to us and eyeballed us. His head was about 80 centimetres long,' he told the ABC.

'I do see a few big crocodiles, but (this) is the closest and most worrying I've ever had. It scared the hell out of us. My heart was just going.'

The experienced fisherman said he was unsure whether to approach the motor to try and get away or just sit tight on the boat.

The pair ended up yelling at the crocodile and shooing it away.

The pair first spotted the monster croc in some mangroves before it started to follow their boat.

'He could quite easily lunge two metres,' Mr Thomsen said.

'If we had been in a smaller boat or a kayak this crocodile would have attacked us for sure trying to maintain dominance in its territory.'
