Jose Mourinho spent the summer transfer window adding expensive jewels to his unpolished Chelsea side, and now the Blues boss has been spotted picking up some of his own on a shopping trip in London.

Having overseen his charges taking a commanding lead in their Champions League group with an impressive 6-0 win over Maribor on Tuesday night, Mourinho was indulging in some retail therapy on his day off ahead of a trip to Manchester United on Sunday.

While Blues fans are sweating over the fitness of Diego Costa and Loic Remy for the trip to Old Trafford, Mourinho instructed his staff not to call him about injuries on his day off, and instead payed a visit to the Cartier store.

'We don't cry on injuries,' Mourinho said. 'We cannot hide. In this moment we have some problems with players that are not available to play.

'(Wednesday) is a day off and the doctor is forbidden to call me to speak about injuries. I don't want to speak about injuries. I don't want to know.'

Diego Costa is still struggling with a hamstring injury suffered on international duty with Spain while Loic Remy was hauled off against Maribor with a groin problem.

Mourinho has said he does not know when Costa will return to fitness.Remy claimed he could be fit for the trip to Manchester but his boss suspects both players will be missing at Old Trafford.
