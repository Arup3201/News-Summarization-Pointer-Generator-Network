West Bromwich Albion have revived their interest in Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher after his move to West Ham collapsed.

Fletcher, 30, was poised to sign for the Upton Park club after travelling to London on Friday to undergo a medical and discuss terms. 

Darren Fletcher's move to West Ham fell through after he failed to agree personal terms

However, after further talks, West Ham then tried to make the transfer a loan rather than a permanent deal and Fletcher and United pulled the plug.

United had agreed to let Fletcher go on a free transfer. Manager Louis Van Gaal said: 'I thought Darren was going to sign a contract but at the end they look for a loan and that was not the agreement.

'When you allow your player to go to London for the medical, there is no problem. At the end there is no agreement, it is strange.'

Fletcher was due to sign a two and a half year deal worth around £60,000 a week. Rumours circulated that there were concerns over his fitness but Fletcher is cured of his ulcerative colitis condition after surgery last year and United confirmed that he is one of only four players to have a 100 per cent attendance record for club training sessions this season. 

Fletcher's expected arrival had raised questions over the future of West Ham midfielder Mark Noble with QPR and West Brom showing an interest in the 27-year-old. Noble is out of contract in the summer but has a two year option which if triggered raises his salary to £50,000 a week.

West Ham will still consider other short term loan options to provide cover.

Speaking after their's 2-0 defeat at Liverpool, manager Sam Allardyce confirmed the Fletcher deal had stalled:

'Fletcher broke down on negotiations this morning,' he said. 'I really don't know (what will happen) at this moment in time.'

United boss Van Gaal added: 'He is my third captain so it is not a problem for me (if he comes back). Manchester United just want to help him play more. For him now that is a big pity.

'We want to help Fletcher. That is my only concern. I am very happy he is coming back.'

Albion moved to make way for Fletcher by opening talks with Burnley over the proposed sale of Graham Dorrans for around £3million. Manager Tony Pulis also has an interest in Tottenham midfielder Etienne Capoue.
