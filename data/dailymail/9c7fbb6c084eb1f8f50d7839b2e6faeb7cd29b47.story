A 10-year-old Michigan boy ran over his 9-year-old brother with a stolen car in the state's northern Lower Peninsula, authorities said.

The younger boy was successfully freed and airlifted to a Flint hospital for treatment.

The 9-year-old's ordeal took place after he and his older brother twice stole cars from a Village of Roscommon dealership.

Investigation: A 10-year-old Michigan boy seemingly ran over his 9-year-old brother with a stolen car in the state's northern Lower Peninsula, authorities said. The two boys are believed to have used a cooler to break into a used car dealership (pictured) 

The Roscommon County Sheriff's Department responded at approximately 2:30am Sunday after receiving a call, Detective Sergeant John Wybraniec, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, told Daily Mail Online.

The boys live with their grandparents across the street from the used car dealership, he said.

Wybraniec said deputies responded to the initial break-in and saw the lights were on inside, that a northeast window had been broken, and that there was a cooler underneath it. 

After securing the business, deputies noticed that vehicles outside were 'askew, not in a neat line that they normally are,' Wybraniec told Daily Mail Online.

The sheriff's department said in a news release that thieves swiped car keys and wreaked havoc at the dealership by driving cars and slamming them around. The boys confessed to the joyrides, according to the sheriff's department.

Wybraniec told Daily Mail Online said that the boys took out a 2009 Impala and a 2012 Malibu, and that a total of six vehicles were damaged. 

He said that deputies collected the car keys and the Department of Human Services was contacted.

Deputies received a call around 11:30am on Sunday, Wybraniec said. 

The two boys took the same cars out and drove along Shelley Street. One car, the 2012 Malibu, slammed into a snow bank and got stuck, he said.

Wybraniec said that the 10-year-old was behind the wheel of the 2009 Impala that he seemingly drove over his brother.

'We think it's inadvertently,' he told Daily Mail Online. 

The boy was found underneath the car in a vacant lot next to their house. Wybraniec said that the boys' grandmother discovered the 9-year-old pinned underneath and contacted 911.

Wybraniec said it didn't appear his injuries were life-threatening, but that their extent is unknown.

He said that deputies do not know the motive for stealing the cars, but that it appears the pair snuck out after their grandparents went to sleep and used the cooler for the break-in.

The brothers, who both have learning disabilities, spoke to police and will be interviewed this week by a Children's Assessment Center specialist, Wybraniec said.

Charges are possible but unlikely, he said.
