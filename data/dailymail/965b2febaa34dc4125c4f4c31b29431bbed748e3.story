A music promoter allegedly stalked his ex and her new lover for months before shooting them both in the head outside a motel.

Joseph Kernizan is suspected of gunning down Tracy Bennett and her reggae star boyfriend Wayne Hamilton as they left a New York motel following a steamy tryst.

Ms Bennett, 38, was heard begging for her life in the Bronx car park before she and Mr Hamilton were murdered, witnesses said.

Mr Hamilton, also known as Captain Barkey, had apparently previously taunted his lover's former partner in a song called Nah Lef Joe.

The track, released in 2010, is about 
about having sex with a woman who has not left her partner, with the 
chorus running, 'She tell me she nah lef Joe.'

Friends said the song was aimed at 
Kernizan, 42, who police are hunting in connection with Saturday's 
double murder outside the Holiday Motel.

'It’s a song about her not leaving Joe,'
said Ms Bennett’s friend Bella, who declined to give her last name. 'He
was begging her to leave Joe for a long time.'

Mr Hamilton, 50, had repeatedly been warned 
by friends to end the affair because Kernizan was 'a serious man,' 
dancehall artist Wickerman told Jamaican entertainment news site 
One876Entertainment.

Hamilton’s grieving music partner, David 'Wickerman' Taylor, told the New York Post that Kernizan had been stalking Mr Hamilton for months.

'It was August when he told me that this man in New York was following him,' Mr Taylor said in an emotional interview from Jamaica.

'Barkey said the man trailed him, he was stalking him. And he tried to run him down, off the road.

'I said, "You’ve got to be careful." I warned him, "You don’t know what this guy will do."

'We figured he had a tracking device on her.

'That was Barkey’s only enemy. Everyone loved him. He was not a troublemaker.'

On the run: Police suspect Joseph Kernizan of murdering Ms Bennett, the mother of his children, and her lover in cold blood

Police believe Kernizan was waiting when Ms Bennett and Mr Hamilton emerged from the 
Holiday Motel at around 3.10am and were about to drive away.

Ms Bennett screamed: 'Don't do it! Don't do it!' before her jilted boyfriend allegedly fired more than two dozen 
bullets at the defenceless pair.

Mr Hamilton was shot several times in the back of the head as he tried to run away, while Ms Bennett was shot in the head as she stood beside a
Toyota Camry with the motor running.

Witnesses who 
were celebrating a birthday in a room upstairs said they overheard four or five gunshots, 1010 WINS reported, and ran to see 
what was happening.

'I looked out my window and saw a lady standing there,' said party guest Ricky Gugliotta.

Singing career: Mr Hamilton, left, who went by the stage name Captain Barkey, had moved from his native Jamaica to Wisconsin, where he lived with wife Mavis

'She was begging him not to shoot her, but then he shot her twice and she went down.'

Both were pronounced dead at the scene by emergency services, according to the New York Daily News.

Kernizan fled the scene in a blue or green sedan, sources said.

Motel guest Augustine Mawugbe, 45, said he was asleep in his room when he heard gunshots.

He said he looked outside and saw a tall man in a brown polo shirt firing a pistol.

'Aggression': Neighbours said Kernizan, pictured in a police mugshot, was regularly heard having loud arguments with Ms Bennett, the mother of two of his children

He said 
the man fired about ten times, and then got into a light green Toyota Camry 
or Ford Taurus and drove away at speed.

Ms Bennett had been dating Ms Hamilton for five years, friends said, but had struggled to leave Kernizan, the father of two of her three children, a 12-year-old girl and seven-year-old boy.

Her oldest child, daughter Dajahnae, 18, rushed home from the University of Baltimore after learning her mother was dead.

'He was so obsessed with her,' said her friend Bella.

The 38-year-old even took out an order of protection against the music promoter, making him even more enraged, said others.

Crime scene: The cold-blooded murders took place in the parking lot of Holiday Motel in The Bronx

Her neighbours said they often heard her and Kernizan, nicknamed 'Country', 
screaming at each other and police were regularly called to their tidy 
two-storey home.

'We always heard them fighting,' said Carolina Manzano.

Neighbours described Ms Bennett as a sweet woman who was seen 
leaving her house every morning for her job as a nurse at Winthrop University Hospital, while Kernizan stayed out late and often returned in flashy cars.

Tenants at a house he owned in Brooklyn said he also owned a nearby barbershop, opened a club and owned four different cars.

Mr Hamilton's
friends said he was 
originally from Jamaica but was now living in Milwaukee with his wife Mavis, who knew nothing about his affair with Ms Bennett.

Tragedy: Guests at the motel saw Mr Hamilton and Ms Bennett celebrating with a bottle of champagne just hours before the early morning murders

‘I saw him last night at Memories playing dominoes,’ said Oneil Taylor, referring to a Bronx nightclub.

Another
friend, an shuttle driver, said he had picked up Mr Hamilton - best known for his 1996 hit Go Go Wine - on Friday from 
the airport and brought him to the Fenton Avenue club. 

Mrs Hamilton, who had dropped him off at the airport on Friday for his trip to New York, left worried messages for him when she did not hear from anything.

The 48-year-old said: 'Now that he’s dead, what can I do? The memories that I’ll keep is the man that I know that loved me.

'He was the funniest, kindest, most loving person you would ever meet.'

Other guests reported seeing the couple several hours 
before the murders with their arms around one another.

One patron said they saw Ms Bennett holding a bottle of champagne in a celebratory manner.
