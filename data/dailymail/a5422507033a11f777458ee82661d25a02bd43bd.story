David Cameron has made clear he wants to put British businesses centre stage on his trade trip to China.

But his business ambassador Karren Brady was almost squeezed out of the picture as the Prime Minister posed with Chinese leaders on the first day of his tour.

The Apprentice star appeared to be photobombing Mr Cameron on the steps of the Great Hall of the People in Bejing.

Miss Brady is one of more than 130 business men and women who have joined Mr Cameron on his trip, sparking accusations of cronyism.

Joining him on the trade mission are his father-in-law, a neighbour and a major Tory donor as well as a string of eyebrow-raising names.

Mr Cameron faced accusations of 
cronyism after flying to Beijing yesterday at the head of the trade 
mission which features his father-in-law, a neighbour and a major Tory 
donor as well as a string of eyebrow-raising names.

Downing Street protested to China's Communist rulers after a journalist was barred from entering the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.

US news agency Bloomberg was told it was not welcome - apparently because it had covered the financial affairs of China's president and his family.

Robert Hutton, the agency's London-based reporter travelling with the Prime Minister, was forced to wait outside while others were ushered in to hear president Xi Jinping and David Cameron speak about their talks.

A Number 10 spokesman said: 'As soon as this issue became apparent on Sunday, we raised our concerns at senior levels and made clear it would be completely inappropriate to exclude journalists from the press statements.

'When we heard what had happened today we expressed our deep concern to senior Chinese officials about journalists being blocked.'

A number have a close personal link to him – including his wife Samantha’s stepfather Viscount Astor.

But
also on the plane were Sir Peter Bazalgette, who brought Big Brother 
into UK living rooms, and Miss Brady, vice-chairman of West Ham 
United.

Downing Street today denied it was a 'crony trip'. A spokesman said: 'The delegation list is drawn together by UKTI. It is determined on the basis of the very best business opportunities. It is all about getting the very best business opportunities for the UK,” the spokesman said.

The spokesman said that all the business delegates were required to pay their own way on the trip.

Mr Cameron today vowed to tear down the ‘bamboo curtain’ of trade barriers which stops China from investing in Britain.

The
Prime Minister used the start of a trade visit in Beijing to warn the 
European Union not to fear the rise of the economic super-power.

And
he insisted he is not ‘embarrassed’ that Britain’s nuclear power 
stations, Heathrow Airport and Thames Water are being funded by Chinese 
money.

After holding talks 
with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, Mr Cameron brushed aside criticism of 
his enthusiasm for striking trade deals with Beijing.

The two men stood alongside one 
another to make statements to reporters after their talks in the Great 
Hall of the People in Beijing, but did not take questions.

Mr
Cameron said: ‘I see China’s rise as an opportunity not just for the 
people of this country but for Britain and the world,’ said Mr Cameron.

‘Britain wants China to realise its dream and I believe we can help each other succeed in the global race.

‘Some
in Europe and elsewhere see the world changing and want to shut China 
off behind a bamboo curtain of trade barriers. Britain wants to tear 
these trade barriers down.

‘An
open Britain is the ideal partner for an opening China... No country in
the world is more open to Chinese investment than the UK.’

He
declared his intention to champion a free trade agreement between the 
European Union and China, which he believes could be worth tens of 
billions of pounds a year - with a potential £1.8 billion boost for the 
UK alone.

China’s leadership held out the prospect of providing billions in investment for the controversial HS2 rail project and a new generation of nuclear power stations in the UK.

Mr Li said: ‘On infrastructure, the two sides have agreed to push for breakthroughs and progress in co-operation on our enterprises in nuclear power and high-speed railway.

‘The Chinese side is willing to not only participate but also purchase equities and stocks in UK nuclear power projects, and the UK side is open to this idea.’

Mr Li and Mr Cameron also announced that they had agreed a £200 million joint innovation and research fund to foster scientific collaborations.

Mr Cameron has opened an account on Sina Weibo account, China's version of Twitter, to promote his trip

The Premier characterised the talks as ‘highly productive’ and said that Britain and China had become ‘indispensible partners for each other’s development.’

‘I believe our meeting will usher China/UK relationship onto a new stage,’ said Mr Li. ‘We need to grow this relationship at a higher speed. We can take this relationship to a higher stage at a faster pace.’

Mr Cameron’s painstakingly-constructed schedule for the three-day visit had to be torn up at the last minute, after the Chinese invited him to separate lavish meals with President Xi and Premier Li on the same day.

Downing Street portrayed the invitations as an indication of the value which Beijing places on close relations with the UK and Mr Cameron declared himself ‘delighted’ to secure lengthy discussions with the two men who are expected to lead China through the coming decade.

The changes meant dropping a visit to Hangzhou, but Mr Cameron will still travel to China’s international financial hub Shanghai and the inland city of Chengdu in Sichuan province, a global centre for consumer electronics.

Plans for the visit were delayed by many months by China’s frosty response to Mr Cameron’s meeting with the Dalai Lama in London last year, and Beijing issued its invitation only after Downing Street made clear he had no plans to meet the Tibetan spiritual leader again.

Ahead of his talks with Mr Li, Mr Cameron visited a new training academy for technicians, salesmen and service staff for Jaguar Land Rover, who were signing a £4.5 billion agreement to provide 100,000 cars over the next year.

and friends: David Cameron pictured front centre with his trade

David Cameron arrives in China for the three-day visit. The Prime Minister led Britain's largest ever trade delegation to China with 131 representatives of businesses ranging from financial services to healthcare

There are more than 130 business representatives on the trade trip with Mr Cameron.

But some of the choices have raised eyebrows. Sir Peter Bazalgette was once described as having ‘no known values’ but is now head of the Arts Council quango.

Karren Brady is the Prime Minister’s new ambassador for small businesses, but 
has courted controversy by working for pornography barons in the past.

Former England footballer Graeme Le Saux is on the trip representing the Premier League.

However
it is the inclusion of those with a connection to Mr Cameron that will 
add to the feeling that the Eton-educated Premier is happier dealing 
with privileged ‘cronies’ than those from more ordinary backgrounds.

Apart
from Viscount Astor they include Tory donor Howard Leigh and Lord 
Chadlington, Mr Cameron’s Oxfordshire neighbour and chairman of his 
Witney constituency association.
