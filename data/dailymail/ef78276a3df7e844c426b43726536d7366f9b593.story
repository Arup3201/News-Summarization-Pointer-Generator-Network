To Kill A Mockingbird author Harper Lee rarely talks directly to journalists, so when a US reporter received a note from her telling him to 'go away', it was considered a major coup.

Connor Sheets had been chasing an interview with her for weeks, in part to try and establish that she is lucid. 

Since publisher HarperCollins stunned the literary world with news that Lee is publishing a second novel, controversy has raged about whether the reclusive, 88-year-old novelist is of sound mind.

The blunt reply she gave to Sheets has seemingly put these worries to bed. The writer concluded that this reply could only have come from someone who's of sound mind.

Sheets wrote: 'It appears that Nelle, as her friends call her, is very much with it, that she is still lucid and that her acerbic, press-averse side is fully intact.'

Lee had mesmerizing success with her book To Kill A Mockingbird, released over half a century ago, and fans and writers were both delighted and taken aback to hear that Lee was releasing another novel.

They were even more surprised to learn that it was a manuscript written 60 years ago and hidden away after an editor told the young novelist to recast the book into what would become Mockingbird.

Go Set a Watchman, finished in the mid-1950s, features many of the same characters as Mockingbird and was discovered last year among her papers by lawyer Tonja Carter.

But she was quoted by gossip blog Gawker as saying last July that her client sometimes signed things 'she did not understand'.

Go Set A Watchman is already number one in the best-seller list at online bookstore Amazon, where the 304-page hardback is available for pre-order ahead of its July release. Pictured right is US investigative journalist Connor Sheets who was lucky enough to receive a hand-written note from Lee

Could Lee, who had a stroke in 2007 and so often said she would never publish again, really be happy that a manuscript, long since discarded, was going to see the light of day?

Mr Sheets hasn't been able to answer that question, but has confirmed that she seems to be mentally focussed and harboring a familiar contempt for journalists.

It is well known that Lee has poor eye sight and is deaf. She has lived since 2007 in a nursing home in Monroeville, Alabama, where all requests for visits reportedly go through her lawyer.

Mr Sheets described how he made repeated attempts to talk to her, eventually writing a two-page letter to her on February 5.

This week that letter arrived on his doormat, with four words scribbled at the bottom in black pen - 'Go away! Harper Lee'.

Sheets said: 'She may have softened her language as she has advanced well into her golden years, but the thrust is the same: leave her alone.'

Carter took on the role of Lee's gatekeeper after the author's fiercely protective sister Alice died last summer.

Tongues started wagging and Carter has been on the defensive, telling The New York Times that Lee is 'extremely hurt and humiliated' by allegations that she has been manipulated. 

'She is a very strong, independent and wise woman who should be enjoying the discovery of her long lost novel,' Carter told the newspaper through emails and text messages.

'Instead, she is having to defend her own credibility and decision-making.'

In February Carter released an earlier statement telling fans that Lee is 'happy as hell' about the new book.

US media has fallen on the story, quoting alleged friends and associates of Lee as attesting to her excitement and lucidity, or raising doubts and speculation.

Lee, who rarely speaks to the media, said via HarperCollins that she was 'humbled and amazed' the manuscript was to be published after so many years.

Go Set A Watchman is already number one in the best-seller list at online bookstore Amazon, where the 304-page hardback is available for pre-order ahead of its July release.

NPR reported that Lee's friend, Wayne Flynt, visited her the day before news of the book came out and said she was of sound mind.

'Does she understand what's going on? If you make her hear, she can understand what's going on,' he said on NPR. 'Can she give informed consent? Absolutely, she can give informed consent.'

To Kill A Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Price for its tale of racial injustice in the Great Depression-era South.

Published in 1960, is has become standard reading in American classrooms and has been translated into more than 40 languages, as well as adapted into an Oscar-winning film starring Gregory Peck.

Roberts said that regardless of its merits, Go Set A Watchman will be of important literary and scholarly value.

'What's in a writer's mind is always interesting,' she told AFP.

'Anything that makes people read is good and anything that makes people talk about race in this country is good.'
