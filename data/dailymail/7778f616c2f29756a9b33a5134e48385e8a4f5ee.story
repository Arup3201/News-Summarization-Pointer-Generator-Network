Escape route: Adam Lanza set up an ambush for police with his car in a way that allowed him to flee through the woods

Newtown school shooter Adam Lanza laid out five identical sets of military fatigues in his darkened bedroom and set up an ambush for cops arriving at the school that could have afforded him a chance to flee into the nearby woods, it was revealed today.

The new details - gleaned from an in-depth Connecticut State Police investigation - suggest Lanza could have been planning to escape Sandy Hook Elementary School after shooting dead 20 first grade children and six women.

Detectives still have not determined what drove Lanza to plan and execute the horrific December 14 attack on the innocent teachers and students. 

The new information comes from the Hartford Courant, which published a report Friday with exclusive details from the investigation.

When Lanza arrived at the school, he parked his mother's Honda sedan in a way that would have allowed him to ambush unsuspecting police officers who were arriving at the scene of the shooting.

The passenger side door was facing toward a wall of the school. He leaned a semi-automatic Soviet-style 12-gauge shotgun against the car - presumably to use once police showed up.

He took an AR-15 semi-automatic assault rifle and two handguns inside with him. All four of the weapons belonged to his mother.

Detectives told the Courant that the car was positioned to give Lanza a straight line of fire toward cars headed toward the school up the property's long driveway.

The school and the nearby woods would have been behind him - allowing him cover and, possibly, an escape route. 

The report also details an eery scene that Lanza left back at the million-dollar mansion where he lived with his mother.

In his bedroom, he taped black plastic garbage bags across the windows to block out all sunlight. His bed was crisply made.

And he laid out five identical sets of combat fatigues - tan-colored shirts with five pairs of khaki pants.

In the nearby computer room, detectives found an empty cereal bowl next to the computer hard drives that Lanza had taken out of his computers and tried to smash with a barbell.

Those he didn't smash, he carved a 'W' into.

Lanza's mother, who pulled her son out of public school and home-schooled him, was found in her bed.

She was shot four times in the head with a .22-caliber rifle. The shots were fired at point-blank, with the muzzle of the gun pressed against her forehead. 

Detectives say Lanza's online habits - which include numerous postings about guns and other mass shootings - could provide the greatest clues about his motives.
