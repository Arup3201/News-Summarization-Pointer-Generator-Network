As he greets the hordes of children in a town square outside Sao Paulo, Brazil, Vitor Martins, looks like your standard Santa Claus, with a big white beard, 'bowl-full-of-jelly' belly, round glasses and red robe and hat.

But beneath the Father Christmas outfit hides what might be the world's most tattooed Santa Claus, as Mr Martin has covered 94 per cent of his body in colourful ink - most of it follows a holiday theme. 

The 59-year-old artist, who has been working as a shopping centre Santa for more than 15 years, has decorated his body with everything from Santa Claus himself, his reindeer, Christmas trees and one his arms is adorned with a cheerful - but misspelled - 'Merry Chritmas'.

'For me, as long as I am healthy and can play Santa Claus, it's like a record on my skin. I want to record it as if it were… Vitor Martins throughout the year as an artist is one person, but during these two months, I am the character of Santa Claus,' Mr Martins said.

Looking upon Mr Martins' inked body, there is no mistaking his dedication to his role as Santa Claus.

'I have reindeer here, here I have Santa Claus. I have a snowy background. Here is the key used to open the doors to get into the homes…

'I have a bow; I've got a clover and a star. Here is a Santa with a pine tree that he is going to decorate. There's an elf here who helps Santa in his factory. And here I have written, "Santa Claus - Merry Christmas". And here next to that, the Star of David,' Martins said.

Even though the artist says he is completely dedicated to fulfilling the part of Santa, he says not everyone is so thrilled when they discover he is almost completely covered in tattoos.

'Some people seek me out to find out who this "tattooed Santa" is. While others find out (I have tattoos) and all of a sudden they don't want to work with me anymore and look for a different Santa. It depends a lot on the individual,' Martins said.

All the same, this father of two says he understands why some people might hesitate to let their child sit on a tattoo-covered Santa.

But he also says he thinks the prejudice he sometimes faces will someday be a thing of the past as younger generations grow up more accustomed to people sporting skin art.

'So you and your wife have tattoos, but your kids don't yet. But when they're ten or 12-years-old, they're gonna want to get one, and you won't be able to say "no", because you have some. So this generation is going to change.

'The day will come when I'm sitting in the chair in the shopping mall, not in a bathing suit, but in a pair of shorts and flip-flops and the little hat with a ball hangin' there asking, "Hey buddy, how's it goin'? What'd ya want this Christmas?" ya know?' Martins said
