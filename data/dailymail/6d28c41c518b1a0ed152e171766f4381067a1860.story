A NSW Nationals MP told a female cabinet minister that he would 'tear her a new orifice' and said she had 'never had a real man' because he was unhappy with a decision made by her department.

John Williams, the Nationals member for Murray-Darling, verbally abused then-environment minister and NSW Liberal MP Robyn Parker in April this year.

Ms Parker has spoken publicly about how she was raped as a teenager and lived in fear afterwards, nailing the windows of her bedroom shut.

John Williams aimed a sexist attack at NSW Liberal MP Robyn Parker, threatening that he would 'tear her a new orifice'

The attack occurred during his bid for pre-selection for the upper house in April in front of 100 Nationals members, reported the Sydney Morning Herald.

Nationals members who attended the pre-selection meeting at Parliament House told the Sydney Morning Herald they were offended by Mr Williams' comment, but the sexist comments were not publicly admonished by party leaders present at the event.

Mr Williams was endorsed by the party, but is in fourth position on the ballot, meaning it is highly unlikely he will be elected to the upper house in the state election next March.

Mr Williams wrote a letter to Ms Parker the day after the pre-selection meetingÂ  in which he acknowledged the incident, though most of the letter was dedicated to urging Ms Parker to reversing the decision of her 'megalomaniac bureaucrats' the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Ms Parker said that abuse such as this is a deterrent for young women who might wish to enter politics

'Regrettably, I let my emotions take over and said some things that probably destroyed my chances of a winnable place,' Mr Williams wrote to Ms Parker.

The incident highlights the sexist treatment women encounter while in office, said Ms Parker.

'When I am trying to encourage young women to take leadership roles, this is the sort of behaviour they are up against. It's no wonder they choose an alternative path,' Ms Parker told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Mr Williams has been the member for Murray-Darling since 2007, however the recent redistribution of electoral boundaries meant his electorate combined with Barwon, which is currently represented by Nationals cabinet minister Kevin Humphries.

Mr Williams agreed to run for the upper house, rather than contest Mr Humphries's seat.

The Nationals party can expect to secure three seats in the upper house in next year's state election, so Mr Williams's position in fourth place on the ballot means his seat is almost unwinnable.
