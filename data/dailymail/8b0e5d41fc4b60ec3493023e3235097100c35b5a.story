The beautiful game has been made 
even more beautiful. And while those looking for significant overhauls 
to the FIFA recipe may be left wanting, subtle tweaks make FIFA 14 the 
most complete outing yet.

Take
 the improved animation for example. Players move and feel like real 
human beings, transferring their weight convincingly and colliding with 
wince-inducing authenticity.

Overall
 presentation remains strong. Graphically, it’s almost identical to its 
predecessor, but pre-match introductions and the general look on the 
whole has been polished. During matches, for example, a flood of stats 
are drip-fed on to the screen – ranging from shots on target, possession
 and total number of saves each goalkeeper has made. Coupled with strong
 commentary and it all adds to a wonderfully authentic experience.

Up-close,
 though, and players still have that gormless look in their eyes, while 
during replays, player movement is much less smooth.

No
 matter, as for those who can stand waiting a month or two for the 
next-gen version of the game, the next-gen Ignite Engine allows for even
 more realistic animation and AI.

The
 most significant tweak to gameplay is the Precision Movement mechanic –
 that is easier to use than ever before. Given improved ball physics, 
combining close control with dribbling at speed makes you feel much more
 in control of attacking plays. AI, too, is with you every step of the 
way.

Make a break, and you’ll be flooded with options. Get caught out, and your team will actively retreat and fight for the ball.

It’s not all 
positive, though. The dynamic camera has already come under flak by some
 online forums for making the players too small (a feature that is 
likely to be patched) and passing still feels slightly wayward compared 
to Pro Evolution Soccer 2014. The ability to home in on a player during 
matches and solely control them isn’t much fun, either.

As
 well as a host of standard game modes, from seasons to exhibition 
matches, it’s the Ultimate Team that is the most intriguing.

Borrowing 
from role-playing games’ staple XP system, you can determine the style 
of your players – boosting certain skills over a period of time.

You’ll
 have to keep an eye on player chemistry changes, and you can even edit 
kit numbers and pick who takes free kicks and corners. Thankfully, coins
 and points can be transferred from Xbox 360 and PS3 to their next –gen 
successors, for those keen on both versions of the game.

Indeed,
 it’s hard to find a serious fault with FIFA 14 – but I won’t be alone 
in thinking that there are only so many touch-ups EA Sports can apply 
before it starts feeling stale.

FIFA 14 is out now.
