Mauricio Pochettino was teased about his linguistic capabilities but for once his team did the talking.

A single strike by Christian Eriksen translated into a much-needed win for Tottenham and a small degree of revenge for their boss.

Pochettino was bombarded with abuse from Saints fans from the moment he emerged from the tunnel until hope had been squeezed from Ronald Koeman’s team. ‘Where’s your translator gone?’ they wanted to know, among other, less polite, questions. Spurs, so often lacking fluency under the manager they lured from St Mary’s, actually produced a response to make the Argentine proud and go into the international break within a goal of fourth-placed Manchester United.

It proves how congested the Barclays Premier League is behind the top two. Perhaps there is a Champions League place for Pochettino to target. On this evidence, he is finally injecting solidity into the team. They were less creative in attack but Eriksen’s second goal of the season ended a run of four League games without a win.

‘It was an emotional game for me,’ said Pochettino. ‘I love Southampton. It was a great 18 months for me and my family and it was a tough decision to leave. But I can understand the fans. This is football.

‘It doesn’t change my feelings. I will always be grateful to the club and the people of Southampton. My decision is done. I have no regrets. I am happy to be here and happy with the win. It was important to get the three points.’

Koeman claimed the supporters ought to have shown more respect.

‘That’s the reaction of the fans but I don’t agree,’ said the Southampton boss. ‘Everybody deserves respect. Normally, respect is high in the Premier League. Mauricio did a great job at Southampton and now he’s the manager of Tottenham.’

Koeman, above all, was upset not to leave with a point. His team were committed and industrious and matched Spurs in midfield but rarely looked like scoring in a game bookended by two chances missed by Sadio Mane.

The former was deflected wide by Kyle Naughton and the latter squirted wide as he failed to convert a cross fizzed in from the left by Ryan Bertrand.

Naughton left White Hart Lane on crutches, his right foot and ankle in a protective boot after a nasty Bertrand challenge in the first half.

Bertrand left his studs up and Naughton’s leg twisted under impact. He will have a scan today to determine the damage. ‘It was a big hit,’ admitted Pochettino.

The contest was tight and aggressive, with the rhythm often disrupted by the need for medics to treat players — though Mane has an annoying habit of exaggerating contact, which the officials will soon catch on to.

Ultimately, it was about who would be most clinical and that was Spurs, who must have been encouraged by a nervous performance by Fraser Forster, in stark contrast to the immaculate-as-ever Hugo Lloris.

The game was only three minutes old when Bertrand cleared off his line to deny Jan Vertonghen. Erik Lamela also went close, clipping a post with a slider from distance.

It seemed a deliberate policy to test Forster with low shots from distance. The England goalkeeper rode his luck when he spilt an effort from Eriksen and saw it spin wide of the post, but was beaten five minutes before half-time.

Emmanuel Adebayor and Nacer Chadli linked up neatly on the left and Chadli nursed the ball out to Eriksen, who smashed it low into the corner.

Forster was beaten again seconds later when Spurs sprang out of defence on a quick break launched by Lamela. Adebayor unzipped the defence to release Chadli, who clipped a shot past the keeper but it thumped into a post and was scrambled away.

Lloris saved a free-kick by Dusan Tadic before the interval and there was a curious incident soon after the restart, when Younes Kaboul eased Mane off the ball with a shoulder and referee Mike Jones awarded a foul. 

Nacer Chadli has been involved in five of Tottenham’s nine Premier League goals this season. He has scored four and now set up one. 

It didn’t look like a foul but Kaboul was certainly the last man by some considerable distance. If Jones thought it was a foul he should have shown the red card.

Koeman seemed to agree, but added: ‘I think a yellow is OK.’

He was in dangerous territory here, considering how he stayed on after a last-man foul on David Platt and then scored against England as they were denied a place at the World Cup in 1994.

It almost worked in Southampton’s favour when Kaboul sliced a clearance to Victor Wanyama on the edge of the box, but Lloris preserved the lead with a good save.

Pochettino faced the Saints for the first time since his departure in the summer. Matt Barlow runs the rule over how he coped. 

RECEPTION: Not good at all. Noisily jeered by Southampton fans as he emerged from the tunnel and the target for plenty of verbals in the first half-hour. ‘Who the f*** is Pochettino,’ they sang, ‘Sit down Mauricio,’ and ‘Where’s your translator gone?’ 

There was a barrage of x-rated abuse whenever he stood up and ventured to the edge of the pitch. In all this time, there was little by way of positive support from the Spurs fans. 

BODY LANGUAGE: Defiant and untroubled. Having ditched his Spurs tracksuit for his Sunday best, Pochettino stood with his back to the visiting fans early in the game, anxiously passing messages on to the pitch as his team started slowly. 

Once they were ahead, he relaxed. Only occasionally did he seem exasperated, usually when possession had been surrendered cheaply, and he embraced those he replaced as they came off. 

TACTICS: It took Spurs time to impose their style on the game. The two teams, both under orders to press, seemed to neutralise each other. Defences were strong and chances were rare. 

Spurs created the better ones and looked more solid, helped by the fact Hugo Lloris was faultless as usual while Fraser Forster was clumsy and errorprone and Christian Eriksen found a gem to win the game.
