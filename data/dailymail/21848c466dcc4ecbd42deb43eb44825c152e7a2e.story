Tony Blair’s Downing Street was accused of trying to ‘pervert the course of justice’ yesterday after it emerged it had contacted the police – at the request of Gerry Adams – to demand the release of an  IRA gunman.

An inquiry by MPs heard explosive new evidence from an ex-senior police officer linking the former Prime Minister to the controversial amnesty granted to on-the-run IRA suspects.

It is the first time the Blair administration has been accused of direct interference on behalf of Sinn Fein  to secure the freedom of IRA  terror suspects.

Norman Baxter, former Detective Chief Spt of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, said he had arrested two men in March 2007 in relation to the shooting of a soldier.

He said that, within hours, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams had contacted No 10 to request the release of Gerry McGeough, 55, and Vincent McAnespie, 51.

Mr Baxter claimed: ‘Downing Street rang the chief constable’s office looking for their release. I got a call suggesting I should release them.

'That in my mind is perverting the course of justice. That, as a police officer, is totally illegal and unconstitutional’.

Mr Baxter refused the request and, four years later, McGeough was convicted of the attempted murder in 1981 of part-time Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) soldier Sammy Brush.

Mr McAnespie was acquitted of helping with the attack.

The Westminster committee is probing the case of John Downey, who was accused of the 1982 IRA murder of four soldiers in the Hyde Park bombing.

To widespread fury, the charges against Mr Downey were dropped earlier this year after it emerged he had been mistakenly sent a letter by the Northern Ireland Office saying he was not wanted in Britain for any criminal offences.

Ministers had sought to lay the blame on the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which supposedly supplied the information that Mr Downey was not wanted by the Met.

But Mr Baxter categorically denied this was the case and accused the current Northern Ireland Secretary, Theresa Villiers, of ‘disgracefully’ trying to shift the blame away from the politicians and on to police.

In evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, Mr Baxter claimed there was ‘a culture within the Northern Ireland Office to ensure that republicans were not prosecuted’.

Around 200 on-the-run terror suspects were granted an effective amnesty following the 1998 Good Friday Agreement negotiated by Mr Blair.

The then Prime Minister was under pressure from Sinn Fein to grant them amnesty to secure the peace.

Former PSNI assistant chief constable Peter Sheridan also gave evidence to the committee.

He said the professionals at the NIO knew where the line constituting political interference was and did not cross it, as far as he was aware. He also insisted police acted properly.

An independent review of the Downey case has been ordered by David Cameron.
