Upheaval must suit Wasps. They were braced for mass protests at Adams Park on Sunday, after announcing a mid-season relocation to Coventry, but there was euphoria rather than anger as Bath were beaten.

In the build-up to this Aviva Premiership match, there had been talk of demonstrations following the confirmation that Wasps will be based at the Ricoh Arena from December. Yet, any groundswell of angst was well disguised. There was one banner describing the nomadic club as a ‘franchise’, but even that had vanished by the second-half as Dai Young’s team stormed into a commanding lead.

Ultimately, Wasps had to withstand a late Bath rear-guard action as the visitors recovered from 29-0 down to earn a losing bonus point, but there was a collective desperation among the home players to end a turbulent week on a high, which they duly did. Their feat was all the more remarkable as the controversy surrounding their imminent move was not the only disruption.

England lock Joe Launchbury was withdrawn from the team on Sunday morning after being involved in a car crash - just as his team-mate, Christian Wade, was last month. Young, the Wasps’ director of rugby, said: ‘There’s never a dull moment here.

‘Joe is fine. Him and his girlfriend were involved in car accident on the way to the game. They were a little bit shaken up. They went to hospital for a check-up and they’re both fine.’

So the last-minute loss of a key forward was a setback for Wasps, but they were glad to avoid the spectre of off-field unrest among their supporters. If anything, the announcement that they are off to the West Midlands seemed to have unexpectedly positive consequences - as they were vociferously backed by their biggest home attendance of the season.

Captain James Haskell was evidently delighted by the reception accorded to he and his team-mates, saying: ‘I don’t know about protests - that’s the biggest crowd we’ve had this season.

'Perhaps we should say we’re moving somewhere else next week and we’ll get another big crowd.’

England star Joe Launchbury missed Wasps' victory over Bath after he and his pregnant partner were involved in a car crash.

Launchbury tweeted: 'Great win Wasps Rugby today. Gutted to have missed out. Thanks for all your messages of concern.

'Had to go to hospital and check all was ok with my pregnant partner and baby after someone crashed into us. Luckily all is good!'

Young added: ‘I totally understood the frustrations of the supporters early in the week, but once we explained everything properly, I saw a real change in their attitude to the move. It was a tough week for them but they got behind the team today and they should be commended and thanked for that.’

If Wasps’ early matches in Coventry are as entertaining as this, they may soon attract decent crowds to the Ricoh Arena. They routed Bath at the scrum as Matt Mullan turned the screw on England’s current first-choice tighthead prop, David Wilson, and from that platform they surged into a 15-0 lead courtesy of four Andy Goode penalties and one long-range shot from Elliot Daly.

The visitors were all at sea in the set piece and they were in deeper disarray when three of their players were sent to the sin bin - Leroy Houston, Wilson and Micky Young. The latter man’s off-the-ball tackle on Wade as he chased through a kick by Daly led to a penalty try for Wasps in the 47th minute and left Bath down to 13 men.

Moments later, Haskell released the outstanding Ashley Johnson from the back of a lineout on halfway and the flanker's superb off-load sent Sailosi Tagicakibau through a gap and he tore away to score by the posts. Goode converted again and any prospect of protests had been blown away as Wasps seized a 29-0 lead.

But Bath have spirit to go with their attacking artistry and they rallied impressively. Kyle Eastmond’s pass picked out Jonathan Joseph on the left and the in-form centre fended off James Gaskell to touch down. Sixteen minutes from time, the deficit was down to 17 points as Young swerved over from close range and George Ford converted.

The West Country side kept coming - sensing a way back from a seemingly hopeless position - and after another thunderous drive by Houston, David Sisi scored. Again, Ford added the extras and he followed that up with a 76th-minute penalty, but Wasps held firm to deny their rivals a draw.

Young was relieved, saying: ‘That’s pretty much us all over - we either start really poorly and come back, or we end poorly, like we did today. We’re still searching for an 80-minute performance, but for 65 minutes we were outstanding.’

Bath’s head coach, Mike Ford, added: ‘We were just a bit off today - we didn’t have that edge. Our scrum wasn’t as good as it has been for the last two years. They wanted it more than us.’
