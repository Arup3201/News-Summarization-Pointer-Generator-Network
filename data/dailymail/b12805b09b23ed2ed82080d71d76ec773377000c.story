Christmas letters from German Second World War soldiers have finally been delivered 71 years after they were stolen during the occupation of Jersey.

The 86 cards and letters, written by Nazi soldiers to their loved ones back home, were discovered five years ago hidden in the back of a piano.

After months of painstaking research the greetings, dated December 16 and 17, 1941, have finally been handed to their intended recipients.

Michael McNally, head of international development at Jersey Post, which worked with their German counterparts on the project, said delivering the Christmas gift as ‘a really emotional experience for all’.

Ten of the ninety letters were delivered on Tuesday - the date they would originally have been received.

One letter said: ‘I wish you a merry Christmas and all the best for the New Year.

‘But what I hope most is that the war will come to an end soon, so that we can all enjoy life again.’

Farmer Engelbert Bergmann, 55, of Frankfurt, received a letter written by soldier Emil Adam, a neighbour of his grandfather.

He
said: ‘I feel it is very important to have the other letters delivered 
in these cases where family or sons and daughters are still around.’

Michael McNally of Jersey Post said being able to deliver ten of the lost letters was 'beyond our hopes'

Another from Lance-Corporal Lothar Wilhelm's fiancee Kaete Schwartz read: 'Christmas won't be so happy for me this yer, because I'm only happy when I'm with you. God grant that we can spend next year's Christmas together again', according to The Times.

They were delivered to her grandchildren.

The bag of letters were stolen by a group of teenage boys from a German Army post office in St Helier in 1941 - 18 months after the invasion of the Channel Island.

It was one of a number of small acts of resistance carried out by islanders.

But even that small act could have resulted in deportation or even death.

They remained hidden in the piano until 2007 when they were handed to the Jersey Archive by an anonymous man.

Although the teenagers survived the war they vowed to never speak of the theft again.

Jersey Post spokesman told The Times a 16-year-old friend had been asked to hold onto the letters and still feels 'very strongly' that it will be wrong to talk about it now.

Handwriting experts, the German military and the German Red Cross were all consulted by Jersey Post and Deutsche Post during their research.

Felix Blaich, from Deutsche Post, said finding the recipients was difficult because many had moved or were no longer alive, some were addressed to PO Box numbers which no longer existed and others were marked for places which were not part of modern Germany.

He said: ‘We had to translate the old street names into the 2012 addresses.

‘Then we found out that not many of the addresses had people living with the same name any more so we used our address expertise, our databases, our military mail experts as well as registry offices.’

Mr McNally said: ‘When we were first asked to help we thought it would be an impossible task. So much time has passed and Germany has changed considerably, both geographically and demographically.

‘When we started out on this journey we thought it would be fantastic if we could find members of just one of the families involved to find ten is beyond our hopes.

'That’s the power of receiving something hand-written from someone close to you.'

At the time of the theft, islanders were beginning to be prosecuted for small acts of resistance and insulting the authorities.

The Channel Islands surrendered to Nazi forces in 1940 without a fight as Winston Churchill deemed them indefensible.

In Guernsey children of school age were evacuated and most of Aldernay's residents chose to leave. In Sark islanders were encouraged to stay.

In Jersey most islanders stayed, either through choice or because they could not get out.

Shortly before the invasion, 23,000 people queued in St Helier for days to register for the few boats travelling to the mainland. 

Only about 7,000 managed to flee before the German invasion.

The Channel Islands, including Herm, became heavily militarised as Adolf Hitler saw them as a strategic point from which to launch an invasion of France. 

During the occupation, the courts and the government were taken over and a register of the island's Jews was created. 

A curfew was also imposed on the islanders and people aged 14 or over had to carry identification cards.

Radios were confiscated but many had been hidden to allow residents to listen to the BBC. 

Towards the end of the occupation, islanders were faced with starvation when routes to the islands were cut off following the D-Day landings. It was only averted when the Red Cross was permitted to drop off drastically needed food and supplies.

The islands were liberated on May 9, 1945.
