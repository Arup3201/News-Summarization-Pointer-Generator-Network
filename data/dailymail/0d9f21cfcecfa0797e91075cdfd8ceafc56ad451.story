Former England defender and coach Stuart Pearce has left his wife of 20 years for an FA employee who once worked as a liaison officer for the WAGs.

A close family friend said yesterday that he feared Pearce had suffered a ‘complete mid-life crisis’ after walking out on his wife and two children to be with 39-year-old FA employee Carol Day.

‘Stuart told his wife Liz last month that he was leaving and he immediately moved out of the family home,’ said the friend.

‘He went straight to Carol’s flat in West London and the pair then went off on a holiday for a week.’

His affair adds another chapter to the FA’s  history of unfortunate romantic entanglements – not least the ‘kiss and tell’ affair involving former manager Sven Goran Eriksson and a secretary, Faria Alam, which also involved then FA chief Mark Palios.

Pearce, 51, is no longer an employee after losing his job as England Under-21 boss earlier this year.

He was nicknamed ‘Psycho’ during his career because of his uncompromising play, and his wife once said his ‘integrity and honesty are beyond doubt’.

But she is said to be shocked by his affair with Miss Day, who joined the Football Association in 1998 two years after completing a business administration and marketing degree at Brunel University.

Pearce told his wife that the relationship started after the European Under-21 Championships in Israel in June. England went out after losing all three group matches. ‘Liz does not know if Stuart is telling the truth or if the affair had been going on longer,’ said the family friend.

Miss Day was Players Wives Liaison Officer at the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and South Korea – arranging accommodation and flights for wives and girlfriends. More recently she has worked as operations manager for England’s junior teams – from Under-16 to Under-21. Pearce began managing the Under-21s in 2007.

Miss Day was also an organiser for the Great Britain football team at last year’s London Olympics – a team also managed by Pearce.

She is said to have told her FA bosses about the relationship.

Three years ago Pearce tried to motivate the Under-21 squad with a visit to Colchester barracks, where the players and staff met soldiers due to be deployed in Afghanistan.

The group later competed in tests conducted in a battle simulator and the winner was Miss Day.

‘From the 39 people on the coach, Carol – the only lady on board – got the top marks, so that doesn’t say much for the rest of them,’ Pearce said afterwards.

Pearce played more than 800 games – including 78 appearances for England – in a career that started at non-league Wealdstone.

In 2002 he embarked on a managerial career that included a spell as caretaker England manager last year when Fabio Capello resigned.

The Pearces wed in 1993. Mrs Pearce, 50, the daughter of a Wiltshire pig farmer, is not a stereotypical WAG. She is a keen horsewoman and keeps former racehorses at stables close to the £1.8million family home near Marlborough, Wiltshire.

She is credited with having sparked an interest in both the theatre and reading in her husband, who left school with five CSEs.

She is said to be ‘devastated’ by the break-up of her marriage.

‘She always thought he was not the sort of person to do what he has done,’ said the family friend.

The couple have two children – Chelsea, a talented rider tipped to represent Great Britain in eventing, and Harley. Pearce is currently on a Bear Grylls survival course, which was a present from them.

Pearce and Miss Day were unavailable for comment yesterday. Mrs Pearce refused to comment.
