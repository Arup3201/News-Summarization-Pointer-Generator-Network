A mysterious object launched by Russian military is being followed by Western space agencies over fears it could be part of a Kremlin project to kill satellites.

Object 2014-28E, which was tracked over Guatemala on Monday night by N2YO, has been making unusual movements according to amateur observers.  

The Financial Times reported that it has been moving towards other Russian space objects and is now being monitored by Norad - the U.S. Military's space defense command.

Mysterious objects: Object 2014-28E, which was tracked over Guatemala on Monday night by observers N2YO, has been making unusual movements according to amateur astronomers

The object had originally been classed as space debris, propelled into orbit as part of a Russian rocket launch in May to add three Rodnik communications satellites to an existing military constellation.

There are theories that it could be a civilian project used to pick up 'space junk' or could be a method of fixing broken orbiters.

However Russia did not declare the launch, prompting concerns it could be part of another objective.

Some believe that with the deterioration of West-Moscow relations and the revived interest in space weaponry, this could make strategic sense.  

The anti-satellite program launched under Stalin - known as Istrebitel Sputnikov - was closed down in 1989. 

 Patricia Lewis, research director at think-tank Chatham House, told the FT: 'It could have a number of functions, some civilian and some military. One possibility is for some kind of grabber bar.

'Another would be kinetic pellets which shoot out at another satellite. Or possibly there could be a satellite-to-satellite cyber attack or jamming.' 

However she added that: 'It would be odd if space were to remain the one area that [militaries] don’t get their hands on.'

Space race: Russia became the first nation to launch a satellite into oribit, with Sputnik 1 in 1957 

Russia became the first nation to put a satellite into orbit with the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957.

But the United States first put a man on the moon in 1969 and Russia has not yet done so. 

In 2007, two of Sputnik's heirs, Voyagers 1 and 2, are headed towards the edge of the Solar System after 30 years in space.

Six years later, they announced that they would be sending an unmanned probe to the Moon by 2015. 

The craft, called Luna-Glob, or Moon-Globe, will be carried by the first rocket to blast off from a new facility that Russia is building in its far eastern Amur region. 

The claims come the same week that Philae attempted to land on the surface of a comet. 

Rosetta's craft captivated the world when it touched down, but went into hibernation mode late on Friday when its primary battery ran out of power. 

Earlier this month, the International Space Station had to fly higher as to avoid Chinese space junk floating in orbit.  

Russia has a number of satellites in the solar system, and has over ambitious space projects in the pipeline - including sending an unmanned probe to the Moon by 2015
