Crime scene: Police say all three attacks took place at this home on Fender Drive in Lynnwood 

Neighbor Daniel Barton spotted the 29-year-old victim stumbling about in the 13800 block of Fender Drive and bleeding profusely from his neck and elbow, he told KIRO-TV.

Barton's girlfriend called 911 to summon paramedics, who then transported the victim to an area hospital to be treated for his injuries.

About 15 minutes later, police got a call from Ayling's grandmother, believed to be 65-year-old Darlene Nex, telling them that her grandson tried to slash her with a sword at a home in the 13700 of Fender Drive.

Ms Nex suffered only minor cuts and declined medical attention.

At around 9.30p, a 40-year-old man with a deep cut on his hand entered a Dollar Street on Mukilteo Speedway asking for help.

When police arrived on the scene, the victim told officers that he was attacked by a sword-wielding man.

Ayling's swordplay has sent two people to the hospital suffering from serious injuries
