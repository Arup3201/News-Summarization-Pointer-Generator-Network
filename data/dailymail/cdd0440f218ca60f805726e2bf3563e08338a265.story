Bail has been set at $6million for Megan Huntsman, a mother in Utah who was arrested Sunday after  police found the bodies of her six babies she has admitted to killing.

Huntsman, 39, told police she either strangled or suffocated six of her babies immediately after they were born. She wrapped their bodies in a towel or a shirt, put them in plastic bags and then packed them inside boxes in the garage of her home south of Salt Lake City.

The body of a seventh child was found in 
garage but it appears to have been stillborn, so she is not being 
charged in that death.

Huntsman was seen wearing a blue prison-issued jumpsuit during a closed circuit court appearance on Monday and alternated between covering her eyes and blinking, emotionless.

The Salt Lake Tribune reported that 
she starred blankly at Judge Steven Hansen when he told her that she was
 going to have her bail set at $6million because she is a 'flight risk 
and because of this heinous, horrible crime'.

'That's fine,' she said.

'This is a little shocking because of the number of babies that were killed,' Judge Buhman added.

While
 she has reportedly admitted that she gave birth and then killed the 
babies herself over the course of 10 years, she has not gone into any 
detail about why she did so.

According to a probable cause statement released by police Monday, Huntsman said she gave birth to at least seven babies between 1996 and 2006 at her former home in Pleasant Grove, a leafy, sleepy town about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City.

All but one of them was born alive, she said.

Hiding: Several people, including this person in sweat pants, were seen taking bags of items from the home where the grisly discovery was made on Sunday

Connections: Megan Huntsman is in jail but she and her estranged husband have three teenage and adult daughters, though the young woman seen leaving the home has not been identified

Her estranged husband, Darren West, made the discovery Saturday morning while cleaning out the garage of the house, which is owned by his parents.

He called Huntsman, who admitted to him it was her baby, according to court documents.

West called police, who then found the bodies in the garage.

Investigators believe Huntsman is the mother of them all based on what she has told them but have ordered DNA tests to make sure that's the case.

Huntsman's three daughters — one teenager and two young adults — also lived in the house.

It could take weeks to get the results, Utah County Attorney Jeff Buhman said.

Questions: Huntsman's youngest daughter, who is in junior high, was born during the same time period when she murdered her other babies and it is not clear why she was spared (an unidentified person pictured above at the family home on Monday)

'How can you have a baby and not have 
evidence and other people know?' asked neighbor SanDee Wall.

'You can't 
plan when a baby is going to come. Just the thought of somebody putting a
 baby into a box is a heartbreaker.'

Investigators believe West and Huntsman were together when the babies were born, but don't believe he was aware of the killings.

Buhman said Huntsman is the principle suspect, but didn't rule out more arrests as the investigation continues.

Police declined to discuss whether West or the three daughters have been interviewed.

Heartbreaking: Huntsman and her estranged husband had three daughters together and some items from their childhood were seen on the family's lawn as the investigation continued Monday

West pleaded guilty in federal court in 2005 to two counts of possessing chemicals intended to be used in manufacturing methamphetamine, according to court records.

In August 2006, he was sentenced to 9 years in prison, but appealed three times.

As he maintained his innocence, Huntsman wrote a letter asking a federal judge to consider leniency at sentencing.

'Darren is a remarkable man, husband, brother, son, son-in-law, friend and father of our three beautiful daughters,' she wrote, continuing,

'Please we need this guy to keep our family together.'

Neighbor Sharon Chipman said the couple married young, and Huntsman never worked except for a short stint at a grocery store.

The three daughters who were living in the house were good young women who have turned out remarkably well considering their father has been in prison, Chipman and Wall said.

West's parents have played an influential role in their upbringing, especially the youngest, who is still in junior high.

Wall said she's puzzled about why Huntsman would have killed the babies, especially considering her youngest daughter, now a young teen, was born during the decade Huntsman told authorities she killed the other babies.

'Why was one of them saved?' Wall said.

Most women who kill their children do so by neglect and or on purpose, such as Andrea Yates, the Texas woman who drowned her five children in her bathtub in 2001, said Cheryl Meyer, a psychology professor at Ohio's Wright State University.

Meyer said another common category is the 'concealer' — a woman who hides or denies her pregnancy and then seeks to dispose of the baby after it's born.

What she did: Huntsman has been charged with six counts of murder, but it is unclear why she has not been charged with seven since that many bodies were found

Meyer said the concealer is typically a teenager who does not repeat the act.

'These are usually girls who are 17, get pregnant, become scared to death and don't want to tell their parents,' said Meyer, who has written about mothers who kill their children.

'They're not 30-year-old women who can go have an abortion.'

To combat this, all states, including Utah, have safe haven laws that allow women to drop off unwanted newborns to authorities with no questions asked.

The mother can remain anonymous as long as the child has not been subject to abuse or neglect.

In coming days, defense attorneys for Huntsman are likely to closely examine her background to search for any evidence of mental illness or a family history that would help explain the alleged killings, said George Parnham, who represented Yates at her criminal trial.

Defense attorneys also will try to determine whether Huntsman sought an abortion and if she told anyone about her pregnancies — all in hopes of understanding actions that otherwise appear incomprehensible, Parnham said.

'You start off with the very nature of what happened. Is there a rational motive?' he said.
