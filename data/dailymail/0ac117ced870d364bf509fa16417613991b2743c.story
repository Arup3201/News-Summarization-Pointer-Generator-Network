Face to face: Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino held talks with the club's football staff on Monday

Leeds players were left furious after being forced to cut their holidays short on Monday for face-to-face meetings with new owner Massimo Cellino.

The businessman took the unusual step of calling the club’s football staff in for a series of meetings, with one player even flying in from a holiday in Dubai to attend the meeting.

Cellino was insistent on meeting his new employees individually, which meant some staff were left waiting for as long as two-and-a-half-hours for their meetings.

Players 
had hoped the talks would resolve many of the unresolved issues floating
 around Elland Road following the recent takeover and manager Brian 
McDermott’s sacking last week.

But
 members of the squad left the discussions feeling no clearer about their
 futures, despite having to interrupt their summer break.

A
 source said: ‘The players were expecting issues to be resolved but it 
wasn’t like that at all. Nothing was resolved - it was a shambles.

‘Some players were left waiting to see him for as long as two-and-a-half hours, it was like a doctors waiting room.

‘He told some of the players that he felt they were paid too much which obviously didn’t go down well at all.

‘He didn’t even get round to meeting all of the staff.’

Cellino’s next task will be appoint the club’s next manager following McDermott’s exit last week.

Gianluca Festa, David Hockaday and Benito Carbone are among the contenders to replace McDermott.
