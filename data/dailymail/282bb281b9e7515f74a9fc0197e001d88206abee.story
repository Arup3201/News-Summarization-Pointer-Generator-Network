No sooner had Sergio Aguero made a tearful exit from the Etihad Stadium than Manchester City were closing ranks to insist that they can prosper at home and abroad without their talismanic striker.

Aguero limped off with damaged ligaments in his left knee just 75 seconds into the 1-0 victory over Everton after tangling with Toffees midfielder Muhamed Besic.

City’s 19-goal top scorer is almost certainly out of Wednesday’s decisive Champions League showdown with Roma and, most likely, the majority of the busy festive programme after the Premier League champions won their fourth league game in a row to cut Chelsea’s lead at the top to three points.

53.1% - Scored or assisted 17 of City’s 32 Premier League goals this season (53.1 per cent).

7 - Aguero’s goals alone have won City seven points this season - more than any other player besides Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal), Christian Eriksen (Tottenham) and Charlie Austin (QPR).

2 - Without Aguero’s goals City would drop from second to fourth in the table on 26 points - 10 behind Chelsea. Their goal difference would also drop from +18 to +4.

4th - He also has the fourth-highest shot accuracy (60.71 per cent) and shot conversion rate (25 per cent) of all players with 20 shots or more.

Those who have, in recent weeks, questioned whether City are becoming a one-man team are about to get their answer.

With Stevan Jovetic injured and Edin Dzeko fit only to play the last half an hour from the bench, Manuel Pellegrini sent on Jose Angel Pozo in place of Aguero for only his second Premier League appearance.

The decision to allow Alvaro Negredo to return to Spain on loan with Valencia last summer without signing a replacement now seems more curious than ever.

James Milner, who won the penalty that enabled Yaya Toure to score the decisive goal, said: ‘People can say whatever they want if they think we’re a one-man team. Some people have been saying Chelsea had won the league 10 games in and here we are with a three-point gap.

‘Losing Aguero will be a big miss. He is a world-class player, one of the best on the planet, and has been absolutely outstanding so the injury has come at a bad time.

James Milner was the fifth most-appreciated player in the Premier League on the new High5it app this weekend - voted for exclusively be fans. 

'Sergio is very, very difficult to replace but we have a lot of firepower. With the players we do have up there I’m not too worried.

‘Edin coming back is a positive and he’s a fantastic goalscorer. Hopefully Stevan should be available (for Roma) as well. We have a fantastic squad of players.’

City’s task in Rome will not be easy. Toure is suspended and Vincent Kompany is a major doubt. David Silva is back in training and City are more optimistic that he can return after missing eight games with a knee injury.

Jovetic and Fernandinho face late fitness tests. After Aguero’s hat-trick heroics against Bayern Munich last month revived their Champions League hopes, City must get at least a draw in the Stadio Olimpico to have a chance of reaching the last 16.

Milner added: ‘We will go there to win. It won’t be easy - Roma are a good team and I’m sure it will be a great atmosphere.

‘I’ve played in Italy before with City and England and you get a hostile atmosphere. You look at the experience we have in this squad, and that sort of atmosphere won’t bother anybody.

‘Personally, I love it when you hear the boos and whistles. It makes you raise your game. In previous seasons we have proved that, when we know what we have to do to win - like we did with our two league titles - we can do it. It could be a great European tie.’

Everton boss Roberto Martinez was furious after Ross Barkley received his second caution for diving in two weeks. He felt that Frank Lampard’s tackle on the young midfielder was no different to Phil Jagielka’s clash with Milner which resulted in the penalty.

‘I couldn’t believe the yellow card,’ said the Everton manager. ‘The penalty was two bodies coming together and then you see the same action, but because Ross Barkley is involved he gets a yellow card. It’s so inconsistent and disappointing.’
