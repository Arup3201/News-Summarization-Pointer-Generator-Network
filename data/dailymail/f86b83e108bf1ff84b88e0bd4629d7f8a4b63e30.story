Tony Pulis believes Manuel Pellegrini’s job as Manchester City manager will be under threat if he fails to land a trophy this season.

The West Bromwich Albion head coach insisted City must continue to be successful over the next five years to earn the global fan base of rival clubs.

'The pressure is he has to win, given the amount of money Man City have invested in players over the past years,’ said Pulis. ‘I don’t think it’s just at the top, it’s at the bottom. We’ve seen it with Gus (Poyet), there comes a tipping point. There is always a tipping point at the top and bottom. That’s the industry we’re in.

'They pay the money for results. It’s a results business.' He added: 'All over the world there are supporters following the Premier League. A lot of fair weather supporters. Of the new generation, 99.9 per cent will pick a team that’ s been successful. 

'So Man City need to be successful over the next four or five years to get a generation of supporters, like Liverpool did, like Man United did. Those big clubs need that support, it’s money in the bank for them.' Pulis takes his side to the Etihad believing Pellegrini’s team will be at their most threatening, however, following their Champions League defeat to Barcelona.

He thinks City can win all their remaining nine matches to mount a Premier League title challenge and that the only difference in the Nou Camp was Lionel Messi.

'I think City now will be at their most dangerous,’ said Pulis. ‘Coming out of the Champions League I think they’ll really focus on their last nine games. The attitude at that football club will be: “Can we win nine?" It’s up to us to go and give them a good game.

'You look at their squad, they have enough to win nine games. If they do, who knows? I’m sure they’re talking about it. They are that good a group.

'We talk about playing against Barcelona, they are one player short in that game: Messi. He was the difference.

'He's a game changer at the very highest level of his profession and that's the difference. I'm absolutely convinced if you put him in City's team they would be through now, not Barcelona.’
