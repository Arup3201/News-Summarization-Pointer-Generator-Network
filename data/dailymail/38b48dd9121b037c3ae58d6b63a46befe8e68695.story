A 30-year-old woman claiming benefits, who weighs nearly 22 stone, says she'd love to work but employers won't give her a chance because of her size.

Kirsty Kennedy, from Stirling, has been on the dole for seven years and gets £500 a month in welfare handouts while she tries to find a job.

'I have applied for Poundland, I think Iceland are getting fed up of me asking all the time. I'm just getting to the point where I will take anything.

'People look at me and think she's too heavy, we cannot take her,' she said on Channel 5 show Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole.

The documentary follows Kirsty as she trawls Stirling city centre dropping off her CV in stores so she can be considered for work. But she's not hopeful because of her 21st 11lb size.

She said: 'I'm not exactly Twiggy but I'm here and willing to learn if you give me a try. It feels like they take one look and me and say "you're not getting a job".'

Kirsty still lives at home with her parents Rosie, 57, and Des, 63.

They also get £500 a month benefits as overweight Des has type 2 diabetes and is unable to work because of his poor health, and Rosie gets a carer's allowance for looking after her husband.

The couple gave their daughter a Nissan Micra car and would love her to pass her driving test and get a job.

Kirsty's parents also claim benefits as her father, Des, right, is unable to work due to his health and her mother, Rosie, left, acts as his carer

Rosie said of her daughter: 'She needs to learn to concrete and start listening.' 

Speaking to Kirsty, she said: 'If you're not earning, why is that car sitting out there?' 

Kirsty, who has a mild learning disorder, said she wants to be able to drive so she can widen her employment opportunities but she has failed her driving theory test five times.

She said: 'I just get confused with directions. If someone gave me a map and told me to get to a place and go left, then right, I'll go the opposite to what they have told me.'

Kirsty is enrolled on a Scottish work programme in order to gain her benefits which involves doing shifts for a charity dealing out food.

Her participation in the programme means she qualifies for gym access which she has been using to try and lose weight.

She currently has a Body Mass Index of 55 - which classes her as 'very severely obese' as healthy BMI is between 18.5 to 25.

Kirsty admitted to her gym instructor that she has 'my good days and my bad days' when it comes to sticking to a diet.

She explained: 'Bad days are one too many packets of crisps, a bit too much chocolate.'

Kirsty, pictured here,  said employers often don't take her seriously because of her size

Her instructor said she will lose weight if she remains committed to a diet and consistently exercises three times a week. 

But Kirsty told the Daily Record that she needs more support to lose weight.

She said: 'I know what I should be doing to lose weight. But I think I need someone to be firm with me. Not too hard on me - but just enough to tell me what I should be doing.

'I need someone to be a mentor. I have been under dieticians in the past and my weight has been like a yo-yo. It's difficult to keep it going in the right direction.'

Kirsty is convinced that if she wasn't overweight she would get a job - but she admits she's not sure if she could cope with working full-time as being on the dole is all she's known.

She said: 'I think I would struggle with a full-time job. I have never had one. I think I would struggle physically and mentally.'
