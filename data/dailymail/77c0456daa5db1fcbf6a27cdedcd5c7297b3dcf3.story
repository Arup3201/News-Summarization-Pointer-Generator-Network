It seems Elin Nordegren just cannot escape her ex-husband Tiger Wood's army of alleged mistresses.

The 31-year-old may not know it yet, but her new beau appears to have much more in common with Tiger than just a fondness for pretty Swedish blondes.

Yesterday it was reported that Elin, a former model, had found love again with Jamie Dingman, a successful American investor and businessman.

Now comes word that Jamie, who has 
previously been linked to Princess Madeleine of Sweden and American actress Bridget Moynahan, also has a penchant for leggy ladies with sordid pasts.

According to entertainment website TMZ, Jamie whose father is billionaire businessman Michael Dingman, used to date Rachel Uchitel, Tiger's alleged 'mistress number one.'

Sources tell the website that at the time the Tiger cheating scandal broke, Jamie was living with Rachel, a former Nightclub hostess in a Miami home.

TMZ also claims Rachel left Jamie when 
things started to heat up with Tiger, but the wealthy investor wasn't 
exactly broken up over the split and told Rachel: 'That's ok. I'll 
date his wife, Elin.'

Jamie splits his time between China and the Bahamas where his father’s Shipston Group company is based.

But despite his jet setting lifestyle, it appears he has still had time to visit Elin in her native Sweden.

It has also been said the pair first met at the Red Cross Ball in Florida last January attended by Princess Madeleine.

Family: Elin seen with her children Sam and Charlie last year after she divorced their father Tiger Woods

Elin divorced golf ace Woods after it emerged that he had been involved in a considerable number of extra-martial affairs which came to light in December 2009.

Although she initially stood by him amidst the claims, she eventually filed for divorce and the couple’s marriage ended in August 2010.

The pair have two children together Sam, three, and two-year-old Charlie.

Elin, who walked away with $100million as part of her 
divorce settlement from Woods, is said to have been dating Jamie for months.
