A 36-year-old teacher at an Indiana high school was arrested Friday after police found him naked inside of his vehicle with a 17-year-old student.

Tim Guilfoy, a girls golf coach and English teacher at Greenwood Community High School near Indianapolis, admitted to arresting officers that he and the girl - who is one of his students - were having sex.

About midnight Friday, officers from the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department were investigating a sispicious vehicle parked in the 8800 block of South Madison Avenue. When they approached the vehicle, officers found Guilfoy and the girl naked inside of his GMC Sierra pickup truck.

'When asked what they were doing, Guilfoy told 
the officer they were having sex,' IMPD Lieutenant Christopher Bailey said in a statement. 'Guilfoy also told officers he was a teacher at Greenwood High School 
and that the female inside the truck was one of his students.'

Guifoy was arrested at the scene and taken to Marion County Jail on a preliminary charge of child seduction. He posted $7,500 bond and was released from jail on Sunday.

According to the school district, Guilfoy resigned from his position at the school on Sunday, shortly after getting bailed out of jail.

'Greenwood
 Community School Corp. officials intend to fully cooperate with law 
enforcement authorities in their investigation,' school Superintendent Kent DeKoninck said in a statement. 'The 
school district will have no further comment at this time.'

Guilfoy has been with the district since 2000, and is certified to teach both physical education and English.

Guilfoy likely will face additional charges once the Marion County Prosecutor's Office reviews the case.

He is scheduled to make an initial court appearance on Wednesday.
