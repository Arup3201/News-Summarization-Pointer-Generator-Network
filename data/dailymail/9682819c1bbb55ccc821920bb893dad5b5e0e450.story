Fifty Ways To Play: BDSM For Nice People is the surprise new release from HarperCollins

Just one year ago we would never have imagined that a mainstream publishing company like HarperCollins would dream of releasing a guide to bondage bedroom play - or BDSM, as it is known to the initiated.

BDSM is a catch-all abbreviation that brings together the predilections for bondage and discipline (B/D), dominance and submission (D/s), and sadomasochism or sadism and masochism.

While it is a lifestyle choice enjoyed, sometimes to extremes, by people across the globe, it is fair to say that the current popularity of BDSM refers to a sort of 'BDSM lite' - a tamer, more approachable version of the sexual proclivity.

And that is just what is portrayed in HarperCollins' new guide. The book, Fifty Ways To Play - which carries the subtitle BDSM for nice people.

The publisher bills the book, by husband and wife duo Debra and Don Macleod as A Beginner's Guide To Unleashing Your Erotic Desires - and it is enough to have the more buttoned-up readers blushing into their blindfolds.

Fifty Ways To Play claims to offer 50 'edgy and erotic' adventures which the publisher says are 'perfect for the millions of readers who have been inspired by the phenomenal Fifty Shades trilogy.'

'Fifty Shades has broken down the taboos about BDSM and more women than ever are wanting to spice up their sex lives,' HarperCollins said. 'But there is very little out there that shows you how to turn every night into an erotic fantasy.

'From turning your bedroom into a 'Red Room Of Desire [in the book it is known as the Red Room Of Pain] to exploring the fine art of Japanese rope bondage, these 50 edgy and erotic adventures make incredible sex incredibly easy,' they say.

Conveniently for the budding BDSM-er, the book is being packaged up and sold as part of erotic gift sets by boxofgrey.com, a website set up for newcomers to the BDSM world.

They have created gift boxes with a selection of props to complement the book, with two different sets on offer to assist the BDSM virgins: the Play Box, which includes a blindfold, paddle, kegel balls and a rope kit, and the Summer Holiday box, which contains a holiday-friendly selection of products that the site says are discreet enough that they can be packed in hand luggage without arousing suspicions during security checks.
