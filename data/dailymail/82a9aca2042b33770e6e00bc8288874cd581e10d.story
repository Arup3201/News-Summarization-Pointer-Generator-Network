You could literally fry an egg on the tarmac at the Sepang circuit on Friday. The mercury nudged 140°F, but it is the steam-room humidity rather than the pure heat that will make Sunday's grand prix such a soppy, sapping and exhausting test of survival.

Drivers will lose just under 7lb during the 90-minute race. For McLaren’s Jenson Button, preparation has included a week at the Thanyapura training facility, exercising outside rather than in the gym to acclimatise to the conditions.

‘Jenson will wear a cool vest before he gets into the car,’ explained Button’s physio Mike Collier. ‘It’s like an ice pack you would put into a cool box.

‘If you have as much as a 10 per cent reduction in body weight during the race, you get the effects of heat stroke — loss of vision and lack of reactions. We want to keep it to under a five per cent reduction.

‘So he will have a pre-race drink made up of carbohydrates, electrolytes — minerals such as sodium — and protein.

‘His supply for the race is contained in a kind of bladder. It is one of the last things to go into the car to keep it as cold as possible for as long as possible. 

'He will get the drink by pressing the drinks button on the steering wheel. It goes through a series of tubes and through a hole in his balaclava into his mouth.

‘The drink will get extremely hot as the race goes on but it will still be beneficial to him.

‘He will then have a recovery drink over the four to six hours after the race. It is a slightly different composition — higher in carbohydrates, proteins and fats.’
