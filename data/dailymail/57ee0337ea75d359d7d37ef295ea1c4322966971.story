One of the funniest items on sale is an old mobile phone from China which he has put up for 50 cents without a charger. And while he acknowledges it has bad reception and no internet, he does add that the price is negotiable.  

Mr Wilson told Daily Mail Australia 'the phone is an unknown brand'.

This microwave is also up for sale for $2- Mr Wilson says it 'works really well' but is rusty inside

Despite its bad looks Mr Wilson insists the microwave is an 'excellent little beast' but is 'missing a knob' 

He says: 'I have carpentry qualifications and also automotive qualifications. 

'I am however just looking for grunt work for physical exercise, Eg- concreting, painting, digging a ditch, I would like to work locally though, and get paid in cash.'

He said: 'I am a good worker and a good looking bloke, I don't know why nobody will employ me.'  

Another item for sale is rusty old Daewoo microwave which is on sale for $2.

He says on the site: 'Old microwave has some rust inside it, have had this microwave for seven years it works really well, a little bit of rust killer I can give you the rust killer, all you would need is a spot of white paint, its missing a knob on the front, but this microwave is an excellent little beast 800watt.'
