The recent news that animals were abused during wild late night parties at London Zoo is just the most recent example of why animal conservationists may need need to rethink their strategy on keeping animals in captivity.

Zoos across the world vary widely in the standards of welfare they offer creatures, and indeed many people believe that keeping animals in enclosures at all is an outdated concept that should be scrapped.

But now a group of Danish architects has come up with a zoo design that could allow people to safely watch animals, without the creatures ever feeling like they’re imprisoned.

Even if you love going to the zoo, seeing an animal in captivity and out of their natural habitat can be upsetting.Now a group of Danish architects has come up with a zoo design (pictured) that could allow people to safely watch animals, without the creatures ever feeling like they’re imprisoned

In this Zootopia, the humans are hidden from animals in shelters and mirrored pods, while the animals roam around a huge 300 acre complex divided into continents.

The Bjarke Ingels Group design, which is still in its very early stages, has been put forward for the 50-year-old Givskud Zoo in Denmark, according to a report by Becky Quintal in Arch Daily.

These continents can be accessed by visitors using ramps, bridges, and tunnels hidden in the ground. They would then be able to hide inside shelters, pods and hollowed logs as the animals pass by.

At the heart of the design is a huge swooping circular plaza that lets people climb up to look down on the parkland.

This also allows visitors to get access to a trio of the zoo's three habitats: Africa, Asia, and the Americas. 

The entire zoo is ringed by an elevated walkway and a 2.5 mile-long hike connects all three continents. 

Particulars of the design are still to be confirmed and its unclear exactly how far the barriers between animals and visitors will be broken down. This image suggests the barriers will be minimal, allowing humans to come close to the animals, without the animals feeling like they are being watched

It is touted as a wild night out. But parties at London Zoo are becoming a little too wild.

Drunken revellers have been taunting and abusing the animals at Zoo Lates events, which are held on Friday nights over the summer.

Incidents include a woman punching a bird, a male pouring beer on a tiger, a reveller stripping off before entering the penguin enclosure and butterflies squashed underfoot.

There are also claims that a drunken woman tried to get into the lion enclosure.The animals are said to have been disturbed by loud noise and flash photography at the parties. 

To keep people safe, the architects believe visitors could travel by bike, which would have spherical mirrors attached to keep them hidden.

Other ideas include having huge spheres hung from tension cables over bears, lions and or travelling by boat alongside elephants.

‘We must make sure that our cities offer a generous framework for different people – from different backgrounds, economy, gender, culture, education and age – so they can live together in harmony while taking into account individual needs as well as the common good,’ the company writes on its website.

‘Nowhere is this challenge more acrimonious than in a zoo.

'It is our dream – with Givskud – to create the best possible and freest possible environment for the animals' lives and relationships with each other and visitors.’

Others particulars of the design are still to be confirmed and its unclear exactly how far the barriers between animals and visitors will be broken down.

The design is currently early initial master plan for an overhaul of the part that's scheduled to be completed by 2019.
