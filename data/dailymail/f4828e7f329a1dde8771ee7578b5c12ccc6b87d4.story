The father of one of the Navy SEALs who was killed in the Libya consulate raid has launched another attack on President Obama's handling of the crisis, saying: 'It's better to die the death of a hero than it is to live the life of a coward.'

Charles Woods, father of Tyrone Woods, revealed his suspicion that Obama was 'responsible for the death of my son' - but he insisted he was not angry at the President.

He previously made headlines when he slammed Joe Biden for acting inappropriately during the repatriation ceremony for his son's body.

Criticism: Mr Woods had harsh words for President Obama over his response to the attack

Tyrone died on September 11 alongside
his colleague Glen Doherty while the pair were protecting a CIA 
building next to the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.

Ambassador Chris Stevens and diplomat
Sean Smith were also killed in the raid, which has become a 
controversial issue in next month's presidential election due to ongoing
confusion over how much the administration knew about the circumstances
of the attack.

Speaking to Geraldo Rivera on Fox 
News on Monday, Mr Woods returned to his criticism of the 
administration, arguing that the consulate raid was in fact 'an attack 
on American soil' and merited a more forceful military response.

Addressing the President directly, he
asked: 'If this attack on American citizens, on American soil, happened
2,000 miles away from Washington DC - say in Los Angeles or in Seattle -
would you have waited seven hours before you sent the first airplane?

'Would you have waited seven hours until the attack was over?'

Cold: Charles Woods also criticised Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton for their demeanour when they met him

However, Mr Woods denied that he was motivated by bitterness, saying: 'First of all, I am not angry at all.

'In fact, Mr President, if I had the 
opportunity of speaking to you face to face, and I would really love to,
I would say this: Mr President, I respect your office. However, if you 
are responsible for the death of my son, I totally forgive you.

'This is about honor, courage and 
about love for America. And remember this, Mr President: my son and the 
others died heroes, and it's better to die the death of a hero than it 
is to live the life of a coward.

'If you are responsible for the death of my son, I forgive you, I love you. I also love America.'

Mr Woods last week told Glenn Beck 
that he was disappointed by his meeting with senior officials at the 
event marking the return of the dead men's bodies.

He
said that Biden had acted inappropriately, asking the Woods family in a
'loud and boisterous' tone, 'Did your son always have balls the size of
cue balls?' Mr Woods asked, 'Are these the words of someone who is sorry?'

The President, by contrast, was apparently much more subdued, to the point of coldness.

'When he finally came over to where 
we were, I could tell that he was rather conflicted, a person who was 
not at peace with himself,' Mr Woods said.

'Shaking
hands with him, quite frankly, was like shaking hands with a dead fish.
His face was pointed towards me but he would not look me in the eye, 
his eyes were over my shoulder.

'I could tell that he was not sorry. He had no remorse.'

When
Mr Woods met Hillary Clinton, she made a reference to the U.S.-made 
YouTube video mocking the Prophet Muhammad which was originally thought 
to have been behind the attack.

'When she said that, I could tell that she was not telling me the truth,' he said.

Aftermath: The events leading up to the raid are still under official investigation six weeks later

His recollection of the reception differs sharply from that of Tyrone's mother, who last month took to Facebook to praise the officials who organised the event.

Writing about the repatriation of her son's body, Cheryl Croft Bennett said: 'The entire afternoon was overpowering and unreal.

'Little did I know that I would find myself in a reception room being comforted, hugged, and, yes, even kissed by the President of the United States. Along with the President, there was Vice-President Joe Biden, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, and General and Mrs Colin Powell.

'They were all wonderful. They held my hand, offered condolences, gave warm hugs, and were extremely compassionate and genuinely sad for my loss, as I fought back tears and tried to project an image of strength to honor my SEAL son.'

Mr Woods also denounced the White House for officials' failure to protect the four Americans, saying: 'They denied the pleas for help and they watched my son die.'

Fallen: Diplomat Sean Smith, left, and SEAL Glen Doherty, right, were the other two American victims

In a statement he described Tyrone as 'a true American hero' who had 'voluntarily sacrificed his life to protect the lives of other Americans'.

He called for further investigation of the circumstance of the attack, concluding: 'This is an opportunity for the person or persons who made the decision to sacrifice my son's life to stand up.'

This is not the first time a parent of one of the victims has publicly spoken out against the President's handling of the tragedy.

Sean Smith's mother Pat has slammed Obama for describing the situation as 'not optimal', telling MailOnline, 'It's 
insensitive to say my son is not very optimal - he is also very dead.'

She added: 'I am still waiting for the truth to 
come out and I still want to know the truth. I'm finally starting to get
some answers but I won't give up.'

The Benghazi raid has become one of the most divisive issues in the presidential battle between Obama and his Republican opponent Mitt Romney.

GOP congressmen have accused the White House and the State Department of misleading the nation by pinning the attack on the anti-Islam video, entitled Innocence of Muslims, when there were early signs that it had been a premeditated terrorist operation.

In addition, government officials have been criticised for scaling back security in Benghazi over the summer, despite Stevens' concerns about his safety and that of his team.
