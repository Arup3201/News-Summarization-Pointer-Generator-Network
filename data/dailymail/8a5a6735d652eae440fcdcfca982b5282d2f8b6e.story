Around 200 mysterious stone structures have mystified experts since they were discovered in the Gobi Desert in 2003.

Known as the ‘strange stone circles’ by locals in Turpan, the formations vary in size and shape with one intricate example resembling the sun.

And now an expert has suggested they could have been used by primitive nomads to worship the sun, and may have even been a site where sacrifices were made - although the types of sacrifices is not known.

Around 200 mysterious stone circles have mystified experts since they were discovered in the Gobi Desert in 2003. The largest structure in this image is known as the sun circle. An expert has suggested they could have been used by nomads to worship the sun, and may have even been a site where sacrifices were made

There are similarities between the Chinese stones and Stonehenge in Wiltshire.

This includes the formations being linked with sun worshippers, the shape of the structures including so-called 'exits', and the fact the stones were transported to the site from outside the region. 

The circles are located in the Flaming Mountain in Turpan, north west China and cover more than two-and-a-half square miles (6.6 square km).

They have been filmed from above using a drone by a local tourism association, in an attempt to further understand the structures and their origins, People’s Daily Online reported.

Experts said that the stone circles are in line with local historical traditions but very little is known about them, including their age.

Some people had assumed that they were burial sites and attempted to dig them up. 

The mysterious collection of circles and squares have been filmed from above using a drone by a local tourism association, in an attempt to further understand the structures and their origins. A aerial shot is shown. If they were used as sacrificial sites, the type of sacrifices is not known

The circles are located in the Flaming Mountain in Turpan, north west China, a matter of miles from Lianmuqin town (marked) and cover more than two-and-a-half square miles (6.6 square km)

Similar formations were found in Burkhan Khaldun mountain in north Mongolia and archaeologists have even suggested these Mongolian rocks could help pinpoint the location of Genghis Khan's tomb. 

This view is shared by Dr Volker Heyd, an archaeologist at the University of Bristol.

He told MailOnline: 'First of all, they are man-made; there is no doubt about it.

'I have seen similar features in neighbouring Mongolia where they are well known too [and] they are regarded as ritual features.

One particular stone circle is known as the ‘Sun Circle’ (pictured) and is formed by four concentric circles, the largest of which measures 26 ft (eight metres) in diameter, with the smallest inner ring destroyed

The stone structures are built on high points of the land and some are square, with ‘exits’ to combine certain shapes (pictured). A lack of evidence of bodies at the sites has led one expert to rule out that the formations are burial sites, instead claiming they were sacrificial worship sites for ancient nomadic people

No-one is sure what the mysterious stone 'walls' were used for.

Some people thought they may be ancient burial sites, but no bodies have been found nearby and the soil beneath the circles and squares is said to be undisturbed.

The largest of the shapes, which features four concentric circles may have been the focus of sacrifices to a sun god.

Dr Volker Heyd, an archaeologist at the University of Bristol said its likely the structures are burial sites.  

But a local unnamed expert believes they were used for making sacrifices to the sun god thousands of years ago.

There is no precise date for the structure, but Dr Heyd added the first of these Gobi stone structures might date back as early as the Bronze Age. 

Although the more complex formations are likely 'younger and could have been constructed until the Medieval period.' 

'Some might have served as surface marking of burial places. 

At least in Mongolia, excavations have occasionally found graves in the centre of such features. 

'Others, if not the majority might denote holy places in the landscape, or places with special spiritual properties, or ritual offering/meeting places.'

He continued that the first of these Gobi stone structures might date back as early as the Bronze Age. 

This could make them up to 4,500 years old. 

Although the more complex formations are likely 'younger and could have been constructed until the Medieval period.'

However, a local specialist told Yahoo this is unlikely because the soil beneath them is undisturbed.

The stone formations are built on high points of the land and some are square, with ‘exits’.

One particular stone circle is known as the ‘Sun Circle’ and is formed by four concentric circles - the largest of which measures 26 ft (eight metres) in diameter, with the smallest inner ring destroyed.

On the southeast of the Sun Circle there are a multiple circles of different sizes.

Because of the shape of this particular circle, and a lack of evidence of bodies at the sites, the unnamed local expert told Yahoo the circles were likely to have been sacrificial worship sites for ancient nomadic people - although he didn’t elaborate on what may have been sacrificed.

The stone circles have been compared to Stonehenge in Wiltshire (pictured), whose origins and purpose remains largely a mystery, with some experts suggesting it too was used to worship the sun

The rocks used in the structures in China (pictured) are not from the desert where the circles are located, suggesting that they were brought from afar, much like Stonehenge’s famous bluestones

'Across central Asia these circles are usually sacrificial sites,’ he said. ‘We can image that this was a site for worshipping the god of the sun.'

He explained that the circles are all located on higher ground, which fits the selection conditions for ancient worship ceremonies.

Scattered across Jordan are 12 giant circular structures that can only be fully seen using aerial and satellite images.

Known collectively as the Big Circles, the vast rings - which range from between 720ft and 1,490ft (220 metres to 455 metres) in diameter - were first spotted from the air in the 1920s, and surveys in 1930, 1953 and 2002 have since revealed more details about their size, shape and locations.

Archaeologists from Western Australia have documented 12 of them to try and learn more about their purpose.

A total of eight big circles have been recorded in west central Jordan, between the Wadi el-Hasa and the edge of the Shara escarpment. There is also a second group, made of four Big Circles, just north of Azraq Oasis. Pictured is circle J1, known locally as Qasr Abu el-Inaya. It is located 2.4 miles (4km) west of the Hedjaz Railway and Desert Highway

There are eight Big Circles in west central Jordan, a second group, made of four Big Circles just north of Azraq Oasis. Plus, a more recent Big Circle spotted in 2002 near Homs in Syria.

Like the mysterious structures in China, their construction is simple and typically consists of low walls of uncut boulders.

However, they are incredibly precise and because they are so large, would have involved teams of workers.

Professor David Kennedy from the university, said an ‘architect’ would have plotted the circles using rope tied to a post in the centre

‘Some show signs of greater care with stones at least roughly shaped and laid in courses’ he added.

Dating is also said to be problematic, but there is often material in or around the circles that originated in the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age (between 2,000 to 4,500BC).

A number of the circles contain later material, typically dating to the Roman period between 1st and 7th century BC.

In another parallel, the rocks at the site in China are not from the desert where the circles are located, suggesting that they were brought from afar, just like Stonehenge’s famous bluestones.

The sun circle itself is made from over 200 of these mysterious stones. 

Although not identical, due to their much more complex design, geoglyphs in Peru have equally baffled experts about the practices of ancient groups. 

More commonly known as the Nazca Lines, they were first spotted in 1939 when a pilot flew over the Nasca planes of the Peruvian coastal highlands.

They were designated as a Unesco World Heritage Site in 1994 and the area stretches more than 50 miles (80km) between the towns of Nazca and Palpa, about 400 km south of Lima.

Contrary to the popular belief that the figures can only be seen from the air, they are actually visible from the surrounding foothills.

Paul Kosok, from Long Island University, is credited as the first scholar to seriously study the Nazca Lines.

He discovered that the lines converged at the winter solstice in the Southern Hemisphere.

Along with Maria Reiche, a German mathematician and archaeologist, Kosok proposed the figures were markers on the horizon to show where the sun and other celestial bodies rose.
