'Couldn't be bothered to pay': Russell Brand claims that he jumped the barriers to avoid paying the train fare from London to Chelmsford, Essex

Multimillionaire comedian Russell Brand has made a fresh bid to bolster his revolutionary image... by boasting that he dodged a train fare.

The comedian has admitted jumping the barrier on a journey from London to Chelmsford in Essex, saving him from a £14.90 hit to his estimated £15million fortune.

He claimed that he didn't make the effort to pull out his credit card at the ticket office because he 'couldn't be bothered with the rigmarole of getting one'.

Brand has come under fire for his vocal espousal of revolutionary socialist politics while enjoying a luxury lifestyle including stays at the Savoy in London and the purchase of a sumptuous home in the Hollywood Hills.

He claims that his vast wealth has not changed him.

The Mirror quoted the 38-year-old as saying: 'From someone that's gone from no wealth to wealth, I know that money doesn't make me happier. Like I jumped the train yesterday when I had to go to Chelmsford.

'I could have got a ticket but I couldn't be bothered with the rigmarole of getting of getting one.

'I realised all I had to do was get over a barrier so I did that and then slid out the other end behind someone.'

Brand's self-alleged act of civil disobedience is just the latest in a line of anti-establishment arguments and claims he has spouted in recent months.

But commentators say the comedian's professed enthusiasm for revolutionary anarchism and the overthrow of the capitalist economic system is a poor fit for his own money making schemes.

The Daily Mail's Paul Scott revealed last November how Brand - who has called for an end to 'massive economic disparity' - has been trying to court 'high-net-worth' investors into stumping up cash for a new film, with the company behind the scheme highlighting the potential 60 per cent tax breaks for those getting involved.

'Why vote? We know it's not going to make any difference': Brand's political activism has led to charges of hypocrisy, given that he enjoys a luxury lifestyle including a mansion in Hollywood and stays at the Savoy

In the UK, Brand is the director of 
three separate entertainment companies, Mayfair Film Partnership, the 
colourfully titled Pablo Diablo’s Legitimate Business Firm, and another 
called One Arm Bandit Limited.

Mayfair
 turned over more than £1.5million last year, making close to £800,000 
for its shareholders. Latest accounts for the latter two firms, 
meanwhile, show they turned over more than £370,000 last year, which 
means Brand’s British businesses alone grossed close to £2million.

Meanwhile,
 the wannabe movie mogul, who still commands fees of around £5million 
for acting roles in Hollywood, has been settling in to a five-bedroom 
mansion in Hollywood that was once owned by Lawrence Olivier and, from 
its commanding hillside position, boasts stunning views of the twinkling
 lights of Los Angeles arrayed below.

And
 when he returns to Britain to foment revolution, he has been often seen
 staying at the Savoy hotel on the Strand, that well-known doss house 
and hotbed of anti-establishment sentiment close to Waterloo Bridge.

Despite such apparent hypocrisies, Brand remains a darling of the Left and an icon to the young, many of whom feel disenfranchised by the homogeneity of political views expressed by the Westminster political machine and identify with the comedian's call for drastic political change.

A poll by the House of Commons' own Committee on Standards in Public Life found that four in 10 people feel so alienated by politicians that they might not bother voting - with many giving reasons that resonated with Brand's own argument that he has never voted because he regards politicians as untrustworthy and irrelevant.

Last November, Brand told the BBC's flagship Newsnight political programme: 'I'm angry, because for me its real. this is what I come from... there is going to be a revolution.

'Don't bother voting. Stop voting stop pretending, wake up, be in reality now. Why vote? We know it's not going to make any difference.'

A spokesman for Greater Anglia, which runs the London to Chelmsford route, declined to comment on Brand's claim, but said: 'We take fare evasion very seriously as it is in the interest of everyone who travels.'
