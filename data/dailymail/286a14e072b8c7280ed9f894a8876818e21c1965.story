Hoyn discovered the practice when she visited the Thailand in 2011 and was shocked to discover it was on offer as a form of entertainment at a competition near the capital Bangkok.

After watching the full-contact sport she decided to research the practice further and spent four weeks with the children at their home, during training, and at competitions.

Ms Hoyn said: 'The most shocking thing for me was to see the pressure on these children.

Fights: She said that in Thailand it isn¿t really unusual to see organised child fights

'They are the instrument for the parents to earn money, and they have to win the fight because the parents bet a lot of money on them. A lot of people lose all their money in one night.'

Ms Hoyn said that although money bets are illegal in Thailand, they do not seem to be enforced.

In Thai culture Muay Thai is a part of life and boys and girls train from an early age and it is not uncommon that children as young as these take part in tournaments in front of hundreds of spectators.

Captive audience: Children watch as their siblings and friends take part in a fight in the ring

Real: A young girl is kitted out in fighting gear. These little fighters are upholding a centuries old tradition and despite their young age, the fight is very real

Ambition: Many children are sent by parents from the rural regions in northeastern Thailand to Bangkok and other major cities to training camps in the hopes that their sons will become good fighters and be able to help the family financially

It is the country’s national sport and is to Thailand what football is to England, with leagues and successful fighters being treated like celebrities, which is what many of these youngsters hope to become.

Many children are sent by parents from the rural regions in northeastern Thailand to Bangkok and other major cities to training camps in the hopes that their sons will become good fighters and be able to help the family financially. 

Televised fights are the most popular shows on television and the streets empty when big fights are being held, in villages all over the country people cluster around any available television.

The popular sport is deeply entwined with the country’s history and was developed centuries ago as a way for Thai men to a way to defend themselves without using weapons.

Never-ending invasions from neighbouring countries in the early days of the Kingdom saw the people of Thailand rely on hand-to-hand combat to defend their land.

Muay Thai is also called the 'Art of Eight Limbs' or the 'Science Of Eight Limbs' as it uses eight points of contacts: hands, elbows, knees and feet when punching and kicking.

The word Muay derives from mavya, a word meaning ‘to bind together’ in Sanskrit.
