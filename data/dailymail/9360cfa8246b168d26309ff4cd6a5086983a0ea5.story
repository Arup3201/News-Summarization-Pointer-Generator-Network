Maria Sharapova survived an attritional battle against Romania's Alexandra Dulgheru to reach the third round of the US Open.

The fifth seed paid the price for an erratic display in the first set and needed two hours and 38 minutes to grind out a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 win over the world No 95.

Sharapova began well enough, breaking Dulgheru's first service game to lead 2-0.

Power: Sharapova recovered from a difficult start in her second-round match which lasted well over two hours

But the Romanian hit straight back and, as Sharapova's unforced errors mounted, Dulgheru made it five games out of six.

Sharapova forced her to serve out the set but could not get the break she was looking for as Dulgheru calmly guided a forehand down the line on set point.

The Romanian was once a top-30 player before knee problems in 2011 and 2012 stalled her rise.

She doggedly stuck with Sharapova in the early stages of the second set as the Russian's noise and power levels increased but eventually Dulgheru could withstand no longer.

The third set was nowhere near as one-sided as the scoreline suggests but Sharapova's phenomenal competitive spirit got her over the line.

The Russian will hope it is a good omen after she recovered from a set down in a succession of matches at the French Open before going on to take the title.

'We started under the sun and finished under the lights,' said Sharapova. 'It was tricky conditions, a tough opponent so I'm very happy I was able to come back and come through and win this match.'
