Snooker champion Stephen Hendry has won a five-year battle with his neighbours to build 11 luxury homes in his back garden

Snooker champion Stephen Hendry has won a five-year battle with his neighbours to build 11 luxury homes in the back garden of his mansion – just a stone's throw from Gleneagles.

The seven-times world champion, 46, is set to build a multi-million pound housing development on land currently used as a horse paddock and stables on his Perthshire country estate.

He and neighbour Alexander Birnie teamed up to apply for permission to build 11 new homes less than two miles from the world-famous course at Gleneagles.

But the move upset  residents in the upmarket village who voiced fears that  it will invade their privacy and spoil the natural beauty of the area.

The Auchterarder development was originally given the go-ahead in 2012 but construction never started because of the decline in the housing market.

Renewed plans were submitted to Perth and Kinross Council last month by Mr Birnie's company Craigmount Developments and they have now been given the green light. 

Drawings submitted in 2011 for a planned house on Mr Hendry's land show a large four-bedroom property.

The proposed house has a massive snooker room at the rear as well as a studio, a TV room, a drawing room and a built-in garage.

Mr Hendry left the family home last year after splitting from his wife Mandy, but he still owns the land.

The couple moved into the turreted five-bedroom mansion in 1996 after paying £300,000 and they carried out extensive renovations.

They rented the house out for rumoured five-figure sum during the golf tournament. 

Council planners approved the application after finding it complied with the local development plan and that there were no 'material considerations' to justify refusal.

In an objection letter sent to the council, neighbour Colin Campbell said: 'You have requested comments from property owners bordering this development. What is the point?

'Your department has already rubber-stamped every housing development plan for Auchterarder in recent years.

'Bett Homes, Cala, Robertson Homes, Muir Homes, Milne Homes etc together will build in excess of 1,000 new homes.

'When occupied this will double the population of Auchterarder with little or no consideration given by you to the impact of schooling, town parking, medical facilities or shopping facilities.

'This application is yet another example of a developer squeezing many properties onto a small plot.'

Another neighbour said: 'I am concerned about the loss of privacy this would cause and because it spoils the status quo.

'The area is absolutely beautiful in terms of the visibility I have right up to the Grampians and we thought we were very lucky to find this house.

'I'm not surprised our concerns have been ignored. I don't have much faith in the system.'

Mr Hendry left the family home last year after splitting from his wife Mandy, but he still owns the land (pictured together with their oldest son Blaine in 1999)

Last year, it was reported that the father-of-two, who has estimated £11 million fortune,  left his wife and moved to England with 26-year-old actress Lauren Thundow.

Mrs Hendry, 46, has launched divorce proceedings against him at Liverpool County Court.

Following their split Mandy said: 'I am heartbroken Stephen has made the decision to leave the marital home and relocate to England for a new relationship.'

Mr Hendry, widely regarded as the greatest ever snooker player, retired from competitive sport in 2012 and now works as a BBC pundit and as an ambassador for the sport.

He was not available for a comment when contacted.
