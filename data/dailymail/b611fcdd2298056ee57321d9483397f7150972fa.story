A Transformer-style ‘flying car’ being developed by an Arizona company could soon spell the end of runways.

The company’s vision is to build a vehicle with four rotors that allow it to take to the air anywhere like a helicopter - and then switch to fly like a normal plane.

While this ‘SkyCruiser’ vehicle is still some way from development, the technology could soon become a reality in a functioning prototype dubbed the ‘SkyProwler’.

The SkyProwler has four horizontal propellers that allow it to perform vertical take-offs and landings, and to hover in mid-air.

‘This opens up flying to a much larger range of possible terrains, from backyards and rough fields, to a boat on the sea,’ the company writes on its Kickstarter campaign.

Users can instruct the aircraft to retract its landing gear and pull its four rotor props into the sides of its body.

In this mode, the craft is powered by two rear props allowing it to cover bigger distances at 83 mph (134 km/h).

For slow-speed flight, they craft’s weight can be cut by temporarily removing its wings and tail. It will then travel at 35mph (56 km/h).

According to Krossblade, flight time ranges from 24 minutes when it is in quadcopter mode to 40 minutes when flying fixed-wing.

Nose cones on the drone can also be changed, allowing it to carry different gadgets such as a HD camera, according to a report in Gizmag.

In ‘hornet configuration’, without the tail and wings, the craft has a range of 14 miles (22km) and in ‘blade configuration’ it can travel for 43 miles (69km).

The SkyProwler is controlled using a radio remote control unit that comes with a live-streaming video screen.

Users also have the option of removing the GPS module from the drone, and carrying it with them so that it acts as a homing beacon.

The patent pending switchblade mechanism forms the basis of the transformation of SkyCruiser and SkyProwler. 

Airplanes need to fly fast and to fly fast you need to be as aerodynamically clean as possible.

That's why airplanes are long and narrow, somewhat drop-shaped and with as few 'things' sticking out as possible.

For vertical take-off and landing on the other hand, you need to be the opposite of aerodynamic. The more things you have sticking out producing lift (think of the extreme of a parachute for example) the easier it is to hover.

The craft can switch between plane and quadcopter mode with a special 'switchblade'

 This is one of the main reasons that helicopters which a great at hover, are not very good at forward flight, being slow as well as needing a lot of fuel.

The switchblade mechanism transforms an aircraft from the aerodynamically clean airplane configuration to the VTOL configuration, which features a number of rotors that together have a large rotor disc area that is ideal for hovering at low power. 

According to Krossblade, flight time ranges from 24 minutes when it is in quadcopter mode to 40 minutes when flying fixed-wing. Pictured are the craft's key features

A ready-to-fly package is currently being advertised on Kickstarter for $899. Shipping is estimated for July, if the Kickstarter is able to raise enough funds.

The SkyProwler is based on the larger concept of the SkyCruiser transforming vehicle, which was unveiled last year.

In normal flight, the SkyCruiser uses two 150 bhp electric motors in the tail, but when switching from horizontal to vertical flight, a set of four 'switchblade' rotor arms fold out from the fuselage to take the load.

There are four 80 bhp electric motors running the four main rotors, plus another four 10 bhp rotors to providing stability in crosswinds.

According to Krossblade, the smaller rotors can accelerate faster than the larger ones, so they can respond faster to sudden gusts.

On the ground, the 9.5 m (31 ft) wing span can be stowed away, and electric motors mounted in the wheels drive the craft along at 75 mph (112 kph) - although be warned, it is 8.4 m (27.5 ft) long.
