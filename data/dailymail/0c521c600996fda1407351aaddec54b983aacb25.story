It was one of the biggest trends of 2013 - the selfie.

But just a few days into the new year and a new craze has already taken over - the animal selfie.

Twitter has been inundated with posts of animals pulling their best poses for the camera next to the hashtag #animalselfies.

And it's not just cats and dogs getting in on the action, with monkeys, horses and even bearded dragons getting involved.

It comes after Oxford Dictionaries named the 'selfie' as the word of the year, beating tough competition from twerk, binge-watch and showrooming.

Another big craze of 2013 involved farmers taking their own ‘felfies’ of themselves alongside their herds.

But pet owners now seem to have been pushed out of the picture all together as their animals take centre stage in these animal selfies.
