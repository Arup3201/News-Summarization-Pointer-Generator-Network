A doctoral student has delivered a stranger's baby after seeing her in distress at a busy campus bus stop - and later learned the new mother had named the newborn girl after her.

Emily Brewer, 36, was catching a bus home with her two-year-old son, Dylan, from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on Wednesday when she noticed a woman gesturing to her.

The woman led her to another, heavily-pregnant woman who spoke Spanish and no English, but Ms Brewer soon learned that her waters had just broken - and that she was in obvious pain.

Ms Brewer asked the woman how pregnant she was and, as she eventually understood the woman was 38 weeks along, a baby girl dropped into her loosened trousers.

'It was what every mother-to-be dreads,' Ms Brewer told MailOnline. 'She was out running errands and her waters broke. But she stayed so calm, she was never in a lot of dire pain. It was very quiet.'

Ms Brewer placed her son on the bus stop's bench and called 911, and the dispatcher led her through the final processes, telling her how to use a shoelace to cut the umbilical cord.

The dispatcher also told her to clean the baby's nose and mouth and, without a sterile alternative, the team used the mother's scarf.

Despite the bizarre situation near the busy campus, with students milling past, Ms Brewer said she stayed calm.

Official meeting: Just hours after the new mother was whisked off by paramedics, Brewer tracked Lopez down in hospital and met the baby girl, named Emily, with her own child, Dylan

'Being a mum myself, I was able to 
put myself in her shoes and imagine how scared I would have been,' she 
said. 'If an undergraduate had seen her, I'm not sure they would have 
been able to help.'

She added that her son witnessed some
 of the birth but did not seem bothered by it. He even asked whether the
 baby had grown into the woman's trousers.

Moments after the delivery was 
complete, paramedics from Orange County EMS swooped on the scene and 
took the new mother and her daughter to hospital just a mile away.

But as the events sunk in, Ms Brewer, from Carrboro,  said she needed to know what had happened to the mother.

'It was all I could think about,' she told MailOnline. 'I just felt like our fates had crossed and we needed to meet again.'

So on Wednesday evening, Ms Brewer went to the hospital with Dylan and her husband, Patrick McDonough, to try to track down the woman and her newborn.

A nurse put the pieces together and asked the new mother, who they learned was called Aguilar Lopez, for permission for the family to visit.

'The nurse said her face lit up,' Ms Brewer said, adding of Lopez: 'She was calm and happy and beautiful, and the baby was at her side wrapped up.'

The mothers officially met, and Ms Brewer was introduced to the eight-hour-old baby girl, who was a health 5lb 9oz.

And when Lopez asked Brewer for her 
name, the new mother noted it down. Brewer later learned that the new 
baby had been named Emily, because Lopez thought she was 'an angel'.

'I am humbled,' Brewer said. 'Every single person who participated in my son's birth is in my memory and always will be. To know that I am part of this woman's birthing experience is just extraordinarily humbling.'

After handing in her dissertation for her doctorate - on 18th and 19th century English Literature - on Monday, celebrating the presidential election on Tuesday, and stepping in as a honorary midwife on Wednesday, Brewer said she wonders what else will happen this week.

But there's one thing she does know. 'I really feel like we will meet again,' she said of Lopez.
