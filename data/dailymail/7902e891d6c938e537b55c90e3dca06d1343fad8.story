A mail carrier in British Columbia, Canada, has been unable to deliver a package to a house – and it's all because of a bear on the prowl.

Matthew Fane, from a Vancouver suburb, tweeted Wednesday a photo of a note left for him by a Canada Post worker indicating that the reason he was unable to drop off a parcel was because there was a 'bear at door.'

A picture of the decent-sized black mammal has since surfaced to prove the claim, showing the grizzly scarily lurking out front of the house.

Fane was impressed with the postal carrier's justification, writing on Twitter: 'Ok, fair enough @canadapostcorp that's a decent reason to not drop the package off at my door.'

Fur real?! Matthew Fane, of British Columbia, appreciated a Canada Post employee's excuse for not delivering a parcel he has been expecting after encountering a bear outside his house

When the 
Canadian mail service responded asking Fane to provide his exact 
location so that they could investigate the incident, the homeowner 
insisted he had no complaints.

'The service was great, ' he tweeted, 'just thought it was funny.'

Speaking to Huffington Post Canada, Mr Fane said furry predators are not uncommon in his neck of the woods.

In

 that mail carrier left the note at his mailbox up the street from the 
house.

Grin and bear it: Mr Fane tweeted at Canada Post that he was perfectly satisfied with their service

Fane kept mum on the contents of the parcel, the delivery of which was thwarted by the arrival of the unexpected woodland visitor.

There is no word on what kind of bear it was, but British Columbia is home to massive populations of both black and grizzly bears.

The concise missive from the postal worker has become a viral hit on Twitter, having been shared more than 4,000 times in a single day, and counting.
