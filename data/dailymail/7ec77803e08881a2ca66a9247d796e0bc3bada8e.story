They are one of the first examples of drone art - and could be created by anyone with access to a flying craft.

These stunning images were created by Florida design firm Fiction - by simply taping some lights to their quadcopter.

Using a tripod and a camera set to capture a long exposure, the team simply then flew their drone around in front of nearby landmarks.

The images were created by flying a drone fitted with lights around in front of a long exposure picture.

Thre be dragons! Photoshop was also used to modify the light patterns, allowing the perfectly symetrical images to be built from the flight patterns

The team bought coloured lights from home Depot and strapped them to a  DJI Phantom quadcopter.

They then set up a camera with a long exposure on a tripod.

Once the shutter was released, the drone flew around, and its light trail was captured.

The team then used Photoshop to 'mirror' the trail, creating these images.

The images were all created in a single night.

The images were inspired by a sci-fi hit.

'I've always loved the aesthetic of the movie Close Encounters of the Third Kind,' Chase Heaveanor of Fiction told MailOnline.

'I love how they used lights to imply the shapes of the UFO as opposed to spelling it out for the viewer. 

'So I figured I would try to recreate a similar vibe with the DJI Phantom and see what would come of it.

'I attached some lights that I bought from Home Depot and shot some long exposure shots of the phantom flying around.

'I then brought them back into the computer and created some cool patterns in Photoshop.'

The team say the images took just a few hours to complete.

'We set up a camera with a tripod and spent a night photographing landmarks around our office winter Garden,' said Dylon York of Fiction.

'It was really low tech - we got a few lights from home depot, and taped them to the phantom.'

Hyperscape: The images have a space-like quality, looking rather like a sci-fi film special effect
