Airbus has patented innovative technology to scare off fowl that gather in flocks near airports in an attempt to avoid costly and potentially devastating bird strikes.

The proposed system would mimic bird noises and can be set up on the ground at an airport or its equipment can be fitted to front of an aircraft.

It’s the latest example of the lengths that manufacturers, airlines and airports are reaching as bird strikes cost the world’s aviation industry nearly £1bn a year as a result of damage, delays for travellers or missed flight connections.

Patent: Airbus has patented a system that mimics the sounds of birds in an attempt to prevent bird strikes

Nearly 2,500 bird strikes were reported in the UK last year with an average of around six a day, according to the Civil Aviation Authority.

A Federal Aviation Administration study suggests there are an average of nine bird strikes a day involving civil aircraft in the US alone.

To repel birds, Airbus’ system mimics warning signals from birds of prey, natural distress calls from specific flocks, and the flapping of wings.

The ‘acoustic scaring device’ would be located on a plane’s nose landing gear, according to a rough sketch submitted with the patent application.

Airbus patented the system as it expects a ‘considerable increase’ in the number of bird strikes due to a risk in air traffic in South America, Asia and Africa, and that potentially means more delays for passengers.

But the manufacturer admits it may not have found the perfect solution because some bird species may become accustomed to the noise or it may have no effect at all.

Last week, discount airline Fastjet announced that bird strikes had wreaked havoc on its operations.

With four incidents in two weeks, the Gatwick-based airline had to delay or cancel flights because it had no replacement aircraft available.

Miracle on the Hudson: There was no loss of life after a US Airways flight ditched into New York's Hudson River

Manufacturers, airlines and airports have been paying greater attention to the problem since arguably the most famous bird strike of all time. 

Known as the Miracle on the Hudson, a US Airways Airbus A320 was forced to ditch into the Hudson River in New York after hitting a flock of Canada geese on 29 January 2009. 

The incident was dubbed a ‘miracle’ because no one died.

The largest loss of life resulting from a bird strike occurred in 1960, when an Eastern Air Lines flight struck a flock of European starlings during take-off.

All four engines were damaged and the plane crashed in the Boston, Massachusetts, harbour, killing 62 people.

Since 1912, there have been nearly 250 fatalities arising from bird strikes, according to the European Aviation Safety Agency.

A study conducted by London consulting firm Insight SRI found that bird strikes occur 2.1 times per 10,000 aircraft movements, and roughly two-thirds cause no damage.

The remainder cost roughly £41,000 per strike, according to the study.
