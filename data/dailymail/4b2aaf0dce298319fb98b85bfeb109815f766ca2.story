A third of us are struggling to cope at work because of depression, stress or burn out - but are you one of them?

Do you feel hopeless, have trouble sleeping and get little pleasure from life?

Or are you are you suffering from anxiety, perhaps fearing something awful will happen - or worrying about a host of different things?

Now, two tests used by the Channel 4
 show Embarrassing Bodies aim to indicate whether you are suffering 
from depression and/or anxiety, based on a few multiple choice questions
 about how you feel.

The results of both tests will be discussed live tonight on Embarrassing Bodies at 8pm on Channel 4.

Developed by doctors and called the PHQ-9 depression screener, the first test asks how often in the past two weeks 
you have been concerned with a set of problems.

Be aware it is not a diagnosis tool – only a 
trained medical professional can diagnose you with depression. The aim is to provide a useful indication of your risk of suffering from
 depression.

The test, developed by doctors and called the PHQ-9 depression screener, asks how often in the past two weeks you have been concerned with a set of problems. The graphic above shows the results so far

To date, 165,000 people have taken the depression test, which grades people from low
 to extremely high risk. Nineteen per cent of the respondents came out as extremely high 
risk, with 17 per cent at very high risk.

Despite this, 63 per cent of those questioned said they would not feel comfortable telling relevant work colleagues about their condition, highlighting the stigma surrounding the condition.

Women were also at higher risk 
than men, with 39 per cent of them recording an extremely high or very high risk
 level, compared to 30 per cent of men.

When it comes to regions. Wales is the most depressed region of the UK with 40 per cent having an extreme or very high risk.

While people working in hospitality, food and drink were the most depressed, engineers were the least likely to be depressed.

Many people with depression also have symptoms of anxiety - and the results from this test also paint a worrying picture about the nation's mental health.

Called the GAD-7 screener, it asks you to say how much you have been concerned by 
certain behaviours over the past fortnight.

Of more than 200,000 people polled, a staggering 46 per cent of people came out as high or very high risk of having anxiety.  It was as high as 48 per cent among women and 38 per cent among men.

Again, those working in hospitality and the food and drink trade were the most anxious, as were the Welsh, with more than 50 per cent scoring as high or very high risk.

Those aged 18-30 were most likely to be suffering with the condition, the figures show.

And worryingly, only three per cent of those questioned said they would see their GP with anxiety. Instead, 81 per cent would either ignore the symptoms or try and deal with the problem on their own.

The results of both tests will be discussed live tonight on Embarrassing Bodies at 8pm on Channel 4.
