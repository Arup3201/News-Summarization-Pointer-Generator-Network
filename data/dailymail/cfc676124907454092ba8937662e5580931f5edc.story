A happy couple have tied the knot - despite the fact the husband is just two days younger than the bride’s father.

Annie and Gary Reed met three years ago when Annie was 18 and Gary was 49, while when Annie was a barmaid in Gary’s pub.

Despite their 31-year age gap the couple's relationship has gone from strength to strength. They have two children together - Teagan, two, and Kai, seven months and last month tied the knot in their hometown of Doncaster.

The happy couple tied the knot - despite the fact that Gary is just two days younger than Annie's dad

Speaking of how members of her family felt about the union Annie said: 'My dad walked me down the aisle - he’s two days older than Gary.

'I
 thought he would have issues with the two of us being together at first, but the
 first time he met Gary he shook his hand and they’ve been fine ever 
since.

Stay-at-home mum Annie, 21, said: 'We didn’t tell anyone about our relationship for the first three months though because we wanted to make sure it was the real thing, and we were worried what people would say.

'But friends and family were really supportive, especially when they could see how happy we were.'

When Annie and Gary first met when she started working in a pub where Gary was the landlord, they hit it off straight away

Annie adds: 'My ex was older than me too so no-one was really surprised that I’d gone 
for an older man, they just didn’t expect him to be that much older.

'Gary got jokes from people saying "you’ve done alright there" and stuff like that, but no-one said anything offensive to our faces.'

But Annie suspects not everyone was as open-minded about their relationship as they seemed. Although customers claimed to be happy for them, 
business at the pub declined and Gary was forced to sell up.

Annie said: 'A lot of people stopped coming in which was a real shame.

'We
 don’t know for sure if it was because of our relationship- because 
everyone was nice to our faces, but the timing matches up.'

Gary wore a kilt to the ceremony and the couple released white doves as a sign of their love

They kept their relationship a secret for the first three months, before telling family and friends

When Annie and Gary first met, when she started working in a pub where Gary was the landlord, they hit it off straight away, but Annie was already in a relationship with someone 20 years older.

She said: 'Things with him were always rocky and Gary was always there for me.

'One night my partner went too far and we broke up. I called Gary to tell him I’d have to leave the pub because I thought I was going to have to move back with my mum who lives in a different part of Doncaster.

'Instead, he invited me to stay for a while until I got myself sorted.'

Annie says she hadn’t thought about Gary in that way before but when she moved in the pair grew closer.

'Gary made me breakfast one morning and drove me to work and we kissed – it was clear then that we both felt the same way,' she said.

'After that, I just never left.'

The pair did keep their age-gap love quiet to begin with Annie said: 'I wanted to make sure it was something worth telling people about first.

The couple got engaged after they had been together six months and tied the knot this August in front of all their friends and family and could not be happier.

'I can talk to Gary about anything at all - that’s what attracted me to him.

'Of course, Gary and I do have some issues sometimes because he thinks he knows more because he’s done it before, but we don’t argue any more than a regular couple.'
