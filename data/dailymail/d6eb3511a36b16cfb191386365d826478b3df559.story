'Insensitive':Fox29 anchor Joyce Evans compared a deadly shooting to Breaking Bad on Twitter

A Philadelphia news anchor has been lambasted for tweeting a crude teaser comparing a fatal shooting to the grisly finale of Breaking Bad.

'Thought "Breaking Bad" was hot last Sunday?,' Fox29 news anchor Joyce Evans wrote on Twitter. 'See who's 
breakin' bad in SW Philly leavin' 6 people SHOT - Tonite at Ten!'

It referred to a story about a shooting in Philadelphia on Sunday night that left a 23-year-old man dead and five others injured.

Immediately after posting the tweet, other Twitter users branded her an 'attention w****' and criticized her for the poor choice of words.

'Is that for real?' one asked. 'We make jokes in light of a serious tragedy?'

'Tackiest local new tease ever,' one said, while another added: 'Can't wait for the on-air apology!'

Evans' name was soon trending in Philadelphia and eventually across the country, according to Trendsmap Philly.

But as criticisms flooded in, Evans refused to back down.

'Last tweet NOT AT ALL A JOKE,' she wrote. 'Very real life drama was the point as oppose to one that end on tv. That was my point.'

Another Twitter user responded: 'I don't think people missed your point as much as they didn't agree to how you presented it.'

Some users even took it a step further by creating '#JoyceEvansTweets', presenting fake tweets in the same tone.

'Fan of Home Alone? Check out this family that disappeared and left their two year old to die! #JoyceEvansTweets,' one, Mike Schaeff, wrote.

'Like The Newsroom? Find out who won't be in one for a while. #JoyceEvansTweets,' another, Mike Cabrey, added.

Her tweet was referring to a shooting outside Los Papi Deli in Southwest Philadelphia at 7pm on Sunday in which two gunmen fired as many as 50 shots on a group of men, aged 18 to 23.

Crime scene: Gunfire had erupted outside a deli in Southwest Philadelphia, killing one and injuring 5

One man died at the scene while five 
others were injured - suffering gunshot wounds to their extremities - 
and were rushed to hospital. One is in critical condition and the others
are stable.

Philadelphia Police Capt. George Fuchs told Fox29: 'We don't know who the intended target was, we don't have any witnesses, and we don't know what the motive was.

'As of now, we have a large crime scene, multiple, multiple rounds, shell casings on the ground. It looks like it was different caliber weapons. We also have projectiles and fragments all over the street – literally, all over the street.'

Joyce Evans, who is originally from Washington D.C., has worked at Fox29 since 1996 and anchors the News at Ten and co-anchors the News at Six every weekend.
