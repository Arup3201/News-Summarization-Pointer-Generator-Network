Two companies have been banned from selling kits to make ordinary cars look like Bentley models.

A judge has ruled that 'Bentley car kits' infringe copyright and patent designs.

Two business owners from Florida, United States, have been sued by Bentley Motors Limited, which said they were counterfeiting and diluting its trademark and cars.

The business owners from Florida, United States, have been sued by Bentley Motors Limited

And soon after the papers were filed, in the U.S. District Court in Tampa, Bentley applied for a preliminary injunction to block the making, advertising and selling of the kits, according to ABC News.

The companies sued were Fugazzi Cars in St. Petersburg, owned by Matthew McEntegart, and Keeping It Real Auto Customizing Inc, owned by Robert Frary III.

According to the website, Mr Frary's attorney, John McGuire, said his client only painted the cars that had kits already on them and that he had stopped doing this when he received the law suit.

He claimed to have only made around $1,500 in profit from doing this, but Bentley is said to be asking for tens of thousands of dollars in compensation.

This example of a Porsche 356 'Speedstar' body is not implicated in this case

Mr McEntegart, who claims to have filed for bankruptcy because of the claim, has denied infringing Bentley's copyright.

He said he is hoping to stay in the car kit business with his own body designs.
