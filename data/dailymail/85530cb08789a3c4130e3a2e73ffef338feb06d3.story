The winner of the Miss World pageant has addressed the historic Oxford Union debating chamber to tearfully clarify that beauty queens cannot save the planet.

Megan Young, who was crowned Miss World 2013, became tearful as she addressed some of the sharpest minds in student academics to defend pageants against critics of the industry who say they demean women.

She told the prestigious union, which has hosted Nelson Mandela, Albert Einstein, Mother Teresa,  and the Dalai Lama: 'People are saying you're Miss World you should save the world, and to be honest, we can't really save the world as a whole, we're doing it part by part. We're not Superman. We're human too.

Ms Young, who was crowned when she represented the country of her mother's birth, the Philippines, was helped at the debate by competitors for the Miss World 2014 title - including Miss England, Carina Tyrrell, who is a final year medicine student at Cambridge University.

Before the discussion, Tyrrell defended the competition from criticism that women are judged more on their looks rather than their brains.

'You are surrounded by women who represent their countries. These are role models, they are role models to young women and role models to society.'

Before she spoke to the crowd, Miss Young and this year's contestants were given a tour of the University's centuries-old buildings, where some of the world's most celebrated scientists, writers and academic minds have studied.

But Miss Young admitted she was feeling nervous about her speech in the chambers.

'I'm a bit nervous, of course we're in the Oxford University and we'll be with the Oxford Union, so for me to just step into this campus and be in this area where very famous people) have been, it's an honour and I'm just very excited and nervous at the same time.'

Once the tour was finished Miss Young and the Miss World contestants made their way to the Oxford Union, where they were also joined by the 1953 winner Denise Perrier.

Miss South Africa and Miss United States then delivered speeches before a busy Union.

After the speeches the Miss World contestants and students left the Union. But some were left feeling flat by the level of debate

'Miss World allows women the chance to represent their countries. It allows us the chance to lead. Miss World is not a celebrity, she is an ambassador. She tells women all around the world again that it's okay to have an opinion. She makes changes happen. She identifies problems and she finds solutions. She changes the world,' said Miss United States, Elizabeth Safrit.

The contestants then fielded questions from students and Miss Young became quite emotional as she recalled what the hardest part of being Miss World has been.

'And what... it hurts really, it really does hurt and sometimes you just can't help but cry. I'm sorry I'm getting really emotional because you know I've been through so many countries and it's just so difficult seeing them in this position and you know people are saying you're Miss World you should save the world, and to be honest, we can't really save the world as a whole, we're doing it part by part. We're not Superman. We're human too.'

After the debate the Miss World contestants and students left the Union.

But some were left feeling flat by the level of debate. 

Oxford University student, Kate Welsh, said: 'I was a bit disappointed that it didn't have more of a debate, wasn't formed throughout the evening, perhaps, on the kind of moral issues behind having what's still fundamentally a beauty pageant. 

'And having women from such privileged backgrounds being supposedly representative of their countries,' said'All of us here just came to prove that it's a lot more than just pretty faces behind us. Whether it's a story or here for a reason, for a personal reason.'
