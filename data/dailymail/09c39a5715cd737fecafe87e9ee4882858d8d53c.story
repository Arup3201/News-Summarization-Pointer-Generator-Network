David Davis MP: 'They think we are better off, they think we are toffs'

David Cameron and his Cabinet are seen as well-fed toffs living in a different world, David Davis warned last night.

In a devastating analysis, the former Tory leadership contender said the Prime Minister needed to ‘get a grip’ in order to convince voters he shared their fears and aspirations.

Mr Davis said appearing out of touch could damage the Prime Minister’s prospects, just as sleaze had undermined John Major’s premiership.

Although the intervention has angered Tory high command, senior officials admit Mr Cameron is aware of the dangers and will push working-class ministers into the political frontline over the coming weeks.

In an interview with the BBC, Mr Davis warned that Budget decisions to cut the top rate of tax while imposing a ‘granny tax’ and a ‘pasty tax’ have created a new class divide and left poor and middle income earners feeling like they have been ‘pushed off the escalator’.

He also warned that the decision to cut child benefit had convinced voters that Old Etonian Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne ‘don’t know how we feel and work, what our lives are like’.

Man of the people? Osbourne may munch a pastry - but can David Cameron keep a grip on his party's image?

Mr Davis, who grew up in a council flat,
said: ‘It’s an unfair allegation, but it’s a powerful one, and it works
against us. They think we’re toffs.

‘The truth is, they look at the front bench, they see them all very well
dressed, well turned out, well fed, and perhaps feel that they’re in a 
different world to them.

Sleaze undermined John Major - could 'being a toff' undo Cameron?

The “we’re all in this together” phrase is very
important – but at the moment it’s not working.

‘Governments always have to watch this, that they don’t get stuck with 
an impression that plays against them. In John Major’s day it was 
sleaze.

Today this may be its equivalent. If it sticks it makes almost 
everything you do impossible to make work.’

A senior government source indicated that Tories with more humble 
backgrounds would now put the case to voters that the Tories are on 
their side.

Foreign Secretary William Hague is expected to be asked to undertake 
more media appearances, along with Communities Secretary Eric Pickles 
and party chairman Baroness Warsi.

‘Take a step back and look at people like William Hague, Eric Pickles, 
Patrick McLoughlin (chief whip) and Sayeeda Warsi,’ the source said.

‘People don’t care about the Prime Minister’s background. What they care about is that he is competent and he has got a grip.’

But Tory MP Mark Pritchard, secretary of the backbench 1922 Committee, 
warned the best option was a ministerial reshuffle to get ‘greater 
representation of people from all sorts of backgrounds’ on the front 
bench.’

He said: ‘Those people that perhaps have struggled at some point in 
their life to pay the electric bill or have perhaps arrived in school in
a Morris Minor rather than a Jaguar are more likely to have empathy 
with those people who are currently struggling.’

Doubts were also expressed about George Osborne’s chancellorship and his
prospects of succeeding Mr Cameron. ‘George is no longer fit to be 
prime minister,’ one junior minister told the Mail.

Mr Cameron faced fresh embarrassment over the ‘pasty tax’ last night after his main justification for the raid collapsed.

He has claimed it was simply ironing out a loophole that has existed since Nigel Lawson imposed VAT on hot fast food in 1984.

But Labour last night released a letter written by Lord Lawson from that year showing he had never intended pasties to be hit.

The letter said: ‘It does not apply to food and drink which has cooled 
to room temperature by the time it is sold, or to things like pies and 
pastries which are sold warm because they happen to be freshly baked.
