Michelle Obama has added to her portfolio of TV appearances by joining the team on ABC's popular show Extreme 
Makeover: Home Edition. 

The First Lady is reportedly great fan of the programme that creates homes for families in need. 

Mrs Obama told People.com: 'This 
particular show is especially moving because it features Barbara 
Marshall, a Navy veteran, who despite her own struggles opened her home 
to serve homeless female veterans in her community.
