Double Olympic champion Mo Farah is to have his gold medals engraved in honour of his twin daughters, who were born just days after his remarkable Games success.

The athlete was one of the stars of London 2012, winning the 10,000m event before going on to triumph in the 5,000m, cheered on by his heavily pregnant wife Tania.

A fortnight after clinching that second gold, Tania gave birth to daughters Aisha and Amani, who will now each receive one of their father's medals.

Farah, 29, said that Aisha would receive his medal for the 10,000m because she was born first. Amani will get the 5,000m medal.

The medals will have their names engraved on them, the Somali-born athlete said.

Appearing on ITV's Daybreak, Farah said he had had the 'perfect' Olympics.

He added: 'I could never have imagined it would be like that. As an athlete you dream of becoming an Olympic champion, but not in front of a home crowd, and also twice doing it.'

The girls were born on August 25, with Aisha weighing in at 5lb 2oz, and Amani, 4lb 4oz.

Their presence was felt weeks 
earlier, however, when millions watched Farah throw his arms around his 
heavily pregnant wife on the track moments after winning the 10,000m.

Farah has a step-daughter, Rihanna, who is seven, and was seen with Tania celebrating on the track with him after the race.

Farah
 said preparations for the Olympics had been 'tough' for his family, who
 moved with him to the US so he could take advantage of better training 
facilities.

Pictures of Farah with his daughters first appeared in Hello! magazine

'It
 hasn't been easy moving everyone there, but it was all worth it because
 else I wouldn't be able to come out here and become double Olympic 
champion,' he added.

Farah will be among hundreds of British athletes taking part in a parade through the streets of London today.

He said he was 'very excited' about the event.

He added: 'It should be good. There's a lot of people out there, you know Chris Hoy and the rest of the guys, Bradley Wiggins.

'I'm looking forward to it, mixing with everyone and having a good laugh. It's time for us to enjoy it one last time, I guess.'

Farah also spoke about getting children involved in sport from a young age.

He said: 'It's very important that we introduce children to sport. Sport's helped me.

'I've travelled around the world. If I didn't get into sport at an early age then I wouldn't be here today.'
