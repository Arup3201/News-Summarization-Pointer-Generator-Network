A 77-acre plot of land deemed the most expensive field in Britain has been put on the market – for a staggering £30million.

The patch of land, nestled in the heart of the countryside, is set to become the foundations of a 33,000 sq. ft ten-bedroom mansion which will come complete with an indoor swimming pool and spa.

It is thought the estate, situated near 
Windsor Great Park, will be worth £100million once completed – making it
 the most expensive private home outside of London and potentially netting the owner a £50million profit.

The proposed £15million property, which 
would be 30 times the size of an average new home, is set to come 
complete with an indoor swimming pool, spa, cinema, library and 
accommodation for staff.

Its neighbours include Elton John and The Queen and it is rumoured the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had previously expressed interest in the estate.

The plot of land, which includes a picturesque lake, woodland and formal gardens, was bought by Candy & Candy in 2007, who obtained planning permission for a mansion. It was then sold to its current, private owner.

However, they have now decided to put the site on the market with joint agents Beauchamp Estates and Grosvenor Billingshurst. 

Parts of the site, which is only 23 miles from London, have fallen into disrepair over the years and there are currently several derelict buildings across the estate.

However, planning permission has already been sought and granted by Runnymede Council to demolish the main Parkwood building, three estate cottages, a pool building and ancillary estate buildings.

The 77-acre plot of land, pictured, has been put up for sale for a whopping £30million and has already had planning permission accepted for a £15million mansion - an artist's impression of which is pictured centre left

The authority has also accepted plans to build the £15million mansion, which will become the main dwelling on the estate, as well as two independently-owned gate houses and an access bridge.

Gary Hersham, boss of Beauchamp Estates, said: ‘This is a unique opportunity to acquire a prime Surrey country estate and create a bespoke stately home of outstanding luxury and quality.

‘The completed residence could be worth up to £100million, effectively trebling the value of the estate.

‘For a discerning buyer this is an outstanding lifestyle and investment opportunity with the potential for huge capital value uplift.’

Whoever buys the land will have to knock down the current derelict house on the estate before building the proposed mansion in its place.

Ian Davies, Director, Grosvenor Billinghurst, said: ‘This is an utterly extraordinary proposition combining such acreage and an exceptional planning permission.

‘These factors combine to make this one of the most exciting real estate opportunities in the Home Counties in the last ten years.

‘The Parkwood Estate has the potential to become Surrey's most outstanding, luxurious and valuable country house estate.’

Parkwood Estate first came into 
prominence at the height of the Victorian era when a late 19th Century 
mansion was built on the land.

For
 most of its life, the estate was owned by Australian entrepreneur Clive
 Baillieu, also known as the First Baron Ballieu of Sefton.

Baillieu,
 who worked for Dunlop Tyres, would host grand parties for famous 
British car firms such as Rolls Royce, Bentley and Jaguar. The cars 
would be raced at high speed along the drives of the estate.

The estate then became the Rank Hovis Conference and Training Centre.

After
 Rank Hovis left, the building became derelict and over the course of 
many years fell into a state of complete disrepair, resulting in 
Runnymede Council providing planning permission for it to be demolished.
