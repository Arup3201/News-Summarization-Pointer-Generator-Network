A quarter of people living in Britain’s biggest cities are immigrants, an official analysis showed yesterday.

A study of census figures revealed that nearly one in three big-city residents is a member of a non-white ethnic minority, and that nearly one in ten homes has no-one who speaks English as their main language.

The figures were put together by the Office for National Statistics from the results of the 2011 national census in the four biggest built-up areas: surrounding London, Manchester, the West Midlands and West Yorkshire.

In these conurbations, more than 25 per cent of the population were born abroad. Being born outside Britain is accepted by the statisticians as the best measure of who is  an immigrant.

The figures mark a major change since 2001, and reflect  the high levels of immigration from both Eastern Europe and outside Europe that were encouraged during Labour’s years in power.

The census returns of 2001 showed much lower ethnic minority populations than in the ONS analysis of 2011, although the latter uses different boundaries.

The 2001 census said that in London 75.9 per cent of the population was born in the UK, in Greater Manchester 92.1 per cent, in the West Midlands 88.8 per cent, and in West Yorkshire 91.2 per cent.

In 2011, in the same local government areas, the UK-born population of London was down to 63.3 per cent; Greater Manchester 87.9; the West Midlands 83.4; and West Yorkshire 88.5 per cent.

The latest figures also suggest that nine per cent of homes in the big cities have no-one who speaks English as their main language. The ONS said that this compares with one per cent of homes in  villages and small towns.

The broad picture of the make-up of the cities is taken from an analysis of built-up areas carried out for the first time in 2011. The figures apply to areas which are considered to be ‘irreversibly urban in character’.

Immigration: Census figures showed 13.3 per cent of the English population as a whole were born abroad

The four major conurbations each have well over a million inhabitants. Behind them come seven ‘large built-up areas’, each with between half a million and a million people.

The countryside is disappearing around the biggest cities, officials admitted yesterday.

Greater London now stretches from St Albans in the north to Harlow in the east and Guildford in the south west, according to the ONS analysis.

In the north, Leeds and Bradford have effectively joined up to form a single conurbation.

Planning rules and green belt laws have failed to curb urban sprawl in some areas, the ONS said.

These are Bristol, Leicester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Sheffield, Tyneside and the area surrounding Southampton and Portsmouth.

Second-tier cities have been much less affected by immigration than the big conurbations, the report said.

The four major cities had more than double the proportion of people born abroad than the seven large built-up areas – 25.3 per cent against 11.4 per cent.

Census figures published last year showed that 13.3 per cent of the English population as a whole were born abroad.

Earlier this week, it emerged that more than a million schoolchildren have English as their second language.

Department for Education figures show the number of pupils aged five and upwards speaking other first languages in primary, secondary, special and pupil referral units has risen by almost 54,000 to 1,061,100.
