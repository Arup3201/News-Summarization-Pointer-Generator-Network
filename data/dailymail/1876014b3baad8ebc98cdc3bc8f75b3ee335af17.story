Jayden Nash, 6, died of severe brain injuries 10 days after he raced out onto the road and was hit by a car

A six-year-old boy hit by a car and killed on his way to school may have run out onto the road because he was upset he had been denied sweets, an inquest has heard.

Jayden Nash died of severe brain injuries 10 days after he raced out into the road moments after stepping off a bus.

His mother Jordan Johnson said Jayden was normally very careful when crossing the road but may have run ahead that day because he was in a strop after she refused to buy him sweets.

Dawn Jolleys was driving past with her husband and children when she saw something out of the corner of her eye but, despite braking instantly, could not prevent the car hitting Jayden and throwing him nearly 30 metres down the road.

His mother, Jordan Johnson, did not see the crash but heard a bang and then ran screaming into the road when she realised what had happened.

Jayden was airlifted to Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital where doctors spent 10 days battling to save his life, but their efforts were in vain and he died on February 15 from a severe traumatic brain injury.

Delivering a verdict of accidental death yesterday, Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter described it as a 'tragic' incident.

Mr Salter said: 'It’s many parents’ biggest nightmare, this type of situation.

'All that parents can do is educate and remind children about the dangers of crossing the road, but of course children are impulsive by nature.'

Jayden left his home in Marlborough Close, Faringdon, Oxfordshire, at around 7.45am on February 5 with his mother and two siblings and were joined by a neighbour’s child.

After dropping one of the children at nursery, the group went to catch a bus to Watchfield, Oxfordshire.

Arriving in Faringdon Road, Watchfield, at about 8.20am, Jayden and the neighbour’s child got off the bus ahead of his mother, who was struggling with a pushchair.

The two children walked to the back of the bus just as Mrs Jolleys was driving down the road in her white Audi Q5 with her husband and their two young children.

In evidence, she told the inquest in Oxford, Oxfordshire, that she was driving under the 40mph speed limit past the bus when she saw movement out of the corner of her eye.

Although she hadn’t yet seen Jayden, she automatically started braking.

Mrs Jolleys said: 'As I was braking I then clearly saw a young boy run across the road from behind the rear of the bus. I remember shouting ‘stop’ but he kept running out. He did not seem to look at me, as if he did not see my car. Everything seemed to be happening in slow motion, there was nothing I could do.'

Jayden was hit by the front of the car, thrown nearly 30 metres down the road as the Audi screeched to a halt.

On the pavement, Ms Johnson was just a few metres away from Jayden.

She said in evidence: 'As I got to the back end of the bus I heard a bang and saw something flying across the road. It looked like something you would see on TV. I left my daughter in the pushchair and ran across the road. I then realised it was Jayden on the ground and he had been hit by a car.'

Mrs Jolleys’ husband Guy rushed to Jayden’s side while she remained in the car 'shocked and traumatised'.

Medical teams spent days trying to save him but by February 14 it was clear his injuries were not survivable and he was pronounced dead at 4.24am the next day.

An investigation into the crash placed no fault on Mrs Jolleys, who was travelling at around 36mph and had less than a second to react to the incident.

Police constable James Henderson told the inquest: 'There does not appear to be anything that the driver of the Audi could have done to avoid the collision.'
