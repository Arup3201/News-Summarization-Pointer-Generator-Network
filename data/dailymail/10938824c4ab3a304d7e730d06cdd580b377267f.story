It just goes to show that demonstrators don’t have to live in a big city to show their support for the Occupy Wall Street protests.

Diane McEachern ventured out onto the foggy western Alaska tundra a week ago but had no idea her tiny demonstration would go viral.

The University of Alaska assistant professor took a photo in Bethel with her three dogs, holding a hand-printed sign reading: ‘Occupy the Tundra’.

'Occupy the Tundra': Diane McEachern ventured out onto the foggy western Alaska tundra a week ago but had no idea her protest would go viral

She was kneeling on the frost-covered ground and dressed in proper Alaska gear for the season with a borrowed musk-ox wool scarf to keep warm.

Ms McEachern wants to support the movement against a financial system protesters say most benefits corporations and the wealthy.

But she also wanted to show a sense of humour. ‘Part of it was whimsical, yes, but it was also authentic,’ she said.

But after she posted her self-portrait on Facebook, the response was overwhelming and she was inundated with interview requests by the media.

‘Waking up to 200 friend requests,’ she said. ‘On a good day, five would make sense. I never thought it would get all the attention it has.’

The caption said: A’ lonely vigil in remote Alaska. I'm wearing a muskox neck warmer (that is not a beard on my face) and I am a woman.  The dogs are rescues.

‘The tundra is outside of Bethel, Alaska. The day is chill. The sentiment is solid. Find your spot. Occupy it. Even if it is only your own mind. Keep this going...’

She has now had more than 8,500 people 'like' the photo on Facebook, while it has received more than 4,000 shares and more than 1,000 comments.

The three dogs pictured are called Mr Snickers, Seabiscuit and Ruffian. The tundra display was not her first such political demonstration.

She said she stood alone in Bethel in 2003 in minus 40F weather to protest the U.S. invasion of Iraq, with a sign saying: ‘It's never too cold to oppose war.’

Now others in rural Alaska outposts are following her example.
