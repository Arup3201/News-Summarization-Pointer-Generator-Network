An 11-year-old girl with an impeccable sales pitch has been been running her own successful company for six years.

Michigan native Asia Newson, the co-founder and CEO of a candle company called Super Business Girl, has become so successful during that time that she is now known as 'Detroit's youngest entrepreneur'. 

Asia makes the candles at home, with help from her parents, and sells them on the street, using the proceeds from her sales to pay for her own school supplies as well as clothing and food that she donates to needy children.

Asia demonstrated her confident pitch on ABC News' 20/20 last week; a camera followed her as she approached strangers and tried to convince them to invest in her growing business. 

'Today, I'm seeking a $20 investment so I can purchase the necessary tools I need to expand and grow my business,' she tells them.

In fact, one woman was so charmed by Asia's enthusiasm that she offered her a $100 bill.

With her father Michael waiting nearby, she also distributes business cards as she makes the rounds.

'Detroit is still a great place to start a business. We have wonderful people. They'll encourage you. I mean, I sell my candles here, like I make pretty good money,' the precocious pre-teen said.

Asia even caught the attention of Dave Anderson, co-owner of Bamboo Detroit, a local incubator for startups.

'She really understands business concepts a lot better than most adults that I interact with, and it's just a natural thing,' said Mr Anderson, who bought a candle from Asia last year.

'I was so impressed with her pitch, I just wanted to give her all the money in my pocket,' he added.

Bamboo Detroit has given Asia free space and Internet support to develop Super Business Girl and fulfill her dream of training other children in entrepreneurship.

On her website, Asia says her company's mission is to 'recognize the true potential in every child and to develop intrinsic security that makes optimum use of their individualized talent'.

Asia, who also sells her candles online for $9.99-$14.99, shared the story of how her business endeavor began during an interview with MSNBC in February.

'My dad was a salesman. He used to go out selling these candles and I used to tag along because there was no one to watch me.

'He used to say this complicated presentation, but somehow I just caught on. So one day I just interrupted his presentation and I said it, and as a matter of fact, I was making more money than him.'
