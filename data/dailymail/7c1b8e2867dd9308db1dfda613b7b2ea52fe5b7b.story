It’s a game that almost every single Australian has innocently played– but it’s an activity that kills within seconds.

Shallow Water Blackout is the number one killer of the most competent, fit swimmers – and it affects anyone holding their breath underwater, resulting in death  without warning.

It takes place when the swimmer loses consciousness due to a severe lack of oxygen to the brain.

It only takes two minutes for death to occur – whereas regular drowning takes six to eight minutes.

There is a dangerous lack of education and understand about the dangers of breath-holding – a silent killer which is a commonplace activity amongst Aussie children, elite swimmers and snorkellers, a 60 minutes report investigates.

In January last year, Jack MacMillan was just 12 years old - a water-loving, fit and competitive swimmer, when he died in his backyard pool in less than one metre of water.

In January last year, Jack MacMillan was just 12 years old - a water-loving, fit and competitive swimmer, when he died in his backyard pool in less than one metre of water

This is the pool where Jack died, in less than a metre of water in the pool's shallow end with his mother less than ten metres away

He had swum almost every day of the summer holidays and was excited to start high school in two day’s time.

‘He just loved being in the pool,' his mother Michelle MacMillan told 60 minutes.

‘He’d just go lap after lap after lap. Holding his breath, challenging himself to see how far, how many laps he can do.

‘Being a typical 12-year-old,’ recalled Jack’s mother Michelle MacMillan to 60 Minutes.

She had been watching just metres away as he swam, holding his breath as he swam to try and beat his personal best.

Jack's mother Michelle recalls how she ran to pull her son of the water and started CPR to try and revive Jack 

Ms MacMillan's swift response was not enough to save her son from the effects of Shallow Water Blackout

Without any warning, he floated to the bottom of the pool and never regained consciousness, despite his mother Michelle and emergency crew’s hour-long efforts to resuscitate him.

His mother had looked away for one to two minutes at most, and ran straight away to her son to drag him out of the pool and commence CPR.

‘I would have looked away momentarily, distracted by my baby in my arms,' said Ms MacMillan.

'I looked back and I saw him. He was at the shallow end of the pool, in metre-deep water,

'He was just curled in the foetal position at the bottom of the pool.’

Ms MacMillan's swift response was not enough to save her son from the effects of Shallow Water Blackout. 

 ‘I still don’t accept it, I still don’t understand it and I’ll never get over it,’ George MacMillan said of his son's tragic death

‘I did everything I could to try and save him and that’s the hardest thing - in the end I just couldn’t,' said Ms MacMillan.

A person on the brink of suffering a Shallow Water Blackout is totally unaware that they need to take a breath. 

‘He was at the shallow end of the pool – he could have just stood up but he didn’t get the warning,’ said Jack’s father, George.

Jack's parents had never heard of Shallow Water Blackouts and are now desperate to inform Australians about the deadly risks

Shallow Water Blackouts is a little-known condition and often deaths from SWB are incorrectly recorded as ‘drowning’ on coroner’s reports – as was Jack’s initially.

Jack's parents had never heard of Shallow Water Blackouts and are now desperate to inform Australians about the deadly risks.  

‘People have known about it since the 1950s, only written about it since 1986 and people have only been listening since 2000. It’s a long haul. Dr Tom Griffith.

‘It commonly affects the very competitive, type A personalities –the person who pushes themselves to the limit.

‘So they see how long they can hold their breath for, which is a recipe for disaster, particularly if they do it over and over and over again.’

Hypoxic drills involve underwater breath-holding and train the body to survive without taking a breath for extensive periods of time

Jack fit that description, according to his father, who describes his son as ‘a quiet achiever, he was determined to do his best at anything’

Hypoxic drills involve underwater breath-holding and train the body to survive without taking a breath for extensive periods of time.

These drills, used by coaches to train elite swimmers and military trainers, can be deadly.

A shallow blackout almost claimed the life of Emily Miles last month in suburban Perth, when she instantaneously lost consciousness during a hypoxic training session.

‘She sank in the blink of an eye,’ explained her father, Tony.

‘That image, the little body lifeless next to me. That was pretty traumatic. We got lucky.’

These drills, used by coaches to train elite swimmers and military trainers, can be deadly but remain a 'daily' part of swim training

The 12-year-old blacked out and was pulled unconscious from the pool.

She describes feeling ‘out of breath’ and then waking when the oxygen mask was placed on her face.

‘We have no scientific evidence to say that breath holding enhances performance. We don’t know of the benefits so why are we doing it?’ Dr Griffith.

Swimming Australia is reportedly aware of the risks but hypoxic drills are still a daily part of swim training, according to 60 minutes. 

‘I don’t think Swimming Australia is encouraging any coach to do hypoxic training,’ Swimming Australia head coach Jacco Verhaeren

‘These are guidelines to prevent and educate swimmers as much as possible from doing the wrong thing.’

The MacMillan family want people to know about the risks so nobody ever has to experience the loss that they have to live with everyday

'Shallow Water Blackout Australia' has now been established to try and make a change – to raise awareness and education to save the lives of other children, who would otherwise be unaware of the dangers of Shallow Water Blackhout.

The government commits more than $8 million a year to water safety but little is known about the dangers of Shallow Water Blackouts.

The MacMillan family want people to know about the risks so nobody ever has to experience the loss that they have to live with everyday.

‘I still don’t accept it, I still don’t understand it and I’ll never get over it,’ George MacMillan said of his son's tragic death.
