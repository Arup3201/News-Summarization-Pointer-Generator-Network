The U.S. government made three-quarters of requests to Twitter to reveal users' identities over the past six months, the microblogging site revealed in its latest transparency report.

The San Francisco-based company is under greater pressure from governments to release its users' personal details, with requests rising 40 per cent compared to the previous six months.

But with U.S. companies banned from revealing information requests made by the U.S. under the Patriot Act, the true total is likely to be much, much higher.

Welcome to Twitter... The U.S. government made three-quarters of requests to Twitter to reveal users' identities over the past six months, the microblogging site revealed in its latest transparency report

Today the Guardian revealed details of another top secret U.S. National Security Agency programme which allows its spies to search through the online activities of millions of people with no prior authorisation.

Twitter is not named in the report, which is based on leaked documents, but it is claimed the XKeyscore programme allows NSA staff to scour the emails, online chats and browsing histories of those targeted.

Governments usually want the email or IP addresses tied to a Twitter account.

The breakdown of the kinds of legal action used to compel Twitter to release users' personal information to the U.S. in the past six months

In one well-known case, a French court ordered Twitter in February to turn over information about an anonymous account that posted anti-Semitic tweets.

Twitter, which had initially resisted by arguing that the data was stored beyond French jurisdiction in its California servers, ultimately complied in June.

Explaining the numbers, the transparency report says: 'The United States leads the way, comprising 78 per cent of all requests received.

'Japan remains the second largest requester with a total of 8 per cent of overall requests, up from 6 per cent in July - December 2012.

'Brazil dropped from third overall in the last report to the number four spot with the United Kingdom moving up to number three, comprising 3 per cent of total requests received during the first half of 2013.'

Efforts to censor Twitter content have also risen sharply, the company said.

'Over the last six months, we have gone from withholding content in two countries to withholding content (ranging from hate speech to defamation) in seven countries,' said Jeremy Kessel, Twitter's legal policy manager.

Twitter was censored the most in Brazil, where courts issued orders on nine occasions to remove a total of 39 defamatory tweets.

Increasing pressure: How the 
number of information requests has increased over the 
three transparency reports published since January 2012 - not including requests made under the U.S. Patriot Act, which the firm is 
banned from revealing. Governments usually want the email or IP address linked to a particular account

Transparency reports such as the one published semi-annually by Twitter have been a particularly contentious issue in Silicon Valley in the wake of a series of leaks by former security contractor Edward Snowden.

He alleged that major service providers including Google, Facebook and Microsoft systematically pass along huge troves of user data to the U.S. National Security Agency.

The companies all deny the scope of Mr Snowden's allegations.

They have asked the U.S. government for permission to reveal the precise number of national security requests they receive in order to publicly argue that their cooperation with the government has been relatively limited.

In the first half of the year, authorities in Japan, another large Twitter user base, made 87 requests while U.K. agencies filed 26.

The majority of the requests come in the form of court-issued subpoenas, Twitter said.

The total could be much higher since the Silicon Valley firm is banned from revealing requests made under the Patriot Act
