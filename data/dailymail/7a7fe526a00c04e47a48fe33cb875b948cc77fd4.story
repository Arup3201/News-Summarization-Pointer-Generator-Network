Christian Connor secretly filmed female patients at two hospitals in Salford and tried to groom a 13-year-old online, being 'compelled' by his addictive personality and a foot fetish, a court heard 

A mental health worker was branded 'merciless' and 'odious' by a judge after he admitted secretly filming female patients in hospital toilets and grooming a 13-year-old boy online.

Christian Connor, 27,  was 'compelled' by an addictive foot fetish to spy on victims at two hospitals in Manchester as well as to take secret pictures of women using the bathroom in a Salford house, a court heard.

The mental health support worker was also found to have a cache of under-age and extreme pornography stored on his computer and attempted to persuade a teenage boy to send him pictures of his genitals.

Judge Douglas Moore sentenced Connor to 16 months in prison and said: 'You behaved in an appalling way showing a complete abuse of trust, targeting young people and individuals that you knew.' 

He added: 'Words like 'manipulative', 'despicable', 'merciless' and 'odious' spring to mind.'

Isleworth Crown Court heard Connor's crimes were uncovered when he was caught after befriending a 13-year-old boy from Hounslow, west London on the internet and persuading him to send images of his feet to an email address. The boy refused requests to send pictures of his genitals.

Officers traced Connor and seized his computer, which contained the secret footage he had filmed in Prestwich Hospital and Salford Royal Hospital. It also contained videos he had recorded in the bathroom of a house  as well as child and extreme pornography.

The offences took place between September 1, 2010 and April 16 last year. 

Judge Moore told him: 'You were within the mental health unit where people are seeking help and need security and you showed a ruthless disregard for their well-being.'

'You took photos of individuals when they were taking baths and showers and these people people thought you were a friend. 

'You showed no mercy to those individuals.'

Police seized 411 images mostly made up of Connor's secret filming, plus 12 more from the internet. These were category A, the most serious images.  

Connor, of Stretford, Manchester pleaded guilty to eight counts of voyeurism for the purpose of sexual gratification; three counts of possessing under-age and extreme pornography and one count of encouraging the making and distributing of indecent images.

He was also made subject of a ten-year Sexual Offences Prevention Order. 

The court heard Connor was 'aroused' by his ability to manipulate people and said the images were for his enjoyment.

Judge Moore added: 'This is an abuse of trust case because he worked within a mental health unit and he was a mental health support worker at the time.

'A mental health unit demonstrates clear vulnerability and one victim is reluctant to return because she no longer feels safe there.'

Connor admitted secretly filming patients at Prestwich Hospital, which provides mental health care 

Connor had worked at Salford Royal Hospital as a mental health support worker when he was arrested 

Connor was employed as an NHS support worker for six years, but was forced to abandon his degree studies two years in when arrested. His mother is an auxiliary nurse and his father, who supported him in court, a management accountant.

Penelope Blake, defending Connor said: 'He was living in this secret world where he was compelled by this addictive personality, this foot fetish, to commit the offences he did.

'It was a manifestation of his addiction, his obsession. This is not something he will be doing again and he is nothing but embarrassed, ashamed and disgusted.

'From an early age he wanted to spy on everyone and this grew into addictive, obsessive behaviour. He says he gets a 'buzz' from it and being in a position of power.

'There is almost an alter-ego person different to his day-to-day self,' added Miss Blake, who confirmed Connor has sought counselling since his arrest.

'He has lost his sister, who says she wants nothing more to do with him, his girlfriend, his friends and the stigma of these offences will follow him for the rest of his life. He'll be on the sex offenders register.'
