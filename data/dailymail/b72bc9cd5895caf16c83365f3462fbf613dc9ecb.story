The 25-year-old has modeled for fashion labels such as Lipsy and jewellery treasure trove Claire's Accessories and is a regular on the front rows of London Fashion Week.

But now - finally! - the stylish Chelsea socialite and business woman has released her very own clothing line.

Today sees the launch of Millie's first ever fashion collection - Millie Mackintosh.

Following eight months of design and development the capsule collection consists of 40 unique pieces including dresses, tops, jumpsuits and jackets.

Millie who certainly has a keen eye on the industry, and has had a hands-on approach from the label's beginnings says it has been a hectic couple of months to get the collection ready.

Millie has taken inspiration from her own wardrobe for the collection. Left Millie wears 

Millie has included a few investment pieces to be worn season after season  such as this jacket £250

'I have been working on it for eight months.' Says Millie, 'Usually designers take years before they launch a collection but we wanted to create a capsule line.

'We originally only wanted to do 20 pieces but we have ended up with 40 so it has been a bit of a whirlwind.'

Millie's collection doesn't look dissimilar to her typical outfit choices and that's because it isn't. When it came to design inspiration Millie says she looked no further than yours truly.

'I wanted the collection to represent me and I created it for myself really. It features a lot of embellishment which I love and we have some faux leather look pants and shorts.

'I really love the whole 60s and 70s look and that is reflected in the collection. It has quite a boho and vintage style, I wanted it to be quite young and fun.'

Model behaviour: Millie models the entire collection herself

The capsule collection is made up of 40 pieces and took Millie 8 months to design and develop

Millie hopes that her clothing line will attract the likes of Cheryl Cole and Abby Clancy. High-slit maxi skirt £59

For Millie versatility was hugely important in her range. She wanted pieces that would stand the test of time so that her customers weren't forking out for a new wardrobe each season.

'I wanted the collection to be quite timeless so that women could get a lot of wear out of them. There is that investment feel with a few pricier pieces.

'We have some really lovely blouses in black and cream that you can dress up in different ways. I wanted it so that you could take it from the office to the dance floor.'

For the fashion fanatic her collection has been a long time coming having always dreamt of owing her own boutique and creating her own clothes with a sewing machine as a child.

'This has always been my dream since I was little, to have my own shop. But we have been really lucky in getting it out there on the high street.'

Mrs Professor Green is thrilled to finally be able to show off her designs after months of planning and says that the initial reaction has been really positive.

Millie says that having her own clothing line has been a lifelong dream. Here she wears the double breasted lurex waistcoat £140

'It is so exciting but it is also so surreal to finally have it out after just working towards it. Up until now I have only been allowed to tease people but I have had a great response from my friends which I always think is the most important. 

'I was really worried about showing them because if your friends don't like it then you haven't got a chance! But they were really impressed so that was great.'

Millie's is a style that many try to emulate themselves with the Internet flooded with blogs instructing fans on how to get her look. When it comes to who she wants to see in her collection Millie has high hopes.

'Someone said to me today that they could see Cheryl Cole wearing it which would just be amazing! She would make the collection sell out! I could see Abby Clancy wearing it because the collection has a glamorous and girly feel.'

Other than celebrity aspirations Millie is looking forward to being able to wear the range herself after having to keep it under wraps for months. 

'I haven't been allowed to wear my collection until now! I have only just been allowed to have the samples that have been stored at the factory. 

'We were worried that people would see pictures of me wearing them and cheaper designers would create knock-offs really quickly which we really didn't want. I am in New York this week to see a few shows so it will be great to finally have my clothes to wear for that.' 

Despite her busy year, it appears that launching a clothing line isn't enough for ambitious Millie who also has plans to add author to her résumé.

'I have my lifestyle book coming out next year but I actually need to write it! I have a lot of travelling plans though so there will be no champagne and movies on the flight and instead I will just have to work and write the thing!'

For now though having finally realised her life long dream Millie says she couldn't be happier.

'I love my work. People always say love what you do for a living and I absolutely do, I am living the dream and it is a dream come true.' 

Millie Mackintosh's clothing collection is available in sizes 6-16 and  is available to purchase at www.millie-mackintosh.com as well as other major UK retailers from the October 15.
