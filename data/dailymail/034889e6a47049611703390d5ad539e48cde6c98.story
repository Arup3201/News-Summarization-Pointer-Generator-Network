The photographs show American users of cocaine, heroin, oxy-codone and crystal meth in various stages of addiction.

The before shots all show healthy-looking individuals prior to their becoming involved in substance abuse.

The after shots show the same faces with terrible, blotchy skin, gaunt and hardened features, wrinkled skin and wild eyes.

Chelsea was arrested four times in less than two years. In her final arrest she was charged with possession of cocaine, heroin and oxycodone.

The campaign was launched by Rehabs.com,
 the organisation that ran the very successful Faces Of Meth campaign in
 2012, which showed the devastating impact of meth addiction.

This latest campaign, More Than Meth: The Faces Of Drug Arrests, aims to show that drugs other than crystal meth can also have a damaging impact on health and appearance.

The photographs are mug shots of the drug users, who are known only by their first names, at the times of various arrests, which in some cases span more than ten years.
