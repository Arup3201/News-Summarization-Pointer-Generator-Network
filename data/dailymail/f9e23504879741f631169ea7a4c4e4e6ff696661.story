A mother-of-three who relies on benefits after being forced to give up her job due to cancer claims she can feed her entire family for £30 a week – and still shops at Waitrose and Marks and Spencer.

Deanne Wilson, from Headlingley, Leeds, had to leave her £2,000-a-month social care lecturer job after being diagnosed with throat cancer in February and now lives on £221-a-week state benefits.

However, despite her income being slashed by more than half, the 43-year-old has refused to let her family's eating habits slip and said: 'Just because I'm on benefits, why should I be feeding my children processed sugar?.'

Deanne Wilson (pictured with her family), from Headlingley, Leeds, was forced to give up her £2,000-a-month social care lecturer job after being diagnosed with cancer in February and now lives on £221-a-week benefits

She spends just £30 a week on food for her family and buys the majority of her groceries from Waitrose and Marks and Spencer. She buys produce which is heavily-discounted and bulks meals out with vegetables

Ms Wilson continues to shop at high-end supermarkets such as Waitrose and Marks and Spencer, and spends about £50 a month on designer clothes which she picks up from charity shops.

She said: 'I can feed my family on £30 a week. They even get extras and treats, but they're not rubbish and not processed.

'I have had no choice, and this was through no fault of my own.

'I go to supermarkets like Waitrose and Marks and Spencer. They reduce some of the good quality food at certain times of the day.

'Just because I'm on benefits, why should I be feeding my children processed sugar?'

Ms Wilson receives £221 a week in tax credit, employment support allowance and child benefits but insists it's easy to live off and she still manages to cook fresh, healthy meals every day.

Over the last few months she has managed to buy a selection of ten Marks and Spencer sandwiches for £1, a selection of organic Waitrose vegetables for less than £1, lamb steaks reduced to 5p from Asda and an entire grocery shop from Morrisons - that at full price would have cost £80 - for £12.

She said she uses the bulk of her budget to buy quality meat, before padding out meals with lots of fresh fruit and vegetables.

'The food is marked down because it's going out of date in a day or so, but because I cook everything fresh every day it makes no difference,' she said.

Ms Wilson shops around major supermarkets, including Tesco and Waitrose, for discounts. She mostly buys reduced produce, including M&S vegetables (left) and treats like Tesco olives (centre) and discounted cake

Her bargains include reduced M&S salad (left), cut-price M&S ham (centre) and fresh fruit and vegetables

The mother buys produce in bulk and shops at upmarket chains for end-of-the-day reductions on produce

'For one meal we might have good quality sausages with mash and lots of veg. All the nice veg, sometimes organic veg, sometimes not.

'I would make a chicken stew with lots of veg and then sometimes I would bake a cake.

'I have given my children the opportunity to know that just because we don't have money, it doesn't mean we can't eat good, proper food.'

Though her spending and grocery list changes from week to week depending on what is reduced at which shops, in a standard shop Ms Wilson would buy:

Fruit and veg - £4.50

Chicken - £4

Turkey - £4.50

Sausages - £1.50

Large bag of rice - £5

Bread - 50p

Milk - £3.50

Bottled water - 60p

Juice - 99p

Cheese - £1

Popcorn - £1

Total - £27.09 

Ms Wilson has even hit out at those who claim benefits and purposefully choose not to go to work, describing them as 'moaners'.

She said: 'People on benefits who can work need to go out to work. Life would be better for them. They need to get off their bums and go out and earn a living.

'People should go out to work and if they have children then they should go out to work once their children reach a certain age.

'I was used to a nice house, where my children didn't really go short of anything. I had the choice of whatever, and could provide for them.

'We went from that to having to survive on benefits which was a nightmare.

'I have never claimed anything before so I didn't know anything about it or what I was entitled to.'

She described the treatment she received while trying to sign on for benefits as 'abysmal', and said she puts it down to the amount of people claiming.

She said at one point, social services went to her home and checked her fridge, freezer and cupboards for food before she was given a £30 emergency payment so she could feed her children.

'It was absolutely appalling,' she said.

'They even asked my daughter what she was having for dinner to try and catch me out.

'I couldn't speak well and I was tired. I wasn't treated with any kind of sympathy.

'No-one got back to me. I didn't have any money or food for three weeks.

'I think they're just used to people giving them excuses. They're so used to people taking advantage of the system.

Ms Wilson buys everything from M&S vegetable mix (left) and salad (right) to meat and fishcakes (centre)

She also has bought discounted pasta (left), M&S garlic bread (centre) and Co-operative British pork (right) 

She managed to pick up this Marks and Spencer ciabatta loaf for just 80p in a reduced section of the store

The 43-year-old has been careful with her budget after her income was halved when she was forced to give up work in February due to throat cancer. Instead of receiving £2,000 a month, she now receives £221 a week

'The whole system is flawed and people take advantage, but then someone likes me comes along and gets treated abysmally, but it was through no fault of my own.'

Despite living on a tight budget, Ms Wilson said she spends £50 a month on designer gear for herself and her five-year-old daughter Amie, and decorates her house with luxury furniture.

By shopping for designer labels in charity shops, she said she can indulge her love of quality without the price tag. She has previously bought three dresses, two tops and a skirt for her daughter - all designer - for £30.

She dresses her daughter in Kenzo and Armani from charity stores, and some of her other favourite purchases include an Armani Coat bought for £9 and a Gucci Bag bought for £5.

'My daughter and I still manage to wear designer clothing,' she said. 'I call them boutiques but they're actually charity shops.

Ms Wilson, 43, also visits charity shops on a weekly basis, spending about £50 a week on designer clothes for herself and her five-year-old daughter

'I do try to save a little bit but my daughter and I get to wear the most amazing clothes.

'All my dresses are amazing.'

Her other secrets to saving money are buying in bulk and bartering with shops for a reduction in prices.

She added: 'I barter all the time. There was this table which was solid oak and meant to be £500 but I got it for £100. It's knowing the shops to go to. My bed was £1,000 and I paid £400 for it.

'It works a lot of the time and you've got nothing to lose. They can either say yes or no and they want the sale. I'll also go to Costco and buy things in bulk like washing powder and washing up liquid. It works out a lot cheaper. 

'The things I buy just aren't as extravagant.'

She also empties the coins from her purse into a jar at the end of the day and uses them to top up petrol, at supermarket self-service machines and to put towards days out for her family to places that charge minimal entry, like historic buildings.

She's now determined to keep putting the pennies away every day so she can take her family on holiday.

Depending on her health, Ms Wilson, who is also mother to Ben, 19, and Josh, 15, hopes to return to work as soon as possible.

She said: 'As it stands now I would like to go back to my teaching job because I have always worked, even when I had the children.

'I love my job and I love the children that I worked with.

'But at the moment I can't lecture for long because my saliva dries up. I get tired and sometimes it's hard to walk long distances.

'I hope my saliva comes back and my energy levels go up. I would like to go to work tomorrow but my body won't let me.

'It's been a learning curve for me. I don't have much choice but I do still have a good standard of living.'
