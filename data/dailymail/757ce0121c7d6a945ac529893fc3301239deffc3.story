If President Barack Obama could start his presidency over, he says he would have made closing the Guantanamo Bay military prison in Cuba his first order of business.

On his second day in office, Obama did sign an executive order seeking that the detention center for terrorism suspects be closed within a year.

President Obama made the comment about the prison during a speech to the City Club of Cleveland in Ohio on Wednesday.

President Barack Obama said he should have closed Guantanamo Bay prison on the first day he was in office

On his second day in office, Obama did order the detention center for terrorism suspects be closed within a year

The prison had 242 detainees when Obama began his presidency, but its population has been reduced to 122

He was responding to a question about what advice he'd give his inexperienced self, according to Politico. 

He said: 'I think I would've closed Guantanamo on the first day.

'I didn't because at that time we had a bipartisan agreement that it should be closed.'

The prison had 242 detainees when Obama began his presidency. 

According to Obama, the politics around closure grew increasingly tough and 'people got scared by the rhetoric.'

Obama made the comment during a speech to the City Club of Cleveland in Ohio on Wednesday.

He said Wednesday that 'the path of least resistance was just to leave it open.' 

He's been able to cut the population down to 122 detainees, but Congress has blocked the closure.

Lawmakers have banned the Obama administration from bringing detainees to the United States for imprisonment or trial.

In his State of the Union earlier this year, Obama repeated he wanted the facility closed,The Hill reported. 

He said: 'I will not relent in my determination to shut it down.'

Defense Secretary Ash Carter testified before Congress Wednesday that the administration needs to work with lawmakers to find a 'lawful' way to close the prison.

The delayed order to shut down the prison isn't the only thing Obama regrets. 

He also said he would have done something different with his hair if he could do it all again.

Obama joked: 'I was thinking maybe I should've told myself to start dying my hair now, before people noticed, because by a year in it was too late.

'Michelle thinks I look distinguished.'
