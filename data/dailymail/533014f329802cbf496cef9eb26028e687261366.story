The Abbott Government celebrates its first anniversary in power with the Prime Minister pledging to keep Australia safe in a time of increasing global uncertainty.

Tony Abbott returned to Sydney after a three-day visit to India and Malaysia to spend Father's Day and mark his first year in office on Sunday.

The prime minister said his government had delivered on its promise to tackle debt and repeal the carbon tax, and had signed two free trade deals with Australia's major trading partners Japan and South Korea.

Mr Abbott said the rise of extremism in Syria and Iraq and the downing of MH17 in eastern Ukraine had tested Australians like never before.

'As a nation, we've also faced serious challenges in the past year because of the increasingly uncertain world in which we live," Mr Abbott said in a video address to mark his first year as prime minister,' Mr Abbott said.

'In an increasingly uncertain world, we are determined that our nation will be secure.'

The prime minister has two reasons to celebrate on Sunday: He spends Father's Day with his dad in Sydney, as well as his one year anniversary in office

Mr Abbott has promised to spend an additional $630 million on counterterrorism measures to combat the threat of Australians returning home from battlefields in the Middle East.

While it will be a cause for celebrations, Mr Abbott has had unforgettable missteps that have overshadowed the prime minister's domestic agenda over the year.

It was the wink that sparked an outrage when he took to air-waves in May to discuss Budget matters with Gloria the grandmother.

The 67-year-old telephone sex worker told how the planned $7 GP co-payment and increased cost of medication would leave her out of pocket up to $850 a year.

'I would like to ask you if you'd like your mother or your grandmother to be in my situation,' she said.

'I'm a 67-year-old pensioner with three chronic incurable medical conditions – two life-threatening.

'I'm just surviving on around $400 a fortnight once I pay my rent and I work on an adult sex line to make ends meet. That's the only way I can do it.

‘What do you suggest I cut out Mr Abbott? Food, electricity, firewood, Christmas and birthday presents to my grandchildren? Or should I just die and get out of your way.’

While the prime minister forgot he was being filmed during the ABC Radio interview, he winked at radio host Jon Faine as the pensioner revealed she had worked on a sex line to make ends meet.

But it was his response to the surrounding death of Lance Corporal Jared MacKinney in Afghanistan, which got the prime minister in hot water.

Mr Abbot had been prone to shrugging off before suggesting to soldiers: ‘It’s pretty obvious that um... well, s*** happens doesn’t it?’

At least his Canadian Gaffe was a little more than embarrassing when he referred Canada as ‘CanADIA’ during his North American trip.
