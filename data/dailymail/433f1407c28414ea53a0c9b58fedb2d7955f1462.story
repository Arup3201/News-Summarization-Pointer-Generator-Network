An arresting series of photographs of breast cancer survivors bearing the scars of their battles with the disease depict the confronting reality of its aftermath on the body.

International fashion photographer David Jay started The SCAR Project in New South Wales' capital of Sydney after a close friend was diagnosed with breast cancer at 29 years of age.

The collection of colour and black-and-white photos depict the raw emotions of the survivors with their mastectomy scars who show them off with pride.

Fashion photographer David Jay started The SCAR Project in Sydney after a close friend named Paulina (not pictured) was diagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 29

The exhibition of photos is coming to Sydney on September 11 and will be shown at On Seven at David Jones on Elizabeth Street in the CBD

His friend, Paulina, had the surgery done within two weeks of being diagnosed and Jay described her as a 'beautiful, strong young woman'.

'I had taken Paulinaâ€™s picture a hundred times since she was 17,' he said.

'I saw her soon after her surgery and knew I would have to shoot her again.

'I took her picture because, perhaps as a photographer, taking pictures is my way of confronting, understanding and accepting the things I see.'

In his photos, Jay said the photos were not about breast cancer, it was about depicting the 'raw and honest' realities of young women

But National Breast Cancer Foundation chief executive Carole Renouf said The SCAR Project shattered the belief that young women did not get breast cancer

Jay knew the subjects had come to him to look beautiful but he did not want to destroy the 'visual integrity' of the photos

Despite National Breast Cancer Foundation (NBCF) bringing the project back to Australian shores, Jay was adamant the photos were not about breast cancer.

He said one of things the photos were about was reality and it was 'not always pretty'.

'The images can be uncomfortable for the viewer,' Jay said.

'It forces us to confront our fears and inhibitions about life, death, sexuality, sickness, relationships, et cetera.

'I once read it described as "unflinching".'

The fashion photographer said he had struggled to shoot The SCAR Project because he wanted the pictures to be 'raw, honest, sincere'.

'I knew why the subjects had come - they wanted something beautiful,' Jay said.

'They had already suffered greatly and although I desperately wanted to serve them, I knew in my heart that compromising the visual integrity of The SCAR Project for the sake of easily digested beauty would serve no one.'

Each year around 800 young Australian women under the age of 40 will be diagnosed with breast cancer and the likelihood of recurrence was higher in them

According to NBCF, the types of breast cancer affecting young women are often more aggressive and have a much poorer prognosis

NBCF chief executive Carole Renouf said The SCAR Project shattered the common belief that young women did not get breast cancer and depicted the striking reality of what it was like for young women to live with the disease.

'Each year around 800 young Australian women under the age of 40 will be diagnosed with breast cancer,' she said.

'Unfortunately the types of breast cancer affecting young women are often more aggressive and have a much poorer prognosis as well as a much earlier likelihood of recurrence compared to older women.

'We're grateful to David and the subjects of his portraits for the opportunity to share the raw reality of breast cancer with Australians.'

The exhibition will be displayed at On Seven at David Jones on Elizabeth Street in Sydney during store trading hours from September 11 to September 21.

Jay is an international fashion photographer based in New York and his friend Pauline (not pictured) was diagnosed with breast cancer and had a mastectomy just two weeks after she found out
