Change of approach: Caitlin Durkovich, assistant secretary for infrastructure protection at Homeland Security says the agency is also looking at environmental threats, not just terror

They're tasked with protecting the United States from terrorists and keeping America's biggest cities safe, but Homeland Security's brief appears to be widening to include more global issues like climate change.

The department that was created by President Bush in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks says that the role of the organization is 'to assist in the wake of disasters, whether they be man-made or natural'.

However, claims of 'mission-creep' are now being hurled at the department which is attempting to redefine its role as one of emergency management than of protection and security against enemies of the state.

Throughout it's 13 year existence, there has been persistent criticisms the department is wasteful, ineffective and has been far from transparent in how the agency is run, and how money is spent on a day-to-day basis.

In fact, claims of bureaucracy seems well-founded as the departments expanded role verges onto that of its partner agency, FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

It is exceptionally murky how the tasks of 'emergency management' are to be divided between the two government departments.

In the aftermath of 2012's Hurricane Sandy, which devastated large swathes of the Northeastern U.S  Durkovich said her department reviewed the task of rebuilding with a new focus on 'how to think about baking in resilience from the get-go'

'Increasingly, we've moved not only from a security focus to a resiliency focus,' said Caitlin Durkovich, speaking at a panel at the Rising Seas Summit, a three-day conference organized by the U.S.-based Association of Climate Change Officers to discuss tools and ideas on building resiliency, particularly against rising sea levels.

In the aftermath of 2012's Hurricane Sandy, which devastated large swathes of the Northeastern U.S and caused over $60 billion in damages, Durkovich said her department reviewed the task of rebuilding with a new focus on 'how to think about baking in resilience from the get-go.'

Now a team of specialists, including city planners, along with a partnership from the National Academy of Science to develop better tools for planning, are part of her team.

In New York, 'Hurricane Sandy really highlighted our vulnerability' to climate change, said panelist Daniel Zarrilli, director of the city Mayor's Office of Recovery and Resiliency.

Extra help: The Department of Homeland Security already has launched regional efforts to assess resilience of infrastructure and judge where gaps in adaptation and preparedness may be

The city is still recovering from the effects of the storm, which flooded most of its extensive shoreline, left tens of thousands without electricity for days, did billions of dollars of damage to infrastructure and killed 44 people, he said.

Scientists predict that climate change will cause more intense storms, frequent heavy precipitation, heat waves, drought, wildfires, extreme flooding, and higher sea levels. 

The Department of Homeland Security say this may alter the types and magnitudes of hazards that communities and emergency management professionals face, impacting mitigation, preparedness, and response and recovery operations.

The department is now working regionally to assess the resilience of infrastructure and judge where gaps in adaptation and preparedness may be, said Durkovich.

The agency has not specified if its enhanced role will affect the effectiveness of what it is best known for - to identify and curb terrorist threats to the homeland.
