It comes as little surprise that U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner may be planning a swift exit from his cabinet role - but perhaps the economist would have preferred that the announcement wasn't publicly aired in such an colorful way.

His father-in-law was allegedly overheard blabbing loudly about his son-in-law's political dealings in a crowded New York restaurant last week.

Geithner, 50, was apparently in line to become president of Ivy League college Dartmouth - with President Obama clearing the way by nominating current leader Jim Yong Kim for the top post at the World Bank last month.

The revelations came straight from the mouth of Albert Sonnenfeld, a food critic whose daughter Carole is married to Geithner.

The announcement was made by Mr Sonnenfeld at Bar Boulud, an upmarket eatery in midtown Manhattan, where diners sit together at communal tables to enjoy French bistro style food.

According to the New York Post, Mr Sonnenfeld identified himself as Geithner's father-in-law before making the remarks within earshot of strangers, saying he would be leaving his state department role at the end of the year.

He said: 'That’s why Obama nominated [Kim] for the World Bank - so that there’d be an opening.

'They offered him the presidency of Dartmouth. But now he doesn’t want it. He wants something else.'

He also let slip that his daughter Carole despised entertaining Republicans in Washington, adding: 'Can you imagine having to entertain John Boehner and his wife, with his fake tan?'

Mr Geithner's spokesman Anthony Coley told MailOnline today: 'Interesting theory about Dartmouth, but to paraphrase Kissinger - it has the disadvantage of being made up.'

Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi 
Okonjo-Iweala, a respected economist and diplomat, had also been a 
candidate to take over the World Bank before Mr Kim was awarded the 
role. Mr Okonjo-Iweala was believed by many to be more qualified for the position.

In January, Geithner already admitted that Obama was unlikely to ask him to take on a second term as Treasury Secretary if the President won re-election. 

'He's not going to ask me to stay on, I'm pretty confident,' Geithner said in a Bloomberg Television interview.

'I'm also confident he's going to have the privilege of having another Treasury secretary.'

Geithner is the only remaining top official on Obama's original economics team. He had considered leaving last August after the congressional battle over raising the debt limit was resolved.
