A pet dog that got trapped in a tiny six-inch gap between two walls has been rescued by twelve firefighters. 

Soap, a pole and webbing were used by emergency services after they were called to the house in West Hollywood around 3.40pm on Monday.

Los Angeles County Fire Department described the rescue as 'creative'.

They wrote on Facebook: 'Firefighters rescued a dog Monday afternoon that was wedged between a house and a retaining wall.

'Each time the dog would whimper or cry, he’d fall deeper into the six-inch gap. 

'As the dog moved, it would become wedged more tightly between the walls. 

'First responders were unable to break the walls to rescue the dog, so they got creative.'

Firefighters slid a pike pole, which is normally used to pull down ceilings during a fire, under the dog to prevent him from falling further. They then tied webbing around his paws and pulled him out (left; right after the rescue)

The dog, which was not injured, was reunited with his family.

A spokesman for the department said the incident was a 'great training opportunity for firefighters'. 

He added that the video from the incident may be used to train others who might encounter a similar situation in the future.
