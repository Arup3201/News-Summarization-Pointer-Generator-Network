Kim Jong-un has yet again proved that he is a hit with the ladies as he is swarmed by a group of female soldiers, all in tears at the prospect of meeting the North Korean leader.

The dictator impressed the ladies as he visited their artillery unit in the province of Kangwon, located on the border to South Korea.

The release of the images unsubtly coincides with the impending visit to South Korea by U.S. President Barack Obama, who lands in Seoul tomorrow.

Ladies man: An undated picture released on Thursday shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un surrounded by soldiers at a women's artillery unit in North Korea's southeastern province of Kangwon

The undated photographs show the young dictator surrounded by women in uniform, all battling to get a chance to touch their ‘dear leader’ while crocodile tears flood their eyes.

He is also seen observing a firing drill at the women’s artillery unit in south-eastern Kangwon.

The pictures were released by North Korean newspaper of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Rodong Sinmun, on Thursday.

Scenes of hysterical women surrounding Kim Jong-un are often seen in western media, as they form part of the ‘official image’ portrayed in handouts by the North Korean government.

A majority of images sent out by Rodong Sinmun are of a jolly-looking Kim Jong-un visiting military units and factories or inspecting his vanity projects such as a ski-slope and a summer camp for ‘high-achieving children’.

Dedicated fanclub: Kim Jong-Un is seen posing with female soldiers after he inspected what the official Korean Central News Agency described as a 'multiple-rocket launching drill of women's sub-units under Korean People's Army Unit 851'

Dear leader: Kim Jong-un visited the military base, located near the border to South Korea, to observe a firing drill

Leading man: The images of Kim Jong-un's visit to the military base were released on the day before president Barack Obama is set to land in Seoul on the other side of the border

Not the first time: This image was released last week, showing Kim Jong-un surrounded by female 'airpersons' of the Korean People's Army

The image release follows yesterday's report from the South Korean government that heightened activity had been detected at North Korea's underground nuclear test site, indicating possible preparations for another atomic test.

Barack Obama is due in Seoul on Friday, where he is expected to discuss ways to deal with North Korea's nuclear weapons programme.

And State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki admitted they were closing watching Pyongyang and the Korean pennisula.

She said: 'We have certainly seen the press reports ... regarding possible increased activity in North Korea's nuclear test site.

'We continue to urge North Korea to refrain from actions that threaten regional peace and security and to comply with its international obligations and commitments.'

North Korea warned last month it would not rule out a 'a new form' of nuclear test after the United Nations Security Council condemned Pyongyang for launching ballistic missiles into the sea.
