Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne has joked about his struggle with alcoholism but insisted he hasn't fallen off the wagon despite being pictured popping into an off-licence recently.

The 47-year-old, who was briefly sectioned for his own safety in October, appeared in good health as he appeared on BT Sport's Matchday Live With Fletch and Sav show yesterday.

Touching on his lengthy battle with drink and drugs, the former Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle midfielder joked: 'I've been on a whiskey diet – I lost three days!'

Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne appeared in good spirits on BT Sport's Fletch and Sav show

The 47-year-old appeared healthy with glowing skin and an eccentric grey beard during yesterday's TV stint

Gascoigne, who retired from football in 2004, was joined by fellow guest Russell Brand on the show and opened up about his struggles with alcoholism. He even joked: 'I've been on a whiskey diet – I lost three days'

The star, who put his recent stint in hospital following an apparent alcohol binge down to 'just to a little blip', insisted photos of him shopping in a off-licence last month didn't mean he had resorted to his old habits.

He told TV presenters Robbie Savage and Darren Fletcher: 'I was only buying cigarettes.'

Gascoigne, who retired from football in 2004, was spotted emerging from a branch of Oddbins in Poole, Dorset, in his slippers in January.

Wearing an oversized sheepskin coat, yellow t-shirt and jeans, he kept a carrier bag hidden as he left the convenience store.

And in December last year, he was spotted popping to an off-licence in east London, although it wasn't clear whether he bought anything at the store.

A month earlier he was pictured looking downcast as he put the bins out in front his property in the wealthy Sandbanks area of Poole, Dorset, wearing a blue dressing gown, tartan pyjama bottoms and slip-on shoes.

Despite his previous public struggles with alcoholism, Gascoigne appeared happy and relaxed on the sport show yesterday and teamed his new healthy, glowing appearance with an eccentric grey beard.

As well as making light of his dark times, the footballer also touched on the struggles of being in the spotlight.

He told fellow guests Jimmy Greaves and Russell Brand how his fundamental aim on a football pitch was to 'entertain the fans, win them over', but admitted that sometimes it all became too intense for him.

He also admitted that even today 'it's sometimes hard to go to games' because he ends up 'analysing myself.'

He added: 'I drive myself nuts. What would I have done there?'

It prompted comedian Brand, who has also struggled with alcohol and drug addiction in the past, to reassure the footballing great.

He turned to Gascoigne and told him 'the greatness is still in you,' before adding: 'You mustn't feel sad. You've given the game so much.'

Brand later said of the former footballer: 'He transcends clubs and football because he was such a beautiful player and a genius.'

TV presenter Gary Lineker took to Twitter to make a series of positive comments about Gascoigne's interview

Gascoigne's rare television appearance also appeared to be well-received by fans.

TV presenter Gary Lineker took to Twitter to make a series of positive comments about his interview.

He wrote: 'Gazza is on @FletchAndSav on @btsport and seems in good form. Now that fella could really play.

'Gazza was so good and loved having the ball so much he'd only pass it to you if you had no choice but to give it straight back to him.'

He later added: 'Great to see Gazza in such sparkling form. Love the lunatic.'

The former professional footballer's appearance on the show is one of his rare public outings since his hospitalisation in October last year, during which he was placed on a three-day emergency detox.

Gascoigne was spotted shuffling out of his local off-licence in a pair of slippers in January. Despite keeping the carrier bag hidden from view, he said during yesterday's TV interview that he had just bought cigarettes

The former England, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle footballer was also spotted emerging from an off-licence in east London in December last year. However, it was clear in the photos that he didn't buy booze

Last year, the ex-footballer was spotted looking downcast as he put the bins out outside his home in the wealthy Sandbanks area of Poole, Dorset, wearing a blue dressing gown, tartan pyjama bottoms and slippers

The star, who made 57 appearances for England, was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008 following an incident at a Newcastle hotel.

His latest sectioning in the early hours of October 24 came following an apparent alcohol binge.

During his time in hospital, he is said to have taken the opportunity to improve his health and fitness by doing up to 800 press-ups, sit-ups and squats every day.

Gascoigne, who now prays every morning, claimed he had only drunk for one year out of the last 18 and admitted he was lucky to have nipped his relapses in the bud quickly.

Last month, he admitted that 'the only person who can save me is me', and vowed to stay on the straight and narrow after listening to doctors' warnings that alcohol will kill him.
