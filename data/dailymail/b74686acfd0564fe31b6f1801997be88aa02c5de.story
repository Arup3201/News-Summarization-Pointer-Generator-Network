Four soldiers are dead after the Taliban used a remote-controlled bomb to blow-up a bus in Afghanistan today.

The terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack which was the latest in an onslaught on Afghan security forces ahead of the withdrawal of foreign combat forces at the end of this year. 

The soldiers were on their way to work when the bomb, buried in the road, was detonated as it passed by in southwestern Kabul, Ministry of Defence spokesman General Zahir Azimi said.

The bombing is the latest in a series of attacks against Afghan troops ahead of the withdrawal of foreign forces later this year

Twelve people were wounded in the blast, including six soldiers and six civilian passers-by, he said.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the group were behind the attack 'on the slave soldiers' bus'.

The Taliban are fighting to expel foreign forces and oust the U.S.-backed government.

Casualties among Afghan army and police have soared in the past year as national forces have taken over most of the fight against the Taliban and their jihadist allies.

The number of soldiers killed last year nearly quadrupled to 4,451 over the previous year for the Afghan calendar that ends in March, according to Ministry of Defence statistics.
