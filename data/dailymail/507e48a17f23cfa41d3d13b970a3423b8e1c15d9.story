A judge who sent a topless picture of himself to a court employee has kept his position, but received a public censure over the sexting scandal.

Wade McCree made headlines after the husband of a bailiff revealed that his wife had received an apparently erotic photograph of the judge.

Now the Michigan Supreme Court has criticised him for bringing 'shame and obloquy' on his profession and becoming the object of 'jokes and ridicule'.

Inappropriate: Judge Wade McCree sent this nearly nude picture of himself to a married court bailiff

McCree admitted in April that he had sent a naked picture of the top half of his body to court bailiff LaDawnn Malone.

He initially boasted of his physical fitness, memorably saying: 'I've got no shame in my game.'

But
the judge soon backtracked and issued a public apology, saying: 'I am 
embarrassed and truly sorry for my actions, which have hurt and caused 
great pain to my family.'

A
ruling issued yesterday by the Michigan Supreme Court allowed McCree to
keep his job, but ordered that he be publicly censured for his antics.

The
court declared that the judge 'conducted himself in a flippant manner 
and did not give the interview the seriousness he should have. As a 
result, he brought shame and obloquy to the judiciary.'

It
also referred to the worldwide furore over the photograph, noting: 'The
interview, and the digital image, spread rapidly around the internet 
and became the subject of jokes and ridicule.'

Nonchalant: Wade McCree, a specialist in sex misconduct cases on Detroit's 3rd Circuit, batted away claims sending a semi-naked shower picture via mobile phone was 'totally inappropriate'

Ms Malone apparently told officials 
she used the picture 'as inspiration to motivate her to improve her 
workouts and eating habits'.

A lawyer for McCree told FOX 2 his 
client was guilty only of explaining himself poorly, and admitted he 
should have behaved 'more judgey'.

In
April the judge, a specialist in sex misconduct cases on Detroit's 3rd 
Circuit, nonchalantly batted away claims the seedy semi-naked shower 
pictures sent by mobile phone was 'totally inappropriate'.

When approached by FOX 2,
he said: 'Hot dog, yep that's me. I've got no shame in my game. I ain't
talking to nobody else's wife. You can almost get that here and now.

'I've sent that out to other women. There's nothing nude about it. I'm in no more clothes than I'll be at the Y this afternoon when I swim my mile.'

McCree, who's appeared on the channel's Let It Rip show preaching self-respect, played down the incident.

His seemingly arrogant stance has angered his colleague's husband. The court bailiff's spouse said: 'It's totally inappropriate. It says a lot that he's flawed.

'He's not what he appears to be, at least not to the general public because he has access to kids, he has access to different charitable functions.

'He's been looked upon as some great figure but, as you can see according to the picture, you see what he's really all about. What kind of man would send this to a married woman, knowing he's a married man himself?'
