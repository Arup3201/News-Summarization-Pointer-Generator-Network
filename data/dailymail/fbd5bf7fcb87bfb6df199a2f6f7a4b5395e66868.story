Senior church figures and charities were left outraged after metal studs were  installed outside a luxury block of flats to deter homeless people from sleeping in the doorway.

The inch-high studs were added to the floor of an alcove by the main entrance to the flats in Southwark Bridge Road, South London,

It is thought residents complained to the building managers of rough sleepers using the space.

Serious issue: But some campaigners said that opponents were missing the point and argued that the real issue was a shortage of help for homeless people with mental health, drug and alcohol problems (file image)

But the move provoked a fierce debate 
when a picture was posted on Twitter by  well-known female priest,  the 
Rev Sally Hitchiner, who said: ‘Anti-homeless people studs.

'What a negative message to send out!’

She said: ‘It is an indictment that we are treating people  like pigeons.

'I feel very angry about it. It makes me feel quite ill.’

Rev Sally Hitchiner said the studs gave out a 'negative message'

Katharine Sacks-Jones,  head of policy and campaigns at homelessness charity Crisis, said rough sleepers deserved better than to be ‘moved on to the next doorway’.

However, residents of the imposing five-storey  apartment building, where a one-bedroom home costs in the region of £400,000, welcomed the move.

One, Estefania Moreno, said:  ‘I think it’s a good thing.

'There were people sleeping there and they made a mess.’
