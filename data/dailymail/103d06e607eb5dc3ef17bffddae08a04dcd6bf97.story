Four more costumed entertainers have been arrested in Times Square, as NYPD officers continue to crack down streets performers who harass tourists for money.

Two of the performers — HortencIa Aliaga, 42, of New Jersey and Luis Salinas, 20, of Queens — were nabbed Saturday night for blocking a sidewalk while trying to get tourists to take photos with them in exchange for money, a police source told MailOnline.

The other two — Jeanmarc Banga, 36, of Manhattan and Wilmar Suarez, 32, of Queens — were picked up on the same night for 'forcibly' grabbing pedestrians and 'aggressively' soliciting money from them, the source added.

Suarez also grabbed a female NYPD officer 'lifted her off the ground without her permission,' the source said.

The arrests bring to five the number of streets performers who have been swept by cops from Times Square just this weekend.

The fifth entertainer — Junior Bishop,
 25, of Brooklyn — was arrested Saturday for allegedly hitting a police 
officer who told him to stop harassing tourists. He was charged with 
assaulting an officer, resisting arrest and criminal mischief.

New
 York Police said the officer, one of about 50 patrolling the bustling 
tourist area, stepped in after Bishop demanded at least $5 from a woman 
he posed for a picture with, instead of the $1 tip she offered.

Police said a costumed Bishop 'put out his hand and told the woman 5s, 10s or 20s only.' Police said the officer told him he could only accept tips, not require payment.

Bishop yelled and cursed at the officer, police said, and told him: 'Mind your own [expletive] business.'

Police said the officer asked for identification and, when Bishop failed to produce any, moved to arrest him.

Bishop broke free and punched the officer in the face, police said, causing a cut and eye swelling.

The officer, whose name has not released, was treated and released at New York University's Langone Medical Center.

Other officers arrived and took Spider-Man away.

On an unrelated incident, performer Titus Gandy, 22 — known as the Black Naked Cowboy — was charged with possession of cocaine when he showed up at a Midtown police precinct to pick up a friend's car, according to a police source.

He was stopped on an open warrant and cops frisked him, finding an envelope and a straw, both allegedly containing cocaine residue, the source added. He was later released on a desk-appearance ticket.

'I
 didn't even know there was a problem,' Gandy said of the police crackdown in Times Square. 'After I take pictures with fans and oncoming 
traffic, they want to pay me.'

Bishop's mother answered the phone at their Brooklyn home late Saturday and said he was not there.

She said she was not aware of his work in Times Square or his arrest. Information on Bishop's lawyer was not available.

The arrest of Spider-Man, as police referred to Bishop throughout a matter-of-fact news release, came weeks after the New York City Council said it was considering legislation to regulate the costumed characters in Times Square.

It was the latest in a series of incidents involving men behind the masks.

In the last two years, a man dressed as Cookie Monster was charged with shoving a two-year-old, a person attired in Super Mario's overalls was accused of groping a woman, and an Elmo figure pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct after unleashing an anti-Semitic tirade.

Last month a different Spider-Man was convicted of harassment for a February 2013 episode in which he cursed and complained that a woman did not tip him after posing with her children.

Phillip Williams later punched the woman in the face and knocked her to the ground - out of self-defense, he said - after she hurled snow at him.

The bill under city council consideration would require licenses and background checks for costumed performers, but copyright issues have held up final approval because most of the costume wearers are not authorized by the characters' owners.

Police Commissioner William Bratton last week endorsed the measure to combat what he called Times Square's 'Elmo issues.'
