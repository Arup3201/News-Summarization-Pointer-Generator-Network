Pictures of the prosthetic arm fitted with a spork used by hook-handed British hate preacher Abu Hamza have been shown for the first time.  

Hamza, who was found guilty of terrorism and kidnapping by an American court in May, will be sentenced later today and could spend the rest of his life behind bars. 

Since he was extradited to the US in 2012, he has been detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New York where he was provided with the prosthetic spork. 

The image of the spork-hand has been included by Hamza's lawyers as part of an argument he should serve his time in a prison medical facility.

This picture of the prosthetic spork used by Abu Hamza in the detention center is part of an argument by his lawyers that he should serve his time in a prison medical facility - he will be sentenced later today 

Hamza was convicted in May last year of aiding a deadly kidnapping of 16 tourists in Yemen in 1998 and plotting to establish a jihadi training camp on an Oregon ranch in 1999 

They say his severe disabilities mean it would be wrong to send him to the high-security supermax prison in Florence, Colorado. 

His lawyer, Michael Bachrach, said: 'The accommodations that were ultimately provided to (Hamza) demonstrate the limitations in the ability of the MCC — or any standard, non-medical, (Bureau of Prisons) facility — to properly provide for (Hamza's) disabilities.' 

The Egyptian-born cleric famously demanded in 2013 a bidet be installed in his cell — a request that was not granted. 

Instead, the toilet in his cell was outfitted with a 'paddle' to help him more easily flush, according to documents.

Hamza was also charged with supporting the Taliban and Al Qaeda, in part by making his London mosque in Finsbury Park a breeding ground for radical jihadists 

Hamza, 56, whose full name is Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, will be sentenced by Judge Katherine Forrest at 10amEST (3pm UK time) today. 

It marks the final step in what was a 10-year legal saga to have Hamza extradited from the UK to face justice in the US. 

He was arrested by British police in 2004 at Washington's request and sentenced to seven years in jail in 2006 for inciting murder and racial hatred, before finally being extradited to the US in 2012.   

He was convicted last year of aiding a deadly kidnapping of 16 tourists in Yemen in 1998 and plotting to establish a jihadi training camp on an Oregon ranch in 1999. 

Hamza was found guilty of providing the kidnappers with a satellite phone, acting as an intermediary and dispensing advice by telephone from home. Four of the tourists - three Britons and an Australian - were killed. 

He was also charged with supporting the Taliban and Al Qaeda, in part by making his London mosque in Finsbury Park a breeding ground for radical jihadists.

His sermons were reportedly attended by 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui and shoe bomber Richard Reid.

It has also emerged that one of the brothers suspected of carrying out the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris was mentored by a terrorist linked to London’s notorious Finsbury Park mosque.

Cherif Kouachi, 32, met Djamel Beghal, 50, who was once accused of being Osama bin Laden’s main European recruiter, while in prison in Paris.

Beghal attended hate cleric Abu Qatada’s prayer meetings in London, and is also said to have been a ‘constant presence’ at the Finsbury Park mosque in the late 1990s, when it was Abu Hamza’s base. 

Hamza had denied the charges throughout and claimed his militant links were part of an attempt to find peace with extremists. 

Since he was extradited to the US, he has been detained at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC)

Abu Hamza al-Masri was born in Alexandria, Egypt in 1958 as Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, the son of a naval officer and a primary school headmistress.

After initially studying civil engineering he entered the UK in 1979 on a student visa.

He was granted UK citizenship when he met and married his first wife, a British Muslim convert, in 1980. Hamza has previously said she was the one who got him interested in Islam and he converted after taking time off from his job as a nightclub bouncer in London’s Soho. 

As he found his new religion and his job incompatible, he instead resumed his civil engineering studies at Brunel University and Brighton Polytechnic, gaining a degree.

He then divorced his first wife, the mother of his oldest son, Muhammed Kamel, who at the age of 17 was convicted of being part of a bomb plot in Yemen and imprisoned for three years in 1999.

He met and married his second wife in 1984 in a Muslim ceremony in London and had a further seven childen.

Heavily influenced by the Iranian revolution, he took an interest in Islam and politics, in particularly the occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union.

After meeting the founder of Afghan Mujahideen in 1987, he moved to Egypt and then to Afghanistan, and it was in the following years that he lost his hands and one eye.

Over the years, Hamza has given several different reasons for the loss of his hands and eye. These include a road project in Pakistan, an explosion during a de-mining project in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, fighting the jihad as a Pakistani Mujahideen, and working with Pakistani military in Lahore when an explosives experiment went wrong.

After spending time in Afghanistan and Bosnia in the early 90s, he returned to Britain and adopted a new name - Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri.

It was in London that Hamza began his rise to public notoriety as the Finsbury Park mosque imam, where he arrived in 1997.

One year later, in 1998, he helped organise hostage-taking of 16 mostly British tourists in Yemen. Three Britons and an Australian killed in rescue mission.

In 2000, he set up a terrorist training camp in Bly, Oregon, sending volunteers and money to Afghanistan to support al Qaeda and the Taliban.

He firmly placed himself on the national radar in 2001 after speaking out in support of Osama bin Laden following the September 11 attacks.

His inflammatory speeches led to the Charity Commission suspending him from his position at Finsbury Park Mosque the following year.

In 2003, legal moves begin to get Hamza deported to Yemen, a move which he appealed.

In 2004 Hamza was arrested on a US extradition warrant over charges of conspiring to take hostages in Yemen, funding terrorism, and organising a terrorist training camp in Oregon. Charged with 15 offences under the Terrorism Act, temporarily staying US extradition.

In 2006, Hamza was jailed for seven years at the Old Bailey after being found guilty of 11 of 15 charges, but the courts still battle to have him extradited.

He was finally extradited in October 2012, and appeared in a U.S. court, indicted under the name Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, where he pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges.

In May 2014, Hamza was convicted of all 11 charges on terrorism offences at Manhattan’s Federal Court. He will be sentenced later today.
