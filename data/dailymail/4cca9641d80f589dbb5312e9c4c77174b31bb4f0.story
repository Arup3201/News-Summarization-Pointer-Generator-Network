David Cameron is to demand an EU-wide crackdown on tax evasion and avoidance to boost revenues

David Cameron will today demand an EU-wide crackdown on tax evasion and avoidance in a bid to boost revenues amid fears the economy is flatlining.

He warns that global action is necessary to reclaim the ‘staggering’ amounts of revenue lost through aggressive tax avoidance and evasion.

The Prime Minister’s intervention comes as the Government discovers today if Britain plunged into a triple-dip recession in the first three months of the year.

Experts are predicting lacklustre growth figures on ‘a day of reckoning’.

Mr Cameron will use his chairmanship of the G8 in June to push for a worldwide crackdown on tax avoidance.

In a letter to European Union president Jose Manuel Barroso and European Council president Herman van Rompuy, he calls for countries to share information on tax affairs and tough new laws to force companies to reveal where their profits go.

Howard Archer, chief UK economist at IHS Global Insight, said: ‘In reality, it makes very little difference whether the economy expanded modestly in the first quarter, contracted marginally or was flat.

‘Regardless of whether further GDP contraction was avoided in the first quarter, it is evident that the economy is still finding it tough to generate even modest sustainable growth.’ Tory MPs have privately warned that Mr Osborne will face concerted demands for more action unless growth picks up soon.

Yesterday Mark Field, a close ally of Tory leadership hopeful Adam Afriyie, broke cover and accused ministers of being ‘complacent’ about the need for growth and warned that a loss of confidence from the markets would be ‘fatal’ to the coalition.

In an interview with London Loves Business, Mr Field said: ‘When it came in, the coalition was pretty complacent about growth. There wasn’t quite the urgency or passion to get things moving at the outset.

‘We still continue to flunk the decisions on big infrastructure projects like nuclear power. We’ll also fudge through on aviation. I don’t think it’s a very satisfactory situation.

‘Hitherto it has been George Osborne’s great success that the markets have been convinced we have a plan, but if market sentiment were to turn, it could be fatal.’

The Treasury and the Bank of England yesterday outlined plans to supercharge their Funding for Lending Scheme amid fears Britain is heading for a triple dip recession.

The beefed-up programme will see banks and other lenders offered £10 of cheap funding for every pound they lend to small business this year and £5 per £1 next year.
