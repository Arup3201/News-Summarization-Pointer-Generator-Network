In 1984 the American created a series of unique screenprints of Munch’s most famous pieces.

In
his unmistakable style, he recreated The Scream, the masterpiece 
described as ‘one of the most instantly recognisable motifs in both art 
history and modern culture’.

The artist made a number of changes to
the Munch’s original motif, emphasising the basic features of the 
figure to create a cartoon-like face and adding his own choice of bright
colours.
