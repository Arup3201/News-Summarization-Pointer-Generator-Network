England’s improbable quest to get back into this series was hampered by rain in Sri Lanka’s hill-country, but not before Chris Woakes confirmed his World Cup spot with six wickets.

The match will resume on Thursday at 2.30pm local time (9am in the UK), with England needing 240 on a turning Pallekele track to reduce the deficit to 3-2 in this seven-match series.

Since Sri Lanka have included four spinners in their team – including Sachithra Senanayake for his first game since remodelling an illegal bowling action – it will not be straightforward.

But the England management will take heart from the performance of Woakes, whose figures of six for 48 mean he can now boast two of England’s three six-wicket hauls in one-day internationals.

Woakes claimed six for 45 at Brisbane in January 2011, but England’s best one-day analysis remains an unlikely six for 31 by Paul Collingwood against Bangladesh at Trent Bridge in 2005.

And with Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad both set to return from injury in time for the World Cup, and Steven Finn having put his confidence-sapping Ashes tour behind him, the form of Woakes will convince England they can match other teams for seam-bowling depth in Australia and New Zealand.

Woakes’s first spell had been a below-par three-over burst costing 17 after Finn had removed Kusal Perera third ball for a duck, caught by Chris Jordan at second slip.

Alastair Cook then brought Woakes back for a two-over burst that produced the prized scalp of Mahela Jayawardene, driving carelessly to the reliable Jordan, this time stationed at a widish first slip.

But it wasn’t until his final spell that Woakes cashed in. In 2.5 overs he claimed five wicket for 19 runs, including Kumar Sangakkara, caught at deep midwicket by Joe Root after a typically classy 91.

Jeevan Mendis was caught and bowled after top-edging a pull on to his helmet, Senanayake was bowled, Thisara Perera caught at deep midwicket, and Ajantha Mendis bowled middle stump first ball. It meant Sri Lanka failed by six balls to bat out their 50 overs.

If Woakes picked up the wickets, he was grateful to James Tredwell – back in the side after missing out on the last two games so the selectors could take a look at Ben Stokes.

Tredwell conceded only 33 in 10 high-class overs and trapped Lahiru Thirimanne lbw for just eight – a useful retort to his puzzling omission from the fourth game on a turning pitch in Colombo.

Chris Jordan continued his rise with the prize scalps of Tillekeratne Dilshan and Angelo Mathews, but the England attack again let themselves down by bowling too many wides.

The 15 they sent down here took their tally for the series to a scandalous 56. Sri Lanka, in one innings fewer, have conceded 22.

But that will all be forgotten on Thursday if England’s batsmen – minus Alex Hales, who has been left out for the returning Cook – can chase down the runs.

ENGLAND: Cook (c), Ali, Taylor, Root, Morgan, Buttler, Bopara, Jordan, Woakes, Tredwell, Finn.
