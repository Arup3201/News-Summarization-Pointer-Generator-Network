Sectarian mobs brought violence and flames to the streets of Belfast in the city's worst riots for more than a decade.

Three men were shot and wounded in the clashes on Tuesday night and police were on stand-by for further trouble yesterday.

At least five shots were said to have been fired - one hitting a news photographer. Two other men were hit in the leg.

The last two days have seen pitched 
battles between loyalists and republicans in the Lower Newtownards Road 
and Short Strand, notorious flashpoint areas of East Belfast.

Police have blamed the loyalist 
Ulster Volunteer Force for igniting the violence on Tuesday night, 
apparently in protest at restrictions on parades through contentious 
areas during the forthcoming marching season.

Assistant Chief Constable Alistair 
Finlay said of the UVF: 'Their hands are upon this, whether by direction
by omission or commission.'

However the bullets are believed to have been fired by Republican sympathisers.

A woman of 20 was arrested last night
on suspicion of possessing a weapon and assaulting police but she has 
not been charged in connection with the shootings.

At least 400 rioters are said to have
attacked officers in East Belfast with petrol and paint bombs. Officers
responded by firing 66 baton rounds and water cannon.

At one stage, masked youths used 
sledgehammers to attack police vehicles, standing on the bonnets trying 
to rip protective grilles from the windscreens so they could reach 
officers inside.

Northern Ireland first minister Peter
Robinson promised that he was prepared to become 'directly involved' in
attempts to resolve the trouble in his east Belfast constituency.

'At this time, when many are working 
hard to build a better and brighter future for all in Northern Ireland, 
it is disappointing and deeply concerning to see this level of violence 
return to our streets,' he said.

Deputy first minister Martin 
McGuinness, blamed a 'small minority of individuals clearly determined 
to destabilise our communities. They will not be allowed to drag us back to the past,' he declared.

However, police fear the trouble may well escalate.

The Protestant marching season is a 
little over two weeks away and dissident Republicans have carried out a 
string of attacks on members of the security forces - including the 
murder of Roman Catholic policeman Ronan Kerr in Omagh less than three 
months ago.

The wounded photographer, Niall 
Carson of the Press Association, was in a stable condition at the Royal 
Victoria Hospital in Belfast after a bullet passed through his left leg.

Another photographer said he saw someone peering over a wall who then fired five or six rounds.

'We were all running,' he added. 'The next thing I know a colleague yells "I've been shot".'

Local MP Naomi Long said one man had been struck on the head with a brick, which fractured his skull.

She described the trouble as 'very serious' and said appeals from public representatives had fallen on 'deaf ears'.
