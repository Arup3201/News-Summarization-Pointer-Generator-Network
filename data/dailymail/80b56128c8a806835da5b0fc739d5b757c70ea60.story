This is the shocking moment a fuel thief sped from a petrol station with the manager clinging onto his bonnet.

Joshua Charnley, 19, concealed his number plates with black tape and used his car 'like a weapon' as he escaped the Texaco garage in West Kingsdown, Kent.

A court heard that Lekshmanan Asokkumar stood his ground and tried to stop him but Charnley scooped him onto his bonnet and left him clinging on as he sped away.

The teenager drove for half a mile with the garage boss hanging onto his car.

A fuel thief who sped from a petrol station with the manager clinging onto his bonnet for half a mile is facing jail. Lekshmanan Asokkumar stood his ground and tried to stop him but Charnley scooped him onto his bonnet and left him clinging on as he sped away

Charnley repeatedly swerved across the road and tried to punch his hands off before flinging him to the ground as he rounded a corner.

A court heard that Mr Asokummar, 59, suffered a fractured skull and liver damage and some of his injuries are likely to be permanent.

Charnley, of no fixed address, had 
admitted causing serious injury by driving dangerously -but had denied 
the more serious charge of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

The
 jury at Canterbury Crown Court took nearly nine hours before convicting
 him of the charge, which carries a maximum life sentence.

Charnley claimed he 'panicked' and drove away not intending to drive at his victim.

But Canterbury Crown Court heard that he had no intention of paying for the petrol during incident last July.

Martin Jarvis, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Asokummar stood in front of the car and put his hands up.Â 

'Charnley revved the engine and lurched the car forward on more than one occasion in an attempt to intimidate Mr Asokkumar.'

A furious Charnley began shouting at Mr Asokkumar - but the manager stood his ground to prevent them from leaving.

Mr Jarvis added: 'Charnley then drove off quickly, revving hard and spinning the wheels directly at Mr Asokkumar.

'He then drove his car into Mr Asokkumar, scooping him up onto the bonnet and travelling nearly half a mile with the retail manager clinging on.

'The car hit him, lifting onto the bonnet and Charnley then continued down the road at 30mph with Mr Asokkumar clinging to the car.

'As
 the car continued up the road, one eye witness described Charnley 
punching Mr Asokkumar's hands through the open window, while the car 
swerved from side to side.'
