A government minister today pleaded with civil servants to let him have a games console in his ministerial office.

Ed Vaizey revealed he had been told not to have gaming equipment wired up to his office TV because it would look ‘frivolous’.

But the Tory culture minister said he was going to ‘renew’ his campaign, arguing that it was connected with his day job.

Culture Minister Ed Vaizey has revealed his frustration at civil servants who will not let him have a games console in his office

As Minister for Culture, Communications and Creative Industries, the 44-year-old is responsible for policy affecting the gaming industry.

But the plea to try out the latest games in his government office will raise eyebrows at a time when other Conservatives have suggested that people work harder to get the economy growing.

He revealed that his requests for a console in his office at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, just off Trafalgar Square, were rejected by the ‘powers that be’.

He added: ‘I was encouraged not to, in case it looked frivolous,’ he told The Independent.

‘But I think I will renew my campaign. I have a television so why can't I have a games console?’

Ed Vaizey was an early player of the Angry Birds (left) iPhone game but Prime Minister David Cameron is a secret fan of Fruit Ninja on his iPad

For now, Mr Vaizey is making do with playing games on his iPhone.

Having first played Angry Birds – a favourite of Prime Minister David Cameron – he has progressed to Plants vs Zombies and now enjoys Monopoly on his iPad.

But Mr Vaizey admitted he was in the dark about the industry until Mr Cameron gave him the brief in opposition six years ago.

‘I knew nothing about gaming in terms of either doing games or its policy place.

‘The only time I heard about games in the policy sphere was about violence and banning games.’

As a schoolboy he played Asteroids and Space Invaders but was baffled by the complexities of Defender.

‘It was the game that put me off gaming - because I wasn't any good at it,’ he laments.

Earlier this year Mr Cameron was forced to defend the amount of time he spent playing games on his iPad, after it an advisor said the Prime Minister was addicted to the game Fruit Ninja where players swipe a sword at flying pineapples, melons and strawberries.
