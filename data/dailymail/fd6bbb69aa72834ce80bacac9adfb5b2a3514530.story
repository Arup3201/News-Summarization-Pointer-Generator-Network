A traffic warden has been sacked after he promised to help drivers escape their parking fine if they posed for a photograph.

Steven Jarvis convinced hundreds of motorists that he would assist their appeals if they appeared, holding their ticket, in a picture with him.

He collected more than 200 shots of bemused – but relieved – parking offenders during the two-and-a-half years he patrolled the streets of Brighton and Hove.

In the photographs, the 35-year-old warden can be seen smiling and giving a ‘thumbs-up’ alongside motorists and their tickets.

Mr Jarvis, who lives in a £250,000 two
bedroom flat in Brighton, intended to turn the pictures into a book but
he has now been sacked by the council’s contractor NSL.

He started taking pictures to defuse 
the tension when issuing fines. He said: ‘There’s always a whole 
different range of emotions when someone gets a parking ticket.

‘Some laugh it off, some are angry and
women would often be in floods of tears. There were attacks on other 
traffic wardens, but never on me.

‘Lots of traffic wardens just walk off
when someone asks why they’ve got a ticket. That just puts people’s 
backs up. But I was different – I’d talk to people and tell them I could
help them.’

Mr Jarvis told motorists that he could
not rescind their penalty but would back their appeal by making 
favourable notes in his pocketbook. All they had to do was to pose for a
picture with their ticket.

‘After that most people just relaxed. 
They were from all walks of life – doctors, builders, all sorts,’ he 
said. ‘But I didn’t give them any concrete assurances.

‘Being a traffic warden is all about having the right personality. The pictures were part of that, I guess.’

Mr Jarvis claims that bosses at NSL 
had known for more than a year before they fired him that  he was taking
the photos and had banned him from using his official work camera.

He 
said: ‘They pulled me upstairs and told me they weren’t comfortable with
me taking the pictures. But I just carried on, using my own camera.

‘I think the pictures are fantastic – 
they’re really funny. I showed some of my colleagues my pictures and 
they said I should put them in a book.

‘Every day they would ask me if I had taken any pictures of any photogenic people.’

NSL said Mr Jarvis had been sacked partly for taking the pictures but also for ‘other reasons’.

‘This was an isolated case. We are 
still investigating the incident but it is clear Mr Jarvis wasn’t 
meeting the standards we expect from a traffic enforcement officer,’ a 
spokesman said.

‘Appeals have to meet special criteria and the pictures would have had no effect.’

Publishing the pictures in a book was a
‘non-starter’, the firm said. ‘These photographs were taken in work 
time and remain the property of NSL.’

Mr Jarvis insisted: ‘The pictures are 
mine, I took them with my camera, so I’m definitely going to do the 
book. They can’t stop me.’
