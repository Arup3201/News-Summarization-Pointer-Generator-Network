Germany and Brussels are locked in a legal battle over benefits for migrants.

EU mandarins have backed the case of a Romanian who was refused some payments because she had not been in the country long and was not seeking work.

But German politicians say this encourages benefit tourism and risks turning their country into a ‘self-service store’ for migrants.

Romanian immigrants gather on the streets of Duisburg. Leaked comments made by the EU commission to the European Court suggest Germany will be ordered to make it easier for migrants to claim benefits

When the 24-year-old Romanian – 
identified only as Elizabeta D – arrived in 2010 she successfully 
applied for child benefit for her son and for a single-parent grant.

But
 her application for ‘Hartz IV’ payments, which are targeted at the very
 poor, was turned down because she was not trying to find a job.

The 
case went to a domestic court and was referred to the European Court of 
Justice in Luxembourg.

Leaked submissions from the Commission to the 
court show it believes it is too difficult for immigrants to claim the 
benefits – making a breach of EU law.

Pressure: The revelations have sparked a furious outcry from one of Chancellor Merkel's most important coalition partners

The case, which is pending, has caused major ructions in the ruling coalition headed by Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats.

Their
 coalition partners, the CSU, have accused the commission of ‘Eurocratic
 madness’. It has called for a freeze on all  benefits for newcomers.

Andreas
 Scheuer, general secretary of the CSU, said: ‘The national social 
security systems are not a self-service store for all those Europeans 
who come to us.

‘It is shocking for me to see the EU Commission 
torpedoing the national protection systems in this manner. If officials 
want to intervene from their deluxe offices on our national social 
security systems  then there will be bitter resistance from the CSU.’

Markus Ferber, a CSU MEP, said: ‘The national social security systems are and remain the responsibility of the nation states.’

The
 case echoes political rows in the UK, which is also facing a series of 
legal challenges from the EU over payments to migrants.

A spokesman for the EU  Commission said its submissions had been misunderstood.

‘Insinuations
 and accusations that the EU Commission urges Germany to pay social 
security benefits to all unemployed citizens in the country are 
completely wrong,’ she added.

‘There are strict safeguards in EU law to prevent so-called social tourism.’
