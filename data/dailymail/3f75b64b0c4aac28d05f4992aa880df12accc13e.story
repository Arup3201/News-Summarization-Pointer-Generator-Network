Louis van Gaal could not have wished for a better start at Manchester United. 

From the 7-0 opening win over LA Galaxy to the victory over Liverpool in Miami, Van Gaal returns home with the Chevrolet Cup, International Champions Cup and, most importantly, an unbeaten record. 

Here are five things Sportsmail have learned from United’s tour of America...

Confident: Louis van Gaal (right) seems to have already transformed United back into a winning team

Meeting of minds: Van Gaal speaks to his coaching staff after the pre-season friendly between United and Liverpool

1. Van Gaal is a winner. It sounds a simple enough quality but one that cannot be underestimated at United after the club’s shocking decline under David Moyes. 

The Dutchman has taken largely the same group and transformed them into a team which, even at this early stage, will clearly be a very different proposition. 

Whether it was the faultless penalties in the shootout win over Inter Milan or the character shown to come back and beat Liverpool, United are already playing for their new manager and that is half the battle.

Not giving in: United came from behind to defeat Liverpool in their latest pre-season friendly

2. The Dutchman is not scared to make radical changes. The new 3-4-1-2 formation is quite a departure from United formations under Sir Alex Ferguson and Moyes, but Van Gaal believes that is the best system to get the most out of the players at his disposal. 

Rather than simply throwing money at new signings, he is prepared to alter the fundamental line-up of the team to suit the players he has. 

Those who don’t fit into his plans – Fellaini, Nani, Anderson, Hernandez and Kagawa – will not be kept hanging around. They will be shipped out at the first opportunity.

On the move? Van Gaal looks set to allow several players to leave the club, including Marouane Fellaini (above)

3. Wayne Rooney is onside with the new regime. Having almost left United in Ferguson’s final season because of the favouritism shown towards Robin van Persie, and then been cajoled back into line by Moyes, there were concerns that Van Gaal’s close relationship with Van Persie would alienate Rooney all over again. 

Instead, he has scored five goals on tour, won the Most Valuable Player award at the International Champions Cup and impressed the manager to such an extent that he is set to be named captain ahead of Van Persie. 

You only had to listen to Van Gaal and Rooney speaking about one another in Miami to see that the England striker is happy with the situation.

4. Juan Mata is United's first choice No 10. Ignore the fact he wears No.8, Mata’s deployment in that role behind two strikers in Van Gaal’s new formation on tour shows that he has the manager’s faith. 

He never looked comfortable playing in a wider position under Moyes following hsi £37.1million move from Chelsea, and there were even questions about his future at Old Trafford when Van Gaal came in. 

But Mata has benefitted from the manager’s willingness to mould the system around the players he likes, and the Spaniard appears much happier in the new system. Kagawa, on the other hand, has been deemed surplus to requirements.

In the middle: Juan Mata will be United's first choice No 10 after a good pre-season with Van Gaal's side

5. Ashley Young has a future at United after all. If you had to draw up a list of players likely to leave Old Trafford if Moyes had stayed at the club, Young would have been towards the front of the queue right behind Anderson. 

Even when Van Gaal took over, his aversion to using out-and-out wingers meant that Young, Nani and Wilfried Zaha were immediately under threat. 

Young has tried to reinvent himself as a wing-back in the mould of Antonio Valencia, even though his defensive deficiencies were exposed by Raheem Sterling against Liverpool. 

That is something he needs to work on, but going forward Young was a real threat and looks like he has a new lease of life at United.
