Sudan, a country ravaged by a brutal civil war that claimed more than 2.5 million lives over five decades, was finally split in two in 2011.

And the world's newest country is now home to the world's newest national football team, dubbed the African Tigers by besotted fans.

Zoran Djordjevic - an impassioned and eccentric Serbian football coach who has worked with 14 national teams, including Bangladesh and Yugoslavia - was invited by the Ministry of Sport and Culture to take charge.

So, despite the fact he had never heard of South Sudan, Zoran travelled to the country and set off immediately on a scouting mission.

And there he discovered the obstacles faced by South Sudan's very first national football team to be world's apart from those tackled on the pitches of other countries.

Young British documentary filmmaker Sam Benstead was in South Sudan when he heard about a determined coach who claimed he would find his new team a place in the 2014 World Cup, so he travelled to the capital city of Juba to meet him.

Patriotic: A picture taken on June 26, 2012 shows South Sudan national football team's coach Zoran Djordjevic looking at his players as they put their left hands over their hearts before shouting 'Long live South Sudan' as part of a ritual performed before and after a training session, in Juba

The coach and his team: Zoran soon discovered that the problems faced by a football team in South Sudan would be quite different to any he had faced before

Chabur Goc Alei, the newly appointed President of the Football Association of South Sudan, told Benstead that the formation of a federation and a national team 'brought great hope to South Sudan'.

One talented young player said: 'Death became a way of life in Sudan. We are not 
politicians, we are just footballers, but our sport can bring 
peace to a town full of war.'

But a lack of funding meant that Zoran - who says he will give everything, even 'money and blood' to motivate his team - set off to scout for players... on a public bus. And without a road map.

'This is not Europe there is no map,' he was told by local people.

Zoran named his team The Tigers ('We are tigers, champions, winners, real men!'), but soon learned that even tigers couldn't demolish the problems faced by such a new country.

For once he had collated a team of talented young men and played their first match, the South Sudanese government announced they were ceasing oil production in order to cut off the dependent North.

Austerity measures cut all funds for Sports and Culture, and Zoran was not paid for six months. He appealed to the ministry but to no avail, by which time he was struck down by malaria.

And though he survived to care for his sheep, Champion, the team mascot; one of his players did not.

Eventually the new pitch was locked, Zoran and his team left with nowhere to play, and the passionate Serbian declaring: 'The country is sabotaging these young people who have great spirit, great talent, and great willing. And this is criminal in sport.'

Benstead's film explores the courage and determination of Zoran and his players, and the challenges they face in continuing to play national football in such a young and, once again, dangerous country.
