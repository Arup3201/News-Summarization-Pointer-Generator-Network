Exiled former master spy and traitor George Blake, whose betrayal of British agents to the KGB is said to have cost many lives, claims the ‘happiest years’ of his life are being spent in Putin-controlled Russia.

In a rare interview marking his 90th birthday, the former MI6 officer recalled sharing cocktails, including martinis - favoured by James Bond - with fellow spies outside Moscow in their KGB retirement.

Nearly five decades after he escaped from a British jail and was smuggled to East Berlin in a camper van in one of the classic cloak-and-dagger stories of the 20th century, Blake lives quietly in the Moscow suburbs with his wife Ida on a pension from the KGB.

‘These are the happiest years of my life, and the most peaceful,’ Blake, who goes by the Russian name Georgy Ivanovich, said in the interview, published in the Russian government newspaper Rossiskaya Gazeta .

‘When I worked in the West, I always had the risk of exposure hanging over me. That is how it was. Here I feel free,’ said Blake, who will be joined in his birthday celebrations by three sons travelling from the UK and nine grandchildren.

There was no sign of regret or remorse for his duplicity and he appeared content with the life he forged after being exposed with fellow traitors Donald Maclean and Kim Philby as among the most ‘significant’ spies of the Cold War years.

A balding man with a grey beard, cradled his pet dog on his lap, as he said : ‘Looking back on my life, everything seems logical and natural.

‘I have known how to adapt well wherever life has taken me, even when I was in the (Wormwood) Scrubs prison. I always try to find something positive ... I inherited it from my mother. She was always very positive, optimistic, always in a good mood.’

That escape in October 1966 together with two anti-nuclear protestors caused a sensation and despite a massive manhunt, he was able to be smuggled back to Russia.

Blake worked for the British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, from the 1940s. He became a committed communist while a North Korean prisoner during the Korean war, and worked for Moscow after being posted by MI6 to Berlin in 1955.

Over nine years working for the KGB, he is believed to have betrayed the names of more than 40 British agents to the Soviets. Many disappeared, and were thought to have been executed - he insists none died as a result of his betrayal.

His actions devastated British secret service operations in the Middle East. He is believed to have passed on the names of almost every British agent working in Cairo, Damascus and Beirut.

After he was exposed in 1961 by a Polish defector as a Soviet spy, he was sentenced to 42 years jail.

But he broke out of prison five years later with the help of other inmates. He hurt his arm during the escape jumping from the wall of the West London top security jail, and was smuggled out to East Berlin in the secret compartment of a camper van.

‘Look, you can still see the traces (of the fracture),’ Blake told Rossiyskaya Gazeta, holding up his arm.

Blake, who was awarded a medal by President Valdimir Putin in 2007, said nothing about contemporary politics in Russia.

Like Putin, who also served as a KGB spy in East Berlin, Blake holds the rank of lieutenant colonel in the ex-Soviet agency.

Blake’s case was among the most notorious of the Cold War, alongside those of a separate ring of British double agents known as the Cambridge Five.

Blake knew two of the five, Maclean and Philby, during his retirement. At one point in the interview, he reminisced about drinking with his mother and Philby.

He said he was closer in spirit to Maclean, the member of the group known to have adjusted best to life in Russia. Maclean died in Russia in 1983, and Philby in 1988, leaving Blake the most famous Cold War turncoat to outlive the Soviet Union.

Of the rest of the Cambridge five, Guy Burgess died in Russia in 1963, while art historian Anthony Blunt confessed in secret, received immunity from prosecution and was exposed only decades later, to die in disgrace in London in 1983.

The identity of the ring’s ‘fifth man’ has never been confirmed - but recent claims emerged saying it was Andrew Gow, who tutored George Orwell at Eton.

Asked about how he had passed on information to Soviet contacts while in Berlin, Blake said he travelled to the Soviet controlled sector of Berlin on a rail link joining different parts of the divided city.

‘I met a Soviet comrade about once a month,’ he said, explaining that his contact would be waiting for him in a car and they would go to a safe house.

‘I handed over films and we chatted. Sometimes we had a glass of Tsimlyansk champagne (Soviet sparkling wine).’ Blake said his three British sons would travel over to Russia for his birthday. He also has a son who was born and lives in Russia.

In 1990, he published his autobiography, No Other Choice, for which he received about £60,000 from the book’s British publisher before the government stepped in to freeze the remaining £90,000 he had been promised.

Thirteen years later, he accused the British government of breaching his human rights by confiscating the money. He was awarded £5,000 compensation in September 2006.
