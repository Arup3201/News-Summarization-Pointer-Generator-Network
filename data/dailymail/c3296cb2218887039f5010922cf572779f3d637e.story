They say that a dog is man's best friend, but one lizard is looking to put that record straight.

Buddy the rock iguana has been trained to come when called, enjoys being petted, and even wears a collar when he's taken out for walks in the local park.

In this footage posted online, Dave Durham, a lizard breeder from California, calls his pet over before giving him a pat on the head.

Buddy also has a stuffed toy that he plays with, and sleeps in a kennel in Mr Durham's garden.

Mr Durham claims to have been raising lizards for over 40 years and has more than 400 videos on his YouTube channel.

In other clips, Mr Durham calls another lizard named Bruce up on to his shoulder, and convinces him to crawl into his hands.

Rock iguanas are native to the West Indies and the species is named cyclura from the Greek cyclos meaning circular and oura meaning tail - referring to the rings on their tails

Mr Durham also says he is one of the first people in the U.S. to start breeding Blackthroat Monitors, a very large lizard, and Green Iguanas, similar in size to Buddy.

Rock iguanas are native to the West Indies and are named cyclura, from the Greek cyclos meaning 'circular' and oura meaning 'tail', because of the ringed markings on the tail.
