Private schools should be doing more to attract ‘skinheads with tattoos’ for their bursary places amid a lack of white working-class ambition, a leading headmaster has claimed.

Richard Russell said the white working class does not seem to be as ‘spontaneously interested in success and upward mobility’ as Asian, Afro-Caribbean and Eastern European families are.

But the head of Colfe’s School in Lee, South-East London, a  co-educational day school for three to 18-year-olds, argues that more needs to be done to engage with this group.

Headmaster Richard Russell says there are young clever white working class children who are missing out on private school bursaries

He spoke out as it emerged that elite private schools are struggling to recruit clever white working-class boys to their means-tested bursary schemes because of a lack of parental aspiration.

Some of London’s leading independent schools have already taken out newspaper advertisements, telling parents they could claim bursaries if their children pass the exams.

Mr Russell said he saw ‘a lot of aspiration’ from Conisborough College – the state comprehensive that Colfe’s School supports in Catford – ‘but it’s 90 per cent Afro-Caribbean’.

He added: ‘It’s these little skinheads with the St George’s Cross tattoos who come from families where maybe nobody has worked – I don’t think we are getting to the white working class as successfully as we should.’

Mr Russell said his local area had a large immigrant population, so applicants were partly reflecting its social make-up – only 39 per cent of school-age children in the London borough of Lewisham are white.

He added: ‘I see them around. There are plenty of white kids out there. Some of them must be bright. 

'We see lots of white working-class boys and girls around the place, but a genuine concern is they are not aiming high enough.’

Mr Russell was speaking following a social mobility seminar at the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) in Belfast on Tuesday.

Dr Joe Spence, headmaster of Dulwich College, South London, which sponsors an academy on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, a predominantly white working-class area, told the seminar: ‘Shouldn’t we be talking about aspiration?

In June, Ofsted warned that white working-class boys risked missing out on a decent education or career because of an 'anti-school culture'

‘We have masses of Asian candidates for our scholarships, Afghan refugees, but it is difficult to find white working-class boys.’

His concerns were backed up by David Levin, headmaster of the City of London School, whose eight full means-tested bursaries for Year Sevens received 268 applicants this year.

He said: ‘The biggest group of applicants is Sri Lankans, followed by the Indian subcontinent.’

In June, Sir Michael Wilshaw, Ofsted’s chief inspector of schools, warned that white working-class boys risked missing out on a decent education or career because of an ‘anti-school culture’.

Referring to a newspaper article that highlighted the lack of ambition in white, working-class areas, he said that historically there used to be a ‘real respect for education’ in these communities.

He said: ‘We need to bring back ambition to communities that lack aspiration. Schools too often have to try to pick up the pieces where society has failed.’

A 2007 report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation found that white working-class British boys accounted for almost half of those leaving school with low qualifications or no exam successes at all.
