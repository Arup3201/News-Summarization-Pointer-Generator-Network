The challenges they have faced could not be more different – but their victories are equally remarkable.

Two British athletes took gold medals as the Paralympics got off to a glittering start yesterday.

Cyclist Sarah Storey, born without a functioning left hand, stormed to victory in the 3km C5 individual pursuit.

And less than two hours later, swimmer Jonathan Fox, who has cerebral palsy, did the same in the S7 100m backstroke.

On an inspiring day of record-breaking performances, Fox's achievement made him the first British Olympic or Paralympic athlete to win gold in the pool.

And while Team GB failed to win a single medal on the opening day of the Olympics, Paralympics GB took seven, with three silvers and two bronze as well as the two golds.

The team is hoping to go on to beat its record haul of 102 medals in Beijing.

Storey, 34, was cheered by record crowds as she took her 19th Paralympic medal in two different sports.

She has now won five golds in swimming and three in cycling, with the prospect of a further three in this year's Paralympics. She capped her win with a lap of honour as the crowd, which included deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Lord Coe, continued to roar their support.

Later, the Paralympic team's spectacular start was sealed when Fox made a splash in the pool. The 21-year-old, who won silver four years ago in Beijing and had broken the world record in the semi-final heats, said the medal was his 'life's dream.'

Elsewhere, cyclist Mark Colbourne, 42, collected silver in the men's individual 1km Time Trial just three years after suffering appalling injuries when he plummeted 40ft to the ground in a paragliding accident.

In the pool, 16-year-old Hannah Russell, who has achondroplasia, a form of dwarfism, won silver in the women's S12 400m freestyle. Her achievement was matched by Nyree Kindred, 31, in the S6 100 backstroke, as her 15 month-old daughter Ella watched – and there was a special cheer from the crowd when she picked up the little girl after the race.

Moments earlier spectators had watched in awe as Kindred was beaten to the gold by Chinese swimmer Lu Dong, who has no arms and clenches a towel in her teeth at the start because she cannot hold the edge of the pool, in a world record time.

It was one of a catalogue of extraordinary superhuman performances by athletes that had spectators spell bound across Paralympic venues.

They included world records set in the Velodrome by cyclists with only one leg and a cyclist with no arms.

With virtual sell-out crowds across all Paralympic venues, the excitement and atmosphere that made the Olympics such a triumph was quickly recreated as spectators turned out in their tens of thousands.

Once again the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were among the biggest cheerleaders, with visits to see the British team in the goalball in the Copper Box and then to the Velodrome where they witnessed Storey smash the world record.

To the delight of the highly vocal 6,000-strong crowd, Kate and William joined in with a slow motion Mexican wave, alongside Sophie, Countess of Wessex, and her daughter Lady Louise Windsor.

The eight-year-old was a bridesmaid at Kate and William's wedding, and Kate displayed her continued close relationship with the Queen's granddaughter as she leaned in to talk to her at the event.

Kate and William both dressed casually – her in a red Paralympics GB polo neck, him in a blue one – and wore matching red training shoes. Earlier, they had made a brief visit to watch the GB men's goalball team play Lithuania at the Copper Box, where Kate arrived wearing a blue Paralympics GB sweat top. Her outfit was completed by a pair of navy jeans.

The pair looked fresh-faced despite a late night at the spectacular opening ceremony. Viewing figures released by Channel 4 showed the ceremony drew a peak audience of 11.2million – the broadcaster's biggest in a decade, and four times that of the opening in Beijing four years ago.

Craig Spence, the International Paralympic Committee's director of media and communications, hailed the 'fantastic' ceremony  a success.

He said: 'It gave a reflection of all impairment groups and I think it showed how far the Paralympic movement has come.'
