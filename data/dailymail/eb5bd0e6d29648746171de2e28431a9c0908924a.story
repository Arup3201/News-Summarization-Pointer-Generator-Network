A council has said it will cancel a 
village hall’s rate subsidy if it hosts a speech by British National 
Party leader Nick Griffin.

Mr Griffin is due to give a talk  at Baldslow Memorial Hall in  St Leonards, East Sussex, today.

But Hastings Borough Council has told
 those who run the hall they will have to repay the £376 they received 
as a charity in rate relief if the speech goes ahead.

Controversial: Nick Griffin's planned speech in St Leonards is at the centre of a storm between a village hall and its local council

However the council has been accused of trying to 'blackmail' the village hall.

Hastings Borough Council leader Jeremy Birch said the local authority was 'committed to equality of opportunity and to community harmony.

He added: 'We have no intention of providing financial subsidy to those who aim to undermine these principles.'

BNP party spokesman Simon Darby said: 'It's quite beyond belief what they are trying to do.

'They're basically seeking to tax people 
who don't agree with the Labour Party, which is not really the British 
way to do things.

'It's effectively blackmail, putting a gun to the people that run the hall by giving them a financial penalty if Nick is allowed to speak there. He's an MEP, he's not some person off the street.'

Councillor Birch said he had been approached by members of the community who were unhappy at Mr Griffin's appearance.

He went on: 'We have discretion about providing an element of business rate relief to charities.

'Here we have a charity that is providing a platform within its community building to the national leader of a political party committed to challenging these principles.

'If the charity wants to run a community facility for genuine community groups like Cubs, Scouts etc then it can withdraw the booking from the BNP and the council will reconsider the business rates.'

Earlier this month Trinity College Dublin was forced into a U-turn on plans to have Mr Griffin join a debate on immigration.

The university said it could not guarantee the safety and wellbeing of staff and students and warned the party leader he would not be allowed on its campus.
