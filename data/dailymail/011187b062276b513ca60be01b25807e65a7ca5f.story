Richard Ramirez, who spent 24 years in prison after a spree of demonic murders in California, died Friday, but not before turning a shocking shade of green.

The serial killer, who left satanic signs at murder scenes and mutilated victims' bodies during a reign of terror in the 1980s, died reportedly after 'sitting up in his bed doing stretches' just the day before at Marin County Hospital.

Ramirez, 53, had been taken from San Quentin's death row to a hospital where authorities said he died of liver failure.

This, according to a source at the New York Post.

The source said the self-proclaimed Satanist exhibited the ghastly-hued skin Thursday and was up and moving around his hospital bed.

'He was the color green,' said the Post's source. 'He looked like a green highlighter pen.'

He had been housed on death row for 
decades and was awaiting execution, even though it has been years since 
anyone has been put to death in California. He was convicted in 1989 of 13 murders, five
attempted murders, 11 sexual assaults and 14 burglaries, which 
terrorized Southern California in 1984 and 1985. His charges included 
rape, sodomy and oral copulation.

Though he died of liver failure, the exact cause of the ailment has not been released due to federal patient privacy laws.

At his first court appearance, Ramirez raised a hand with a pentagram drawn on it and yelled, 'Hail, Satan.'

Ramirez (pictured left, 2007, and right, in 1984) was convicted 
of 13 murders that terrorized Southern California in the 1980s, and 
was sentenced to death

His marathon trial, which ended in 
1989, was a horror show in which jurors heard about one victim's eyes 
being gouged out and another's head being nearly severed. Courtroom 
observers wept when survivors of some of the attacks testified.

Satanic symbols were left at murder 
scenes and some victims were forced to 'swear to Satan' by the killer, 
who entered homes through unlocked windows and doors.

Ramirez was finally run down and 
beaten in 1985 by residents of an East Los Angeles neighborhood while 
attempting a carjacking. They recognized him because his picture had 
appeared that day in the news media.

The trial of Ramirez took a year, but 
the entire case which was bogged down in pretrial motions and appeals 
lasted four years, one of the longest criminal cases in U.S. history.

Because of the notoriety of the case, more than 1600 prospective jurors were called.

After his conviction, Ramirez flashed a two-fingered 'devil sign' to photographers and muttered a single word: 'Evil.'

On his way to a jail bus, he sneered 
in reaction to the verdict, muttering: 'Big deal. Death always went with
the territory. See you in Disneyland.'

The black-clad killer, unrepentant to 
the end, made his comment in an underground garage after a jury 
recommended the death penalty for his gruesome crimes.

Inexplicably, Ramirez, a native of El 
Paso, Texas, had a following of young women admirers who came to the 
courtroom regularly and sent him love notes.

Some visited him in prison, and in 
1996 Ramirez was married to 41-year-old freelance magazine editor Doreen
Lioy in a visiting room at San Quentin prison.

Relatives called Lioy a recluse who lived in a fantasy world.

In 2006, the California Supreme Court 
upheld Ramirez's convictions and death sentence. The U.S. Supreme Court 
refused in 2007 to review the convictions and sentence.

Two years later, San Francisco police 
said DNA linked Ramirez to the April 10, 1984, killing of 9-year-old Mei
Leung.

She was killed in the basement of a residential hotel in San 
Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood where she lived with her family.

Ramirez had been staying at nearby hotels.

Ramirez previously was tied to 
killings in Northern California. He was charged in the shooting deaths 
of Peter Pan, 66, and his wife, Barbara, in 1985 just before his arrest 
in Los Angeles, but he was never tried in that case.

Less than an hour later, Ramirez struck again in Monterey Park, 
attacking 30-year-old Tsai 'Veronica' Lian Yu. He pulled her out of her 
car onto the road and shot her several times, before fleeing. A police 
officer found her still breathing, but she later died at the hospital.

Mar. 27, 1985: Ramirez shot Vincent Zazzara, 64, and his wife Maxine, 44. Mrs Zazzara's body was mutilated with several stab wounds. She had a carving of the letter 'T' over her left breast and her eyes were gouged out. The mutilations were post-mortem, according to an autopsy.
