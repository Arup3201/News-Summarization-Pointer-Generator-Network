Hundreds of Tetris fans had a little fun Saturday with a big version of the classic video game.

The Philadelphia skyscraper-sized version created a spectacle against the night sky that organizers hoped inspired onlookers and players to think about the possibilities of technology.

The 29-story Cira Centre, which has hundreds of LED lights embedded in its glass facade, normally displays colorful geometric patterns at night. On Saturday, images of supersized shapes 'fell' on two sides of the mirrored tower as competitors used joysticks to maneuver them into place.

Building blocks: The classic video game Tetris is played on the 29-story Cira Centre in Philadelphia, Saturday April 5

It wasn't the first time Tetris has been played on a building. But the 100,000-square-foot 'screen' - which includes the north and south faces of the structure - could be a record.

City resident Sam Robinson, 30, said he signed up on a whim for the lottery to play because he figured 'it would be cool to play the world's largest game of Tetris.'

'It has been probably 15 years since I played Tetris last on a Game Boy, and it's much different playing on the side of building that's a half-mile away,' he said. 'Everything's happening so quick.'

The spectacle kicked off a citywide 
series of events called Philly Tech Week. It also celebrated the 
upcoming 30th anniversary of Tetris, a game revered as the epitome of 
elegance and simplicity, said Frank Lee, an associate professor of 
digital media at Drexel University.

Lee,
 a game designer who oversaw creation of the giant display, said putting
 it on an office building was like making a huge virtual campfire.

'This
 project began as a personal love letter to the games that I loved when I
 was a child - Pong last year, Tetris this year. But it ended up as a 
way of uniting the city of Philadelphia,' Lee told the crowd.

Game fans: Hundreds watched as competitors played the popular puzzle game

Lee
 already holds the Guinness World Record for the world's largest 
architectural video game display for playing Pong on one side of the 
Cira Centre last year. Pong, the granddaddy of all video games, is an 
electronic version of paddleball developed by Atari in 1972.

Tetris,
 created by Russian computer programmer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984, 
challenges players to rotate and arrange falling shapes into complete 
rows.

It became a global 
phenomenon in the late 1980s after game designer Henk Rogers, who had 
seen Tetris at a trade show in Las Vegas, acquired the rights and struck
 a deal to put it on Nintendo's original Game Boy.

Rogers,
 who was among the players on Saturday in Philadelphia, said he can't 
believe the longevity of Tetris, which decades later continues to 
mesmerize players on more than 30 platforms.

'If
 a game lasts a year, that's amazing,' said Rogers, now managing 
director of The Tetris Co. 'They usually go out of style very quickly.'

Rogers
 said several new Tetris products and initiatives are planned for 
release around its June 6 anniversary. He declined to discuss details.
