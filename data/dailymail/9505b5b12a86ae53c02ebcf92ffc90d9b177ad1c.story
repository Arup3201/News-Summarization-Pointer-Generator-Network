Former superintendent Roger Marshall arriving at the Hillsborough inquests in Warrington yesterday

A senior police officer has admitted 'profound regrets' for not delaying kick-off during the 1989 Hillsborough tragedy, but has maintained fans' drinking contributed to the disaster.

Former superintendent Roger Marshall told the inquests into the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans that when he realised the scale of the tragedy he went on 'auto-pilot because I linked the awful events on the terraces directly with my opening of the gates'. 

He also told the inquest into the events of the FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest that asking for the 3pm kick-off to be put back was an option open to him.

He told the jury of seven women and four men sitting in Warrington: 'I could certainly have requested a delay of kick-off.

'I can tell you that it was one of the most profound regrets of my experience at Leppings Lane on the 15th of April that I did not do so.'

He said he made four radio requests from 2.47pm onwards to the police control box for three exit gates at the Leppings Lane turnstiles of Sheffield Wednesday's ground to be opened amid his fears 'somebody would be killed if the gates weren't opened'.

Exit Gate C was then opened at 2.52pm on the orders of the match commander, chief superintendent David Duckenfield, with the jury previously hearing that an estimated 2,000 Liverpool fans came through and 'a significant number' headed for a central tunnel leading to the terraces of pens three and four behind the goal. 

Yesterday however, he maintained fans' drinking was partly to to blame.

During his patrols outside the stadium before heading to the Leppings Lane area from 2pm, he had noted a 'carnival atmosphere', but there was 'a tremendous amount of drinking going on here, there and everywhere'.

On foot in the crowds, he said he was aware that the build-up of the crowd grew progressively from 2.30pm and he said he asked the crowd to stop pushing from 2.35pm onwards.

Mr Marshall said it was people joining the back who were pushing.

At 2.40pm Mr Marshall climbed on to the parapet of the bridge over the River Don and said it was the first time he got 'a really good view' of the area.

Christina Lambert QC said: 'Was this the time you became really anxious?'

He said: 'The congestion. The fact that people were shoving and pushing. They did not need to do so but they did.'

The barrister asked him if he thought at that point the fans were going to get inside the stadium in time for kick-off.

He said: 'Surprisingly, no. They had no chance but at the time I thought possibly they could get in.'

By 2.46pm Mr Marshall described the scene as 'absolute bedlam'.

Mr Marshall said he did not accept he had mistaken his description of fans pushing and shoving for involuntary surges in the crowd.

He repeated that it was 'a battle which we could not possibly win'.

He said: 'We just did not have the numbers of police officers. Neither did we have the co-operation of fans at that stage at all.'

Mr Marshall said he thought 'some of the fans were determined to enter the stadium come what may' - not all, he said, but 'a substantial minority'.

He recalled a colleague outside the turnstiles urging him to open the exit gates but he was initially reluctant.

He explained: 'Here we have got a very, very substantial minority under the influence of drink, pushing and shoving without any sort of mutual respect for anybody else, without any self-discipline and really determined to get into the stadium.

'I thought that, well, if we open the gates this substantial minority is going to end up inside the stadium... causing a public order issue. Some of them may not have had tickets, I don't know. An indeterminate number would not have had tickets. Certainly a minority of them had far too much to drink.

'Close behind that was the absolute imperative of doing something about the situation outside because it was plain to me that unless I did something about it, people would be killed.'

The barrister asked if he considered upon reflection that he had made mistakes before he climbed up the parapet of the bridge.

Mr Marshall replied: 'Of course I made mistakes. I was in the present. I could not see into the future.

'I was doing my absolute utmost and very best to manage an increasingly deteriorating situation and as time progressed what options had I got left?'

He added: 'As time progressed I am sorry to say that the co-operation (of the fans) was not evident. Neither was self-discipline. Neither was self-control. Neither was a mutual respect for anybody else and these are the sorts of things we value in this country.'

Ms Lambert asked: 'Do you think you could have and should have done more?'

Mr Marshall replied: 'I think you can always say you could do more... I was in an unprecedented situation there. I was doing my absolute best. I was not standing around with my hands in my pockets.

'Disasters don't happen in my view because of one individual or a group of individuals have not done their best. Disasters happen because lots and lots of different factors all come together just at their own time and this is what we got, sadly.'

Referring to his comments about Liverpool supporters, Pete Weatherby QC, representing some of the bereaved families,  said to the witness: 'I am not going to suggest to you that all of the supporters acted as though they were on some kind of church outing but your references to the behaviour of Liverpool fans are simply offloading responsibility, aren't they?'

'No,' replied the witness.

The hearing continues today.
