The first step has been made in the inevitable disqualification of Saturday’s Badger Beer Chase winner The Young Master with the BHA lodging an objection to the result.

Arrangements are being made to hold a disciplinary hearing on Thursday when runner-up Court By Surprise is expected to be promoted.

The Young Master was an effortless winner of the £60,000 Wincanton race but it later emerged that he was not eligible to run.

A computer error allowed The Young Master to enter and win the Badger Beer Chase while being ineligible

Race conditions stated that a novice must have previously contested three chases and The Young Master had only run in two.

The BHA confirmed that their initial investigations have shown a ‘computer systems error’ was responsible for The Young Master’s entry being accepted.

But it also suggested the horse’s trainer, Neil Mulholland, may face some censure for his part in the episode.

The statement said: ‘It remains the trainer’s responsibility to ensure a horse is not declared for a race for which it is not qualified.’

The enquiry will also decide whether The Young Master should carry a penalty should he take up an entry at Cheltenham on Friday and whether his handicap mark should be adjusted even if he is stripped of the prize.

Trainer Neil Mulholland could face some sort of punishment following a disciplinary hearing

It has been a bad two weeks for British jumps racing. Race times suggest the distance of the Charlie Hall Chase run at Wetherby the previous weekend may have been shorter than advertised.

Officials were yesterday measuring the Yorkshire track, which races again on Saturday, and the results are expected on Tuesday.

The BHA will be praying the treble doesn’t come up with a disaster at the weekend’s big Cheltenham fixture.
