Radio and TV personality Paul Murray has described the sending of an offensive tweet about his tragic baby son as a 'dog act'.

Murray received the vile message from the Twitter account of a Labor Party member - who denied to Daily Mail Australia he was the person who sent it.

The tweet read: 'Paul, is it OK to say now your dead son Leo is a grub and deserved to die? Just thought I'd match your editorial tonight. Reply pls.' 

Andrew McMicking, from Brisbane, said he was hosting drinks at his home to remember the late Gough Whitlam on Tuesday night when friends took his phone and sent the message to Murray about his son Leo, who died just after birth due to complications in 2012. 

An angry Murray told Daily Mail Australia: ‘You can say whatever you want about me personally and it’s water off a duck’s back, I’m in the opinion business. 

‘But to unnecessarily involve my family, let alone attack the most precious part of my family, it’s a dog act.

‘If there’s a person out there thinks who thinks what was said is OK there is something wrong with them.’

Murray said he had received an apology from Mr McMicking but he was sceptical of his explanation.

‘I don’t doubt the sincerity that he is very sorry that it happened last night but if he was the person who authored the tweet he should resign from the Labor Party and get out of public life,’ he said.

‘He claims the person who stole phone is no longer his friend, then why not name them?

‘How can I prove he didn’t have people there and it’s not a sincere excuse? It’s impossible.' 

Mr McMicking insisted he was not responsible for the tweet or other 'aggressive' texts sent from his phone.

'I deleted it as soon as I discovered it had been sent,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I have put an explanation on my [Facebook] page and wrote to Paul Murray first thing this morning offering my apologies and explaining the matter.'

Mr McMicking did not respond to questions about who took his phone or why they sent the tweet. 

In the post on his Facebook page he wrote: 'Folks last night I had people over for drinks and to reminisce about Gough Whitlam.

Fellow media personality Dan Ginanne condemned Mr McMicking on Twitter

'A nice (and emotional) night for the most part, but then as the evening progressed some thought it funny to send out some (political/aggressive) texts and tweets in my name.

'These communications were completely inappropriate and not sanctioned by me at all. I sincerely apologise for any offence caused.

'After last night there are some individuals I no longer consider as friends.'

Mr McMicking launched an unsuccessful preselection bid in the Queensland seat of Ferny Grove earlier this year.

Mr Murray tweeted thanks to fellow media personalities Chris Kenny and Dan Ginanne, who condemned Mr McMicking on Twitter.

'@chriskkenny: Twitter is a sewer. @PMOnAir is a loving dad. Leo is a little ray of sunshine. Good night.' Love you mate. U too @DanGinnane,' Mr Murray wrote.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Murray for comment.
