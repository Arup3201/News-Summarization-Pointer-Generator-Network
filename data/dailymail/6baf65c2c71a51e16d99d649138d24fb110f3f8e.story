Crocodiles are known for being masters of disguise in the wild - and it seems this reptile has adapted perfectly to his new zoo enclosure, nearly fooling a passing photographer.

Song Kanokrattana, 44, was visiting her local zoo in Thailand with her niece, when the pair headed over to the crocodile enclosure in the hope of spotting one of the killer beasts.

Gazing across a seemingly-empty pond of algae, Song was about to leave in disappointment when she suddenly noticed one of the reptiles using the greenery for cover.

Song, a keen photographer who lives in Phuket, managed to take pictures of the creature after spotting its eyes poking up out of the water.
