Mumbai Airport Authority also confirmed the injuries, stating: 'There was a medical emergency at T2 yesterday in which our medical team attended to the injured cabin crew and passengers of Singapore Airlines.'

The plane was later given the all clear to fly again after being inspected by engineers.

The airline has been flying the A380 on the Singapore to Mumbai route since May this year.

In May 2013, 11 passengers were injured and photos revealed a chaotic cabin when a flight with the same carrier ran into turbulence on the way to London during food service. 

A passenger said the pilot gave a warning to expect turbulence before his coffee ended up on the ceiling of the plane, while food was all over the floor.
