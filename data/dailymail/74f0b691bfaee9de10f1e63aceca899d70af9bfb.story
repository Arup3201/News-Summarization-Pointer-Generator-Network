A Tennesee affiliate station has apologized for posting a link to explicit website Pornhub in a Tuesday tweet.

The tweet from WREG - which has since been removed - read 'Use our interactive radar to track the rain and storms,' with the Pornhub link immediately below.

The address for the link to the pornographic website included the username 'rockbone.'

Several Twitter users then used '#rockbone' in humorous tweets.

Whoops! WREG has apologized for featuring a Pornhub in a tweet about the weather 

Trending: One user captioned this meme 'You’re welcome. #rockbone.' The word appeared in a number of humorous tweets following WREG's mishap

'Is #RockBone going to be a villain in the next Spider-Man movie?' one user asked.

Another said 'Go easy, people. Let he among us who has not accidentally screwed up something with the internet at work cast the first #rockbone.'

One Twitter user joked 'There is a little shack near my work with always one or two guys on the porch. It's such an idyllic scene, like a Norman #Rockbone painting.'

'Everybody’s talkin’ ‘bout the sound, funny, but it’s still #rockbone to me,' a tweet said.

WREG  tweeted Tuesday at 5:43am, 'We apologize for a tweet that went out this morning.' 

Friendly gesture: Pornhub reached out to WREG on Twitter after the news station apologized for tweeting the explicit link

At 7:51am, the affiliate station tweeted 'Have you changed your passwords recently? Take it from us... Do it now. Also, resist public WiFi. For real...' and included a link to a story on how hackers can steal WiFi routers' passwords. 

Just one minute later, Pornhub tweeted 'Hey @3onyourside I hear you're a http://pornhub.com fan!'

'Since we have your attention today...Consider clicking this link and doing some good :)' WREG tweeted about twenty minutes later, along with a link to the WREG website.

The linked indicated how to make donations for St. Jude, House of Mews, UNCF, MDA, United Way and Streetdog Foudnation.

WREG said in a statement sent to MailOnline Thursday 'This morning an inappropriate tweet was sent out from the station's account. We apologize and have taken steps to investigate and to tighten security.'
