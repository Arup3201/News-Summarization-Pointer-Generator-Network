Miss Lebanon has today claimed that her rival Miss Israel had been chasing her for days before finally ambushing her in a Miss Universe selfie that sparked outrage in her own country.

The photograph which emerged earlier this week sent shockwaves through the home country of Lebanese beauty Saly Greige because the two countries are still officially at war. 

The selfie, taken in Miami at the Miss Universe pageant, led to Saly being accused of being unpatriotic - but now she is hitting back.

Plot: Saly's agent now claims it was part of a wider conspriacy to embarrass her dating back to November

Her agent claims that Saly had to 'run away' on a number of occasions because she was persistently chased by Israeli Doron Matalon - who was 'desperate' to capture the image.

Richard Pharaon claims it was part of a wider plot to embarrass the Lebanese beauty dating back to November in London, when a different Miss World representative for Israel also tried to hunt down a selfie with Miss Lebanon.

He said: 'It was 100 per cent deliberate. I can confirm that it was organised and planned since November 2014.

'Miss Israel was trying from the beginning to reach Saly and to have a selfie with her during the 20 days they stayed there.

'They were both sitting together once at the Marriott Hotel and Miss Israel came and asked Saly to have a selfie with her.

'Saly refused, of course, since she's perfectly aware of the conflict with Israel, and the whole situation in Lebanon.'

Mr Pharaon claims that Miss Greige, 25, was often forced to run away from Matalon, 21, due to her constant requests for a photograph together.

'Sad': Miss Israel Doron Matalon said in response: 'Too bad you can not put the hostility out of the game'

Threat: Saly faced calls for her to be stripped of her title after the selfie caused outrage in Lebanon

Pharaon added: 'After trying many times to take a selfie with Miss Lebanon, Miss Israel finally succeeded - without Miss Lebanon's approval, of course.

'Saly was running away from her all the time since she was being chased by her. She stands for her country no matter what.'

Saly has claimed that she was having a selfie with Miss Japan and Miss Slovenia when Miss Israel forced her way into the photograph and took the picture - catching them unawares.

Pharaon said: 'Miss Israel saw them, and she immediately joined them and took a selfie with them without leaving Miss Lebanon time to react, and she immediately posted the picture on her Instagram account.'

Israel and Lebanon are still technically at war but the last significant conflict between the countries was in 2006.

Saly reportedly received 3,000 aggressive and negative messages on Facebook, some of which accused her of being racist and criticised her for involving herself in politics.

Mr Pharaon said: 'Some people in Lebanon just want to invest in that story to ruin Miss Lebanon's reputation. They accused her of being non-patriotic, not caring and not loving her country.

'Most of the Lebanese people support Saly. They know that she would never intend to pose for a photo with Miss Israel.'

A PR representative for Doron refused to comment.

Complaint: Saly's agent has filed a complaint to pageant organisers but doesn't expect action to be taken 

Saly is from Al- Koura village in the north of Lebanon and has a Masters Degree in Civil Engineering. The 5'7' brunette speaks Arabic, English and French.

The Miss Universe website describes the 25-year-old as 'enthusiastic' and 'spontaneous'.

Her online bio reads: 'Despite the unstable situation in Lebanon, she is overwhelmed with the continuous hunger of Lebanese citizens for survival, resistance and most importantly success.'

Saly's team has made an official complaint to Miss Universe's management board,

Mr Pharaon said: 'Unfortunately, we are sure that it will lead nowhere, since it's a political matter, and we think that they will not interfere in such conflicts.'

Her agent also makes it clear there has been no interaction between the two contestants since the selfie was taken.

He said: 'They're not friends, they're not roommates, they don't like each other and there's no interaction between them.

'Saly always refused to talk to Miss Israel or be close to her, but Miss Israel was always trying to get hold of her on different occasions and all the time.'

But Miss Lebanon and her agent are refusing to let the negative backlash of the unfortunate photograph affect her campaign for the Miss Universe title and reject suggestions that she should withdraw from the competition.

Mr Pharaon said: 'Should someone pull out of the competition, it would be Miss Israel.

'Saly is now only focusing on the final prime. Her main purpose is to win. She's working hard and focusing only on the competition, Lebanon and herself.

Focus: Her agent told MailOnline: 'Should someone pull out of the competition, it would be Miss Israel... Her main purpose is to win. She's working hard and focusing only on the competition, Lebanon and herself'

'We consider what happened part of a big propaganda, Israel is the enemy, Saly is patriotic, and there's no doubt about that.'

On Sunday Miss Israel responded to Saly Greige's claims of being photobombed by saying that the Lebanese beauty's reaction to the photo made her 'sad'.

On her Facebook page, Doron wrote: 'It doesn't surprise me, but it still makes me sad.

'Too bad you can not put the hostility out of the game, only for three weeks of an experience of a lifetime that we can meet girls from around the world and also from the neighbouring country.'
