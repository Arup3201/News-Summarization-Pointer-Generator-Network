Tragic: Firefighter Dawn Brown has been found dead after her pet mastiff fatally bit her neck

A husband has returned home to find his firefighter wife killed by a dog they adopted from a family member just a week ago, police said.

Dawn Brown's husband discovered her body in their home in Big Rock, Illinois at 4.15pm on Monday, after she had suffered bites to the neck, Kane County Sheriff’s police Lt. Pat Gengler said.

Investigators determined the fatal wounds had been inflicted hours earlier that morning by a mastiff inside the home shared by the couple, who also have a boxer and a pit bull mix.

Dawn, 44, and her husband Bob had taken in the mastiff just a week ago from a family member who did not want it anymore, Gengler told MailOnline.

'It was an extremely muscular-looking dog with a large head,' Gengler said. 'It looked big, strong.'

He added that police continue to investigate what prompted the attack and whether the animal had previously shown any violent behaviour.

He maintained that the previous owners had not given the dog to the Browns because it had been aggressive, simply that they could not look after it anymore.

All three dogs were in the custody of Kane County animal control, he said. As of Wednesday evening, no decision had been made about whether or not to keep the mastiff alive, but Gengler added that it would likely be the victim's husband's decision.

The couple, who are childless, regarded their two older dogs as their children, Gengler said.

Brown's husband is also a volunteer firefighter with the Big Rock Fire Protection District and had attempted to resuscitate his wife on finding her body.

He called 911 and the Big Rock fire department responded to the call.

'Her friends and co-workers were the 
ones that were there,' Gengler said. 'It's a pretty emotionally 
devastating thing for them to go through.'

Cpt. Debra Raymond said to the Chicago Tribune: 'To pronounce one of your own dead is 
probably one of the hardest things we have to do.

'We live in a small town, so we know everyone. But when it's a member of your own team... we're like extended 
family.'

Of Brown and her husband, she added to the Sun Times: 'They were very much in love. Bob is devastated, and our thoughts are with him right now.'

The couple began training with the Big Rock Fire Protection District in 2003. She had also worked full time with the Bristol Kendall Fire Protection District in Yorkville since 2007.

Both Raymond and Bristol Kendall's Chief
Michael Hitzemann described Brown as a nurturing woman who was 
nicknamed 'Mother Dawn' by her co-workers.

'She was just a very kind, very caring person,' Hitzemann said. 'She mothered everybody, and tried to take care of everybody.'

Friend and colleague David Denison added on Facebook: 'A great, proud, smart, cheerful, fun , spirited, lover of life and friend lost her life in a tragic accident today.

'The Big Rock Fire Department will always remember you Dawn, RIP! Bob are [sic] thoughts and prayers are with you and your family. Anything you need please ask, we are ready and waiting to help in any way we can.'
