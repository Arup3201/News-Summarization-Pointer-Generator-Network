More than 400 red triangle-shaped pills - each embossed with the Superman 'S' logo - were tested after being found in Ipswich by Suffolk Police

A deadly batch of ecstasy pills that have been linked to the deaths of four men contained a dangerous chemical that is stronger than those normally found in the drug.

More than 400 red triangle-shaped pills - each embossed with the Superman 'S' logo - were tested after being found in Ipswich by Suffolk Police. 

They were found to contain PMMA, a chemical that can take several hours to work. Its slow release can prompt some users to take double the amount they would if taking MDMA-based ecstasy. 

Symptoms experienced by users include include initial shaking and sweating, which can develop into a rapid temperature increase, severely raised heart rate and blood pressure. 

When combined with alcohol or dehydration, these can prove fatal.

The drugs are believed to have led to the recent deaths of two young men in Ipswich, Suffolk, one in nearby Rendlesham and a fourth in Telford, Shropshire.

The first victim, 22-year-old Lithuanian factory worker Justas Ropas, who was also known as Justin, collapsed and died at his home in Ipswich on Christmas Eve.

Police are linking his death with that of Gediminas Kulokas, 24, also from Ipswich, who died on New Year's Day.

The death of Daniel Bagnall, 27, from Telford in Shropshire - the only one outside of Suffolk - is also believed to have been connected. 

Kulokas died less than three hours after another man, 20-year-old John Hocking, also a labourer, who died in nearby Rendlesham, near Woodbridge. 

Two men have also been admitted to hospital in Suffolk, possibly as a result of taking the drug.

A 19-year-old appeared in court on Monday, charged with supplying the deadly drugs.

Adrian Lubecki was remanded in custody at Magistrates' Court as his case was referred to Crown Court.

A 20-year-old man and a 26-year-old man from Ipswich were arrested on suspicion of supplying the drugs but have been released on bail while police continue their investigation.

Officers have offered amnesty to anyone prepared to hand in the tablets for testing in a desperate bid to get them off the streets. 

Today, Suffolk Police said it had tested the pills and found PMMA, a stronger and more dangerous active ingredient than those usually found in pure ecstasy.

Alan Murray, Suffolk County Council's cabinet member for health and adult care, said: 'These pills contain potentially lethal ingredients which as we have seen can have tragic consequences.

'We would urge people under no circumstances to take these or any other illegal drugs.

'This is a slow release drug taking several hours to work, and then lasting for several hours.

'Symptoms include initial shaking and sweating, which can develop into a rapid temperature increase, severely raised heart rate and blood pressure.

'When combined with alcohol or dehydration, this can prove fatal.'

'If you have taken illegal drugs, or if you know someone who has become unwell after taking illegal drugs and needs urgent medical care, call 999 immediately and ask for the ambulance service.'

Police are urging anyone in possession of the pills to hand them in to prevent further deaths or harm. Despite this appeal, so far no drugs have been handed into the force.

Superintendent Louisa Pepper said: 'Our absolute priority is to prevent anyone else from suffering the tragic consequences of these drugs, by removing them from our communities.

'We're urging anyone who has tablets matching this description not to take them or pass them on, and to hand them in to us or one of the agencies listed.

'We successfully seized a large quantity of drugs at the weekend but there may still be some out there, so if you are offered them or have any information about these tablets, please contact us immediately.'
