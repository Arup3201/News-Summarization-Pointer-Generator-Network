A woman who lost her arms as an infant in Kolkata when her 11-year-old mother attempted to end both of their lives by standing in front of an oncoming train in a murder-suicide attempt is now a happily married mother in Las Vegas.

The incredible journey of Shanthi Kimball began tragically in poverty but her sad course was reversed just a year later when a Mormon family from Montana adopted her and raised her as their own.

Now Kimball is raising two boys with her husband Conrad with the help of her unbelievably skilled feet, which she uses to do everything, from changing diapers to driving.

New beginnings: Shanthi Kimball with her husband, Conrad, has managed to overcome a tough start in life after losing both arms when her 11-year-old mother tried to end both their lives

Hope: Shanthi had to have both arms amputated, but an American family later adopted her from an Indian orphanage

'It actually hasn’t been that hard because it’s normal for me,' Kimball said told Deseret News.

Her life has taken her from the streets of some of the world's most depressed slums to a joyful religious life in a gleaming American city.

It all began when she was found beside some train tracks at two months old.

Her arms had been severed from her body. Nearby were the remains of her 11-year-old mother.

Baby Shanthi was taken to an orphanage, where she would wait 11 months before finally being adopted by a Mormon couple, though even for the deeply faithful Montana couple it wasn't an easy decision.

Her mother Karen first saw her in a pamphlet that showed pictures of some of India's homeless or abandoned children.

'I quickly told her that she didn't know what she was talking about, I meant the hardship of raising a child with a handicap such as that. Karen quickly said, that doesn't matter and she was meant to be our daughter, but I quickly said no again, Shanthi's adoptive father Bruce wrote in his journal.

However, he soon found himself having a change of heart after reading a passage of scripture in the Bible's book of Matthew.

'When I read that passage it struck me with much force that Shanthi was the child ordained in heaven to be our daughter, and that I was denying her, and I would be held accountable if I denied her any longer,' Bruce wrote.

Shanthi arrived in the United States when she was 13 months old and began her new life.

'I always felt part of the family,' said Shanthi, who would eventually have a total of eight siblings, six of whom were adopted.

Her journey toward adulthood would be paved with one amazing accomplishment after the next.

She learned to draw and paint with her feet, according to LDSmag.com, and even went on to receive an art degree from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.

She met her husband and the father of her two sons, Conrad, at the LDS singles ward she was attending while a student at UNLV.

And the rest is heartwarming history thanks to adoption, prayer, and the inspiration of the Holy Ghost.

'I am just grateful for the opportunity to be a mother, and I don’t harbor any resentment for what my [birth] mother did,' said Shanthi. 'She was just a child herself. I don’t know what the circumstances were, but I’m sure in the next life I will receive all the answers to the questions I have.'
