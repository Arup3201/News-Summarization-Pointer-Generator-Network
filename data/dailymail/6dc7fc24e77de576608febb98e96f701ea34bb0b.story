Jamie Carragher would not select club captain Steven Gerrard for Liverpool's top-four showdown with Manchester United at Anfield next Sunday.

While Gary Neville says Angel di Maria, available again after serving a one-match suspension, should return to Louis van Gaal's side in favour in Juan Mata despite United's convincing win against Tottenham at the weekend.

Gerrard made his first appearance for Brendan Rodgers' side since early February when he came on as a second-half substitute against Swansea on Monday.

'No I wouldn't,' Carragher said on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football show. 'The team is playing well. They're on a great run since Steven's been out the team. 

'Unfortunately, and he'll know himself, when you go out the team and they continue on a great run it's hard to get back in. 

'It's unfortunate for him but we've all been there towards the end of our careers. There are players playing too well that you can't leave them out.'

Carragher says that Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen cannot be dropped from the team

Carragher would also play Raheem Sterling up front, like he did during the win against Manchester City

Carragher also thinks Rodgers should sacrifice Daniel Sturridge and move Raheem Sterling up front, adopting a similar style to in the Manchester City game, which Liverpool won 2-1 earlier this month.

'The problem you have with Daniel Sturridge is, he is your best striker and you want him in your team, but he's not quite right yet. He's not quite 100 per cent. 

'He's not actually producing and these games are becoming vital. But you need to play him to get back to his level.

Neville would drop Juan Mata for Di Maria because the Argentine's pace could be key against Liverpool

Former United defender Neville would make Di Maria for Mata the only change to the side that beat Tottenham

'But I go back to that Man City game and that may come into Brendan Rodgers' thinking. That was Liverpool at their best, that high intensity and that pressing. That's what you get from Sterling at the front that maybe you lack with Sturridge.'

Meanwhile, former United defender Neville believes Angel di Maria's pace could prove vital against Liverpool and says he would bring the Argentine in to replace Juan Mata.

'I think nine of them are absolute certainties, rest-aside injuries that could happen in training,' Neville said. 'I think Valencia, Smalling, Jones, Fellaini, Carrick, Herrera, Young and Rooney will all play. 

'The big decision is Di Maria or Mata. I would go with Di Maria for pace. I think they will need to play on the counter attack and also match the speed of Moreno and Coutinho (on the Liverpool left).'
