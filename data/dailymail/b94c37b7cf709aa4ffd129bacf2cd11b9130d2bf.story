A French corporal who served with British soldiers in Afghanistan and admitted to eating the tongue and heart of a 90-year-old man had post-traumatic stress disorder, it has been claimed.

Jérémy Rimbaud, 26, is said to have admitted breaking into the home of Lépold Pédébidau and using an iron rod to beat him over the head before cutting out parts of his body with a penknife.

Cooked meat found on a plate with white beans was confirmed by forensic experts to be human, following the incident in Nouilhan, south-west France, on November 15 in the hamlet of 200 people.

The attack has drawn comparisons to Hannibal Lecter in the 1991 film Silence Of The Lambs. The character, played by Anthony Hopkins, ate human organs ‘with some fava beans and a nice Chianti’.

The son of Mr Pédébidau was alerted to what had happened by the flames coming from his father’s house nearby - which was set alight by Rimbaud following the attack, according to investigators.

Rimbaud - who had been serving abroad in a tank regiment with British and US soldiers - is accused of attacking another man in France by hitting him against a tractor, reported The Daily Telegraph.

The soldier allegedly told police he was 'acting on messages in his head' - and is set to face trial next year over charges of murder, violating the integrity of a corpse and attempted murder.

Rimbaud was said by a regimental source to have ‘posed no problems during his stint’ in Afghanistan from 2010 to 2011 - but has now been moved to a high-security unit for dangerous psychopaths.

He left the army just nine days before allegedly committing the attack - and France Bleu Béarn cited a prosecutor as confirming that military doctors had diagnosed him as suffering from PTSD.

PTSD is a reaction to a traumatic event where people can see they are in danger, or where they see other people dying or being injured in circumstances out of their control.

Many victims of serious accidents, military combat, terrorist attacks, disasters and life-threatening illnesses have been diagnosed with suffering from the condition.
