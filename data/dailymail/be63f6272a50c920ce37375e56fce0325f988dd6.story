Teenager Nile Wilson narrowly missed out on a medal in the men's horizontal bar on the final day of the World Gymnastics Championships in China.

The 18-year-old, forced to withdraw from Friday's all-around finals with a wrist injury, took fourth place on Sunday with a score of 14.766, with Croatia's Marijo Moznik beating him to bronze with a score of 15.000.

The Dutch Olympic champion Epke Zonderland claimed gold with a total score of 16.225.

But Leeds-born Wilson, who took gold in this event among four medals at the Commonwealth Games, was delighted with fourth after the disappointment of Friday.

'I didn't really go in with any expectations,' he said. 'I was just happy to be in the final and to be lined up against an Olympic champion was unreal. Coming fourth is a great achievement, just below the medals. Eighteen years old. I could not be happier.

'I know my difficulty is quite low so I just focused on going really clean today. Just tried to enjoy myself. That was the main thing.'

The experience also gave Wilson a better idea of what he needs to do to one day match the likes of Zonderland.

'First, I'm going to increase my difficulty,' he said. 'I think he's gone up to seven plus (difficulty), so that's my first target. And during the skills he's doing, he's just unbelievable. My target and my mission is to beat him. One day, I think I can do it.'

Wilson was forced to retire from the all-round event after injuring his wrist

Wilson withdrew from Friday's final, handing his place to Max Whitlock who went on to take silver.

'I made the decision the day before (the final),' he said. 'My wrist injury was getting to the point where it was a bit silly to carry on and it could cause a major injury. So I made that decision to help Max get through.

'I think it was the right decision. It could have done serious damage to my wrist and that would have put me out for months. I didn't want that. I was thinking more about the future. It's my first world championships, not the be all, end all of my career.'
