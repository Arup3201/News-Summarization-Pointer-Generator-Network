Former newspaper editor and Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson faced court for the first time on phone-hacking charges yesterday.

He and five other figures formally working for the News of the World appeared at Westminster Magistrates’ Court accused of plotting to hack the voicemails of up to 600 people.

Coulson, 44, who became David Cameron’s press chief after quitting the tabloid in 2007 following the jailing of the paper’s royal editor on phone hacking charges, sat in silence surrounded by his former lieutenants.

editor Stuart Kuttner, 72, head of news Ian Edmondson, 43, news editor 
Greg Miskiw, 62, chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, 50, reporter James 
Weatherup, 56, and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, 41.

Together, 
the seven face a total of 50 charges relating to Scotland Yard’s phone 
hacking investigation which led to the closure of the tabloid last year.

They are accused of conspiring to 
intercept phone messages left for celebrities, politicians and victims 
of crime, with Coulson and four others charged with plotting to hack voicemails left for murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler 
following her disappearance in 2002.

Case: The seven men had to sit and listen for 15 minutes as the court clerk read out all the charges brought against them by the CPS

to read the charges involving alleged victims such as Brad Pitt, 
Angelina Jolie, Sir Paul McCartney, Wayne Rooney, David Blunkett, 
Sven-Goran Eriksson, Abi Titmuss, John Leslie, Delia Smith, Jude Law, 
Sadie Frost, Sienna Miller, Lord Prescott and Lord Frederick Windsor.
