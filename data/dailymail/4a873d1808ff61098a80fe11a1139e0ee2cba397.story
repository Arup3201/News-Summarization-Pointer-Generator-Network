Former X-Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos has today been found guilty of assaulting a blogger at V-Festival after a string of court appearances over the past few weeks.

The N-Dubz star hit blogger Savvas Morgan during an altercation at the V Festival in Essex last year. 

Throughout her days in court Tulisa Contostavlos underwent somewhat of a style overhaul, smartening up her look with an array of sharp trouser suits, high collared silk blouses and formal frocks - often very different from her usual look.

Tulisa hears court ruling on assalt charges at Stratford Magistrates today. She styled her hair in a tidy low ring bun and wore a navy trouser suit with a white lace blouse, finishing her look with nude pointed heels

Previously the singer was often seen in revealing 
bandage dresses and shorts skirts but 
she meant business as she stood up in court in super-smart attire.

She ditched her usual style of cleavage-baring outfits and chunky gold jewellery in favour of a demure, no-nonsense image.

Today marks the end of Tulisa's sensational court appearances which began at the end of last year as she is found guilty of assaulting the blogger at V-Festival. On Monday, she was cleared of arranging a drugs deal.

The star took took her time at court very seriously, attending every single hearing regardless of whether she was required to or not.

She experimented with hair colour, heel height and hem length, but was always immaculately turned out with glamorous hair and makeup.

Her
 look changed from long blonde curls and tight skinny jeans which she 
sported back in December, to today's super-smart combination of slick ring 
buns, pointed courts, silk blouses and sharp trouser suits.

One of her
 strongest looks was seen on June 27 when she appeared in court to 
answer to charges stemming from an alleged drug deal.

Wearing a 
steely gaze on her heavily made-up face, Tulisa marched into court in a 
perfectly tailored pistachio green trouser suit, which she teamed with 
nude stilettos  and a button-down blouse featuring a chain-link 
print design.

But last Tuesday the star relaxed her image as she wore her hair in a long side ponytail and dressed in a floaty short dress.

The
 £150 Ted Baker Eponi style featured watercolour tree print, contrast 
trim and belt, three quarter sleeves and button fastening.
