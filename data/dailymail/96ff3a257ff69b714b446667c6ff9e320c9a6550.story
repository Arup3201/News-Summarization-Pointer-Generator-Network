The father of a suspected teenage jihadist has reportedly staged a daring mission to rescue his son from the clutches of Islamic State fighters in Syria.

After learning that 19-year-old Ahmed Mohammadi had left his home in Cardiff, Wales, allegedly to join ISIS fighters, his father Karim journeyed 2,000 miles to bring him back to Britain.

He is believed to be the first British father to have successfully rescued his child from the forces of the Islamic State.

Ahmed was friends with Nasser Muthana, 20, and Reyaad Khan, 21, two jihadists from Cardiff who appeared in an IS recruiting video in June, urging other young Britons to join the fighting. 

It is not known if Ahmed had travelled to Syria with Muthana and Khan, but it is thought he had spent time with Muthana before leaving for the war-torn country, where Islamist groups are fighting President Bashar Assad's forces. 

Mr Mohammadi, who is of Kurdish-Iraqi descent, has insisted that his son had visited Syria as part of a humanitarian mission to help refugees,  had nothing to do with terrorism and had not joined in with fighting.

However, he reportedly decided to travel to Syria himself after becoming fearful that the teenager was falling under the influence of other UK jihadists. 

Mr Mohammadi is thought to have been supported in his mission by acquaintances in Cardiff, who put him in touch with contacts in Turkey.

Once there, he was helped across the border into Syria by guides from the Kurdish community and was eventually able to track down his son, and convinced him to return home.

'There is a great sense of honour and family value in what Mr Mohammadi did,' a police intelligence source told The Sunday Times.

The source also said that more parents were expected to make similar journeys to bring their own children home. 

On his return to the UK in July, Ahmed was arrested under the Terrorism Act, but was released without charge.

He was instead referred to the government's counter-radicalisation scheme, known as the Channel programme, which has been offered to many of the 300 young Britons who have arrived back from Syria and Iraq.

His father has said Ahmed has now  returned to university to study civil engineering.

The scheme has seen a 58 per cent rise (from 748 to 1,281) in the number of referrals in the past year as the crisis in the Middle East grew. 

Evidence of the softer approach comes despite assurances from Home Secretary Theresa May that terrorist sympathisers will face the full force of the law.

She said new legislation should be ready by the end of this month as David Cameron insisted returning jihadis should face ‘criminal investigations and prosecution’.

But Whitehall sources say securing evidence of terrorist activities committed 2,000 miles away in Syria is proving difficult. 

An assessment of Ahmed and another suspected jihadist Shahid Miah, 23, by the Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit in August found that the pair were susceptible to ‘indoctrination’.

Miah was also referred to Channel.

The Government raised the national security threat level in August to ‘severe’ amid warnings of the threat posed by returning jihadists.

At least 500 young British Muslims are thought to have travelled to fight in Iraq and Syria, of which around 300 are thought to have returned to the UK. 

It is claimed that at least 24 British jihadists have been killed fighting with Islamic State and other terror groups in the region.

Some disenchanted travellers have asked for an amnesty after discovering the dangerous reality of infighting among Islamist groups on the frontline.

Police chiefs have insisted that every case of a returning jihadi will be treated ‘on its merits’ with some offered support by mental health experts or social services.

They are closely monitoring the progress of a Danish programme for rehabilitating jihadis which offers a wealth of support and counselling.
