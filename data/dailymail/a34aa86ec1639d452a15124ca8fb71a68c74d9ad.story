The 16-year-old boy who admitted to Wisconsin police that he was the one to shoot his young neighbor with an arrow is now due to be tried as an adult.

The local circuit court ruled Wednesday that the boy, who has not been named because he is a minor, will face the pending criminal charges as if he were two years older.

The unidentified boy and a 17-year-old who was a witness to the scene, confessed during a second interview with police.

Victim: Aryanna Schneeberg, 8, was shot in the back with an arrow when she was playing in her backyard

Life-saving: The young girl had to undergo a two-and-a-half-hour surgery to treat her injuries

'They basically said that they shot an arrow at a squirrel and the arrow impacted the child and at that point they heard the child scream and obviously at that point they were afraid,' Sheriff Mylan Fink said at a press conference.

'You hear a scream and normally, your normal human reaction is to go towards that to see if you can help, not turn on your heels and run away,' Aryanna's grandmother told Fox6.

The teen is currently in juvenile custody as the news about the adult sentencing coming today via the New York Daily News.

The victim in the unusual crime was Aryanna Schneeberg, an eight-year-old girl who had to undergoe life-saving surgery after the arrow penetrated her lung, spleen, stomach and liver.

Aryanna's mother said she was too angry to speak with reporters but the girl's grandmother said she hopes for an apology.

Damage: The arrow went through her left lung, spleen and stomach with the tip coming to a stop in the liver

'For me I'd like him to come face-to-face to Arie and say sorry,' she said.

Recalling the horrific event at a news conference on May 22, before the two teens had come forward, Aryanna's mother Laura Schneeberg said, 'I screamed.'

'I [saw] it, she was on the sidewalk right in front of our house,' she said.

During the police investigation, a bow and several arrows were confiscated from a nearby residence. Those items were sent to a crime lab for analysis.

‘We're leaving all of the evidence open on what could have happened,’ Fink said at the time of their investigation. ‘The working theory is a stray arrow, but that could change in a minute.'

Her mother and her mother’s boyfriend both concurred that it was surely an accident but still wanted the person responsible to come forward so that police can talk with them.

Arrest: A 16-year-old boy has been arrested after admitting to have mistakenly shot 8-year-old Aryanna Schneeberg one week ago with an arrow, nearly killing her

Lucky: Arynanna, seen this week after 2-1/2 hours of surgery, is lucky to be alive doctors said

'Obviously it was an accident.  Somebody wasn’t pin-pointing her, but in town, it’s wrong to be shooting a bow,' Ms Schneeberg told Fox6.

Ms Schneeberg's boyfriend echoed the sentiment, saying that they wanted to make sure it doesn’t threaten their daughter’s outdoor playtime.

'There’s kids out in the yard all the time. It’s kinda scary. There were four girls together and the arrow hit one of them. It could have hit any of them,' Andy Raasch said.

The girl was transported to a local hospital and then taken to Milwaukee Children's Hospital in a Flight For Life helicopter.

'It's very, very rare to have an arrow injury. I've never seen it before,’ said her doctor John Densmore, during a news conference shortly after the incident.

Angry: The girl's mother, Laura Schneeberg, seen at a press conference last week, was too angry to comment following the teen's arrest

Scene: Aryanna and three of her friends were playing in this yard when she was struck in the back by the arrow

The girl is ‘very lucky to be alive,’ he said.

‘Had we changed the trajectory by as little as two centimeters, this could have been a very bad outcome.’

Aryanna is also lucky that she had wise parents at the scene, as her mother chose not to remove the arrow before seeing a doctor because she was unsure how deep it went into her daughter’s body.

Doctors say that was the smart choice, because she could have done more damage by removing the arrow and accidentally tearing some of the girl’s internal organs on the way out.

Aryanna is was walking and talking shortly after the incident, but doctors initially was expected to be in the hospital for one to two weeks because she still has an NG tube draining her stomach and a drain running from her lung.
