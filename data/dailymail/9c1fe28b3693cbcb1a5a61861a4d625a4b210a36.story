Femail spoke to psychologist Linda Papadopoulos author of ‘Whose Life If It Anyway’ who said that Taylor’s appeal lies in the fact that she speaks honestly to her fans.

'Taylor talks about the stuff that matters to young girls. She talks about heartbreak, about people being mean to you, about not fitting in, about being worried about your looks.

‘It really resonates with the people who listen to her music. And with someone like Taylor they really believe that they could be her friend.’

Taylor's album 1989 is the fastest selling album in the last 12 years.

Taylor is well known for being open and honest about her personal life. In fact, she will readily admit that most of her musical material is  about her own experiences whether they be with men or with friends.

She recently revealed that 1989 is about a lot of her past relationships and growing up.

Taylor said, ‘On this album, I'm writing about more complex relationships, where the blame is kind of split 50-50.

‘I'm writing about looking back on a relationship and feeling a sense of pride even though it didn't work out.

‘[And] reminiscing on something that ended but you still feel good about it, falling in love with a city, falling in love with a feeling rather than a person.’

Linda went on to say, ‘Taylor is always consistent with her message. 

We all expect with celebrities that there is going to be a big difference between what they say and what they do but with Taylor that doesn’t happen.

 'She seems to behave very much in the same way whether it be in her private life or her personal life so her fans know where they stand with her.’

Linda explains that much of Taylor’s appeal comes from the fact that she offers a change from over-sexualised stars such as Rihanna, Rita Ora and Nicki Minaj.

Stars who are as well known for dancing around in risque outfits as they are for their music. 

According to our experts Taylor is so popular because she provides an antidote to performers like Rihanna (left) and Nicki Minaj (right) who some view as over-sexualised

‘I speak to a lot of young girls who don’t feel like they want to be that sexual and Taylor provides that alternative. 

‘She bridges the gap. She says you can be sexy sometimes but you can also geek out and just have fun with your friends.’

Plus she works hard, ‘It also helps that she writes her own music. Young people are becoming incredibly savvy to the way in which in the music industry works and the smoke and mirrors but she has that authenticity.

‘You know you see some people telling young women to "do this" and "do that" but Taylor is just sharing her experiences. She’s very honest and open about that and that’s a lot of her appeal.’

Taylor Swift was born on December 13th 1989 and was raised in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania. However it wasn't until she was 14 when she moved to Nashville that she began crafting her career starting out as a country singer.

In 2005 she was signed to independent label Big Machine Records and started working on her first album, Taylor Swift. Even at a young age Taylor was a strong song-writer, penning three of the tracks for her first release on her own.

After touring extensively Taylor began to gain huge popularity across the US. In fact, by 2008 she had been nominated for the Best New Artist award at the Grammies - she lost out to Amy Winehouse.

It was in the same year that she began working on her second studio album, Fearless. She wrote seven tracks on the album and became the first ever country artist to win an MTV Video Music Award.

Come 2009 and people were not only beginning to pay attention to Taylor's music but her love life also. Following her break up from Joe Jonas in 2008 she dated Taylor Lautner and John Mayer in 2009, famously going on to write the track 'Dear John' about him.

In 2010 she released her third album, Speak Now. Not only was it the first time she had written the whole album herself, it also marked her move into a more poppy sound.  She won the American Music Awards 'Artist of the Year' award in 2011.

During 2011 and 2012 she toured extensively on a 111 date world-tour inviting acts such as Justin Bieber, Nicki Minaj and Selena Gomez to join her for special one off performances. 

Completing her transition into global superstar in 2012 Taylor released Red working with her friend Ed Sheeran and Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody on tracks such as 'Everything has changed' and 'The Last Time.'

Before the release of her current album 1989, Red was her best selling album. She shifted a huge 1.208million copies.  

Martine Parnell, Director of Marketing at ticket marketplace Seatwave says that on an industry level Taylor's popularity stems from the fact that she appeals to a wide audience.

‘Taylor Swift's popularity boils down to her remarkably broad appeal. She has the ability to write the ultimate pop song that transcends era, fashion and genre.

‘It catches the ear of everyone no matter whether they believed themselves Taylor Swift fans before and she delivers a live performance second to none.

‘Where her contemporaries like Miley Cyrus and Iggy Azalea play to the sound of moment, Taylor is poised to become the female icon of her generation and her fans can’t wait for her  tour next year.’

Taylor recently announced her plans for a 1989 world tour. So far she has announced 57 dates across North America and Europe.
