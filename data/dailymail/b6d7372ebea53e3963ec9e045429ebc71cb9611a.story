Just when you thought you were safe - the Polar Vortex is back.

The Midwest and North East are thawing out after being covered with more than a foot of snow over the past week, but forecasters have warned it won't be for long as another cold front is on its way.

The wintry storm is expected to slam the Midwest this weekend, bringing ferocious winds and freezing temperatures as low as 35 degrees below normal.

After rattling the Midwest, it will stretch into the South and East at the start of next week, according to Weather Underground.

A six-to-ten-day forecast from NOAA also reveals a terrifying swathe of cold temperatures starting in the Midwest on Tuesday and stretching south and to the coast - where the mercury is expected to plummet to temperatures below average, while a higher than average amount of rain is also due.

'Temperatures 20°F below normal will likely invade the Upper 
Midwest on Sunday, and gradually spread southeastwards during the week,' Dr Jeff Masters of the Weather Underground said.

'The peak cold is predicted to occur late next week, with temperatures 20
 - 35° below normal covering much of the eastern 2/3 of the country.'

Ten-day forecasts by Weather.com show that temperatures will stay below freezing, with Embarrass, Minnesota enduring lows of -29F next Friday.

And it won't be over quickly as forecaster predict that the best chance of snow is believed to be between February 26 and March 3, as temperatures on the East Coast remain at least 15 degrees below normal, Philly.com reported.

Masters added that due to these predicted temperatures, the cost of natural gas is soaring.

The latest polar vortex follows a major thaw across the Midwest, where temperatures remained above freezing in Chicago, Minneapolis and Detroit for the second day.

But Dr Masters warned that with these warmer climes - with temperatures reaching the low 50s - come new problems of dangerous flash flooding.

'Much of Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, 
Minnesota, and Indiana are covered by snows of 10 to 30 inches that if melted, 
would be equivalent to 2 to 6 inches of rain,' he said.

In New York City, there are other warnings - as sheets of ice are falling from buildings as temperatures begin to rise, posing risks for pedestrians below.

It will come as yet more grief for the Midwest, southern and eastern areas of the country, which has been battered with grueling weather while the West largely suffers from droughts.

The relentless snow and ice storms this season have been connected to scores of traffic-related deaths and have led to the highest number of flight cancellations in more than 25 years.

U.S. airlines have canceled more than 75,000 domestic flights since December 1, including roughly 14,000 last week - the highest total number and highest percent of cancellations since at least the winter of 1987-1988, when records began.
