A horrific video shows a Chinese female student engulfed in flames after a waitress tips too much flammable fluid on her table in a cook-your-own barbecue restaurant. 

The shocking video was filmed on the restaurant's CCTV on September 3.

A woman with the surname, Qian, 20, who lives in  Heyang, a county of Weinan, Shaanxi in northwest China, apparently went to the self-service BBQ restaurant to meet a college friend before they returned to college after the summer break.

The video posted, on chinasmack.com, shows the two friends eating their barbecued food at their table.

A horrific video shows a Chinese female student rolling around hysterically as she is engulfed in flames in a BBQ restaurant, after a waitress tipped lighter fluid on a hot plate

A waitress is then called to the two friend's table when because there is not enough heat to cook the food.

The 18-year-old waitress, named Shan, had only been working at the self-service barbecue restaurant for a month.

She said her boss had previously only allowed her to refile the barbecues with a more experienced employee present. But the other employee had the day off and it was her first shot at refilling the BBQ plates by herself.

The flame ignited because the waitress had poured the fluid on a BBQ in which a flame was still burning. This caused the entire table to ignite.

To make matters worse, the panicked waitress apparently threw the entire bottle of alcohol on the table as she ran from the scene, leaving the 20-year-old student engulfed in flames.

For over 10 seconds, Young Qian  rolled around on the floor, hysterically kicking and screaming, as she attempted to put out the burning flames. Her friend finally ran over shirtless, smacking the flames with his white shirt.

It was when Young Qing felt that the heat from the barbeque was not strong enough, that he called the waitress over to their BBQ table and asked for the flames to be stronger

The young woman was rushed to hospital, where she was treated for burns.

Fortunately for waitress Young Shan and Young Qing, their burns were not as severe as Young Qian, who was immediately transferred to the better equipped Yiwu Central Hospital for severe burns and then transferred a second time to a hospital in Hangzhou.

Young Shan's right hand was only lightly burnt and Young Qing,  suffered second-degree burns on his head and neck and was transferred to an ordinary ward after being bandaged.

The waitress who is completely horrified by her mistake, has been asking doctors if she will go to jail. 

'I never thought this kind of thing would happen,' she said. 

Yiwu police are investigating the incident.  

The barbecue still had a flicker of a flame, as Young Shan poured the alcohol into the grill, which immediately ignited dangerous flames that shot across to Young Qian, causing her whole body to be captured in flames

The panicked waitress threw the bottle of alcohol and bolted across the room

Young Qing left the 20-year-old student engulfed in flames

Young Qian rolled around on the floor, hysterically kicking and screaming, as she attempted to put out the burning flames
