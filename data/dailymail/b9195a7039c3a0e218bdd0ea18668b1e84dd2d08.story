If only summer’s end wasn’t quite so sudden – or sodden.

Yesterday Britain was baking in a 30C (86F) heatwave; today many woke up to a blanket of drizzle and temperatures 14C lower.

And forecasters warn the autumnal rains will only get heavier this afternoon, bringing with them a risk of floods

Hot September: People make the most of the last summer weather on Brighton seafront and pier in East Sussex, cooling off and topping up their tans

It is a far cry from yesterday 
afternoon, when  parts of the country were treated to the hottest 
September temperatures for 50 years.

The
mercury peaked at 30.2C (86F) in Kent, just 0.3 degrees behind the 
seven-year September high of 30.5C (86.9F) recorded in 2006. Wattisham 
in Suffolk recorded its hottest September day for 52 years, reaching 
29.4C (84.9F).

But 
weather fronts sweeping in from the Atlantic today are set to bring with
them steadily heavier rains. Meanwhile, the mercury will fall to 16C 
(61F) in the South – and lower in the North.

Forecasters
said nearly three inches (72mm) of rain is expected to fall by Sunday 
afternoon on ground baked hard by the hot summer, meaning heavy rainfall
is likely to flow straight off rather than soaking down to the water 
table.

Flood warnings 
have been issued for parts of the East Midlands, the North West and 
Yorkshire and Humber. Billy Payne, forecaster at MeteoGroup, said:

‘There will be quite a lot of rainfall over the next few days, it will linger into Saturday and Sunday, certainly in the West.’

He said temperatures could fall as low as 5C (41F) tonight.

Fun day: Megan Phillips, four, plays on the beach in West Wittering, West Sussex as Britain basks in one last day of summer before rain is set to hit tomorrow

Balancing act: Glenn Bevons on his segway in a corn maze at Farmer Copley's. Segway tours are being run for a limited time at the 10-acre field in Purston near Featherstone

Lovely day: Clare Robinson, 22, relaxes on a punt on the River Avon near Bath Boating Station in Somerset, as the hot weather continues into September

Relaxing: Sunseekers - pictured here in Brighton - were warned to wrap up from tomorrow, when unsettled weather will make it feel like the curtain has fallen on summer

The rest of England and Wales was 23C 
to 25C today, although parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland had to 
settle for a cool but dry day.

But
sunseekers were warned to wrap up from tomorrow, when a band of 
unsettled weather will make it feel like the curtain has fallen on 
summer.

MeteoGroup
forecaster Sean Penston said: ‘We've had a good, dry and warm start to 
September, with temperatures in the mid-to-late 20s.

‘But
the weather will get more unsettled going into the weekend. There will 
be some fairly heavy and prolonged periods of rain - a complete change.’

Heavy
downpours in north east Wales and north west England are forecast, 
where up to 35mm of rainfall in 24 hours is expected from 6am tomorrow.

News
of a change in weather comes as thousands of music lovers arrive on the
Isle of Wight for the start of the Bestival music festival.

Mr Penston said: ‘There will be showers tomorrow at the festival, with some sunny spells and further showers on Saturday.

‘It
will likely be dry on Sunday, but it is definitely worth packing the 
wellies. Things are going to start getting a bit more autumnal from this
weekend.’
