A number of witnesses have come forward to say that Dallas Cowboys player Jerry Brown was alive and screaming for help after teammate Josh Brent - who was allegedly drunk - crashed the car they were traveling in.

Stacee McWilliams, 40, from Irving, told police on Monday that when she stopped at the scene of the  accident, she practically had to beg Brent to help his best friend out of the Mercedes, which was upside down and on fire.

She said: 'I jumped out and ran out toward the wreck. I yelled to Brent, "Are you OK? Are you OK?" And he told me he was fine as he was pacing back and forth.

'I was 
relieved because I thought, it’s just a single-car accident, nobody’s 
hurt. And then fire sparked up from the car and got bigger and I started
to hear screams.

'The fire became very hot, very bright, very big and then I started to hear screams coming from inside the vehicle and it was a man's voice saying "Help me, Help, somebody help me". Jerry was alive, he was hurt, calling out and his own friend walked away.

'(Brent) looked at me and said, "He 
won't get out of the car", and I said to him, "Get him out of the car, 
you have to save him".'

She told the Dallas Morning News she 
then went back to her car to call 911 and when she returned, Brown was 
lying in the middle of the road and his teammate was walking away from him.

'He abandoned him', she said. 'I want people to understand that Josh Brent is not a hero.

'I keep hearing reports of how he was there to pull his friend from the fire, but he had to be coerced and pushed and begged and pleaded to get his friend out of the fire.

'And when he pulled him out, he just left him in the street. He didn't tell him "Hang in there, help is on the way". Nothing. He just left him there and I want the magnitude of that to be understood.'

Brent’s attorney, George Milner, called McWilliams’ account 'absolutely false'.

'What I’ve been told is that Jerry 
Brown was never conscious after the accident,' Milner said. 'This woman,
while present in the area of the accident, could not have seen or heard
anything she said about Josh.

'It is believed Mr Brown was already deceased and could not have possibly uttered the calls for help claimed by Ms McWilliams.

'He's a giant, kind-hearted teddy bear with a heart as big as his body.'

A second woman came forward yesterday to corroborate this story.

Pam Johnson said she called 911 as soon as she saw Brent's overturned Mercedes on the road.

She told WFAA TV that when she got out
of the car, she saw Brent come around from behind the burning vehicle 
and asked him if anyone else was inside.

'Yes but he won't get out', Brent told
her, according to Ms Johnson, who then walked closer to the scene and 
saw Stacee McWilliams.

Though she asked the other woman if 
Brent was going to pull his friend out of the car or 'let him burn', she
told police she never heard Ms McWilliams demand that Brent save him.

She said she could hear moaning coming from the car but when he was finally pulled out he wasn't moving.

Ms Johnson told the TV station she believes Brent was merely in shock and didn't know what to do after the accident.

Irving police accused Brent of being drunk behind the wheel and charged 
him with one count of Intoxication Manslaughter. He's currently free on a
$500,000 bond.

A memorial for Jerry Brown was held yesterday as team members attended the service at Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship in Dallas.

Brown's mother, Stacey Jackson, had 
requested Brent meet her grieving family at the airport and sit with 
them at the memorial service, manager Jerry Jones had revealed on 
Tuesday morning.

'They're close,' Jones said on 105.3 
The Fan. 'It's so tragic when you think about that they were best 
friends. Josh was elated when Jerry came on the team because they were 
such good friends.'

Brown was a passenger in Brent's car 
as he drove through Irving in the early hours of Saturday. The defensive
tackle was reportedly speeding when he hit a curb, flipping the car.

Irving police said that 25-year-old Brown - who also was Brent's teammate for three seasons at the 
University of Illinois - was found unresponsive at the scene and 
pronounced dead at a hospital.

His funeral is scheduled for Friday in St Louis. Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple said the team is not expected to attend.

After the crash, police officers conducted a field sobriety 
test on Brent and arrested him on suspicion of driving while 
intoxicated. The charge, which is 
punishable by two to 20 years in prison, was upgraded after Brown was 
pronounced dead.

Cowboys coach Jason Garrett says the 
team would 'support Josh 100 per cent in every way that we can'. A 
spokesman says the NFL has 'no issue' with Brent being at team 
facilities.

'I am devastated and filled with 
grief,' Brent said in a statement released on Saturday to multiple media 
outlets by his agent Peter Schaffer.

'Filled with grief for the loss of my 
close friend and teammate, Jerry Brown. I am also grief-stricken for his
family, friends and all who were blessed enough to have known him.

'I will live with this horrific and 
tragic loss every day for the rest of my life. My prayers are with his 
family, our teammates and his friends at this time.'

Before the team's game on Sunday, the Bengals held a 
moment of silence before the national anthem. Most Cowboys bowed their 
heads, and Dallas quarterback Tony Romo and several other players had 
their hands over their hearts.

On
Fox's NFL Sunday show, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said the team had 
focused on Brown's death in the 'last few hours'. He didn't mention 
Brent.

'First of all we
all know, but we remind ourselves that there is something more 
important than football, and this is life, and certainly the lost life 
of Jerry,' Jones said on the TV show.

'On the other hand, they know the 
best way they can honor Jerry, because he was such a hard worker, so 
conscientious and enthusiastic about his career.'

It is not Brent's first brush with the law - or intoxication charge.

In February 2009, Brent was arrested 
in February 2009 near the Illinois campus for driving under the 
influence, driving on a suspended license and speeding, according to 
Champaign County, Illinois.

Sadness: Brent, who is charged with intoxication manslaughter, is out of jail on $500,000 bail

In June 2009, he pleaded guilty to
DUI and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, two years of probation, 200 
hours of community service and a fine of about $2,000.

As part of his 
plea deal, prosecutors dropped one count of aggravated DUI/no valid 
driver's license. Brent successfully completed his probation in July 
2011, court records show.

The Cowboys were preparing to fly to Cincinnati on Saturday for a Sunday game against the 
Bengals, when the team was told of the news, according to ESPN.

The players were told on the plane just 
before takeoff of what happened after non-team personnel were asked to 
go outside.

The Cowboys had signed Brown to their 
practice squad on October 24, but he hasn't been on the active roster. He was 
released from the Colts' practice squad on October 20. Brown played in one 
game for the Colts, a loss to the New York Jets on October 14.

His
death came a week after another NFL tragedy in which Kansas City Chiefs
player Jovan Belcher shot his girlfriend dead at their home before 
killing himself outside the team's stadium.
