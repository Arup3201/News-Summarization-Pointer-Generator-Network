A former New York socialite has been forced to don an unflattering orange jumpsuit and pick up the trash in Los Angeles after attacking her billionaire ex-boyfriend.

Taylor Stein, the daughter of legendary rock promoter Howard Stein, has a relationship that can best be described as fractious with her ex, former Estée Lauder CEO William Lauder.

Stein and Lauder were an item while he was still married and six years ago had a daughter together, Djuna.

Not long after the child’s birth, Lauder agreed to pay Stein $9.5 million through to the year 2017 on the proviso that she moved to California and wouldn't visit New York for more than two weeks a year. She also had to alert him six weeks in advance before her trips east.

Stein has since had to take Lauder to court after he attempted to renege on the deal, but the former love birds remain in contact and Lauder regularly sees his daughter.

It was on one of Lauders visits to California late last year that things got out of hand.

The New York Post reports that Stein punched Lauder in the face after the pair got into an argument on an L.A. street last November.

In 2011 Stein bought a black-market baby for $180,000 and then helped the FBI bring down the Ukrainian ring that sold him to her

Despite, or perhaps because of their history, Lauder choose to press charges and Stein was arrested and later released on $50,000 bail.

In May she pleaded guilty to misdemeanor domestic violence and was fined $1,834 and sentenced to 19 days of community service - cleaning streets for the California Department of Transportation.

The Post reports that Stein was spotted wearing orange coveralls as she swept trash in Santa Monica while completing her sentence last month.

She is due in court again on Oct. 30 for a progress report on her three years of probation.

Stein hit the headlines two years ago when she bought a black-market baby for $180,000 and in the process helped the FBI bring down the Ukrainian ring that sold him to her.

William Lauder, who divorced his wife Karen not long after news broke of his relationship with Stein, is the grandson of Estée Lauder and son of billionaire cosmetics heir Leonard Lauder.

His father recently called off his wedding – scheduled to take place last weekend - to a woman 25 years his junior.

Since July 2009 William Lauder has been Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the cosmetics giant, he had previously been CEO for five years.
