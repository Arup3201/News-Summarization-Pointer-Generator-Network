Brendan Rodgers has dismissed rumours Raheem Sterling could move away from Liverpool - stating the talented midfielder could be linked with every club in the world due to his footballing ability.

The Reds have made a sluggish start to their Premier League title challenge, sitting in 11th place ahead of the Merseyside derby against Everton on Saturday, with Sterling being one of the plus points in their jittery early season form.

The England forward has scored three goals this season and Rodgers says he is comfortable with speculation linking the 19-year-old away from Anfield as he knows his star player is grounded.

Speaking at the club's pre-match press conference on Thursday, Rodgers said: 'I think it shows that he is playing very well. You could link him with every club in the world. I sit easy with the speculation. Him and his representatives know how comfortable he is here. 

'At some point in the future he will be rewarded for his performance but he still has three years left on his contract. There is no rush. He had a breather against Aston Villa. He is a super-fit boy and he will be there at the weekend against Everton.'

Liverpool go into their fixture against Everton on the back of successive league defeats by Aston Villa and West Ham.

In the corresponding fixture last season, Rodgers' men romped to a 4-0 win thanks to a Daniel Sturridge double as well as goals from Steven Gerrard and Luis Suarez.

Despite the emphatic scoreline in January, Rodgers isn't expecting a similar outcome on Saturday. He has a host of new faces in his squad but did reveal that Sturridge could feature after missing the last few weeks with a thigh injury sustained on international duty.

'Sturridge has responded well to treatment and it is going well. He is out there on the field working. It will be great to have him back,' spoke Rodgers.

'His pace and movement is exceptional. We hope it will be this weekend but we will see. We won't rush him. If he is fit, he won't be match fit.

'Everton have quality. They have not had the results they will have wanted but Roberto [Martinez] is a great manager. Last season was really special. We were excellent in every aspect of the game. It's a really special game between two great clubs.

'We are reintroducing the principles that have given us the win ratio we have enjoyed over the last 18 months. When you introduce a raft of new players and lose the core, then it becomes a bit broken. I'm fortunate that I have a group that is all in it together.

Some have cited Liverpool's European commitments this season in the Champions League as the reason for their poor start to this campaign but Rodgers doesn't believe that is the case.

'It hasn't gone as well as we wanted. But if you look at the corresponding games from last season to this, there is only one point different,' he added.

'Playing in the Champions League is very exciting, we have got all these great games coming up and that is what you want as a manager and a player.

'There is an adjustment but it's not a distraction. We embrace it. We have lost influential players to how we play so I will be looking forward to the next international break with our full squad.

'Until then we will battle on. We have had positives from it. We entering into these games with a great opportunity.'
