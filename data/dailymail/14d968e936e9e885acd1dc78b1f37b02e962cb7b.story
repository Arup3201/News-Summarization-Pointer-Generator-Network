Louis Van Gaal is sweating on the fitness of Jonathan De Guzman after the Swansea City midfielder injured his hamstring in training.

De Guzman has forced his way into the Netherlands starting XI with recent displays but faces an anxious wait to discover his World Cup fate.

Van Gaal named the 26-year-old in his 23-man Dutch squad over the weekend and was planning to pick him for the opening game against Spain on June 13.

But Van Gaal revealed De Guzman will miss the friendly with Wales in Amsterdam on Wednesday night, adding: ‘He felt something in his hamstring and therefore I stopped the training session as were playing 11 v 11.

‘Now we have to wait and see in the coming days whether it is bad or not so bad. Hopefully it’s a light injury.

‘De Guzman has earned his position in the team. He had a rather good game against Ghana. I liked him. I said it to him. So now I have to adapt and play another player in his position which is always not so good.’

Blow: The Swansea City midfielder had looked as if he'd start the first World Cup game against Spain
