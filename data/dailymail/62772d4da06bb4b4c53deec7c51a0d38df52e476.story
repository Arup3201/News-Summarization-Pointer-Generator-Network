A criminal investigation has been launched into the death of Peaches Geldof as it was revealed she died after taking heroin.

Police yesterday said they want to know who supplied the 25-year-old journalist and TV personality with the drug.

There are also serious questions over why there was no drug-taking paraphernalia in her home by the time authorities arrived.

Heroin was said to have played a role in the death of Peaches Geldof, an inquest has heard. Peaches' mother Paula Yates died from an accidental overdose in 2000, aged 41

DCI Paul Fotheringham confirmed the drug 'contributed' to her death during a short statement as the inquest into the mother-of-two's death opened

Detectives could now question her 
husband, musician Thomas Cohen, who was the first person to find her 
body before raising the alarm, saying he could not revive her.

The
 investigation was begun as the opening of an inquest into the death 
yesterday confirmed that Peaches had died after taking a potentially 
lethal hit of heroin while in sole charge of her baby son Phaedra.

The
 brief hearing was told how Mr Cohen screamed as he returned home to 
find his wife slumped across her bed, with one leg dangling off the 
side.

The incident has 
tragic similarities to the death of Peaches’ mother Paula Yates, who 
died from an accidental heroin overdose in 2000, aged 41.

She was discovered alone with her young daughter Tiger Lily, then four.

The senior officer from Kent POlice told the hearing at Gravesend Coroners Court  the model was in contact with friends in the days before her death and  there was no 'cause for concern'

Coroner Roger Hatch adjourned Ms Geldof's inquest until July 23

On
 the day of her death, Peaches had posted a picture of herself as a 
young girl with her late mother – although she was said to have been her
 ‘normal self’ before the incident.

Kent
 Police detective chief inspector Paul Fotheringham told the inquest she
 had been making ‘plans for the future’, but that ‘recent use of heroin 
and the levels identified were likely to have played a role in her 
death’.

After Peaches was 
found on Monday, April 7, police said the death was unexplained but 
ruled out any suggestion of third party involvement.

However,
 because no drug  paraphernalia was found at the scene, there are now 
questions over who supplied the heroin and whether there was a clear-up 
before authorities arrived. Last night, Kent Police declined to comment 
on whether Mr Cohen, former singer with  the band S.C.U.M., had been or 
would be questioned, and would not elaborate on details of  the 
investigation.

They added that no one had yet been arrested or interviewed under caution over the death.

A spokesman confirmed, however, that the force was probing the supply of the drugs likely to have killed Peaches.

Peaches’s family did not attend yesterday’s ten-minute hearing, with the full inquest expected to begin in late July.

Tragic: The opening of an inquest into Peaches Geldof's death yesterday revealed she had taken heroin - prompting police to launch a probe to establish who supplied her with the fatal class A drug

Gravesend
 Old Town Hall heard details of the moment the mother of two was 
discovered dead at the home she shared with Mr Cohen and their sons, 
Astala, 23 months, and 11-month-old Phaedra in Wrotham, Kent. Mr Cohen, 
23, had left his wife alone at the £1million property four days 
beforehand to spend the weekend at his parents’ home in south-east 
London.

It was said to be a 
regular arrangement that allowed the couple to focus on their work. 
While she was in the house, Peaches remained in constant contact with 
family and friends and was making plans for the future, said Mr 
Fotheringham.

At 5pm the 
night before the tragedy, Mr Cohen’s father Keith took Phaedra back to 
Wrotham and spent half an hour with Peaches before leaving.

The
 last contact with her is thought to have been at 7.45pm that evening, 
when she had a  telephone conversation with a friend. ‘All of the 
friends and family who had contact with Peaches during this period 
described how she seemed her normal self and was making plans for the 
future, including a family outing for her sons for the following 
weekend,’ Mr Fotheringham added. ‘There was no cause for concern.’

The
 following morning, Mr Cohen could not get hold of his wife and decided 
to return home with his mother, Sue, and his other son, Astala, at about
 1.30pm. After discovering his wife’s body, he screamed out to his 
mother and rushed to find his baby son before calling 999 five minutes 
later.

Mr Fotheringham added: ‘Thomas entered the property and went upstairs thinking that Peaches may have been sleeping.

‘Thomas
 then located Peaches in a spare bedroom and it was obvious to him that 
she was deceased.  She was located on the edge of a bed with one leg 
hanging down to the floor with the other leg tucked underneath her; she 
was slumped forward across the bed.’

Police and paramedics arrived and confirmed she had died.

A
 post-mortem examination carried out by Dr Peter Jerreat at Darent 
Valley Hospital in Dartford was subsequently inconclusive. Further tests
 have now confirmed heroin had been taken, Mr Fotheringham said.

Peaches
 was buried last month in a coffin decorated with a picture of her young
 family at the church near Faversham where she married just two years 
ago.

It was also where her parents – Miss Yates and Sir Bob Geldof – tied the knot in 1986 and where her mother’s funeral was held.

A
 police spokesman said: ‘Kent Police can confirm an ongoing 
investigation into the supply of drugs in connection with the death of 
Peaches Geldof.’

Coroner Roger Hatch adjourned the inquest until July 23.

Peaches was just 11 when her mother Paula Yates was found 
dead after a heroin overdose.

When her body was discovered in her Notting Hill, west London home, 
in 2000, Peaches' four-year-old sister Tiger Lily was found playing 
nearby by a family friend.

The
 25-year-old had recently spoken of feeling the presence of her late 
mother keenly as she walked down the aisle of St Mary Magdalene and St 
Lawrence Church.

Speaking to
 Aga Living magazine, published in the Sunday Times, Peaches said she 
felt her TV presenter mother was 'living through me all the time because
 we are just so similar'.

Just
 weeks before her untimely death, Peaches Geldof spoke of the hopes she 
harboured for her two young children, but revealed she had not fully 
made peace with her own childhood. - but that she had with her mother.

The last message she posted online was a picture of her as a toddler with her mother.

In
 a tragic final interview the late star said it was through being a 
mother that she had reconciled herself with her memories of her own 
mother, Paula Yates, who died in 2000 at 41 from an accidental heroin 
overdose.

Explaining that 
being a mother to her two sons - Astala, two, and one-year-old 
Phaedra - had allowed her to achieve a new understanding of the world, 
she said: 'I'm not sure I've yet fully made peace with my childhood, but
 with my mum I have come to terms with everything.

'There
 are so many parallels between us. Now I can understand everything. I 
think you have to experience hardships and pain yourself to fully 
understand people who have been through it and also you can never really
 experience happiness unless you've had that down feeling too.'

She
 added: 'The way I've been raising them (her sons) is with pure love. I 
just have a lot of hopes for them, and I hope when they're older they 
get to have a bit of the youth that I lost out on when I had them. Now I
 am a mum, I can correct those awful parts of my childhood and it's a 
really healing process.

'Before,
 I was not at peace with myself about it because I was just traumatised.
 That's why I was living a chaotic lifestyle. But now I have the kids I 
can heal the situation. It's so good in every single way, really.'
