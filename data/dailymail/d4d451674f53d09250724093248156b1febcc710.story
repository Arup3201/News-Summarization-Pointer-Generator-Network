David de Gea is set to stay at Manchester United, according to his agent.

The Spaniard, whose contract expires at the end of next season, has been strongly linked with a move to Real Madrid.

But De Gea's representative, Jorge Mendes, believes the talented goalkeeper will remain at Old Trafford.

'He has one year left on his contract and I think that he will stay in Manchester,' Mendes told the BBC. 'The player will decide, but he's happy there, at the moment.'

Mendes' comments will come as a relief to United fans who were growing increasingly concerned that the 24-year-old, signed from Atletico Madrid for £17.8m in 2011, would be on his way.

Last week manager Louis van Gaal, when asked about the keeper's future, admitted 'everything is possible'. He added: 'We would like to keep him.'

If Mendes' comments are anything to go by it looks like they will be doing just that.

Lisbon-born Mendes has risen from DJ bar owner in Porto, where he became friends with numerous professional footballers, to one of the most powerful agents in the modern game.

Mendes represents De Gea, as well as Jose Mourinho, Luiz Felipe Scolari, Radamel Falcao and James Rodriguez and also negotiated Angel di Maria’s £59.7m move to Manchester United.

But it’s Cristiano Ronaldo, who joined Real Madrid from United for £80m in 2009, that is his most important client.

Ronaldo’s move to La Liga was a record-breaking fee in its time but Mendes claims it will not be long before a club forks out over £200m as well as revealing Ronaldo’s sizeable buyout clause at Madrid.

Mendes told the BBC: ‘He’s the most expensive player in the world because he’s the best footballer, the best sportsman ever in the world.

‘It’s impossible to say his worth. Cristano Ronaldo? One billion. His buyout clause is one billion, so it is one billion.

‘If for any reason they decided to sell him tomorrow for £300m, someone would pay. He loves the Manchester United supporters because he was there six years he but he will finish his career at Real Madrid, for sure.’

‘Clubs like Manchester United or Real Madrid, if a player is worth £200m, of course they can do it,’ said Mendes, who also said players are worth even more than clubs are currently paying.

‘The most important part of the game is the players,’ he said. 'They deserve the maximum amount possible. Of course there is a limit but you can pay until this limit. I think the limit may be in three years or maybe after that.’
