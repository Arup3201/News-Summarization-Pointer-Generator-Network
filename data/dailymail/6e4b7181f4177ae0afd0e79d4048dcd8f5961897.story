Police in the Philippines abused suspected criminals with a 'wheel of torture' game, according to human rights groups.

The officers are accused of using the cruel game of chance while interrogating people thought to be drug traffickers.

A photograph of the wheel obtained by the Commission on Human Rights shows a variety of punishments occupying different amounts of space on the wheel.

Victims claimed they have been beaten up, electrocuted and hit by steel bars and baseball bats in the course of the officers' abuse. One said police pointed a gun at him, while another accused them of 
threatening his relatives.

One of the sections of the wheel is labelled '20 seconds Manny Pacman' - the nickname of Manny Pacquiao, a famous Filipino boxer. If the wheel landed there, detainees were punched by officers.

Other spaces are marked with the words 'zombies' and 'duck walk', though it is unclear what the punishments entail.

A police spokesman said that several officers have been suspended while the practice is investigated.

But Amnesty international, which brought the existence of the wheel to light, has said the police's 'despicable' and 'abhorrent' actions require the officers to be tried as criminals.

The Philippines has a history of torture and rights abuses left over from when it was ruled by brutal dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Thousands of his regime's victims won a law suit against the former leader's estate in 1992.

Current president Benigno Aquino III, son of leaders who fought Marcos, has pledged to prosecute violators of human rights, though campaigners say this has done nothing to stop abuses.

The 'wheel of torture' is allegedly stationed at a police building in Binan town, in a province south of the capital Manila.

According to the Human Rights Commission, the building is not an official detention centre, and was holding prisoners illegally.Â 

A spokesman for the commission said 
they investigated the claims investigated after being tipped off several
 weeks ago about alleged abuses against more than 40 prisoners.

The
 comission has urged top police officials to pursue criminal complaints 
against about 10 officers who were implicated in the abuses.

A spokesman for Amnesty International said: 'For police officers to use torture "for fun" is despicable.'

These are abhorrent acts. Suspending officers is not enough. Errant police personnel and their commanding officers should be held accountable in a court of law.'

An anti-torture law in the Philippines was passed in 2009.

In 2010, all 11 officers in a Manila police station were relieved of duties after footage emerged of them allegedly hitting a naked robbery suspect.

The video showed the suspect screaming on the floor as a man pulled a string bound around his genitals.
