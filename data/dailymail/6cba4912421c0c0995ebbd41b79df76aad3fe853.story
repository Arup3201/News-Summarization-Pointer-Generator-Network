Joleon Lescott has told his West Bromwich Albion team-mates they need to take the blame for the dire form which has left them two points and two places above the relegation zone.

The Baggies lost 2-1 at home to West Ham on Tuesday night - their fourth straight defeat in the Premier League. 

And with pressure on manager Alan Irvine mounting Lescott said: ‘The manager tends to get the stick but the players need to realise what we’re doing is not good enough, we’re not picking up any points.’ 

West Brom defender Joleon Lescott says the players are to blame for their poor form, not boss Alan Irvine

‘It’s not great for anyone. They (the fans) can vent their frustration but they have to realise we want to win as well — just as much as them.’

The 32-year-old joined the club on a free transfer from defending champions Manchester City in the summer.

The England international has made 10 appearances for the Hawthorns outfit in defence since his arrival.
