Apple is following Google's lead by adding a feature to its upcoming operating system that can track a user's every step.

German security firm Protecus has found a setting in the fifth beta release of Apple's iOS 7 software called Feature Locations that tracks a user's GPS coordinates over time and plots them on a map. 

This news comes after code was discovered in Google's Android 4.3 software that lets devices scan for nearby networks, in order to determine a person's location, even when Wi-Fi is turned off.

It is unclear if the Frequent Location feature is turned on by default but it can be disabled

The Apple feature is relatively hidden away on the iOS 7 software - due to be released in October - in Settings, Privacy, Location Services, System Services and Frequent Locations.

It is unclear whether the feature is turned on by default but according to the Protecus security expert: '[The feature] kept track of my complete movement profile (location and time tracking) without me knowing anything.'

He does continue, however, that the feature can be disabled.

Frequent Locations is part of a wider Apple feature called Improve Maps set up to make the device's built-in mapping technology more accurate. 

Apps such as Foursquare track locations in a similar way, but only when a user actively checks-in.

The maps created using Frequent Location can be used by people to see where they have been and the locations they visit most often.

Apple's disclaimer about the feature says: 'If
you choose to enable Improve Maps, Apple will collect the GPS 
coordinates obtained through the Frequent Locations feature on your 
device and correlate them with the street address associated with your 
Apple ID.

A string of developer code discovered in the fourth beta release of Apple's iOS 7 software, pictured, gives the strongest indication to date that either the iPhone 5S or the iPhone 6 could have a fingerprint scanner

'This will enable Apple to better approximate the geographic location of that and other addresses.

'Apple
will only retain the resulting coordinates in an anonymous form to 
improve Maps and other Apple location-based products and services.'

Earlier this week, reports emerged that Google's latest Android phone 
operating system includes a feature that will scan for networks and 
track user's locations even when Wi-Fi has been turned off.

The
code used to build Android 4.3 claims that 'to improve location 
accuracy and for other purposes, Google and other apps may scan for 
nearby networks even when Wi-Fi is off.'

A string of code discovered in the latest beta release of Apple's iOS 7 software implies that either the iPhone 5S or iPhone 6 could come with a fingerprint scanner. 

The code describes a user touching the Home button with their thumb. A fingerprint then appears on the screen, that changes colour - presumably to signify a match - and the 'recognition is complete'. A folder called Biometric Kit was also found.

The iPhone 5S could additionally have a slow-motion camera.

More code discovered in iOS 7 suggests phones running the software will be able to record video at a rate of 120 frames-per-second (FPS) rather than around 30 frames per second.This is fast enough to allow iPhone users to create slow-motion films.  

The iOS 7 software also lets users swipe between menus, select apps and control the device's screen using just head movements.

When the Switch Control feature is enabled, it will scroll through and highlight different onscreen sections - including individual menus and apps. When the required section is highlighted, users can move their head to the left to select it.

Other new features include Night Mode in Maps that responds to ambient light when you use it in the dark.

FaceTime audio can be used to make high-quality calls over a data network and Notification Sync lets you dismiss a notification so that it is dismissed on all of your devices.

By identifying nearby Wi-Fi networks a device can determine a user's location and it can be used as an alternative to GPS.

Google's feature is turned off by default and can be enabled, or disabled, in Settings.

Apple's new iOS 7 software was unveiled in June.

It has a ‘flat 
design’, but critics say the dramatic new look could backfire, confusing
users - while others claim it simply looks like Google’s rival Android 
system.

It will be available for users to download from October but beta versions of the software are being rolled out to developers.

Developers can use the software to build apps in preparation for when the operating system it officially released as well as test it for bugs.

A folder called Biometric Kit, pictured, was also found and the feature could be for security reasons to unlock the phone, or to authorise payments in the App Store and prevent people from stealing your phone, reading your messages or obtaining personal data
