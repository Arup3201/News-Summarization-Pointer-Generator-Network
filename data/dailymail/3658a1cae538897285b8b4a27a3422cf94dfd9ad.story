In the midst of a foul-mouthed tirade in a London cinema, Tyson Fury has struck a side bet with Dereck Chisora as to who will win their world heavyweight title eliminator in Manchester on Saturday week.

Whether the bet is for £10,000, £100,000 or winner takes all the purse was unclear amid the four-letter mayhem.

What is certain is that British boxing has taken its first steps down from the honourable peak reached with Carl Froch's victory over George Groves in front of 80,000 people at Wembley.

Fury's descent into the f-word, the c-word, the s-word and every other initial word imaginable was accompanied by a gutter of gross sexual references and insults.

In most other sports the Manchester giant of the prize ring would be facing either a ban or a heavy fine for bringing the game into disrepute.

Boxing tends to turn a blind eye to what is considered to be promotional activity, as it has done with similar outbursts at previous events during the build-up for this particular encounter.

At one, in Manchester, Fury was busy swearing and turning over tables.

The stage is set: Fury and Chisora attend a press conference at a west London cinema

Londoner Chisora managed to remain largely restrained in the face of unpleasant mocking of his manhood but was the first to provoke a wager.

He shouted: 'I bet you 10 grand I knock you out.'

Fury responded: '10 grand is chump money to me. I give the kids that to go to the shops. Make it winner takes all... or at least 100 grand.'

Chisora charged forward and said: 'OK, let's shake on it.'

Foul language: Fury was not to concerned about his words as he traded insults with Chisora

The clasping of hands was as near as Fury came to civilised behaviour but was still an ugly, tugging and shoving affair.

British Boxing Board of Control regulations forbid fighters from betting on the sport with bookmakers but side stakes are permitted.

Chisora lost his personal wager with David Haye and after being knocked out at West Ham's Upton Park stadium paid the £20,000 to charity.

As the profanities continued, Chisora said: 'I must apologise on behalf of my opponent for his language.'

Fury gave this angry retort: 'I don't give a f*** how many women and children are in the audience. We're getting near to the fight and I'm in fight mode, kill mode.'

That is just a sample of how unsavoury it was.

Each promised to knock the other out and be the one to go on to challenge Wladimir Klitschko for the WBO heavyweight title.

That could be sometime in the making, although whether the high class Klitschko camp will want to involve themselves in such shenanigans has to be open to question.

Promoter Frank Warren, who is also Chisora's manager, has been going to considerable lengths to sell the July 26 spectacle in Manchester at a time when the run-up to this rematch has been overshadowed by the World Cup finals.

But he moved to end quickly this last head-to-head meeting in London.

Warren said: 'It's not easy getting all of this together with so much interest in the World Cup but we're getting there.'

This fracas in a west London cinema was not of his making.

Whether or not it boosts ticket sales and television subscriptions, it is not much help for the image of boxing.
