It starts with just one bad decision, but ends with the most dire of consequences.

A shocking public health video aimed at tackling obesity shows how a parent's influence can lead to a lifetime of unhealthy eating and, ultimately, have potentially fateful outcomes.

The video, released by the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, works its way backwards from the moment Jim is taken into hospital after suffering a heart attack at the age of 32.

A shocking public health video aimed at tackling obesity shows how a parent's influence can lead to a lifetime of unhealthy eating and, ultimately, have potentially fateful outcomes

The video rewinds through Jim's life, to reveal a pattern of unhealthy eating and a sedentary lifestyle, leading to him being taken to hospital after suffering a heart attack at the age of 32

The video, taken from Jim's point of view, shows doctors inspecting him as he lies on the hospital bed, struggling to breathe, weighing 300lb.

'How the hell does that happen?' asks one of the doctors, before a series of shots rewinds to Jim's childhood to show how a lifetime of bad choices was started with one made by his mother.

The video shows Jim at various stages in his life eating unhealthy foods and sitting around watching television or playing computer games.   

The short-film however goes back to Jim's childhood to show how his unhealthy eating habits were in fact precipitated by his parents - various scenes show his mother feeding him sugary breakfast cereals and even French fries as a baby. 

The video is aimed at teaching parents to instil healthy eating habits into their children at a young age.

The video also shows how numerous doctor's warnings were not fully heeded, including those made when Jim was a child

The organisation's website says: 'As a parent, you might be thinking “I’ve done some of those things!”

'Don’t worry; we didn’t create the video to make you feel guilty. We created it to fast-forward to the year 2030 to show you what the future might look like for Georgia’s kids if we don’t act now. The choices we teach kids today become the habits they take into the future.'

The video, which was published to YouTube by CHA in September last year, has gained attention in recent days after it was widely shared on social networking sites.

While many viewers have commented on the effect it has had on them, some obesity experts have raised concerns over the 'shock' tactics.

Obesity researcher Ted Kyle told Yahoo Health: 'If you want to draw attention to yourself and your campaign, then this is a helpful video. If what you want is to have a helpful effect on childhood obesity, the research is clear that shocking and stigmatizing doesn’t really help.'

He said studies had shown shaming and stigmatizing people was not an effective way of altering a person's behaviour.

Meanwhile, a recent study by researchers at Griffith University, in Queensland, has found children born to obese mothers are 50 per cent more likely to end up in hospital in the first five years of their lives.

The world-first study followed almost 3,000 Queensland mothers and their children over a five-year period.

Researchers found conditions of the nervous system, infections, metabolic conditions, perinatal conditions, injuries and respiratory conditions were more prevalent in children of obese mothers.

Doctor Cate Cameron said the study, published in the International Journal Of Obesity, is good evidence pre-pregnancy weight has direct effect on complications when getting pregnant.
