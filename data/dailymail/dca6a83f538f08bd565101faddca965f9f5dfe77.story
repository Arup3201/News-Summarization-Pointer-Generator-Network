Arrest: Jose Osorio, pictured, was arrested on Friday after witnesses reported he fired multiple shots at two parked cars

A Massachusetts man faces multiple charges after allegedly shooting cars left in parking spots that had been shoveled of snow after the blizzard.

Jose Osorio was arrested on Friday after witnesses reported that he fired multiple shots at two parked cars that were in spaces that had been shoveled on a street in Fall River, Massachusetts.

Neighbors also overhead him banging on doors and yelling about the cars that were parked in the street shortly before he opened fire. 

Lt. Ronald Furtado, of the Fall River Police Department told ABC News: 'During the course of the investigation the fact came up that he was observed yelling and banging on doors in the neighborhood about vehicles parked out in the street.

He added: 'Additional facts came to light that he had produced a handgun and fired at two of the vehicles.'

Furtado  believes that Osorio had shoveled the parking spaces that were then occupied. He added that when officers arrived they found Osorio in the area and later found a handgun at his address.

The gunman now faces multiple charges, including carrying a firearm without a license, carrying a firearm after being convicted of a violent crime and discharging a firearm within 500 feet of a dwelling.

During the blizzard, Massachusetts was walloped with snowfall of up to two to three feet across eastern Massachusetts.
