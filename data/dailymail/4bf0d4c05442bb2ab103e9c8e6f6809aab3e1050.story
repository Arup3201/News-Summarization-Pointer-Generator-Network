U.S. Vice President Joe Biden called Hispanics ‘the center of the nation's future’ on Thursday as he rallied Latino Congress members to push for immigration reform.

He also reminded those in attendance that their political influence will continue to grow in the years ahead.

Biden delivered his impassioned speech at a ceremonial event on Capitol Hill hosted by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, a nonpartisan group that works to encourage Latino leadership in politics.

‘The way to make the mark is for the Hispanic community to step up and step out and let the world know, let the Republicans know, let others know that if you ignore the needs and concerns of the Hispanic community, you will not win,’ Biden said.

He also said that United States citizens recognize what Latinos -- both documented and undocumented – are capable of contributing to the country.

‘It's no longer about what can be done for the Hispanic community,’ he said. ‘The question is what the Hispanic community is going to do to take this country to a totally new place.’

There are now three senators and 33 House members of Latino descent in the 113th Congress; a new record.

Many of those leaders are strong supporters of immigration reform, which ranks high -- though not first -- on the list of priorities among Latino voters, according to the Huffington Post.

While the majority of Hispanics in Congress are Democrats, several of the most prominent figures are GOP members.

Biden said on Thursday he was hopeful that Republicans would join the immigration reform effort in the U.S.

He said the Republican party had undergone a ‘rapid epiphany’ in the wake of their election defeat in November.

Meanwhile, President Barack Obama said that he plans to begin taking major steps towards immigration reform this month, now that the ‘fiscal cliff’ conflict has been resolved.

Obama said in June that his administration would stop deporting young people who had been brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents as children.

Similarly, the Department of Homeland Security announced new rules this week that will make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to stay in the United States as they seek permanent residency.

Prior to that, the majority of undocumented immigrants were forced to return to their home countries to apply for U.S. citizenship.

Obama won more than 70 per cent of the Latino vote in his re-election bid in November, according to exit polls.

During his re-election campaign, he said his administration’s inability to carry out substantial immigration reform was one of the biggest regrets of his first term.
