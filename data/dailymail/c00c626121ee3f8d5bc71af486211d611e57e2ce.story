A mechanic is believed to have murdered his wife and then killed himself when he was hit by a train.

Nigel Maude, 58, died on the tracks near the rural village of Hoghton, Lancashire, on Sunday morning.

British Transport Police went to his home nearby to inform his wife of 30 years Judith where they found her body in an upstairs bedroom.

Tragedy: Police found the body of Judith Maude in the upstairs bedroom of their home in Hoghton, Lancashire

Investigation: Nigel Maude died after throwing himself in front of a train in the village on Sunday morning

Detectives with Lancashire Police have now started a murder investigation but say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. 

Today, neighbours spoke of their shock at the deaths of a 'happy and quiet' couple, who had two daughters and four grandchildren.

Mr Maude worked as a mechanic and lived with his wife in a semi-detached home in Charles Crescent in Hoghton. They had lived there since inheriting the property from his parents.

Next door neighbour, Celia Livesey: 'They were a devoted couple and all they lived for was their family. They were very quiet and very pleasant. I only really saw them to say hello over the fence.

'They loved their grandchildren, they had four grandchildren, one girl and three boys.

'The first time I knew anything was about 8.30pm and saw all the police and the ambulance.

'Judith didn’t work and Nigel worked at Leyland Motors, I don’t think he was retired. I’m just so shocked, I really can’t believe it.'

Another neighbour, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'I knew them both, if you were to say "who is a couple who never argued" you would say them.

'I had known him since primary school and known Judith since she was 15. I still can’t believe it has happened.'

Shock: Neighbours described the Maudes as a 'happy and quiet' couple

'He served as a mechanic before going to Leyland Motors. I don’t think he has been very well and I think he may have been in hospital but I don’t know why.

'They were together all the time. They liked walking. They have been married 30-odd years.

'You couldn’t ask for a nicer couple and couldn’t find a bad word to say about him. He was a Preston North End supporter.

'He couldn’t fall out with anyone if he tried. He was a real family man, he was devoted to his grandchildren.'

Another neighbour said: 'We think the police came to the house to tell Judith and nobody came to the door. The door was open and they came in and found Judith upstairs.

'The way it’s looking is that he has killed her and then killed himself. The kept themselves to themselves, but they always had their grandchildren with them.'

Discovery: Officers from British Transport Police had gone to inform Judith Maude of her husband's death after he was hit by a train

A Lancashire Police spokesman said: 'A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found at an address in Hoghton on Sunday, August 11.

'Around 8.35pm police were called to an address on Charles Crescent where the body of a woman aged in her 50s was found in an upstairs bedroom. A post mortem examination will take place later today to establish the cause of her death.

'The house remains sealed off whilst an investigation takes place.

'The woman’s death is believed to be linked to an earlier incident that took place at 10.55am near to Chapel Lane, Hoghton, where the body of a 58 year old man was found on the track having been hit by a train. His death is not being treated as suspicious.'

Detective Superintendent Paul Withers from the Force Major Investigation Team said: 'An investigation is underway to establish the circumstances of exactly what has happened. We are still at the very early stages of our enquiry but at this moment in time we do not believe we are looking for anyone else in connection with the enquiry.'
