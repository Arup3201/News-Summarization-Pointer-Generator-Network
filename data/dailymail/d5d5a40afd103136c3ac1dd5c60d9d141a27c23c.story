Google has been touting the benefits of its self-driving cars for years, so a team of stuntmen decided to put the technology to the test.

Five drivers steered automated Hyundai Genesis’ into a convoy before driving towards a lorry at a test track in California.

This video reveals the moment the leading car stops just in time, and ultimately causes the four cars behind it to all stop too.

A stunt to demonstrate the emergency stop capabilities of the Hyundai 
driverless car has been carried out. A series of cars were driven in a 
convoy then all the drivers, except for the first, jumped from the 
moving cars onto a flatbed lorry. A lorry in front of the procession 
then braked suddenly, forcing them to stop autonomously

New laws are to be drawn up to allow driverless cars to take to Britain’s roads.

Ministers admit the current Highway Code and rules of the road are inadequate for the new generation of vehicles which pilot themselves.

With technology being developed on both sides of the Atlantic, the government wants to ensure that Britain is not overtaken by Google’s determination to see its cars used legally on the streets of California.

In May Google unveiled 
its computerised ‘hands-free’ self-driving bubble car, which has no 
steering wheel, brake or accelerator pedals, just buttons for start, 
pull over and emergency stop and a computer screen showing your route.

These tests were carried out at the Mojave Desert, California.

As they went around the track at speeds of 50 miles (80 kilometres) per hour, the motorists switched on the smart cruise control and lane assist features, which allowed the cars to drive the 6.4-mile (10.3km) circuit unaided.

At this point, a large lorry with a flatbed drove alongside and four of the stuntmen climbed out through the roofs, and jumped unaided onto the back of the HGV.

Only the driver at the front of the convoy stayed in the car, knowing there were four cars travelling behind him with no-one at the wheel.

He then crossed his arms, with the lorry pulling up in front and slamming on the brakes.

The Hyundai's automatic emergency braking system immediately kicked in and the car came to a standstill before it could smash into the truck.

The remaining driver, who was in the lead car of the five-strong convoy behind the lorry, put on a blindfold and let the driverless technology in the car take the wheel - and the pedals

The lorry at the front of the procession than braked heavily and the driverless technology reacted - the convoy of Hyundai cars automatically responded and stopped safely with the blindfolded driver. Pictured is the moment the blindfolded motorist relied on auto braking to stop his car smashing into the lorry

The Lane Keeping Assist System enables the cars to stay within the white lines of the road without any input from the driver, and it also monitor's the car's speed and watches out for obstacles as well

The four driverless cars behind also slammed the brakes on - preventing a serious accident.

Hyundai's 'Empty Car Convoy' was shot in California by London-based creative agency The Viral Factory, with Top Gear director Kit Lynch Robinson.

Ed Robinson, creative director, said: ‘As we watched the stunt men jump from their cars, leaving the empty car convoy speeding around the track, we nervously realised what an insane idea it was.

‘Happily the cars did exactly what Hyundai promised they could and all drivers and vehicles came out unscathed.
