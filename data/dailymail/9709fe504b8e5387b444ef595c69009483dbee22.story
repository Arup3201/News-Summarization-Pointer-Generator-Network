Greece has been forced subject itself to a number of austerity measures in order to get a four-month extension to its bailout, despite an election promise not to compromise.

Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras and his left-wing Syriza party swept to victory in the general election last month after promising to end the austerity measures imposed by the eurozone.

Greece's reform plan, which was approved by its EU creditors today, backed down on key leftist measures and promised that spending to alleviate social distress would not derail its budget to repay the €240billion bailout deal.

Mr  Tsipras based his election campaign on a pledge to renegotiate the bailout deal and reverse many of the reforms that eurozone creditors demanded in exchange for keeping Greece financially afloat since 2010.

Just last week, Mr Tsipras was ignoring calls from across Europe to compromise on the plan to extend the bailout and promised the electorate that Athens would not climb down from its pre-election pledges. 

'We are not in a hurry and we will not compromise,' Mr Tsipras told his party's lawmakers in parliament last week.

'We are working hard for an honest and mutually beneficial deal, a deal without austerity, without the bailout which has destroyed Greece in recent years, a deal without the toxic presence of the (bailout inspecting) troika.' 

He also promised that a labour bill which had previously been scrapped by EU and International Monetary Fund lenders, would soon be presented alongside another one to deal with the 'humanitarian crisis' in Greece, he said.

Despite these promises to his parliament last week, Mr Tsipras has been forced to concede defeat and undertake a list of reforms to prevent Greek from possible bankruptcy. 

In its list of reforms, the Greek government pledges not to roll back any privatizations that have already been completed and to 'respect the process, according to the law,' of any tenders that have already been launched. 

Privatization was one of the elements of Greece's bailout that Mr Tsipras' Syriza party had promised to cancel.

It has also promised to combat tax evasion and corruption, reduce bureaucracy, review public spending, modernize the pension system, reform the judicial system and address rising poverty through measures that have 'no fiscal effect.'

The letter is a general outline of policies and does not include any figures or specific details on how the policies will be achieved. 

Greece's creditors in the 19-country eurozone, the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund, approved the list of reforms on Tuesday. 

The approval of Greece's list of proposed reforms came following a meeting by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs at the European Parliament in Brussels on Tuesday

'The three institutions agreed to start the process with this. They thought it was a serious enough list and all the countries have just agreed with that in the meeting so we can start,' said eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem on RTL television.

Though the reform measures were welcomed, the eurozone ministers said Greece had to take further steps to flesh out the details.

'We call on the Greek authorities to further develop and broaden the list of reform measure,' the eurozone said in a statement.

So far, the reform list 'is sufficiently comprehensive to be a valid starting point,' EU Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici wrote.

'We are encouraged by the commitment to combat tax evasion and corruption ... as well as to pursue reforms to modernize the public administration.' 

Moscovici said he would work 'with the new administration to elaborate what are at the moment still general commitments and transform these into clear policy actions.'
