Carlo Ancelotti has now gone where no Real Madrid manager has ever gone before – winning his 16th straight match.

Real Madrid’s 2-1 victory over Malaga took the team’s winning streak to a new record, going past the 15-match run that Jose Mourinho managed in the 2011-12 season and Miguel Muñoz in the 1960-61 campaign.

Real beat Malaga with goals from Karim Benzema and Gareth Bale to move further clear at the top of La Liga ahead of Barcelona’s meeting with Valencia on Sunday.

Malaga came into the game unbeaten at home and had only conceded two goals. 

But Madrid had Benzema on a run of scoring in four straight games, Isco going back where he shone for Malaga in the Champions League and scored 14 goals in 69 matches, and Ronaldo who had already scored 20 goals in 11 games and they were always going to prove to be their biggest challenge of the season.

Real started strongly and Ronaldo almost scored on 12 minutes when played in by Bale on the edge of the six-yard box. The Portuguese striker got his shot away quickly but Carlos Kameni made the reflex save.

Malaga responded with their first chance and Iker Casillas needed to be at his best to tip of a header from Roque Santa Cruz over the bar.

Madrid took the lead on 18 minutes when Roanldo stormed down the left and crossed for Karim Benzema to poke the ball past Kameni. 

Benzema could have scored from another Ronaldo assist on the half hour when Ronaldo’s free-kick was saved by Kameni and ran to the Frenchman but Rosales reacted quickly and cleared.

Five minutes before the break Ronaldo slipped a pass through for Bale but Kameni came off his line quickly to palm the ball away for a corner. 

The home side’s keeper was keeping Malaga in the game and just before the break they so nearly took full advantage of that when Duda hammered a free-kick against Casillas’ cross-bar.

Real kept up the pressure in the second half with Bale heading just over from Kroos’ free-kick and Isco charging through only to see Kameni smother his shot.

All the time there was just one goal in the game Malaga sensed they had a chance and Santa Cruz went close from a corner with a header that just cleared the crossbar.

Malaga were also boosted by signs of fatigue from Madrid. 

Benzema went off exhausted with 15 minutes left to be replaced by Asier Illaramendi but any number of tired Madrid players could have made way.

Madrid’s incredible winning run began back in October when they beat Basel 5-1 in the Champions League.

They had won 10 games in the league and four more in Europe since then with two victories over Liverpool and big Clasico victory over Barcelona the standout results.

But they came into the game with some concerns about fatigue. 

Midfielder Toni Kroos has played an incredible 88 games in the last year and a half and had to start this game with Madrid coping without the injured Luka Modric.

Ronaldo missed a great late chance to score a second when a defensive lapse allowed him to connect with a Bale cross but Kameni again made the save. That made for a nervous last ten minutes and a Casillas fumble almost let Santa Cruz in but Illaramendi cleared to prevent the goal.

With seven minutes left Bale brought an end to the anxiety when Ronaldo flicked the ball into his path and the Welshman stormed through taking two touches to get the ball out of his feet before he hammered it past Kameni.

There still some more late drama when Isco was harshly sent off for a second yellow card offence, Juanpi hit a post from a corner and Santa Cruz converted a 92nd minute header. 

It was, however, just a consolation as Madrid took the points and Ancelotti took the record.
