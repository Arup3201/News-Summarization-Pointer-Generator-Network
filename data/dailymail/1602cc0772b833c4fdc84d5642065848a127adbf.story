This is the blood-stained rock used by a rapist to hit his 18-year-old victim over the head 20 times before sexually assaulting her in a harrowing attack 

Police have also released CCTV footage of a man they believed to be her attacker. He is seen walking in the Burley area of Leeds in a green Puma sweatshirt, dark jacket and jeans in the hours before the incident

Wearing a distinctive green Puma hooded jumper and jeans, the man was filmed near a Tesco Express three miles from where the Beeston bus stop where he attacked his victim between 9 and 10pm.

He is described as being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, in his early twenties and slim with a receding hairline. 

Detective Superintendent Nick Wallen of West Yorkshire Police urged members of the public to come forward if they recognised any details from the newly released footage. 

'These are the most detailed images yet of the man involved in this terrible crime and they paint a very clear picture of him,' he said. 

'We are urgently appealing for anyone who thinks they know who he is to contact us immediately.

'We are asking people to think very carefully about all these elements and put them together with the e-fit image we have released and the other CCTV footage showing his size, build and movements, particularly his distinctive walk that shows he possibly has a limp. 

West Yorkshire Police produced this computer generated image after taking a description of the suspect from his victim. He is described as of Pakistani or Middle Eastern background and in his early twenties

In a graphic CCTV sequence the man is seen dragging the woman from the bus stop and into a garden to rape her

Police released the chilling footage in a bid to track down the suspect who is wanted for attempted murder

The woman was waiting at this bus stop in the Beeston area of Leeds last Friday when she was targeted 

'I cannot stress enough how important it is that we trace and arrest this man at the very earliest opportunity.' 

His 18-year-old victim was left with serious head injuries and a broken hip after last week's attack. 

Earlier police released a video of the 'harrowing' moment she was dragged from the street into a garden to be raped. 

Alongside CCTV footage of the man, police have released photographs of the rock he used to beat her over the head. 

Investigators believe he may have brought the weapon with him in a premeditated assault. 

Speaking of the object, Det Supt Wallen said: 'It is quite distinctive as an object and we would ask people to let us know if they recognise it as something that has come from their garden or elsewhere, particularly if they live somewhere on his route towards the crime scene along Cemetery Road from the direction of Holbeck.

'The stone has been subject to extensive forensic examination and we are working with a specialist geologist to establish where it may have come from.'   

Police described the incident as both 'harrowing' and 'appalling' and are urging anyone with information to come forward
