For Freya and Graham McAnally, their wedding will always be an incredibly special day - not least because the Hollywood actress Meryl Streep was one of their surprise guests.

The couple were stunned when the Oscar-winning star put in an appearance as they tied the knot - dressed as Margaret Thatcher.

Freya and groom Graham were tying the
 knot at Manchester Town Hall on the same day as the actress was there 
filming scenes for the forthcoming biopic about Margaret Thatcher, The 
Iron Lady.

Special day: The couple had been warned that the crew would be filming in the town hall on their wedding day, but they didn't expect to see the actress and cast at Manchester Town Hall (pictured)

Freya, 31, said: 'It was all very 
surreal - Meryl Streep was standing there dressed as Margaret Thatcher. 
It almost feels like it didn't happen.

'I thought it was amazing, the last thing you expect is an A-List celebrity at your wedding.'

The
 cast and crew were in the town for two days filming due to its interior
 looking similar to the inside of the Houses of Parliament.

And when Freya made her entrance, 
walking up the stairs to the main entrance to meet Graham inside, other 
members of the cast and crew - including Jim Broadbent, who plays 
Thatcher's husband Denis, and Richard E Grant, cast as Michael Heseltine - applauded the bride.

The couple were even given a card 
from the cast, champagne, flowers, a glass vase and a copy of the film's
 call sheet for the day.

In addition, Streep also sent them 
two signed pictures with messages of congratulations - one before they 
got married and another while they were away on their honeymoon.

The couple, from Northenden, had been 
warned that filming was taking place on their wedding day, which 
happened in February this year.

Graham, 33, said he was initially 
worried that it might overshadow their wedding, but added: 'It turned 
out to be to our advantage as there were more lights around and the town
 hall had been given an extra clean for the filming.

'They went above and beyond what they had to - it was lovely.'

Freya added: 'We can't praise the town hall or the film cast and crew enough they completely respected our wedding.'
