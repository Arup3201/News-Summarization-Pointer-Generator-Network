Congress ignited outrage in Moscow on Thursday by voting to empower the U.S. to punish Russians implicated in human rights abuses. 

The Senate approved the measure, which has already passed the House of Representatives, in a sweeping 92-to-4 vote. 

As it was originally crafted, the legislation was meant to strengthen U.S. relations with Russia by finally lifting Cold War-era restrictions on trade relations. The restrictions were adopted in the 1970s as a means of punishing Communist countries. Without them, trade with Russia is expected to double.

Livid: The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs led by Sergey Lavrov (pictured) described a measure passed by Congress on Thursday as 'nothing but a vindictive desire to counter Russia in world affairs'

But Moscow is livid because the measure also includes a provision that would give U.S. officials the power to freeze the assets of Russians implicated in human rights abuses and to deny them visas. 

The provision is dubbed the 'Magnitsky Law' after Sergei L. Magnitsky, a lawyer who died in Russian custody in 2009 after alleging that government officials had conspired in a $230 million tax fraud scheme.

Twitter rage: 'It is perplexing and preposterous to hear human rights complaints from the US, where torture and kidnapping are legal in the 21st century,' the Ministry wrote in a series of furious remarks on its official Twitter feed

The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the provision Thursday as 'nothing but a vindictive desire to counter Russia in world affairs.'

'It is perplexing and preposterous to hear human rights complaints from the US, where torture and kidnapping are legal in the 21st century,' the Ministry wrote in a series of furious remarks on its official Twitter feed. 'Apparently, Washington has forgotten what year this is and still thinks the Cold War is going on.'

The Ministry said the U.S. has no right to weigh in on the Russian government's internal affairs.

'The US decision to impose visa and financial sanctions on certain Russian citizens is like something out of the theatre of the absurd,' the Ministry wrote. 'Obviously, US passage of the "Magnitsky Act" will adversely affect the prospects of bilateral cooperation.'

By contrast, Sen. John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, said Congress has every right to keep Moscow in check when it comes to human rights. 

'This culture of impunity in Russia has been growing worse and worse,' McCain said. 'There are still many people who look at the Magnitsky Act as anti-Russia. I disagree. I believe it is pro-Russia.'

'Ultimately passing this legislation will place the United States squarely on the side of the Russian people and the right side of Russian history, which appears to be approaching a crossroads.'

The measure now goes to President Obama, who will likely sign it, even though he believes the trade bill should be considered separately from the human rights provision.
