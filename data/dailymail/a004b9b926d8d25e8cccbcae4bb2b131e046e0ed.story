She has become known for her love of chic, pale hues and her outfit for today's coronation celebrations at Westminster Abbey proved no exception for the Duchess of Cornwall.

Camilla's stunning eau de nil silk suit and matching hat drew almost as many admiring glances as the Duchess of Cambridge's peach ensemble as she entered the Abbey with the Prince of Wales this morning.Â 

The Duchess was fresh from a successful visit to France - her first solo engagement - during which she charmed the locals by managing to make a mistake-free speech in French.

The Duchess and her husband were joined by other senior royals, including the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry for the service, as well as Prime Minister David Cameron and the leader of the opposition, Ed Milliband.

The Count and Countess of Wessex looked in good spirits as they arrived with their daughter, nine-year-old Lady Louise Windsor, and were joined by princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, both of whom looked glamorous in navy blue and teal dresses.

Other members of the royal family to attend the ceremony were Princess Anne, her son Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn, and her daughter Zara Phillips who arrived on the arm of her rugby player husband, Mike Tindall.

Also at Westminster Abbey was the Netherlands' newly crowned King, Willem-Alexander, and his wife, Queen Maxima.

Today's service commemorates the 60th anniversary of the Queen's coronation, which took place on the 2nd June, 1953.

Along with the service, the occasion was also marked with a 62-round cannon salute fired by members of the Honorable Royal Artillery yesterday.
