Just days after she was accused of faking a Nevada residency, the newly-crowned Miss America failed to name the state's capital during a radio show quiz.

Miss Nevada Nia Sanchez, who was crowned Miss USA on June 9, was accused of falsely claiming Nevada residency so that she could enter the state's pageant while continuing to live and work in California.

On June 16, Sanchez was participating in a quiz on The Todd Show when she was asked to name the capital of Nevada.

Tip of her tongue: Sanchez searched desperately for an answer but one of the hosts eventually jumped in and told her the capital of Nevada is Carson City

'Oh, um, ah, oh my gosh,' she hedged, clicking her fingers while she struggled to answer the question.

The host took pity on the beauty queen and told her the answer: Carson City.

'Thank
 you, I was going to say that! I was like, that one DJ host on MTV, back
 in the day, his name, that's how I always remembered it,' Sanchez said,
 but was also unable to name the host she was thinking of.

Someone supplied the answer, and she said, 'Carson Daly, that guy!'

Cheater? Newly-crowned Miss USA Nia Sanchez answered questions about her Nevada residency in an interview with Fox News

Sanchez won the coveted title competing as Miss Nevada, but some have claimed that she did not really live in Nevada, so shouldn't have been allowed into that state's pageant.

She has stated categorically that Nevada is her home and that she did not cheat her way to victory.

'Nothing 
could have been more thrilling for me than to have won the Miss USA 
title. I have lived in Nevada since the fall of 2012 and it was an honor
 for me to represent the state at Miss USA,' she said in a statement.

After three consecutive failed 
attempts to win the Miss California USA crown, in 2010, 2011 and 2012, 
Sanchez, 24, won the Miss Nevada competition in January.

However, unnamed sources have suggested that Sanchez only met the Nevada pageant's 
minimum residency requirements to compete for the crown, but she didn't 
actually live in the Silver State.

'She never actually moved to Nevada, but continued to work at Disney and live in California, setting up some minimum paper trail to appear like she was in Nevada and allow her to compete,' a 'well-placed' source told Fox News.

'Shanna Moakler is the Nevada director, and she personally coached Nia on what she needed to do to qualify in Nevada and skirt around the need to be actually from there.'

Not true: Sanchez says there's 'no truth' to the claims and that she has been living in Las Vegas, working as a model, for the past 18 months which is more than the six-month residency rule

Moakler won the Miss USA competition 
in 1995 and went on to become the director of the Nevada pageant in 2011.
 However, Sanchez says there's 'no truth' to the claim she received 
special treatment.

She says 
she competed in the pageant by the books, living in Nevada for more than 
18 months before signing up which is longer than the required six-month 
residency rule.

'[Las Vegas] is my home,' Sanchez said. 'I have a house there with a friend.'

The Miss Universe Organization told ABC News there is 'no reason to question her residency.'

'I actually had an agent that was working with me in Nevada a lot so I figured why not work in that state, and then I looked into the pageant program because I had done pageants before,' she explained.

'So I figured why not look into the one in Nevada? I really liked the way that it was run, the director that ran it, it seemed like a really healthy, well-run state program. So I decided to go there since I was living there anyway.'

According to her Miss USA application, Sanchez currently works for AC Model Agency which has branches in both Las Vegas and Los Angeles but her profile with the company lists her as living in California.

She defenends the profile, saying that's where all the lucrative modeling jobs are at but that most of her work is done in Las Vegas.

Before that, she worked at Disneyland as a princess and competed in the Miss California competition in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

Another source said California pagaent queens often cross the state line to compete in Nevada becamase 'it was easier there'.

In California, pagaent girls went up against 100-200 other women whereas there were only 33 in the pool for Nevada's competition.

Sanchez says it's just not true that the competition is eaiser in Nevada.

'At least this year in Nevada, we had such strong compeititon. All the girls were not only beautiful, they were smart, college-educated well-rounded women…. I think it was a really tough competition.'

However there are other pagaent insiders who think it's wrong to move to compete in a different state, even if the girls do it according to competition rules.

'Most women are really proud to represent their home state, and it starts to become unfair to the hometown contestants competing when this happens,' said Angie Meyer, a former PR representative for the Miss California pageant. 'If you can’t win at home, you have no business competing elsewhere.'
