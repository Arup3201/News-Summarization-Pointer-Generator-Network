Lindsey Vonn's tough week at the skiing world championships in Colorado continued as boyfriend Tiger Woods watched from the sideline.

Vonn, who broke down in tears after being disqualified from the Alpine combined race on Tuesday, was targeting her last chance of a medal in the giant slalom event on Thursday.

Vonn made several mistakes and wound up 2.67 seconds behind the leaders during the first run of the event.

Vonn, four-time world champion, has had a tough week on the slopes at the Skiing World Championships

Anna Fenninger of Austria has a comfortable lead after the first run of the event finishing in 1 minute, 8.98 seconds and holds a 0.81-second advantage over teammate Michaela Kirchgasser.

Sweden's Jessica Lindell-Vikarby trails by 0.90 seconds heading into the afternoon run. There are still lower-tier skiers competing, with 116 entrants in the field. 

Four-time wold champion Vonn made her competitive comeback to skiing at the beginning of the year having had to pull out of the Sochi Winter Olympics after suffering a potentially career-threatening knee injury in January 2014. 

Vonn equaled Austrian Annemarie Moser-Proell's 35-year-old record of 62 women's Alpine skiing World Cup victories when she won a downhill race in Cortina d'Ampezzo in January. 

Vonn will need a massive performance in the second run to stand any chance of securing a medal 

Woods recently announced he would be taking break from golf in a bid to overcome his latest injury scare and poor form.

The 14-time major champion withdrew midway through his first round at last week's Farmers Insurance Open in California due to back pain although he has allayed fears over the setback.

Of more pressing concern for the 39-year-old is his recent struggles on the course, with his injury coming six days after recording the worst round of his career - an 11-over-par 82 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open.
