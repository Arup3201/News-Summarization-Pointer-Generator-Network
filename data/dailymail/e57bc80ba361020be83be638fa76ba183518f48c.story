There are a million women who wouldn't mind swapping places with Sarah Greene. 

Unlike the rest of the nation's females, Aidan Turner's beautiful Irish girlfriend is lucky enough to enjoy the smouldering Poldark star for real.

The 29-year-old actress may not yet be a household name but she's also a long way off being just Turner's squeeze with a blossoming acting career of her own. They are very much a couple whose stars are in the ascendant.

A very aspiring couple: Poldark star Aidan Turner, 31, with his girlfriend, 29-year-old actress Sarah Greene

Behind every brooding man: The couple have been together for four years and have weathered working apart for their careers. They say Skype has helped...

And he is clearly smitten with his girlfriend of four years.

In an interview with the Sunday Times this weekend, the 31-year-old Irishman says that while many couples, particularly those in the limelight, might have seen their relationship foundering under the pressure of work commitments, they didn't have that problem.

'You meet someone, you fall in love, then you can only see them over Skype or phone calls or texts and emails. And you have this whole other side to your relationship and it's... it was fun. 

He continues: 'We knew we really wanted to be together. And knew if we could do that, we could tackle a lot more. It was never: God, this is hard, bloody hell, we need to review this. This sucks. We never questioned it; it was great. So we had that from the beginning...'

Early on in the couple's relationship, Greene painted a similar picture, previously admitting to the Irish Times that they are both resigned to periods apart: 'Well, that's the job we do. We'll always travel with work. Skype is great, and we're getting on brilliantly. 

'It's been actually quite easy because we're both working. If I wasn't working it would be a lot harder.' 

Irish eyes: Greene, who was born in Cork, starred opposite Daniel Radcliffe in The Cripple of Innishmaan and was nominated for both a Laurence Olivier award and a Tony Award for her performance

So, who exactly is Sarah Greene and how did she successfully woo the man that is currently capturing millions of hearts while playing Cornish legend Captain Ross Poldark in the hit BBC series?

To date, the Cork-born actress is best known for playing opposite Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe in The Cripple of Inishmaan.

Greene played the role of Helen McCormick in the play and trod the boards in the London production in 2013 before transferring to Broadway the following year. It was a role that garnered plenty of praise from critics; nominations for Laurance Olivier and Tony Awards followed.

The actress is currently starring in Penny Dreadful, a Dublin-based Sky Atlantic horror show about the cheap-to-buy, sensationalist books of the same name which were published in the 19th century. 

Masterpiece! Turner has admitted to using baby oil to make his body look perfect on screen

Although the Poldark star has said he had to seriously hit the gym to perfectly hone his physique, the make-up department had another trick to ensure his body looked suitably granite-like for the hit BBC show.

Turner says that some kind of 'baby oil' was used to make his muscles ripple perfectly for the camera.

And Captain Poldark's striking eyes might suggest Turners' own peepers were enhanced with make-up but that's not the case. 

He told the Times that while he had to wear eyeliner for 'some scenes', he definitely doesn't lush up his lashes with mascara. 

A role in the Canadian-Irish television series Vikings also raised the Irish beauty's profile and it seems Hollywood now beckons too. Later this year, the striking brunette is set to start work on a comedy, playing opposite Bradley Cooper and Sienna Miller.

Born in Cork, Greene trained in Dublin, graduating from the Gaiety School of Acting in 2006 after becoming obsessed with being an actress after going to watch a local panto. 

She said: 'My parents took myself and my sister to see the Christmas panto Red Riding Hood in the Cork Opera House and I was sold, all I wanted to do was get up on the stage!'

The couple met after working together in the play Titus Andronicus but it was a slow burn before a relationship developed. 

He told Irish Weekend Magazine in 2013: 'I did a play with her about eight years ago Titus Andronicus, directed by Selina Cartmell. 

'I played Demetrius, her character wasn't a named character but we met on that. 

'It was all very platonic and we never hooked up or anything, but that's how we got to know each other. 

And then years later we just met again and it just sort of took off.' 

His brooding good looks aren't always so refined either. The actor has confessed that he is 'inherently lazy' and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached.

'I worked hard for six weeks, killing myself in the gym, watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never, ever do all that if I wasn't prepping for a role. That's the only time it just happens,' he explained.

'I'm not like that now. I'm back to my usual soft self.' 

It hasn't always been plain sailing on the love front either. Speaking to the Daily Mirror about being hurt by a past girlfriend, the actor said: 'Yes, it's happened to me. I've been upset, my heart's been broken.

'I don't know anyone on the planet who hasn't had their heart broken. Love is love.

'It's the purest and rawest thing we have in life and everyone experiences it.'

He may have found happiness with Greene, but talks of engagement are too hasty. Last week, she told Irish entertainment websites and Goss.ie and Evoke.ie while at an event in Dublin: 'I'm not engaged.'
