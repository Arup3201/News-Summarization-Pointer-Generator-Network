Experts have determined the disease that has brought Florida orange production to its lowest levels in 30 years and led to a massive price spike throughout the country.

A gnat-sized bug called the Asian citrus psyllid is believed to be the insect spreading the deadly bacteria that has cut the state's production dramatically.

The gnat is not the only problem facing the plants, as citrus greening disease and an unexpectedly harsh winter posed their own problems for the crop.

Lower production: A combination of a new strand of bacteria, a brutally cold winter and other standard threats have led the Department of Agriculture to set lower production targets for Florida's orange crop in coming years

Farmers don't know what to do to fix the issue, as they have kept on check with insecticide and mineral treatments in the soil.

Harder work: Farmers are trying their best to fight off the bacteria by being diligent with their use of insecticide but that isn't enough

'We spray at least every four weeks... but we are not keeping pace with the spread,' said Ellis Hunt, a family farmer whose 5,000 acres near Lake Wales have been struck by the spreading disease.

'It feels we are losing the fight,' he told the AFP.

As a result, American orange juice prices hit two-year highs last week after a government crop report trimmed last month's forecasts for production and yield from Florida.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture cut its latest estimates for Florida's orange output and yield in a report issued after one of the most brutal winters in decades.

Florida's orange output for 2013/14 had been reduced to 110 million boxes from a previous forecast of 114 boxes in March, the USDA said.

'The Florida all orange forecast, at 110 million boxes (4.95 million tons), is down 4 percent from the previous forecast and down 18 per cent from last season's final utilization,' it said.

Yields for frozen concentrated orange juice were revised to an estimated 1.6 gallons a box, from last month's forecast of 1.61 gallons.

The yields were 'down 1 per cent from the March forecast but up 1 per cent from last season's final yield of 1.59 gallons per box,' it added.

Backlash: As a result of lower production, American orange juice prices hit two-year highs last week

Adding to farmer's problems is the fact that orange juice consumption has dropped by 30 per cent since 2003 as a result of the growing number of drink options available and the growing tendancy to skip breakfast.

'Juice is often associated with breakfast and as our society changes, we rush ourselves a little bit and we have a tendency to skip it,' said Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services official Daniel Sleep.
