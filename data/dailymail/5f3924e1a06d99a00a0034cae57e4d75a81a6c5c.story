They've tested gourmet burgers and table service and even tried to bust the myths behind their food production.

Now, McDonald's has turned to the trend of pop-up restaurants to try and sell their latest products. 

The fast food chain launched its latest promotion the Big Lunchbox on Wednesday, which will see an enormous lunchbox transform into a pop-up store and travel the country.

McDonald's is using the demonstration as a means to promote their new menu which includes rump steak that they claim is '100% Aussie rump steak that has been marinated, slow cooked and finished off on the grill'.

A McDonald's spokesman said customer feedback about their new menus has been positive. 

'Customer feedback on our new Create Your Taste range, and our table service has been fantastic,' he said.

But is it enough to keep the restaurant chain on top of the fast food market?

McDonald's launched it's travelling pop-up store in Melbourne's Federation square on Wednesday

The global net income of the major food supplier has recorded a  profit drop of 30 per cent in the last quarter ending September 30.

The company saw its total net income fall to $1.07 billion or $1.09 per share.

As competition against other fast-food suppliers rises, and a food scandal in China damaging the company's reputation in Asia, McDonald's has tried to redeem themselves through a number of campaigns that promote it as a healthy, classy option. 

Rob Moodie, a professor of public health at the University of Melbourne told Daily Mail Australia that he believes this continues to remain far from the truth.

McDonald's claims the ingredient is made of '100% Aussie rump steak that has been marinated, slow cooked and finished off on the grill'

'One would hope these changes are because we as consumers are more discerning and demanding of healthy food, because that's the only way that we would ever receive a change in McDonald's rather than through government regulation,' Professor Mooide said.

'They are the masters of marketing, they don't come much better than Ronald McDonald for instance – he's the 21st century pied piper.

'They've been claiming for the last five to 10 years that they're part of the solution to the overweight issue, not the problem, but I'm yet to be convinced that they are. I have watched them closely for the last 10 years: their job is making money and they'll make money in any way they can – their job is not health.'

The pop-up store is one of many recent attempts by the fast food company to boost their reputation following a huge drop in profits 

The global net income of the major food supplier dropped by 30 per cent in the last quarter ending September 30. The company saw its total net income fall to $1.07 billion or $1.09 per share

Last week the restaurant launched a social media campaign called 'Our food. Your questions' in which the company answered questions from consumers like: 'Is pink slime in a Chicken McNugget?' and 'Why doesn't your food rot?'

Although it provided a short-term lift in quality perception and purchase consideration, the company's key demographic of frequent fast-food eaters were largely unmoved by the campaigns, YouGov spokesman Drew Kerr told Reuters.

McDonald's pop-up restaurant, which is giving away a range of free wraps and salads that include rump beef, has started its tour in Melbourne's federation square and will continue on to the Gold Coast, Sydney and Adelaide for three days at a time.
