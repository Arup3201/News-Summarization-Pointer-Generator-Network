Innocent bystander? Annette Bongiorno leaves federal court in New York on Monday after testifying she had no idea what most of the crimes attributed to Madoff were

Bernie Madoff's former secretary, one of the five Madoff workers on trial for abetting his fraud, says she did not understand any financial terms despite spending 40 years working for him at his office.

Annette Bongiorno, 65, on trial in federal court in Manhattan, said she did not understand terms like Ponzi scheme, treasury bond, the Standard & Poor’s 500 index or events like the collapse of Lehman Brothers, despite being a key employee at the investment firm.

Bongiorno is one of five former Madoff workers on trial in the case of the fraud attempt, which fell apart in December 2008, costing investors an estimated $17 billion in losses.

When questioned about her alleged role in concealing Madoff's multibillion-dollar fraud, Bongiorno did not deny that she entered thousands of backdated trades in customers' accounts, sometimes years after they had purportedly occurred.

But she said, again and again, that she was simply following Madoff's orders, knew next to nothing about Wall Street and had ‘no clue’ that anything she had done was illegal.

She said: ‘All the trades were backdated... I did what I was told.'

Also on trial are former director of 
operations Daniel Bonventre, portfolio manager Joann Crupi and computer 
programmers Jerome O'Hara and George Perez.

'I loved Bernie': Bongiorno is one of five former Madoff employees on trial for allegedly playing a part in his vast Ponzi scheme. While testifying on her own behalf Monday the 65-year-old took the opportunity to heap praise on her former boss and said she once even called him her hero

Bonventre
 and Bongiorno have taken the witness stand in their own defense, 
hoping  that the jury will accept claims that they were duped by Madoff 
into believing the business was legitimate.

Ringleader: According to Bongiorno, Madoff was the mastermind behind the Ponzi scheme, and she claims that despite being his assistant, she had no idea what most of the financial terms were and was simply 'following orders'

All
 five defendants have said they were unaware that Madoff, who pleaded 
guilty and is serving a 150-year prison sentence, was running a Ponzi 
scheme.

During her 
testimony, Bongiorno said she believed Madoff was trading stock in bulk 
and then deciding later how to divvy up the transactions among his 
customers, something she thought was legal.

Assistant
 U.S. Attorney John Zach showed Bongiorno documents on which she had 
plotted out backdated trades to enter into customer accounts, though no 
trading actually happened.

Zach asked: ‘You were the one who wrote all these trades in?

‘And your testimony is that for every single one of these trades, Mr. Madoff told you what to do?’

Bongiorno answered yes to both questions.

Bongiorno said that when Madoff was arrested, she had to ask another employee what a Ponzi scheme was.

In
 addition, when she came under questioning from Zach about finances and 
trading, she said she couldn't explain the difference between a stock 
and a bond.

Zach showed 
Bongiorno documents showing that sales of Lehman Brothers stock were 
entered into her account in October 2008, a month after the investment 
bank collapsed, but were backdated to August.

Fellow defendant: Daniel Bonventre was Madoff's former back-office director and is on trial alongside Bongiorno, charged with profiting from the massive $65 billion Ponzi scheme. All five have pleaded not guilty

Zach asked: ‘Do you remember what happened to Lehman Brothers in September 2008?’

‘No, but I guess you're going to tell me,’ she said.

Zach
 then showed Bongiorno several front-page newspaper articles from that 
month about the financial crisis and questioned her about the timing of 
the backdated trades.

‘That didn't raise a red flag for you?’ he asked.

‘If I was told to do it, I did it,’ she said.

Bongiorno
 allegedly used proceeds from the fraud to finance a luxurious 
lifestyle, showing the jury photographs of her Bentley sedan and the 
high-end condominium in Boca Raton, Florida, where she planned to 
purchase a $6.5 million home.

The trial, which began more than four months ago, will resume on Monday and is expected to end in March.

PONZI SCHEME

Named after Charles Ponzi, who adapted a technique in 1920 from the Charles Dickens novel 'Martin Chuzzlewit', the scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from existing or new funds that have been paid by investors, rather than profit earned from the running of the organisation.

Returns are short term and abnormally high, and require a consistent flow of funds from new investors to sustain the scheme. Money travels up, making the person at the top richer, while the people at the bottom simply get their investment back.

TREASURY BOND

In interest bearing bond issued by the U.S. treasury, which repays periodic interest payments as well as repaying the value of the bond originally paid, in U.S. currency.

STANDARD & POOR 500

The S&P 500 is a stock market index based on the market capitalisations of 500 large companies having common stock on the New York Stock Exchange.

The parts of the S&P 500 are determined by S&P Dow Jones Indices.

It is one of the most commonly followed equity lists.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A STOCK AND A BOND

Stocks are shares of a company, or a type of security that gives ownership in a corporation, and of a part of its profits. They are also known as 'equity'.

A bond is a debt investment where the investor loans money to a company or government, that borrows the funds for a defined period of time at a specified interest rate.
