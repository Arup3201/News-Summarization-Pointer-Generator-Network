A jilted husband has been jailed for almost a year and given a restraining order after rampaging through his former marital home with a chainsaw to reduce its value.

These photographs show how Andrew Brooks, 43, destroyed large parts of the property after the £150,000 Lake District cottage was put in the name of his estranged wife Bridget. 

He took the chainsaw to the majority of external and internal doors, reminiscent of terrifying scenes from Stanley Kubrick's film The Shining where star Jack Nicholson hacks through them with an axe.

The former soldier had sawn through the property's doors to enter his former home in Marton, near Barrow-in-Furness after a dispute over ownership of the property when his wife left him because he was abusive.  

Although she was not in the home at the time, Brooks' rampage left Mrs Brooks suffering panic attacks and on prescribed medication because she has been so anxious he might turn up again.

On the rampage: Andrew Brooks, 43, has been jailed after he destroyed large parts of a  £150,000 Lake District cottage with a chainsaw after his wife Bridget left him

Kitchen: Brooks began slicing at everything he could see with the aim of reducing the value of the house after it was handed to his wife

Lounge: The father-of-two hacked at two log burners in the house in his trail of destruction last year, which has left him in prison

Revenge: Despite being to blame for the breakdown of their marriage Brooks decided to continue to abuse his wife by destroying their home when it was put in her name

After the house was put in his wife's name he went berserk and chopped it up with a chainsaw.

The father-of-two had been desperate for revenge and wanted to knock thousands off the value of the rural property after the collapse of the couple's 14-year marriage.

During his £9,000 rampage, Brooks damaged the front and rear external doors to the property, three internal doors and an internal beam, two woodburning stoves, several cupboards and a fireplace. 

At Preston Crown Court, Brooks, now of Eccles, Greater Manchester pleaded guilty to criminal damage and was jailed for 46 weeks.

These pictures of the aftermath of the rampage were shown to Judge Jacqueline Beech, who sent him to prison.

She told him: 'This was an act of revenge or retribution against your former wife who had the courage to leave the abusive relationship she was in with you'. 

During the course of that relationship you were physically and emotionally abusive to her and you made her life a misery. 

Entry: After his ex-wife changed the locks Brooks cut his way in to the cottage through this door by slashing a hole in its bottom panel

Deliberate act: The former soldier had slashed through the majority of the house's doors before the police arrived after neighbours saw him wandering around with a chainsaw

Abuse: Brooks also drove the chainsaw through several cupboards in the house as part of a revenge attack on his ex-wife Bridget

The judge said: 'You were aggrieved about the separation and the sale of the house and equity. You wanted to reduce the value and prospective of a sale by causing damage to it. She has suffered anxiety, panic attacks since the separation from you and has been prescribed medication and has anxiety because by the uncertainty of when you might turn up.'

She said reports alleged Brooks had shown 'no remorse' and that he 'continued to blame his wife for the current circumstances'. She added: 'This was a pre-planned offence involving you taking a chainsaw to your former matrimonial home to wreak revenge upon your wife. It was part of the continuing course of conduct whilst there was a restraining order.

'The circumstances of this offence and value of damage caused, means an immediate prison sentence is inevitable. Your conduct was towards the mother of your children.'

Earlier the court heard the couple split up in September 2011 and in May 2014 at the matrimonial court, an order was made transferring ownership of the property to Mrs Brooks' name. 

But Mrs Brooks was said to have had concerns that her former husband would take steps to reduce the value of the property, which was at the time vacant, in revenge for her being awarded the house.

As a result the locks on the door were changed and the keys were deposited at the police station so that entry could only be gained by going to the station. 

The house insurance was also increased by Mrs Brooks.

Days later Brooks was seen by a neighbour at the rear of his former address walking around the garden with the chainsaw. 

He was seen taking the chainsaw in order to remove the panel of the PVC door. He was to say that he had lost his keys and did not want to change the locks before using the chainsaw to gain access into the property.

Attack: Brooks damaged the front and rear external doors to the property, pictured, three internal doors, two woodburning stoves, several cupboards and a fireplace

Flagrant: Brooks even took his chainsaw to the the beams of the pretty Lake District cottage after becoming bitter about the break-up

Indiscriminate: The former soldier took the chainsaw to the majority of external and internal doors, reminiscent of terrifying scenes from Stanley Kubrick's film The Shining where star Jack Nicholson hacks through them with an axe.

Brooks had been previously handed a restraining order in September 2012 following two offences of harassment and then two further charges of harassment where he received a community order. The court was told that he had been residing in Manchester with his new partner and his eldest son who he was tutoring in the run up to his GCSEs.

It is believed his younger son lives with his mother. In mitigation, Mr Alexander Langhorn asked for his sentence to be suspended and for him to be credited for his early plea. He said that upon leaving school at 16 Brooks had worked in a number of fields including mechanics before joining the Armed Forces serving with a distinction in a number of areas throughout the world.

But upon the birth of his second son he left and had worked as a landscape gardener. He added that his client had been 'a positive role model'.

Mr Langhorn said: 'He had been very much part of his children's lives and wanted to do the best for them. He knows he has put them at risk. He has been tutoring his son throughout the year, he knows that anything he does now, any sentence he faces, the impact is not only on him but also on his family. It places a double weight.'

He added that he was 'a hard worker and provider' and that he had been involved in the community based Dalton Carnival. 'He is a man who goes out of his way to help others.' Brooks must also pay a victim surcharge of £100. The restraining order will run until further notice.
