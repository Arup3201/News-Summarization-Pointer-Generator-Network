Diseased and dirty meat could end up on Britain's dinner plates as a result of new EU legislation, a union has warned.

British food inspectors reject millions of carcasses carrying parasites and infections from the food chain every year.

But Unison, which represents government meat inspectors and official vets, has claimed proposed changes to food legislation by Brussels will water down their ability to check the quality and throw out sub-standard meat.

More than two million instances of tapeworm (pictured) were discovered in red meat by the Food Standards Agency between 2012 and 2014

The changes come just a year after the horsemeat scandal, in which food advertised as beef was found to contain horse meat.

Statistics collected by the Food Standards Agency between 2012 and 2014 recorded more than two million instances of tapeworm being discovered in red meat. Inspectors also rejected more than 560,000 cases of milk spot - caused by parasitic roundworm larvae - in pigs.

During that period, they also rejected nearly three million chickens that had been contaminated with faeces during slaughter - which causes the most common form of human food poisoning in the UK.

But the European Commission has argued it needs to shake up current food legislation.

There are fears the new rules could see contaminated meat find its way onto British dinner tables

It is now reducing 70 pieces of detailed regulation into a more simplified framework that will 'reduce the burden on business' and 'improve consumer protection'.

Rules on inspections of pig carcasses have already been changed. Officials have until now cut into pig heads to check that the animals were not carrying hidden disease and abscesses, but new regulations from June replace it with a visual inspection.

Currently, all chicken carcasses are checked after slaughter by official inspectors or vets in factories, but the European Food Safety Authority has recommended this requirement be abolished.

Unison has accused the UK government of lobbying Brussels for deregulation in order to reduce industry costs.

A spokesman for Unison told The Guardian: 'The UK governmentâ€™s agenda will result in food that repulses us being dished up on our plates.

'Most people do not know that there are a small group of meat inspectors and vets that keep them safe from harmful and repulsive additions to our sausages, Sunday roasts and beef pies.

'They work in some of the most awful conditions in blood and animal discharges every day. They are always the first to come under attack, not only from the food business operators, but also from our government.'

The Food Standards Agency has defended the proposals, arguing that factories would still have to produce meat that was fit for human consumption.
