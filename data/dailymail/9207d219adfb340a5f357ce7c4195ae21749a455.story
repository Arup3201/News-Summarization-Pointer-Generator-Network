Theresa May will today unveil a major shake-up of Britain’s lopsided extradition laws.

In a victory for the Mail’s Affront to British Justice campaign, the Home Secretary will introduce rules making it more likely a UK citizen will face trial at home rather than being bundled on a plane to the US.

The implementation of the so-called ‘forum’ bar – so a court hearing has to be held to decide where a person should stand trial – satisfies one of the most vocal demands of campaigners appalled by Labour’s unfair Extradition Act.

Plans: Home Secretary Theresa May will introduce rules making it more likely a UK citizen will face trial at home rather than being bundled on a plane to the US

Civil liberties groups argue it could have prevented the saga of Asperger’s sufferer Gary McKinnon who faces being packed off to America for alleged crimes which took place from the UK.

He hacked into US military computers from the bedroom of his north London home while looking for evidence of ‘little green men’.

Mrs May has sanctioned the introduction of the ‘forum’ despite the move being fiercely resisted by the US government.

A review of extradition laws by Sir Scott Baker – dubbed a ‘whitewash’ by critics – also ruled against changing the status quo. But Mrs May has decided the change is vital to restore public trust in Britain’s extradition arrangements.

It will be announced in a statement to MPs today.

At the same time, Mrs May will give her ruling on whether Mr McKinnon’s extradition to the US can be halted on medical grounds.

The decision will be based on a psychiatric report prepared for Mrs May by Professor Declan Murphy and Professor Thomas Fahy.

The study confirms there is a ‘significant’ risk of suicide which will increase if he is forced to travel to the US. The doctors say they ‘cannot offer reassurance that Mr McKinnon would not attempt to, or be successful in, harming or killing himself if he is arrested or extradited’.

Mrs May halted Mr McKinnon’s extradition as soon as the Coalition came to power. The Government has been studying different medical reports ever since.

The verdict could have significant political ramifications.

'Britain
was sold a pup in 2003. It’s time for this government to right the 
wrongs. Gary’s ten years spent living on a knife-edge has been nothing 
short of cruel and unnecessary punishment'

Prime Minister David Cameron, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and Attorney General Dominic Grieve all made specific statements in support of Mr McKinnon in Opposition.

They supported the Mail’s campaign calling for Gary and those like him to stand trial in the UK if their alleged crimes took place here.

The change in the rules on forum cannot be applied retrospectively to help the 46-year-old. However, it will be warmly welcomed by campaign groups, Tory and Liberal Democrat MPs.

In December, Parliament passed a unanimous vote demanding the introduction of forum. Campaigners believe it will eradicate much of the bias contained in the Extradition Act, which was passed by Labour in 2003.

They point to the fact not a single US citizen has been sent to Britain for a crime committed on American soil.

Waiting: The student Richard O'Dwyer - who is accused of copyright offences - also faces extradition to the US

By contrast, Mr McKinnon and the student Richard O’Dwyer – who is accused of copyright offences – are being dragged in the opposite direction for offences which allegedly took place here.

Christopher Tappin, a  retired golf club president from Surrey, is already in America awaiting trial on arms sale charges which he fiercely denies.

Forum, which will require a change to the law, means a hearing will take place in open court to decide where a person should go on trial.

Prosecutors will have to justify any attempt to send a suspect to the US for an alleged crime which took place here. The final decision will rest with a judge.

Currently, British prosecutors decide in private if they think the case should be tried here.

Melanie Riley of campaign group Friends-Extradited said: ‘Britain was sold a pup in 2003. It’s time for this government to right the wrongs. Gary’s ten years spent living on a knife-edge has been nothing short of cruel and unnecessary punishment.’

Earlier this year, the home affairs select committee said the UK/US extradition treaty was ‘unbalanced’ and must be urgently reformed. They called for suspects to be tried in the country where their crimes were allegedly committed unless there are exceptional reasons not to do so.

To extradite a UK citizen, the US needs only to outline the alleged offence, the punishment specified by statute and provide an accurate description of the suspect sought.
