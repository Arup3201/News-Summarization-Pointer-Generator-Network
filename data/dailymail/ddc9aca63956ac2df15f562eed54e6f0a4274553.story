Retired Germany keeper Tim Wiese is set to make his debut with the WWE on Saturday in Frankfurt as the 32-year-old pursues his goal to become a  professional wrestler.

Wiese, who's taken up body building since being released by the Bundesliga's Hoffenheim in January, has caught the eye of the sport and entertainment hybrid's top brass.

And Bild reports the six times-capped international will be introduced to wrestling fans at the WWE Live event this weekend at the Festhalle Frankfurt.

While the German paper says no contract has been signed between Wiese and the WWE and he won't be taking the ring in anger. Instead, his celebrity in his homeland will be used as a 'taster act' between bouts.

Wiese cuts an imposing figure with his 6ft 3in frame now boasting the muscle mass to more than match the likes of current superstars John Cena and Brock Lesner.

‘I got an official request from the WWE,' he told Bild in September.

‘It’s for a commitment from me to become a pro wrestler. I’ll listen to everything on it’s own merits.

‘Why should I say no? Wrestling is very popular especially in the United States. I will discuss the offer in the next few weeks with my agent. I am not scared.’

Wiese played just 10 times for Hoffenheim between 2012-2014 before being released in January

Before Wiese could join the upper echelons of the WWE, it's been said he would need a year's training to get up to speed with their risky manouvres and showmanship.

Wiese spent the majority of his football career at Werder Bremen (194 appearances), where he played in the Champions League, after stints at Fortuna Koln and Kaiserslautern, and was part of Germany's 2010 World Cup squad.

He played just 10 times for Hoffenheim between 2012 and 2014.
