After being on the market for almost a year, Al Capone's former mansion on Palm Island, Florida has finally sold.

The home went on the market last July with a $9.95million asking price, but was recently sold for $7.43million.

No word yet on who purchased the home.

Sold: Al Capone's former mansion was recently sold for $7.43million

Final home: The Palm Island estate was Capone's last home, and where he died in 1947

Peter Corsell, founder of energy solutions conglomerate Grid Point, was the previous owner and bought the house as a fixer-upper for $5.56million, then put it back on the market a year later.

Capone himself bought the home for $40,000 in 1928 from Clarence Busch of the Anheuser-Busch family. Of course, he paid in cold, hard cash.

The Mediterranean revival compound sits on waterfront property the size of a football field on Biscayne Bay.

'Two Versace South Beach villas could fit on this property,' broker Jorge Alonso told the New York Daily News. 'You step up to this huge pool. It's so glamorous.'

The size of the property was originally worrisome for the sellers since a buyer could knock down the building to take advantage of the large lot.

'We hope that doesn't happen. It's such an important piece of Americana,' Alonso said.

Massive: The 1928 home is located on a lot the size of a football field, right on the waterfront of Biscayne Bay

A steal: Capone bought the home with $40,000 cash from a member of the Anheuser-Busch family

Fixer-upper: The home's previous owner, Peter Corsell, bought the home to restore it and put it back on the market a year later

American treasure: Originally, the sellers were worried someone would purchase the home to tear it down and make use of the massive waterfront property

After purchasing the property, Corsell went about updating the mansion to it's original gangster grandeur.

Features of the seven-bedroom property include a two-story cabana pool house, a private dock, a front gatehouse built by Capone for his guards, and an Art Deco powder room. And in case the new owners are paranoid, the whole property is encircled by a tall masonry wall.

Party house: Capone used the home to hold wild Prohibition-era fetes

Room for friends: The house has seven bedrooms as well as detached guest houses

Security: Capone himself added on a front gatehouse especially for his guards

Restored: One of the house's powder rooms is still in it's original Art Deco style

Haunting: Capone died in one of the upstairs bedrooms, but the broker insists that it is not at all creepy

Safe: The house is encircled by a tall masonry wall, perhaps, to keep rival gangsters at bay

Paranoid: Capone would sleep in the front room of the house so he could be aware of everyone coming and going

Al Capone, the notorious Prohibition-era gangster is probably most well known for planning the 1929 Saint Valentine's Day Massacre - which resulted in the murder of seven mobsters in Chicago.

The Palm Island home is supposedly where he planned the massacre, and his alibi - since he was at the Florida home when the incident happened.

Though Capone was eventually arrested and imprisoned on a nearly decade-long sentence, he held onto the property.

When he was released from Alcatraz in 1939, he returned to the Palm Island home and spent the rest of his years there.

Planning site: The home is where Capone supposedly planned the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929

Final years: Capone returned to the home after being released from Alcatraz in 1939 and stayed there until his death in 1947

Capone died in the home in 1947, suffering the last years of his life from syphilis. The disease degraded his mind to that of a child's and apparently he slept in the front room, paranoid about who was coming and going from the house.

According to Alonso, Capone died in a room on the upstairs of the home, but it's not at all spooky.

'It used to be creepy, but after the renovation it's this charming little room. Everyone loves it up there.'
