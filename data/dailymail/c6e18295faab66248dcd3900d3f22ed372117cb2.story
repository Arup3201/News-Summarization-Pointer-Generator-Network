An incident in Persian Gulf on Tuesday saw the U.S. Coast Guard fire a warning at an Iranian fishing boat, after the small vessel allegedly prepared to fire a machine gun at the American crew.

According the Navy, the Coast Guard patrol vessel Monomoy was in international waters when it dispatched a team to conduct a routine query with the Iranian dhow, who initially identified themselves but then broke contact.

The team boarded a smaller boat as they moved closer to the dhow, observed it was armed with two .50-caliber machine guns.

One the guns was manned during the approach, Cmdr. Kevin Stephens, U.S. 5th Fleet spokesman, told Stars and Stripes.

'Self defense': The US Coast Guard  patrol boat Monomoy - stationed in the Persian Gulf - was conducting a routine query on an Iranian dhow boat when the crew charged a machine gun at them, the Navy said Tuesday

Armed: The Navy said that, upon approaching the dhow, the US small boat crew noticed two .50 caliber machine guns (similar to the one pictured), one of which was manned and allegedly preparing to fire

As the dhow's gunner charged the weapon, the American crew turned away, firing one warning shot, Stephens said.

'This action by the dhow's crew demonstrated hostile intent, which resulted in the defensive fire by the Coast Guardsmen,' Stephens said.

The Coast Guard acted in self defense, he said.

Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby told CNN there was no indication that the dhow was struck by the shot.

The dhow then left the scene without incident and without communicating further with the Monomoy.

No U.S. personnel were harmed, the Navy said.

The Coast Guard is in the gulf operating with the Navy's Fifth Fleet in the Persian Gulf.

On guard: The Monomoy is stationed in the Persian Gulf tasked with enforcing international law. They have the authority to board suspicious vessels

Coast Guard patrol boats have performed maritime security operations in the Gulf since 2003 and can board suspicious vessels.

They are stationed in the area to enforce international law, according to The Washington Post.

In 2012 rescued six fishermen after their dhow flooded.
