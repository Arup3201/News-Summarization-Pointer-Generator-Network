Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond has been accused of playing politics with today's Royal baby announcement.

The SNP leader used the official Scottish titles of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in a message welcoming the news this morning. He wrote: 'Congratulations & best wishes to the Earl & Countess of Strathearn. Wonderful to hear they're expecting their second baby – very happy news!'

Mr Salmond's intervention, just 10 days before the Scottish independence referendum, comes amid mounting mounting concern in Buckingham Palace about the prospect of a ‘yes’ vote.

The future of the Royal family has been a source of debate in the independence campaign, but the 'Yes' camp have insisted that the Queen will remain head of state in a future independent Scotland.

But one Labour MP today suggested Mr Salmond had used the Royal couple's official Scottish titles to ram home the point that the monarchy would still be in place after independence.

Hollywood star Alan Cumming has urged Scots to seize the ‘wonderful opportunity’ to leave the UK – even though he lives in the US and cannot vote.

The X-Men actor returned to Scotland to join Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon  making a final push for votes ahead of September 18.

Amid criticism that he will not have to face the consequences of a ‘No’ vote, Mr Cumming said: ‘It kind of gets my goat when people say that.

‘Nobody says why can’t David Cameron or Ed Miliband have a say, they’re not able to vote either.’

He added: ‘I feel so passionate about this. My brother said yesterday, he lives in Southampton, in England, so he doesn’t have a vote either, he said ‘it doesn’t matter that I don’t live in Scotland, Scotland lives inside of me.' 

Thomas Docherty, MP for Dunfermline and West Fife, said: ‘This is fantastic news for the Royal family and for everybody in the country and should not be politicised in any way.

‘Alex Salmond is absolutely shameless in his determination to shoehorn his obsession with independence into everything and anything.’

The future of the Royal family in an independent Scotland has been thrown into doubt in recent days amid claims that the Queen is concerned about future conflicts of interest.

Pollsters today claimed that the Royal baby announcement could help tip support back in favour of the union.

A spokesman for ComRes told MailOnline: ‘The Queen is generally very popular in the UK and so are the young royals like the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, probably more so than Prince Charles for example.

‘The royal family has not really played a part in the referendum debate until now but the Queen’s reported concerns and now Kate’s pregnancy will bring that into focus.

‘There are a number of reasons why the poll could swing back to no. It won’t be just because of the baby, but that and other issues about the royal family could influence the result’.

But a poll in The Times found more ‘yes’ voters now want to ditch the Queen as head of state of an independent Scotland than want to keep her in place, according to a new poll.

The YouGov poll found that 46 per cent of supporters of separation now believe that an independent Scotland should break its links with the UK royal family.

A total of 40 per cent believe an independent Scotland should keep the Queen, with 14 per cent undecided.

Among ‘no’ voters, the results are very different. More than two thirds of ‘no’ voters – 69 per cent – believe that an independent Scotland should keep the Queen, with just 18 per cent in favour of a Scottish republic and 13 per cent undecided.

When the Duchess first became pregnant in December 2012 the SNP leader Mr Salmond was quick to offer his ‘warmest congratulations’ - but again used the official Scottish titles.

Mr Salmond added: ‘Everyone in Scotland will join me in wishing the couple the very best as they prepare for the birth of their first child.’

Labour leader Ed Miliband sent his regards on Twitter this morning

The Prime Minister today responded to the news on Twitter. He said: ‘Many congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. I'm delighted by the happy news that they're expecting another baby.’

After the Duchess first fell pregnant Mr Cameron said she and Prince William would make ‘absolutely brilliant parents’.

Mr Cameron confirmed he was informed of the news shortly before the public announcement.

He added: ‘I got a little note coming into a meeting I was having and I found it quite difficult to keep it to myself.’

The following year, in 2013, Mr Cameron revealed how the entire Cabinet was sent into a panic thinking that the royal baby had arrived during a meeting at Chequers.

But the piece of paper rushed into a meeting was not an update from the palace but the latest from Lord's cricket ground.

The Prime Minister had instructed officials to keep him informed of the score from the Ashes match between England and Australia.

He said: ‘We had a Cabinet meeting and I asked someone to bring in the cricket score half way through just to see how it was going.

‘And a bit of paper arrived in the Cabinet room and everyone of course thought it was an announcement about the royal baby.

‘There was a great intake of breath and actually it was because Ken Clarke wanted to know what the score was because he was meant to be at Lord’s.’

In 2010 when it was announced that William and Kate were to marry Mr Cameron revealed that he had received the news in a call from Buckingham Palace during a cabinet meeting, and it was greeted with ‘a great cheer’ and ‘banging of the table’ from fellow ministers.
