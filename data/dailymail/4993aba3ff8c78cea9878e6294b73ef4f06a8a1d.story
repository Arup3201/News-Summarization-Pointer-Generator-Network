A country in as much of a financial meltdown as Greece could do worse than ask new national team manager Claudio Ranieri to give its government a hand balancing the books.

Ranieri has been appointed the new manager of Greece as they turn to the former Chelsea boss to lead the team into a new era. 

Once thing is for certain, whatever the highs and lows of his football career, the crafty Italian rarely finishes out of pocket.

Sacked by Chelsea in 2004, the 62-year-old has, by conservative estimates, banked a cool £10million in compensation pay-offs from four clubs in 10 years.

When Ranieri was given his marching orders by Roman Abramovich in 2004, he still had three years on a deal at Stamford Bridge which should have earned £2m-a-year in salary payments.

He stood accused of over-rotating his squad, and picked up the nickname of the ‘Tinkerman’, but his period in charge saw Chelsea finish second in the Premier League and reach the semi-finals of the Champions League.

It was not enough for Abramovich, who was ready to pay handsomely to get rid of Ranieri for what he considered failure. But Chelsea’s scheduled compensation bill was drastically cut to around £1m when their former boss walked into a new job replacing Liverpool-bound Rafa Benitez at Valencia.

Within eight months of taking charge of the Spanish champions, he was on the look out for a new job yet again and about to bank another hefty bonus for winning nothing.

The decision to axe Ranieri, taken at a panicked board meeting following the club's shock elimination from the UEFA Cup by Steaua Bucharest, was a costly one. 

He walked away with a cheque believed to be worth more than £4m, which allowed the luxury of two years off before taking his next job.

His self-imposed period in the wilderness ended with his return to management at Parma, who, against the odds, he led to Serie A safety at the end of the 2006-07 season.

After being at the club less than five months, though, he resigned to take over one of the biggest jobs in world football at Juventus.

His first season in charge was relatively successful, guiding them to third place a year after they had been rocked by the Italian match-fixing scandal.

But his second campaign was dire, leading to his dismissal after an emergency board meeting despite having a year to run on his original three-year contract.

Ranieri was due to receive his final year’s salary in one lump sum because a clause in the contract covered such an eventuality.

When his legal team threatened court action in a bid to force Juve to stump up the cash, the two parties agreed a cut-price compromise deal which saw him grab around £1m.

By the start of the following season, Ranieri had switched allegiances - and paymasters - to Roma.

A familiar pattern emerged; a bright start and a disappointing finish. His resignation by mutual consent followed after a string of miserable results in February 2011.

Remarkably, despite his average record as far as silverware is concerned, Ranieri is never short of offers from the biggest clubs when out of work.

Internazionale were next to gamble on the man who invariably delivers so little yet costs so much.

The parting of the ways was inevitable, but few could believe he was shown the door after just six months in charge.

He had been under intense pressure after a run of just one win in 10 matches left the club languishing in eighth place in the league table and struggling for European qualification.

Ranieri’s ill-feted reign came to an end in the aftermath of a painful 2-0 defeat against his former club Juventus, Inter’s ninth reverse of that season.

Never down for long, Ranieri fancied a change of scenery and left his homeland in May 2012 to work among the yachts and millionaires of Monaco.

He can argue a good case for success on the French riviera, leading the club to second in Ligue 1 and securing a Champions League spot after clinching promotion in his first season.

But after failing to beat Paris St Germain to the championship, the decision was made to call him the proverbial taxi in May this year. The bill is believed to be around £3m.
