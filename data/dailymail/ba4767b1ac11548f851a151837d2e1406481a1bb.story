Vigilantes of the world can get their hands on the ultimate superhero transport - after a Batmobile and Batcycle came up for auction.

And the stand-out model for comic book fans and wannabe caped crusaders is this recreation of the iconic 1960s Batmobile.

Holy supercar! Vigilantes of the world can get their hands on the ultimate superhero transport - after this Batmobile came up for auction

'To the auction house!' The Batmobile is being sold alongside this Batbike with the pair expected to fetch £80,000

Based on a the chassis of a 1966 Chevrolet, the model gets a V8 engine and all the design features seen on Bruce Wayne's special car.

It is being sold alongside the original Batcycle from the series with RM Auctions giving the package an estimate of just £80,000.

This makes it an absolute bargain compared to the original Batmobile - which is now worth in excess of £1.5million.

Mechanics at the American museum added indicators, horns, and an electrically operated cooling fan for the engine to stop it from overheating in stop-start traffic.

They added: 'The paintwork, a lustrous black, is also outstanding and complements the spotless engine bay, clean chassis and underbody, and tidy custom interior.

'The condition of this example leaves nothing to be desired, it is simply gorgeous and looks the part in every respect.

'The build quality is simply outstanding and it shows perfectly. It is truly the stuff dreams are made of.'

Kept in the Batcave, accessed through a hidden entrance, the Batmobile was loaded with gadgets vehicle used by Batman in his crime-fighting activities.

It is, in most incarnations, the primary vehicle of the Dark Knight.

Batman first drove the Batmobile in a Detective Comics book published in May, 1939.

A sedan, the vehicle was simply referred to as 'his car'.

It soon began featuring an increasingly prominent bat motif, typically including distinctive wing-shaped tailfins.

In the early stages of Batman's career, he modified the vehicleto give it armour and other high spec customisation to transform it into a sleek street machine.

The Batmobile has gone through numerous incarnations, and as state-of-the-art technology has continued to advance, the vehicle has had to change to stay a step ahead of real-life cutting edge advances.
