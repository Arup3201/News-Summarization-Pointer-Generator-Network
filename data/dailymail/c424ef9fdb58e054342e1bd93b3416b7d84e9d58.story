This dozy dog really is 'out fur the count'.

A home surveillance camera caught the moment Stafford Vaughan's dog Apollo rolled off the couch while sleeping and failed to stir.

Footage shows the canine lying still on the floor after the dramatic fall.

Vaughan of San Francisco then looks over to check if his pet is okay.

'Did you mean to do that?' he inquires.

When the question fails to trigger a response, Vaughan goes to check on his pooch.

As he gets down and rubs Apollo's back, the dog wearily 'reawakens' and stretches out his paws.

Vaughn reassured viewers that the pup was 'totally fine' and merely exhausted after a long day at the sitter's.

Many viewers have applauded the dog's deep-sleeping antics.

'I wish I could sleep that well,' one commenter wrote, while another added: 'Gives a whole new meaning to the phrase "dropped off."'
