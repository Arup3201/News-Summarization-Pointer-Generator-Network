A funeral director was fired after reporting a colleague for groping her, an employment tribunal has heard.

Mother-of-four Sky Knight, 38, alleged that embalmer Billy Shannon molested her as they changed a fuse together in the cellar of the funeral service where they worked.

The tribunal was told how Mrs Knight, 
who had worked at Highfield Funeral Service in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, for seven years, was sacked 
within weeks of reporting the alleged sex attack.

Funeral director Sky Knight claimed her colleague, embalmer Billy Shannon, groped her in the cellar of the funeral home where they worked

She claimed embalmer Mr Shannon 
grabbed her by the ponytail, kissed her and groped her 
breast in the cellar at the firm's Trinity Street 
premises to change a fuse.

She fled the cellar when Mr Shannon tripped on his apron.

Mrs Knight's counsel, Mr Simon Anderson, described the attack in the cellar as a 'violent sexual assault'.

The alleged attack happened in August last year and Mrs Knight was sacked for gross misconduct in December.

She then accused Highfield Funeral Service of sexual harassment and unfair dismissal.

Two weeks after the incident, the tribunal heard Mrs Knight was warned
about her flirtatious behaviour, low-cut tops and short skirts, though 
there had been no concerns raised previously.

Disciplinary proceedings were then launched as bosses at Highfield, part of the Diginity group, became concerned over the closeness of Mrs Knight's relationship with a rival funeral director, Mr Clive Pearson, of Marsden-based Pearson Funeral Service.

The tribunal heard how Mrs Knight went with Mr Pearson in one of his firm's vehicles to collect a body from Huddersfield Royal Infirmary.

This was for a Highfield client and Mrs Knight was said to have acted without permission.Mr Pearson was also seen regularly at Highfield's premises and was given one of Highfield's old desks when the funeral home was refurbished.

The hearing in Leeds was also told that Mrs Knight was 'carrying on' with married Mr Pearson and that rumours of their relationship was the talk of Huddersfield Crematorium. Mrs Knight denies having an improper relationship.

Highfield investigated the alleged assault but Mr Anderson said it was dealt with in a 'chauvinistic' manner.

But last week Mrs Knight, of Slaithwaite, settled her claim and dropped the case.

Mr Imsal Shahid, representing Highfield, said the terms of the settlement were confidential.

Mrs Knight declined to comment.
