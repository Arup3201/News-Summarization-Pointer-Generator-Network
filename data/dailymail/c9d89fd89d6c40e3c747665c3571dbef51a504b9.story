Two US Navy SEALs and a special operations demolition expert were among the seven US soldiers killed when a Black Hawk helicopter crashed in Taliban territory in Afghanistan on Thursday.

The cause of the crash in southern Kandahar province, which also left three Afghan soldiers and an interpreter dead, is unknown -- through military officials said it did not appear that the aircraft was shot down.

The casualties bring the US death toll 
this month to 25 -- putting August on track to be the deadliest month in
a year. More than 1,960 Americans servicemen have been killed since the 
war began more than a decade ago.

Destroyed: Three US soldiers were on the Black Hawk helicopter that crashed in Kandahar

Deadly region: The helicopter went down in a Taliban region of Kandahar province in southern Afghanistan

Violence is beginning to surge in the country as the Taliban begins its annual summer offensive. Last week, a total of 13 US Army soldiers and Marines were killed.Â 

August has been marked by a spate of 
'green on blue' killings, with Afghan police officers and soldiers 
opening fire on American troops.

Last
week, three elite Special Forces soldiers were taken by surprise and 
shot dead by an Afghan police officer who invited them to dinner.

Two British soldiers were been killed the month in a similar attack by a supposed ally.

The cause of the crash, which Afghan 
authorities said was in the Shah Wali Kot district of southern Kandahar 
province, was under investigation, the International Security Assistance
Force said in a statement.

The
Taliban claimed responsibility for shooting down the helicopter, 
although the insurgency often exaggerates its victories and is quick to 
claim responsibility for any incident involving foreign troop deaths.

The military said it does not believe the craft was under fire when it crashed, though the Navy plans to conduct an investigation to determine what happened.

The
area where the helicopter went down is an insurgent hotbed and supply 
route, lying north of Kandahar city near volatile Zabul and Uruzgan 
provinces.

The aircraft was reportedly destroyed on impact.

The Taliban shot down a CH-47 Chinook
transport helicopter in August 2011, killing all 38 people on board, 
including 25 US special operations soldiers.

The crash follows the deadliest month of the year for American troops. In July 40 soldiers were killed in war-related violence.

Americans are still dying at a rate of one per day in the country.

The US started drawing down forces from a peak of nearly 103,000 last year and plans to have decreased to 68,000 troops in Afghanistan by October.
