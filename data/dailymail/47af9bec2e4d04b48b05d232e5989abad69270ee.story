For some couples, love really does last a lifetime. But Linda and Arthur Treadwell's romantic tale is more unusual than most.

After marrying for the first time in 1966, the couple settled down to a happy married life before the tragic death of their sixth child left their relationship on the rocks.

But despite their 1985 split, love really did conquer all for the twosome who remarried early this week on the same day, at the same time and in the same place as their first nuptials.

Speaking after their second wedding, Linda, 66, who worked on the canal boats before her retirement, joked their relationship was a case of 'better the devil you know'.

She said: 'My family lived on a working canal boat and we used to bring grain down from London to a mill in Wellingborough and that’s where I met Arthur.

'He used to be there talking to the boat people. I had just turned 16 and we got married when I was 19. At the first wedding there was just my two sisters and his parents and uncle.

'But at the second one there was quite a few, the room was packed and we had bridesmaids and page boys and over 60 guests.'

She added: 'When we got married the first time I was pregnant with our oldest child Carol and she now jokes she is the only child who has been to both weddings.

'It was nice though because my sister Matilda was my bridesmaid at the first wedding and was a witness at the second ceremony.

'It’s a case of better the devil you know. Arthur was always there for me through the years and we never lost touch. We stayed close because of the children and even lived over the road from each other.'

But the couple's path to true love certainly hasn't run smoothly. In the intervening years, Linda enjoyed two 10-year relationships with other men, while 66-year-old labourer Arthur had a long-term girlfriend.

Following the end of their last relationships, the couple, now great-grandparents, decided to rekindle their 50-year romance.

'We decided to try again as a couple earlier this year because Arthur was always coming around and helping out with my dog and garden,' explains Linda.

'So he moved in to my house a few weeks ago and we decided to get married again. I wanted it to be at the same place on the same date because it would be special.'

The couple, who have 12 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, moved in with Arthur’s parents in Wellingborough in 1966.

They then moved to live with Linda’s parents who had moored the canal boat in Coventry, before returning to Wellinborough in 1976.

They didn’t get divorced until 1997 but stayed separate until January this year when they realised they wanted to get back together.

And they decided to give married life a second chance - much to the delight of their children Carol, 46, Louise, 44, Roger, 43, Tony, 41, and Lynnette, 32.

Linda added: 'We had six children in total but the youngest died when she was two days old. I needed Arthur to be with me but he was needed at work and that was the cause of us splitting up.

'He was at the funeral but he had to rush off to work and that was the final straw for me. I had two 10-year relationships but lived over the road from Arthur from the 90s.

'And earlier this year we realised he was helping out so much with my dog and my garden and doing my shopping that we should get back together. Now I don’t think we’ll ever look back.'

Arthur, who describes himself as a jack of all trades, added: 'I did have another partner but knew Linda was always the one for me.

'We stayed so close and were seeing each other a lot and have never been far apart. Everyone was saying it was about time we got married again and it feels like we have never been apart.'
