Sunderland and Leeds United meet in the FA Cup for the first time on Sunday since the 1973 final at Wembley.

Second Division Sunderland were the 1-0 victors over Don Revie’s holders thanks to a first-half goal from Ian Porterfield.

But the match is best remembered for goalkeeper Jim Montgomery’s remarkable double save from Trevor Cherry and Peter Lorimer.

On full-time, manager Bob Stokoe ran on to the pitch in his red tracksuit, overcoat and trademark trilby and a statue now celebrates that moment outside of the Stadium of Light.

Ahead of the third-round tie, Sportsmail’s Craig Hope went to meet Montgomery, defender Dick Malone – who scrambled the ball clear after the save – and midfielder Micky Horswill, who at 20 years old was the youngest player on the pitch.

We listened in to their memories of that famous day.

Craig: It’s Saturday, May 5, 1973, take it away…

Dick: Well, I never slept.

Micky: He was out on the town man!

Dick: Well, I didn't like to say that… But no, if I slept an hour I'd done well. I was just so pumped for the game that the match day started for me the night before.

Micky: I don't think any of us slept because we were so excited. The night before there was a preview show on the television with Jackie Charlton and Brian Clough on a panel. They were talking about how Leeds were going to pummel us and give us a good hiding. That geed us all up. We didn't need a team talk after that. I roomed with Joe Bolton, who was just one of the young lads. We ate bags of sweets all night and watched the television. The next morning we had breakfast with all the television cameras and we all went down in our scruffs, while Leeds in the other hotel were there in their suits and ties.

Jim: I think the biggest thing for me on cup final day was that we'd already beaten the other two top quality sides with Arsenal in the semi-final and Man City in an earlier round, so there was no reason why we couldn't beat Leeds. I wasn't having to deal with Eddie Gray, Johnny Giles and Billy Bremner though!

Micky: In those days you faced each other during the National Anthem, so I stared at Allan Clarke for some reason, because he was the top English player. That was the only time I was a little bit nervous.

Dick: To be honest, I don't think we ever thought we'd get beat. We didn’t go into any game thinking that.

Craig: Ian Porterfield put you ahead and then the moment we all remember, the save…

Jim: I've spoken to Peter Lorimer many times since and he says he hit it as sweet as he could. He always says he'd do the same again. Well, I'd do the same again too!

Micky: Monty made great saves all the time. You didn't realise it.

Jim: I think it was just the occasion. I probably did a better one against Hull City two weeks before that, but there were only two men and a dog there. It's when the cameras are there and it's the occasion. If we'd lost the cup, no-one would talk about it.

Dick: You should have held the first shot though!

Jim: Well if I had we wouldn't still be sat here talking about it would we?!

Craig: Then it’s full-time and Bob is running across the pitch…

Jim: For whatever reason, Bob chose to do that. That was Bob's way of releasing all his adrenaline. That was the way he was. I was looking around at all the supporters and waving, and then suddenly Bob appears.

Craig: What was that walk up to the Royal Box like?

Dick: Well, when Bob ran onto the pitch and wrapped his arms around me, he stuck his thumb in my eye! So I couldn't see very well going up or going down the steps.

Micky: When I was a kid, all I wanted to do was go up those steps, get my medal and turn around at the crowd. I remember afterwards in the dressing-room, Dave Watson came to me and said “do you fancy going back out on the pitch?”. So we went out with one of those red-and-white striped plastic bowler hats on and a bottle of champagne. There wasn't a person in the stadium, so we walked to the six-yard box and didn't say a word. We just took in this weird atmosphere, and thought back to the game. It was fantastic.

Craig: There must have been some party?

Jim: It was at The Dorchester. All the press expected Leeds to win, so all the cameras were at their hotel, but then they had to rush across to ours.

Micky: We'd been partying for hours, but we suddenly got hungry. Someone said do you fancy going for something to eat? We were on the end of Park Lane and we went to a burger place on Oxford Street. There we were, FA Cup winners in a burger place with a load of our fans at two o’clock in the morning. It was packed!

Jim: The biggest disappointment for me was that we had a game at Cardiff City on the Monday night. So on the Sunday morning, the wives had the cup on the bus and were driving home. They had people passing them on the motorway, hooting at them with the cup. But we had to go to Cardiff so we had a night out afterwards - we were a bit green going back!

Micky: We had to stop at Scotch Corner to get tidied up for the reception.

Craig: That must have been an incredible homecoming?

Dick: There was just red and white supporters everywhere hanging off the tops of buildings as we drove through town.

Jim: They pushed the beds out of the hospitals as we went past just so they could see it.

Micky: When we got to the stadium, they had a coffin with RIP Leeds on in the centre-circle.

Craig: You must have felt like superstars?

Dick: Not at all. At the time, Micky was on £25 a week and £25 appearance money.

Jim: I was on a lot more than that!

Dick: I was on about £100 quid, so was Jim. It was decent money but we weren’t that much better off than the man on the street, we mixed with them. I mean, my car failed its MOT three times! It was a sportsback Nissan type, nothing flash.

Micky: I had an old Ford Cortina.

Jim: I had a white Ford Corsair. Then when we won the cup I must admit I got a flashy sporty one…

Micky: But we were just ordinary blokes really. I was living in Annfield Plain in a little council house with my mam and dad. When we won the cup I signed a form to take it home for a day. I took it to the village in the boot of my car. I put it in my lounge and everyone from the council estate came and lined up for their photo taken – they had their babies in the top and all sorts.

Dick: I’m actually still living in the same house just outside of town.

Jim: I was living up the street from Dick and our favourite pub, The Barnes, was just down the road. We’d meet there for a couple of pints at half five then go and pick up our wives or girlfriends – some would pick both up! Then we went to see some fantastic turns in town, the likes of Tom Jones and Bob Monkhouse, brilliant times.

Craig: That one game has defined your lives really?

Jim: When I'm walking around the town now, they all know what we've done. But what I like is when they say they watched it at their aunty's because it was their first colour television. When they were getting their first colour TVs it shows you how long ago it was!

Micky: What amazes me is that people who were born 20 years after that all know us. Their parents have drilled it into them, so we're still household names with people who were born in the 80s or 90s. Maybe if we'd won a cup or two since then, we might not be as well known in the town.

Dick: It's a bit embarrassing still talking about it 42 years on though…

Listening to their tales, you get the impression they are far from embarrassed… and who can blame them?
