A New York firefighter debuted his new transsexual girlfriend in court on Wednesday as the jury began deliberating his fate on changes he beat and choked his ex.

Wanda Batista called Taylor Murphy her 'her big teddy bear,' despite allegations that he choked and battered his last girlfriend, Claudia Charriez.

Miss Charriez, a former escort and America's Next Top Model contestant, is also a transsexual. The case has hinged on her flamboyant testimony about Murphy's alleged attack on her in a Midtown hotel in August 2011.

Taylor's defense lawyers say Miss 
Charriez, 31, was just jealous of Taylor seeing other people - including
Miss Batista - and that the dispute in question was nothing more than a
lovers' quarrel.

His lawyers say he's a troubled heavy-drinker who has struggled with his sexuality. He has been embarrassed admitting to his FDNY firefighter friends that he's bisexual and prefers the company of flashy transsexuals.

'He's a sweetheart,' Miss Batista, who lives with Murphy, told the New York Post. 'He's my giant teddy bear and I just want to take him back home.'

Brunette Miss Batista teetered into 
court wearing stiletto boots that made her nearly as tall as 6-foot-4 
Murphy, who was once a FDNY calendar model.

'Hunky': Taylor Murphy is best known for his topless firefighters calendar. In court yesterday a woman burst into court with the image, screaming 'I love you Taylor.'

Jurors began considering Taylor's fate about noon on Wednesday.

The top charge, felony strangulation, carries a maximum penalty of seven years in prison.

Previously, Miss Charriez sobbed on 
the witness stand that she still loves Murphy and looked longingly at 
the defense table where he was sitting.

'I do love him!' Miss Charriez told jurors as Murphy's lawyers cross-examined her earlier this week.

Miss Charriez admitted, under questioning, to several inconsistencies in her report to police.

She also admitted to sending numerous
love-and-hate text messages to Murphy after the alleged beating - 
including telling him after his arrest 'Enjoy sucking your cell mate's 
d***.'

When she was confronted with these messages, Miss Charriez began sobbing.

'I do love you,' she shouted, looking over at Murphy in the courtroom. Murphy did not make eye contact and stared at his hands instead.

Murphy is accused of punching, biting and spitting on Miss Charriez during a fight in their Manhattan hotel room.
