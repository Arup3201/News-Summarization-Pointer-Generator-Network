A student who was so fat that she struggled to walk without crutches two years ago has shed a staggering nine stone - after she moved in next door to the gym.

Katie Lowe, 24, tipped the scales at nearly 21 stone after a series of operations on her knees led to her spending evenings on the sofa gorging on takeaways and piling on the pounds.

And after struggling to squeeze into size 28 trousers, the 5ft 4in English student realised she needed to take drastic action - and moved in next door to the gym to kickstart a new healthy living plan.

Now, two years on, Katie has lost a staggering nine stone - after swapping nights in for gym sessions and shunning pizza in favour of rustling up home cooked meals - and can slip into a size 12-14 dress.

And the PhD student - who also works full time in marketing - has become an internet sensation after blogging about her weight loss.

Katie, from Worcester, said: 'A year ago, I was so heavy I could barely walk. I’d be knocking back up to four different types of painkillers before breakfast some days.

'I’d always been big, but the weight just piled on after I injured my knees in 2007. I had three lots of surgery, and while I was recovering, I just got bigger and bigger.

'I went back to uni to study for a PhD, and I knew I couldn’t live the student lifestyle the way I had done before - I had to do something about my weight.

Student life took its toll on Katie and she gorged on pizza and junk food for her meals

'But I knew that if I was going to beat the bulge, I’d have to shun the takeaways - so I moved into the house next door to a gym.

'It was just what I needed to give myself a kick start. I met a fitness coach who helped me develop a lifestyle plan.

'I go to the gym a couple of times a week, but I also just do things like go for a walk around the park and think more carefully about what I eat.

'I’m thrilled with the amount of weight I’ve lost - I can’t believe the difference losing weight has made to my whole life. I’m so much happier now.'

Katie had struggled with her weight since she was a child - and only got even bigger after embracing student life as she studied at the University of Birmingham.

After injuring her knees, she struggled to walk very far.

Katie said: 'I was always the fat kid at school, hiding at the back in PE. My parents tried to get me to eat healthy meals, but I’d always sneak off and buy sweets and crisps at school.

'When I started at university, I did what most students do - spent my time drinking, eating processed food, and not moving around an awful lot.

'I’d tried dieting before, but always ended up putting all the weight back on again straight away.

'But this time, I didn’t want to do that - so when I moved house, I decided it might keep me motivated if I was living next to the gym - no excuses.'

Katie started a fitness programme put together by fitness consultant Matt Peacock - who devised healthy meal plans and exercise programmes to melt away the pounds.

Katie joined the gym, where she works out for 60-90 minutes three or four times a week and has seen a huge difference

And living next door to the St John’s Sports Centre, she had no excuse to miss a session.

Katie added: 'The programme has been brilliant for me - it’s a healthy lifestyle change I can stick to, rather than a faddy diet.

'I was so intimidated the first time I walked through the gym doors - I could barely walk for 30 minutes on the treadmill - but I love it now, and I even enjoy lifting weights.

'But making a few small changes to my life has made the world of difference.

'I make sure I eat small, healthy meals throughout the day, so I don’t get hungry, and I fit in my exercise around my life - I’ve started walking instead of taking the bus, and try and fit in a workout whenever I can.

Katie has changed her lifestyle completely and has now dropped to a size 12-14 dress from a size 24

'If I have a busy week ahead, I cook all my meals from scratch at the weekend and freeze them, so I don’t resort to ringing for a takeaway.

'The weight has dropped off, and I can’t believe I’ve lost almost half my bodyweight without ever once feeling hungry.'

Well being consultant Matt said: 'Katie has done excpetionally well, and we’re really proud of her.

'There’s no point telling someone they can never eat anything they enjoy again - that’s why people ditch their diets.

'We’ve tried to devise a plan that doesn’t make her feel like she’s missing out on anything, while doing a healthy amount of exercise a week.

'I tell her to try and get her heart to 115bpm for at least 60-90 minutes three or four times a week - which encourages the body to burn off fat reserves, rather than use energy from elsewhere.'

Katie said: 'I started blogging about my weightloss to keep myself on the straight and narrow - I thought if I made a public record of how well I was doing, it would force me not to give in.

'I now have thousands of people reading the blog everyday - which has amazed me. I’ve had lots of lovely messages from people all over the world, and I’m really pleased that people say I give them inspiration.

'Two years ago, I’d never set foot inside a gym, and never thought I would - so it just goes to show if I can do it, anyone can!'
