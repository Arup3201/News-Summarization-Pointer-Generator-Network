A woman who was warned her boyfriend would completely lose his memory after a serious car crash was astounded when he awoke from a coma and said: 'I don’t know who you are, I don’t know your name, but I love you.'

Chrissy Fryett was told to expect the worst when her partner Stewart was injured in a horror car crash in Stockton-on-Tees.

Medics warned her that if the 39-year-old did survive, he would never recognise her again.

But despite the odds Mr Fryett did survive, regained his memory and the couple, now married, have celebrated the birth of their first child together.

Mrs Fryett was warned her then boyfriend would completely lose his memory after a serious car crash, but was astounded when he awoke from a coma and said: 'I don't know who you are, I don't know your name, but I love you.' The couple have since married

The former painter had suffered a severe brain injury, broken ribs, collapsed lungs and shattered spine when a car he was a passenger in spun out of control and hit an oncoming vehicle.

When he woke up after 10 days in a coma, he declared his love for his now wife, 32, who had kept a bedside vigil for him.

For the next three months, Mrs Fryett helped her husband regain his memory of their relationship before the accident - to the amazement of medics who warned he may never happen.

Mrs Fryett, from Ingleby Barwick in Stockton-On-Tees, said: 'I cried when he said those words to me, and will never forget it.

'I was determined I wasn’t going to lose him. We had only met six months earlier, but we had fallen in love.

'I couldn’t believe it when I saw him trapped in the car, there was nothing I could do. The love of my life was slipping away from me.

'In those first weeks I spent hours talking to him about all the times we had spent together.

'We had planned our future before the crash, and I just prayed he would remember what we had.'

In 2009 the  father of six, was a passenger in a family friend’s new Ford Focus RS when the car hit a curb and collided with an oncoming car in Ingleby Barwick, near Middlesbrough, only 200 yards from where they had set off.

He spent almost three months at James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough.

Mrs Fryett said during this time his memory was incredibly sketchy and jumbled, with him not having any sense of time.

She would ask him what car he drove, and he would mention one from ten years ago.

'I told him about our first date. He would remember for an instant, but then forget straight away.

'One day I brought photographs in of us at a wedding we had gone to.

'"Remember",’ I said, "We got really drunk and felt awful the next day!"

Mr Fryett still has problems with short term memory and suffers from severe sleep apnea. He requires a high level of care and was awarded compensation for the accident in February this year

'Stuart began to laugh, and slowly things started to come back to him.'

Eventually the memories began to stick, and at Christmas that year Mr Fryett proposed.

In 2012 the couple got married, and just over two weeks ago Mrs Fryett gave birth to Oliver, their first child together.

She said: 'Oliver is a dream. He is just amazing.

'It was the final piece to the puzzle and now we are complete.

'He has just fitted into our little lives perfectly.”

'Stewart has five other children from before we met and they have adapted brilliantly to their dad’s situation.'

Mr Fryett is unable to walk long distances and uses a wheel chair to move around.

He still has problems with short term memory and suffers from severe sleep apnea. He requires a high level of care and was awarded compensation for the accident in February this year.
