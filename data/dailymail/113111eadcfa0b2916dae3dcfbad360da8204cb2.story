Sworn enemies tend to fight like cats and dogs.

The two popular pets are notorious for their mutual dislike. 

But Gertrude the pitbull and Earnestine the tabby are far more interested in cuddling like cat and dog in this adorable video.

Sadly there's no room for the owner in this relationship and he lurks in the background as the two friends groom each other.

Having won the feline's affection, the pitbull sits calmly on the sofa and sets aside his instincts to chase the cat.

Cats are known to groom their human companions as a sign of affection, but this owner doesn't look like he's getting a share of the love any time soon.
