For those of us that struggle to eat spaghetti with traditional cutlery the 'spaghetti fork' has been a dinnertime lifesaver for years.

Battery-operated, multi-pronged forks designed to make Italian inspired mealtimes easier are available in most kitchen departments.

And now the latest 'spaghetti fork' promising to end slurpy suppers is the Rolognese utensil from German firm Donkey which claims to roll up slippery pasta in an instant - the only downside is that you have to power it yourself .. with a crank handle!

The crank-enabled children's spaghetti fork costs £8 from Amazon and comes in blue and pink

The utensil, especially designed with 
children in mind, is the latest in a wave of revolutionary cutlery 
aiming to make the task of feeding yourself long pasta even simpler.

The Rolognese spaghetti utensil, made of wood and stainless steel, poses a technical solution to the 'problem' of rolling up spaghetti. It works by sitting the wooden-handled fork in the spaghetti and turning the handle. Like magic, the spaghetti curls around the fork without too much mess or fuss (and a bit of fun).

The adorably named fork should prove useful when it comes time to chow down on endless varieties of wiggly noodles. Parents may find their little ones are eating spaghetti better than them.

A spokesman for Rolognese says: 
'The time when our kids were lampooned by those wiggly noodles are now 
history. With our high-tech spaghetti fork, the tables are turned.'

If ramen, udon and yakisoba are your choice of stringy food though, perhaps the Calamete 'thumbed' fork from Japan Trend Shop would suit your needs.

The design of Calamete is based on the 
human hand, with a thumb that sticks out to make perfect twirling 
without needing the spoon.

While it’s difficult to fill a drawer with 
forks only for pasta night, this is an innovation that would work 
perfectly in plastic form as well, especially in Japanese convenience 
store meals.

The twirling spaghetti fork is surely a recipe for disaster. On the other hand no spoon equals less washing up

At the more hi-tech end of the spaghetti fork spectrum the twirling fork from Kitchen Craft, coming in 
at under £8, claims to swirls spaghetti up in an instant.

The motorised fork makes for plenty of twisting fun for children (or adults) who want to impress their guests during meals of spaghetti, tagliatelle or noodles.

A spokesman for Kitchen Craft says: 'Easy to operate, the fork is a useful gadget which requires little effort and avoids unwanted mess when enjoying spaghetti bolognese.'

And for the more stylish pasta connoisseurs a serving fork with a whopping six 
prongs from brand Alessi is made of mirror-polished stainless steel.

Six prongs are better than three: The Alessi Tibidabo spaghetti serving fork costs more than £13
