A Ukip general election candidate has apologised after a Twitter spat in which he appeared to suggest a German woman may have a sexually transmitted disease.

In a statement issued by Ukip, the party said Dr Jonathan Munday accepted that his comments in response to on-line 'carping' about his party's attitude to the NHS had been foolish.

Dr Munday, who works as a GP, drew criticism on Twitter after responding to a tweet claiming Ukip leader Nigel Farage did not support the NHS.

Dr Jonathan Munday wrote to a voter on Twitter: Both Nigel and I support the NHS. I have worked in it for 31 years. What has been your contribution - Piles and STD?'

Essex-born Dr Jonathan Munday lives in Northamptonshire and plans to contest Tory-held Wellingborough and Rushden in May's general election.

In a statement issued after yesterday's Twitter row, a Ukip spokesman said: 'Dr Munday accepts that his response was foolish, and apologises for that, but after a long day in his surgery he was annoyed by false carping claims that he didn't care for the NHS.

'He feels that his 30 years as a GP stands for itself in his support for the NHS and our healthcare system.'

The row comes after Mr Farage accused David Cameron of having 'openly lied' in the Commons when he claimed Ukip would privatise the NHS.

During Prime Minister Question's, Mr Cameron said 'Ukip policy' was to sell off the health service.

But Mr Farage immediately took to Twitter to attack Mr Cameron.

Mr Cameron made the comments after former Tory MP Mark Reckless, who defected to UKIP last year, asked why he would not commit to taking part in TV debates with Nigel Farage ahead of the general election.

Ukip MP Mark Reckless was called to ask a question during Prime Minister's Questions this afternoon

The Prime Minister replied: 'I made my views very clear, if we're going to have one minor party we should have all the minor parties and when this happens one point I will be making is what he said, Mr Farage, in 2012 about the NHS.

'The honourable gentleman [Mr Reckless] comes to this House week after week to talk about the NHS in Kent, well Mr Farage said this: 'We're going to have to move to an insurance based system of health care'.

'That is the UKIP policy, to privatise the NHS. I say never.'

Mr Farage tweeted: 'The Prime Minister just openly lied during PMQs.'

Ukip's health spokesman Louise Bours yesterday publicly slapped down Mr Farage after he suggested the NHS may need to be privatised to cope with the growing pressure on the health budget caused by a rapidly-ageing population.

The Ukip leader claimed that privatising large parts of the NHS was 'a debate that we're all going to have to return to' if the health service was going to stay affordable.

Within hours of the remarks Ukip's Health Spokesman, Louise Bours, insisted Mr Farage was out of touch with the public when it came to the NHS.

She said: 'Nigel is entitled to his opinion and others are entitled to theirs, we don't whip people into all thinking the same thing, like the establishment parties.

'As he has said before, he raised the idea for discussion a while ago, the party discussed at and rejected it.

'I am certain that if the party discuss it again, we will reject it again. The vast majority of Ukip members, the British public and I will always favour a state funded NHS.'
