A British Airways plane bound for Seattle from London Heathrow declared an emergency just 60 minutes into the flight today and was forced to turn back.

As the Boeing 777 was in airspace over Scotland, the pilot reportedly found a problem with the oxygen supply in the cabin, and declared their intent to return to its airport of origin. 

After the plane took a detour over the Irish Sea to 'dump fuel' it returned to London safely with all 218 passengers and 14 crew unharmed.

The plane was given priority to land at Heathrow forcing other incoming flights into a holding pattern during one of the airport's busiest periods.

A spokesperson for British Airways told MailOnline Travel that the aircraft returned to Heathrow 'as a precaution due to a suspected technical problem.'

'Our pilots are highly trained to deal with these scenarios,' said the spokesperson.

The plane was around an hour into the flight to Seattle when it declared an emergency over Scotland

A diversion then took place over the Irish Sea as the plane was forced to dump fuel

With regards to being forced to dump fuel, BA added: 'This is standard procedure. The aircraft has to dump fuel before landing to make sure it is not too heavy.'  

One Twitter user spoke of how he had picked up on his radio scanner that 'the crew were on oxygen masks while another report claimed the pilot was wearing a mask. 

A replacement flight is to be prepared to take off tonight at approximately 9pm, with passengers expected to arrive in Seattle about seven hour after they'd originally expected.
