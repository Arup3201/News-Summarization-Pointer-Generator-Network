Supermodel Heidi Klum has taken to Twitter to vent her anger after three models were snapped outside Buckingham Palace wearing items from her new lingerie range.

With decades of experience as one of the world's top supermodels, Heidi is well versed at showcasing designers wares.

But the 41-year-old German beauty took exception to the palace being used as a backdrop in a photoshoot for items from her lingerie range.

The supermodel issued a Tweet questioning the decision to take photographs of models wearing items from her lingerie range outside Buckingham Palace

The models, wearing pastel coloured lacy underwear and suspenders, were seen striking a variety of poses on a cold March morning at the weekend.

Writing on her Twitter account next to an image of the photograph,  Heidi said: 'Nearly fell off my chair when I saw this. Who did this??? Not me!!! #NotCool'

Her Tweet has earned more than 11,000 'likes' from her legion of followers and been shared by fellow Twitter users 88 times. 

The mother-of-four is the star of her own underwear campaign and has been snapped showing off her ageless physique in the skimpy designs.

And she displayed one item of the lingerie line at the UK  launch of Heidi Klum Intimates range at London's Selfridges last week.

Her green bra was clearly visible under her black mesh sweater, which she teamed with a pair of skin-tight black leather trousers and suede pointy heels.

In demand: Hordes of fans lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the statuesque stunner

With her golden locks parted in the centre and falling below her shoulders, the star arrived in a black cab emblazoned with the words 'Heidi Klum Intimates at Selfridges'.

As fans gathered to watch her glamorous arrival, she stepped out wearing a smart black pea coat, which she later shed to show off her racy top.

Heidi has been on a busy schedule, promoting the Bendon-made line - which she's now the face of following Elle Macpherson's departure - on Good Morning America in New York just a day before.

She said on GMA about her new venture: '[Bendon] asked me to take over the reins and continue to design for them. Now it’s called the Heidi Klum Intimates line and I’m so excited because I’ve been doing lingerie and wearing lingerie for many, many years.

'So basically I kept most of the styles that women have loved for the last 25 years that Elle created, and now I give them different laces, different colours, and then I added on a few new styles that weren’t existing – racer backs or beautiful strapless bras.

'So I kind of added on and put my own twist to it, and it’s so much fun. It’s a great opportunity for me and I was very thankful for that.'

Hell for leather: Heidi teamed her racy top with a pair of skin-tight black leather trousers and suede heels

Stepping in: Heidi recently became the face of the line following Elle Macpherson's October departure

Elle's  departure from the line, and Bendon, was announced in October. CEO Justin Davis-Rice said: 'Elle has been a great partner to Bendon, however it’s time to take the brand to even greater heights, and Heidi is perfectly positioned to do just that.

According to Women's Wear Daily, 50-year-old Elle's three lines for Bendon - Macpherson Men, The Body and the Intimates range - are worth an estimated $150million and turn over around $750million a year.

Bendon's CEO told the publication that he is expecting the brand to grow by at least $25million right away, with Heidi at the helm helping to up retail orders by 25 per cent.

The supermodel, who has tried her hand at designing in the past, also discussed the shimmering silver gown she wore to the Vanity Fair Oscars after party last month, which featured sexy cut-outs revealing that she wasn't wearing any underwear.

'I wasn’t wearing much underwear with that dress,' Heidi laughed. 'This dress was my favourite dress of the show, that Donatella [Versace] created, and I just loved it.

'And as soon as I saw it walking down the runway I immediately emailed and I said, “Please, I want to put this dress on hold for the Oscars.” And they sent it to me and thankfully it fit and I loved it. I love it sparkly – I’m still a German at heart.'

Tried and tested: Heidi said that she has kept most of the styles designed by Elle, adding her own twists

Shades of change: Among the changes Heidi has incorporated are different laces and colours

New era: Elle Macpherson oversaw three lines for Bendon before her October departure
