Everyone has their reasons for travelling - be it to get the ultimate tan, taste exotic dishes or dive into history - but most of us have the same goal in mind.

TripAdvisor's new TripBarometer: Psychology of Travel report, examined motivations behind holiday choices and found that 'enhancing perspective' drives 71 per cent of global travellers to go on holiday. 

But precise motivations vary from continent to continent. North Americans, for example, hope to strengthen relationships with loved ones, while Europeans really just want to brag about their experiences.

Travellers are also nine times more likely to crave unique rather than pampered experiences, while 38 per cent of global holidaymakers expand their diets to include the new foods they tried during their travels.

Five per cent of travellers say a trip motivated them to get engaged or married.

And it's no surprise that holidaymakers are finding plenty of rewards from seeing the world. Forty-five per cent say they are inspired to be more tolerant of others when they return home, and 37 per cent are eager to learn a new language or skill that they encountered abroad.
