Julia Mancuso has won bronze in the women's alpine skiing super combined, taking her Olympic medal tally to four - the most ever for an American female alpine skier.

The 29-year-old, from Squaw Valley, California, punched the air after coming in just 0.53 seconds behind gold medal winner Maria Hoefl-Riesch of Germany on Monday.

Hoefl-Riesch won with a combined time of 2:34.62, 0.40 seconds ahead of Nicole Hosp of Austria in second. Hoefl-Riesch was fifth fastest in the downhill, but her superior slalom skills gave her the gold.

Medalists: Austria's Nicole Hosp (left) took silver, Germany's Maria Hoefl-Riesch (center) took gold and Mancuso (right) took bronze. She told reporters she hoped to take a medal in memory of her grandfather

Mancuso's Olympic tally includes a gold in giant slalom from the 2006 Turin Olympics and silvers in downhill and super-combined in Vancouver in 2010. She also competed in the 2002 Olympics.

Her number of medal wins are the most ever for an American female Alpine skier. Lindsey Vonn is behind her, having gained two medals in Vancouver in 2010.

Going into Sochi, Mancuso was the 
fourth-ranked female Alpine skier in the world. In 2013, she gained 
medals in 10 World Cup races.

Ahead of Monday's win, she said she was competing for her maternal grandfather, Denny Tuffanelli, who died little more than a year ago. Her grandmother is in Sochi to watch her compete.

Excitement: Mancuso, who wore a tiara to the ceremony, previously said that it is a symbol of confidence and should be worn whether or not you're winning. She has an underwear line called 'Kiss My Tiara'

Julia Mancuso holds the record for the number of Olympic medals won by an American female alpine skier:

Gold for Giant Slalom at Turin 2006Silver for Downhill at Vancouver 2010Silver for Combined at Vancouver 2010Bronze for Combined at Sochi 2014

She had tweeted before the win: 'My grandpa is smiling down
 at me from heaven and saying I can be proud no matter what happens! 
This one's for you Grandpa Denny :) #discotime'

The event, which includes a downhill run and a slalom run, tests racers' all-around ability to be fast and technically correct.

But the course proved to be challenging, especially on a steep slalom track as clouds hovered above.

Mancuso
 won the silver medal for combined four years ago in Vancouver, but 
trained very little in slalom in the run up to this year's event. USA Today predicted that other women would pass her during the slalom event.

'Slalom
 for me is kind of like a game of luck,' Mancuso had said a few days 
ago. 'Roll the dice and it's on, or roll the dice and it's off.'

Joy: After the win, Mancuso shared this photo on Instagram, writing: 'What!!!!!! #Sochi2014 #sochiselfie #bronze can't believe it'

For Grandpa: Ahead of her win, she tweeted that she was racing for her grandfather, who died a year ago

Proud: Mancuso is pictured with her grandmother Sheila Tuffanelli, whose husband passed away a year ago

Before heading to Sochi, Mancuso posed in a revealing catsuit with a scooped back for a photo shoot featured in GQ.

'It's
 not a shock to me when I have a good race,' she told the magazine. 'I 
started to tell people Iâ€™d just worn my lucky underwear.'

And

 she knows a thing or two about underwear as in 2010, she designed her 
own underwear line, Kiss My Tiara - merging her active lifestyle with 
her dream 
of becoming a fashion designer.

Of
 the name, she explained: 'My belief is everyone is a princess and 
rocking the tiara everyday no matter if you're winning or losing is 
something to just believe in yourself. It's a sign of self confidence.'

Baring all: She told GQ ahead of Sochi that it didn't surprise her when she had a successful run
