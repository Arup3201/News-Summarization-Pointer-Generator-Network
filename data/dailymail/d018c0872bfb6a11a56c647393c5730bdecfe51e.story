The number of British women dying from breast cancer has fallen by more than 10 per cent in five years.

The death rate from the disease is now on par or lower than France and Germany, according to Italian and Swiss researchers.

Ten years ago the UK's death rate from the disease was higher than France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain.

Scientists say the death rate has fallen fastest among under 50s claiming better treatment and not screening appears to be the reason

However, although British women with breast cancer
now have a better chance of beating the disease, the 
country still lags behind the European average.

Scientists say the death rate has fallen fastest among under 50s, claiming better treatment and not screening appears to be the reason for the decline.

They said deaths will continue falling this year to 15.95 per cent per 100,000 women compared to 18.39 per 100,000 women in 2007.

This represents a drop of 13 per cent over five years.

UK

-10.64%

SPAIN

-9.21%

FRANCE

-8.89%

ITALY

-7.71%

GERMANY

-7.15%

POLAND

-2.48%

EU OVERALL

-8.44%

However, it's still shy of the European average of 14.9 deaths per 100,000 women.

Spain tops the league, with fewer than 12 per 100,000 in the population predicted to die of the disease.

The findings were published in the 
journal Annals of Oncology after researchers studied cancer rates in 27 
member states of the E.U. using World Health Organisation (WHO) data.

Dr Rachel Greig, of the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said that it was 'reassuring' to see that the number of deaths from the disease could fall at a time when the number of women contracting the disease is increasing.

She said 12,000 women a year were still dying of the disease in Britain.

Professor Carlo La Vecchia, one of
the study leaders from the University of Milan, told the Daily 
Telegraph that the figures show 'important advancements in treatment and management are playing a major role in the decline in death rates'.

A Department of Health spokesman said more than £750million was 
being invested to help diagnose cancer earlier and provide people with 
access to the latest treatments in order to save 5,000 more lives a year
by 2015.
