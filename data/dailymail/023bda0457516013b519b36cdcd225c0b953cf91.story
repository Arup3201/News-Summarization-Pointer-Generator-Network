There's no need to be disappointed about this week's news that resveratrol (found in red wine and chocolate) won't help you live longer, as scientists are now championing a different antioxidant in the fight against ageing.

Called glutathione, it is molecule produced by the body to fight free radicals.

Dr Yannis Alexandrides, a Harley 
Street plastic surgeon and founder of a new supplement containing the ingredient, said: 'Glutathione is the body's most powerful 
antioxidant and detoxifying agent, but outside the science community, 
few people have even heard of it.

Beauty boost: Three 111SKIN capsules must be taken a day to stimulating the production of glutathione - which is said to combat the signs of ageing

'It's now time to raise 
awareness on thismolecule that delivers incredible health 
benefits, and even helps slow the aging process.'

Glutathione has such a powerful regenerative effect on cells, when someone takes a paracetamol overdose and the liver goes into failure, to reverse the effect and ultimately stop them dying, they are given a pure Glutathione drip.

But the makers of the new supplement,  111SKIN, have used it to create a product aimed at those who want younger looking skin.

Three capsules must be taken a day to stimulate the production of glutathione, with the theory being that the body's cells ability to fight free radical damage is 
then strengthened, and the ageing process is delayed.

As with much of the 111skin range, the supplement was developed with the help of astronauts.

Dr Alexandrides explains: 'My team of scientists 
previously worked on the Soviet Space Programme, and their role was to 
keep astronauts in orbit in peak health and this meant harnessing the 
ability to raise the levels of the most powerful antioxidant in the 
body.

'They discovered that NAC supplements combined with key vitamins in
 their purest form, effectively stimulated the production of glutathione, and they patented their formula unique to 111SKIN.'

Dr Alexandrides claims their formula is more effective than other  glutathione supplements currently on the market which have been found to be ineffective when taken orally because it is poorly absorbed and broken down by the stomach.

111SKIN launches at Harrods in August with a bottle of 90 capsules costing £75. In the meantime, it's available via their website 111skin.com.

Dr Alexandrides said: 'It's 
always been our goal to bring these supplements to a wider market, and 
as environmental and lifestyle aggressors increase on earth, we knew 
that space would dictate the future for wellbeing.'

For those who would rather not take three tablets a day - or shell out £75 for the capsules - but still want to see if they can tackle the signs of ageing with glutathione, simply eat more foods containing the antioxidant.

Glutathione can be found in numerous fruit and vegetables including broccoli, brussel sprouts, cabbage, red peppers, avocados, peaches, watermelon and tomatoes.
