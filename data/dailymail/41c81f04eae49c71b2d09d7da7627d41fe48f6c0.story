Award-winning: Fifty Shades of Grey has been crowned Book of the Year

It has already been crowned the best-selling book of all time, eclipsing the sales of J K Rowling's Harry Potter books.

So it may not come as a surprise that the tale of a virginal heroine who falls for a bondage-loving billionaire has been voted Book of the Year.

E L James's steamy sensation Fifty Shades of Grey was voted number one by the reading public.

Ms James beat other highly-acclaimed authors to the top spot, including Hilary Mantel, who made the top 10 for her Bring Up The Bodies and BBC presenter Clare Balding for her autobiography.

The
 novel, the first of a trilogy of saucy tales dubbed 'mummy porn', has 
become a literary phenomenon, selling more than six million copies to 
become the best-selling book of all time in the UK.

It
 won more than three-quarters of the votes after the public were asked 
to cast a ballot for their favourite read as part of this year's 
Specsavers National Book Awards.

Ms James said: 'Thank you so much for this wonderful award. I am truly honoured.

'I
 have to thank the readers and the retailers for making Fifty Shades of 
Grey the success it has become. It's really quite overwhelming.'

The trilogy, about a sado-masochistic
 relationship between a college graduate, Anastasia Steele, and a young 
business magnate, Christian Grey, has been a publishing sensation.

Rights to the books have been sold around the world and the trilogy is being published in languages including Albanian, Chinese, Russian, Serbian and Vietnamese.

All three books are due to be filmed as part of a movie deal.

Previous winners of the award have included One Day by David Nicholls and Caitlin Moran’s How To Be A Woman.

Those authors nominated for the award were the winners of ten categories of the Specsavers National Book Awards which were held earlier in December.

Nominees included Ratburger by David Walliams, who won Children's Book of the Year, The Hairy Dieters by Si King & Dave Myers, which won Food and Drink Book of the Year and Clare Balding who won autobiography of the year for My Animals and Other Family.
