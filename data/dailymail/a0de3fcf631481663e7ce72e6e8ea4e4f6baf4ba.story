A patient who had overdosed on pills after breaking up with his girlfriend died after doctors allegedly failed to give him urgent liver treatment, an inquest heard.

Anthony Seddon, 30, who had split up with his girlfriend, took a lethal dose of painkillers which had been prescribed for a stranger.

But doctors allegedly failed to return an emergency call for him to undergo a potentially lifesaving liver transplant at a specialist unit and he died the following day.

As he lay dying at Tameside Hospital in Greater Manchester staff urged that he be transferred to a specialist liver treatment unit 70 miles away at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham - only for no one from the centre to call back, a coroner heard.

Anthony Seddon, 30, took painkillers and was found slumped on the floor before being taken to hospital

The hearing in Sale was told the musician, from Ashton-under-Lyne, suffered with bipolar disorder for 12 years.

He was a keen walker and cyclist but he started to become bloated after a course of medication.

His mother Donna Thomas told the inquest: 'He had never had any issue with his weight before. He reminded me of Forrest Gump - he would just run and walk and walk and cycle everywhere.

'He never had a weight issue until the last two years or so and that affected him massively.'

The tragedy occurred last March after Mr Seddon was found slumped on the floor of his flat by a friend after swallowing a concoction of prescription drugs through the night.

Mrs Thomas said: 'We knew he was very vulnerable because of the relationship but he was lucid for hours afterwards.

'We took one look at him and he was a funny colour. It was obvious it hadn’t just happened.

'He was very calm and told us exactly what he had taken. He let us phone the ambulance.'

Dr Vinod Patel, a consultant Gastroenterologist from Tameside Hospital told the hearing: 'I got involved with his care straight away.

'The drugs were already damaging his liver at a rate of knots. Nothing in the body will clot at that stage because the liver is effectively dying.

'His blood pressure was also low. At this point his prognosis was extremely poor.'

A specialist unit in Leeds was called, but they had no space for Mr Seddon, so a unit in Birmingham was contacted.

Dr Patel said; 'When a person is this bad you know there is a space of about 24 hours where they could die. At this point the damage to his liver was quite serious.

'Without a liver transplant his prognosis was extremely poor.

'But we didn’t get a response back from Birmingham until he had passed away.

'They should have called back. We expected them to call back that afternoon.'

However, Dr Patel later appeared to indicate that he had had contact with the Birmingham unit.

He told the inquest: 'Birmingham told us to carry on as we were.'

Det Insp Richard Ennis of Greater 
Manchester Police who investigated Mr Seddon’s death said he had not 
known that the empty boxes of tablets were prescribed to a woman.

He added: 'There was nothing left at the house in terms of a note which would often happen in a suicide.

'In
terms of trying to establish intentions with this case we must note 
that he was alive and talking when police arrived and I am aware from 
the notes that he made comments regarding splitting up from his 
girlfriend and the fact he wanted to be with her in spirit and that gave
us a reason as to why he took the tablets.

'It may have been a cry for help. He said he had taken them as a spur of the moment decision so there was no prior planning.

'I agree that it was an impulsive act.'

The inquest was adjourned until December for further inquiries to be made.

After the case Mr Seddon’s mother Donna Thomas, said: 'If anything from today can help the situation then we’re willing to wait to work out exactly what happened surrounding his death.

'But we know there’s nothing else that could have been done to save him. We did have concerns about some things and we do think some things could have been done better.'

Since their son’s death, they have set up the Anthony Seddon Memorial Fund to raise money to provide schoolchildren in Manchester with education on mental illness. They have already raised more than £7,500 since he died.

Mrs Thomas added: 'Since he died we have been inundated with calls from families whose children may be just starting with similar symptoms and they are so relieved that there is somebody out there talking about it.

'People think everybody will be like Anthony but he was very extreme.

'He was very poorly and most of the people we come into contact with are not as severe as Anthony. We want to change and help people to stop being ashamed.

'We get everyone from 80-year-old women to 17-year-old girls coming to talk to us because they can talk to us and feel comfortable.'
