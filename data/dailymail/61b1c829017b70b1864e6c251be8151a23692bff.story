Growing change: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson wants rules relaxed on GM crops for UK farmers

UK ministers want the European Union to relax restrictions on the cultivation of genetically-modified crops.

Owen Paterson wants to make it easier for farmers to grow GM plants for human consumption, even though critics lambast the idea as ‘Frankenscience’.

In a speech next week, the Environment Secretary is expected to cite growing scientific evidence that GM foods are safe, as well as surveys showing a relaxation of the rules would be supported by the majority of farmers.

Mr Paterson will say there is a need for a new approach to GM to ensure Britain ‘is not left behind’ in agricultural science.

However, any such move will be in the teeth of much opposition. A survey by YouGov out today found only 21 per cent of the population supported the technology, while 35 per cent opposed it.

Yesterday science minister David Willetts supported calls for controls on GM crops to be weakened.

‘We believe GM crops can help make agriculture more efficient and also just as importantly more sustainable, by, for example, reducing the use of pesticides and the use of fossil fuels,’ he said.

Whitehall sources told the Independent newspaper that ministers are increasingly concerned that the potential moral and ethical benefits of GM are being ignored by costly and bureaucratic licensing regulations.

A twelfth of global arable land is under GM cultivation, and ministers fear Britain – the birthplace of the 18th century agrarian revolution that modernised the world – faces being left behind.

GM crops can be engineered to grow faster, increase their resistance to weeds, pests and pesticides, produce extra nutrients or survive harsher weather.

But while they are widely grown in the Americas, they are effectively banned in the UK and Europe where they are considered on an extremely strict case-by-case basis.

Ministers argue that GM technology has 
the potential to improve crop yields, help the agricultural industry and
provide benefits to human health through vitamin fortification. It 
could also help combat diseases such as ash dieback and help in the 
development of new medicines.

A source told the Independent: ‘The point about GM is not simply about food production.

‘There are wider potential environmental and economic benefits to the technology both in the UK and internationally.

‘What we want to do is start a dialogue within Europe on GM, based upon the science.’

Mr Paterson wants to build support in Brussels for a relaxation of GM rules and hopes powerful Germany will come on side.

But others will be opposed. In April, Poland became the eighth EU member state to ban the cultivation of GM crops.

A poll of more than 600 British farmers found a considerable shift in their stance toward GM over the past year.

Nearly a third said they would be more likely to grow the crops now than they were a year ago.

Martin Haworth of the National Farmers’ Union said: ‘Farmers are becoming more and more aware that climate change doesn’t mean a gradual rise in temperatures but rather a stream of extreme weather events. GM technology is one possible way of mitigating this.’
