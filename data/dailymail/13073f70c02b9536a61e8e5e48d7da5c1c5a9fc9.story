Ships, oil rigs and offshore wind farms are at risk from rough seas.

But radar instruments on satellites are being used to forecast extreme wave heights that could endanger people and the environment.

The satellites measure wind speed by monitoring at the surface of the sea from multiple angles as they fly over, calculating how rough the waters are and in turn the height of waves.

Radar instruments on-board satellites look at the surface of the sea they are flying over.

They measure the reflectivity of the water, which is determined by the roughness of the surface.

Higher reflectivity is caused by strong winds, which create higher waves, whereas lower reflectivity indicates a gentle breeze and calm waters.

Wind speed can be calculated by measuring the reflectivity of the sea.

Using a computer model, experts can then work out the wind direction and the height of waves.

This data is then translated into hypnotic animations that reveal the precise movement of the seas.

A recently released video produced by the European Space Agency (Esa) shows such a map of the North Sea, which also plots oil rigs, wind farms and large ships.

The animated model takes into account the wind’s speed and direction in order to predict the height of the waves that could batter the infrastructure.

Radar satellites such as Sentinel 1 improve the calculations of wind fields and wave height by measuring the reflectivity of the water, determined by the roughness of the surface and therefore the wind speed.

high and it is possible to see how areas of rough sea ripple in 
different directions

The height of waves largely depends on the speed of the wind whipping across the surface of the water.

Higher reflectivity of the water caused by strong wind creates higher waves and wind direction can be calculated by experts studying satellite images to pinpoint ‘streaks’ on the water’s surface, Wired reported.

In the animation, pale blue denotes calm waters, while bright purple indicates waves of up to 49ft (15metres) high and it is possible to see how areas of rough sea ripple in different directions.

All this data can be used to warn captains of ships and workers aboard offshore infrastructure of dangerous conditions.

In the past, towering waves have destroyed expensive offshore wind farms and wrecked ships, while there is a chance of wreaking environmental havoc if an oil rig is badly damaged.

The height of waves largely depends on the speed of the wind whipping across the surface of the water. Here, a ship called the Harvester powers through huge waves in the North Sea
