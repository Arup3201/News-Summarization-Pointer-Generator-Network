Thugs who dumped huge chunks of concrete on to passing cars could be linked to 30 separate incidents on the same stretch of road police have revealed.

Officers said they were looking into a string of attacks on the A12 near Brentwood, Essex, in the past two years, including one in 2008 where a bucket-shaped piece of concrete smashed through the roof of a Landrover Discovery after it was dropped from  Fryerning Bridge near Ingatestone.

Three teenage boys from Chelmsford were 
arrested and eliminated in 2009 but Detective
Chief Inspector Keith Davies from Essex Police said he would be
speaking to them again as part of an investigation into two attacks last week.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Scene: The attackers threw the rock from this bridge in Ingatestone onto Miss Horne's car. Police are now investigating 30 other incidents since 2008

Last Thursday, a 1ft-wide slab of concrete was hurled from the same bridge on to Lisa 
Horne's car and 40 minutes later a similar attack happened three miles 
away which left a woman fighting for her life. Both incidents are being treated as attempted murder.

Mr Davies confirmed officers had pinpointed 30 similar incidents since 2008.

He told the Daily Mirror: 'It would be foolish 
to not consider that these latest incidents are in some way linked to 
some of the attacks in 2008.

'They are similar because of both the bridge used and the type of missile.'

Lucky: Lisa Horne, left, with her mother Stella who was also in the car with her when it was hit by a concrete block. Both women astonishingly escaped uninjured

The
block landed on the back seat of the 51-year-old David Ackland's Discovery where his 
grandfather usually sat. No one was charged over 
the incident, but it caused £5,000 of damage.

At the time, Mr Ackland, from Romford, Essex, accused the police being 'flippant' in their investigation.

This week officers were examining clues from a 
forensic examination of both bridges. The force has increased patrols in the area and is appealing for information from the public.

David Ackland's discovery had £5,000 of damage when a bucket-shaped piece of concrete, left, smashed through the roof, right in 2008. Fortunately no one was injured but no one was charged for the incident either

Mr Davies said: 'Even a stone thrown from a bridge 
can be fatal, but when you look at the size of this concrete, it is 
amazing that the consequences were not far, far worse.’

Yesterday, Miss Horne told how she felt lucky to be alive following Thursday's ordeal.  

The 26-year-old was on the A12 heading home after Christmas shopping with her mother when the block slammed into her bonnet and shattered the windscreen.

Weapon: This is the 1ft x 1ft rock which hit Lisa Horne's Vauxhall Astra when it was thrown from Fryerning Bridge near Ingatestone

Damaged: This is the Vauxhall Astra at the roadside after it was hit by the rock while travelling at 55mph. It damaged the bonnet and shattered the top of the windscreen but did not penetrate it so Lisa and Stella escaped uninjured

Speaking for the first time yesterday the mother-of-two said: ‘I was
very lucky to have walked away from it. If I had been travelling 1mph 
faster it might have come straight through the windscreen and things 
would have ended differently.

‘The police are right to describe it as attempted murder.’ 

She added: ‘I can’t understand how anybody could do something like that. They need to be caught to prevent it happening again.

'I
was running low on petrol so I wasn’t driving very fast.

'It was as if someone had put their hands over my eyes and I heard a bang and my windscreen just shattered.

Second attack: The interior of the Nissan which was hit by a second concrete block last Thursday on the same stretch of road. A 57-year-old woman is still in hospital after that attack

Smashed: The full extent of the damage to the Nissan car and shattered windscreen can be seen here. Police are treating both attacks as attempted murder

'It
was the loudest bang I’ve ever heard. I swerved across the road and 
luckily I had my mum in the car. She said “Lisa get over to the hard 
shoulder”.

'I couldn’t work out what had come off the bridge. A few cars went past and hit it.'

Miss Horne went on: 'The policeman who was
there said "You’re very lucky to have walked out of this". Somebody was 
looking down on us that night.

'I’m scared it’s going to happen to someone else and I want them caught. I certainly won’t be driving in the dark.'

Heavy weight: The bucket-sized piece of concrete dropped from the A12 bridge

Mindless: The concrete block was flung from West Hanningfield Bridge pictured

She
said: 'I cannot understand why someone would do that. I just cannot 
understand they are just not normal people to do something like that.

'It is not fair, you could have taken peoples' lives away and left my children without a mum.'

Her mother Stella told the press conference that she could not understand the mentality of the thugs who hurled the rock.

'I just don't know how they went home that night and slept,' she said. 'They could have killed four people within half an hour.

'I just don't understand how people could do that. I cannot sleep thinking about it.'

Scene of attack: Police on West Hanningfield Bridge over the A12, where the second concrete block was thrown onto a Nissan car

Appeal: Police and press at West Hanningfield Bridge in Essex after the second attack last Thursday. Police are calling on witnesses with any information to come forward

The second attack, less than three 
miles away, left a 57-year-old passenger from Harold Hill, east London fighting for her life with head
and chest injuries. She is now stable in hospital.

Essex Police said the block, which
smashed through the windscreen of her and her husband's Nissan from West Hanningfield bridge, near Galleywood, may have been used as a bollard at a 
nearby house.

On Sunday evening, the road was closed again after someone thought they saw someone throwing a block from a nearby bridge.

Danger area: The red pin at Ingatestone is the scene of the first attack
and the second red pin is the bridge at West Hanningfield. The blue pin
indicates where a suspected attacker was seen on Sunday but this has 
now been discounted

However, after finding nothing suspicious during a search of the area, police later reopened the road.

A spokesman from Essex Police said: 'This was a genuine report and we would encourage such calls.

'We
are sorry for the disruption. But motorists and the surrounding 
communities understand that safety is of paramount importance as is 
catching the perpetrators behind these attacks.'

Meanwhile, police in Shrewsbury 
launched an investigation after concrete blocks were dropped from a 
bridge on to a road in the town. A West Mercia Police spokesman said: 
‘Fortunately, no one was hurt.’

Terrified: Lisa Horne and her mother Stella fear that if they had been travelling faster than 55mph on the dark road they could have been seriously injured. Miss Horne says she will no longer drive in the dark
