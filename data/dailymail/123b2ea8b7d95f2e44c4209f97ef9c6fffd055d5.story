Millwall players will make history on Remembrance weekend when they run out against Brentford in a special camouflage strip in aid of injured troops.

The Football League have granted Millwall special permission to wear the army colours as they raise money for Headley Court - the military rehabilitation centre in Leatherhead, Surrey.

Headley Court treats injured members of the Armed Forces and the Lions will line up for the Championship clash with the centre's name across the front of the shirts after regular sponsors Euroferries agreed to the switch.

Ian Holloway added a voice-over to the video launch of the kit, reading John McCrae’s First World War poem In Flanders Fields, and the Millwall manager admitted he got emotional during the recording.

He told The Sun: 'It is fair to say I had a lump in my throat and my eyes may have been watering. But this again shows what Millwall is all about and, until I came here, I didn’t realise quite how much this club reaches out to the real things in life.

'I am bursting with pride that we’re supporting Headley Court, where people who have fought for our country with such loyalty, honesty and bravery are being cared for.

'All of us at Millwall are proud to stand with them.'

The club are looking to raise £20,000 and will be selling 1,500 of the £50 shirts with proceeds from each going to Headley Court.

Headley Court patients will be at the Brentford game on November 8 as special guests.
