A woman driver has said she is 'thankful to be alive' after she drove her car onto a level crossing.

Sarah Frampton, 28, failed to spot any of the flashing lights, claxons and warning signs as she drove towards the crossing in Trencreek, Cornwall.

She pulled onto the tracks and suddenly spotted a single carriage First Great Western train hurtling down the local branch line towards her.

Near-death experience: Driver Sarah Frampton of St Newlyn East, Cornwall, said she felt 'lucky to be alive' after driving onto a level crossing in Trencreek, Cornwall

Wrecked: The train sliced the front off Miss Frampton's Peugeot 406 and span it around on its axis - but she managed to walk away without a scratch

The train ripped the front off her Peugeot 406 and span it around on its axis - but Miss Frampton managed to walk away without a scratch.

There were just two passengers on the 19.25 Newquay to Par service, who were uninjured as the train was not derailed.

Miss Frampton, from nearby St Newlyn East, Cornwall, said she desperately tried to brake her car when she saw the train but could not stop before the impact.

She said: 'I'd been rushed off my feet all day and was not aware that there was a warning at the crossing.

'I don't often come down that road. I was travelling fairly slowly and out of the blue saw the train.

'I slammed on the brakes, but it was coming too fast and hit me. It was quite overwhelming how close I was. I am very thankful to be alive.'

Police were immediately called after the incident, which happened at 7.40pm yesterday, and officers arrived at the scene in just six minutes.

Crash site: Trencreek Road level Crossing in Cornwall. Miss Frampton failed to spot a First Great Western passenger train before she pulled onto the tracks.

Shocked but unhurt: Police arrived at the scene of the crash within 6 minutes, but Miss Frampton will now face questions to establish whether she committed any offences under the Road Traffic Act

The accident happened at the Trencreek Road level crossing on the Newquay to Par branch line, a 21-mile route which links the popular tourist town to the mainline through Cornwall.

A spokesman for Network Rail said the crossing did not have barriers but was controlled automatically.

He said: 'The crossing has no physical barriers but there are flashing lights, signs and an audible klaxon to warn drivers that a train is approaching.

'Tests are currently being carried out but there is no indication that there was any problem with the equipment. It seemed to be in full working order.'

A spokesman for the British Transport Police said Miss Framton will now face questioning by officers to ascertain whether any laws were broken.

He said: 'Officers are investigating the incident and enquiries are on-going today to establish the full circumstances which led up to the collision.

'No one suffered any injuries at the scene.

'The single-carriage train was travelling at low speed and remained upright on the tracks. Only two passengers were on board the train at the time of the collision.

'The driver of the car, a 28-year-old woman, will be spoken to by BTP officers to establish whether any offences have occurred under the Road Traffic Act.

'The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) has been informed.'
