Angels are everywhere during the festive season adorning trees and nativity scenes but there are none quite like Georgia May Jagger in the new advert for Thierry Mugler.

The models goes bra-less in her latest Angel commercial for the fragrance giants with only the perfume bottle to protect her modesty.

In the advert, which is currently being broadcast in cinemas across the UK, she struts towards the camera like she's walking down a catwalk.

Birth of a star: The first shot shows just a silhouette of the model and images of the universe

Flip book: The frame is split into three as images of Georgia's body and legs change

Quick change: The 22-year-old model is seen in a number of different outfits including a sequin blazer

On fire: Flames fill one scene in the advert which is described as 'as explosive as the iconic fragrance'

The first shot shows just the silhouette of her figure with images on the universe projected on it. 

The frame is then divided into the three - like in a children's flip book where the image can be changed to show a different bodies or legs.

In the Angel ad, Georgina's head always remains but the pictures of her body and legs change to show her in different outfits including a glittery blazer and a gold dress.

At times, the visuals are artistic and futuristic showing her surrounded by the universe, flames or smoke in the shape of angels wings fanning behind her.

The final shot shows her in just leather trousers holding the perfume bottle with the slogan 'beware of angels'.

Angel effect reinvented: Many of the looks are futuristic 

Grew up with the brand: The model said she was honoured to be a part of the campaign like her mother

After seeing the finished result, Georgia said: 'It is amazing and very different from previous campaigns. It represents a very modern idea of femininity.' 

It's certainly an edgier advert to those involving Georgia's mother Jerry Hall, now 58, who was the face of the scent between 1995 to 1997.

In one of her adverts for the brand, she was pictured lying in the desert in a glittery ballgown.

Georgina, 22, said she was delighted to be following in her mother's footsteps when it was announced that she was the new face of Angel earlier this year.

She said on Instagram at the time: 'So honoured to be the new face of Angel fragrance by #ThierryMugler 19 years after my mother.'

She added in an interview with Vogue that she grew up the the fragrance thanks to her mother's involvement with it.

She said: 'My mother was a muse of Mugler and appeared regularly in his Paris runway shows. I have such wonderful memories of the fragrance and my mother's involvement with the Mugler brand.

'It's very special to me to be following in my mother's footsteps.'

Angelic: Jerry Hall in her campaign for the brand in the Nineties

Explaining the idea behind the latest advert, the Thierry Mugler website states: 'The new Angel campaign is as explosive as the iconic fragrance. It is the "Angel effect" reinvented. 

'Born from the explosion of a star, the fragrance trail that remains forms the shape of a woman, an angel. 

'Chic, seductive and ultra-feminine, she asserts herself with determination and confidence. She is mesmerising and triumphant. In her hands she holds her star, her fragrance.'

It adds: 'Georgia introduces a new era in the story of Angel and was quite an obvious choice as her mother Jerry Hall already has a close connection to the brand.'
