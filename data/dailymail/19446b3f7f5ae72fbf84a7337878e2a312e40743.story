Britain's state pension bill is set to quadruple by the mid-2060s, official figures show.

The ballooning cost of paying the basic state pension will soon be larger than the entire economic output of countries such as Austria, Thailand or the UAE.

Predictions by the Department for Work and Pensions say the bill will double from £98billion this year to £179billion in 20 years – and quadruple to £420billion by 2063-64.

The cost will equate to 7.7 per cent of Britain’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 50 years, compared with 5.8 per cent today.

Experts said the escalating bill was a ‘ticking time-bomb’ and presented the government with ‘serious questions’ over how taxpayers would fund it.

They claimed that successive governments had failed to plan for Britain’s ageing population, and that simply pushing back the State pension age would not be enough.

The number of people receiving the State pension will increase from almost 13million today to nearly 17million in 2034 as Britain’s baby boomers reach retirement.

Rising life expectancy also means the average time spent in retirement is now 26 years for a woman and 22 years for a man.

The financial implications of this, combined with the cost of a more generous State pension, has seen the total bill sky-rocket.

The ‘triple lock’ on State pensions – introduced two years ago – will cost an additional £45bn alone in the next 15 years, according to estimates.

The lock guarantees price rises in line with earnings, inflation or 2.5 per cent – whichever is the highest – to protect pensioners from paltry increases.

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Britain’s pensions bill represents a ticking time-bomb, and the only way politicians can defuse it is by making some tough decisions regarding the retirement age, whether the ‘triple-lock’ is sustainable, and how much they can save in other areas.

‘These pension debts are hidden away off the Government’s balance sheet, but the consequences will be all too obvious for the next generation unless something is done.’

Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘Where is the money going to come from? Health? Defence? Policing? It will present some potentially tough choices.

‘The fact that as a nation we are living longer means we will need a retirement income for longer – and this is one of the factors behind the projected growth in the future cost of the State Pension.’

Official statistics show one in three babies born last year will live to celebrate their 100th birthday, as Briton’s life expectancy continues to rapidly improve with advances in healthcare.

The average life expectancy in the UK is currently 79 years for men and 83 for women.

Ros Altmann, the government’s business champion for older workers, said further rises in the State pension age would not be enough to solve Britain’s dilemma over how to fund such an enormous bill.

She said: ‘None of this should come as a surprise to politicians because the demographics have been in place for decades.

‘We should have been prepared for it and yet the State pension remains completely un-funded. It is case of ‘pay-as–you-go – or pray-as-you-go, more like.

‘For decades, we have made all these promises and just hoped that the next generation can afford to pay for it.

‘Part of the solution must be that people to work for longer, which raises more in tax revenue and make it more affordable. But employers need to offer more flexible, part-time work if this is going to happen.’

This week, the government announced a new target for the average retirement age to rise by six months every year.

This is not a policy, but merely a change the government is hoping will occur.

Even the Department for Work and Pensions itself seemed unsure this could be achieved, however, saying it would ‘not normally expect’ such a ‘meaningful’ change in such a short time.

The government hopes that if people choose to work for longer, it will not only boost their pension pots but help to fund healthcare and care home costs for an increasingly elderly population, through increased tax revenue.

Admitting it was an ‘ambitious’ target, Steve Webb, the Liberal Democrat pensions minister, said: ‘What we are doing is catching up with decades of longer living.

‘We are living longer but the labour market and people’s retirement age has not been keeping up.’

The government wants the average retirement age to keep up with State pension age, which will increase to 66 by 2020 for both men and women. It will then continue to rise in line with life expectancy.

Dr Altmann criticised the government target last night, saying it was unrealistic for retirement age to rise by six months every year.

She said: ‘If it continued at that rate, it would reach 80 in 30 years. It is not sustainable.

‘I do not think the government should be aiming for any ‘magic age’ at which people should retire.

‘They should recognise individual differences and choices which enable one person to work until their 80s while others may be genuinely ill and unable to continue beyond their 60s.

‘The general direction of travel is towards later retirement but it is dangerous to put a figure on it.’

A DWP spokesman said: ‘Older people have worked hard and paid into the system all their lives. That is why our reforms are securing the long-term future of the State Pension – so it remains strong and keeps pace with increasing life expectancy.’
