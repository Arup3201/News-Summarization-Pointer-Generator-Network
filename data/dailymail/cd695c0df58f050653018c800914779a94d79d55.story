A nine-year-old schoolgirl who has never so much as trimmed her hair has chopped off all her locks and donated the resulting 17inch ponytail to a cancer wig charity.

Xanthe Coote, from Portsmouth, Hants, decided she wanted to
help young cancer victims who have lost their hair to chemotherapy, after
a family friend was diagnosed with the deadly disease.

The real-life Rapunzel also raised a staggering £666 for Portsmouth-based children’s hospice Naomi House - an especially impressive amount since her initial target was just £50.

Xanthe said: 'It feels a bit weird because my head feels a lot lighter and it is easier to brush and wash my hair.

'I decided I wanted to donate my hair because one of my friends got cancer and had all her hair taken off.

'She explained to me what it felt like, and I decided to help all the other children who might be going through the same thing.'

Proud
mum Anjella Corr, 40, said: 'Xanthe has grown her hair all her life -
she has never had it cut. I guess like most little girls she liked to 
have long hair.

'But then one 
day she came home and said she wanted to have it all cut off because her
friend had a haircut. She also decided she wanted to give her hair 
away.

'She knows a family 
friend, whose daughter had cancer and needed a wig. Even though they do 
not know each other too well she wanted to help other people like her.

'She
is the youngest of four and she has always been very altruistic. It is 
in her nature to be so giving and I am immensely proud of her.'

Xanthe's new goal is to regrow her hair and cut it all off once more to help those in need.

Monica Glass, spokesperson for Little Princess Trust, who make the wigs, said: 'The Little Princess Trust is very grateful to Xanthe for her kind hair donation.

'Support such as this helps us to continue to provide real-hair wigs to boys and girls across the UK and Ireland, that have sadly lost their own hair through cancer treatment.

'It is always particularly poignant when one child decides to help another and for this we sincerely thank Xanthe.

'We would also like to extend our thanks to her family.'
