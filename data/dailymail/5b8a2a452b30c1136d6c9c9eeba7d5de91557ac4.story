This is the incredible moment a passing doctor was able to save a stranger's life after he crashed into the back of a lorry on a motorbike.

Praewa Mitrakul, 30, a medical lecturer at Mahudol University in Bangkok, Thailand, was making her way home from work when she saw motorcyclist Akara Yamnam slam into the truck.

The 33-year-old went flying through the windscreen, which shattered and sliced open his neck, as Dr Mitrakul stopped her car, ran over and began giving emergency first aid.

The doctor and medical university lecturer was passing by when she witnessed the crash and rushed to help

The moment was captured on a mobile phone by Yingyot Srinakarn, and shows the blood-soaked ground as the medic tries to stop the flow from his gaping neck wound.

Mr Srinakarn, 27,  said: 'She was very calm and knew exactly what she was doing. She whipped off her cardigan and used it as a pad to cover the wound and stem the flow of blood.

'The ground was covered in blood and broken glass but she stayed by him despite cutting her own knees. If she hadn't stopped to help I am sure he would not have survived.

'She truly was his guardian angel.'

The doctor stayed with him until emergency services arrived around 10 minutes later to take him to hospital. 

The video was uploaded to social media where it quickly went viral with people praising the woman for her quick actions.

Paul Saunter posted: 'Hope the guy will recover soon. All my respect to this lady. The right person at the right place in the right moment.'

Sanguan Hiranyasap wrote: 'This is a true angel on earth.'

While Apasiri Wongpuapun said: 'Extraordinary woman. People like this should be given the highest honours in the land. A true priestess.'

Dr Mitrakul later told local media: ‘I saw the accident had just occurred so I had the chance of saving and I am glad I helped save one.

'I just did what I had to do. He needed help and luckily I was there for him.'

It is reportedly the third time the doctor has stepped in and help save a stranger, according to Press Reader.
