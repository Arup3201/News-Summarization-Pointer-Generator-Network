It could be any ordinary teenage boy joking around for his friends' amusement.

But the laughing teenager seen dancing in this video is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev - the younger of the two Chechen brothers believed to have been behind the fatal bombings that devastated Boston less than three weeks ago.

The footage filmed at a summer wrestling camp shows the now 19-year-old suspect performing a robot dance for the camera as his friends practice on the mats behind him.

The opening caption at the start of the video, which surfaced online, reads: 'This was the Jahar I knew'.

It shows two boys wrestling on mats as loud hip hop music plays in the background, before Tsarnaev suddenly comes into view and breaks into a series of dance moves.

The 19-year-old, who is being held at a federal medical detention centre in central Massachusetts, is seen sliding his feet across the mat and performing a string of robotic manoeuvres before turning to face the camera and dissolving into laughter.

The video goes onto show him engaged in a practice wrestling bout with one of his friends.

The pair are seen grappling for several seconds, before Tsarnaev apparently overpowers his opponent.

The teenager has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction during the Boston Marathon on Monday April 15.

Twin explosions close to the finish line of the marathon on Boylston Street killed three and left more than 260 injured.

An enormous manhunt launched in the 
wake of the atrocity ended in a police chase in which Dzhokhar was 
seriously wounded, and his older brother and fellow suspect Tamerlan 
Tsarnaev was killed.

The 19-year-old was released from 
hospital last Friday and is now being held in a small cell with a solid 
steel daughter at the Ayer facility in Massachusetts.

Earlier this week it emerged that prominent anti-death penalty lawyer Judy Clarke has joined his defence team.
