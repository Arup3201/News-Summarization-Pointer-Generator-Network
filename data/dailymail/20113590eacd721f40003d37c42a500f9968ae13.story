Fireworks have exploded at CNN after new boss Jeff Zucker hired and fired six big names in his first two days in the job.

The first departure was political power couple James Carville, the veteran political analyst, and his wife Mary Matalin, who have been with CNN since 2005.

CNN network's managing editor Mark Whitaker then announced that he was going to quit as it emerged ABC's Chris Cuomo was coming over to start a new morning show.

RedState's Erick Erickson will also be leaving and will reportedly be heading to Fox News, which recently fired Sarah Palin.

Shake-up: CNN's new boss Jeff Zucker, pictured left, has hired and fired six big names in his first two days in the job. However, the former editor of Britain's Daily Mirror, Piers Morgan, right, will keep his job

But perhaps the biggest news of all is that the voice of James Earl Jones will once again speak the 'This is CNN' greeting.

The Oscar nominee and voice of Darth Vader has not been featured on the network for years but Zucker asked that it be brought back on Monday to coincide with President Obama's inauguration - also his first day in the job.

It also appears that the former editor of Britain's Daily Mirror, Piers Morgan, will remain in his position as host of Piers Morgan Tonight, which he began hosting on 17 January 2011.

The changes show just how serious Zucker is about turning CNN around, but for so much to happen so soon has raised eyebrows.

His actions also leave huge questions over others whose fate rests in his hands, namely Ann Curry who wants to leave NBC for CNN.

Another who will be feeling anxious is Soledad O'Brien, who currently hosts the CNN morning show 'Starting Point,' which has struggled in the ratings despite being critically applauded.

Co-anchors: Chris Cuomo, left, will reportedly be paired with Erin Burnett, right, who currently hosts her prime time CNN show 'OutFront'

O'Brien faces being ousted for Cuomo 
who will reportedly be paired with Erin Burnett, who currently hosts her
prime time CNN show 'OutFront.'

Getting
Cuomo, the son of New York governor Andrew Cuomo, is quite a coup for 
CNN as he is a former anchor on ABC's Good Morning America and is 
extremely experienced.

But
O'Brien will now have to renegotiate her role and try to avoid being 
put on the dreaded 'special assignment' duty which will see her 
consigned to graveyard slots and obscurity.

A CNN spokesman said: 'Soledad is very important to the network, and we're discussing various options with her.'

Carver's firing seems less controversial.
He claimed that he was 'completely cool' with being axed and that it 
was to do with the fact he lives in New Orleans and not Washington.

Fate unclear: It's not clear whether Ann Curry, right, will be able to leave NBC for CNN and Soledad O'Brien, right, who currently hosts the CNN morning show 'Starting Point,' could be out

Switch: Erick Erickson, left, is out, but James Earl Jones, right, is rehired for the CNN jingle

He
told Politico: 'I was told that they wanted the contributors to be more
available -- essentially, closer to Washington. I'm not always 
available, I don't live there.'

Matalin told Politico in an email: 'Agree with everything James said.

'I loved my time in and out at CNN and more, the many lifelong friendships made there.'

Whitaker,
a former Newsweek editor, left with a barb and sent out an email to 
staff saying that he stepped aside because Zucker has what he called 
'forceful ideas.'

Gone: CNN's managing editor Mark Whitaker has resigned

He then tried to smooth things over 
and said: 'For him to succeed, I believe he deserves his own team and 
management structure and the freedom to communicate one clear vision to 
the staff.

'I have shared that conclusion with him and he has agreed to let me step down as Managing Editor and move on from CNN.

Zucker
will in fact take over Whitaker's role overseeing editorial content at 
CNN and there will no new managing editor appointed.

Zucker said in a statement: 'I want to thank Mark for his service at CNN. We are grateful for his contributions and wish him the best in the future.'

Right-leaning Erickson has been with CNN since 2010 when he started as a contributor on John King, USA, which has already been axed, before becoming a contributor across the network.

The worst affected by the switch seems to be his daughter and on his RedState blog he wrote: 'When I told my 7 year old I had decided to leave, she laid on the sofa for an hour crying that she'd never see Anderson Cooper again.'

He also wrote that even though he was not an 'easy fit' at CNN and that the first month was 'tumultuous,' he was grateful for the chance to 'learn to be friends with people who I disagreed with.'

Under Zucker's orders, CNN has already lured ABC's Jake Tapper to host an afternoon show on politics and John Berman has been brought in to co-host Early Start from 5am to 7am.

Zucker was hired from NBC to shake up CNN after it suffered its worst rating slump in 21 years last summer.
