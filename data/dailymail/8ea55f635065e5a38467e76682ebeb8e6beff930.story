Devoted: Diana Brittan, whom Leon married aged 41

On the news of Lord Brittan’s death, his one-time Cabinet colleague Lord Debden (formerly John Gummer) said he felt ‘very sad’.

‘A good and honourable servant of his country. A decent and lasting friend. He will be sorely missed. RIP,’ he said.

It did not take long, though, for a very different reaction to emerge.

First, the Labour MP Tom Watson replied to Lord Debden’s tweet with a single word: ‘Hmmm.’ Then another Twitter user publicly added a message declaring Brittan ‘a nasty little pederast’.

Over the next few hours, a torrent of vile abuse was directed, via Twitter, at Lord Brittan. Hundreds of messages, often from people who ‘follow’ Mr Watson on Twitter and at times so obscene as to be unprintable, were sent, accusing the former Tory Home Secretary of having committed a catalogue of appalling sex crimes.

Many expressed glee at his death and hoped that he ‘rots in hell’.

The vehemence of such remarks, often made anonymously, was entirely at odds with the fact that Brittan was never charged with any criminal offence, let alone convicted.

Yet we are living in the internet age, where mob mentality rules, and there is scant regard for traditions of politeness, let alone the old-fashioned notion that a man should be considered innocent until proven guilty.

So it was that Brittan was forced to live out his final years under a black cloud, the subject of seemingly never-ending rumours about his alleged involvement in a paedophile ring, which operated at the heart of the British establishment.

Recent months had, among other things, seen him investigated for supposedly ‘burying’ a dossier detailing VIP child abusers, questioned by police over an alleged rape and accused in Parliament of ‘improper conduct with children’.

Increasingly frail, having spent time in hospital over Christmas 2013, when he was treated for heart trouble and cancer, the old man retreated behind the net curtains of his five-storey home in London’s Pimlico, attended by his loyal wife, Diana, step-daughters Katherine and Victoria, and his 81-year-old brother, Samuel.

His final public statement was, perhaps fittingly, made via Mishcon de Reya, the former lawyers of Diana, Princess of Wales.

Issued last July after a woman claimed he’d raped her during a blind date in 1967, it read: ‘It is true that I have been questioned by the police about a serious allegation made against me. This allegation is wholly without foundation.’

The woman, a Labour Party member, was a 19-year-old student at the time she claims she was assaulted almost 50 years ago.

Downcast: Lord Brittan last year after being questioned by police about serious allegations

We can reveal that she first went to the police in late 2012. But after a lengthy investigation, detectives decided there was insufficient evidence even to question Brittan.

They were forced to reverse that decision last June, however, after Labour’s Tom Watson, who was in contact with the woman, complained about it in a letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions.

Brittan was interviewed under caution, but not arrested. Details of the case were made public only after they were leaked to the Left-wing Independent on Sunday newspaper.

A file was subsequently passed to the Crown Prosecution Service. But there was insufficient evidence for any hope of securing a conviction and no charges were filed.

Nonetheless, the rumour mill —mostly, it seems, politically motivated — continued to churn.

Watson was often at its centre, as the man originally responsible for kick-starting the wider scandal in which Brittan became embroiled.

It had begun in October 2012, when the campaigning Labour MP made an extraordinary speech in the Commons asking David Cameron about claims of a ‘powerful paedophile network linked to Parliament and No 10’.

Three months later, Scotland Yard launched Operation Fernbridge, an investigation into a VIP paedophile ring said to have included a number of prominent figures, which had operated at the Elm Guest House, a gay brothel in Barnes, South-West London, in the Eighties.

As part of the inquiry, detectives raided a property in central London and took away a number of documents that purported to name a string of prominent visitors to the address, including two pop stars, a royal servant, an MI5 officer, Soviet traitor Anthony Blunt and Liberal MP Cyril Smith (posthumously exposed as a child abuser).

But is it really credible that a senior minister, with 24-hour Special Branch protection, could slip his security cordon and carry out child sex abuse?

Yet, in cyberspace, dozens of websites sprang up alleging that Brittan was guilty of a string of sex crimes over several years.

Invariably, such claims were (and remain) unsupported by fact. The websites cannot, for example, find victims prepared to testify on the record or produce documentary evidence that has anything approaching a reliable provenance.

Occasionally, lurid reports have spilled over into the mainstream Press. In late 2013, for example, the Sunday Mirror claimed that an unnamed ‘former Tory Cabinet minister’ had been photographed and filmed at a ‘depraved orgy organised by a paedophile’.

The police had copies of the pictures and video, the article suggested, and would shortly be questioning the former minister.

Yet no such interview is believed to have taken place. No arrests were made, and no charges filed — which, on the face of it, would seem unlikely if such damning pictures exist.

Another wild allegation circulating online — and reported by the Daily Telegraph — is that while serving as a Cabinet minister, a Tory was once arrested by Customs officials for smuggling child pornography in his luggage.

You can look in vain for evidence to support this outlandish charge.

Dark cloud: Rumours about Brittan were circulating around Westminster from the earliest days of his career. Above, Lord Brittan with Margaret Thatcher

One thing we know for sure, meanwhile, is that in 1984 Brittan was, as Home Secretary, handed a ‘dossier’ alleging the existence of a paedophile ring at Westminster by the late Tory MP, Geoffrey Dickens.

The dossier later disappeared, prompting endless rumours that Brittan presided over its cover-up.

Though he initially denied ever having seen the documents, last year he made a formal statement to the effect that he had passed Dickens’s dossier to officials.

‘I do not recall being contacted further about these matters by Home Office officials, by Mr Dickens or by anyone else,’ he said.

The fate of that dossier is one of many issues due to be investigated by the Government’s inquiry into historic sex abuse, if it ever gets off the ground. Indeed, its existence led to the resignation in October of inquiry chair Fiona Woolf, after it emerged that she had a personal friendship with Brittan’s wife.

Largely lost in that controversy, however, was a pertinent fact: if Brittan had been part of the Westminster paedophile ring laid bare by the ‘dossier’, why would Dickens hand that dossier to him?

Dark rumours about Brittan were, it must be noted, circulating around Westminster from the earliest days of his career.

A single man when he entered Parliament in 1974, he had no known girlfriends before marrying aged 41.

In 1984, Brittan was at the centre of another poisonous rumour during which several newspapers reported that an unnamed frontbencher was a predatory paedophile.

The so-called ‘Cabinet Minister Scandal’ died down when the investigative journalist Paul Foot published an article in Private Eye that named Brittan and said untrue rumours had been circulating ‘around in Fleet Street’ about him for some time.

After lengthy investigations, several newspapers, including the News of the World, had concluded there was nothing in them.

Private Eye said the rumours were a smear circulated by MI5 officers who had targeted Brittan because they were upset by reports claiming he was planning a ‘big shake-up’ of their operations following the fatal shooting of WPC Yvonne Fletcher outside the Libyan Embassy.

There was also prejudice against Brittan because of his Jewish faith. Private Eye concluded: ‘The MI5 spooks and loonies who object to having a Jewish Home Secretary . . . [have] retaliated by resurrecting the Brittan smear and spreading it around the Street of Shame.’

Thirty years on, such smears refuse to go away — and have been lent oxygen by the internet.

To add to Brittan’s pain in his final months, Labour MP Jim Hood used Commons privilege (which protects MPs from libel) last October to accuse him of ‘improper conduct with children’ during the miners’ strike. Mr Hood cited no evidence in support of such claims.

Throughout this barrage of allegations, one may wonder: why haven’t all the victims come forward to testify to Brittan’s guilt? The fact is they have largely been conspicuous by their absence.
