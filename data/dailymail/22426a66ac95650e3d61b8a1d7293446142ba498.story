Laura Jane Thomas, 20, was killed when a lorry driver crashed into her as he looked at pornography

A lorry driver who killed a young bride-to-be while looking at pornography on his phone has been jailed for just five years.

Ian Glover, 44, was flicking through pictures of women on an explicit dating website when his 44-ton Mercedes ploughed into a parked car.

Teaching assistant Laura Jane Thomas, 20, and her fiance Lewis Pagett, 19, had broken down and pulled on to a grass verge with their hazard lights on.

The childhood sweethearts, who had 
been together since the age of 13, got out and were standing behind a 
safety barrier when Glover ploughed into their Vauxhall on the A5 
between Telford and Shrewsbury in Shropshire.

As a result of the smash, the car flew over the barrier, killing Miss Thomas while her fiance was on the phone to his father.

Glover,
 who had worked as a driver for Sainsbury’s for ten years, admitted 
causing death by dangerous driving and causing serious injury by 
dangerous driving. He was jailed for just five years at Shrewsbury Crown
 Court on Friday.

Miss
 Thomas’s mother, Lisa, spoke last night of her outrage at the short 
sentence. She said Glover should have been jailed for 14 years, the 
maximum sentence for death by dangerous driving.

‘A five-year sentence for killing our 
beautiful daughter is just not enough in our eyes,’ she said. ‘What is 
worse is he could get a shorter sentence if he’s well behaved.

The crash happened when Miss Thomas and her fiancé Lewis Pagett, pictured above, broke down at the side of the road. They were standing behind a safety barrier when the lorry careered into their parked car

‘Laura had lived just a quarter of her life and he could be out of prison in two years or so – it’s just not fair.’ 

The 45-year-old added: ‘I makes me 
feel sick that Glover killed my girl while looking  at porn. I keep 
getting  flashbacks of seeing her in hospital and the sheer despair of 
losing her.’

Speaking after
 the court case, Mr Pagett, who was left with a head injury and 
fractured vertebrae, said: ‘Laura and I were looking forward to planning
 our wedding together – instead, I ended up planning her funeral.

‘We were so excited to spend the rest of our lives together.

‘Laura had so much life to give, she had a heart of gold and aimed to become a teacher for disabled children.’

He said the couple were on their way 
to Aberystwyth for a week by the sea. ‘I had to put my hazard lights on 
and call my dad,’ he added.

Laura and her fiancé Lewis Pagett were standing by their stationary vehicle on the A5, one section pictured, when the driver crashed into it. The vehicle flew over the safety barrier - killing the young teaching assistant

‘One minute we were standing over the safety barrier on the A5 then the next thing I remember is being on the floor in a heap of rubble.’

Sentencing Glover, Judge Robin Onions said: ‘You were on these sites at the  point of impact. For many miles you were not paying  proper attention. This was  utterly avoidable.’

The court heard Glover, of Birmingham, was travelling at between 50mph and 56mph when he hit the Vauxhall at 8.20am on July 21 last year.

He told police that he could not remember what had happened before the crash.

But tests on three mobile phones found in his lorry revealed that he was looking at the explicit dating sites.

Prosecutor Hugh O’Brien Quinn said: ‘Mr Glover said that the only distraction in his car was the radio.

‘But two of the three phones found showed one site had been used while moving more than ten times, including while on the M54 and the A5.

‘It was a clear day and the Vauxhall would’ve been visible for a quarter of a mile but the defendant did not see it at all and drove straight into it.’ Defending Glover, Paul Rogers said he was ‘deeply ashamed’.

Miss Thomas, of Great Haywood in Staffordshire, had become engaged at Christmas in 2012 and dreamed of having her wedding reception at the same venue where her school prom was staged. She was a teaching assistant at Marshlands Special School and volunteered with the Riding for the Disabled Association.
