Disgraced ex-Tory communications chief Andy Coulson will be freed from prison on Friday – after serving less than five months of an 18-month sentence for hacking.

The ex-News of the World editor will be made to wear an electronic tag as a condition of his early release, which is around 130 days before his jail term reaches even the halfway stage.

Coulson was jailed on July 4 after he was convicted of conspiracy to hack phones.

A senior judge at the Old Bailey said that he had to take a ‘major share of the blame’ for the phone hacking at the now defunct tabloid newspaper, in which the voicemails of thousands of victims were unlawfully accessed.

The victims included celebrities, politicians, the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler and members of the royal family,

Coulson, 46, initially spent two months in Category A Belmarsh prison, in south London, alongside terrorists and other dangerous inmates – longer than is usual for a crime such as hacking.

He was then moved to Hollesley Bay, a minimum security jail in Suffolk. 

When the shamed Tory MP Jeffrey Archer was imprisoned there for perverting the course of justice, the NOTW called it a ‘holiday camp’.

His sentence has been calculated under a complicated set of rules known as the Home Detention Curfew Scheme.

This allows non-violent inmates sentenced to 18 months or more to spend the last 135 days or less at home, wearing a tag.

In Coulson’s case, his 18-month sentence was halved – as happens in all bar the most serious cases - then had the further reduction made under HDC rules.

However, his ordeal will not be at an end when he leaves open prison.

In August, prosecutors in Scotland announced he faces a series of perjury charges over the Tommy Sheridan trial.

Coulson is alleged to have lied while giving evidence at the trial in December 2010.

He is accused of knowing there was a culture of phone hacking at the News of the World while he was editor but denying it while on oath.

Following his conviction in July, the Prime Minister apologised for hiring Coulson as a Tory spin doctor and, later, the communications chief at Number Ten.

David Cameron said it was “the wrong decision”.
