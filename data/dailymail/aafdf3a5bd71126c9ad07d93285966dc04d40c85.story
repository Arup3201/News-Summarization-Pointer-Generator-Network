He's been hampered by injury problems at the start of the season but that hasn't stopped Daniel Sturridge trying to make children become healthy.

The 25-year-old has become an ambassador of Sainsbury's Active Kids 2015 campaign alongside Paralympic gold medalists Ellie Simmonds and Jonnie Peacock.

The initiative aims to inspire children to lead healthier lifestyles whether that be through sport or their diets.

Sainsbury's Active Kids programme has donated £150million worth of sports and cooking equipment since the scheme began in 2005, and now has over 53,000 schools and organisations registered. 

It's not the first time that supermarket brand and Sturridge have formed a partnership.

Earlier in October, Sturridge posted a picture on Instagram of him at a Sainsbury's checkout with the message: 'Late night shop... What's everyone's fave food?'

The supermarket was Sturridge's choice of night spot as the Liverpool striker, recovering from a thigh problem, stocked up on some healthy foods.

Sturridge hasn't featured for his club since August, making just three Premier League appearances before getting injured on England duty.

In his absence the Anfield outfit have struggled domestically and in Europe with Reds boss Brendan Rodgers desperate for him to overcome his injury.

Sturridge scored 22 Premier League goals for the Merseysiders last season and and Rodgers is keen to get the forward back in the team and scoring.

'Top players have such an influence on the team,' said Rodgers. 'When you are under the cosh, you know that you have strikers who can score out of nothing.

'When you have that as a team, it is a big weapon. Sturridge is one of them. That is where we aim to get with Daniel.'

Despite missing the last two months of the season, the Liverpool boss is confident Sturridge will be firing on all cylinders when he makes his comeback.

'When he comes back into the team, you will see the confidence because of the movement and the dynamic. But he isn’t fit and he hasn’t been for a long time,' he added.
