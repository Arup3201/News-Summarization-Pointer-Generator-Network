Ms Walker said Mrs Montgomery also had a son, 28-year-old Mark, and was 'happily married' for 13 years.

She was due to fly to Tenerife next month to meet up with relatives living on the island in the Canaries. 

Another friend, 50-year-old Hannah Davies, had known Mrs Montgomery since their days at Tamworth's Belgrave Comprehensive School.

'She would do anything for anyone and was one of the world's truly genuine people,' said Ms Davies.

'There was always a smile on her face and a hug in her arms and nothing was ever too much trouble for her.

'We always laughed and put the world to rights whenever we were together.

'She was one of the most down-to-earth people I knew, a real family person and so close and supportive to so many people.

'I know she will be badly missed by so many people. Everyone who knew Tina has lost someone very, very special.'

Mrs Montgomery worked at the Cut Hut hair salon in Glascote Heath, Tamworth.
