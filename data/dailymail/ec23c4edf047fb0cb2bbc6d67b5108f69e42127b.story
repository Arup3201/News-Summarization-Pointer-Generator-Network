Neighbours complained after My Heart Will Go On by Celine Dion (pictured) was blasted out by Gareth Davies at his home in Strood, Kent

A music fan had his speakers seized for the third time because he refused to stop playing Celine Dion's classic ballad My Heart Will Go On.

Gareth Davies had his belongings confiscated for the first time in March last year after neighbours complained, a court heard.

Thousands of pounds worth of equipment including a 3D TV, sound docking station and 32 DVDs were taken by council officers from his home in Strood, Kent.

But the 48-year-old didn't take the hint and just two months later council workers had to return. 

Davies  was fined for seven breaches of a noise abatement notice at  Dartford Magistrates' Court yesterday.

He was told his equipment would be permanently forfeited and was fined £50 for each charge. He will also pay £500 costs.

After his equipment was confiscated last June, Davies, who has been living in his £80,000 Victorian terraced house since 1988, said he would never speak to his neighbours again.

The former window salesman said: 'I'm constantly wondering about the noise now.

'This hasn't solved anything. I'm not going to be able to talk to my neighbours again.

'The thing that surprised me the most, considering I have a 2,000-watt amp, is that they complained about my little Bose docking station. 

The 48-year-old first had his speakers confiscated in March last year. At the time he said: 'This hasn't solved anything. I'm not going to be able to talk to my neighbours again'

Davies' favourite was made famous in the 1997 film Titanic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet

‘I don't understand why the council has changed its policy on this issue. That's why I ignored the notice - I thought I'd get the chance to defend myself.

‘It felt like it was a witch hunt. 

'There's all sorts of things that make sounds - this is ridiculous.’ 

Songs on Davies' playlist included James Brown's Sex Machine, Apache Indian's Boom Shack A Lack and Steppenwolf's Born To Be Wild.

Other favourites were The Boy With The Thorn In His Side by The Smiths, Ice Cold by Vanilla Ice and You've Got A Friend In Me from the 1995 film Toy Story. 

Cllr Peter Hicks, Medway Council's Portfolio Holder for Community Safety, said: 'This man was a nuisance to his neighbours and now he has been hit hard in the pocket.

'People have the right to lead a peaceful existence in their own homes and this case sends out the message that anti-social behaviour of this sort will not be tolerated.'
