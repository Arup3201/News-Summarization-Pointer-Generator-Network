Good news for those who feared the weekend’s glorious weather would disappear as soon as it arrived - the beautiful sunshine is now expected to last until at least Friday.

The Met Office predicted highs of up to 21C across the country today and the mercury will hit 23 tomorrow - matching yesterday's hottest day of the year so far.

But forecasters predict the the warm spell will end on Saturday - just in time for the school Easter holidays.

Although, despite temperatures dropping to 12, there is still little sign of any rain - prompting new drought warnings.Temperatures are likely to pick up mid-week, but only as high as 16C.

It comes after almost a week of unseasonably warm and sunny weather. Amazingly, rather than the south of England, it was the Scottish village of Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, which recorded the highest temperature of the year so far as the mercury hit 22.9.

South of the border Otterbourne in 
Hampshire was the warmest place on Monday, peaking at 21.4C, while 
Porthmadog in Wales reached 21.1C. Meanwhile central London saw 
temperatures of 19C.

The first working day of the week saw
 Britain's beaches and parks fill up with sun seekers as forecasters 
said the heatwave was due to high pressure and breezes from north Africa
 and the Mediterranean.

Clear blue skies with dry, sunny 
weather is anticipated for most of the UK on Wednesday and Thursday. 
Early mist and fog on Friday is expected to clear to make way for 
another beautiful day. Only western parts of Scotland will see some less
 enjoyable conditions in the shape of breezes  and patchy drizzle.

But forecasters urged sun-worshippers to 
make the most of it because by the weekend temperatures will be back to a
 more seasonal average of 11-12C (51-53F).

They predict chilly starts followed by sunshine and highs of 21C in both the North and the South over the next few days.

Rebecca Sherwin, a Met Office forecaster, said: ‘The weather is reasonably unusual for this time of year.

‘We’ve
 got high pressure sat over the UK at the moment, causing very settled 
weather. It means the day warms up very quickly in the morning.’

The dry conditions meant fire 
services across Scotland had to deal with a number of grass
 fires and the Highlands & Islands Fire & Rescue department are warning people not to burn garden waste or rubbish.

But it wasn't just people who lapped 
up the hot weather. Daffodil the spring piglet enjoyed a snuffle around 
the flowers at West Lodge Rural Centre in Desborough, Northants.

Daffodil and her siblings, Pinky and 
Perky, were born last Monday and have been a star attraction at the centre, which attracted 12,000 visitors this weekend.

Farm manager Ryan Thompson, 36, said: 'When people see the pigs they fall in love with them and want to take them home.

'But when I show them 60-stone Boris to remind them what the piglets will become, they change their minds.'

Heathrow too is expecting a lively 
period. It anticipates that the next seven days will be the busiest of 
the year with more than 1.6 million passengers expected to pass through 
its doors in the first week of the Easter school holidays alone (Friday 
30 March to Friday 6 April).

Friday March 30 is predicted to be 
the airport's busiest day with over 220,000 people heading home or 
jetting abroad for last minute skiing or guaranteed sunshine over the 
Easter weekend.

A total of 3.4 million passengers  
will pass through the five terminals during the two week school break 
(30 March to 15 April) and additional staff are being rostered on to 
help passengers, while dedicated family lanes and pre-flight play areas 
will cater for the thousands of families flying this holiday.

There will be special appearances by 
Peter Rabbit, chocolate Easter treats and activity books plus Kids Eat 
Free deals in many of Heathrow’s restaurants.

While this weekend’s warm spell was good news for many, it will add to fears of droughts this summer.

The dry weather has also caused some 
major forest fires across the country with firefighters warning the 
parched countryside is fast becoming a tinderbox waiting to explode into
 flames.

In the latest incident, exhausted 
crews said this morning the had won their fight to control flames 
sweeping across the beautiful Ashdown Forest in Sussex.

More than fifty acres of woodland 
ignited in the Kings Standing area near Brighton yesterday. It took 
eight fire engines plus six Land Rovers from East Sussex Fire and Rescue
 to tackle the blaze.

It broke out at around 1.45pm as hundreds of families descended on the forest to enjoy picnics and rambles.

Thick black smoke was seen rising from the woods where it’s feared countless birds’ nests have been destroyed.

With the spring breeding season in 
full swing, eggs and chicks in the nests would have had no chance 
against the advancing wall of flames.

The fire service is now warning people not
 to light barbecues for picnics, throw away cigarette ends or even leave
 bottles and glasses where they can magnify the sun’s rays.

The current hot weather has seen an 
increasing number of woodland and heath fires - there was another huge 
blaze near Poole in Dorset over the weekend.

Hampshire Police said two teenagers 
were arrested after five acres of wildlife-rich heathland near 
Fordingbridge went up in flames last week.

Meanwhile
 thousands of fish are being removed from a stretch of water in 
Cambridgeshire after water levels dropped significantly.

The
 Environment Agency is rescuing fish from the 9km long Maxey Cut which 
runs between Peterborough and Market Deeping in Lincolnshire.

The fish, which include chub, pike and sea trout, will then be released into the River Welland.Low
 rainfall and two dry winters in a row have caused 'exceptionally low' 
river flows, according to a spokesman for the Environment Agency.

David
 Hawley, the agency’s northern area drought manager, said the area had 
seen the lowest rainfall on record across Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire
 and parts of Cambridgeshire over the last 16 months.

The rainfall for the period was 600mm to 200mm below average and Britain now faces the worst drought for 30 years.

'The
 Maxey Cut is already showing signs of environmental stress as a result 
of the drought,' he said.

'Taking early action in a controlled manner is
 better for the fish as they will be spawning in April and May. '

But
 it wasn't all bad news.

The combination of soggy summer, mild winter 
and recent warm weather will make this year’s display of spring 
magnolias the most spectacular in living memory, say experts.

The trees are likely to be at their best over the next two or three weeks.

Colin
 Crosbie of the Royal Horticultural Society gardens at Wisley, Surrey, 
said: ‘We were lucky to have a wet warm summer which was great for bud 
formation, followed by a mostly mild winter so the buds weren’t 
damaged.’

And cherry blossom is blooming four weeks earlier in Britain this year thanks to the Spring heat wave.

The
 unusually high temperatures of 21C have helped the beautiful pink and 
white buds open more than a month early all over the country. The 
spectacular blossom, which is usually associated with Easter, is already
 brightening up fields, woodland edges, parks and gardens across the UK 
after a week of sunshine.

Experts
 believe the early blossom could even mean we are in for a bumper cherry
 season as the fruit will have longer to mature and ripen.
