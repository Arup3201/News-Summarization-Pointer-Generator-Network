For most brides-to-be, the biggest challenge when shopping for a wedding dress is finding a style on budget. But for Rebekah Gregory, just standing in the fitting room presented a struggle.

A survivor of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, Rebekah, 27, from Houston, Texas, was left with a severely injured leg. But with her wedding on the horizon, she allowed TLC's Say Yes to the Dress to chart her search for the perfect gown a month before the big day.

Rebekah, who had to have her left leg amputated below the knee last month, relies on crutches throughout the fitting at New York's Kleinfeld Bridal store.

Struggle: 'My biggest challenge is just the physical part of dress fitting and trying to stand up there and balance,' Rebekah says in a clip from the episode

'My biggest challenge is just the physical part of dress fitting and trying to stand up there and balance,' she says. 'Hopefully I do not rip any of Kleinfeld's amazing dresses.'

Fortunately her family is there for support, including her proud mother, Tina Gregory and younger sister Alexandria.

'This whole process has made me emotional but when she stands there in that dress, your focus is not that leg anymore. It's that girl you're so proud of because of the way that she's handled herself through it,' Tina says.

Kleinfeld employees Randy Fenoli and Debbie Asprea present her with three dresses, and she models a $4,899 Kenneth Pool gown for her family.

'I feel beautiful. I love the sweetheart neckline. I love the beading,' she says.

However, not everyone is won over by the dress.

'I love the top, not so much the bottom,' admits Tina.

And Alexandria is an even tougher critic, observing: 'It was beautiful on top and then it just stopped! It looks like they put two dresses together.'

Honest opinion: Rebekah's younger sister Alexandria was a tough critic, voicing her disapproval of the dress

'It makes me kind of sad that my family didn't like the dress that I initially liked. But it's the first dress that I tried on, so we'll continue on,' says Rebekah.

Rebekah married Pete DiMartino in April on a 19th-century estate in Asheville, North Carolina, using a crutch to slowly walk down the aisle in a Sophia Moncelli gown.

The couple had only known each other for about a year when they attended the April 2013 Boston race as spectators, to see Mr DiMartino's mother cross the finish line.

Last month, Rebekah told the Associated Press that she was looking forward to being fitted for a prosthetic leg after having her left leg amputated, having been wheelchair-bound for 18 months.

'The prognosis is great. I chopped off what was holding me back. The prognosis is you'll see me running the Boston Marathon next year,' she said.
