Manchester United are on the verge of signing Marcos Rojo for £16million after the Argentina defender handed in a transfer request at Sporting Lisbon.

Louis van Gaal has been scouring the market for someone to play left-back or central defence after missing out on Thomas Vermaelen, and the Dutchman has decided that Rojo fits the bill.

United have tabled an offer and the 24-year-old has attempted to force the move through by demanding to leave Sporting. It is also understood that he refused to train with his teammates on Tuesday.

Chelsea and Southampton have also been heavily linked with Rojo in recent weeks but he has made it clear that he wants to move to Old Trafford.

The former Estudiantes and Spartak Moscow defender made six appearances for World Cup finalists Argentina in Brazil, and was voted onto the team of the tournament.

United are also believed to have revived their interest in his Argentina teammate Angel Di Maria, who is for sale at Real Madrid, and Ajax’s Daley Blind.

Earlier this week, Blind admitted earlier this week that he would be open to a move. ‘I am happy here in Amsterdam but if there comes another club I will have to think about it and then we will see,’ he said.
