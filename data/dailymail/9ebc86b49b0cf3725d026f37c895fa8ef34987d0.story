These are the extraordinary century-old panoramic pictures taken by British cameramen who risked their lives to gather intelligence during the First World War.

The surveillance images, hailed as some of the most important photographs of the conflict, show never-before-seen views of No Man's Land and important battle sites taken from the trenches of the Western Front.

They were taken at huge risk by fearless cameramen - who would lean out of the trenches with crude glass plate equipment to take the images.

A collection of panoramic images taken by brave Britons gathering intelligence during the First World War has been revealed. These two images show the same view of The Somme at The Hawthorn Ridge 99 years apart. The location was one of the bloodiest of the entire conflict - and on 1 July 1915, thousands of Lancashire Fusiliers were cut down at the spot. Today the landscape shows nothing of the horrors it once witnessed

The images were taken by British cameramen - who risked their lives to take the pictures. This image shows Canadian troops moving through the ruins of the-once beautiful city of Ypres. By the time this photograph was taken in April 1918, the war was nearing its end - evident by the devastation that is depicted

In this behind-the-scenes image, Lieutenant Osbert Crawford and his assistant prepare to take a picture from a front line trench in the Arras sector in France - a hugely difficult task that would have seen them go over the top of the trench. He used a tripod-mounted 5 x 4 inch Panros camera fitted with a telephoto lens to take the shots

At the time, the panoramas were highly classified because of the information they would have given the enemy.

Each was printed with the following warning: 'This panorama is to be kept with as much security as is compatible with full advantage of it being taken by our own troops.'

Some of the photographs show the tranquil countryside in the early days of the war, apparently unspoilt but with the enemy positions carefully marked.

Others graphically portray the obliteration to the landscape and towns after years of bloody attrition.

The images are printed in a new book called Battlefields of the First World War by Peter Barton.

These panoramas show the development of defensive positions at The Somme. The first was taken in May 1915 and shows a simple fortification known as a breastwork - which were usually built on the surface and made from sandbags and wood. The second shows the same scene 18 months later in November 1916 and the dramatic increase in fortifications

This image shows the Hooge sector, one of the most blood-drenched corners of the entire Western Front. The image was taken from the heart of the once sylvan and tranquil Hooge Chateau estate in Spring 1916

This image shows the aftermath of conflict at Passchendaele, Belgium. A long line of soldiers carry duckboards towards new positions and use them to cross the mud and flooded shell craters on the tortured ground

In his foreword, TV historian Richard Holmes says: 'It is wonderful to see these panoramas, unexploited for so long, in print.

'They provide a strong fulcrum for our understanding of the war, for they enable us to link personal accounts and official records to the all-important ground on which battles were fought.

'And, at a human level, they put us eye-deep in hell, looking out across a landscape so familiar to that generation whose endurance and achievement lift my spirits and break my heart.'

This dramatic image shows behind the battle lines during the Third Battle of Ypres in 1917. By this point, the war was about to enter its fourth year and the landscapes were devastated almost beyond recognition

An image dated April 1915 shows Hill 60 - an important landmark near Ypres. The photograph shows how close enemy lines were - with the Germans holding the vital upper ground on Hill 60. It also shows some of the black humour that existed - with one part of the British trenches ironically nicknamed Lovers Lane

This view is the Somme front in July 1915, a year before the hell of what became the worst battle in British military history. It shows pastures virtually unmarked by shelling, with leafy and shady woods and copses and buildings of all kinds still standing
