Conman Waheed Iqbal was seen on CCTV lowering himself onto the ground while holding onto his trolley before fraudulently claiming he had slipped on a bakery bag in Lidl 

After being carted off in a wheelchair, the textile businessman got out of an ambulance on its way to A&E to go back to the store to speak to a manager, Bradford Crown Court heard. 

The following day he complained of vomiting and bleeding, telling medics he had hurt his leg, back and shoulder in the fall. 

After contacting insurers working on behalf of the supermarket and staging a separate accident at a gym where he claimed to have been knocked out by a punching bag, Iqbal put in claims for £10,000 in compensation.

Fraud investigators however uncovered CCTV footage revealing the man's fraudulent behaviour.  

He was sentenced to 10 months in jail, suspended for two years, and ordered to repay thousands of pounds to the supermarket, gym and the NHS. 

Sentencing, Judge Jonathan Rose said: 'You have been described as a fool. You are not a fool, you are a criminal and you have sought to steal, not from insurance companies, but from every decent responsibly person who pays their premiums.' 

He was also sentenced to 280 hours of unpaid community work. 

The 36-year-old called for help and was rushed off in a wheelchair by a group of store workers and shoppers

In May 2012 Iqbal visited Nuffield Health gym in Shipley, west Yorkshire, where he claimed to have been knocked out by a punch bag. 

He put in a claim for £3,800 to the health centre, which was later discovered to be fraudulent by investigators.  

City of London detective Chief Inspector Dave Wood, Head of the Insurance Fraud Enforcement Department, condemned the man's calculated actions. 

'Iqbal targeted this supermarket and gym knowing they would be fully insured and therefore the

perfect victim for his staged accidents and fictitious personal injury claims. 

'To add insult to his bogus injury claims Iqbal also thought nothing of wasting the emergency and health services' time in a bid to get medical records to bolster his claims.'

David Halstead, Fraud Manager at AIG, the company which insures Lidle, added: 'This is an

extremely pleasing result for both AIG and our Insured, and is the result of working closely with the IFED team. AIG takes a tough stance on tackling insurance fraud, which ensures that customers should not have to pay the price for fraudsters through higher premiums.' 

The textile businessman was condemned in court for his actions, being told by a judge that he was not a fool though had played one in a bid to fraudulently obtain compensation money
