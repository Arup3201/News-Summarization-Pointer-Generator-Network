'Pure greed': Pensioner Terence Gatter escaped jail due to ill health

A pensioner who helped steal £1600 from a woman who had been just been killed in a horrible crash has escaped jail.

Pensioner Terence Gatter was driving when his passenger, Marc Kervin saw
a handbag in the road and the pair split the money they found inside.

The court heard that the 66-year-old was ‘motivated by pure greed’ when 
he took the £800 from Sarwari Ashraf’s bag as she lay dead in the middle
of the road just a few feet away.

Gatter, of Sale, pleaded guilty to theft by finding at Manchester 
magistrates court but escaped a jail sentence due to ill health

The court heard he was driving past the scene of the crash when Mr Kervin, spotted the bag.

Kervin ran into the middle of the road to retrieve it and the pair split the £1,600 between them.

The court heard neither was aware of its connection to Mrs Ashraf, who had been hit and killed by a lorry 130ft away.

Because of the theft, it was impossible to identify her, leaving her 
family to make the agonising realisation when they could not find her 
the next day.

District judge Wendy Lloyd said: ‘This was a horrible crime. You and Mr 
Kervin both knew that in taking that bag, its contents and taking the 
cash that you were going to cause great distress to someone.

‘You were both motivated by pure greed. It was cash you wanted. You showed absolutely no pity for your victim.’

Mrs Ashraf, a grandmother, died instantly when she was in collision with
the articulated lorry as it was being driven through the rush hour.

The ensuing impact at 9.54am on March 29 in Longsight, Manchester, 
propelled her handbag and shoes up to 130m from the rest of her body.

The grisly nature of the incident led to ghoulish onlookers taking sick 
pictures of the gruesome scene and posting them on Twitter.

This left her family waiting an agonising 12 hours to find out if their mother and grandmother had been taken from them.

She added: 'She was of Islam faith and it is extremely important that 
the body is buried within 24 hours.

'She said it was only when crime 
stoppers received intelligence that police were led to Kirvin's door 
step.

The judge said she believed Mr Kervin - who was jailed for his part last
month - was the main perpetrator, adding: ‘But for him, I don’t think 
you would have even been part of it.’

Defending, Paul Sumner said Mr Gatter had used the money to pay bills, not luxuries.

It was later found he had used it to pay for £400 council tax and £118 car tax.

He had been in and out of hospital after suffering two strokes and being involved in a hit-and-run himself.

In a previous hearing Gatter said they were driving along and saw a bag 
in the road and simply deduced that a person had left it on the roof of 
their car and drove off.

Gatter initially denied splitting the cash. He told police: 'I'm not 
like that, neither is Marc. There's nothing in my house, I would not 
know about any money.

The CCTV shows that Mr Gatter stopped stopped at the junction Mr Kirvin 
exited and proceeded to pick up the bag and shoes, which had been in the
middle of the junction. By this time the victim had died from her 
injuries.

A purse, disability badge, national insurance number, mobile phone, house keys and around £1,600 cash was inside the handbag.

In a statement, Mrs Ashraf's family said the theft of the bag created a 
prolonged anguish and suffering to them and they even had to change 
their loved-one's house locks.

Mr Gatter’s four-month sentence was suspended by the judge for 12 
months, he was ordered to pay £800 to Mrs Ashraf’s family and £85 costs.
