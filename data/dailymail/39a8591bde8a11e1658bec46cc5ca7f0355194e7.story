Louis van Gaal has claimed he has inherited a 'broken
team' at Manchester United.

The Dutch coach is three weeks away from the start of the
Barclays Premier League season and is hurriedly trying to impose his beliefs
and philosophies on a squad that finished seventh under David Moyes last May.

Asked if he was taking over at Old Trafford at a good time,
Van Gaal said: 'No. I don't agree. I had to follow Bobby Robson at Barcelona the year
after he won three titles and there wasn't a problem.'

Team-mates again? Robin Van Persie was spotted on holiday in Barbados with United target Thomas Vermaelen - did he try to persuade his former Arsenal colleague to switch to Old Trafford this summer?

'When there is success you have a very good squad, and
now I have to follow and the squad was broken I think.

'It is not in balance. It's more difficult to succeed
in a difficult situation than in a fantastic situation.'

Van Gaal also insisted he will not be forced into panic
buys as he settles down in his new job.

The Dutchman hasn't yet looked at his squad fully to assess
his assets, but will not buy for the sake of it.

United have not opened talks with Juventus over Arturo Vidal
but remain keen on Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen and Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman.

Central figur: Van Gaal will utilise Rooney as a No 9 or 10 as he sets out his formation for this season

Van Gaal has opted for a wing-back system against LA Galaxy and Roma, which is more suited to the
players at his disposal in the USA.

And he told Sky Sports: ‘I don’t buy players for the sake of
it. I buy players to improve my selection.

‘First, I must see what I need in all the positions from the
system we shall play and, at this moment, I don’t know for sure.

‘That’s why I chose this system, I can play them all. But (Javier) Hernandez can also play in the
strIker’s position, so can (Danny) Welbeck.

‘Rooney can play at No 10 and No 9 and he tells me he can
also play at No 11 and No 7, but I prefer him at 9 or 10.

‘When you look at the quality of your players – you see
Rooney, Van Persie, Hernandez, Mata, Welbeck, (Marouane) Fellaini, (Ander)
Herrera a lot of players can play this system.

New system: Van Gaal is adamant his current players can adapt to the new 3-5-2 formation

‘So with this system, two strikers can play, the No 10 can
play, two midfielders can play, so the specialists become the wingbacks.’

Van Gaal insists he is not under pressure having taken over
at Old Trafford, because he has experience from previous jobs.

He added: ‘It was not an instant “yes” because I had other
offers also. So I had to think about it.

‘But I chose “yes” because of the big challenge. I have been
at Ajax – the biggest club in the Netherlands – I went to Barcelona – the
biggest club in Spain – and then I go to Bayern Munich, also the number one in
Germany.

‘So when Manchester United came I thought I had to say “yes”.’

As for trying to emulate Sir Alex Ferguson, he says: ‘I highly respect Sir Alex because there is not another
trainer or manager who has won so many titles.

‘I have won a lot of titles but he has won so many with one
club and that is fantastic. So when you compare Sir Alex with me I am very
proud.’
