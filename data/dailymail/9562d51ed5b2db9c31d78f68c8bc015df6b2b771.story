A Wisconsin man had an asthma attack and died Sunday morning, after police stopped the car rushing him to the hospital.

Passenger Casey Kressin, 29, was unresponsive after EMS showed up and took him to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, WEAU reported.

The car he was in was spotted by police  speeding and going past a red light around 2:05am, the Chippewa Falls Police Department said in a release.

'By the time that the officer was able to get close to the vehicle to make a traffic stop, it was probably about a mile later,' Wendy Stelter, the town's Chief of Police, said in an interview with the station.

Incident: The car Kressin was in raced through this traffic light on its way to the hospital

'When the officer made this traffic stop, there was an adult female that exited the driver's side and there was an adult male that exited the passenger's side,' Stelter also said.

The release stated that 'The operator [of the car] yelled to the officer that the man was having an asthma attack and that he needed to get to the emergency room.

'The man knelt down on the pavement near the rear of the stopped vehicle and indicated that he needed his inhaler.'

The police officer contacted an emergency dispatcher, and both the cop and the female driver tended to Kressin before EMS showed up around 2:12am, Chippewa Falls police said. 

Stelter told WEAU 'Just about six minutes later that EMS arrived on scene and um, they then took the patient and transported him to the hospital and he was later pronounced deceased at the - at St. Joseph's Hospital.'

Chippewa Falls police said that there was an autopsy at Ramsey County Medical Center in Minnesota.

'What was probably going on in that officer's mind is that "This man is sitting here and I'going to keep him calm until the ambulance arrives,"' Stelter also said. 'It's just very sad because the officer feels that he did what he should have done and I truly support him in that, and yet the family has lost a family member, obviously, and that's just very sad.'

Emergency: Kressin was transported to St. Joseph's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead

Stelter upheld the officer's choice, and said 'I think the officer made the best decision. It's just so very unfortunate that it's how things fell out.'

WQOW reported Kressin's girlfriend, Leah Hryniewicki, was behind the wheel of the car at the time of the incident. She wrote on Facebook that her daughter Paige was also present.

'we got pulled over the cop's won't let me take him to the hospital by the time the ambulance got there casey was not breathing they did cpr the whole way to the hospital and at the hospital he went into cardiac arrest,' she wrote on Facebook.

She continued 'I miss him so much and I don't understand why God took 'him from us. The pain he went through waiting for that ambulance and the amount of care he didn't get from the cop's and emt I feel there was more that could of been done.'

Hryniewicki had been very upset and her daughter was also one of her passengers, so the officer did not allow her to drive, Stelter told WQOW.
