A 13-year-old girl has been arrested over claims she 'drop-kicked' and punched a three-year-old boy in the toilets of a Nando's restaurant.

Mother Jade Scott, 25, said she has been left 'absolutely devastated' by the alleged attack on her young son, Ralph Cavalli, which occurred in the Rushey Green restaurant in Catford, south east London.

She claims the youngster went to the toilet with his older sister Lily but returned crying and 'with marks on his face' after being attacked by the unnamed teenager.

Jade Scott, 25, said she has been left 'absolutely devastated' by the alleged attack on her young son, Ralph Cavalli (together above), which occurred in the Rushey Green Nando's restaurant in Catford, south east London

She said she asked her two children what had happened and was told by the youngsters that Ralph was 'drop-kicked' – a wrestling move which sees one fighter leap off the floor and kick the other in the chest with both feet.

The children also reported that the youngster was punched in the face by the teenage girl.

Ms Scott, of Rushey Green, Catford, said she reported the incident to police and the girl was arrested. She has since been released on police bail until December pending further enquiries.  

Ms Scott said: 'I just could not believe it.

'I was so angry at first, then I began to cry because I just couldn't understand why someone would do that to my little boy.

'It made me feel degraded to be honest and that I failed him as a mum and let someone violently abuse him. I'm absolutely devastated.'

She said the family visit Nando's regularly and have never had any problems in the past.

She said: 'He's so scared to go to the toilet now, even at home he doesn't like it. He actually won't go to the toilet anywhere now.'

A Met Police spokesman said: 'We can confirm that we were made aware of an incident that took place in the bathroom area of a restaurant at Rushey Green on October 27 at approximately 3.13pm involving a three-year-old boy.

'An allegation of assault was made that occurred against the boy. As a result a 13-year-old girl was arrested for ABH and taken into custody.

'She has been bailed to a date in December pending further enquiries.'
