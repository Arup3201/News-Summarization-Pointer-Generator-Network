Mitt Romney and his wife Ann have received the go-ahead to raze their La Jolla beachfront house and build an 11,000-square-foot mansion.

The California Coastal Commission voted today to allow the couple to demolish the 3,000-square-foot beach house for which they paid $12 million in 2008 in order to build the much larger home.

It is the second time the couple has won permission to build the mansion after a neighbor challenged the original permit for the Romneys' plan for a two-storey home with a 4,500-square-foot basement.

Future construction site: Mitt Romney's beachfront mansion in La Jolla, California, abuts a public beach

More than double: The construction will include a complete destruction of the current home (which has red tiling on the roof) so that it can be rebuilt at nearly triple the size

According to the LA Times, Anthony Ciani claimed the Romneys lied about the size of their land in order to increase the allowable size of their house.

According
 to Ciani, the Romneys included the beach-front area west of their 
seawall, adding 6,000-square feet to their lot size and allowing them to
 build a house 1,000-square-feet bigger than would have been allowed by 
San Diego city guidelines.

Coastal Commission documents state that Ciani also claimed that public beach use was not protected; that the scale of the development would be out of character with its surrounds; and that the home would be threatened by geologic risks, block public access and impact water quality.

The panel voted seven-four in favor of the Romneys.

The LA Times reports that two commissioners, Dayna Bochco and Jana Zimmer, who voted against the project agreed with Ciani, saying the sandy beach shouldn't have been included in the calculation of the home's size.

Zimmer said she was 'flummoxed' and called it a 'huge red flag, and an unacceptable premise.' San Diego’s planning regulations, she said, 'clearly prohibit counting other kinds of unbuildable areas such as canyons and gullies.'

New project: The Romneys plan to build a beachfront mansion in San Diego big enough to accommodate their children and grandchildren

Bochco said the description of the lower level of the house as a basement was misleading.

'If you’re standing on the beach… you are going to see French doors or sliding glass doors of a first floor that they call a "basement." We have to define what we really mean as a "basement" on a hillside lot,' she said.

The 65-year-old former governor is looking to make the home into an 11,000-square-foot house that is more comfortable for the large brood of Romney children and grandchildren

Attorney Matthew Peterson who represents the couple, said the Romneys will begin work on the house in about six months time, and that the project is expected to take between 14 and 16 months.

As a condition of the permit, the Romneys are required to dedicate their beachfront area to public use.

Commissioner Greg Cox told ABC
 the project would be 'very compatible with the development that's in that 
neighborhood.'

'It's not going to be intrusive or blocking the 
views that people have right now,' he said. 'These people have played by
 the rules.'

The 75-year-old house, which has two bedrooms, will be replaced with a two-storey dwelling.

‘They will keep the appearance of the home from the street as a single-story residence. It won't look tall and bulky like some of their immediate neighbor's homes,’ the Romney’s lawyer Matt Peterson told the Union-Times.

The plans reveal that as well as altering the house, the driveway will be relocated.

The existing lap pool and spa at the home, which has a lawn running down the white sand beach, will be retained.

The most outlandish feature of the home will be in the garage, as Mr Romney ordered a $55,000 car elevator so that vehicles can be stored below ground.

During Mitt Romney's 2012 election campaign, the revelation that the plans for the home included such a contraption - which stars such as Britney Spears and Harrison Ford also have - came as a point of ridicule.

'Well, doesn’t everyone need an elevator for their cars? Even if you have to hire a lobbyist to secure it?' quipped Brad Woodhouse, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee.

The La Jolla home, which sits on 0.41 acres, is one of the family’s three homes.

The Romneys' official primary residence is a townhouse outside of Boston. They also own a $10 million vacation home on the shore of Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire.

The couple sold the 6,400-square-foot home in Belmont, Massachusetts where they raised their children, in 2009 for $3.5 million.

In addition, their 9,500-square-foot ski lodge in Deer Valley, Utah, fetched $5.25 million last year.

Changes: The construction plans promise that the exterior of the house will not change dramatically

Mitt and Ann Romney are believed to be worth between $190 million and $264 million. He made much of his fortune as the co-founder of private equity firm Bain Capital.

At a book signing last year, Romney told reporters why he bought his California beachfront house.

'I wanted to be where I could hear the waves,' he said.

'As a boy, we spent summers on Lake Huron and I could hear the crashing waves at night.

'It was one of my favorite things in the world. Being near the water and the waves was something I badly wanted to experience again.'
