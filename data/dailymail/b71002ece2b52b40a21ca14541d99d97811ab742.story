This astonishing sequence of photographs captures the moment a red fox dived vertically through packed snow to catch his prey.

Using his exceptional hearing, the predator targeted a vole scuttling under 2ft of crusted snow in Wyoming, United States.Â 

The fox then jumped 3ft into the air, jack-knifing to get enough speed to break through the dense snow with his nose.

Moments later, he emerged triumphantly with the vole clamped in his jaws.

The dramatic images were captured by photographer Mike Eastman.

'It takes incredible skill and force to be able to break through the ice and land directly on his target,' he said.
