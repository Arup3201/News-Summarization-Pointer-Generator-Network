Virgin Train staff are the latest rail workers to be promised a bonus for working during the Olympic Games.

The unions have brokered a deal for workers at Richard Branson's company to receive a payment of £500, it was announced today.

The move will be seen as the latest attempt by train firms and the Government to bribe workers not to strike during the Olympics after similar deals were struck with London DLR workers and Network Rail.

The Rail Maritime and Transport union said drivers, conductors and other train crew will be entitled to the extra payment.

Bonus: Staff at Virgin Trains will be getting an extra £500 pay for working during the Olympics

Staff will also receive an annual pay rise of 4.6 per cent or £950, whichever is the greater, from April.

Virgin will run some additional train services for the duration of the Games in London this summer, but it is believed all staff will get the bonus.

An RMT circular to staff said: 'In recognition of your agreement to work to these arrangements, all grades that are covered by collective bargaining will receive a one-off taxable lump sum payment of £500 payable on Friday 14th September 2012.'

General secretary Bob Crow said: 'This is another deal that protects our members' standards of living and rewards them for carrying the extra pressure of the Olympics.

'It is also another victory for the RMT's industrial campaigning and organising strategy which has delivered the goods for our members once again.'

The union has struck deals for Olympic payments for workers in several companies including Network Rail, London Overground and Docklands Light Railway, but has yet to agree a figure with London underground.

Thousands of militant Tube workers last month rejected a £500 bonus for doing their jobs during the Olympics.

Union bosses insisted it was not an 'adequate reward' for 14,000 staff including drivers, station and ticket staff,  signallers and engineers.

The RMT was accused of holding London Underground and Olympic chiefs to ransom after talks on the payment ended in disagreement.

Unite is seeking a payment of £500 for thousands of bus workers in the capital.

The proposed bonus for Underground staff would come on top of £1,200 extra already earmarked for 3,500 Tube drivers for working different and longer shifts during the Olympics.

Former Transport Minister Stephen Hammond MP said last month: 'The unions should not hold London to ransom during the Olympics as millions of people struggle during these difficult economic times.'
