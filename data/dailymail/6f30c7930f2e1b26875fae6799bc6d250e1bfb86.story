From skewered politicians to corpsing presenters, Radio 4 listeners probably thought they had heard it all.

Nothing, however, could have prepared them for an episode which will surely go down as one of the most bizarre in broadcasting history - an interview with the ghost of Hercule Poirot.

Just hours after he had breathed his last, the great Belgian detective - played by David Suchet - was back from the dead to be grilled by Today presenter Jim Naughtie.

Confused listeners tuned in to hear the actor, still in character as Poirot, meditate on life, death and how he had died by his own hand after committing a murder. 

'I died with a feeling of great guilt, 
because of what I have done', he told Naughtie. 'And I died asking my mon Dieu for 
forgiveness because I had committed the ultimate crime of all.'

SCROLL DOWN TO HEAR THE INTERVIEW

'Bizarre interview': David Suchet and Radio 4's Jim Naughtie after an interview where the ghost of Hercule Poirot spoke about his life and death

Poirot admitted he never fell in love and said he hoped his fans believed he had 'rid it (the world) of a certain amount of disharmony and evil and made it perhaps, humbly, a much better place'.

Unsurprisingly, people flocked to Twitter
to express their confusion with some admitting they were unsure if they
were 'still dreaming'.

David Suchet made his final appearance as Poirot last night after starring in the ITV series for 25 years.

In a virtuoso swansong, he shocked viewers by murdering a psychopath who was planning to kill again before committing suicide. 

Suchet has now performed every one of the stories Agatha Christie wrote about the quirky supersleuth.

But it was a very different Hercule Poirot that viewers bid 'adieu' to on Wednesday evening.

In shock: In Agatha Christie's 'Curtain', Poirot was seen shooting a man in the head in ITV's last ever episode of the detective drama

The end: Poirot lies dead in his bed, and he told Radio 4 today that he hoped that fans believed he made the world a better place

October 31: Not content with a simple ‘goodbye’, BBC presenter Kirsty Wark instead ended an edition of Newsnight with a dance – because it was Halloween.

Miss Wark, 58, surprised viewers by joining ten dancers to perform part of the routine to Michael Jackson’s hit Thriller.

November 12: Question Time presenter David Dimbleby throws convention to the wind at the ripe old age of 75 by having a scorpion inked onto his shoulder.

The veteran presenter said he decided to ‘man up’ and visit an east London tattoo parlour while filming his latest TV series Britain And The Sea for BBC1.

November 13: Jeremy Paxman found a new way of signing off... with a tattoo tribute to Mr Dimbleby.

Paxman displayed his knuckles to reveal the words ‘Good Nite’ in gothic black letters.

Old
and ill, he was not the dapper and confident little fellow who strutted 
about with his cane  wearing his gleaming patent leather shoes.

Instead, viewers saw him hunched in a wheelchair, being carried up and downstairs.

It was eventually revealed he had killed a murderer and then himself.

In the 'strange' Today interview, asked to reflect on his life Poirot said: 'I think for me it's been the most extraordinary time when I think of my life, to which you refer.

'I think it has been a wonderful life given to me by the mon Dieu (God) and I have hopefully been successful always'.

When asked 'Did you die with a feeling of humility?'', he replied: ' I died with a feeling of 
great guilt, because of what I have done.And I died asking my mon Dieu 
for forgiveness because I had committed the ultimate crime of all. Murder.'

When asked: 'Now you are gone, what do you want them to think of you?'.

He said: 'I would hope that when people, when thinking about me, Hercule Poirot, they will think that by having me in this
world together with them, I have rid it of a certain amount of 
disharmony and evil and made it perhaps, humbly yet forcefully a much 
better place.

Finally he was asked: 'Did you die a contented man?', he replied: 'I don't think in death anyone can be content, not even Hercule Poirot'.

Presenter Jim Naughtie's questioning was considered so strange 
co-presenter Sarah Montagu stifled giggles as she said afterwards: 'Jim speaking to
Hercule Poirot there, a truly bizarre interview.'

While another Today presenter, Justin Webb, joked that his colleague Mr Naughtie should try an interview with the ghost of Jimi Hendrix next.

Twitter user Tom freeman said: 'I just caught the end of Jim Naughtie interviewing David Suchet as Poirot's ghost. Not sure if I've actually woken up yet'.

Support: Fellow Today presenter Justin Webb joked that Jim Naughtie should try an interview with the ghost of Jimi Hendrix next

Annie Scott asked: 'Is @BBCr4today really airing an interview with Poirot's ghost.... or have I just not had enough sleep?'

Elizabeth Cairns ‏said: Incredibly, Naughtie is actually interviewing Poirot's GHOST. It is a post-mortem interview of a fictional character'.

Hercule Poirot (HP): I think for me it's been the most extraordinary time when I think of my life, to which you refer.

I think it has been a wonderful life given to me by the mon Dieu and I have hopefully been successful always.

Jim Naughtie (JN): Did you die with a feeling of humility?

HP: 'I died with a feeling of great guilt, because of what I have done.And I died asking my mon Dieu for forgiveness because I had committed the ultimate crime of all.

JN: Which is?

HP: Murder.

JN: And you took the secret to your grave?

HP: Naturellement but if you are a man with faith nothing you do is secret.

JN: When people think of you now you are gone, what do you want them to think of you?

HP: It is an interesting question that you pose.Let me consider it well.

I would hope that when people, when thinking about me, Hercule Poirot, they will think that by having me in thios world together with them, I have rid it of a certain amount of disharmony and evil and made it perhaps, humbly yet forcefully a much better place.

JN: What could you have done that you haven't done. You never found love did you?

HP: No, it was not given to me so. But to do I wish, of course I wish in my heart it had not been so but it would not have been possible for either a partner of mine to survive me or indeed for me to survive them.

But it's, I have to admit, a great loss.

JN: So despite you knowledge of sin, did you die a contented man?

HP: I don't think in death anyone can be content, not even Hercule Poirot.
