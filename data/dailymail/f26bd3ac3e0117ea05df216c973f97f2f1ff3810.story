Manchester United defender Phil Jones was left red-faced on his side's tour of the USA after fitness coach Tony Strudwick was forced to cover his expenses during an afternoon of shopping.

Jones forgot to take any cash with him as the pair explored Washington, leaving Strudwick to pick up the cost of two taxi fares and a drink for the 22-year-old.

Taking to Twitter to joke about the 22-year-old, Strudwick wrote: 'Had a good afternoon shopping with @PhilJones4. Paid his cab fares either way and bought him a Starbucks coffee. Shock he had no cash!'

Forgetful: Manchester United defender Phil Jones was forced to borrow money from fitness coach Tony Strudwick after failing to take any cash out with him during an afternoon off in America

Familiar problem: Jones, pictured here tussling with Liverpool's Raheem Sterling, is reportedly well known for forgetting his wallet

The United coach added: 'Should have paid me for his poor banter all afternoon.'

It appears it isn't the first time the England defender has forgotten his wallet after United team-mate Ashley Young replied to Strudwick's tweet with: 'no shock there with @PhilJones4 haha'

The fitness specialist responded to Young, adding that Jones had: 'Gave it the "My card doesn't work abroad shout"!'

Jones, who is reported to earn around Â£50,000-a-week, didn't deny Strudwick's accusations and later tweeted: 'cheers Strudz'

A source told The Sun: 'Phil has been getting some stick from the lads.

'He's pretty forgetful and always seems to have left his wallet at home when he's out. He's like the Queen because he never seems to carry any cash.'

United completed their tour of the USA with a 3-1 victory against rivals Liverpool in the final of the International Champions Cup.
