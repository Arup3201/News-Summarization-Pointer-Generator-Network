Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker is being flamed online due to his recent attempt to cultivate facial hair. 

The former footballer, 54, has been compared to Guy Fawkes, Jimmy Hill and Colonel Saunders after growing a greying moustache and goatee-beard. 

Others said the former Everton striker looked as if he should be appearing in The Three Musketeers.

Internet wags have compared the former Everton striker with KFC founder Colonel Saunders 

Others have said that the goatee beard makes him look like someone from the Gunpowder Plot

RossEFC95 claimed: 'Gary Lineker is turning into Jimmy Hill. Suddenly has a pointy chin with a terrible goatee beard.'

Jimmy Hill appeared on Match of the Day over four decades appearing on the show more than 600 times. 

He was renowned for his pronounced chin and highly sculpted beard. 

One Twitter user, Mr Meeow claimed: 'Gary Lineker needs to lose the three musketeers beard. Grow old gracefully.'

The Godfather of Betting said: 'Is Gary Lineker's attempt at a moustache and beard for a bet? It's horrendous.' 

Reaction on Twitter to Gary Lineker's new facial hair was quite vitriolic as witnessed by this tweet 

Many Twitter users decided that Gary Lineker looked remarkably similar to the Gunpowder Plotters 

Others decided that he resembled a member of the Three Musketeers

Although Tiaaaaaa praised the new style: 'I fancy Gary Lineker, his beard is divine.' 

Others questioned whether it was November, with an obscure reference to Guy Fawkes. Another asked whether he was following the style of celebrity baker Paul Hollywood. 

Michelle Jones added: 'Gary "Guy Fawkes" Lineker looking ever more like a supporter of "The Gunpowder Plot". Great beard Gary!'. 

Such is the impact of the former Barcelona man's beard that it has even got it's own Twitter account, following the example of Donald Trump's hair, which is regularly lampooned on the internet. 

Match of the Day viewers have been particularly unkind over Gary Lineker's new facial hair (before and after)
