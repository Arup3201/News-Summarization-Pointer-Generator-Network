A Maine man has been charged with killing his girlfriend and her two children, whose bodies were discovered inside the mobile home they shared.

Keith Coleman, of Garland, faces three counts of murder in the deaths of 36-year-old Christina Sargent, her 10-year-old son, Duwayne Coke, and her 8-year-old daughter, Destiny Sargent. 

The three were found dead inside the family's trailer just before 10pm Saturday by Penobscot County sheriff's deputies, who had been alerted by worried relatives.

So young: Duwayne Coke (right), 10, and his 8-year-old sister, Destiny Sargent (left), were discovered slain inside their family's trailer home in Maine 

Acting on a tip, deputies searching for Coleman found him Sunday afternoon at an apartment building in Bucksport where he was visiting friends. 

The minivan that Coleman had been driving and that police had sought was found parked outside the apartment.

Coleman, 27, was transported to the state police barracks in Bangor for questioning, then sent to the Penobscot County Jail. His first court appearance will be Monday or Tuesday, state police said.

Autopsies on the mother and her children are scheduled for Monday. Authorities have not said how they think the family were killed.

The mobile home is under police guard. Detectives planned to return Monday.

The Bangor Daily News reported two of the bodies were discovered inside the home at 12 Paul Road in rural Maine by a relative performing a welfare check on the family.

Crime scene: Sheriff's deputies were called to Sargent's mobile home in a Bangor suburb by concerned relatives 

Shocking find: A family member arrived at the trailer on rural Paul Road first and came upon two of the victims' bodies 

When sheriff's deputies arrived on the scene at 9.50pm, they came upon the third body.

The sheriff's office launched a search Saturday night for Keith Coleman in connection to the deaths after naming him a person of interest.

The 27-year-old was taken into custody at around 3pm Sunday as he was leaving a friend's apartment in Bucksport.

Coleman's ex-girlfriend Amanda Ellis told the paper that the man and Christina Sargent, who was her cousin, had been together since January 2012.

History of violence: Coleman's ex-girlfriend - and Sargent's cousin - said the man had tried to stranle her several times and threatened her with a knife before they broke up   

Ellis, who has a 3-year-old with Coleman, said the suspect has a history of domestic violence, including several instances in which the 27-year-old had tried to strangle her and pulled a knife on her.

Coleman's criminal record includes two arrests in 2011 and 2013 on outstanding warrants, and a conviction in October 2011 for growing marijuana
