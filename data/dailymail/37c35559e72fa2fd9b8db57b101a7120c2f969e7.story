Thrill of the hunt: You'll have to do whatever it takes to survive, including hunting the island's animals

Marooned on an island off the coast of Japan, Lara Croft began armed with nothing more than her wits and will to live.

Forced to forage for food and defend herself from hostile natives, you'll play through her transformation from timid youngster to hardened warrior.

Fighting to save her friends, Lara is pushed to the limit - knowing that if she doesn't survive, none of them will.
