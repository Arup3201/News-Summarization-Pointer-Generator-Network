A great-grandfather has pleaded guilty to looting clothes in this summer's riots.

Thomas Hart, 69, has become the oldest person to be convicted of involvement in the unrest which swept England in August.

He claims he committed the crime when drunk, having consumed at least six pints of lager before joining a crowd of yobs looting JD Sports.

Convicted: Thomas Hart, 69, pleaded guilty to burglary yesterday

Hart handed himself in to police after seeing his picture printed in a newspaper, and yesterday pleaded guilty to burglary at Camberwell Green magistrates' court.

He is now out on bail, and will be sentenced at Inner London crown court next month.

As he was leaving the pub following his massive drinking session on August 8, Hart was caught up in gangs of rioters looting shops in Lewisham, south-east London.

He joined them in breaking in to the sports shop and took a number of tops, which have not been recovered by police.

Youth: Most rioters were much younger than great-grandfather Hart

Speaking outside court yesterday, he told the Daily Mirror: 'I was stupid. I'd had a good drink.

'I wasn't one of those people setting fire to things and smashing the place up - there's no need for that.

'I took two or three jumpers but I didn't get them home. Someone pushed me to the ground.'

The rioting cost JD Sports more than Â£700,000, as the shop is popular with the teenagers and young people who made up the majority of looters.
