Christine Channon arriving at court where she admitted to drinking nearly twice the legal drink drive limit

A Tory council chief has been banned from the roads after telling police who arrested her that she would be over the limit because she'd had two cans of Special Brew.

Councillor Christine Channon, cabinet member for education at Devon County Council, stopped in her home town Budleigh Salterton after crashing her car.

Witnesses said they saw her trying to park and called the police and described her speech as being slurred and she was 'unsteady on her feet and finding it difficult to balance.

Prosecutor David Barnes said she told police: 'I will be over the limit. I have drunk two cans of Special Brew.'

At
the police station on February 25 she gave a breathalyser sample of 61 
which was nearly twice the legal drink drive limit of 35.

When
she was interviewed she then claimed to have had a 'small glass of wine
and a Special Brew' but made no comment about the collision and 
clipping another car's wing mirror.

The drink is more commonly associated with homeless alcoholics then Tory councillors.

Representing
herself in court Channon said: 'First of all some of the evidence is 
not correct. I am certain I only had one can because I only had one can 
in my house.'

She said she had gone to the shops to buy eggs and butter for a church celebration meal she had agreed to make.

Channon said she also suffers from a frozen shoulder which affected her ability to park her car.

She denied telling one of the witnesses she was a councillor but said the person recognised her over a contentious local council dispute to do with allotments.

She said: 'I resigned my post as Cabinet member for schools and learning at Devon County Council over what has happened and apologise for letting them down in my momentary lapse of judgement. I am extremely sorry, I had no intention of drink driving.'

She was banned from driving for 18 months and find £450 after admitting drink driving.

Channon is also chair of the county’s Children’s Trust Board, the Devon Local Admissions Forum and is chair of the Teachers Joint Consultative committee as well as being on the Standing Advisory Council for Religious Education.
