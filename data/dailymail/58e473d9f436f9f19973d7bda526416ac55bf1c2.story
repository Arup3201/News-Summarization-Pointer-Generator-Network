Despite their lack of cachet in the high-fashion realm, sales of bandage dresses are soaring on eBay – with the auction site reporting that purchases have doubled since last year.

In the run up to the World Cup, eBay investigated how Brazilian trends have taken hold in the U.S. over the past few months.

In looking at sales between March and May 2014 the site found that 500,000 bodycon dresses have been purchased by eager bidders worldwide.

Unfashionable turns: Despite their lacking fashion quotient, bodycon dresses have doubled their sales on eBay in the U.S. over the last few months (pictured, Carmen Electra wears a bandage dress in Los Angeles in April, left; Minnie Driver appears in a Herve Leger dress, right)

When broken down geographically, this 
equates to 200per cent more bodycon dresses being sold on the site to 
U.S.-based customers than during the same time period in 2013. Sales of 
the style have increased by 93per cent globally.

Another
 popular trend in Brazil, ombre, which is fabric that gradates between 
two colors or from light to dark, has risen by 45per cent in the U.S. 
and 56per cent globally.

Approximately 60,000 ombre pieces have been sold on the site in these few months.

Providing
 even more evidence of a surging interest in Brazilian fashion is how 
sales of the Rio de Janeiro-based brand Osklen have increased on eBay by
 62per cent in the U.S. and 69per cent worldwide.

The
 auction site also cites a rise in bikini sales as a sign that Brazilian
 fashion trends are taking a greater hold in the global landscape.

More
 than one million bikinis have sold on the site between March and May – a
 large amount that could also be attributed to the approaching warmer 
months.

However, eBay says that this number represents a year-on-year increase of 27per cent in the U.S. and 31per cent worldwide.
