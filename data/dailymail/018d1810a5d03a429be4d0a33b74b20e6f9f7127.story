While most people associate Oktoberfest with beers and bratwursts, a German second division side have gone a step further to toast the annual event.

Struggling 1860 Munich have unveiled a limited edition away kit styled on the lederhosen - a traditional national costume.

And finally... Belgium, Peru, Crystal Palace and more: A tribute to the ten greatest football kits with a sash 

Luckily for their players, the shorts, which are usually made out of leather, have been manufactured in a different fabric to ensure their movement is not affected. 

The unique away kit will be launched this Saturday (September 20) when Munich entertain FC Ingolstadt 04 to coincide with the opening weekend of Oktoberfest.

However, fans will have to wait until three days later when they travel to SV Sandhausen to see their heroes in their new strip.

Supporters will be hoping the change in costume can kick-start a season that has seen them win just once in their opening five games.
