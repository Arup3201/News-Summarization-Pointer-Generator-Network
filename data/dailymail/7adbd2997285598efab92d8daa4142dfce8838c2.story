The third match of Rangers’ pre-season tour of North America had a theatrical start on Tuesday morning as the Victoria Skydivers parachuted in to drop the match ball onto the centre circle.

From then on in, however, a second string Rangers side failed to scale any great heights themselves as they narrowly edged past Canadian part-timers Victoria Highlanders.

Ally McCoist had made 10 changes from the side that beat Sacramento Republic 2-1 on Saturday night in northern California, with only Marius Zaliukas keeping his place in the starting line-up.

Ian Black was the only other name from the strong team that lost 3-1 to Ventura County Fusion last week.

But in Centennial Stadium, the venue that hosted the 1994 Commonwealth Games, the Ibrox fringe players largely failed to prove to their manager they can be worth their weight in gold in the upcoming Championship season.

Youngster Calum Gallagher was arguably the pick of the bunch, scoring one, nearly adding another, and setting up a strike for frontman Nicky Clark.

But after a decent first-half performance, levels dipped against a semi professional outfit that play in the fourth-tier of the US soccer pyramid, although Rangers did hold out to record their second win of their visit to California and Canada.

It’s certainly fair to say there has been more than a touch of the bizarre about this tour. None more so than when Rangers waltzed past Sacramento Republic in a stunning stadium in front of the California State Fair on Saturday night.

In Sacramento, free chicken sandwiches were dished out to fans to ‘celebrate’ the first booking for a Rangers player, while supporters won free pizza when Sacramento scored.

On Tuesday morning, the surreal quotient was fulfilled in the form of the skydivers landing one-by-one on the pitch, to the booming soundtrack of ‘It’s Raining Men’ by The Weathergirls.

It literally was raining men and when the last skydiver delivered the match ball onto the centre circle, the majority of the 5000-capacity crowd hooted and hollered their raucous approval. There were a few raised eyebrows among the travelling Scots, however.

Rangers were then serenaded onto the park by the Victoria Pipe Band, with the whole hoopla causing the match to be more than 20 minutes late kicking off.

But the Ibrox side did not waste any time taking the lead when Black – who scored the late winner against Sacramento - rolled the ball across the goalline and young Gallagher was there at the back post to stab home.

For Victoria Highlanders, there was a familiar name up front in Blair Sturrock, the son of former Dundee United winger and ex manager Paul Sturrock. But it was his strike partner Cam Hundal who equalised just 120 seconds after Rangers had gone ahead, capitalising on slack defending to roll the ball past keeper Steve Simonsen from 16 yards.

Rangers edged back in front when the lively Gallagher’s shot was beaten away by Victoria keeper Elliot Mitrou, only for the alert Clark to turn home the rebound from a position prone on the ground.

It then took a terrific point-blank save by Mitrou to prevent Gallagher adding a third before half time.

But there was a blow when Rangers lost Faure after he appeared to twist his knee. Fellow right back Richard Foster has already damaged his hamstring on this tour, meaning Barrie McKay was introduced with Robbie Crawford dropping to right back.

Zaliukas would later add to McCoist’s woes by hobbling off injured in the second minute of 'Wilson Transportation Added Time', as it was called by the Stadium announcer.

The second half saw McCoist seek goals by throwing on David Templeton and Kris Boyd for Clark and Shiels, then teenager Andrew Murdoch for Gallagher.

Templeton very nearly grabbed a third, but was thwarted by the latest heroics by Mitrou. But Victoria had a few decent shots at Simonsen’s goal themselves as Rangers limped dismally over the line.

For McCoist, a consolation will be that most of the players on show won’t be starting the first league match at home to Hearts later this month.

But the Rangers manager will surely be demanding improvement when his side wraps up their North American tour when they face Ottawa Fury on Wednesday night out here in Canada.
