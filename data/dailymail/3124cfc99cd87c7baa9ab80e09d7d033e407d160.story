Shaun Reid barked one last piece of advice for his Warrington Town players as they pulled into the Gateshead International Stadium for their FA Cup second round tie on Sunday.

'This is no day out,' he growled. 'And anyone who thinks that can stay on the f***ing coach.'

The Conference ground may be better-known for athletics than football – local boy Brendan Foster famously broke a world record there – but it could have been Wembley Stadium for the gardeners, plasterers and pizza delivery drivers who made up the Warrington team.

Even to reach this stage of the competition was a miracle for a club who sit 16th in the northern section of the Evo-Stik League – the eighth tier of English football – and 79 places below Gateshead in the pyramid.

Manager Reid, younger brother of Everton and England star Peter, doesn't mind being considered old school. Over team breakfast at the Mercure Hotel in Washington on Sunday morning, he mused that the trappings might make his team soft.

'You need hunger to win. It's all about this,' beating his chest as he sat down for his scrambled eggs and toast.

Reid and Warrington, who became national heroes by beating League Two Exeter City in the first round, kindly granted Sportsmail access all areas for their big day.

More than a thousand Wire fans, four times their average home gate, had travelled the 160 miles north, which was as cold and windy as you'd expect approaching Christmas.

If those supporters had heard Reid and his coach Stuart Mellish in the dressing-room beforehand, they would have put on boots themselves and prepared to run through brick walls.

It was intense stuff. 'Help your mates out there. There will be mistakes and when they happen, help each other. I believe in you,' implored Reid.

'Go and make history,' shouted Mellish, who had the unenviable task of reading out the chosen team line-up in the dressing-room an hour before kick off.

The pair went through some cup battles as team-mates at Rochdale including one infamous League Cup tie against Wimbledon when Reid responded to being bitten on the arm by Vinnie Jones, by biting him on the neck.

It was a family affair too. Chairman Toby Macormac's wife and two young children travelled with him to the stadium on the players' team coach although Reid ushered them off on arrival before he embarked on a motivational speech he knew would contain swear words.

Craig Robinson, brother of MK Dons manager Karl, was blessed at the team hotel by his nine-year-old daughter and 20 members of the Reid family travelled together to the game from Merseyside.

Unfortunately in football, there is always an opponent to upset best-laid plans.

Gateshead started like a side operating three divisions higher than Warrington.

With 35-year-old former Everton and Wales international John Oster pulling the strings, they took the lead after eight minutes through former Newcastle United striker Matty Pattison.

And it was only grim determination from Warrington, allied to saves by goalkeeper Karl Wills and two Gateshead attempts that hit the woodwork that kept the game close.

As Reid rallied the troops at half-time, Macormac and the other directors took stock over a cup of coffee. 'You can see the benefits of being full-time,' said board member Gary Skentlebury. Warrington's players earn around £70-a-week from football.

But the Cheshire minnows, the lowest-ranked side left in the competition, did themselves proud after half-time in front of the BT Sport cameras.

Scot Metcalfe went close to an equaliser and substitute Ashley Ruane was denied a strong penalty appeal. Metcalfe is arguably Town's best player but has an attitude that needs work.

'I tried to sign him for 14 months but he didn't want to leave New Mills because they were near his house,' said Reid, before smiling 'but I got him in the end.' 

A late second goal from Wright after a mis-kick by Wills sealed Gateshead's win as the form book demanded.

Reid tried to gee his players up afterwards. 'We have to go again and win the league,' he said. 'You are good players.'

Then his real feelings were revealed as he turned the corner and aggressively swiped a jug of water off a nearby table and covered the floor.

On Monday it will be Gateshead, managed by former Nottingham Forest European Cup winner, who will be alongside Manchester United and Liverpool in the FA Cup third round draw.

But Warrington won't be forgotten in a hurry after their amazing nine-match run in the competition.

They have earned nearly £200,000 from this season's FA Cup – equivalent to five years' revenue in normal times - and have ended the notion that Warrington is exclusively a rugby town.

But now, in time-honoured tradition, they have to concentrate on the league. Next up on Tuesday night are Radcliffe Borough.
