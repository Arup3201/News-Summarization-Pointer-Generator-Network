A fast-moving green-tailed fireball appeared in the sky last night over much of the eastern U.S. in the midst of an annual meteor shower. 

The American Meteor Society says they received more than 200 reports of the fireball last night around 6:20pm, from as far north as the Great Lakes to the southern state of Georgia. 

Those who witnessed the marvel said the fireball was greenish-to-white in color as it crossed the sky, and there was no sign that it hit anywhere.

All over the map: The above map shows where there were reports of a fireball in the sky Monday night, over 12 eastern states 

The reports came from the states of Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. 

These sightings come during the annual Taurid meteor shower, which is going on right now and could lead to more reports of meteors in the next few nights. 

Taurid meteors are fragments of the Comet Encke, Bill Cooke of the Meteoroid Environment Office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center told WQAD. 

Encke is a three-mile wide comet of ice and rock that circles the sun every 3.3 years and its fragments are very large - producing bright meteors when their hit the Earth's atmosphere.

One man in Chicago recorded a fireball traveling through the sky in that city, but it was later determined that the sightings were actually just a promotional stunt carried out by Red Bull. 

To promote an upcoming Red Bull event, three skydivers jumped out of a plane with flares shooting from their shoes as they drifted to the ground - creating a similar sight. 

Monday night's sightings also corresponded with a similar event over western Japan when night fell there hours before. 

Experts believe the object seen in Japan was a bolide, which is a very bright shooting star.  

On the other side of the world: A similar green object was seen over western Japan Monday night as well
