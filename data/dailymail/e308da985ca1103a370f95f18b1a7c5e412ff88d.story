A 15-year-old boy has been arrested by police officers investigating a racist tweet aimed at Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck.

The teenager was held and questioned on suspicion of racial abuse following the posting of a sickening message on Twitter after Welbeck scored the winner to knock his former club Manchester United out of the FA Cup on March 9.

Officers from Greater Manchester Police launched a probe after a fellow user of the social media site registered a complaint.

The vile, racist rant, tweeted by user @angeIsleftfoot, read: 'Welbeck is dead to me, the f****** c***…’

The tweet, posted after Welbeck's decisive role in Arsenal's 2-1 Quarter Final victory at Old Trafford, continued with sickening references that are  too offensive to publish here.

Sportsmail understands officers in Manchester with specialist training in social media identified the user and passed on the information to Wiltshire Police, who confirmed they have now made an arrest.

A spokesman for Wiltshere Police said: 'A 15-year-old male from the Salisbury area was arrested on the evening of March 12 on suspicion of racial abuse.

'He has been released on police bail until April 13. 

Welbeck was jeered by a minority of United fans after being replaced by Olivier Giroud late in the game

'He has been bailed to return to Melksham Police station then.'

The vitriolic slur was one of a number of disturbing messages posted in the aftermath of Welbeck's triumphant return to United.

Some stated that they hoped the 24-year-old, who is from Manchester, would die while one user threatened to kill him.

Welbeck was shown the door by United boss Louis van Gaal last year, who claimed he was not good enough. 

Welbeck spent six seasons at United after coming through the club's youth system

He seized upon a poor backpass to give Arsenal a lead they would not relinquish and then celebrated in front of the 9,000 visiting supporters - an action which was welcomed by many pundits.

Despite isolated boos, Welbeck was applauded from the field by the majority of United fans when he was substituted in the 74th minute.

The Twitter account in question is no longer active.
