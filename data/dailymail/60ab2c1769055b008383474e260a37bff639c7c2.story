A Nevada mother who was trapped is a terrifying snowstorm for six days has described her horror at finding her boyfriend's dead body after he went looking for help.

Paula Lane, 46, was crawling towards a nearby highway when she found her partner, Roderick Clifton, dead and frozen in the road. The couple's jeep had got stuck in the snow on November 29 after they decided to go off-roading near the Sierra Nevada mountains.

Lane is still recovering from serious frostbite but she said the most excruciating pain is from losing Clifton, who she is hailing a hero for risking his life to save hers.

'He died trying to save my life,' the mother of twin boys told Fox 40 News, breaking into sobs.

She said she discovered Clifton's body days after the couple's jeep got stuck in the freezing wilderness and promised that she wouldn't let him be forgotten.

'I literally came across where he was laying in the middle of the road. He looked peaceful,' she explained, tears flowing.

'I wanted to kiss him but I didn't know if that would be right or not. So I just sat there for about a half hour and I talked to him and thanked him for trying to save my life and told him I would make sure he wasn't forgotten.'

The couple got lost when they took a detour through the Sierra Nevada mountains on their way home from Lane's mother's home in California. The next morning, Clifton went to get help, leaving Lane in his Jeep, which was stranded on a secluded forest road.

Lane survived six days in the freezing wilderness by sleeping in a hollowed out tree and eating green tomatoes. She was found by her brother, Gary, almost a week after she and Clifton set off on November 29.

Lane is now safe at home in Gardnerville, recovering from severe frostbite. She can barely walk because of her injuries and remains in excruciating pain but wanted people to know that her boyfriend was a hero.

'I want people to know what a good person he was and that he would have done anything for anybody and he did not purposefully put me in danger and he risked his life to keep me out of it,' she said.

Clifton's funeral is being held on Friday, but his family are still struggling to cover the cost of it.

While she was trapped in the 
terrifying snowstorm, Lane left a tearful video for her twin 11-year-old
sons, whom she feared she would never see again.

'I’m so sorry this has happened,' the
shaking, shivering mother said into the camera as she sat huddled in 
Clifton's stranded Jeep.

'I just want to come home. As soon as
the sun comes out, I’m going to have to try to make it. It’s seven 
miles in six feet of snow. Nobody’s ever going to find me here at 
Burnside Lake.'

Lane watched the video she recorded during the ordeal on the TODAY Show last week alongside her brother and his friend, Brian Roff.

'It’s really hard,' Lane said about viewing her sheer terror on the video.

'That’s only the fourth time that I’ve seen it. When
I first made the tape, I wanted it to be more of a happy goodbye. I 
knew it was going to be a goodbye, I felt. Once I started talking, I 
almost felt like somebody else was there with me, and I’m getting to 
release to somebody. It was the first time I cried since the ordeal had 
begun, and to watch it now, it’s surreal.'

Lane recalled the emotional moment 
when her boyfriend, Roderick Clifton left the car to get help, saying 
that she warned him not to head out into the storm but he dismissed her 
pleas.

'It's 9.09 in the morning, I remember
looking at my watch and I said please just wait, let's ride this out 
together. It's the smarter (thing), and he just went like this with his hand and 
that's the last time I saw him,' she said during an appearance on The Today Show, gesturing as Clifton did when
he headed out for help.

'I knew I was never going to see him again.'

Lane remained in the vehicle for two more days, surviving on a package of 
green tomatoes and snow. She was not dressed for cold weather and had to
use tissues and tape to make socks.

She also huddled in a hollow tree for warmth at night.

Lane was finally discovered by her brother when he heard her whistling loudly
as she was crawling towards the highway for help.

'I'd seen her in many different looks in her life and that look right there, that's the best one I'd ever seen,' her brother Gary Lane said of when he finally found his younger sister.

Gary and his friend borrowed a front loader that is typically used on construction sites, and they searched throughout the wooded Sierra Nevadas near a campground that Lane used to frequent.

The couple spent the first stranded night together in their car, but Clifton insisted on leaving for help the next morning.

Mystery: Authorities are still unsure of Clifton's cause of death

It is believed the couple took their Jeep off-roading when they became stranded in the Sierra Nevada mountains somewhere off Highway 88/89 on November 29.

Because of limited cell service in the high altitudes, authorities were unable to track their phones.

'We were told they were off four-wheel driving up that road and got 
stuck,' said Citrus Heights spokesman Officer Bryan G. Fritsch.

Clifton left the jeep on November 30 in an effort to seek help but he never returned. His body was discovered on Wednesday, several miles away from the highway. He is survived by three daughters.

Survivor: It was Paula Lane's brother Gary, left, who found her. She is still recovering from frostbite at home

When her boyfriend failed to return, Lane waited in the vehicle until Monday when she decided to set out to look for him.

She told rescuers she found his body as she tried to make her way to the highway.

A massive manhunt had been launched on December 1 to search for the pair and her brother, Gary Lane, had rented a front loader and was patrolling the roadway.

'It's been a rough haul, waiting all those days, trying to know if she'd made it or not,' Lane's older sister, Linda Hathaway, said at a news conference at Carson Tahoe Regional Hospital, where Lane was admitted for first-degree frostbite and malnourishment, according to ABC News. 

Hathaway said they had prepared her sons for the worst. 

'She is mighty and she's a survivor and loves life,' Hathaway said about her sister's strength amidst the terrifying ordeal.

Location: Clifton and Lane were traveling to their Gardnerville, Nevada, home from Clifton's mother's house in Citrus Heights, California

Searching: After spending a day in the Jeep, Clifton went off on his own to find help
