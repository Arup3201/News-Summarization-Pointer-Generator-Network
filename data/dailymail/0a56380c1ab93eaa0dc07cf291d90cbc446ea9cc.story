A senior reporter at the Sun and a former policeman are to face criminal charges over alleged corrupt payments for information.

Virginia Wheeler, who is the newspaper’s defence editor, and Paul Flattley, who was a Metropolitan Police constable, were told yesterday they are to be prosecuted for allegedly conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office.

It is alleged the officer was paid at 
least £4,000 in cheques and £2,450 in cash in exchange for information, 
including details linked to the death of a 15-year-old girl, the Crown 
Prosecution Service said.

Principal legal adviser to the Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Levitt QC said: 'We have concluded, following a careful review of the evidence, that former Metropolitan Police Service police constable Paul Flattley and Virginia Wheeler, a journalist at The Sun newspaper, should be charged with conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office.'

Rebekah Brooks, former News International chief executive, is one of six people to have been charged in Operation Elveden

The charges are being brought as a result of Operation Elveden, Scotland Yard’s inquiry into alleged corrupt payments to public officials.

So far, 56 people have been arrested as part of the inquiry, six have been charged, and two - a retired police officer and a former journalist - have been told they will face no further action.

Those charged include former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, 44, Sun chief reporter John Kay, 69, and Ministry of Defence employee Bettina Jordan-Barber, 39.

It is alleged that Brooks, from Oxfordshire, and Kay, from north-west London, conspired to pay Jordan-Barber, from Shrivenham, near Swindon, Wiltshire, around £100,000 for information.

David Cameron’s former spin doctor Andy Coulson and former News of the World royal correspondent Clive Goodman also face charges.

They are accused of conspiracy to pay for information including a royal phone directory known as the 'Green Book'.

It contained contact details for the Royal Family and members of their households.
