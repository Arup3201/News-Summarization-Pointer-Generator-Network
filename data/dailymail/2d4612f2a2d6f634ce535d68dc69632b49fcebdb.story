Railway passengers bedding down in this sleeper carriage will have made little progress with their journey by the time they wake.

Having once ferried travellers around Britain's rail network, the 1957 carriage has been lovingly converted into self-catering - and stationary - holiday accommodation for train spotters.

The business is the brainchild of Cornwall couple Lizzy and David Stroud, who bought their first carriage for £170 17 years ago after unearthing an old railway siding in their garden.

Nearly 20 years on, Railholiday now lets
four carriages and is in the process of restoring another five - having
bought from private collectors and even snapped up vintage carriages on
eBay.

The Strouds discovered the hidden siding after they bought a derelict rail station in the picturesque village of St Germans and set about turning it into a family home.

'It was the only property we could afford in the area at the time,' said Mrs Stroud, a musician, who added that she and her husband decided to put a rail carriage on the siding and turn it into a bedroom where visiting friends could spend the night.

The Strouds began renting out the accommodation in an effort to recoup some of the £12,000 they spent restoring it, and the carriage proved so popular it spawned a thriving family business.

Today
along with the original room - which the family christened the Old 
Luggage Van, guests can stay in a former travelling post office which 
once broke the 100mph speed barrier, or even - when restoration work on 
the Strouds' latest purchase is complete - a slip coach saloon created 
for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.

Mrs
Stroud said the carriages were originally aimed at railway enthusiasts 
who liked to stay in the offbeat accommodation while train-spotting in 
Cornwall.

But it has 
gone on to attract families, couples enjoying romantic breaks, and 
holidaymakers eager to experience something a little different.

'We
did some fairly heavy conversion work on our house, which was an old 
train station and was completely derelict,' said Mrs Stroud.

'Then we started scraping away the garden and found what turned out to be a railway siding. We thought how nice it would be to have a railway carriage on it,' she added.

Quaint: The couple started renting out one of the carriages to make the conversion cost-effective - and have since expanded the project into a business

Conversion: Lizzy and David Stroud spent around £45,000 converting each of the five vintage carriages

They began letting the Old Luggage Van in 1996 when Mrs Stroud was pregnant with the couple's first child, Walter, now 14.

From there they built up a family business that looks set to keep right on growing.

'We now have four carriages in total 
to let, three in St Germans and one in Hale,' said Mrs Stroud, who also 
has an 11-year-old daughter, Poppy.

'And we have five more in the works - but we're taking our time and doing things very slowly.'

The
Strouds are planning to turn one of their new carriages into entirely 
wheelchair-friendly accommodation, and another into a games room.

Cosy: The Strouds say the accommodation proves popular right through the winter months - so much so that they added a wood-burning stove in one of the carriages
