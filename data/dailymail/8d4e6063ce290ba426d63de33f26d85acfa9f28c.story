Mo'ne Davis reached out on Monday to a college president to ask him to reinstate a sophomore baseball player who called her a sexual slur.

The 13-year-old and her coach emailed Bloomsburg University President David L. Soltz to ask that first baseman Joey Casselberry be allowed to play for the Huskies again.

Casselberry had posted on Twitter: 'Disney is making a movie about Mo'ne Davis? WHAT A JOKE. That s*** got rocked by Nevada.' 

Director of the college's sports information, Tom McGuire, told Daily Mail Online in a statement: 'Mo’ne Davis has reached out to Bloomsburg University asking that Joey Casselberry’s dismissal from the team be reconsidered.

'Her request demonstrates the type of person she is, her level of maturity and the empathy that her family and coach teach her.'

Mr McGuire added: 'Bloomsburg University stands firm on our decision; however, his consequences will be reviewed as is common in disciplinary actions like this.'

Casselberry deleted the Twitter account, @BigCass24, but his name was taken off the team's roster this weekend, SI.com reported, after last playing for the team on March 17. 

Casselberry had reportedly apologized following the waves of criticism he attracted, according to TMZ. 

In tweets on Saturday night, BU Huskies posted: 'Bloomsburg Univ is deeply saddened by what was written about #MoneDavis by one of our student-athletes. His words do not represent us.'

The team added: 'We take matter very seriously; addressed the issue with the student-athlete (who has been dismissed from team), coach, and the team.'    

Social media lit up with support for Davis following the offensive remark. @mcarter619 posted: 'Joey Casselberry attacking a child says a lot about his character and a apology won't make this any better.' 

Dr Marshall Shepherd tweeted: 'Remember Mo'ne. Haters gonna hate keep head up.. .offensive tweet about Mo'ne Davis gets player kicked off team.'

The Disney Channel announced last week that it would be making a movie about 13-year-old Mo'ne, titled Throw Like Mo.

Disney said development was underway on the biographical film. It will tell the story of the 13-year-old who last summer made history as the first girl to pitch a shutout in the Little League World Series. 

A member of Philadelphia's Taney Dragons, Davis then became the first Little Leaguer to make the cover of Sports Illustrated magazine.

Davis' team was finally beaten by the Jackie Robinson West team  in the semi finals of the U.S. championship.

If Davis' team won, they would have gone on to challenge a team from Nevada. 

The 13-year-old has been a natural in the spotlight following her Little League success.  

 She told admirers that if they thought she was good at baseball, they should see her play hoops. 

Only in eighth grade, Davis already plays for her school's high school varsity basketball team and is also a regular on the soccer pitch.  

Davis aspires to play for the University of Connecticut and reach the WNBA. She plays midfielder on her soccer team and hopes to play three sports in high school, though she's not sure about baseball.

'I know the boys will be much stronger so that depends,' she said. 'Hopefully, I can continue playing as long as I can.'
