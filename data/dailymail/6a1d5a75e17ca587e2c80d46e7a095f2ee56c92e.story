Thieves have broken into the home of a DeSean Jackson's home and stolen more than $250,000 in cash and jewellery.

The burglary occurred at Jackson's home in South Philadelphia, not far from the team's practice facility, sometime earlier this week but was only discovered late on Friday night.

Police say the cash and jewelry was taken from a safe. A silver 9mm handgun is also missing.

According to Fox 29, Jackson's mother entered the home Friday night and finding it ransacked, called police Saturday morning.

She found one safe missing and two cracked open.

The football star is currently in Florida and was not in Philadelphia at the time of the robbery.

He has been posting pictures of himself enjoying end-of-season celebrations in Miami to his Instagram account, which could have been monitored by the thieves.
