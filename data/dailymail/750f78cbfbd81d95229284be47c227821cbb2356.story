Radamel Falcao has quashed any lingering injury fears by taking part in full Manchester United training on Sunday - and could be back for their game against Hull City.

The Colombian striker has been missing since the start of October with an ongoing calf problem.

Falcao, who sealed a season-long loan from Monaco on deadline day, has yet to complete a full 90 minutes in a red shirt.

Louis van Gaal has seen his side struggle in front of goal - despite scoring twice at Arsenal on Saturday 

But he is back training with Louis van Gaal's squad and has declared himself 'ready' to hit the ground running. 

The news comes as a welcome boost to the manager, who has seen his side struggle in front of goal in recent weeks, despite the win at Arsenal on Saturday. 

Robin van Persie's form has become a consistent worry for United and they have lacked a cutting edge in the final third all season. 

Falcao has scored just once for his new club - against Everton - and tweeted to his 7.3million followers: 'Back to training 100% and ready to help the team in the next games.'

There remain question marks as to whether Van Gaal will opt to sign Falcao permanently in the summer because of fitness issues, and he needs a run of games to prove his worth. 

'Do you think we expected he'd be injured for so many weeks? Because of that (injury setback) maybe we didn't buy him,' the United manager said last week.
