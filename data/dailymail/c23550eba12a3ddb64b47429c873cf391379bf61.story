New York Police Department officers are letting minor crimes slide in the wake of the murder of two cops shot while on duty in Brooklyn just over a week ago, claim sources within the department.

An unnamed NYPD supervisor told the New York Post that his officers are writing significantly fewer summonses and 'probably only making arrests when they have to - like when a store catches a shoplifter.'

'I'm not writing any summonses. Do you think I'm going to stand there so someone can shoot me or hit me in the head with an ax?' one cop told the Post.

'I'm concerned about my safety. I want to go to home to my wife and kids.'

A union mandate requiring that two patrol cars respond to all police calls – introduced following the shootings of Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu – has also contributed to slower response times to non-emergencies.

The Patrolmen's Benevolent Association's directive is creating a manpower shortage that is delaying response times to crimes such as burglaries and car crashes to as much as four hours, according to the paper.

Tensions between police, the city's elected leadership and residents have been heightened since the December 20 slayings of two police officers by Ismaaiyl Brinsley. 

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was booed on Monday by the newest members of the NYPD as he delivered a speech at the academy graduation ceremony. 

Several boos could be heard at Madison Square Garden as de Blasio took the podium in front of 884 newly-minted cops.

Mayor de Blasio ignored the boos and thanked the new recruits for their service to the city of New York

At least one cadet could be heard shouting 'traitor!' the New York Post reports. 

Then, when de Blasio remarked that the new officers would be confronted with problems they didn't make, someone from the crowd shouted, 'You created them!' The heckler was met with applause and cheering. 

The incident shows that mistrust has taken hold even among the NYPD's newest officers.

On Saturday, hundreds of cops turned their backs on de Blasio as he spoke at the funeral for Officer Rafael Ramos, one of two NYPD cops gunned down by a fanatic who was enraged about recent police brutality cases - including the death of Staten Island resident Eric Garner. 

The Mayor has come in for sharp criticism from the police union after expressing sympathy for protesters who took to the streets in the wake of a grand jury's failure to indict the NYPD cop who allegedly put Garner in a chokehold.

In a speech following the grand jury decision, de Blasio, whose children are half-black, recounted how he told his teenage son Dante how to deal with the police and that he might be discriminated against by the NYPD.  

Patrolman's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said de Blasio had 'blood on his hands' in the death of Ramos and his partner Officer Wenjian Liu, who were assassinated on December 20 as they sat in their squad car in Brooklyn.

Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said on Sunday that the strife between de Blasio and the rank-and-file officers is likely to last 'for some time.'

City Hall and the Patrolman's Benevolent Association are in the midst of rancorous contract negotiations that are set to go to arbitration - further exacerbating the strife. 

The Mayor and Lynch - his most outspoken critic - came face-to-face on Monday when they posed together for a photo for an award that the PBA gives out for the top squad sergeant from the graduating class. 

Lynch's son Kevin is among the graduating class.
