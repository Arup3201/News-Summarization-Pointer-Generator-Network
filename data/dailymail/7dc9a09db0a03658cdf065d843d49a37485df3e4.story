The British winner of Tuesday’s £81million EuroMillions jackpot
has come forward to claim their prize.

Organisers will not say whether the ticket holder, who
wishes to remain anonymous, is an individual or a syndicate.

If the huge prize has been claimed by a single winner, they
will instantly become Britain’s 908th richest person.

The British winner will enjoy £81million, the sixth biggest jackpot in National Lottery History

The £81,381,673.30 payout, which saw 
the lucky ticket-holder shoot to sixth on the National Lottery Rich 
List, had gone unclaimed since Tuesday night.

A Camelot spokesman said: ‘The claim has 
been validated and the prize is in the process of being paid out.’

The winner is just £10million short 
of guitarist Brian May, who is worth £90million, but can boast of being 
four times richer than singer Adele, who has a fortune of £20million.

The £81,381,673.30 payout will make them wealthier than Sir
Sean Connery and Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page, each estimated by the
Sunday Times Rich List to be worth £80million.

And they will be far richer than footballer
Wayne Rooney, whose fortune is estimated at £51million.

The life-changing sum could see the 
winner purchase their own Greek island, such as Omfori Island, currently
being advertised for just over £40million.

They could then trade in their old car
for a Lamborghini Veneno, one of the world's most expensive cars, at a 
cost of £2.5million, and also buy a dinosaur bone-encrusted iPad 2 Gold
History edition for £5million - and still have plenty left to spend.

Compared: The winner is now four times richer than singer Adele, but still £10m short of music icon Brian May

Or the winner could splash all of the 
money in one single purchase to buy one of the UK's most expensive homes
in Regent's Park in central London, which sold in March for £80million.

The winning numbers were 34, 38, 13, 
08, 26 and the Lucky Star numbers were 03 and 11. Since the EuroMillions
launched in February 2004, there have been 593 draws, including Tuesday
night's.

In that time, 38 UK ticket-holders have matched five numbers and two Lucky Stars to win the jackpot, or a share of it.

The winning ticket-holder of last night's EuroMillions has shot to sixth place on the National Lottery Rich List. So far, nobody has come forward to claim the bumper prize, Camelot said.

Here are the official top 10 biggest winners since the lottery began:

1. Colin and Chris Weir: £161,653,000The husband and wife, from Largs in Ayrshire, said they were 'tickled pink' after becoming Europe's biggest lottery winners in July 2011. 

Married for 30 years and with two children, the life-changing £161 million prize catapulted them into the Sunday Times Rich List above Beatle Ringo Starr and Sir Tom Jones.

Psychiatric nurse Mrs Weir, 55, and Mr Weir, 64, who worked as a TV cameraman and studio manager for 23 years, have reportedly bought a fleet of cars for friends since their win as well as a mansion.

2. Adrian and Gillian Bayford: £148,656,000Children's nurse Gillian, 40, and record seller Adrian, 41, from Haverhill, Suffolk, said they planned to fork out on luxury holidays and cars when they won in August last year.

Adrian joked to his wife that he had not bought any tickets, before she told him to be quiet as she was trying to get their children to sleep as he celebrated the win.

3. Anonymous: £113,019,926One British ticket scooped the massive prize in October 2010 but decided not to go public.

4. Dave and Angela Dawes: £101,203,600Dave Dawes, 47, a shift supervisor for Premier Foods, and Angela Dawes, 43, a volunteer for the British Heart Foundation, hit the EuroMillions jackpot in October 2011.

It was only the third time the couple, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, had played the lottery.

5. Anonymous: £84,451,320The haul was won in May 2010 but the winner kept their identity secret.

6. Anonymous: £81,381,673

Last night's winner, who is yet to come forward: £81,381,673

7. Nigel Page: £56,008,113

Self-confessed white van man Nigel Page, 43, scooped a cool £56 million in February 2010.

The skydiving enthusiast, who lived in a three-bedroom semi near Cirencester, Wiltshire, married his girlfriend Justine, 42, and moved into a mansion in the Cotswolds.

It was reported that he paid ex-wife Wendy, 43, £2million after she made a legal claim for £8million. The pair had separated 10 years before his bumper win.

8. Anonymous: £46,432,285

One British ticket scooped the massive prize in February last year but decided not to go public.

9. Les and Sam Scadding: £45,570,835Unemployed mechanic Les Scadding, 58, and his wife Samantha Peachey-Scadding, 38, from Caerleon, South Wales, bought one of two winning tickets which shared a £90million jackpot in November 2009.

Grandfather Mr Scadding was £68 overdrawn on his bank account on the day he bought his lucky ticket and had also beaten testicular cancer.

The other £45million-winning EuroMillions ticket was bought by a syndicate of seven office workers based in Merseyside.

The winners - dubbed the Magnificent Seven - were employed by Hewlett Packard to carry out IT work at a BT office in Liverpool.

John Walsh, 57, James Bennett, 28, Sean Connor, 32, Alex Parry, 19, Emma Cartwright, 23, Ceri Scullion, 35, and Donna Rhodes, 39, each banked £6.5million.

10. Cassey Carrington: £45,160,170Ms Carrington, 22, from Stapleford in Nottingham, banked the staggering total after matching all five numbers and two Lucky Stars in a EuroMillions draw in February 2012.

The Iceland store supervisor said she planned to marry painter fiancee Matt Topham, 22, in September following the Lucky Dip win. They became the second couple from the county to bank the jackpot in less than a month.
