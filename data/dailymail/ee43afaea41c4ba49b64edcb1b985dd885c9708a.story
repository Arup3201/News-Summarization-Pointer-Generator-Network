Police in Sydney have confiscated a haul of methamphetamine worth £297million after they were tipped off by an anonymous source.

They are hailing the find, the largest shipment of crystal meth they have ever seized, as a crippling blow to a powerful drugs syndicate, reports CNN.

The shipment was intercepted as it came into port from Southern China after a call made five months ago from an anonymous tipster in New South Wales to the state's Asian Crime Squad, police said.

An Australian, a Singaporean and a Hong Kong man have been arrested and more arrests could follow.

'That one phone call was the one thread that allowed us to pull and unravel a syndicate that will be stopped forever,' New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione said at a news conference.

The drugs were found thanks to the involvement of numerous law enforcement agencies and months of monitoring shipments coming into Sydney.

They were found last week hidden in bags of chemicals for cleaning products in a container from the southern Chinese trading hub of Shenzhen, according to police.

In total, authorities seized more than half a tonne of methamphetamine, a drug that is growing in popularity throughout Australia.

They were replaced with a harmless substance and delivered to a warehouse in Sydney, said Australian Federal Police Commissioner Tony Negus, and police swooped when the three suspects arrived and removed what they thought were the drugs.

They have been charged with multiple offenses including attempting to possess a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug.

If convicted they could face life in prison and a fine of £840,000.

Officers also found a secret drug manufacturing laboratory during the operation. Officials described the bust as an important victory in the fight against the growing threat of crystal meth, which until recent years was only seen as a problem in North America.

'Make no mistake, this is a hideous, insidious drug,' Scipione said. 'It's the one drug that we know is so popular across Australia that we need to continue to do all we can to take it out of circulation.'
