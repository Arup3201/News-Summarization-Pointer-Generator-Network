A brother and sister who have been jailed for carrying out bank heists with their father claimed that he gave them no choice but to take part.

Hayden Catt, 21, was sentenced to a decade in prison last month while his 19-year-old sister Abigail Catt was give five years after they pleaded guilty to helping their father robbing banks in Houston, Texas last year.

Their father Ronald Scott Catt, 51, was sentenced to 25 years today after accepting a plea deal. In an interview with 20/20, to be aired on Friday, the siblings revealed that their father recruited them for his bank robberies.

Abigail Catt will spend five years in prison and her brother Hayden got a decade in prison for a Texas bank robbery which they said their father ordered them to

Prosecutors say the father is suspected of five bank holdups by himself before recruiting his children.

The brother and sister said they had always noticed piles of cash around but it wasn't until the family had moved from Portland, Oregon to Texas last year that the truth came out.

Hayden told ABC News: 'That's when he approached me and said, ''Would you be willing to do something to get some money, more illegal 
than selling drugs?'' And I said, ''Yes.'''

Hayden says he was sent to ask his 18-year-old sister to be the getaway driver.

Abigail added: 'My dad sent my 
brother to ask me. I mean, it was just…in some way, I 
was led on, like, this is how I protect them, you know. And these are 
the only people I have, so....'

The siblings, who lost their mother to breast cancer when they were children, also told the ABC show of the adrenaline-pumping moment that they robbed the bank.

Hayden
said that while they were grabbing the money from the vault he was 
shaking so badly he couldn't get the cash in the bag, while Abigail said 
her father kept having to remind her not to drive too fast as they fled the scene.

On
October 1, 2012, two men entered the credit union on Cinco Ranch Boulevard 
in Fort Bend dressed in orange traffic vests and dark sunglasses and 
held up bank tellers at gunpoint.

The younger man wore a fake mustache, while the older man sported a painter's mask. Abigail was waiting outside with the engine running to ensure a quick getaway. They made away with $50,000 in cash.

Scott Catt was sentenced to 25 years in jail today for robbing at least five banks in Oregon and Texas, the latter with the help of his two children

Authorities
investigating the robbery linked the vests to those sold at Home 
Depot and at a branch of the store 14 miles from the First Community 
Credit Union they found stolen license plates that were linked to a car 
used in a robbery in Harris County in August.

In that robbery, the two male suspects wore painter masks and overalls as disguises.

'While
viewing videotapes at the checkout counters, they identified Hayden and
Abby Catt purchasing the vests with their father's debit card,' the 
Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office said. 'Scott Catt was later identified purchasing a painter's mask.'

The most important factor on the vests was the X on the back, which narrowed the search field.

Sheriff's
deputies arrest Ronald and Hayden Scott Catt on November 9 at a Katy, Texas 
apartment and later that day they apprehended Abigail.

Following
interviews with the suspects, Fort Bend detectives notified authorities
in Oregon where Scott Catt was connected to a string of unsolved bank robberies.

The
siblings pleaded guilty to participating in the October 2012 holdup of a
credit union in the suburban Houston community of Cinco Ranch.

In an unusual move, Sheriff Troy Nehls allowed the siblings to briefly reunite in Fort Bend, Texas.

In an emotional moment, Abigail told her brother that she did not blame him for anything and they said their goodbyes, knowing it would be years before they saw each other again.

However with time served, teenager Abigail could be eligible for parole in 18 months.

Their father blames his life of crime on his drink and drug habits.

He told 20/20: 'A lot of bad choices…were made 
under the influence of alcohol and cocaine. I'm paying the consequences, and I will pay…My children as well.'

Two siblings who 
pleaded guilty to helping their father rob a Houston-area bank last year
have received prison sentences. 
A Fort Bend County judge sentenced 21-year-old Hayden Scott Catt to 10 
years in prison on Thursday in Richmond, while 19-year-old Abigail Catt 
got a five-year prison term. Both pleaded guilty to participating in the
October 2012 holdup of a credit union in the suburban Houston community
of Cinco Ranch.
Their father, Ronald Scott Catt, is scheduled for trial Dec. 5. If 
convicted of aggravated robbery, he could be sentenced to five to 99 
years in prison. 
Prosecutors say the father is suspected of five bank holdups by himself 
before recruiting his son.
