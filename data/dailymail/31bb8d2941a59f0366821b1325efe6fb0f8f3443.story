TV food experts have clashed over new £200million EU red tape rules which force restaurants to provide details of any dishes containing one or more of 14 different allergens.

From Saturday, restaurants will be required to identify which of their dishes contain the allergens, which range from gluten to soya, milk, mustard, sesame, lupin and sulphur dioxide.

Prue Leith has described the changes as a bureaucratic nightmare, while the former chairman of the Restaurant Association, the Earl of Bradford, says the rules are ridiculously complicated.

New rules forcing restaurants to provide details of dishes containing one or more allergens from a list of 14 will be introduced on Saturday. It is thought the regime will create a punishing bill of £200million for industry

However, the TV chef Aldo Zilli supports the new regime and claims that any chefs who complain are guilty of laziness.

The industry estimates the new rules have created a punishing bill of £200million for restaurants and the catering industry in order to help the tiny minority of people who have an allergy.

Just two per cent of the nation are believed to have a diagnosed food allergy, according to research by the Food Standards Agency, which equates to around two million people.

Restaurants, cafes, fast food outlets and caterers providing meals in schools, hospitals, prisons and offices have had to check all their ingredients, train staff and create manuals spelling out which dishes contain which allergens.

The British Hospitality Association said the changes have created enormous upheaval, particularly for small restaurants and cafes.

A spokesman said: ‘The challenge will be greatest for restaurants who frequently change recipe or menu items; pop­up or event caterers; establishments with high staff turnover; and smaller establishments who may struggle with the resources to track, identify and record all allergens used from main dishes through to garnishes and drinks.

‘As a result, we calculate that it could cost the industry up to £200 million per year to implement new sourcing and management processes, adapt menus and websites and regularly brief and train staff.’

Prue Leith, the renowned cook and TV food expert, fears the changes will create red tape and make it very difficult for small restaurants to change their menus and offer a ‘dish of the day’.

She said: ‘My worry is that it will kill innovation and experimentation in the kitchen and cooking what is available daily in the market.

Soya, eggs, milk and peanuts are among the list of 14 allergens that must be identified under new rules

‘Fine for formula restaurant chains which never change their menus and have bureaucrats to work out how any milligrams of anything a dish has, but for proper cooks - a nightmare.’

But, Mr Zilli said: ‘I don’t agree. I really can’t see how it will kill innovation, how can that happen?

‘We change our menus every season. You can still create what you wish and be a chef as long as you tell customers what ingredients you are using.

‘There is laziness in this industry and it is about time we stopped that. We as chefs have to become more responsible for what we are feeding our customers.’

Mr Zilli said his own wife has an allergy to gluten, while family members have suffered reactions to dishes served in restaurants.

He is consultant executive chef for the chain of San Carlo Cicchetti restaurants, which has spent months going through recipes to identify any use of the allergens.

The chain has re-trained its chefs and created files for each dish on the menu, which can be consulted by waiting staff if a customer has a question about the use of the allergens.

Mr Zilli said the process has involved a great deal of time and expense, however he insisted the changes are necessary to protect the health of customers.

The former chairman of the Restaurant Association, Richard Bridgeman, who is 7th Earl of Bradford and runs Porters in Covent Garden, said the new allergen rules are well intentioned.

But, he complained: ‘It is typical of the heavy-handedness of the EU to bring in something like this. It is ridiculously complicated and almost impossible for most restaurants to comply with.

‘You have to audit every menu item, but also, if you buy in sauces, for example, you need to go to the supplier and get the allergen details from them, which is difficult and complicated.’

Richard Bridgeman, 7th Earl of Bradford and restaurateur, said new rules are 'ridiculously complicated'

The new rules will also apply to products sold in supermarkets where the allergens will have to be identified in bold type on the nutrition labels.

In a separate move stores will be required to offer clearer information on the origin of fresh meat. Details on where pigs, sheep and poultry are reared and slaughtered for raw meat sale will have to be on the label.

The Food Standards Agency says the new allergen rules will provide a lifeline to the estimated two million people in this country who suffer from allergies.

1. Gluten containing cereals

2. Crustaceans

3. Molluscs

4. Fish

5. Peanuts

6. Lupin

7. Tree Nuts (such as walnut, hazelnut, almond etc.)

8. Soya

9. Eggs

10. Milk

11. Celery

12. Mustard

13. Sesame

14. Sulphur dioxide

Its research found that seven in 10 of those with allergies avoid buying takeaways, due to fears about allergen. More than half of those with allergies – 53 per cent - said they avoided eating in restaurants for the same reason.

Restaurants and cafes have been given flexibility on how they provide allergy information. This can be communicated verbally through explanations by staff or signposted to where or how more information can be found on menus or in leaflets.

Allergy expert at the FSA Chun-Han Chan, said: ‘With a steady rise in the number of people suffering from food allergies and intolerances in the last decade, these new measures will make it simpler for those with allergies to buy and consume food. Allergies can be fatal for some people and this is why it is vital that food businesses give their customers information they can trust.

‘The legislation is a huge step forward for those with allergies, who should now feel confident they have a right to ask about allergenic ingredients in the foods they buy. This normalises allergen information as something that should be available at all times.’
