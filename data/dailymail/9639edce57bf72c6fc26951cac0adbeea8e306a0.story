The sons of Robin van Persie, Phil Neville and Darren Fletcher could be the Manchester City stars of the future.

Because the trio, whose father's made their name at United, have now spent over a year taking part in training sessions at the academy of their cross-town rivals.

It is not known why the talented group have been pointed in City's direction, although Shaqueel van Persie, eight, has also been training with United.

The Premier League champions, however, have recently moved to their new £200m City Football Academy and offer a clear pathway to the first team.

City's philosophy is to see that each age group adopts a similar system to that used by the first team in a bid to ensure that, should youngsters be good enough, they can easily adjust to senior level.

United, however, are well-stocked with talent at youth levels and many find it difficult to make the grade.

Van Persie Jnr, eight, has already showcased his talents to a wider audience.

In January, he starred alongside his dad in an advertising campaign for BT Sport.

The youngster is taught a number of freestyle tricks on the streets of Manchester by his old man before the pair take part in a two-vs-two game with a couple of unsuspecting locals.

Showing finishing skills his dad, who cost United £24m, would be proud of, Shaqueel scores the winning goal before the father and son team head home.

A proud Van Persie said last year: 'He plays for his local team with his friends and he got scouted and now he is playing for both Manchester United and Manchester City.

'In about a year or so he will have to make his mind up.

'He shares my passion of being involved with loads of sports.

'His timing is incredible.'

Harvey Neville, 12, plays for his school, St Bede's, where a number of City's academy stars study.

The Independent Catholic college, close to City's old Maine Road stomping ground, can boast the likes of ex-Liverpool man Neil Mellor, former Oldham captain Mike Milligan and brothers Will and Michael Keane, who currently play for United and Burnley, among its alumni.
