One of France’s most successful rap stars has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a war of words with a rival got physical.

Rohff, real name Housni Mkouboi, has admitted to being part of a a group of people who entered a Paris clothing shop, owned by another big-name rapper, Booba, and beat up a teenage shop assistant.

The two rappers, or ‘rappeurs’ as they are known in France, have been embroiled in an online feud in recent months, a rivalry which has been going on for years, according to local media.

In custody: Rohff, 36, real name Housni Mkouboi, has admitted to being part of a gang that entered a Paris clothing shop, owned by rival rapper Booba, and beat up a 19-year-old shop assistant

Rohff, 36, is said to have handed himself in after he was caught on CCTV in an Unkut shop – the clothing line owned by fellow hip hip star Booba, 37, real name Elie Yaffa.

The group entered the shop in Halles, central Paris, on Monday afternoon, and after arguing with the teenage shop assistant, they assaulted the young man.

‘They asked to speak to an employee of the shop and a fight broke out,’ a source close to the police investigation said.

The 19-year-old male employee was ‘kicked and punched’ and was rushed unconscious to the Beaujon Hospital in north Paris where he is in a life-threatening condition, French daily Le Figaro reported.

Rohff entered a police station alongside his lawyer in the early hours of Tuesday and was placed into custody, appearing before a magistrate yesterday.

The attack on the shop assistant supposedly followed a challenge by Booba, pictured, who, using Instagram, called Rohff a 'dirty queer' and told him to 'come and look for me in Paris'

Rohff’s lawyer, Francis Terquem, said that his client admitted that he had ‘taken part in a brawl’ in the shop after being insulted by the assistant.

‘My client is pleased to know that the victim is recovering,' Mr Terquem told the Independent.

‘He says that what happened can be explained by a regrettable and passing fit of annoyance… It is to be hoped that this incident will bring a little calm to the rap world.’

The attack is the culmination of a two-year-long fight between Booba and Rohff, who both have millions in record sales, which has seen the pair exchange insults in their lyrics and on social media.

It allegedly followed a challenge by Booba on Instagram after Rohff had made fun of him on Facebook.

Booba posted: 'Trouve moi à Paname. Sale Pédale' which translates into 'come and look for me in Paris. Dirty queer'.

Although mainly confined to words and threats, their fight has been compared to the infamous rivalry betweenTupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. in the mid 1990s.
