A woman is using social media to document her life with actor Bradley Cooper - in the form of a cardboard cutout.

Danielle Davies, 39, decided that if she couldn't spend her life with the Hollywood star, then she would 'just make one up'.

She's taken to Instagram and has set up a website to
 share pictures of Bradley doing chores and running errands with her 
including mowing the lawn, doing the dishes and shopping, all while 
dressed in a tasteful tux.

Good night Bradders: The fact is, while most of us don't actually live our lives with movie stars, many of us wish we did, writes Danielle Davies

You think I'd look good in this? Danielle actually met Cooper during her sophomore year at Villanova University when they were in a play together

Pick that up would you Bradley? Davies said she started working on the project, which will also be a book, to show 'how our lives continued to have these weird parallels but are ultimately nothing alike'

The mum-of-two, from New Jersey, said she picked Bradley because she actually went to college with The Hangover star.

Danielle said: 'I picked Bradley Cooper because I went to college with him for one year and we were in a play together, so I've watched his career from the get-go.

'The fact is, while most of us don't actually live our lives with movie stars, many of us wish we did.

'And so, being a forward-thinking American, I have taken the bull by the horns, the horse by the reigns, the cardboard cutout of Bradley Cooper by the shoulders, and just pretended that I do.

'If I want a life with Bradley Cooper, well, then...I'll just make one up.'

Running the red carpet: She said the pictures are 'a way for me to poke fun at how I ended up where I am and how/why my one-time stage equal has gone on to become an Academy Award nominee'

Pushing it: On her site, Davies gives a shout out to her family, including Ed, 'possibly the most patient husband in the world and relatively uninterested participant in these photos'

Davies, who counts Limitless and Silver Linings Playbook among her favorites of the actor's films, said she's never heard from Cooper or anyone in his camp

She's even got her kids and husband Ed in on the action - although her daughter keeps confusing Bradley with Mark Wahlberg.

'My husband is totally supportive and thinks it's funny. Weirdly, some of his friends ask him if he's ok with it, as if I'm hanging out around town with a real life Bradley Cooper instead of a cardboard version.

'My kids think it's fun but get a little impatient with it sometimes, especially if they think I'm not doing something they want me to do. Then they're like 'It's Bradley Cooper this and Bradley Cooper that!'

'My daughter is young enough to not realize it might be embarrassing - I even took him to her school. My son would be mortified if I did that to him!'

Tucking him in: Daneille says that she and Cooper have some 'mutual friends, friends of friends,' so she's sure he'll eventually hear about her project

Good father: Her daughter keeps referring to Bradley Cooper as Mark Wahlberg but she is in on the fun

Who am I to buck the system? If I want a life with Bradley Cooper, well, then¿I¿ll just make one up', Danielle says

She added: 'When I first unfold him, people are definitely looking at me like I'm crazy. I'm so grateful my friend, Kiesha Bond, the photographer, comes with me everywhere so I don't look like the only crazy person.'Anyway, most people end up asking what we're doing and then they love it and it's totally comfortable. The weirdest is when people don't say anything and just avert their eyes - how can you not ask?'

Danielle is currently working on a book about her unusual project and added that Bradley has in 'no way endorsed, sponsored or participated in this ridiculousness.'

A disclaimer on Danielle's website states: 'Bradley Cooper was not harmed in the taking of these photos. Nor was he consulted.'

But what would she say to the man himself?

'What would I say to Bradley? Um...hi?'

Dressed to impress: Danielle has been posting photos of her family and Cooper since April

All the fun of the fair with you: Danielle insists that no Bradley Coopers were harmed in the taking of the photos. Also, he doesn¿t know about the account

Danielle writes, 'Fortunately, Brad is a total gentleman. Unfortunately, I'm still roasting. And things are only going to get worse without air conditioning in the VW'

'Who would have thought that Bradley Cooper could be so silly? Sure enough, it was his idea to take these pics the other day while we were strolling Asbury Avenue in New Jersey. He is hysterical!' says Danielle
