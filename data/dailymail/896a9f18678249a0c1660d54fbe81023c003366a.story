Punishment: Florida mom Melissa Neale was arrested Thursday on charges that she used a stun gun to discipline her daughter

A mother in Orange County, Florida was arrested and charged with aggravated child abuse Thursday, after using a stun gun on her daughter.

34-year-old Melissa Neale had been staying with her two children at a friend's home in Orlando. Neale and her children had recently relocated from Texas.

It was the female friend she was staying with that reported the crime.

On June 9, Neale brandished a stun gun and used it on her daughter when the girl apparently didn't make oatmeal to her liking.

The witness said that Neale started yelling at the child, then grabbed the stun gun from her bedroom, cornered the girl and tasered her left kneecap. It seemed evident that the stun gun was activated since the child screamed and fell to the floor.

Neale's friend didn't want to get involved at first. But when she came across a note in the child's dresser expressing how the girl no longer wanted to live, the friend decided to contact police.

Neale on the other hand, denies that the stun gun was on. She told investigators that everyone was playing with the taser, and when she touched her child with it, it was not turned on.

She explains the bruising on her daughter's knee came from a paddling with a spoon and not the stun gun.

Arrested: Neale was arrested on Thursday, and her stun gun confiscated. She made bail late Friday evening, but her children are now being cared for by other relatives

This wasn't the only incident Neale's friend witnessed of child abuse. In the affidavit, the witness describes the way Melissa disciplines her children.

'When Melissa disciplines (the child) she will slap (the child) in the face, punch (the child) in the back of the head or will grab (the child) by the hair and pull (the child) around the room,' she said.

Neale was arrested on Thursday at the Orlando Health and Rehabilitation Center, where she works. She was released on $2,500 bail late Friday evening. Her children are now in the care of the Department of Children, which has placed them with relatives.Â
