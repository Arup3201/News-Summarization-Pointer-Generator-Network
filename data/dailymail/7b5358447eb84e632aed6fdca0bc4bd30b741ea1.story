Littlewoods has been accused of overcharging shoppers with its interest free 'buy now, pay later' option - which can lead to hard-up customers paying double what they would elsewhere. 

The weekly payment option available online spreads the payments over a number of weeks, making it more manageable for families to cope with the cost of Christmas, the retailer claims.

But it can lead to some of the most cash-strapped families paying as much as double what they should over the year once the money is totted up.

Littlewoods has been accused of overcharging shoppers with its high profile campaign interest free 'buy now, pay later' option- fronted by presenter Myleene Klass - which can lead to hard-up customers paying double what they would elsewhere

The high profile campaign - fronted by presenter Myleene Klass - tells customers: 'Whether you're buying clothes for the kids or updating your dishwasher, you can make it all manageable by spreading the cost.

'Everything you buy is available interest free – giving you more flexibility when it comes to your budget.'

But a quick internet search reveals that some of most desirable gifts this Christmas are available at a fraction of the price elsewhere.

Littlewoods offers Barbie's Malibu House for £100, but the toy was available on Amazon for just £49.99. And an IPhone 5 64gb in white, will cost £519 at Littlewoods, compared to 359.99

An Xbox one with Alien games costs £449 at Littlewoods - compared to just £339 at online retailer Very. And a Radley Bloomsbury Barrel Bag was £256, compared to £209 from the Radley website

Littlewoods offers Barbie's Malibu House for £100, giving customers the option of spreading the payments and paying as little as £1.92 over a year. 

But the toy was available on Amazon for just £49.99. 

An Xbox one with Alien games costs £449 at Littlewoods - compared to just £339 at online retailer Very. 

And an IPhone 5 64gb in white, will cost £519 at Littlewoods, compared to 359.99.  

Marc Gander of the Consumer Action Group said that it was a 'disgusting rip-off', and compared the deals to that of a 'payday loan company'.

He said: 'It's not just a marginal increase. How sad. This really does prey on poor people and it is going to hit the most cash strapped families the hardest this Christmas - like payday loans do. 

The weekly payment option available online spreads the payments over a number of weeks - but it can lead to some of the most cash-strapped families paying as much as double what they should over the year

'What a shame that Littlewoods used to be a family retailer, and now they are capitalising on this reputation and milking it. They are using the poor as a cash cow at Christmas.'

 A Littlewoods spokesman said: 'We totally refute any suggestion that Littlewoods is misleading customers with its interest-free offer. We make it very clear for Littlewoods customers exactly what they're buying and how much they're paying, with no hidden extras.

'Littlewoods customers benefit from a range of flexible payment options to help spread the cost of purchases – a simple offer that they tell us they really value and that we've been providing for more than 80 years.

'Comparing a handful of prices at one point in time doesn't tell the full story. Littlewoods has regular sales, discounts and promotions, so the headline price customers see isn't always the price they end up paying – it's often lower. We're currently offering up to 50% off a wide selection of toys, gifts, furniture and electricals, for example. We also have regular three for two offers in the run-up to Christmas.

'Online shopping means that customers can and do shop around to compare the prices of items. Our customers tell us they shop with Littlewoods because they see the good value we offer.'
