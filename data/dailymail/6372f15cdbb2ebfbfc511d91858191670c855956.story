Police have ruled out the possibility that French model Fabien Ardoin was taking a photo when he fell to his death from a cliff edge in New South Wales on Sunday, as friends have paid tribute to the 'charming' and 'ambitious' 23-year-old.

Mr Ardoin plunged 40 metres after it is believed the sandstone cliff he was standing on crumbled at Wedding Cake Rock in the Royal National Park, south of Sydney.

Police are still investigating how he fell, and said he was not taking a photo at the time and none of the seven friends that were with him were taking a photo either.

The 23-year-old Frenchman was described by friends as 'ambitious' and spent his weekends modelling and working as a topless waiter in Sydney

Meanwhile, friends and former workmates have paid tribute to the 'ambitious' French student.

His boss at Sydney topless waiter company Butlers in the Buff, Peter Suttle, described Mr Ardoin's death as 'tragic'.

'He was very charming, very intelligent, very switched on,' Mr Suttle, 31, told MailOnline.

'We got great feedback from all the clients he worked for. You know I mean most of the events he attended were hens parties and birthday parties and all the guests had a lot of great things to say about him.'

Mr Ardoin also did research at the University of Wollongong, where he was studying engineering, and was trying to find an Australian modelling agent.

He was also in talks with a friend's brother about starting work at a Sydney engineering firm.

Mr Suttle said Mr Ardoin was well-educated and well-traveled for his age and could speak Mandarin, Spanish, French and English.

Mr Ardoin had worked for Butlers in the Buff in Sydney on weekends for the past three months, and had discussed expanding the business to Hong Kong.

'He was very, very fond of Hong Kong,' Mr Suttle said.

'Being an ambitious type he could see it would work very well over there.'

The body of a 23-year-old Frenchman was recovered by police at 6.30pm on Sunday at an Australian National Heritage site in Sydney

Photographer Edmund Edwards, who did a photo shoot with Mr Ardoin six weeks ago, said he had put Mr Ardoin in contact with a friendâ€™s brother to help him get a job at an engineering firm in Sydney.

'Fabian wanted to work in Australia. He just wanted to work around the world and get different experiences,' Mr Edwards told MailOnline.

Police recovered Mr Ardoin's body after a gruelling search operation at around 6.30pm on Sunday. They were called to the scene around 10.30am.

Inspector Barry Bourchier said where Mr Ardoin fell was away from the marked walking track and that his companions were too distressed to provide statements to police.

Detective Superintendent Gavin Dengate, the NSW Police Corporate Sponsor for the safety and welfare of international students, said the incident was a sad reminder of Australia's dangers.

'It was a tragedy yesterday and what comes with Australia being regarded - and we all know - as one of the most beautiful countries in the world, if we don't respect the beauty, tragedy can happen,' he said.

Mr Ardoin had been bushwalking through the National Park with a group of seven friends from Wollongong University, including his girlfriend, when he slipped down an embankment.

It was first reported that the man had fell about 10 metres after losing his grip while hanging from a sandstone ledge on Sunday morning. They later confirmed he fell around 40 metres.

His friends witnessed him fall north of Little Marley Beach and were assisting police with their inquires.

Police found Ardoin's body with the help of State Emergency Services officers and Fire and Rescue crew.

Authorities tried to access the body by air but high winds and rough seas impeded recovery efforts.

Emergency services were called the scene at about 10.30am

Five SES officers were called to the scene and rigged anchor points into the bedrock.

Local controller of the Wollongong unit Steve Cliff said two police rescue officers abseiled down the cliff to retrieve the body on Sunday night.

Police said the 'long and difficult' operation concluded at 8.30pm and the body was sent to a morgue for examination.

The Royal National Park - also known as the 'Nasho' or just 'the Royal' - was established in 1879, according to the Office of Environment and Heritage.

It's the world's second-oldest national park and features heritage attractions, spanning 16,000 hectares.

It is an hour's drive from Sydney and Wollongong.
