Relationships between mothers and stepmothers have often been marked with jealousy, bitterness, and resentment. But one San Antonio mom decided to break the status quo by choosing to 'love and respect' the stepmother of her 14-year-old daughter.

In a post that quickly went viral on her blog, 'Women With Worth,' Candice Curry, 39, wrote 'An Open Letter to My Daughter’s Stepmom.'

The post isn't what one would expect from a divorcee, harsh words and criticisms toward the woman who 'stole her man.' Instead the mother-of-five wrote of her love and thankfulness for 29-year-old Ashley Parish, her ex-husband's wife.

In the post, Curry admits that before meeting Parish she hoped the woman would be a mean, 'old hag' who her daughter Stiles would want nothing to do with.

She planned to resent her child's stepmother, as many bitter divorcees have done in the past. 

'My plans were foiled,' Curry wrote.'You’ve accepted my daughter from the very start and have unconditionally loved both her and her daddy, that’s a true gift to all of us. 

'You’ve included my daughter in everything you do and make her feel loved and accepted. You put her relationship with her daddy above yours and only a brave and courageous woman knows how to do that with such grace.'

Text: Curry shared that she and Parish send text messages to each other, reminding the other of the love and respect they share

Parish has been co-parenting the teen with Curry for seven years, two as stepmother, New York Daily News reports.

Curry shared that she and Parish send text messages to each other, reminding the other of the love and respect they share.

Curry wrote that she never planned for Parish to be a part of her life and had a negative view of her being a part of her daughter's life. Before she met Parish, Curry thought she would be a 'terrible beast' who was 'semi unattractive' and she prayed that Stiles wouldn't look up to the woman who was with her ex-husband.

Curry wrote: 'When I first met you I’ll admit you weren’t what I had in mind and a twinge of jealousy shot through my body. You were supposed to be hideous, remember? But you weren’t, you were stunningly beautiful. You were supposed to be a mean old hag, remember? But you weren’t, you were a young, sweet woman.' 

She expressed that she is thankful to have Parish by her side, guiding her daughter, and is grateful that the two women are able to rise above their circumstances.

Filling In: Curry thanked Parish for respecting her position as the teen's biological mother and wrote that she views Parish as her daughter's mother

Curry went on to thank Parish for respecting her position as Stiles biological mother and wrote that she doesn't view Parish as a 'fill in' for her, but she sees the woman as the mother of her child.

'I promise to always respect your input for our daughter,' Curry wrote. 'I promise to never lessen the position you hold in her life or make you feel like you are not her mother. I promise to raise her to be grateful to have two strong and brave women in her life that have the courage to mother her together. 

Even though our situation is peaceful I pray that she is never in it, but if she ever finds herself here I promise to set an example for her of what co-parenting should look like. 

The Nov. 30 blog post has since been shared more than 10,000 times on Facebook and has been syndicated on many sites, according to Yahoo Parenting.  

Curry told the Daily News that her daughter was at her father's home when the 'letter' was posted and Parish cried when she read it. 

Both Parish and the teen decided to leave a comment on Curry's post: 'Candice, I don't know what to say. I am not good with words like you are and the way you express yourself. All I can say is I am crying like at the end of The Notebook ...you make me feel so special … Thank you for this letter. It made my day and I will keep it close to my heart always. Love you.'

To My Daughter’s Stepmom

I never wanted you here. You simply were never part of the plan. Growing up and dreaming of my family I never included you. I didn’t want help from another woman to raise my child. The plan was for my family to include me, daddy and our children, not you. I doubt you ever wanted me in your life. I doubt you planned to mother a child that you didn’t give birth to. I can bet that your plan for your family included you, daddy and your children together, not me or my daughter. I can almost bet that when you dreamed of becoming a mother it would be the day you gave birth and not the day you married your husband. I’m pretty sure you never planned on me being here.

But God has plans that far exceed our own and when my little family dissolved to form two families I knew you would be coming.

In my mind you would be a terrible beast and my daughter would not want you to mother her at all, ever! I was hoping that you would be semi unattractive and prayed my daughter wouldn’t look up to you. Her daddy would know that he was settling for second best. Evil swirled in me because I never wanted to face the fact that another woman would mother my child in my absence.

Then you arrived.

When I first met you I’ll admit you weren’t what I had in mind and a twinge of jealousy shot through my body. You were supposed to be hideous, remember? But you weren’t, you were stunningly beautiful. You were supposed to be a mean old hag, remember? But you weren’t, you were a young, sweet woman.

My plans were foiled.

I realized by the look on your face that meeting me was just as hard as it was for me to meet you. My heart immediately softened. Dang your kind smile! I was planing on really hating you. Why are your ruining my plan?!

I wanted to resent you but you made it impossible and I quickly grew thankful for you. 

You’ve accepted our daughter from the very start and have unconditionally loved both her and her daddy, that’s a true gift to all of us. You’ve included our daughter in everything you do and make her feel loved and accepted. You put her relationship with her daddy above yours and only a brave and courageous woman knows how to do that with such grace.

I knew when her daddy and I decided to divorce and live in separate homes there would be times when she would need me, her mommy, and I wouldn’t be there. I’m so thankful that you are there in my absence. I’m grateful that you have mercy on her teen years and never reject her. She needs a mommy at your house and you’ve done an amazing job being that for her.

You’ve respected my position as mom from the very start. I appreciate that you always check with me when you question if you are making the right decision with her. I know our situation is rare. It’s not often that a mom and stepmom text each other to remind each other that they love and respect each other. You are a gift.

Because of you and your courage to mother our daughter the way that you do, she will be a better woman. She will grow up with more love than I could have ever imagined. It wasn’t her choice to have divorced parents and even though I wouldn’t wish that on any child I am so thankful that she now has 4 parents who love and respect her and each other. She’s compassionate because of it and understands that a failure in one area can turn into a blessing in another.

I don’t see you as a fill in for when I’m not there. You are her mother when she’s with you and when she’s with me. She’s excited to call you and tell you her stories when she’s at my house and that makes my heart want to jump from my chest with joy. I fill with pride when you wrap your arms around me and squeeze for a genuine and loving hug each time we see each other.

I am extremely aware of what it looks like when a mother cannot emotionally accept her childs stepmother in their life. Gratefulness pours heavily from me that we are able to rise above anything like that and do what is truly right for ourdaughter. Thank you for being mature enough and respectful enough to co-parent with me.

I promise to always respect your input for our daughter. I promise to never lessen the position you hold in her life or make you feel like you are not her mother. I promise to raise her to be grateful to have two strong and brave women in her life that have the courage to mother her together. Even though our situation is peaceful I pray that she is never in it, but if she ever finds herself here I promise to set an example for her of what co-parenting should look like. 

Precious woman, you are a rare and beautiful gem.

God bless you and I love you.
