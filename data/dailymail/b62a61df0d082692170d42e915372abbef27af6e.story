Juve had been keen to tie the 21-year-old central midfielder down as he has become the target of several top European clubs. 

'We have just signed Paul Pogba's renewal until 2019,' Juve club administrator Giuseppe Marotta said during a shareholders meeting in Turin on Friday.

Pogba, who was named the young player of the tournament at the World Cup in Brazil in the summer, moved to Turin two years ago on a free transfer from Manchester United.

He has formed a solid partnership with Italian veteran Andrea Pirlo, which has contributed to Juve's back-to-back Serie A titles.

Marotta announced earlier his month that Juve had turned down several lucrative offers for Pogba in the summer.
