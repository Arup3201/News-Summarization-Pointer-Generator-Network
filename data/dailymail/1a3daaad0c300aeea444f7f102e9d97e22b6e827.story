A fifth of young married Brits have admitted removing their wedding ring before going out with friends or after a row with their partner, new research has revealed.

While both men and women are now more likely to wear a wedding ring than previous generations, those under 40 are also more likely to remove it, the study of 2,000 married couples showed.

The most common reasons people gave for removing their rings were that they felt they got more attention from the opposite sex without a ring, that he ring was uncomfortable and that they were cross with their other half and wanted to make a point.

One in eight said thought they would be judged as 'boring' if people knew they were married while more than a third blamed it on work and said they had a better chance of winning business if they didn't wear a band.

Men were most likely to take their ring off before socialising while women were more likely to remove their after a fight.

But more than eighty per cent of those men had been caught by their wives and only half of those had managed to talk their way out of it.

The research which polled 2,000 married couples was commissioned by Slater & Gordon as part of their annual marriage study.

Kaleel Anwar, family lawyer at Slater & Gordon, said: 'We often have clients who have been frustrated by their partner's reluctance to wear a ring, particularly in certain circumstances. I have dealt with a lot of clients whose relationships breakdown because of a lack of trust between them.

'As wearing a wedding ring has become more popular it seems that couples are more likely to take offence or consider it a sign of infidelity if someone refuses. More men than ever before have a wedding band and this research shows that women like this but unfortunately rings are easily removed and this can cause trust issues and confusion among couples.

'I have had men coming in saying they have caught their wife not wearing her ring so it isn't just men who are guilty. But it is often hard for people to understand why someone would remove a ring without a very legitimate reason.'

Despite this both men and women under the age of 40 attached more significant to wearing a wedding band and were also more likely to be hurt if their partner refused to wear one than older generations.

Unlike their fathers and grandfathers younger men see wearing a wedding band as an important part of their marriage

And unlike their fathers and grandfathers younger men see wearing a wedding band as an important part of their marriage commitment and are 27 per cent more likely to wear a band than over 40s.

The change in trend for seems to have been driven by women who place more emphasis on their partner wearing a ring and 28 per cent said they would find it disrespectful if their partner refused or took it off.

A fifth of women under 40 said they thought a man who didn't wear a ring didn't take his marriage as seriously and a quarter said it would make them suspicious.

In comparison older women didn't mind if their husband chose not to wear one and thought it was less important than wearing one themselves.

More than a third of married couples under 40 said that they would be more assured that their partner wouldn't cheat on them if they wore a ring as it would be a reminder of their commitment.

Kaleel Anwar, family lawyer at Slater & Gordon said: 'In the modern age 'double rings' are clearly more popular than ever before but it's worrying that younger people are placing so much emphasis on jewellery. A ring isn't going to stop a relationship falling apart and couples shouldn't rest easy that they are in a happy relationship just because their partner wears a ring.

'The ring is just a symbol of love and commitment, a materialistic symbol. It won't stop someone straying and essentially a ring comes off very easily.'

One in ten said they thought their wedding ring was often seen as a 'challenge' by the opposite sex with men saying they felt they got more attention from women after they started wearing a wedding band while women said they got less attention once they started wearing a wedding ring.

But nearly two thirds said that other people saw the ring and respected the fact that it meant they were in a committed relationship.
