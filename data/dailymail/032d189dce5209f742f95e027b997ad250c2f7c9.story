Les Kiss, the pioneer of the choke tackle, has rejected Wales coach Shaun Edwards' claims the technique is 'very dangerous'.

Ireland assistant coach Kiss claimed Edwards was 'wide of the mark' to label the ploy 'a blight on the game', suggesting tackling with a bid to hold players off the ground leads to clashes of heads.

Former Australia rugby league star Kiss devised the choke tackle in 2011, where defenders wrap up attackers and hold them off the ground to form a stagnant maul that wins a turnover via the scrum put-in.

The choke tackle involves a defender wrapping his arms around the neck and chest of the ball-carrier — often one who is isolated and too upright — and preventing him from going to ground. With assistance from team-mates, this can lead to the ball being stripped or a maul forming, which can produce a penalty to the defending team if the opposition collapse it in their bid retrieve the ball. If a maul forms and the ball doesn’t emerge, the defending team will win the put-in at the subsequent scrum. 

Kiss defended Ireland's right to use the perfectly-legal tactic ahead of Joe Schmidt's side hosting England in Sunday's RBS 6 Nations Grand Slam eliminator.

'Look, there has been a little bit said. I've got a lot of respect for Shaun Edwards actually but I think he's a little bit wide of the mark saying it's the cause of a lot of concussions,' said Kiss.

'By virtue of the tackle itself you have to cool your jets a bit and wrap a bit more to get under the ball, so you actually have less heat in the collision to actually affect it properly.

'When you do a lot of chop tackles there's a danger there where you can get hit by knees and hips as well, so the baseline for us, we just try to coach as good technique as we can in whatever tackle we use.

'It's one of the forms of tackle we have, we try to vary it up in a tactical sense as well, and a lot of clubs and countries are using it now as an effective weapon.

'But I don't think you can overuse it, and that's where England have been quite astute as well to mix up how they do use it.

'But I don't agree that it's a dangerous form of tackle that's for sure.'
