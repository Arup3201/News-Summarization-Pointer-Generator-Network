Yaya Sanogo is confident that the goals will come for him once he manages to score his first competitive goal for Arsenal.

The 21-year-old arrived at the Emirates from Auxerre last season but has yet to get on the scoresheet in 10 league appearances, despite Arsene Wenger's assertions that he will be a prolific forward.

Sanogo did net twice for France Under 21s as they humbled Kazakhstan on Thursday before insisting he will find his formonce he has adapted to life in the Premier League.

Dry spell: Yaya Sanogo has not scored a competitive goal for Arsenal since arriving at Emirates in 2013

At the double: The 21-year-old netted twice for France Under 21s against Kazakhstan during the week

'Football is the football, but it's a bit like going from 6th to 3rd once. It takes time to adapt,' he told L'Equipe.

'When you come out of Ligue 2 and you end up in a duel with [Man City's Vincent] Kompany, it is not an easy task.'

With Olivier Giroud expected to be out until the new year with a broken leg, Sanogo is likely to see more opportunities come his way as he competes with new signing Danny Welbeck to lead the Gunners' line.

The youngster believes that he is improving all the time and will silence his critics with goals soon.

Another level: Sanogo believes training with world class players will help his development

He added: 'On all aspects (of my game) I've evolved. When you train with great players every day, you progress.When you play big teams, it helps gain experience.

'The fans expect me to score more, but once the first one goes in they'll come. At 21, it's not easy to play striker at Arsenal.

'You have to fight every day to prove his worth. But Wenger just pushes me to continue my work will eventually pay off.'
