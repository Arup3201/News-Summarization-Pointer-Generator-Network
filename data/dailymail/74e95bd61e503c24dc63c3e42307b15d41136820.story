Michelle Knight, the longest-held and abused Ohio kidnap victim has broken her public silence to bravely face the cameras for the first time since her rescue from the Cleveland house of horrors in May.

Her captor Ariel Castro is accused of starving and punching Knight until she miscarried during her decade-long ordeal, but the 32-year-old sought to reassure the public saying: 'I want everyone to know I'm doing just fine.'

She admitted in the video released onto YouTube on Monday that she had been 'through hell and back, but I am strong enough to walk through hell with a smile on my face.'

Denying Castro any further control over her life, a smiling Knight speaking directly into the camera said,'I will not let the situation define who I am. I will define the situation.'

It was not even known that Knight had been kidnapped until she was found in Castro's home on Seymour Avenue on May 6.

Bravery: Michelle Knight made her first public appearance since her dramatic rescue from the clutches of Ariel Castro in May - to declare that she 'had been through hell and back'

'I don't want to be consumed by hatred. With that being said, we need to take a leap of faith and know that God is in control.'

Appearing alongside Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus, who Knight refers to her as 'her best friends', the three women each appeared separately in the three-minute, 33-second clip, as they thanked those who helped them and to request their privacy be respected.

All three women appear healthy and flashed their warm smiles to the camera.

The set-up interviews, were recorded on July 2 and filmed at the law offices of Jones Day in Cleveland, Ohio and put together pro bono by PR firm Hennes Paynter Communications.

Frequently referring to her faith during her brief statement, Knight expressed her dearest wish to now help others who have been through similar horrific ordeals of captivity.

'To know that there is someone out there to lean on and to talk to,' said Knight. 'Thank you for all your prayers. I'm looking forward to my brand new life.'

Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and 
Michelle Knight broke their combined public silence in the video posted 
late on Monday evening, saying the encouragement of family, friends and 
the public has enabled them to restart their lives.

Former
bus driver Ariel Castro, 52, has pleaded not guilty to a 329-count 
indictment that includes charges of kidnapping and rape - alleging he 
kidnapped the women off the streets between 2002 and 2004 and held them 
captive in his two-story home.

He
fathered a 6-year-old daughter with Berry and is accused of starving 
and punching Knight, causing her to miscarry - for which is facing the 
charge of aggravated murder of a fetus - which could carry the death 
penalty.

He was arrested on May 6th, shortly after Berry broke through a door at the home and yelled to neighbors for help.

Berry's frantic 911 call was immortalized with the words, 'Help me, I'm Amanda Berry.... I need police.... I've been kidnapped. I've been missing for 10 years; I'm here, I'm free now.'

Berry was 16 when she disappeared on April 21st, 2003. DeJesus was 14 when she went missing a year later. Knight was the first to vanish in 2002 at age 20.

Kathy Joseph, an attorney for Knight, said in a statement that the 
three women wanted to 'say thank you to people from Cleveland and across
the world, now that two months have passed.'

She said they're being recognized in public, 'so they decided to put voices and faces to their heartfelt messages.'

James
Wooley, attorney for Berry and DeJesus, also issued a statement saying 
Knight and his clients thank people for the privacy they've been given 
and do not want to discuss their case with the news media or anyone 
else.

Released from hospital five days after DeJesus and Berry, Knight has by all accounts been staying with Gina DeJesus' family because of Knight's own fractious relationship with her own.

'Thank you everyone for your love and support and donations which helped me build a brand new life.'I want everyone to know I'm doing just fine.'I may have been through hell and back, but I am strong enough to walk through hell with a smile on my face and with my head held high and with my feet firmly on the ground.'Walking hand-in-hand with my best friends, I will not let the situation define who I am. I will define the situation.'I don't want to be consumed by hatred. With that being said, we need to take a leap of faith and know that God is in control.'We have been hurt by people but we need to rely on God as being the judge.'God has a plan for all of us. The plan that he gave me is for me to help others that have been in the same situations I have been in.'To know that there is someone out there to lean on and to talk to.'I am in control of my own destiny with the guidance of God.'I have no problem expressing how I feel inside. Be positive. Learn that it is more important to give than to receive. Thank you for all your prayers. I'm looking forward to my brand new life.'

According to a friend of Gina's parents Felix and Nancy DeJesus, Knight initially rejected a meeting with her own mother, Barbara Knight, in the days after her dramatic rescue, though it is unclear whether they have met since.

Lupe Collins, a neighbor who helped the DeJesus family search for Gina since her disappearance in 2004, said in May that the family might even try to adopt Knight.

'She was Georgina's sister for ten years in that house and she's still her sister now,' Ms Collins said

'They're going to take her in as their own family member and help her.

'Michelle
doesn't want to go back to her own family because they abused her 
before she was kidnapped and they only want the money now.'

In May Ms
Collins said the DeJesus family could offer Knight the loving
household that she never had even before she was allegedly kidnapped by
Ariel Castro.

'They're a 
loving family, a giving family. Felix and Nancy will take care of her 
and make sure she gets the helps she needs,' Ms Collins said.

When Knight finally left hospital in mid-May, she thanked the public for their support and the fund created to aid the victims.

A
hospital statement said 'Michelle Knight is in good spirits and would 
like the community to know that she is extremely grateful for the 
outpouring of flowers and gifts.

'She
is especially thankful for the Cleveland Courage Fund. She asks that 
everyone please continue to respect her privacy at this time.'

It was revealed she is reportedly suffering hearing loss and facial bone damage after years of vicious beatings to her head.

Knight was 20 when she was taken off the street in 2002 and little was made of her disappearance.

Her family told police that she had run away after her young child was taken from her by the Ohio Department of Family Services.

Action News19 reported in May that Michelle's mother, Barbara returned to Cleveland after she moved to Naples, Florida, but that Knight refused to allow her mother to see her.

'I just wish that my daughter would reach out and let me know that she's there... She's probably angry at the world because she thought she would never be found but thank God that somebody did,' said Barbara.

'I don't want her to think that I forgot about her... Hopefully whatever happened between us, if something did - I hope it heals because I really want to take her back to Florida with me.'

It is still not clear if mother and daughter have reunited.

Ms Collins said Knight, who was the first of the three women to be kidnapped, was abused the most during her 11 years in captivity.

It has been claimed that she requires facial reconstruction surgery to repair the damage of repeated beatings.

'She's the most broken down physically. He broke other down the most emotionally. And he broke her down the most mentally,’ she said.

Berry, left, and Gina DeJesus, right, were well-known to people in 
Cleveland - but the disappearance of Michelle Knight drew little 
attention

Found: The women were found at this home in Cleveland on Monday after Berry managed to escape

Michelle was the first of the three victims to be abducted. She was last seen at a cousin's house near West 106th Street and Lorain Avenue in Cleveland in 2002.

But her disappearance did not receive much publicity as she was classed as a runaway and her name was taken off the missing person's database just 15 months later.

In the aftermath of her rescue it also emerged that Michelle was gang-raped and impregnated in junior high - a year before she suffered more than ten years of abuse under a kidnapper.

Her mother also said at the time of her rescue that she was looking forward to being reunited with her son, now 13, after she left hospital.
