Troubled: Chevonea Kendall-Bryan, who died after falling from a block of flats, was filmed being forced to perform sex acts on two youths, an inquest heard today

A 13-year-old girl plunged 60 feet to her death after mobile phone footage of her being forced to perform sex acts on two youths began spreading around her school, an inquest heard today.

Chevonea Kendall-Bryan, 13, had been forced into performing sex acts on the boys at a party just a month before her death in March 2011, the hearing was told.

Westminster Coroner's Court today also heard of a 'chain' of mistakes from school staff responsible for pupil welfare.

A friend of Chevonea spoke of how the video began circulating among pupils at St Cecilia's Church of England School in Wandsworth, south London, showing the tragic teen performing the sex acts.

The friend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told the hearing: 'There was girls on my bus talking about a video and Chevonea was in it.

'I saw it when I was at my friend's nan's. We were outside and some boys were next to us and they was like "do you know Chevonea?".

'They gave us the phone and said 'watch this'. I looked at it until I realised what was going on and then looked away.'

The friend, named only as E3, told the hearing the boy with Chevonea in the video was black, and that someone else was recording it from directly behind the teen so she did not know if she knew she was being recorded.

She added: 'There was a friend who was talking to me.

'She said Chevonea was getting bullied about the video because people from her school had seen or heard about it.

'Her friends were saying she weren't really happy and she was a bubbly person, but got really sad and weren't who she was.'

The inquest also heard the teenager was branded a 'narcissistic attention-seeker' by the teacher in charge of child protection.

Tragic: The hearing was told Chevonea Chevonea Kendall-Bryan, 13, was sexually-abused at a party and bullied before she died

Teacher Zach Darlington today admitted repeated failures, including giving the impression that Chevonea was a 'narcissistic attention-seeker' in a referral to a mental health authority.

The inquest heard how Mr Darlington, who was the teacher responsible for child protection at the Church of England school, did not paint a 'clear picture' of the troubled teen in a letter to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), the inquest heard.

Chevonea had been repeatedly bullied at the school by a gang of boys and had started cutting herself with scissors in class, the hearing was told.

Mr Darlington, who handed in his notice before Chevonea's death, told the inquest he was 'let down' by Wandsworth social services who failed to pass the case on to mental health services.

But he did not know the school had a social worker who would have been able to offer advice and help fill in the referral.

When asked by Westminster Coroner Bernard Richmond QC if he should have done anything differently, Mr Darlington replied: 'Yes. There are three main areas I would've done differently.

'Firstly, the delay in the sexual assault information being passed on. I waited for fuller information, but I should've let Mr Gallagher [the head teacher] know straight away.

'Secondly, I focused on the support which had already been given to Chevonea which led me to let social services fall off my radar and I shouldn't have done that.

'Finally, I hadn't painted a full picture on the CAMHS referral. I was trying to paint a picture on the behaviours Chevonea was displaying.

'I should've focused on other pupils. It would've have provided a clearer picture had I done that.'

Mr Richmond said to Mr Darlington: 'The impression you gave was that she was narcissistic and attention-seeking.'

Mr Darlington replied: 'If that is the conclusion, that was not my intention.'

However, when rumours of the sexual activity began to circulate around the school Mr Darlington said he did not know how to deal with the abuse claims.

He told the inquest he turned to head teacher Mr Gallagher for advice what to do when the allegations first came to light.

He said: 'Mr Gallagher was the person to speak with for advice.

'It was a situation I have never come across before. If he hadn't been in, I would contact him at home or contact someone else who had child protection training.

'I know it would not be an acceptable amount of delay for a child protection officer. I was slow and action should be taken as soon as possible.'

However, Mr Richmond pointed out 'nobody seemed to understand' what was going to happen to Chevonea after the allegations surfaced because she had not been taken straight to a police station for DNA testing.

Mr Darlington added: 'Contacting her family - that was our priority. Our intention was in the best interests of Chevonea and her family. Now we would drop everything.'

The hearing also heard how a school nurse did not follow up a referral over Chevonea's self-harming because of 'work demands'.

Sally Bishop was a nurse at Saint Cecilia's School and told the inquest she was qualified to deal with self-harm cases and took the work from Mr Darlington.

However, although she saw Chevonea, she never followed up on the referral to mental health services because of 'work demands'.

Evans Amoah-Nyamekye, representing the family, said to Mr Darlington: 'A teacher asked the nurse to see Chevonea because of her attendance due to health issues.

'There were reports of Chevonea cutting herself.

'There was a referral, but the nurse didn't follow it up because of work demands.'

Mr Darlington replied: 'There weren't systems in place to check things were being followed up.

'I referred this to Ms Bishop because she was in an appropriate position to deal with self-harm.'

Mr Richmond said: 'Well, she isn't because she can't prioritise.'

Although Mr Darlington was told by the nurse, who has since retired, that she was an 'appropriate' person to speak to about Chevonea's problems, he did not take any steps to make sure she was, the inquest heard.

And the teacher told the hearing it was not a child protection issue, even though the troubled teen was self-harming.

Mr Darlington added: 'There comes a time where you have to trust people's professionalism.

Â 'The impression you gave was that she was narcissistic and attention-seeking.'

Coroner Bernard Richmond QC, speaking to Mr Darlington

'If someone has a particular profession, we have to trust the professional words they have given us. It was not child protection, although it was self-harming.'

Mr Richmond said: 'There is a difference between someone who has no problems with pupils and those who self-harm.

'If Chevonea threw herself out the window, that is one of the most destructive things she can do.

'If she did, it might be because of mental health problems that started when she cut herself.'

He told the hearing the 'failure' is the 'start of a chain' of mistakes, and questioned Mr Darlington's referral to social services as it 'was not what it was meant to be'

The teacher agreed, saying it 'wasn't as full as it should be' as he has not had 'direct training' in filling out the documents.

And when he told the inquest Chevonea had become more 'positive' in Year 9, Mr Richmond said: 'What about if you were lulled into a false sense of security? You didn't chase up the referral form.'

Mr Darlington replied: 'It fell of my radar.'

The inquest continues.
