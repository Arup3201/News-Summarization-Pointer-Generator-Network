A student is hoping to become the third person in her family to be crowned a beauty queen.

Lowri Mounter, 17, from Llantrisant, near Cardiff, is aiming to become the next Miss Wales three years after her cousin, Alize, won the Miss England title.

The cousins, whose fathers are twin brothers, inherited their love of beauty queen contests from their shared grandmother, Pam Mounter, now 72, who won a pageant in her youth.

Following in their footsteps: Lowri said her cousin and grandmother are her inspiration

Pam was voted Miss Brynna - a tiny village in the Welsh valleys - back in 
1961. She was delighted when Alize, 25, was crowned Miss England in 2011
 and is now backing Lowri to be Miss Wales 2014.

Sports science student Lowri said: 'Nan was a real stunner in her day too. She likes to keep her pageant success hush hush - we've never even seen a photo but she's our inspiration.'

Alize won her title after she had moved from Wales to London as a teenager to work as a model while studying for a degree in journalism and drama. She said her life was transformed after she won the Miss England crown and she hopes her relative can be equally successful.

Lowri said she's keen to emulate her cousin - except she'd rather represent Wales. She said: 'It’s a great life to aspire to. Alize has travelled the world with pageants and works really hard. She's been to Thailand, Mauritius, Mexico, France, Dubai, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya and Japan.

'I was always aware of Alize competing in pageants and modelling. It was brilliant when she won the Miss England title. But I'm Welsh through and through and I'm really hoping to do my best in Wales.'

Support: The Annual Miss Wales pageant will be held over three days in April in Cardiff - with the family backing petite blonde Lowri

Alize said: 'I am so excited and proud for Lowri. It’s just amazing that I have inspired her enough to want to take part. And of course we both have our lovely nan to thank for sharing her good genes.

'The competition totally changed my life and took me all over the world. It was an amazing experience and I hope the competition can give Lowri a new found confidence and new friends - just like it did for me.'

Lowri
 is currently preparing for the annual Miss Wales pageant that will be 
held over three days in April in Cardiff and her cousin has offered her 
the value of her experience.

She said: 'My tips for Lowri are to be yourself, enjoy every minute and smile. It is not a catwalk - you don’t have to pout or be stick thin to win.

'The
 pageants are about celebrating femininity and curves. I think it is 
great for any young woman looking for a new valuable experience. I can’t
 wait to support Lowri on the final day.'

Cousins: Lowri, left, lives in Llantrisant, near
 Cardiff, but Alize, right, moved from Wales to London to work as a 
model while studying for a degree

Following in her footsteps: Alize said the competition was an amazing experience and she hopes it can give Lowri a new found confidence and new friends too
