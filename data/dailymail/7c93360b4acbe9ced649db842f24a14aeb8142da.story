Joe Allen is facing the biggest few days of his life – captaining Wales for the first time against Holland on Wednesday night and then getting married to fiancée Lacey-Jo Hughes on Saturday.

The Liverpool midfielder said he would ‘wing it’ with both pre-match and post-vow speeches and had left finalising the nuptials to his soon-to-be wife while he is out in Amsterdam.

But he may be in for a stern word from her on his return after describing the prospect of facing Louis Van Gaal’s team and wedded life as ‘huge challenges’.

‘I’m tying the knot at the weekend so it’s a pretty special week for me,’ said Allen. ‘I’ve got a huge game to come first and foremost and after is when it will really hit me.

His girlfriend Lacey-Jo 
Hughes got him a cockerell and posted an image of the midfielder with 
his feathered friend on Sunday morning.

‘I’m think I’m going to wing it with both speeches so we’ll have to see how it goes. I’m not sure I can think about Saturday yet, one challenge at a time.

He added with a smile: ‘They are both huge challenges. The weekend is to think about after the game. It’s one I’ve been looking forwards to for a long time.’

Joe and Lacey, whose son Alfie was born in September 2012, will get married in a ceremony on the Gower Peninsula in south Wales.
