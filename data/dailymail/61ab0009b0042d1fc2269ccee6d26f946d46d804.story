A California man has become the neighbor from hell by plastering swastika-covered Israeli and American flags across the front of his home and refusing all demands he take them down.

The Sacramento homeowner also fashioned a soldier out of wood and green cloth and strung up a Palestinian flag above the house.

He calls it his art, neighbors say, and there's nothing the police will do about it.

'This is ridiculous,' nearby resident Rick Reader told KCRA. 'Seeing this is ridiculous. That's crazy.'

Offensive: A Sacramento homeowner has plastered his house in swastika-covered Israeli and American flags

Statement? The display also has a soldier made of two-by-fours and green cloth and a Palestinian flag

Another resident told the station he wants nothing more than to tear the display down.

One man who's acquainted with the homeowner and tried to level with him. '(The swastikas) kind of cross the line for this neighborhood,' the concerned neighbor recalled saying. ' [but] he called it his art and got very defensive about it.' 

Police on Monday dropped by the house and spoke to the homeowner, but said there's nothing they could do.

KCRA also tried to speak to the man, who appeared at his front door wearing a hoodie but refused to comment.

So, for now, residents nearby remain helpless to do anything about the display.

'I am all for freedom of speech, but this is just too much,' neighbor Robbie Rose told KCRA. 'I really do want to get out of my car and rip that down.

'I don't because I do believe in being a good American, and I do believe in freedom of speech.'

One neighbor says the homeowner called the display his art and then 'got very defensive about it'

At night: The offensive display is also festooned with Christmas lights to make it an evening eyesore, as well
