Dani Alves is still not close to signing a new deal at Barcelona, according to the Catalan giants' sporting director.

Marauding full-back Alves is out of contract at the end of the season after six years at the Nou Camp and claimed earlier this month he wants a move to the Premier League.

Now Andoni Zubizarreta admits there is no breakthrough in the Brazil international's situation at Luis Enrique's side.

'We've done nothing in that respect,' he told AS.

'We're talking about the contract with him. We'll see what the road is we'll take. It's also influenced by the decision of FIFA (the transfer ban).

'The best thing is that we come to see an incisive Dani, that's important.'

The 31-year-old signed for Barca from Sevilla in 2008 for £25million and has gone on to make 304 appearances for the Catalans.

He has scored 20 goals during his time at the club, and has already made seven appearances this season. 

The 31-year-old's (left) future could be determined by FIFA's transfer ban on Barca, says the club's director
