With its chandeliers, rails of glossy clothing and attentive assistants, it’s no wonder this new clothing shop has drawn in hordes of fashion-forward women.

Inside the spacious store, they stroke elegant illusion dresses, bright tropical shifts and chic knee-length frocks.

But this isn’t an expensive designer shop, rather it’s the latest opening from the High Street’s most surprising renaissance: Bonmarché, in Uxbridge on the outskirts of London.

Flattering: Stylish and well-priced dresses are now available at Bonmarché

It couldn’t be further from the image most will have of the brand.

Bonmarché was once one of the High Street’s most forgotten — and forgettable — shops thanks to its flammable fabrics, boring clothing and cramped, messy stores filled with a mish-mash of youth styles and dowdy dresses.   

Today, there are no crop tops, sequins or sack-like frocks, just well-cut clothes at outrageously low prices that have proved catnip for older women.

It has clearly worked. Bonmarché this year announced profits were up 66 per cent on 2012-13, with online sales increased by an astonishing 84 per cent. Already, the fashion crowd has taken to referring to Bonmarché as Topshop for the over-50s.

So how on earth has one of the High Street’s most underwhelming shops turned around its fortunes in such an astonishing manner?

Perhaps, it’s because the man credited with the brand’s latest incarnation understands what this customer wants to feel when she steps into a new dress.

David Emanuel — the couturier famed as the co-designer of Princess Diana’s wedding dress and beloved for his classic glamour, worn by the likes of Joan Collins and Jane Seymour — was first approached by Bonmarché in 2007 to create a branded line for the otherwise uninspiring store. Yet it is only in the last season or so that he has felt truly happy with the quality on offer at Bonmarché.

‘Now, the collection is ageless,’ says Emanuel. ‘Better yet, we’ve brought in a brand new customer — the woman who wants comfort and a bargain, but knows that looking good is the primary consideration.’

Emanuel believes the High Street had all but betrayed these customers: ‘These women were starved of colour,’ he says. ‘These ladies were wandering round the country in beige — beige sweaters, beige macs, beige shoes, beige handbags, because that’s all that retailers offered to them.

‘My collection is filled with prints and colours that flatter older women and I’ve really thought about their body shapes and what they want.’

High point: The shop has introduced contemporary clothes that have proven more popular than the old classics

This summer’s collections mark a high point in the company’s chequered fortunes. Originally part of the collapsed Peacock Group, it was rescued from administration in January 2012 when it was bought by the private company Sun European Partners, which owns high-end designer brands such as Jacques Vert.

The new regime closed 160 stores, leaving 230 in place, and started a programme of revamping interiors with prettier lighting, better styling and staff employed for their charm and cheeriness.

It also completely revamped its collections, chasing quality while maintaining prices (the dresses pictured each cost less than £30) and gradually introducing more contemporary — but, crucially, not younger — clothes, which have proved more popular than the old classics.  

Say goodbye to beige: David Emmanuel filled his collection with colours and prints

A new team, with a new CEO — 48-year-old fashion powerhouse Beth Butterwick, former head of buying at Marks & Spencer — at its helm, set about revamping the firm.

This week, at the store in Uxbridge, I watched busy women gleefully pick up item after item, with none of the trepidation that normally comes with fearing the waist will be tiny or the hem too high for a post-50 body.

From well-to-do, expensively highlighted blonde ladies looking for smart partywear to silver-haired friends with clipped Home Counties vowels ‘oohing and aahing’ over embellished tops (two for £18), and women shopping with their husbands, it’s clear that Bonmarché caters for women with money who are tired of being alienated by the High Street.

Here, frocks come with sleeves, hems are knee-length or lower, dresses feature forgiving ruching or wrapping, and necklines are flattering rather than revealing.

The clothes are tailored to suit a post-menopausal body, rather than the waif-like teens favoured by the likes of Zara and New Look.

Lindsay Sharp, 62, from Kings Hill in Kent epitomises this new customer. Retired, with two grandchildren, she’s swapped M&S for Bonmarché.

‘Marks & Spencer was my original fallback, but they sell very boring everyday things or clothes for work or going out,’ she says. ‘The High Street has given up on me.’

Beth Butterwick says she immediately made it her mission to woo the older shopper.‘At Bonmarché our mantra is to make women over 50 feel fabulous at fantastic prices,’ she says. ‘Our typical customer is in her early to mid-60s, so we focus on fit and style that’s relevant to those ladies rather than the younger women.’

And while the store’s online success is unequivocal, their retail campaign has been ingenious. As customers desert the High Street in their hordes, Bonmarché has opened branches in upmarket garden centres around the country — the first ones were in Bicester, Oxon, Lechlade, Glocs, and Andover, Hants — next to the likes of Laura Ashley, Cotton Traders and Lakeland.

‘Garden centres are very much a whole day out — they often have free parking, restaurants and other retailers, too,’ says Ms Butterwick.

‘We’re attracting a customer that perhaps didn’t know about us. I feel as if we’re almost a best-kept High Street secret.’

But judging by the scenes in my local store, it seems the secret’s well and truly out.
