A computer programmer who killed his girlfriend and then almost got away with it after staging a cover-up has been jailed for five years.

Edward Metcalfe claimed that the death of Tracey Topliss, 47, had been a tragic accident after she fell down the stairs at their home in Hall Green, Birmingham.

A post-mortem also ruled that her death had been an accident, but after a friend of the victim told police of domestic violence within the relationship, police re-investigated the case and charged Metcalfe with murder.

Edward Metcalfe, right, who has been jailed for five years following the death of his partner Tracey Topliss, left. Her death had initially been ruled as an accident 

Today following a trial at Birmingham Crown Court, he was acquitted of murder but convicted of the manslaughter of his partner of 13 years and jailed.

The court heard how Miss Topliss, a National Grid worker, was killed on November 15 in 2013 at the couple's home.

Both she and Metcalfe, 36, had been drinking after she received the news that her mother had been diagnosed with cancer.

Hugh O'Brien Quinn, prosecuting, said that following an initial post-mortem, it had been concluded that Miss Topliss's death had been accidental.

The judge told Metcalfe, pictured, that his behaviour had been 'utterly selfish' and that he showed a 'complete lack of remorse' 

However, he added: 'That was until Mrs Sharon Wade contacted the police and told them of her concerns.

'She had been a good friend of Tracey Topliss. It was to her that Miss Topliss had complained about domestic violence from her partner.'

It was then that a second post-mortem was conducted and the court heard how the pathologist discovered an injury to the victim's cheek, consistent with a heavy punch.

Judge Paul Farrer QC said that Miss Topliss was a 'hard-working, successful and well-respected by her professional colleagues.'

Addressing Metcalfe, he added: 'There must have been some disagreement between you which caused you to lose your temper.

'You delivered a significant punch to the right side of her face. The blow caused her to fall backwards and strike her head against a table.

'You thought of nobody but yourself. Rather than trying to help her or call the emergency services, you left her lying on the floor of the hallway.

'You waited approximately for two-and-a-half hours before dialling 999.

'Your behaviour was utterly selfish and betrayed a complete lack of remorse. You showed a callous disregard for your victim.' 

However, David Crigman QC, defending said: 'What he has been found guilty of is one punch with disastrous consequences. 

'It must have happened within seconds. There was no evidence of a protracted argument. But for her falling backwards and hitting her head, the deceased would not have suffered a serious injury.' 

Metcalfe was acquitted of murder but convicted of manslaughter and jailed for five years at Birmingham Crown Court 

Metcalfe was then jailed for five years and after the hearing, Detective Inspector Harry Harrison, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Edward Metcalfe initially deceived the authorities into believing that Miss Topliss died as a result of a tragic accident. 

'He nearly got away with it. His crime was discovered as a result of community vigilance and courage.

'This goes to show that the police need the active cooperation from the community to eradicate the evil that is domestic abuse and bring offenders to justice.'
