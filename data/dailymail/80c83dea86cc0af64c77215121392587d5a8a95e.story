Â A Briton has been killed fighting in Syria, according to reports.

The man was named in reports as Abu Daigham al Baritani or Abu Daigham al-Britani - the suffix which has been adopted by those who have travelled from the UK to fight in the country.

He is said to have been part of the Rayat al-Tawheed, a collection of British combatants linked to the rebel group Islamic State of Iraq and al Sham, or ISIS.

A statement apparently issued on the Rayat al-Tawheed Instagram account said the man was killed 'in a battle a few nights ago'.

It added: 'May Allah accept him.'

Shiraz Maher, senior fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation (ICSR) at King's College London, said on Twitter that the man, who was reportedly from London, has 'featured regularly in Rayat Tawheed vids'.

The Foreign Office was unable to confirm the death.

A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: 'The UK has no representation in Syria, and we are not able to provide consular services. While we look into reports we receive of British nationals being killed or injured in Syria, these are often very hard to verify because we have no in-country presence.'

Around 400 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria over the last two years to fight, with an estimated 20 having died.

Last month 18-year-old Abdullah Deghayes, from Brighton, whose uncle is a former Guantanamo detainee, died in the war-torn country.
