They were allowed to use the corpses of executed criminals for dissection training.

But when demand outstripped supply, surgeons at the Royal London Hospital  turned their autopsy knives on those who wouldn't be missed or whose families could not afford to bury them.

After being cut up and studied, the bodies of murderers, robbers and the poor were discarded into a secret 19th century grave yard on the hospital's grounds in Whitechapel, London.

Gruesome: Archeologists discovered a mix of bones with evidence of dissection as well as skulls cut in two, after a dig at the Royal London Hospital uncovered a secret 19th century burial ground

Discovery: The team found bodies of criminals and the poor, which had been discarded into unmarked graves on the hospital's grounds in Whitechapel, London after being cut up and studied by surgeons

Visit: The archive of remains has now gone on display at the Museum of London's Doctors, Dissection and Resurrection Men exhibition, which is now open

The unmarked graveyard, in use between 1825 and 1841, lay undiscovered for 165 years until an excavation team from the Museum of London Archaeology department stumbled across it by mistake in 2006.

They discovered a mix of bones with extensive evidence of dissection, autopsy and amputation. There were skulls with their crowns sliced in two, bones wired for teaching, bits of tattooed skin, and even a slice of brain suspended in a glass jar.

Altogether, the team uncovered 262 burials, but believe they have found the remains of 500 people.

ID markers: After poring over hospital records, the Museum of London archaeologists were able to trace these pieces of tattooed human skin back to London grave robbers Thomas Williams and John Bishop

Notorious: Bishop, left, and Williams, right, turned to murder in order to keep up with demand for bodies destined for medical research. Surgeons then practised on the corpses of both men after they were executed

Criminal activity: The pair murdered a youngster known only as 'the Italian boy' after abducting him from Smithfield, a crime which helped bring about the 1832 Anatomy Act

After years of painstakingly matching bones and body tissue to hospital records, the gruesome find has gone on display in the Museum of London's Doctors, Dissection and Resurrection Men exhibition.

In the 1800s, London was awash with aspiring surgeons, keen to learn their trade. This created a huge demand for bodies.

Well-trained surgeons were essential to the capital, then the 
most populated city in the world. Yet the only legal source of bodies 
for dissection were executed criminals.

Unable to get a steady supply of corpses, respectable 
surgeons turned to unsavoury grave robbers who 
‘resurrected’ newly-buried bodies from the city’s graveyards to sell to 
medical and anatomy schools.

It was such a lucrative business that some grave robbers turned to murder in order to keep up with supply.

The exhibition includes a fragment of brain from Edinburgh grave robber William Burke, who along with partner William Hare, resorted to murder to keep up with demand.

It also includes an iron coffin from the vaults of St Bride's church in Fleet Street, which once closed was designed to be impossible to open.

The coffin, would have been vastly expensive at the time, and reflects the fear people had of being dug up once that had been buried.

Horror: A rusty man trap, used in the 19th century to deter poachers, was among the tools of the trade for the 'Resurrection Men'

Ouch: In the 1800s, London was awash with aspiring surgeons, keen to learn how to use dissecting chain hooks, left, and amputation sets, right, on dead bodies to advance their skills

The tattooed skin of either Thomas Williams or John Bishop, two London grave robbers, is also on display.

The infamous pair murdered a youngster known only as 'the Italian boy' after abducting him from Smithfield.

When the horrific revelation of the case was revealed, 
public fears peaked. Voluntary body donation seemed unlikely to meet 
surgeons’ needs. Equally no one wanted to be operated on by a bad 
surgeon.

Freedom: Whereas only executed criminals could be dissected on a table like the one pictured, the Anatomy Act ruled that bodies 'unclaimed' or 'friendless' could be given up for dissection

Fear: The Act was successful in putting the resurrection men out of business but left a long legacy of fear that falling into poverty would mean you'd end up on the dissecting table (pictured)

Need: Well-trained surgeons were essential to the capital, then the most populated city in the world

In 1832, the controversial Anatomy Act ruled that bodies 
‘unclaimed’ or ‘friendless’ could be given up for dissection. Again, it 
was clear that the burden would fall on the poor.

The Bill met strong 
opposition in Parliament, and while many MPs supported the surgeons’ 
call for cheaper training, and thought that the poor would ultimately 
benefit. In 1832 Parliament passed the Anatomy Act.

The Act was successful in putting the 
resurrection men out of business. It is estimated that 57,000 corpses 
were supplied during the first 100 years of the Act’s operation. 99.5 per cent 
were from workhouses, asylums and hospitals, showing that the burden was
indeed borne by the poorest.

The Act left a long legacy of fear – that 
falling into poverty would mean the State claiming your body after 
death.
