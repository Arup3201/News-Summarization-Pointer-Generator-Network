In the early 1970s, it was a top tourist destination, with golden sands, high-rise hotels and shopping precincts, frequented by the likes of Brigitte Bardot, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor.

Today, the streets along one of Famagusta's beach resorts, in the Varosha quarter, lie eerily silent, and have been for decades.

Further inland, surrounded by barbed wire, a plane sits forlorn on the tarmac - its tyres deflated and colours faded. 

A control tower which once watched over the busy skies around Nicosia International Airport also stands derelict.

Everything here has been frozen in time since 1974 - the year of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. 

These are the haunting scenes inside the city of Nicosia, which is now the only divided capital city in the world - separated by a UN 'green line' buffer zone. 

Around 112 miles long, it divides the Turkish-occupied northern part of the island from the independent Republic of Cyprus.

July 20 marks the 40th anniversary of the invasion, codenamed Operation Attila by Turks who opposed a union with Greece.

Only Turkey recognises the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state that was proclaimed in the north.

Tensions between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots had reached a peak in 1963 when President Makarios proposed constitutional reform.

Around this time, both communities suffered hundreds of casualties during widespread fighting - with hundreds more missing, presumed dead.

The invasion of 1974 resulted in some 37 per cent of the island being captured by Turkish forces.

UN peacekeepers have patrolled the area for years to try and prevent clashes between the populations of the two halves of the island.

In places, the neutral zone spans miles, but in the old town of Nicosia, it is barely 10ft wide - and still filled with echoes of the past...

The year that changed the island... 

Smoke rises from bomb explosions during the Turkish invasion of Cyprus on July 20, 1974

The July invasion eventually resulted in some 3 per cent of the island being captured by Turkish forces before a ceasefire was announced, while about 37 per cent of the island was occupied in the second Turkish invasion the following month
