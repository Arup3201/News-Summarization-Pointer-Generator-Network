Pensioners should have to opt in to receive the winter fuel payment, said a think-tank close to David Cameron.

Policy Exchange also advocated limiting child benefit to four youngsters per household with scaled down weekly payments after the first. 

This could save as much as £1billion over the next Parliament, it said.

The think-tank added that scrapping automatic entitlement to winter fuel payments – worth up to £300 annually – would save as much as £400million a year.

The handout aims to help those unable to heat their home properly but goes to all recipients of the basic state pension.

But, Policy Exchange said, just 10 per cent of pensioner households are in fuel poverty. 

An 'opt-in' system would make it easier for wealthy retirees to decline the benefit. Recipients of pension credit would continue to receive it automatically.

Pensioners can cancel their winter fuel payment but few do so as awareness is low.

The ideas are in Policy Exchange's welfare manifesto which is being launched tomorrow with David Blunkett, Labour's former Work and Pensions Secretary.

Steve Hughes, author of the report, said: 'Welfare policy has come a long way in the last five years, but it is still not fit for the 21st century. The system needs to be made simpler, more effective, fairer, more affordable, and should reward contribution.

'Presenting pensioners with a choice to receive their winter fuel payment could lead to hundreds of millions of pounds worth of savings, and is just one way to root out perceived unfairness.

'Other measures to make social security better suit the needs of the individual, that make spending more transparent, and take into account an individual's contributory record should be priorities for the next government.'
