A Jobcentre had to be evacuated after a car was driven through its double glass doors in what appeared to be an angry protest.

Nobody was injured when the gold Rover 75 was rammed through the front doors sending glass flying around the reception area of the Jobcentre Plus offices in Norwich, Norfolk, this morning.

It is believed that the car might have been driven into the Kiln House building in the city's Pottergate area by an angry benefits claimant.

Police were called to the office after the collision at 9.40am and arrested a local man aged in his 30s on suspicion of causing criminal damage and dangerous driving.

The man, who has not been named, was today being quizzed by officers at the Norfolk Police investigation centre in Wymondham, near Norwich.

Shoppers and office worker watched in horror as the car was apparently aimed at the Jobcentre after being driven from a car park area opposite the building.

It mounted the pavement and careered down a set of steps before smashing into the entrance for Jobcentre staff and BT workers who also have an office in the building.

Around 200 staff and customers were evacuated after the collision and the JobCentre was due to remain closed for the rest of the day.

Three crews of firefighters attended to make sure that the building was safe.

The car was still embedded in the reception area at lunchtime today and a police cordon remained in place.

A spokesman for Jobcentre Plus said there were no injuries, but the building was set to be closed for the rest of the day.

Inspector Dave Rust, of Norfolk Police, said nobody was hurt.

He said: 'We are confident that it was a deliberate act. We believe the car was parked directly opposite the building.'

Paul O'Donovan, the Jobcentre business manager, said: 'The entrance is for customers and staff. I heard a smash. It's a bit of a shock.'

The main public entrance for pedestrians attending the Jobcentre is on the side of the building.

A spokeswoman for the Department of Work and Pensions added: 'The area is being treated as a crime scene. At this stage we don't know if the driver had been involved in a dispute at the premises.'

Dena Honnor, who was attending an appointment as a sign language interpreter, said: 'I arrived for our appointment but after this incident we'll now have to rearrange.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
