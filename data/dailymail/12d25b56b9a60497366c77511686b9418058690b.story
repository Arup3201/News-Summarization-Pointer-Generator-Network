Botox empire: Apprentice champion
Leah Totton

This year’s Apprentice winner has ‘totally inadequate medical skills’ for her plan to build a ‘Botox empire’ of cosmetic clinics, experts warned last night.

Newly qualified doctor Leah Totton is ‘putting patients at risk’ and ‘using Lord Sugar as a marketing tool’, according to a leading cosmetic surgeon.

The 24-year-old beat self-styled ‘business Barbie’ Luisa Zissman to win the BBC 1  show last night.

After impressing Lord Sugar with her plan to open a series of Botox clinics offering wrinkle-busting facial fillers, Miss Totton won a £250,000 cash investment plus access to his business expertise.

But consultant plastic surgeon Nigel Mercer, a former chairman of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, warned yesterday she lacked the requisite medical skills to carry out the procedures.

He said: ‘At her level of training, she will have a basic knowledge of immunology and some knowledge of anatomy.

‘She may have done a few weeks’ training in aesthetic medicine, but that is simply not enough. It may not be quite as dangerous as putting a hairdresser in charge of cosmetic surgery, but it is still putting patients at risk.’

Miss Totton – labelled ‘Dr Totty’ by 
some of her detractors – works in the A&E department of Newham 
General Hospital in East London having qualified as a  trainee doctor at
 the University of  East Anglia only last year.

The first member of her family to go to university, she has  a sister, Jodie, 20, and a 15-year-old  brother, Dale.

Miss
 Totton was labelled a WAG when it emerged she had a four-year 
relationship with Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster until they split 
earlier this year, but she insisted she was ‘work-driven’, adding: ‘I am
 so serious. Literally Mrs Serious.’

She also boasted she had completed a course in ‘medical aesthetics’ at Harley Street in London.

But
 Mr Mercer, who is involved in drafting cosmetic surgery legislation 
across the EU, said: ‘This result flies in the face of all that we have 
been doing to keep patients safe.

Totton wants to 'provide a safe environment for women to undergo these treatments'

'There is widespread agreement in the industry that doing a short course does not make you qualified to perform cosmetic procedures.’

He added: ‘She is using Lord Sugar as a marketing tool to get her business going. This industry is very saturated, and this show has just given her a big leg up.’

In the interview stage of the show, Miss Totton was accused of ‘potentially making money out of young girls maybe not feeling good about themselves’.

But she defended her plan saying she wants to ‘provide a safe environment for women to undergo these treatments’.
