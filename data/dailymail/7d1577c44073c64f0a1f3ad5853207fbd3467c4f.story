One of TV's most popular crime series is to be revived with Oscar-winning actress Octavia Spencer cast as the star in a new take on Murder, She Wrote.

Spencer, who won critical acclaim for her role in The Help, is to take on Angela Lansbury's role as an amateur detective in a modern spin on the long-running series.

An hour-long pilot, said to be like a light version of Bones or Fargo, will feature Spencer as a hospital administrator and sleuth, who publishes her first mystery novel.

Leading lady: Angela Lansbury starred as amateur sleuth Jessica Fletcher from 1984 to 1996

The award-winning original CBS drama, which ran from 1984 to 1996, featured Lansbury as Jessica Fletcher, a Cabot Cove widow with an uncanny knack for solving grisly crimes.

In the new NBC version Spencer plays a woman whose fascination with true crime results in her having a big role in solving cases, Deadline reported.

Despite its more contemporary feel, is is believed the remake will keep the original Murder, She Wrote theme music.

Created by Desperate Housewives executive producer Alexandra Cunninghan and producer David Janollari, the new-look Murder, She Wrote will be a contemporary version of the old favorite.

Spencer, who won a best supporting actress Oscar for her role in The Help became involved with the TV series after an exploratory meeting with NBC chairman Bob Greenblatt.

'I’ve always considered myself an armchair detective and in a recent 
meeting with Bob Greenblatt, he asked me what type of character would be
 able to lure me to TV,' Spencer told Deadline.

'Naturally, I said  "J.B. Fletcher meets Colombo" ... And here we are,' she said.

Cunningham has also expressed excitement about working with Spencer on the show.

'Octavia and I are both huge true crime buffs, amateur criminologists, and fans of Angela Lansbury,' she said.

'To get the chance to reimagine Murder, She Wrote for a dynamic and multi-faceted actress like Octavia is a thrill and a pleasure.'

Lansbury received a record 12 Emmy nominations for her role as Jessica Fletcher in the show, which won a host of awards.
