Gone are the days when women were too fearful to travel the world on their own.

In fact, in recent years, the idea of the 'wandering woman' has risen in popularity, and not just among younger people.

Women of all ages are now keen to embark on a solo trip, with 60 per cent of British women revealing that they are open to the idea.

60 per cent of British women surveyed reveal that they are open to the idea of travelling by themselves 

A quarter of those surveyed between the ages of 35 and 44 were motivated to travel alone in hopes of 'finding themselves.'

And in honour of International Women's Day, MailOnline Travel is celebrating all those adventurous women trekking around the globe solo.

However, before heading anywhere - and this advice stands whether travelling by yourself or with a group - it is important to take basic safety precautions.

Travel deal site, Travelzoo, recommends doing your research ahead of time, alert your credit card company and banks that you'll be travelling and check out if and how your mobile phone will work while abroad.

Among the most popular destinations for solo female travellers? France, Spain and Canada

It's also a good idea to make a copy of your passport and other important documents and email them to yourself.

Whether you're headed to France, Spain or North America, which are all places favoured by female travellers, or somewhere entirely different, don't simply rely on the internet for recommendations. 

Speak to reliable locals, such as your hotel concierge or a local tourism office, to find out exactly which parts of town are safe for solo female travellers.
