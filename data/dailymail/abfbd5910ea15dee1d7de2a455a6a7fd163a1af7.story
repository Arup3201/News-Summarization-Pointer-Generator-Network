Calvin Connah has been jailed for killing a mother-to-be and her unborn baby daughter while driving 'aggressively and intimidatingly' in his father's BMW

It was supposed to be the most exciting time of Graham Clarke’s life.

His pregnant girlfriend was just one day away from starting maternity leave and the couple were about to move into their first home after spending months lovingly renovating it.

Instead the self-employed builder found himself surveying the devastating scene of his girlfriend and baby daughter lying side by side in hospital, after they were killed by a speeding driver.

‘My future was taken away in an instant,’ said Mr Clarke, 38. ‘Nothing will ever be the same again.’

Yesterday Calvin Connah, 22, was jailed for just five years, and could be freed in half that time.

Christina Barchetti, who was 35 weeks pregnant, died along with her unborn child after Connah, speeding at 85mph, lost control of his high-powered car and crashed head-on into hers.

The hospital administration assistant, 35, suffered terrible injuries when her Ford Ka was pushed through a wall and into woodland.

She was taken to hospital and her daughter, whom the couple had already named Bella, was delivered by Caesarean, but neither could be saved. ‘Christina was a young, beautiful girl with her whole life ahead of her,’ Mr Clarke said.

‘We had talked about getting married. I knew she was the one.

‘But seeing her in hospital with Bella next to her after they had gone was heartbreaking.

‘It felt unreal, like a bad dream. Bella looked just perfect and I was able to hold her in my arms and cuddle her, but never bring her home.

‘He’s [Connah] taken two lives  and he’ll serve just two and a half years. For us, no sentence will ever  be enough. He has given us a life sentence.

‘The pain of losing Christina and baby Bella will always be with us, the devastation this person has caused is unbearable.’

Connah killed hospital worker Christina Barchetti (pictured with her partner Graham Clarke) who was eight months pregnant, while driving on the A541 road at Pontblyddyn, Wales, on October 22 last year. The 35-year-old died at Wrexham Maelor Hospital where she worked and her baby daughter - whom she had named Bella  - was still-born during an emergency Caesarian operation

Connah (pictured at court), 22, of Leeswood near Mold, admitted causing death by careless driving, but denied causing death by driving dangerously on the A541 road at Pontblyddyn, on October 22 last year

Miss Barchetti, who worked at Wrexham 
Maelor Hospital’s medical engineering department, was on her way to her 
parents’ home in the North Wales town when the accident happened in 
October.

But as she drove 
along the A541, at Pontblyddyn, near Mold, her car was hit head-on by 
Connah, who was driving his father’s BMW 318i in the opposite direction.

During
 a three-day trial, Mold Crown Court heard that Connah had braked 
suddenly after overtaking a car at the end of a 70mph dual carriageway.

He denied speeding and claimed that he had lost control on the bend because it had been raining.

But
 witnesses told how he was driving dangerously at speeds of up to 90mph 
before the crash occurred at the start of the 50mph zone.

Mold Crown Court head that Connah was driving his father¿s BMW 318 Ti and decided to over-take another car at the end of a 70 mph dual-carriageway, the prosecution said

Tributes to the mother and baby at the scene. Their family said: 'She was so excited about expecting her first baby girl Bella. Baby Bella¿s things remain untouched in her room in her new home she made with her partner Graham'

Connah,
 of Leeswood, near Mold, admitted causing death by careless driving, but
 was found guilty by a jury of the more serious charge of causing death 
by dangerous driving.

Mr 
Clarke, also of Leeswood, said he would be lobbying Parliament to try to
 change the law with regard to the unborn victims of road smashes.

‘Connah was charged with the death of Christina, but not baby Bella,’ Mr Clarke said.

‘Because she didn’t get chance to take a breath in the outside world her death didn’t count.’
