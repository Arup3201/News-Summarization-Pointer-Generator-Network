An office manager has been arrested after performing a surgical procedure at her brother's cosmetic surgery office which left the patient in 'excruciating' pain.

Christine Patterson, 44, of Sarasota, Florida was charged with practicing medicine without a license and accused of performing a post-operative procedure on a patient after a cosmetic surgery last Friday.

On April 13, 2011, the victim received a mini-facelift from Dr. Alberico Sessa at Sarasota Surgical Arts.

Christine Patterson, 44, of Sarasota, Florida has been charged with practicing medicine without a license and accused of performing a post-operative procedure on a patient after a cosmetic surgery

According to the sheriff’s office affidavit Sessa was not in the office the next day, when Patterson – his sister, office manager and medical biller – examined the woman who had come in for her post-operation check.

Patterson unwrapped the woman’s bandages, looked at her face, and wrapped her back up, the affidavit said.

The next day the victim awoke to find her face massive swollen and so she returned to the clinic once again. Two employees later described her face as 'swollen like a pumpkin,' the affidavit said.

After contacting Sessa, who was out of town, Patterson diagnosed the woman with a hematoma. She then decided to insert a drain behind the victim's right ear to remove excess fluid.

Dr. Alberico Sessa told an investigator that he did not recall being out of the office at the time, and said that he sees all of his patients after their operations

'She diagnosed and treated a person who 
needed medical services, and she has no medical qualifications,' Wendy 
Rose of the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office told ABC Action News.

Patterson reportedly told one witness 
she had seen the procedure done ‘plenty of times.’

No pain medication was administered and the victim was in excruciating pain, according to probable cause affidavit documents.

She also told detectives that she had to see additional doctors and have additional treatment following Patterson's handy work.

The incident happened at Sarasota Surgical Arts in Florida, where Patterson worked as office manager and medical biller

Dr. Sessa told an investigator that he did not recall being out of the office at the time, and said that he sees all of his patients after their operations, the affidavit said.

The Department of Health referred the case to the sheriff’s office in July 2012, according to the affidavit.

The Sarasota County Health Department
reports no previous complaints on the Sarasota Surgical Arts office and
Patterson has no previous arrests on her record.

She has posted bail out of the 
Sarasota County jail and is prohibited from having contact with any of 
Sessa's patients or Sarasota Surgical Arts.
