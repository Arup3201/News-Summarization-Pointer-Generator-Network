Mel Greig, the Australian DJ who became notorious following a prank call during the Duchess of Cambridge's first pregnancy, has appeared on TV to complain that she still can't find work.

The 33-year-old, who has previously revealed that she was sent bullets in the post following the 2013 hoax, says people are still unwilling to give her a chance.

'The reaction in Australia has not been good,' she said. 'People aren't willing to give me a chance and a lot of people forget that I have worked in the media for 15 years.

Work: Australian DJ Mel Greig has revealed that she wants to return to the radio

'I have grown and learnt so much from the prank call that I am going to be a wiser announcer. I think it‘s important to put me back on air because I have so much wisdom now from such a tragedy.'

The DJ shot to global notoriety after making a prank call to the hospital where the Duchess of Cambridge was being treated for severe morning sickness - an incident that later led to the suicide of nurse Jacinta Saldanha.

Ms Greig, who was stricken with guilt following Mrs Saldanha's death, revealed that she suffered severe depression as a result. 

Speaking to guest presenter, Fiona Phillips on ITV's Lorraine this morning, Greig said: 'I have made it through the depression.

'It was a really hard time for about a year and a half but I did find the strength to get through that. In just one moment, it’s incredible how you can just go down there and experience feelings, emotions that you’ve never experienced before. 

'When you go through depression, the numbness, those things you feel, you don't understand what’s going on.'

So depressed did Ms Greig become, she admitted that she even blamed her childlessness on the 'karma' from the incident.

'I won’t be able to have children naturally which at one point I thought was my karma from the prank call,' she revealed.

'That was quite hard to come to terms with but I am at peace with that and I know that’s not how it works… I want to be a mother so I will do whatever I can to try and be a mother.'

Greig also spoke of the moment she came face to face with the Saldanha family during last year's inquest into the mother-of-two's death, describing the encounter as 'intense'.

'I said to the Saldanha family from the start if there is anything I could answer, anything I can do to try and help with this situation [I would.]

Tragedy: Nurse Jacinta Saldanha, who put the call through, later committed suicide

'Obviously I was one of the main causes of it, they welcomed me there [to the inquest] if I could assist.

'I didn’t meet them, we were in the same courtroom, [but] I was able to apologise face to face at the end which was a really intense moment… 

'I could see that they knew my apology was sincere and it was.'

Now the DJ, who married her long term love last November, says she hopes to be able to move on with her life and return to radio. 

'Things really are fantastic for me [and] I’m feeling great,' she said.' [The wedding] was beautiful, it was just us and it was the most privacy we’d had in a long time.

'That lifted me even further for me to want to work again and to create a good lifestyle for my husband and I.

'I didn’t worry about employment for a long time,' she continued. 'It’s just the last eight months [that] I’m like, OK I want to work again. 

'It’s been really hard. I will always be the royal hoax DJ but it doesn’t need to define me and I won’t let it define me.'
