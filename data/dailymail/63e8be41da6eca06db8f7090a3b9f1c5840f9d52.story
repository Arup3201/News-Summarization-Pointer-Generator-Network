In between their champagne-swilling lunch and glitzy dinner reception, Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha took time to visit a centre in Washington DC that helps with a cause close to their hearts.

They visited the National Children’s Center yesterday, which provides services for children and adults with developmental disabilities.

The centre was chosen for the Camerons' visit because of their interest in special needs support due to their experience of caring for son Ivan, who died aged six in 2009 after being born with a rare condition which gave him epilepsy and cerebral palsy.

The Camerons were clearly moved as they spoke with therapists and nursing staff about the help they offer to more than 500 children and young adults with a variety of disabilities.

Showing compassion - and creating a perfect photo opportunity - Mr Cameron cradled seven-month-old Abria Law, who was born three months prematurely, weighing just one pound six ounces.

The couple spoke to mother LaJoy Law, while Abria curled her tiny hand around Samantha’s finger.

The couple seemed impressed with the 
work of the centre as they were shown around by principal Sheila Maness 
and pre-kindergarten teacher Briana Rogers.

Mrs Cameron, wearing a maroon dress from Victoria Beckham’s range, held the hand of two-year-old Azahr Jackson, who has cerebral palsy, and stroked his arm as he practiced sitting upright.

She and Mr Cameron applauded warmly as he managed to sit up without assistance.

The couple had just come from a glittering lunch hosted by Vice-President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at the State Department.

They were joined by famous faces including Vogue Editor Anna Wintour and ex-Secretary of State Colin Powell.

After the visit to the Children’s Center, Mr and Mrs Cameron headed back to the White House for a state dinner, attended by dignitaries and celebrities including George Clooney, Olympian Denise Lewis and Warren Buffett.

Mr Cameron is finishing his trip to the States today with a stop in the New York City area.

The Prime Minister is expected to meet Newark Mayor Cory Booker, before making a visit to the World Trade Center site and September 11 memorial.

He’ll then meet with students at New York University before heading back to Britain this evening.

Good sport: David Cameron gets another taste of America's love of basketball, as he and wife Samantha watch youngsters play at the National Children's Center. He had watched a professional game the previous day with President Barack Obama in Ohio

Joining in: David Cameron appears to have forgotten it's basketball, not football, the children are playing
