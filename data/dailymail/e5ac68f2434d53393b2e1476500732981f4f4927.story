For people watching from their nearby apartments, a Gold Coast helicopter pilot looks to have narrowly avoided disaster while transporting water tanks from the roof of a holiday apartment building.

Having transported heat pumps and the first of three water tanks from the top of the 35 level Contessa Holiday Apartments on the Gold Coast's Main Beach without a glitch, damp insulation material added extra weight to the second tank.

The helicopter pilot - who has been transporting water tanks from rooftops for ten years - allegedly decided it would be safer to drop the tank on the river bank, but could have easily ejected it from the chopper, according to the building's manager.

While the pictures make the drop seem safe, the true terror experienced by onlookers can be seen in the video.

According to building manager David Gardner, the event had been given the all-clear by the City of Gold Coast and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.

On Monday May 12, Contessa Holiday Condominiums had planned for three water tanks and several heat pumps to be removed from the 35 level building's roof.

'Absolutely, all the safety precautions were in place,' Mr Gardner claimed.

'The pilot has had ten years experience and this is the third time in seven years that we've transported things from the top of the building.'

According to Mr Gardner, the pilot was in no real danger.

'There was a safety release in place,' he said, 'If there was the slightest sign of danger, he could have dropped the water tank.'

Despite the claims, it certainly still would have been terrifying for onlookers to witness.

Nobody was injured and no authorities are investigating the incident.
