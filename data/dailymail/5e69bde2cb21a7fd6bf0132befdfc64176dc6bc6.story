A man charged with the murder of his wife sold her clothes to buy drugs, her family claims.

Kyle Crosby, 28, was charged on Tuesday with killing his 26-year-old wife Erica Crippen Crosby, two weeks after she went missing.

Crosby, who is said to have gone on a drug binge after Mrs Crippen Crosby disappeared, sold some of her clothes to pay for narcotics, her family says.

The mother-of-two was last seen at a restaurant with her husband on New Year's Eve, posting a picture on Facebook that evening.

Crosby told Mrs Crippen Crosby's family the next day that she had gone missing, but did not inform police until a week later after they visited to check up on his daughter who had not been to school for a week, NBC New York reported. 

After he was questioned, Crosby went missing and, until his arrest on Monday, had not been seen since going on a drug binge with a prostitute, sources said.

Crosby was taken into custody by officers after a traffic stop and a short chase on foot. He was driving his wife's missing red Ford Taurus when he was stopped. 

According to a release from the Mount Laurel Police Department, investigators found several items they believe 'have evidential value in connection to her disappearance' in the trunk of the vehicle.

The couple lived together in Mount Laurel, New Jersey with their two children - Crosby's seven-year-old daughter from a prior relationship and their three-month-old baby girl - and have been married for almost a year.

Mrs Crippen Crosby left their apartment on the night she went missing without her coat, keys or purse, her family said.

Her cousin Sonay Romas-Kellan said: 'It's not like Erica to just walk out of the house and leave her kids.'

Her sister Janiya Crippen added: 'If you all were arguing you could have come to me or walked away.

'Kyle, she loved you! She loved you so much! She really wanted you to do better! He was in a rehabilitation center last month, trying to get clean. She loved him. And she wanted him to be a better father to her kid.'

Crosby was also charged with two counts of child endangerment last week. He is being held in county jail on a $1.2million bail.

According to reports, the alleged murderer has previous convictions for drug and robbery offenses. 

Mrs Crippen Crosby's body has not been found.
