A builder was impaled through the neck by six long metal bars - but is expected to make a full recovery.

Xie Mo was inches from death when the poles flew through his neck, narrowly avoiding arteries in his neck and his windpipe.

Mr Mo was working on the construction of a road bridge in Xiangyang, in the eastern Hubei province of China, last week when he felt something suddenly hit him.

The builder was working high up on the bridge when a bar straightening machine he was standing in front of malfunctioned.

Mr Mo had no time to duck as the bars fired out at him, piercing him through the right side of his neck.

He said: 'I suddenly felt numbness on the neck and fell down. 

'Thanks to the harness I wore, I didn't plummet to the ground, but suspended in the air.'

Mr Mo was rushed to hospital, where he was wheeled through to an operating theatre while holding on to the rods to stop them from moving.

Doctors had to call in firefighters with specialist cutting equipment to chop down the bars, five of which were at least four-feet long.

Surgeons then removed what was left of the poles, and incredibly they expect the builder to make a full recovery.
