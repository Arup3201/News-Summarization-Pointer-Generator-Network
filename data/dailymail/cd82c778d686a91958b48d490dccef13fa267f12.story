The FBI has released its latest statistics on violent crime in America and the dubious honor of most violent state belongs to Tennessee.

Where there is low income and low rates of education, there are higher rates of murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault, according to the numbers.

There are exceptions, though. Also on the list of 10 most violent states are Alaska, Delaware, and Maryland, which all have better income and education rates than the national average.

Scroll down for the list of 10 most violent states...

Violent: A lively shot of the famous Beale Street in Memphis may hide Tennessee's brutal truth--the state has the nation's highest rate of violent crime

Using the 2012 FBI data, 24/7 Wall St. identified the 10 states with the highest violent crime rates per 100,000 residents. In addition, they looked at each state’s income, poverty, and education statistics.

In all but a few cases, the correlation appeared clear.

Number 9 on the list Maryland may be wealthy and educated relative to the rest of the country, by extremely high crime in crime-riddled cities likely keeps the Old Line State on the list. The same is likely true for the tiny adjoining state of Delaware, which comes in at number 6 on the list.

And what of sparsely populated Alaska’s appearance on the list? The relatively better educated and richer than average Last Frontier comes in at number 3, reports 24/7 Wall St., because of its nation-leading rate of forcible rape.

Feeling lucky? Due in part to the gambling and casino industries, Nevada is the second most violent crime riddled state in the union

Surprise: Most data show that violent crime follows high poverty and low education. But Alaska is above average in those areas. Nonetheless, it has the nation's highest rate of forcible rape

For every 100,000 people in 2012, there were 79.7 incidents of the crime in Alaska.

Number 1 Tennessee had the highest rate of aggravated assaults in 2012 and was near the top for murders and robberies. Like other states on the list, Tennessee’s crime is concentrated in the more densely populated cities of Nashville and Memphis.

Using FBI data for 2012, 24/7 Wall St. assembled a list of the top states for violent crime rates per 100,000 residents. Instead of showing that with the highest populations come the highest crime, the study found that crimes like rape, assault, and murder follow trends in high poverty and low education.

1. Tennessee

2. Nevada

3. Alaska

4. New Mexico

5. South Carolina

6. Delaware

7. Louisiana

8. Florida

9. Maryland

10. Oklahoma

But unlike Maryland and Delaware, Tennessee fits the national mold with its high poverty and low education rates.

At number 2 is the state of Nevada, where the gambling and casino industries bring with them the nation’s highest robbery and assault rates. The Silver State also has some of the worst high school and college graduation rates.

Fans of the recently concluded AMC series Breaking Bad will recognize number 4 on the list. New Mexico, where violent crime is the fourth worst in the U.S., also lays claim to one of the highest rates of drug use in the nation.

At number 5 is South Carolina, where the poverty and higher education rates rank among America’s worst and where the murder rate is the fifth worst in the country.

Number 7 Louisiana is number 1 for its murder rate. The Bayou State, which has a poverty rate of almost 20 percent, saw 495 murders in 2012 and 427 people were shot in New Orleans alone.

In Florida, crime rates have been on the decline for 20 years, which is also reflected in the national trend. The Sunshine State has been improving as far as rape, murders, and other crimes and has seen improved high school graduation rates. However, at number 8, the state has quite far to rise.

Finally, Oklahoma comes in at number 10. The state had the sixth highest incidence of forcible rape last year, its worst showing in that area since 1994. Also on the rise is aggravated assault, with 337.3 such crimes for per 100,000 residents in 2012.

Urban Institute senior fellow John Roman tells 24/7 Wall St. that violent crimes occur with more frequency where people are racially segregated.

According to Roman, the more integrated a place becomes, the more markedly crime is seen to decline because those at the bottom of the economic totem pole may more easily climb into the middle class.

A list compiled using 2012 FBI crime data shows that murder, rape, robbery and assault tends to occur most often in the poorest, least educated places
