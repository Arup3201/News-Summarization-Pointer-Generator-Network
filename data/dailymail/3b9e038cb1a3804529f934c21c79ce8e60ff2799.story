A mother of two from Delaware has been charged with murder after police say she poisoned her husband to death by spiking his steroids with anti-freeze.

Jamie Baker, 44, was arrested Thursday on one count each of first-degree murder and possession of a deadly weapon in connection to the September 2013 death of her husband, 42-year-old James Baker II.

An autopsy revealed that Mr Baker had ethylene glycol - a chemical found in anti-freeze - in his system, and his death was ruled homicide by poisoning.

Following his passing, police found syringes and liquid steroids in his Smyrna home. According to detectives, he had ordered the supplements through the Internet.

Investigators searched the home again Thursday, after which police say the victim's widow admitted that she had used a hypodermic syringe to extract anti-freeze from a bottle and then injected it into her husbandâ€™s liquid steroids.

Mrs Baker, who has two young daughters, remained jailed Friday at the Delores Baylor Women's Correctional Institution without bail.

On September 16, 2013, Mr Baker was found dead in the master bedroom of his home in the  2000 block of Bryn Zion Road just outside of Smyrna.

Officers on the scene recovered pills, syringes, and a box containing several bottles of liquid steroids, the contents of which tested positive for anti-freeze.

During the months-long investigation, police were able to determine that Mr Baker had purchased the steroids online in June 2013 and had them shipped to a friendâ€™s house, The Smyrna-Clayton Sun-Times reported.

The two men then divided the bottles between themselves, and Baker stashed his share in a locked toolbox in a closet.

Police officers returned to the Bakers' home Thursday and executed a second search warrant, which ended in Jamie Baker's arrest following her confession to the crime. 

The woman did not provide a motive for her actions, according to police.

The 42-year-old man was a competitive weightlifter who worked as an environmental specialist at the DuPont Experimental Station. He and Jamie were married for 21 years.

On her Facebook page filled with family photos and pictures of her two  daughters, Jamie Baker expertly played the part of the grieving widow.

On her late husband's birthday December 6, she wrote a touching status update where she professed her feelings to her 'first and only love' and her 'best friend.'

A month later, she posted a prayer in which she wrote in part: 'I miss Jimmy.'
