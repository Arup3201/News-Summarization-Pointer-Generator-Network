An eight-month-old baby has died after her family's SUV plummeted through thin ice on Lake Minnetonka, Minnesota, on Friday.

Tabitha Markle was declared dead in the early hours of Monday morning following the accident on Friday afternoon, the Star Tribune reports.  

She was strapped in her car-seat when the SUV, driven by her father 41-year-old Jonathan Markle, suddenly gave way on the ice at Halstead Bay Bridge, Minnestrista, around 5pm.

From the scene: The lights of the SUV in which 8-month-old Tabitha Markle died on Friday were still visible after the car fell through thin ice

The spot is above a channel and known for thin ice according to KSTP.

Tabitha's mother Amanda, 31, who is reportedly a speech clinician at Richfield STEM school, and her 2 year-old sister, Isabelle, managed to escape the wreck and were helped to shore.

Jonathan Markle desperately tried to free his youngest daughter from below the ice - diving down three times before he was pulled from the water.

A retired volunteer firefighter living nearby helped in the rescue effort but they couldn't get the youngest victim out.

Firefighters managed to cut her from her car seat 15 minutes later but it was too late.

'The whole car was underwater,' Mound firefighter Paul Jolicoeur told CBS Minnesota.

'It felt like we were fighting it for hours, just finally getting her out of there.'

Danger spot: The local sheriff's office has warned drivers not to drive above channels in Lake Minnetonka despite the recent cold weather. Seven vehicles went through ice over the weekend

The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office and Orono Police Department are investigating the incident and have done blood alcohol checks on Markle who was driving back from a restaurant.

Markle, his wife and Isabelle were treated for hypothermia and are expected to make a full recovery.

They have been released from hospital.

Hennepin County Medical Examiner confirmed Tabitha's death yesterday and classified it as 'accidental drowning'

She is the first fatality attributed to thin ice in the area this season but seven other vehicles suffered the same fate on Lake Minnetonka over the weekend.

The family were driving on a channel which the Sheriff's Office particularly warned against.

'Despite the recent cold weather, channels of Lake Minnetonka remain dangerous and should be avoided,' the Sheriff's Office said in a statement.
