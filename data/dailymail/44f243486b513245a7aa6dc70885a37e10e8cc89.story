David Beckham has joined the fight against Ebola, warning that the world faces a 'race against time' to tackle 'the invisible enemy'.

In a video message to be broadcast across Sierra Leone, the former footballer urges those living in the country to 'take the right measures' to halt the spread of the killer disease.

The father-of-four says he is delivering the message after being 'inspired' by the people he met when he travelled to Sierra Leone six years ago, in his role as a Unicef Goodwill ambassador.

David Beckham has recorded a video which will be broadcast across Sierra Leone, warning people they face a 'race against time' to tackle 'the invisible enemy' of Ebola 

In the video, footage is shown of Beckham's trip to Sierra Leone six years ago, when he said he was 'inspired' by the people he met 

Beckham also recorded a second video message, urging people to donate to Unicef's Ebola appeal, so the charity can continue to tackle the crisis on the continent.

His message came amid growing anger at the lack of international support in the fight against the epidemic which is ravaging parts of West Africa.

Wearing a black Unicef t-shirt, the 39-year-old says: 'I was inspired and honoured to have met so many amazing people and see the challenges they faced in a country then devastated by civil war.

'Today, the courageous people of Sierra Leone are facing an invisible enemy. I know Unicef is on the ground working with you in your communities preventing it from spreading.'

He continues: 'The good news is this disease can be avoided if you take the right measures.

'Learn more about the life-saving instructions you can follow to protect you and your families from Ebola and together we can collectively halt this disease in its tracks. Let's start now.'

Beckham also urges people to help Unicef, by giving funds to the charity as it attempts to tackle the ever-growing problem.

He says: 'Right now, in West Africa, Ebola threatens the life of millions of people. As a father, I can't imagine what it must feel like, seeing your child suffer and feeling so helpless.

'But there is something you can do. Unicef is on the ground, working around the clock to protect children and families from this deadly virus.

'Please give Unicef the help it needs to tackle this crisis. We're in a race against time.'

The first short film has been made with the aim of breaking down the stigma and shame connected to the disease.

It will be broadcast across national TV and in town halls and community centres across the country, encouraging more people to protect themselves and seek medical help.

It will also be shown on giant outdoor screens and in football stadiums.  

The second video is an attempt to raise more money for Unicef. The charity is working to control the disease by trying to reaching families and communities with messages about  the disease.

It is trying to spread information about its symptoms, its methods of transmission, the importance of hygiene, and where to seek help.

Its teams are also distributing life-saving supplies, including gloves and chlorine, and supporting children and families affected by Ebola.

At least 3,700 children have lost one or both parents to the highly contagious virus, according to the charity.

And it is estimated the death toll from the Ebola crisis will rise to more than 4,500 lives this week from among 9,000 people infected by the deadly disease.

It has also been deemed the 'most severe acute health emergency in modern times' by the World Health Organisation. 

Dr Isabelle Nuttall of the World Health Organisation said the new numbers also show the outbreak is hitting health workers hard, with 2,700 infected and 236 dead. 

She said cases are doubling every four weeks, and the effects of the crisis are increasingly being felt beyond its epicentre in West Africa.

Meanwhile, British boarding schools are said to be monitoring the travel of their international students and their families during the school holidays.

Guidance published by the Boarding Schools Association (BSA) warns that schools with international students may be faced with concerns from parents about the potential risk of Ebola.

The BSA says parents could become worried about their child mixing with youngsters from nations affected by the virus, particularly after half-term and the Christmas holidays.

In its guidance, published online, it says: 'Some pupils may also be displaying their own "fear of contagion" behaviour having reached their own conclusions, informed or otherwise, about whether they are at risk.'

The advice suggests that senior school leaders should reassure parents, staff and pupils that the risk of Ebola in the school is low.

It goes on to say that schools with students from seriously-affected countries or neighbouring nations should follow the latest government advice if they plan to travel home during the holidays.

It says: 'This could, potentially, mean that they are advised not to travel home (in which case alternative supervision arrangements will need to be made for them) or they may face screening or other restrictions when returning to the UK.

'In issuing any specific advice for students, it is crucial this is done in full accordance with guidance from your school nurse and GP, and that any medical steps they recommend are closely followed.'

Nearly 1,000 Nigerian students and more than 400 youngsters from other parts of Africa attend UK boarding schools, according to the Times Educational Supplement (TES). 

There is also a separate guidance note from the BSA and the Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents 1,200 fee-paying schools.

The note says both organisations have been contacted by schools looking for advice on dealing with students returning from or visiting countries affected by the outbreak. 

Jo Heywood, headmistress of Heathfield, a girls' boarding school in Ascot, said that her school, which has fewer international students than many others, has issued advice on Ebola.

But she said it was no different to guidance issued in the past for other health concerns, such as swine flu. 

Mrs Heywood said: 'The measures I've put in place are to allay any fears and concerns of parents might have and to give advice to prevent scaremongering.'

BSA national director Robin Fletcher told the TES: 'With a rich mix of overseas students, you do get concerns being raised and questions being asked.

'What we are saying is that it is a managed situation... and every school has a nurse who can keep up to date with the latest official advice.'

In the first clip, he says: 'Six years ago, I travelled to Sierra Leone with Unicef. I was inspired and honoured to have met so many amazing people and to the challenges they faced in a country then devastated by civil war.  

'Today, the courageous people of Sierra Leone are facing an invisible enemy. I know Unicef is on the ground working with you in your communities preventing it from spreading.

'The good news is this disease can be avoided if you take the right measures.

'Learn more about the life-saving instructions you can follow to protect you and your families from Ebola and together we can collectively halt this disease in its tracks. Let's start now.'

In the second clip, he says: 'Right now, in West Africa, Ebola threatens the life of millions of people.
