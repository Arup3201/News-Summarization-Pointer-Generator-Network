A shocking video of university students singing sexist songs on a packed public bus has gone viral.

The mobile phone footage shows male members of the University of Stirling’s hockey club drinking beer and shouting derogatory sexual and racist chants while other passengers look on.

The students from the university in Scotland are filmed laughing at a joke about miscarriages and at one point even appeared to make mock Nazi salutes after a joke with a German-related punchline.

On board: The video has been viewed around 35,000 times on YouTube after being posted on Monday

The video - filmed on November 6 as students took the 63 bus from the university into Stirling town centre - has been viewed around 35,000 times on YouTube after being posted on Monday.

Women on board were clearly uncomfortable about the antics of the team - who were singing the traditional drinking song I Used to Work in Chicago - and one said: ‘This is quite scary.’

The students involved are now facing the prospect of disciplinary action from university bosses.

Richard Raymond, vice-president of education at the university's student union, was on the bus and has apologised for not doing more to stop the singing.

He can be seen at the start of the film walking away from the chanting group to the front of the bus. Mr Raymond also said members of the hockey team would now undergo anti-sexism training.

He told student newspaper The Tab: ‘Firstly I would like to apologise for my actions, they are not acceptable and I deeply regret it. I tried to remove myself from the incident by moving to the other end of the bus.

‘The men's hockey team will be receiving a discipline internally. We will be organising training for sports teams, which the hockey team and myself will be attending.

‘This will help start to tackle the cultural aspect of lad culture and show that it is not acceptable under any circumstances. I offer my apologies again, this is something that I am ashamed of and will have to deal with for a long time.

‘I realise that as an elected officer that even after my discipline is completed I am still accountable to the student body who have elected me into this role.’

Sean Betteridge, a student who was also on the bus, told the university's student newspaper Brig that he was embarrassed by the behaviour of the hockey players.

He said: ‘I felt generally angry. There's little you can do when there's a big group of people chanting like that on a bus. Any kind of challenge just fuels it. I was happy when I noticed it being filmed though, if you're going to spout this offensive nonsense in public then you have to expect to be held accountable.

‘Whilst I'm not happy that events like this occur, I am happy with the way the video has become a talking point over night. It's a discussion which needs to be paid attention to.’

A Stirling University spokesman said: ‘The university has been made aware of the video featuring our students and is now investigating this further. We take incidents of this nature very seriously and, where appropriate, disciplinary action will be taken.’

Last year, Glasgow University was at the centre of a sexism row after accusations that a female debator from Cambridge University was heckled.
