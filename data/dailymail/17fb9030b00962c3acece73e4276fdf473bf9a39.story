A two-year-old boy from a remote village in Guinea was 'patient zero' in the deadliest-yet Ebola outbreak, epidemiologists believe.

The boy from the village of Meliandou, Guéckédou province, suffered with fever, black stools and vomiting for just four days until he died on December 6.

Seven days later, his mother died too, followed by his three-year-old sister, who fell sick on Christmas Day and was dead before she could see the New Year.

Guéckédou sits by the borders with both Sierra Leone and Liberia. In a region where borders are porous, it gave the Ebola virus a route into three nations where medical infrastructure is under strain at the best of times.

Researchers charted the spread to nearby communities by two mourners at the funeral of the original victim's grandmother, who died January 1, and the village midwife, who died February 2, but not before infecting one of her relatives who had cared for her.

But it wasn't until March that the mystery sickness was recognised as Ebola and, by that time, dozens of people had died in eight communities in Guinea and suspected cases were emerging in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Nine months after the first suspected case, described in The New England Journal of Medicine, and the West African Ebola outbreak, centred on Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, is the worst in history with nearly 1,000 victims so far.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday it is an international health emergency likely to continue spreading for months.

The disease has put a severe strain on the health systems of affected states and governments have responded with a range of measures, including the declaration of national emergencies in Sierra Leone and Liberia.

Nigeria has also declared a national emergency after seven confirmed cases of Ebola in Lagos, the country's most populous city.

Today it was claimed that UK border staff are threatening to go on strike, angry that not enough is being done to protect them from the chance that passengers arriving in Britain are infected with Ebola.

Border Force agents at Heathrow and Gatwick airports in London are angry no measures have been put in place to protect their health from the deadly illness, the Daily Star Sunday reported.

An unnamed source told the paper there was 'panic' among border staff.

'People are scared and you can't blame them. Many aren't confident we are going to be kept safe and this has led to strike talk among the staff,' the source, described as an 'insider', said.

The report came as medics announced the first person in Europe to be treated for Ebola will be given an experimental drug to treat the deadly virus.

Spanish priest Miguel Pajares, 75, remains in isolation in a hospital in Madrid after being flown back from Liberia on Thursday.

He is believed to have contracted the disease while treating patients with Ebola at a hospital his Catholic humanitarian group runs.

Doctors were today given the go-ahead to treat him with ZMapp, which has already been administered to two American health workers repatriated to the States after falling ill with the disease.

Supplies of the drug were flown from Geneva in Switzerland to Madrid's Carlos III hospital where Mr Pajares is being cared for round-the-clock.

He remained in a stable condition today and did not have the profuse bleeding which is a sign the virus is at an advanced stage.

Mr Pajares brother Emilio said: 'We have scant news and are just waiting.

'We'll go to see him when they say we can but at the moment what interests us is that he remains stable.'

Ebola is not easy to catch. It is not airborne and can only spread through contact with the bodily fluid of victims. But it has reaped a high toll on health workers. Liberia alone has lost at least three doctors to the virus and 32 health workers.

Sierra Leone's Health Ministry said a senior physician had contracted the disease at the Connaught referral hospital in the capital, Freetown.

Dr. Modupeh Cole contracted the disease 'after treating a patient ... who was later proved to have the virus and died,' said ministry spokesman Sidi Yahya Tunis.

Dr Cole was taken to an Ebola treatment centre in eastern Kailahun district, run by medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, Dr Tunis said.

He is the latest Sierra Leonean doctor to contract the virus. The country's leading Ebola doctor, Shek Umar Khan, died of the disease last month and several nurses have also died after caring for patients.

A Guinean government minister said earlier on Saturday at a news conference that the country had closed its borders with Sierra Leone and Liberia to halt the spread of Ebola.

Authorities said the decision was taken primarily to prevent infected people crossing into Guinea, where at least 367 people have died of Ebola since March and 18 others are being treated in isolation.

However, state television later said the borders remained open, in an about-face that appeared to highlight the difficulties governments face in coordinating policy in the face of the fast-moving outbreak.

'Guinea has not closed its borders with Sierra Leone or with Liberia. It's rather that we have taken health measures at the border posts,' the television channel said.

A government source said the minister who made the original announcement had not been in possession of accurate information.

One of the deadliest diseases known to humanity, Ebola has no proven cure and there is no vaccine to prevent infection. The most effective treatment involves alleviating symptoms that include fever, vomiting and diarrhoea.

The rigorous use of quarantine is needed to prevent its spread, as well as high standards of hygiene for anyone who might come into contact with the disease.

These measures have proved hard to enforce given that Ebola has spread in rural parts of some of the world's poorest countries. The task is made harder because of mistrust of health workers in areas with inadequate public health services.

The WHO said on Friday 961 people have died during the outbreak and 1,779 have been infected. The infections and deaths have led to tests on suspected Ebola cases around the world.

Authorities in Ghana said they were testing samples from a man from Burkina Faso who died while being transported to hospital in the Upper East region.

'He had fever and was bleeding from the nose so we are testing him for Ebola because we don't want to take chances,' Yaw Manu, medical head at Bawku Presbyterian Hospital, said by telephone. 

Ghana has previously conducted about 20 Ebola tests, though none has proved positive.

Test results for a patient being treated in a Toronto-area hospital for a suspected case of Ebola are due within 24 hours, Ontario's health ministry said on Saturday. The patient recently came to Canada from Nigeria.

Authorities in Benin also said they were testing a patient for Ebola, the second suspected case in the country, while Saudi Arabia's Health Ministry said initial tests on a dead Saudi citizen suspected of having Ebola were negative.

International alarm over the spread of the disease increased last month when a U.S. citizen died in Nigeria after travelling there by plane from Liberia. Since then, other countries with no cases of the disease have taken measures as a precaution.

Zambia said it would restrict the entry of travellers from countries affected by the virus and would ban Zambians from travelling to those countries, in one of the strictest actions by any nation outside of West Africa.

Zambia's Health Ministry also advised against holding any 'international events' such as conferences and other gatherings, citing concerns about controlling potential outbreaks.

Gambia's Ministry of Transport said any planes flying to the capital, Banjul, should not pick up passengers at airports in Conakry, Freetown or Monrovia.
