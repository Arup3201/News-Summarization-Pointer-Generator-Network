In most pubs, all you'd expect to get with your pint is a packet of peanuts.

But Gallaghers Pub and Barbers in Birkenhead, Merseyside has gone the extra mile - and offers its customers a haircut and shave along with their drink.

In one end of the room in the unusual establishment there is a newly renovated bar with tables and bar stools as you would expect.

But on the other side is a barber shop - full of razors, scissors and shaving cream.

The business is owned by husband and wife Suzanne and Frank Gallagher - who are both trained barbers.

After spending years searching for the perfect location to set up their own barber shop, the pair stumbled across the pub - which was originally built in 1828.

The couple decided to follow a military-themed interior for their busines, due to Mr Gallagher's service with the Irish Guards.

After spending four months renovating their new shop, the establishment opened its doors in 2010 - and has been a huge success ever since.

The pub has even won CAMRA's Wirral Pub of the Year three times and Merseyside Pub of the Year since opening.

Mrs Gallagher, 52, said: 'We desperately wanted to buy our own premises, but couldn't find a shop that we liked.

'When
 we were looking for the perfect spot the pub came up for sale, and just
 out of curiosity we thought we'd have a look at it.

'We
 loved it as soon as we walked inside and although it had been lying 
empty for two years and was in a terrible state of disrepair, we could 
see that a barber shop would fit.'

Mrs Gallagher added: 'At first we thought the bar would just be a novelty and a bit of a bonus if people actually started using it as a pub.

'But, after seeing how popular the bar was becoming, Frank was determined to make it the best he could.

'He
 concentrated on getting in real ale and using local microbreweries, and
 it wasn't long before we were bringing in a loyal following.

'Customers at the pub do tend to use the barbers, and some even wait at the bar and end up letting other customers go in front!

Owners Suzanne and Frank who say their combination of real ale from local breweries and their barber skills means their business has been as success

'You can imagine them going home to their wives half cut and telling them there was a big queue, which always makes us laugh.'

The couple say, despite initial scepticism from locals, the pub has now really taken off.

Mrs Gallagher added: 'When we first opened the Gallaghers Pub and Barbers there was a lot of scepticism from locals, especially other pubs.

'But now everyone loves it and it's a big part of the community, already winning CAMRA's Wirral Pub of the Year three times and Merseyside Pub of the Year in 2012/13, which is fantastic!'
