Tiger Woods believes he can get his game back in shape in time to launch a challenge to win his fourth Claret Jug in The Open at Hoylake next month.

The 38-year-old looked nothing like the player who dominated world golf for more than a decade as he made his comeback after three months out following spinal surgery on Thursday and Friday.

Rounds of 74 and 75 saw him miss the cut in the US Tour’s Quicken Loans National event at The Congressional by four shots with only 13 players below him on the halfway leaderboard.

Change: Woods knows he must up his game dramatically in time for next month's Open

But Woods insists it was his rusty short game rather than his back operation which caused him to make an early exit.

‘The back is in the past,’ he said. ‘You know, I had no setbacks, no pain but I made a ton of simple little mistakes, misjudging things and missing the hole on the wrong sides and just didn’t get up and down on little simple shots. Those are the things I can correct for the British.’

Apart from saying he would be taking his two children away this week on a summer holiday, Woods gave no details of his preparations for returning to Hoylake, where he won the last of his three Claret Jugs in 2006.

His name does not appear on the entry lists for either the John Deere Classic in America or the Scottish Open at Royal Aberdeen the week before golf’s third Major of the year.

And as yet, Woods’ management team has not contacted The European Club to make available their facilities which he has used in the past to hone his links skills before The Open.

But Woods is definitely looking forward to going back and playing on the Wirral. He said: ‘I’m very excited to play that golf course again.’

Rough patch: Woods admits he's made mistakes but says 'those are the things I can correct for the British'
