One of Britain's most highly paid police officers became the first chief constable to be sacked in 35 years yesterday.

Sean Price was found guilty of asking a colleague to inquire about a job for the former police authority chairman's daughter and subsequently lying about it.

He was dismissed from his £191,905 job as head of Cleveland Police, where he had been suspended on full pay since his arrest in August last year.

But the 55-year-old will still enjoy his full pension of up to £128,000.

Mr Price was investigated following 
allegations about his role in recruiting the daughter of Dave McLuckie to a civilian post. It was 
claimed he used 'undue influence' to get her the job.

Nicholas Long, of the IPCC, branded Mr Price 'shameful' and said he had failed the force and the public.

The decision means Mr Price escapes a further inquiry into claims that he abused his force credit card and concealed the arrest of his wife, Heather Eastwood, a detective chief inspector, for being drunk and disorderly.

However, he could yet be prosecuted for corruption and fraud because he is at the centre of an investigation into how Cleveland awarded small-scale contracts for maintenance work and other routine business.

Detective
Chief Inspector Heather Eastwood was arrested by North Yorkshire Police
on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly in Northallerton on April 4 last year, before they were married.

She
was released with no further action being taken, but she and Mr Price, 
who allegedly knew of the arrest, are suspected of failing to notify 
their employer, Cleveland Police.

Circumstances
surrounding her arrest were referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) by Cleveland Police 
and Cleveland Police Authority in May and an investigation was launched.

Ms Eastwood married Mr Price this year and is expecting their baby.

The last officer of his rank to be fired
on the charge was Stanley Parr, who lost his job as Lancashire 
Constabulary’s Chief Constable in 1977, while former North Yorkshire 
chief constable Grahame Maxwell left the force, but avoided the sack, 
after admitting to gross misconduct in 2011.

IPCC commissioner Nicholas Long said Mr Price believed his position meant he could order people to do as he wished, adding that his standards have fallen far below what would be expected.

He said: 'Sean Price's attempts to mislead the IPCC investigation by lying and putting pressure on a member of staff to lie on his behalf were shameful.'

'He almost got away with his attempted deception. However, the member of staff in question showed great integrity and courage in refusing to be bullied and stood up to him by asking to submit a new witness statement to the IPCC, fully explaining Mr Price's role in this matter.

'Mr Price appeared to think his position as chief constable gave him the power to order people to do as he wished.

'A chief constable must set the standards for the police force to follow. Sean Price appears to have forgotten this and he set his own standards, which fell far below those that would be expected.

'He has attempted to intimidate and bully staff under his leadership and mislead an independent investigation.

'He has failed at that - and, most significantly, he has failed the police officers and staff he led, the police service as a whole and the public of Cleveland.'

Mr Long added that Cleveland Police Authority will drop a further misconduct hearing for Mr Price relating to 11 other matters in respect of gross misconduct - but he remains on police bail pending further inquiries in relation to Operation Sacristy, an ongoing inquiry into alleged police misconduct.

At a news conference at police headquarters in Middlesbrough, chair of Cleveland Police Authority Stuart Drummond said the 55-year-old chief constable was dismissed 'without notice'.

Mr Drummond hopes to give details of the misconduct allegations that Mr Price was due to face, but which will not be subject to disciplinary proceedings as he is no longer a serving officer, once lawyers allow him to release them.

'The two aspects that have been found against Mr Price are relatively recent, around a recruitment matter,' he said.

'There are 18 other charges of gross misconduct that will not be heard relating to periods going back five or six years.

'I would hope to release details of those charges as soon as that's appropriate, and people can make their own mind up.'

He added: 'The two counts that have been found against Sean Price relate around dishonesty and as a police officer that has got to be sacrosanct.

'As a member of the public, you need to have the utmost faith and trust in a police officer so I am really disappointed.

'Mr Price has let himself down, he has let Cleveland Police down and the people of Cleveland.'

Stuart Pudney, Cleveland Police Authority chief executive, said that as Mr Price had already served 30 years, he was still legally entitled to claim his pension.

'He will leave with his pension,' he said. 'There will be no additional payments made to him.'

Mr Price released a statement denying any wrongdoing. He said: 'Clearly, I am extremely disappointed with the result today.

'I believe the disciplinary proceedings have sadly come to an incorrect conclusion.

'When the judgment was delivered and I was offered the chance to put forward mitigation I declined - the panel was mistaken in their finding and I could not seek to argue for a lesser punishment for something I haven’t done.

'I will therefore be discussing with my lawyers over the next few days how this can be addressed.'

Mr Price is the first chief constable to be given the axe in 35 years. He maintains his innocence

He added: 'It is important that the public be aware that the CPS carefully studied this file and decided there was no criminal case to answer.

'Whilst the burden of proof at misconduct hearings is of a lower standard I am still perplexed as to why a misconduct panel could have found against me in the light of the evidence presented and the obvious hurdles that were placed in the way of me being able to lay the full facts of this case before the panel.'

He concluded his statement by adding: 'As chief constable I have been, and remain, immensely proud of the achievements of Cleveland Police and the dedication of its officers and staff.

'They have produced record falls in crime and disorder and won the confidence and support of the communities they serve, winning the title of police force of the year in 2011. I am confident this success will continue.

'On a personal note, I continue to deny any wrongdoing is this or any other matter.'

He said he will continue with a legal claim that he was unlawfully arrested and detained.
