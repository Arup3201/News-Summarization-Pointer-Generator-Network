The submarine cable network is a complex structure that stretches for more than half a million miles beneath our oceans.

Current maps of the network are complicated and hard to follow, so to simplify this behemoth, designers transformed it into a line and node graph that looks remarkably like London's iconic tube map.

Using data taken from Cablemap.info, each country is plotted as a station, and the connecting lines are colour-coded based on which consortium owns that stretch of cable.

Hover your mouse over the map below to explore the network

The Internet Tube Map, pictured, uses data taken from Cablemap.info and was created by the Oxford Internet Institute. Each station, or node, on the map represents a country, and all nodes within in the same country are combined into a single node

A submarine communications cable is a cable laid on the sea bed between land-based stations.

It is laid by specially designed ships that can carry thousands of miles of coiled cable in 
their holds and can lay it as it travels across the ocean.

The
 first commercial cables were laid in 1850 to send telegraphy traffic. Since then the 
cables have been used to send telephone traffic, and most recently data 
traffic.

Many of the 
modern cables are made of fibre optic.

Trial cables were laid in 1842 in New York harbour and were insulated with tarred 
hemp and rubber. Nowadays, cables 
are protected using polyethylene.

Traditionally the cables were owned by service providers, yet websites 
have also started buying submarine cables to control their networks including Google and Facebook.

The network carries almost 95 per cent of the internet we use every day.

Any stations within the same country have been combined into a single node, and many short links were deliberately excluded to make the visualisation simpler. 

For example, it doesn’t show the intricate network of cables under the waters of the Gulf of Mexico.

Countries recently listed as Enemies of the Internet, in the 2014 report of Reporters Without Borders - due to censorship and surveillance laws -
are highlighted, too.

A key on the right-hand side of the map reveals what the icons and colours mean.

The centrality of each station was calculated using PageRank algorithm - an algorithm search engines use to highlight how authoritative a website is, for example.

On the Internet Tube Map, this authority translates to regions where the network is most influenced by governments, or susceptible to weakness and disruption.

In creating the map, researchers Mark Graham and Stefano De Sabata from the Oxford Internet Institute discovered the U.S. is the most connected country in the world, with cable landing at points along both coasts.

The connecting lines are colour-coded based on which consortium owns that stretch of cable.

The map uses data taken from Cablemap.info, pictured. The U.S is the most connected country in the world, with cable landing at points along both coasts. The second and third most central parts of the global network are located in the UK and Senegal

On the other side of the Atlantic, the second and third most central parts of the global network are located in the UK and Senegal.

The UK has been a pioneer in laying submarine 
cables since the second half of the 19th century, and still controlled almost half of the world’s submarine cables in the 1920s.

Senegal is where most of the 
southern Atlantic cables land, and it will be followed by Nigeria when 
new cables are switched on in the region later this year.

Looking at the network more closely, Alexandria in Egypt is the world’s most central node, immediately followed by Singapore and Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates.

In January, Washington-based firm TeleGeography plotted all of these cables on a much more detailed interactive map, pictured, that similarly reveals who 
owns the networks, their landing points and how far these cables can 
stretch

The city of Fortaleza in Brazil, and the town of Bude in Cornwall, are the most central single points in Latin America and Europe respectively, while Accra in Ghana dominates the Sub-Saharan African list.

'The importance of being central in the submarine fibre-optic cable network is twofold,' explained the researchers.

'On the one hand, internet users in central countries tend to have faster and cheaper connections to the Internet - there are no countries with low-cost Internet access that aren’t also relatively well-connected.

'But we’ve also seen how certain central countries in the network have a history of engaging in surveillance of onternet traffic: as revealed by Edward Snowden and described by the Guardian and the Washington Post, for both internal and foreign surveillance.'

TeleGeography's Submarine Cable Map, pictured, was updated for 2014 and features a total of 285 cable networks. Of this 285, 263 are currently in service, while 22 should be in use by the end of 2015. It was based on data from Global Bandwidth Research

In 2006, submarine cables carried just one per cent of traffic - an increase of 94 per cent in just eight years, according to official figures from the International Cable Protection Committee.

Since 2012, the amount of submarine cables have almost doubled from 150 to the current figure of 285.

Of this 285, 263 cables are currently in use, while 22 are set to be in use by the end of 2015. When a cable is laid but not in use it is called a 'dark' cable, but once in use it becomes 'lit'.

It shows active and planned submarine cable systems and their landing stations.

Traditionally the cables were owned by service providers, yet websites have also started buying submarine cables to control their networks. For example, Google is part of the consortium that manages the Southeast Asia-Japan cable, left, and Facebook is part of the consortium that manages the Asia Pacific Gateway, right

The first cables were laid in 1850 to send telegraphy traffic. Since then they have been used to send telephone traffic, and most recently data. This map shows how the Eastern Telegraph company's network looked in 1901. In 2006, submarine cables carried just one per cent of traffic, this figure is now around 95 per cent

There is only a limited amount of space for cable on land, and this makes the space expensive to rent, and highly competitive.

Since 1850 engineers and telecom companies, instead, have been taking advantage of the vast land beneath the oceans to lay cables. 

The first cables were used to send telegraphy traffic. Since then the cables have been used to send telephone traffic, and most recently data traffic.

Many of the modern cables are made of fibre optic, to increase the size and speed at which the information can be sent, and are only 2-inches thick.

This image shows a cross section of a modern submarine communications cable. It is around 2-inches thick. The labels are: (1) Polyethylene, (2) Mylar tape, (3) Stranded steel wires, (4) Aluminium water barrier, (5) Polycarbonate, (6) Copper or aluminium tube, (7) Petroleum jelly and (8) Optical fibres

For
 example, Google is part of the consortium that manages the Southeast 
Asia-Japan cable, and Facebook is part of the consortium that manages 
the Asia Pacific Gateway.

Reports
 in December stated that by owning private networks the companies can 
stop governments from being able to track what they get up to.

As of 2010, submarine cables link all the world's continents except Antarctica.

Cables can be broken by fishing trawlers, anchors, earthquakes, turbidity currents, and even shark bites.

If
 cables need to fixed, a repair ship will drop a buoy in the location of
 the break and a submersible is sent down to repair them.
