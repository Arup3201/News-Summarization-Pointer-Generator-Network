Want to emulate Myleene Klass' flawless beauty look? Now you can because the glossy star has launched a beauty collection for Littlewoods.

After the success of her first range, Myleene has unveiled her second offering and says it's full of  must-have products that will 'perfectly compliment any girl’s make-up bag'.

Myleene promises that she's included everything you need to achieve a 'polished and glamorous' look just like hers.

Get the look: Myleene Klass, who is famed for her radiant glow, has created her second range of beauty products for Littlewoods and wears her own clothing designs for the e-tailer in the promotional shots

Priced between £12 - £30, each of the bronzers, lipglosses, eye colours and nail varnishes have been embossed with an animal print palette - a style Myleene often champions in her fashion choices.

The mother-of-two's new collection has been inspired by the strong, beautiful women in her life with her favourite shades named after those closest to her.

Personal touch: The mother-of-two has named each one of her pieces after a woman close to her heart and says her liglosses and bronzers are perfect accompaniments to any woman's make-up bag

Animal behaviour: Myleene is known for her love of animal print when it comes to fashion and now she's projected it onto her beauty range too

Selling power: Littlewoods are pleased to have Myleene back on board after strong sales - they sold one brow kit every thirty minutes and her lipsticks sold over 30,000 units last time around

She's named the trio of highly pigmented lipsticks after the three most important women in her life.

Magdalena, named after her mother, is a soft and subtle pink, whilst Hero and Ava, named after her two daughters, are classic shades of nude and red.

Speaking about the seven-piece range, she said: 'I love having classic products in my make-up bag that can create multiple looks and that was a focus for me in creating my second collection.

'For me, it’s all about wearing colours that work well with your skin tone and my new products suit all complexions. For this season, I wanted to immortalise all the strong women in my life into my beauty collection, which is why each shade is named after a special woman in my life.' 

Littlewoods are pleased to have the 36-year-old back on board after strong sales - they sold one brow kit  every thirty minutes and her lipsticks sold over 30,000 units. 

The star, who has been designing clothes for the e-tailer for years, also used the opportunity to promote her latest designs in the photoshoot.
