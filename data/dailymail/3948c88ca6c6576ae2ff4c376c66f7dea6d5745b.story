Holidaymakers could be paying as much as five times more for express airport transfers compared to the cheapest option available, according to a new study.

The research looked at the fastest and cheapest transport options available to people travelling to and from 20 major European cities. 

For more than half of the airports, travellers are paying as much as five times more for services such as Heathrow and Gatwick Express - that were on average just a third slower than the cheaper public transport option. 

Paying a premium: The Heathrow Express is 356% more expensive than opting for public transport

The study, by travel money specialist No.1 Currency worked out the prices and travel times for a single trip from the airport to the city centre.  

For people arriving at Heathrow Airport, the Heathrow Express offers a speedy journey into central London in just 15 minutes. But  a one-way ticket for two cost £52.

The London Underground takes four times as long but a couple will only pay £11.40 for tickets, so the express option costs an extra £40.60 or a premium of 356 per cent.

Both options are still cheaper than taking a taxi, unless you are travelling with four paying adults - in which case taking a cab would work out a much better value option than the Heathrow Express.

The biggest price discrepancy was found in Stockholm. The Arlanda Express train from Stockholm Airport to the city centre cuts down the transfer time by more than half compared to the cheapest option, a local bus, but the ticket price is 419 per cent more expensive. 

For visitors to London, taking the Heathrow Express or the underground work out cheaper than catching a cab

The cheaper (and slower) option: Taking the Tube in London to Heathrow will save travelling couples over £40

A couple will pay almost £45 for two single tickets for the 20-minute journey, compared to just £9 on a local bus which takes 45 minutes.

And travelling from the Swedish airport to the city centre will pay around £30 for a taxi, which is £15 cheaper than taking the express train.

The Leonardo Express from Rome's Fiumicino AIrport, costs £22.26 for two, while the local bus costs just £6.36  - but take a good book, as it takes more than an hour.

While from Dublin Airport, the airport express bus - £11.12 for two passengers - costs more than twice the local bus (£4.76), and the transfer time is only 22 per cent faster.

The research revealed, that in 16 of the 20 European city airports surveyed, it is possible, if you take public transport, to transfer from the airport to the city centre for less than £10 for two people.

In some cities, the cheapest option of getting to the airport was also the fastest option. 

A train from Geneva Airport costs £4.76 for two and takes just six minutes - compared to  £22.11 for taking a taxi.

In others, tourists will want to pay a premium for the ease, speed and stress-free travelling of the express airport service.

Paris offers a 50-minute train connection from Charles de Gaulle airport to Gare du Nord station for just £14.81 for two passengers. 

And while a local bus service offers the journey for less than £10 one-way, tourists do face a journey of two hours through a city notorious for its bad traffic.

Simon Philips, head of retail, No.1 Currency, said: 'There are so many transfer options available for travellers when they arrive at their destination airport that it can be difficult to know which one to choose.

'The choice really comes down to whether you want to get to your city centre destination as quickly as possible or as cheaply as possible. 

'In some cases it is possible to achieve both, but our research reveals that those airports that offer a service operated by the airport itself, you will pay a considerable premium for the shorter transfer times.

'It's always worth checking out the transfer options from your destination airport before you travel, because you may find you can get discounted prices by booking in advance.'
