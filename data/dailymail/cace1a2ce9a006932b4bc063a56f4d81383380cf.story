A mansion built for a Turkish Sultan's top army commander could be yours - if you've got £75million to spare.

The 150-year-old Zeki Pasha Palace boasts 27 bedrooms, eight bathrooms and four kitchens and 33,000 sq ft of living space.

The five-storey manor in Istanbul was built by French-Ottoman architect Alexander Vallaury for Musir Zeki Pasha, who was a minister under Sultan Abdulhamit II in the late 19th century.

The 150-year-old Zeki Pasha Palace sits on the waterfront of Istanbul's Bosphorus strait and is on the market for £115million

With
rooms covered from ceiling to floor in marble, plenty of art and antiques, plus a secluded Japanese-style garden with pools and fountains to care for, the new owner will inherit 20 members of 
staff to maintain the property's upkeep.

And there's sure to be plenty of space to choose from to avoid the noise from passing traffic.

The house sits under the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge over the Bosphorus strait, which connects the European and Asian sides of Turkey.

A 430ft pier juts out into the water as a parking spot for yachts with a private boathouse on hand.

Vallaury designed a home for the Sultan following the success of Zeki Pasha Palace, and built palaces for other army commanders.

Musir Zeki Pasha commissioned the baroque mansion from Vallaury, who went on to design palaces for other army commanders in the Turkish forces

The chance to live in one of his creations is rare as many have since become museums and galleries.

A spokesman for Sotheby's Realty said: 'This is a wonderful property that has received quite a large amount of interest.

'It was built by French architect Alexandre Vallaury, who helped to rebuild Istanbul after following the immense 1894 earthquake, and is a true gem.'

Visitors won't need to bother with crossing the bridge - they can sail up to the house's 430ft pier in their yachts and drop anchor

Many of Vallaury's homes are now privately owned or museums and galleries, so it is a rare chance to live in a property designed by the French-Ottoman architect
