Glowing brightly on the tree, these colourful fairy lights look like they could have been bought yesterday.

But they were actually purchased on a trip to Woolworths – 45 years ago.

Vina Shaddick has displayed them proudly in her living room every Christmas since 1969, and has only had to change one bulb.

Mrs Shaddick believes the lights (pictured left and right) could be the oldest Christmas lights in Britain

She bought the lights during a lunch-time trip to Woolworths - and shelled out just £3 for the set 

They remain in place all year round because they are now too fragile to disassemble, but the 65-year-old says they are ‘still going strong’ - and reckons they are the oldest Christmas lights in Britain. 

‘I can still remember buying them,’ said Mrs Shaddick, who lives in Plymouth with her 35-year-old son Ross. 

‘Word had got round that Woolies had a special delivery of lights from Germany.

'It was the second year I was married and I went in my lunchtime. They hold a lot of memories for me.’

It is estimated that the lights – which cost just £3 for the set – have been shining for nearly 30,000 hours.

This equates to around three years of continuous use. 

And while they may be doing remarkably well for their age, they are far from the oldest decoration in the house.

Mrs Shaddick also has a Christmas tree bought by her mother-in-law in the 1950s, which she displays in another room.

Talking about her lights previously, she commented: ‘They really don't make them like this anymore.

‘I can't imagine a set bought today - which are much pricier - lasting as well as these.

'I guess you could say I've had my money's worth from them.

'They've never let me down and it's looking as though they might outlast me now.’

Her son Ross, 35, a music teacher, said: ‘I can't remember a time before the lights, they've always been around.

‘They are older than me and have been here all my life. It's been a constant and I hope they keep on working.’

And lights are not the only thing that have lasted since that shopping trip.

Mrs Shaddick said: ‘I remember buying some wine glasses and tumblers at the same time. We still have those wine glasses.

‘You wouldn't expect to buy glasses now and expect to still have them in 40 years.’
