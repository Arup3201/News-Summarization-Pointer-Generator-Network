Leicester Cityâ€™s Premier League preparations got off to a flyer on Tuesday night with an emphatic victory over Ilkeston Town at the New Manor Ground.Captain Wes Morgan got the first, before Chris Wood, a David Nugent brace, Tom Hopper and an own goal completed the scoring for Leicester.

But there was something for Northern Premier League side Ilkeston to cheer about late on as Andre Johnson secured a consolation for the home side.

Battle: Leicester's Marc Albrighton fights for the ball with James Reid of Ilkeston

Ilkeston: Smith, Shaw, Reid, Wright, Maguire, Lane, Morgan, Chettle, Duffy, Richards, Williams

Leicester First Half: Schmeichel, Pearson, Konchesky, James, Morgan, Sesay, Barmby, Taylor-Fletcher, Wood, King, Albrighton Second Half: Hamer, De Laet, Schlupp, Wasilewski, Moore, Watson, Drinkwater, Hammond, Knockaert, Nugent, Hopper

It was the perfect start to 
pre-season for the Foxes, who are preparing for their first Premier 
League campaign since being relegated in 2004.

Nugent and Wood will have been pleased to have gotten onto the score sheet with Leicester having just completed a deal for Leonardo Ulloa from Brighton.

The Argentinian, who turns 28 this weekend, was in attendance at the friendly after penning a four-year deal at the King Power Stadium, and could feature in Sunday's pre-season friendly against Everton in Thailand.

Nigel Pearson will be hoping now that he has the strikers at his disposal who will bring the goals that will keep Leicester in the Premier League.
