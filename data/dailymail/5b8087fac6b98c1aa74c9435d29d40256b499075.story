Google has finally released the wearable 'Glass' computer it hopes could form the next massive shift in technology.

Google Glass was delivered to the first customers outside the company today, after developers signed up last year to be the first to buy the £1,000 ($1500) 'Explorer edition' of the gadget.

The firm says the high resolution display is the equivalent of a 25 inch high definition TV viewed from eight feet away - but warns that users will have to recharge their glasses every day.

What's in the box: The first developers received their Google Glass 'explorer editions' today, after signing up last year to buy the glasses. They are supplied with a 'sunglass' visor for the controversial glasses, which have already been banned by some establishments

Adjustable nosepads and durable frame fits any face.

Extra nosepads in two sizes are included.

High resolution display is the equivalent of viewing a 25 inch high definition screen from eight feet away.

12 GB of usable memory, synced with Google cloud storage. 16 GB Flash total.

One full day of typical use.

Some features, like Hangouts and video recording, are more battery intensive.

MyGlass companion app enables GPS and SMS messaging.

One of the first to receive his Glass was software developer Brandon Allgood, who posted a picture of himself wearing the sunglass visor entitled 'Terminator!' to his Google+ page.

'This is what you get in the box: two visors, a bag, power cord and of course Google Glass!' he wrote.

Hundreds more are expected to be picking up their Glass in the coming days.

To set up their glasses, users have to scan a special barcode to link their glasses to their Google account.

The firm says the 'durable frame fits any face,' but also supplies nosepads in two sizes.

It
has also revealed the first details of the display used in Glass, 
claiming it is the equivalent of watching a 25-inch, high definition screen from 
eight feet away.

The glasses will also have 12 GB of usable memory, synced with Google's cloud storage.

The search giant also admitted the Glass battery may not last a full day for some users.

'Some features, like Hangouts and video recording, are more battery intensive,' it said.

Google also released the APIs programmers will need to create their own Glass apps.

The search giant is also set to open stores to show off Glass, according to 9to5mac.

'An extremely reliable source has confirmed to us that Google is in the process of building stand-alone retail stores in the U.S. and hopes to have the first flagship Google Stores open for the holidays in major metropolitan areas,' it said.

'Google feels right now that many potential customers need to get hands-on experience with its products before they are willing to purchase.'

According to Buzzfeed, 'Google is planning to open retail stores in Los Angeles and San Francisco, according to a source familiar with the plans.

'The company has already begun hiring staff, who are being trained in how to explain and market Google products — including Glass — in stores.'

However, the Glass technology has already caused controversy.

A
group of anonymous online protestors are targeting Google and users of 
the search engine company’s soon-to-be released Google Glass in an 
attempt to censor the high-tech eyewear and also make a little money in 
the process.

The group known as Stop The Cyborgs is ‘fighting the algorithmic future one bit at a time,’ according to its website banner.

The
site’s founders, who say they are working anonymously to keep Google 
from spying on them, also say they believe the new Google-manufactured 
eyewear will promote a world in which ‘privacy is impossible'.

Google Glass is set to go on sale within days - but only to selected developers who attended the firm's annual conference last year

Apple have also released the app lucky owners will use to set up the electronic eyewear

Glass is expected to go on sale to consumers later this year, costing around £800

The people behind the anti-cyborg movement say there is no way someone can ever know for sure that another person wearing Google Glass is not recording their every word and movement.

‘Gradually people will stop acting as autonomous individuals when making decisions and interacting with others, and instead become mere sensor/effector nodes of a global network,’ the site states.

The protestor group additionally runs a 'Stop The Cyborgs' store on its site, where online visitors can buy T-shirts and stickers that say ‘Google Glass is banned on these premises,’ and show images of Google Glass being crossed out.

However, on the site the group admits: 'Please note that Google has not yet officially released the details of how Google Glass will work', adding that their privacy concerns are 'educated speculation based on public press articles'.

Glass will also be available in five different colours when it eventually goes on sale to consumers

How Glass works

Martin Missfeldt, a German designer, said he created this graphic to show people how the Google system works.

'Google Glass is a technical masterpiece,' he said.

'It combines numerous functions and features in a very small unit. In addition to phone and camera (photo, video), it offers Internet connection, including GPS.'

'The core feature of Google Glass is a visual layer that is placed over the reality ('augmented reality'), explains Missfeldt.

'This layer opens a door to amazing new possibilities.

'Google Glass contains a 
mini-projector, which projected the layer via a clever, semi-transparent
prism directly on the retina in the eye.

'Because of this the image, even though it is so close to the eye, is sharp and clear.

'You can move the front part of the Google Glass easily to optimize the focus.'
