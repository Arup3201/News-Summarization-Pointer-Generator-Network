Jabeen Younis is believed to have been murdered during a savage attack at her home

A mother-of-two has been murdered during a savage attack at her home, while her young son was in the house, according to reports.

Jabeen Younis, 30, was discovered by police at her Oldham home with serious neck injuries.

A 20-year-old woman was arrested in the early hours of today on suspicion of murder. She remained in police custody for questioning this afternoon.

Jabeen is understood to have recently separated from her husband five months into their marriage and friends said she wanted a fresh start in her native Pakistan.

Neighbours and friends have paid tribute to Jabeen, who worked in a furniture store in Oldham town centre, calling her a 'loving mum' and a 'friendly and lively character'.

Nearby residents described dramatic scenes as police cars raced to the scene after receiving a 'concern for welfare' call yesterday morning.

Her son, believed to be around seven years old, was seen being led from the house by officers shortly afterwards.

A large section of the residential street was cordoned off throughout the day as forensics officers combed the house for clues and carried away clothes and other household items in bags.

Police have said a murder investigation was underway to establish the full circumstances surrounding her death.

Superintendent Catherine Hankinson, from Oldham police, said: 'A young woman has tragically had her life taken from her. We are doing all we can to establish the exact circumstances leading up to her death to provide some much needed answers for her family, who are clearly devastated by what has happened.

'The team of detectives dedicated to investigating this woman’s death are currently following a number of lines of inquiry, and we are keen to hear from anyone who has any information that may assist this investigation.

'We do not believe there are any immediate concerns for the safety of the wider community, but extra patrols will remain in the area to provide reassurance to local people'

Jabeen is understood to have moved to Oldham around 10 years ago from Pakistan shortly after the birth of her daughter.

Having previously been divorced, she remarried at the end of last year but friends said she had recently ended the relationship.

Extra patrols have been stepped up in the area and a team of detectives are working to establish the circumstances leading up to the death

Police have said a murder investigation was underway to establish the full circumstances surrounding her death.

One friend, who did not wish to be 
named, said he had spoken to her less than 24 hours before her death. He
said: 'Her marriage was over and she wanted to go back home to get away
from it.

'I’d been on the phone with her helping to arrange it all and she was looking to leave very soon. She was a nice girl who just wanted the best for her children and for them to lose their mum is just unbelievably tragic.'

Another friend said: 'She was just a normal young woman enjoying her life, she loved her kids and she went out to work every day, she just got on with things.

'She loved her fashion and was always really well-turned out, she was a happy, lively character who once you’d met her, she’d put a smile on your face.

'She was funny and a very strong person who wouldn’t put up with any nonsense, she enjoyed her life in Oldham and made it her home.'

Ian Whitbread, 45, said: 'I used to see her on my way to work and I’d stop and have a chat with her from time to time, she was a really nice girl.

'She just seemed like someone with everything to live for.

'She was clearly a popular girl and she seemed to have a lot of friends around her, she just always seemed really happy and it’s awful to think someone like that can just be taken away so suddenly.'

Neighbours spoke of their shock after initially being alerted by teams of police racing up the quiet street.

Abdul Alam, 20, said: 'I was asleep but I could suddenly hear all these sirens going up to the top of the street and police were trying to get into the house.

'It's really shocking because it's quite a quiet community where people look out for each other and people just don't know what to do now because they can't believe this has happened.

'I only knew her to say hello to but she seemed like a friendly, happy person. It's a real tragedy.'

Sara Begum, 23, said: 'I saw all the police come tearing up the street. There were probably two or three cars and vans and you knew straight away it was an emergency.

'I saw them taking her little boy out of the house and then you knew it was something quite serious and people were just waiting to hear the full extent of what's happened.

'I think a lot people will be quite worried that something like this has happened on their doorstep. It's usually quite a peaceful area and for someone to come and do something like this to someone in her own home is sickening.'

A post-mortem examination to establish the cause of death is due to take place today.
