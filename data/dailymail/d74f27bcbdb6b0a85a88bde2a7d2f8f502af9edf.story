'Torture': Kyle McArdle, 26, was Tasered five times by police and has won a five-figure compensation award

Two police officers have been sacked after an innocent man was Tasered five times in their van, it was revealed last night.

Kyle McArdle, 26, said he passed out from the excruciating pain inflicted by the 50,000-volt weapons after he was dragged from the street.

He was shot in the chest, stomach and leg at point-blank range as up to three officers assaulted him.

After four years of wrangling, in which Merseyside Police insisted they did nothing wrong, PC Simon Jones and PC Joanne Kelly were fired for gross misconduct.

A third officer involved in the incident, Sgt Charlie Tennant, had already been sacked in 2011 for gross misconduct over a separate matter.

The case, believed to be the first in which officers have been fired for misusing a Taser, raises questions about the trend to arm police with the potentially deadly weapon.

Last night, Mr McArdle said: ‘I have never come across such brutality, and for that to be at the hands of the police – people I would have expected to trust – has been really disturbing.

‘I wasn’t offering any resistance when they launched an unprovoked attack, hitting me on the head and choking me.

'When I raised my hands in self-defence I was Tasered five times and dragged to a police station like a criminal.’

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said the officers used unnecessary force and ignored national guidelines.

Mr McArdle was arrested during a night out for his brother-in-law’s birthday in Liverpool on December 19, 2009. He was grabbed by the three officers after relieving himself in an alley.

The car engineer, who works at the Ford Halewood plant, was dragged into a police van.

He was Tasered twice – with barbs 
attached to charged wires being fired into his body – and had the 
pistol-like Tasers themselves pushed directly into his body three times and 
discharged, an agonising technique known as a ‘drive stun’.

One officer ripped the metal barbs from his body, despite rules that this must be done by a doctor.

Mr McArdle said: ‘I just sat on the seat and then I felt a blow to the side of my head from one of the officers, then another blow and I was repeatedly insulted.

‘At no stage was I resisting or even trying to defend myself.

‘Then I was hit again on the temple and choked by one officer using his forearm. I was petrified. I couldn’t breathe and thought I was going to pass out. In self-defence I pushed the officer and that’s when all hell broke loose.

‘One got her Taser out and drive-stunned me to the shoulder and then another aimed his Taser at me. I put my hands out and said, “I’m not doing anything”, and then he shot me. It was absolute agony. All my muscles tensed like I was in cramp – it was excruciating.

Questions remain over the proliferation of Tasers among the UK's police forces. Use of the weapon has proved fatal in the past

‘Then the driver turned round and Tasered me on the shin.

‘I couldn’t believe it - it felt like I had been kidnapped for having a wee in an alley and now I was being tortured in the back of the van. I was in agony and in shock.

‘I tried to grab the Taser to stop it happening again and he Tasered me in the hand and then I was Tasered yet again. I must have passed out because when I came round I was in handcuffs.’

Mr McArdle was charged with assault but was acquitted in September 2010 by a magistrate who questioned the officers’ account.

But his ordeal was not over as he fought the force for justice.

The IPCC upheld two appeals as the force first recommended ‘management advice’ over the arrest and then said the Taser use was ‘necessary and proportionate’.

It criticised police for not giving enough weight to the victim’s account or CCTV footage contradicting what the officers said.

Finally, a misconduct hearing led to the sacking of the two officers.

Mr McArdle, who had not been in trouble with police before, has won a five-figure compensation sum after suing the force. He said: ‘None of those officers belonged on a police force. They were a disgrace.’

His mother, Christine McArdle, 56, said: ‘To be Tasered while offering no resistance is torture.’

James Dipple-Johnstone, of the IPCC, said: ‘There is public concern over the increase in Taser use. Incidents such as this do nothing to alleviate that concern.’

Merseyside Police said: ‘All officers issued with Tasers are required to complete training and annual re-qualification.

'Since this incident, Merseyside Police has introduced a procedure which requires each use of Taser to be reviewed by a senior officer, prior to submitting details to the Home Office.’
