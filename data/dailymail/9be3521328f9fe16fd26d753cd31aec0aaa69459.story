Prince Charles received a warm welcome from the crowd when he visited the Gloucestershire town today - with the exception of one highly emotional young lady.

But the heir to the throne was unflappable when confronted with a screaming baby girl as he toured a shopping centre in Cheltenham, smiling at the girl as she wailed in the arms of her mother, who looked delighted to be talking to the Prince.

His visit to the Regent Arcade, which has been given an external makeover to create a new Regency-inspired facade, was the last engagement of a particularly busy day for Prince Charles.

Earlier, he donned a pair of heavy duty gloves to help lay a commemorative stone in a dry stone wall during a tour of the Royal Agricultural University's new rural innovation centre near Cirencester in Gloucestershire.

The heir to the throne is a keen dry stone wall maker and joked with some of the students he met about the tricky job of finding stones to fit.

During his visit the prince met students, staff and industry specialists at the centre based at the university, which has the Prince as its president.

During the visit Prince Charles received a number of gifts for his grandson, George

The centre provides students with the
 opportunity to experience the practical side of farming and agriculture
 and Charles' Prince's Countryside Fund has provided
 £50,000 to support a three-year project helping 90 local young people 
not in education, employment or training to learn a range of skills from
 dry stone walling to blacksmithing.

Student Harry May, who helped Charles fix the stone plaque, said afterwards: 'It's great that places like this exist as I didn't have the qualifications to go to university but this way I can still gain valuable experience relevant to the local job market.'

Before visiting the university the prince toured a project helped by his Prince's Countryside Fund, which aims to protect rural life in the Wiltshire village of Sherston.

Charles toured Sherston Old School, a Grade II-listed building that has been given a new life housing the village shop and a host of local businesses.

The building had stood empty since February 2005, when it was made redundant by the opening of a new village school, but a community group was set up to safeguard it and increase local employment.

Funds were raised to secure the premises and the post office and general store set up. A £50,000 grant from The Prince's Countryside Fund enabled the team to finish renovations and reintroduce six business units.

The prince met Mike Johnson, a director of Sherston Old School Community Interest Company, who said: 'The success of the Old School to date has been entirely due to the initiative, vision and perseverance of the community over an extended timescale.

'We are so grateful for The Prince's Countryside Fund for giving us the final amount needed to create the business units.

'As a result the handsome building continues to be at the heart of the local community and we're successfully reintroducing businesses into the village centre. Community regeneration is key to preserving and protecting rural life.'

Victoria Elms, manager of The Prince's Countryside Fund, said: 'Today's royal visits highlight the wide range of projects the Fund supports from community-based shops to funding valuable training in rural skills. These projects are doing vital work to protect, improve and sustain rural life.'
