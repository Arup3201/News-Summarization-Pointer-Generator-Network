Jailed: Ian Lewell, 41, has been sentenced to two years in prison after taking a PC hostage and threatening her and others with knives and an infected syringe

A career criminal covered in tattoos has been jailed for two years after holding a woman police officer hostage with five knives and a syringe he said was infected with hepatitis C.

Ian Lewell, 41, who had taken pills and injected himself with medication, refused to release PC Laura Furby after a late-night stand-off on Guernsey in October last year.

PC Furby entered his bedroom to negotiate with him but he pulled out the weapons and said he had hepatitis C and she and anyone who came near him could 'have it too'. 

Her colleagues donned riot gear and mounted a rescue attempt but Lewell hurled a fire extinguisher as they tried to climb the stairs.

Pc Furby escaped when Lewell fell asleep but he woke and moved towards two officers with the syringe as they entered to arrest him and they shot him with Tasers.

Lewell was jailed at Guernsey's Royal Court  for two years yesterday.

Crown Advocate Rory Calderwood said three officers rushed to a social services house in the island's St Sampson's area on October 24 last year after reports of someone 'smashing up the place'.

They found Lewell - whose face is covered with tattoos of insects and flowers - clutching a broken shard of bannister but PC Furby offered to go inside and talk to him because the pair had met before.

The court heard he swallowed pills and injected himself with medication before grabbing a pack of five knives.

He was also wielding a syringe, claiming he had Hepatitis C and anyone coming up the stairs could 'have it too'.

Weapon: This is one of five knives the thug had in his bedroom - he was arrested after her dropped off and officers Tasered him

PC Furby said in a witness statement: 'I went back into the hallway and I was now about a foot away from Lewell, who had the knives clutched in his left hand.

'He began puffing out his chest and began looking into my face with a scary intensity.

'He then said to me "You cannot leave, I'm not going to go calmly, they can come and get me".

'I felt a draining from my head to my toes and a deep-rooted feeling that everything was about to go wrong.'

Lewell, who suffered from mental health issues and had a string of former convictions, spent a week in hospital after the incident in an induced coma after vomit got into his lungs.

He denied ever intending to harm PC Furby but pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer and causing £465-worth of damage to social services-run property.
