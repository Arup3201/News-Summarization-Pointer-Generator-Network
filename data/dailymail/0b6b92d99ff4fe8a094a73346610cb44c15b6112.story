It is the highest military award for bravery awarded by a grateful nation, but despite storming a German machine gun post, Thomas Whitham was forced to pawn his hard-won Victoria Cross because his local council would not give him a job.

Private Whitham dodged bullets and shells while under heavy fire to capture the German machine gun at Pilckem, near Ypres in Belgium on July 31, 1917.

However, upon returning from frontline duties, Private Whitham, from Worsthorne near Burnley, found it difficult to find work, dying in poverty aged only 36.

Private Whitham died following an accident in 1924 while seeking work and was buried at Wheatley Lane Inghamite Burial Ground near Burnley. His family could not afford to buy a headstone to mark the hero's final resting place.

Yet, Burnley Council redeemed the medal, gold watch and a clock in 1931 and put them on display in Towneley Hall in the town.

A notice in the London Gazette of September 6, 1917 outlined Private Whitham's bravery and announced his award: 'For
most conspicuous bravery when, during an attack, an enemy machine-gun 
was seen to be enfilading the battalion on the right.

'Private Whitham, 
on his own initiative, immediately worked his way from shell-hole to 
shell-hole through our own barrage, rushed the machine-gun, and, 
although under a very heavy fire, captured it, together with an officer 
and two other ranks.

'The bold action on the part of Private Whitham was 
of great assistance to the battalion on the right, and undoubtedly saved
many lives and enabled the whole line to advance.'

Almost 30 years after his death, the Coldstream Guards Association erected a memorial marking Private Whitham's grave.

Burnley Council redeemed Private Whitham's medal and watch from the pawnbroker in 1931, seven years after his death.

However, Private Whitham's son William spent decades trying to convince Burnley Council to return the medal to the family so they could present it to the Coldstream Guards Museum.

The issue was raised in the House of Commons by Tory MP Nick Hawkins in March 1994.

Thomas Whitham's son William spent almost 40 years trying to get his father's Victoria Cross back from Burnley Council, even having the matter raised in Parliament

Mr Hawkins told the Commons:  'Private Whitham's son has for nerly 40 years been trying to get his late father's Victoria Cross medal displayed at the Coldstream Guards Museum, his late father's regiment, instead of where it currently is, in a museum in Burnley.'

Mr Hawkins said: 'This was supposed to be the land fit for heroes to live in.'

He said when Private Whitham sought manual work from Burnley Council he received a 'curt and humiliatingly dismissive' rejection letter - less than twelve months after returning from the front.

The Commons heard that Mr Whitham almost secured his father's medal for £50 in 1948 when a change of council leadership scuppered the deal.

Mr Hawkins added: 'Over many years 
since, all attempts to persuade Burnley Council to release the medal 
have failed, even though for many years it appears that the medal and 
its ribbon were not at all well looked after."

However,
in recent years officials in his home town decided that a sixth-form 
college in the town should be named after the war hero.

Speaking
at the time of the naming ceremony, headmaster of the Thomas Whitham 
Sixth Form College said: 'Thomas's story demonstrates that everyone from
whatever background has in them the potential to achieve something 
significant in their life and, therefore illustrates perfectly the ethos
of the Sixth Form, which is high achievement for people from whatever 
background.'

The Victoria Cross was introduced by Queen Victoria on January 29, 1856 to reward acts of valour during the Crimean War.

Since then, the VC has been awarded 1,356 times to 1,353 individuals.

Only 13 VCs have been awarded since World War Two.

The
original medals were cast from Russian bronze 
cannon captured during the battle of Sebastopol during the Crimean 
campaign.

However the remaining medals have been cast from cannon captured during the Second Anglo-Chinese War of 1860.

Tory Party supporter Lord Ashcroft owns more than 160 of the coveted medals.

There is a thriving trade in the medals which can be worth as much as £1.5m.

The most recent Victoria Cross was awarded to L/Cpl James Ashworth, who died in Afghanistan in June 2012
