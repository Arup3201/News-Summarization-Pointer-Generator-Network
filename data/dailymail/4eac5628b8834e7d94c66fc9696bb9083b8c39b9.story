A TV documentary uncovered some weird and wonderful animal lovers when they searched the world for the most pampered pet.

The show, which broadcast on Channel 5 on Monday, found people are spending thousands on their furry and feathered friends - whether that's by dressing them up in the finest clothes or taking them to a relaxing spa.

In Tokyo, Japan, people even workout with their pet pooches at dog yoga classes.

Yoga for dogs: Owners take their pets to a class in Tokyo

Weight lifting: In the tree pose, owners have to raise their dogs above their heads

At one with their dogs: The boat pose involves balancing your dog on your lap

Barking mad? The yoga instructor said the class is 'wonderful' for dogs

The participants perform yoga moves with their dog in tow and can even use them as weights.

The instructor explains of one move where the dog is lifted by their owner above their head: 'Lift your dog up slowly, imagine you are a tree and your dog is a fruit or flower.'

Meanwhile in the 'boat pose' the dog owner sits with their pet balanced on their lap while they lift their legs off the floor.

'You are the boat and the dog is your passenger,' the instructor explains. 'I know it's not easy to do but just be at one with your dog.'

When asked about the benefits of yoga for dogs, the instructor replied: 'It's wonderful, her (the dog's) expression is completely different after yoga.'

If you thought that was barking mad then wait until you read about Australia's Brian Harrington who was a contender for having the world's most pampered pets with his team of ducks.

Brian dresses his ducks up and takes them to family events to entertain people with a catwalk show.

The ducks have their own dress maker and their outfits include a bridal gown and 'day' and 'evening' wear.

Brain said: 'I love my ducks, I'm not ashamed to say they put a tear in my eye.

'We have some stunning outfits, they 
have an extensive wardrobe of 100 outfits. I want them to look like humans 
and their dresses to look like humans, it's the outfits that make my 
catwalk shows so special.'

Lizard lover: Henry lives with 20 reptiles

Posers: Henry has made a business out of photographing his pets

Meanwhile, over in the U.S., the Channel 5 documentary found business is booming at pet shops and grooming salons as people are spending thousands to ensure their dogs look their best.

For American reality TV star, Aubrey O'Day, this means giving her dogs, Ginger and Mary-Anne, regular pampering treatments and make-overs.

She takes them to a dog grooming spa where they are bathed, cleansed and then given pink and purple highlights.

She said: 'They are pampered with love and in turn they pamper me with love constantly. I just love sitting in the shower with them. I can't date a guy who doesn't love my dogs.'

Winner: The title of the world's most pampered pet went to Yorkshire terrier Lola, owned by Louise Harris from Essex

LA-based celebrity journalist, Sandro 
Monetti, explains that pets in Hollywood are the ultimate accessory 
because they give unconditional love and never deceive - or sue.

Also featured on the show are photographer Henry 'Lizardlover' who lives with 20 lizards and treats them like supermodels and Mexico's 'Luna the fashion kitty', a cat with her own fashion blog and online comic strip.

But the crown of the most pampered pet in the world went to Lola, a Yorkshire terrier who lives in Great Notley, Essex, with Louise Harris, 34.

Spoiled: Louise runs a pet boutique and gives her dog weekly beauty treatments

No expense spared: Lola has diamond collars, perfume and numerous outfits

Louise gave up a job in The City to run a pet boutique. Lola gets weekly spa sessions with her own beautician who gives her facials, coat conditioning, massage and reiki. The terrier also has clothes, accessories and dog beds that have cost Louise thousands.

She even once spent £20,000 to give Lola a pet wedding ceremony (they've since divorced).

Louise said of her pampered pooch: 'She is like my child but I understand she is never going to go to college or learn how to read and write, she is a dog.'
