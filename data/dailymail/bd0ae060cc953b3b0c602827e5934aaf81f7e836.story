France has been named the most visited country in the world, welcoming a record-breaking 84.7 million tourists last year.

The European hotspot was streets ahead of the second most visited country in the world - the US - beating it by almost 15million visitors.

While France, the US and Spain made the top three list of the most visited countries, the UK took eighth place, welcoming 31.2million visitors in 2013, a new record.

Eh Voila!  La Tour Eiffel: France welcomed 84.7 million tourists across its borders in 2013

A stony look: Paris observed from the top of Notre Dame with La Tour Eiffel in the distance

France - 84.7million

US - 69.8million

Spain - 60.7million

China - 55.7million

Italy - 47.7million

Turkey - 37.8million

Germany - 31.5million

UK - 31.2million

Russia - 28.4million

Thailand - 26.5million

But the UK is still losing out to European rivals, with Germany and Italy joining France and Spain ahead of Britain in the top 10 most visited countries in the world.

Some of the surprising entries into the top 10 incllude Turkey, which took sixth place, with 37.8million visitors and Russia, which made it into ninth place with 28.4million tourists.

Thailand rounded off the top 10 most visited countries in 2013.

The latest statistics come after a study was published by France's government competitiveness agency, confirming how many visitors the country received in 2013.

The statistics were referred to the World Tourism Organisation to be compared with statistics from each country. 

A record 32.8 million overseas visitors came to the UK, with French, German and American tourists accounting for one in three tourists.

The USA, France and Germany were also the biggest spenders in the UK, with their markets attributing to one quarter of the visitor spend pot - 'do visit again'. 

The French surpassed their 2012 figure of 83 million foreign visitors and easily outstripped The United States with 69.8 million and Spain with 60.7 million foreign visitors. 

The record 32.8 million overseas visitors who came to the UK in 2013 spent a record £21 billion.

The UK attracted 34.8m tourists in 2013, a record-breaking number, but not enough to beat European rivals

London calling: The capital accounts for 54 per cent of all UK inbound tourism

In 2012 the UK ranked eighth in the UNWTO international tourist arrivals league behind France, USA, China, Spain, Italy, Turkey and Germany. 

London accounts for 54 per cent of all inbound visitor spend, the rest of England 34 per cent, Scotland 8 per cent and Wales 2 per cent.

The UK may not be such a tourist honey pot as France, but we are only a small isle and quite content to keep calm and carry on unobserved.
