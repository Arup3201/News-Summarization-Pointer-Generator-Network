A culture of box-ticking means the public sector is less ethical than private business, according to a survey

A culture of box-ticking means the public sector is less ethical than private business, a study says, with organisations such as the NHS encouraging staff to hit targets at the expense of what is right.

Public sector bosses are far more likely to believe their employer is unethical than those working for limited companies, the survey of 2,500 managers by the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) found.

Only 7 per cent of plc bosses say their employer is ‘ethically poor’, compared with 13 per cent of public sector managers. Civil servants are also half as likely to say their employer has ‘excellent’ ethics – 20 per cent to 40 per cent.

Almost a third of managers rate their organisation as mediocre or worse on ethics, with bosses in big organisations four times more likely than those in small firms to rate their workplace as ethically poor.

Elisabeth Buggins, chairman of Birmingham Women’s NHS Foundation Trust, said in the report that strong hierarchies in the NHS mean staff are treated as children, so they are tempted to put obeying the rules ahead of patients’ needs. 

In an outspoken critique, she said: ‘If there are more rules, regulations and guidelines than anyone can remember, you stop people thinking for themselves.

‘People think that as long as they’ve ticked the boxes their bosses won’t criticise them. They focus on that and forget why they are actually there.

‘Even if what they are doing is not good for the patient, at least they can say that they’ve ticked that box and nobody can tell them off.’

She said demands on staff without increasing resources was ‘robbing staff of time to think’ and causing more anxiety, which made ‘objective ethical thinking more difficult’.

Mrs Buggins, former chairman of the NHS West Midlands Strategic Health Authority, who gave evidence at the public inquiry into the Mid-Staffordshire scandal, added: ‘What worries me is that in a business where emotional vulnerability is part of what you’re dealing with every day, they make people so afraid they can’t think.’

Managers in big organisations were four times more likely than those in small firms to rate behaviour in their workplace as ethically poor, according to the study.

The NHS is the UK’s biggest employer with more than one million staff.

Ann Francke, of the CMI, said: ‘The public sector is the bottom of the pile for bosses awarding their employer top marks for ethical behaviour.

‘This highlights a culture of obedience in organisations, with box-ticking and rule-following, which is more prevalent in public sector organisations.

‘There is a lot of pressure around cost-cutting and risk management to the extent that people no longer trust their own instincts over what is the right thing to do.

‘They feel unable to step up and be accountable for their own actions.’

In the NHS, she said, less ethical behaviour could be pretending to meet a target or spending less time with a patient in need in order to hit a target.

She said: ‘We have got to go back to basics and say “we are here to save lives and make people well” rather than “I have to make sure no one is in the emergency room for more than 10 hours or that the bed capacity rate stays above 97 per cent”.’

The CMI chief executive called for people to focus on the ‘more human impact of their decisions’.
