The militant Lebanese group Hezbollah said it would be 'more than happy' to act as a mediator in a bid to help resolve the conflict in Syria.

The invitation was made by Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, the group's leader during an interview with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange.

The interview, for Russia's RT cable TV channel, was Nasrallah's first in six years. In it, he said his group 'would be more than happy to mediate' in a bid to reach a political solution to end the bloodshed, the BBC reported.

Crisis: Hezbollah has backed the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad since the conflict started

Despite Hezbollah backing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad since the conflict started, Sheikh Nasrallah - who has led the Lebanese Shia Islamist group since the early 1990s - claimed the opposition were unwilling to negotiate.

According to the BBC he said in the interview: 'We contacted the opposition early on but they refused any dialogue with the regime.

'We'll be more than happy to mediate, but we are asking others to make their effort to create a political solution.'

The interview, which was recorded several weeks ago, was conducted by videolink from a secret UK location, because Assange remains in the UK fighting extradition to Sweden on sexual assault charges.

Meanwhile, the wives of the British and German ambassadors to the United Nations have produced a video urging the wife of Syrian President Bashar Assad to speak out and demand that her husband stop the violence in their country.

The video asks viewers to sign an online petition to Asma Assad asking that she take a risk and 'stand up for peace ... for the sake of your people'.

Plea: The open letter appeals directly to Bashar Assad's wife Asma

Huberta von Voss-Wittig, wife of Germany's U.N. Ambassador Peter Wittig, and Sheila Lyall Grant, wife of Britain's U.N. Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant, said in a letter accompanying the video that Asma Assad's 'public voice is needed'.

The video, released today, alternates pictures of the stylish British-born Asma Assad with scenes of Syria's conflict and its victims.

Bashar Assad's regime has been using force for more than a year to try to put down a public uprising.

The French foreign minister today said international sanctions targeting Syria's repressive regime had depleted its foreign currency reserves by half - and Damascus is actively trying to evade them.

Alain Juppe called for a solid international response to such Syrian 'manoeuvres' as he opened a Paris meeting of some 57 countries, including Arab League states, to reinforce sanctions against Syrian President Bashar Assad.

In an effort to ramp up the pressure in the face of a faltering cease-fire, Juppe plans to hold a meeting of core members of the Friends of Syria on Thursday, a French diplomatic source said.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the foreign ministers of Qatar and Turkey are among the invitees.

The aim is to send a 'firm message' to Assad's regime, which has only partially complied with the truce aimed at ending 13 months of violence, the source said on condition of anonymity because the details of the meeting were still being finalised.

The international community has tried a variety of ways to pressure Assad's regime into ending its crackdown, including financial sanctions, the subject of Tuesday's meeting.

The actual size of Syria's foreign currency reserves isn't known, but it was believed to be around $17 billion at the start of the uprising in March 2011. Juppe didn't specify how much of Syria's finances were impacted by sanctions, but said 'our information' is that they have been cut in half.
