Colonel Pete Brooks said Haley was being deployed as an individual and will be a liaison between an agricultural unit and Afghan leaders.

He is slated to return to the United States almost a year later in December.

In speeches, Governor Haley frequently talks about her husband's military service and says she is proud that he puts on his uniform daily when he goes to work.

In a statement to NBC, Michael Haley said: 'It is important to me to be able to give back. The only thing that gives me pause is the year-long deployment away from family.

'But in the end, I can't help but to think giving one year along with my fellow soldiers, as many have done before me, to secure a life of freedom for my family is well worth all that comes with it.'

National name: Mrs Haley, seen with presidential candidate Mitt Romney and New Hampshire senator Kelly Ayotte, has endorsed Mr Romney in the race

The couple have two children - Rena, 13, and 10-year-old Nalin.

Governor Haley is the first woman to run the state of South Carolina and the second Indian-American governor in the U.S.

She has been touted as a potential vice-presidential running mate for presumptive Republican candidate Mitt Romney.Â 

Although she endorsed Romney before her state's primary in January, she said at the time that she was not interested in becoming his running mate.
