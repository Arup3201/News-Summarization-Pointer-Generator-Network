Unrepentant: Retired civil servant Bill Worthington, 75, said he 'can't believe he has been taken to court' after he shot a squirrel which was stealing bird food from his back garden

After watching it raid his garden bird table once too often, Bill Worthington decided enough was enough.

The retired civil servant set a trap for his bushy-tailed foe and lay in wait.

It didn’t take long for the grey squirrel to take the bait and, with the animal cornered in the make-shift cage, the 75-year-old from Stockport, Greater Manchester, shot it twice with his air rifle.

He went shopping but, when he returned two hours later, the animal was still alive so he shot it a further three times.

Yesterday it emerged Worthington  is facing up to six months in jail or a £5,000 fine after being hauled before the courts for causing unnecessary suffering to the squirrel.

The keen crown green bowler and bird lover was reported to the RSPCA by a neighbour who spotted the animal, maimed, but still alive in his garden.

The five shots failed to kill the animal and it was later put down.

Worthington pleaded guilty but told the hearing he had been ‘provoked’ by the activities of the squirrels, which he described as ‘garden rats’ and ‘vermin’.

Speaking afterwards, he said: ‘I cannot believe I have been taken to court over this one grey squirrel, which, frankly, has been a pest and vermin. It does seem over the top.

‘I just wanted to keep my garden nice and feed the birds, yet these squirrels kept coming in and taking all the food.

‘They seem to wait in the trees until I’m not in the garden before striking. They dig up my garden and they eat the bird feed. In my mind they are a real problem.

‘I don’t want people to think I don’t like animals – far from it. I used to work on a farm years ago and I have a budgie called Peter who is marvellous, so clever.’

Caught: Bill Worthington set a trap for the squirrel after it kept stealing food from the bird table in his garden. RSPCA officers turned up at his house in Bredbury, Cheshire, after being tipped off by a neighbour

Claire Aldridge, prosecuting, told 
Stockport Magistrates’ Court that the RSPCA was alerted on September 27 
last year by a neighbour who had spotted the injured squirrel in the 
garden of Worthington’s home, in Bredbury.

She said: ‘The squirrel had been 
trapped in a cage in the defendant’s garden. Worthington took his .22 
air rifle and shot at it two times.

'The defendant went shopping at approximately 11am and left the squirrel in the trap.
    
'Later when he returned, it was still grabbing at the cage and biting it.

'So the defendant shot the squirrel a further three times at around 2:30pm. He left the squirrel in the trap and went out.’

Grey squirrels originate from North America but were introduced to the UK throughout the 19th and 20th centuries

The grey squirrel originated in North America but was introduced to the UK throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.

Larger and more robust than the native red squirrel, it has now spread across England, Wales and Scotland and is regarded as a pest.

The red squirrel used to be common but the population crashed because of greys spreading disease and taking their habitat.

Black squirrels, the same species as greys, are now also thought to be increasing in number.

Wild animals such as the grey squirrel are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

They can be caught and killed legally including live-catch cage traps, approved spring traps or a specific rodenticide poison that is only approved for use against grey squirrels by a local authority or professional operator.

However, such methods may not be legal in areas where red squirrels could also be at risk.

For example, it can be an offence to kill, injure or take a red squirrel, or to damage or obstruct its place of shelter.

If a live-catch trap is used, it must be checked several times a day and any captured grey squirrels humanely killed.

It is an offence if any unnecessary suffering is caused to captured animals.

In 2010 window cleaner Raymond Elliot became the first person in the country to prosecuted for causing harm to a non-domestic animal after he drowned a grey squirrel.

Magistrates gave Mr Elliot a six-month conditional discharge and ordered him to pay £1,547 to cover investigation and legal costs incurred by the RSPCA.

Countryside campaigners argue prosecuting people for killing pests is heavy-handed and expensive.

The RSPCA doesn't recommend that members of the public try to capture and/or kill grey squirrel but contact a reputable pest controller instead.

Worthington, who left to visit his 
sick wife in a care home, said he assumed the animal was dead, but when 
the RSPCA arrived at 4.20pm it was still alive.

‘The RSPCA recovered a live squirrel in the middle of the defendant’s garden,’ Miss Aldridge said.

‘This defendant shot a squirrel five 
times over five hours. He said he didn’t care about the suffering of the
 animal. The method of dispatch should be carried out humanely.

'What he did was unacceptably cruel and entirely unnecessary. He found it comical that the RSPCA were even investigating.’

Lee Strap, the vet who eventually put down the animal, confirmed it had multiple pellet wounds and was alive but unresponsive.

When questioned by RSPCA officers Worthington was described as ‘obtrusive’.

He confirmed he was a user of a .22 rifle and referred to the squirrels as ‘vermin’ and ‘garden rats’.

Worthington, defending himself, 
added: ‘We are talking about one squirrel here. The vet says the 
squirrel was “alive but not responsive”. That’s how I saw it. I tried my
 best to have away with it but I had other things to do.’

Magistrates granted Worthington unconditional bail. He will be sentenced next month.
