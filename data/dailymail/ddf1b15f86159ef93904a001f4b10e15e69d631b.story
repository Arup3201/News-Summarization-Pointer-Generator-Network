Australian babies struggle with their native lingo and find it easier to understand Canadians, a new university study shows.

Boffins from the University of Western Sydney (UWS) conducted research on 48 Australian babies of 15-months-old and were astonished to discover they can't distinguish certain vowels.

Yet when they heard the same words  in a Canadian accent they found them easier to understand.

Associate Professor Paola Escudero, who led the research with the university's Dr Karen Mulak, says: 'Young infants are more likely to understand words spoken in their native languages.

'We wanted to find out what accent they would be most comfortable when learning the words.

'But surprisingly our study found the normal home-ground advantage doesn't always apply for babies exposed to Australian English.'

Researchers from the University of Western Sydney split 48 babies into two groups to teach them words

Australian English is easily recognised by its distinctive vowel sounds and rising inflection so to test the tots researchers divided them into two groups.

One half of the group listened to Australian English and the other 24 Canadian English.  

'We tried to see whether children had more difficulties if they heard words spoken in one accent as opposed to another accent in English,' adds Professor Escudero.

The babies in each group were shown an object, and heard the name for the object repeated over and over, spoken by a speaker of Australian English or Canadian English

The babies in each group were shown an object, and heard the name for that object repeated over and over, spoken by a speaker of Australian English or Canadian English.  

They were also taught a made-up word, 'deet' and showed picture associations for easy recognition.

Shortly afterwards they were then tested again to see if they noticed when the sound  changed to 'dit' and 'doot' and the babies listening to the Australian speaker didn't notice the vowel changes.

But the infants listening to the Canadian English speaker picked up the change in the word.

Researcher Dr Mulak, from the Univerity's MARCS Institute, says that by the age of 15 months babies' brains understand sounds, and picking up new words and the new vowels can be confusing.

'Some Australian English vowels, such as the ones in "sheep," "ship" and "shoot" are very close to one another,' adds  Professor Escudero.

'As opposed to the same Canadian English vowels which are more distinct. We now know these Australian English vowel differences are not easy to learn.' 

Mothers instinctively emphasize the different vowels when they talk to their babies and Professor Escudero says the research can help with teaching the language to immigrants.

Surprisingly the babies understood the Canadian accent better than the same words said in Australian

'The Australian accent may make it a little harder for Australian infants to master some vowels,' she says, 'but it doesn't make a difference in the long run.

'For adult migrants to Australia who are just starting to pick up the language, they may take a bit longer to master Australian English.'

The researchers are now going to re-create the study with Canadian babies to see which accent they understand better, and they're also going to test older infants.
