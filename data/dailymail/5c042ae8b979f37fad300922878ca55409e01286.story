A colourful photo of an olive tree surrounded by tulips has beaten thousands of entries from around the world to win the Royal Horticultural Society's annual photographic competition.

Josie Elias, from Sherborne, Dorset, received £1,000 for her winning picture after she stumbled on an Iris garden at Plantas Distintas in Marnes, Spain.

With a record number of entries this year, other top photos were of a leaping mouse, a striking shot of the skeleton of a tree in a snowy landscape, and close-ups of insects on plants.

Ms Elias said: ‘I was particularly intrigued by the contrast of the gnarled old olive tree and colourful spring flowers. I felt I had to capture the scene and was very encouraged by the nursery owners to enter the photograph into the RHS competition.

‘I am very excited and honoured to have won.’

Judge Chris Young, editor of The Garden magazine, said: ‘Josie's image of the olive tree, underplanted by tulips and set within a picturesque view, is not only a beautifully composed photograph; it also screams warm weather and springtime vibrancy.

‘She has captured so well the spirit of a garden that can be seen at that time of year.’

Competition organiser James Arnold, said: ‘We have had a record number of entries this year, doubling figures from last year.

‘The judges have been astounded by the extraordinary quality of the images which people have produced from all over the world; it's simply breathtaking and very difficult to choose a winner.’
