A journalism professor who boasts online about his love of free speech has been placed on administrative leave by the University of Kansas over controversial remarks he posted on Twitter calling for the murder of the children of members of the National Rifle Association.

The tweets were in response to Monday's deadly Naval Yard shooting, in which 12 people were killed.

In the post, Associate Professor David Guth blames the fatal attack on the NRA, and goes on to say that next time there's a mass-shooting that he hopes the victims are the children of NRA members.

He ends his 140-charecter rant with 'shame on you. May God damn you.' 

Suspended indefinitely: Advocated for the murder of the children of NRA members. He has since been suspended

On Thursday, the university issued a statement condemning Guth's offensive tweet.

'The contents of Professor Guth’s tweet were repugnant and in no way 
represent the views or opinions of the University of Kansas,' the statement reads. '[I]t is 
truly disgraceful that these views were expressed in such a callous and 
uncaring way. We expect all members of the university community to 
engage in civil discourse and not make inflammatory and offensive 
comment.'

On Friday, KU Chancellor Bernadette Gray-Little announced Guth's suspension.

Vile: Guth was disciplined previously by the university over 'unprofessional, threatening, and abusive behavior towards another faculty'

'In order to prevent disruptions to the learning environment for 
students, the School of Journalism and the university, I have directed 
Provost Jeffrey Vitter to place Associate Professor Guth on indefinite 
administrative leave pending a review of the entire situation,' Gray-Little said in the statement.

The chancellor added that his classes will be taught by other professors.

Guth did not immediately reply to MailOnline's request for comment, but turned to Twitter on Monday to defend his tweet from dozens of people outraged over fact that he would wish death upon children.

On Tuesday, an NRA member - and father of five children - asked Guth to invite him to one of the professor's classes for an unspecified debate. Guth declined, claiming that the a debate with an NRA member 'isn't relevant to the course subject.'

The UK chancellor says the university does not condone Guth's comments and calls them 'disgraceful'

On Wednesday, Guth confirmed to the website CampusReform.com that he was responsible for the tweet and that he has no regrets.

'Hell no, hell no, I do not regret that Tweet,' he said. 'I don't take it back one bit.'

The website also reports that Guth was censured by the university in October, 2010 for 'unprofessional, threatening, and abusive behavior towards another faculty.'
