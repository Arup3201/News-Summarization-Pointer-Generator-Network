It’s fair to say that it’s not exactly car-horns and fireworks on the streets of Barcelona at the news that the club are signing Thomas Vermaelen.

‘Not as good as Mats Hummels’ (who they were never likely to get anyway) and not as young as Marquinhos (ultimately far too expensive) summed up the immediate reaction.

This was tempered by the fact that the former Ajax man is a year younger and probably a better option than Liverpool’s Daniel Agger. But the worst thing about the signing is that he joins from Arsenal.

Another Gunner: Barcelona have completed the £15million signing of Thomas Vermaelen from Arsenal

Failure: For a combined £32million, Emmanuel Petit and Marc Overmars flopped following their 2000 arrival

Happier times: Petit and Overmars were a key part of Arsenal's double winning campaign in 1997/98

Never mind an intelligent assessment of how he might fit in, history says Barca shouldn’t be going within 10 buyout clauses of the Gunners after a string of big money acquisitions in recent years.

They did wonders for Arsenal’s accounts and nothing for Barcelona’s trophy-winning chances.

In 2000 Arsene Wenger sold Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit to the Catalans for a combined £32m.

Overmars stayed for four trophyless, injury-plagued years. Petit was gone in one season sold back to Chelsea for £7m.

Gio Van Bronckhorst arrived too and fared far better but he is a blip on the chart.

In 2006 Barcelona wanted Thierry Henry but Wenger made sure they waited a full season and still paid £16m when they signed him a year later.

Henry at least fared better on the pitch than Overmars and Petit but he still took a year to get going and Arsenal had clearly already long since had the best from him.

Top of the flops: Barcelona put a £70million release clause on Alex Hleb, but the midfielder would later struggle to break into Birmingham's first team while on loan back in the Premier League

Not needed: Alex Song was bought to play in midfield or defence but has hardly featured at the Nou Camp

Cesc Fabregas was perhaps Wenger’s greatest victory. He signed him for £500,000 and eight years later sold him back to Barcelona for £35m.

Fabregas failed to fit back into the club he had left aged 16 and never saw out the five-year contract he signed. At least on this occasion a large part of that original outlay is understood to have been recouped by his ‘undisclosed fee’ signing for Chelsea.

And at least Fabregas and Henry thrilled the Nou Camp scoring goals and winning trophies. The worst – or best, from Arsenal’s perspective – of business between the two clubs comes by way of Alex Hleb and Alex Song.

Captain fantastic: Thierry Henry and Cesc Fabregas were both captains and star players for Arsenal

Best times have gone: Henry won the Champions League at Barca, but Arsenal got the best out of the striker

Misfit: Fabregas was courted by Barca for long periods but failed to settle once arriving at the Nou Camp

Hleb signed a four-year deal in 2008 and Barca somewhat optimistically put a £70m buy-out clause on him. They ended up terminating his contract six months before it was due to expire after he failed to fit in, or persuade any of the clubs he went on loan to – Stuttgart, Birmingham City and Wolfsburg – that they should pay to sign him.

The club are currently trying to find a new home for Song. After paying £15m for him in 2012 and giddily announcing that he could also play at centre back he has been largely peripheral – not really needed in holding midfield where Barca already have Sergio Busquets and not able to play at the back, despite the billing given in his presentation.

So now it’s over to Vermaelen. He rejoins former Ajax team-mate Luis Suarez and with his club history should certainly need no period of adaptation. His recent injury record is a concern but if he can overcome that he might be able to turn the tide of disappointing arrivals from Arsenal. He is a least a ‘proper’ central defender, not something Barca have signed for five years.
