A homeowner has taken one of the Big Six energy giants to court and won after they repeatedly harassed and threatened him for money he didn't owe.

In a David and Goliath style legal battle, people's champion Barry Payling, 62, represented himself against Npower in his second case against an energy firm in four years.

He won £3,000 in total in compensation for the trouble they caused him.

The 62-year-old's problem with Npower started when tenants living in his late mother’s house, which he rents out, moved out in July 2013 leaving an outstanding bill of £450.

People's champion: Barry Payling, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, who was at the receiving end of a number of mistakes by energy firm Npower. He sued them and took them to the county court and won

Mr Payling, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, then began receiving letters from Npower demanding the outstanding money be paid, despite the fact the debt wasn’t his.

He began receiving disconnection notices followed by demands from debt collectors. By this point Mr Payling had spent hours of time on the phone arguing his case and asked Npower to compensate him by £80 for the hassle.

When the energy giant failed to meet his request Mr Payling summonsed them for approximately £450.

Npower failed to turn up to represent themselves in court and Mr Payling won the case. It was Mr Payling's second court battle against a Big Six energy firm in the last four years

Npower failed to pay so in May Mr Payling instructed the sheriffs to redeem the compensation awarded to him through the courts

Mr Payling eventually recovered the compensation he was owe after The Sheriff's Office intervened

No one turned up at Northampton County 
Court at the hearing in January 2014 to represent Npower so the case was
 granted in Mr Payling’s favour and the firm duly paid him the £450 he 
had requested in compensation.

He said: 'It
 all went quiet and then I popped around to my mother’s house, which was
 still empty, and there was a letter from the bailiff’s demanding around
 £450 owed to Npower and it said I was due to attend court on that same 
day.

'I
 had a big job on that day and had to cancel it to go to court. When I 
arrived at Rotherham County Court I was informed the case had been 
written off the previous day and the Npower had failed to inform me.

'I had lost earnings and was furious with the hassle and stress Npower were putting me through so I summonsed them for £2,500.'

Once again Npower failed to turn up to represent themselves in court and Mr Payling won the case.

This time Npower failed to pay so in May he instructed the sheriffs to redeem the compensation awarded to him through the courts.

The enforcement officers turned up at Npower’s head offices in Wiltshire demanding the money or threatened to take equipment amounting to that sum and after further stalling the red-faced company finally coughed up.

Mr Payling, who took on British Gas under similar circumstances four years ago and won £2,000 in a landmark case against them for time wasting, said: 'What is disgraceful is that they are quite happy not to turn up to these hearings and pay the compensation because they know that money will just come by increasing bills for other customers.

'They are bullies and there is nothing a bully hates more than being bullied back. I feel like, in this I have given them a bloody nose and more people should be doing the same by standing up to them.

'I studied law very briefly and was in low level local government many years ago so I have a slight grasp enough to stand up for myself in court but not much more than your average person.

Following Barry Payling's court battle with British Gas in 2010, consumer experts told customers that they should keep detailed records of telephone calls made and letters sent to broadband, gas or electricity companies.

If the customer is forced to spend serious amounts of time sorting out problems caused by the companies, they should attempt to bill them for loss of earnings.

Mr Payling was paid more than £2,000 by British Gas after he threatened the company with court action following two years of disputes.

Mr Payling was about to take the energy company to the County Court following claims they miscalculated his bills, sent debt collectors to his home for money he didn't owe and sent his mother a letter asking her to sign up with them – after she had died.

He logged every phone call he made and every letter he sent to British Gas during working hours, then billed them for his loss of earnings, to demand the £2,108 sum at court.

'Npower have sent me bills for the same periods for different amounts, demanding money I didn’t owe, threatening me and harassing me.

'They are one of the most complained about companies in the country. MPs are weak about putting any sort of pressure on them to raise their standards.

'It takes people like me standing up to them because they shouldn’t get away with treating people, their customers, like this.

'Energy companies rely on people giving in but it is worth the aggravation because now, thanks to Npower and British Gas, the compensation I have received will cover my energy bills for the next few years.'

A spokesman for Npower, who according to Which? Have an average of 83 complaints per 1,000 customers, said the case was not defended to avoid causing any further inconvenience.

They added the company paid the money but were not aware that Mr Payling had not received it before an enforcement officer arrived.

The spokesman said: 'It was thought the matter had been resolved to Mr Payling’s satisfaction, until without any notice, an enforcement officer attended our head office.

'If he had notified us that he had not received the payment it would have not been necessary for him to instruct the enforcement officer.'

Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other.

Shrewd
consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - moving 
deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest 
deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts.

Suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so.

If
you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. 
stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big 
chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year.

Prices
are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you 
will depend where you live.

You only need to be interested in the tariff
that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison 
to find the best price.
