A Mercedes grand prix race car driven to victory by racing legend Juan Manuel Fangio sold at auction today for a world record £19.6million.

The Mercedes-Benz W196 won the German and Swiss grands prix during the 1954 season where the Argentinian driver claimed the second of his five world titles.

Despite being one of the 'most significant motor cars of the 20th century', the unrestored Formula 1 car was left in a warehouse for decades before today's auction at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.

The unrestored Formula 1 car is 'a piece of mechanical jewellery' according to one motoring historian

Collectors from three continents vied to be the highest bidder for the vehicle, which had been expected to fetch £10million by experts who said 'there were no parallels' in the market.

The untouched condition of the Mercedes only added to its value, with its 'patina' - character - appealing to collectors.

The final sale total reached £19.6million after the hammer went down at £17.5million.

It smashed the previous £10.8million record set by a 1957 Ferrari Testa Rossa prototype in 2011.

The German-made car, chassis number 00006/54, sold to a private buyer over the telephone, auctioneers Bonhams said.

Fangio, who died in 1995 aged 84, won the world championship five times and is regarded as one of the greatest drivers in the history of motorsport.

The car contains many features which were
innovative in the 1950s, including a fuel-injected engine, a 
lightweight chassis weighing only 72lb and all-round inboard-mounted 
brakes.

The Mercedes W196 had independent suspension and a straight-eight engine which helped minimise its overall height.

At the Swiss GP Fangio raced ahead to beat his nearest rival - Ferrari's Jose Froilan Gonzalez - by 58.7 seconds.

The 'patina' - character - of the car only made it more attractive to potential buyers

Nicknamed El Maestro, Fangio once 
said: 'When I was in a racing car, I always liked to see exactly where 
the wheels were pointing.

'I asked for a version with no 
bodywork covering the wheels for the Nurburgring race, and in no time 
Mercedes had built one - and I drove it to win the German Grand Prix.'

Motoring historian Doug Nye said Fangio would shake his head and smile a 'slow smile' if he were alive to see today's auction.

'He was a humble man, originally a mechanic from a potato town in Argentina, and he never forgot his roots,' said Mr Nye.

'As a driver, he was simply a genius. As a man he had no enemies. He was
universally loved, even by those he regularly beat on track. No 
standard-setting sportsman could have a better epitaph.

After the 1954 season, Fangio's Mercedes W196 appeared at the following year's Italian grand prix but suffered gearbox failure.

It was re-prepared to full race standard later that year and consigned to the Daimler-Benz Museum in Germany.

In June 1965 it was exhibited in Munich and during 1966 it was shown at Le Mans in France and Hockenheim in Germany.

It then appeared at the 1967 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, before being run in a tyre test at the Unterturkheim factory test-track and displayed in Berlin.

In November 1967 it was exhibited at Stuttgart University.

The car made further appearances in Luxembourg, Berlin and Hamburg in 1969 and was eventually presented to the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu, Hampshire, in the 1970s.

It was sold to a private collector in the 1980s and then into the ownership of a German businessman.

'Mercedes has long been recognised for the world-class quality of its 
products and in 1954/55 they set out to rebuild their reputation for 
automotive excellence post-war.'

Mr Nye said the car was a 'window into the past'.

He said: 'In every area of the car, 
there is evidence of just the most fantastic workmanship. It was 
designed by very sophisticated, hi-tech engineers.

'But more than that it was made by 
ordinary working men who did a brilliant job.

'It's hand crafted and it's
just like a piece of mechanical jewellery.'

Bonhams chairman Robert Brooks said: 'I have handled some of the world's most desirable and important motor cars during a motoring auction career spanning five decades, but I have reached a peak today with this legendary grand prix car.

'It was a personal privilege to preside over the sale of this vehicle, which is not only one of the most significant motor cars of the 20th century, but also the most important historic Grand Prix racing car ever offered for sale.'

The auction house said the Mercedes is one of the most significant cars of the 20th century and the most important historic Grand Prix racing car offered at public auction.

Potential buyers from three continents had shown interest in the vehicle, which was sold with noticeable blemishes.

James Knight, group motoring director
at Bonhams, said: 'We had eight telephone bidders at the start of the 
bidding and we had three people in the audience, so we had more than ten
people who were prepared to spend.

'Of those 11 bidders, only five got the chance to bid.

'We always knew that it was a very, very important car.'
