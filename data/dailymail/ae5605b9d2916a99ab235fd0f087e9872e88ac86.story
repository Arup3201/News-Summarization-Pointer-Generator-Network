Police are to be investigated over claims that a man who died after being shot with a Taser was mistaken for a wanted criminal with the same name.

Jordan Begley, 23, who had a suspected heart defect, was hit with a charge from the 50,000-volt stun gun after officers were called to deal with a row at his home last month.

Yesterday it emerged that the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is looking into claims of a tragic mix-up.

The watchdog said mistaken identity 
was one line of inquiry, but said Mr Begley’s family had not made the 
claim to investigators.

‘We
will look at all relevant information, including call handling and 
radio transmissions between officers responding to Mr Begley’s address 
to see if any mistake occurred, and if it did, if that mistake had any 
inappropriate influence on any officer’s decisions to use force,’ said 
an IPCC spokesman.

Police also insist there is no evidence to support the claim and say they were initially told that Mr Begley had a knife.

Officers
were called to the ice cream factory worker’s home in Gorton, 
Manchester, by his mother Dot on July 10 to deal with a row between him 
and a neighbour.

after officers from Greater Manchester Police arrived, Mr Begley was 
shot using a Taser and died less than two hours later.

Grief and anger: Dot Begley wants answers about the day her son died

Mrs
Begley, a 46-year-old café worker, said yesterday that officers had 
repeatedly asked if she was from Sale – the nearby home town of a 
25-year-old wanted burglar who had the same name as her son and who had 
breached the terms of his prison licence.

‘It didn’t make sense at the time but then when I found out about the other Jordan Begley it clicked,’ she said.

She
claimed her son was unarmed and ‘calm and compliant’ before he was 
shot, which left him ‘battered and bruised’ and with ‘his eyes 
flickering’.

‘The 
response was so heavy-handed – Jordan was nine stone and they’d been 
called out to deal with a domestic argument,’ she added.

‘He
was calm and compliant, he wasn’t armed and they could have cuffed him 
if they wanted to. I can’t believe they’ve followed protocol and there’s
no way that Taser should ever have been used.’

Mr Begley is the tenth person to die after being shot with a Taser since they were introduced in 2004.

Six
weeks before the incident he had collapsed from an irregular heartbeat 
and was undergoing tests to diagnose a suspected heart condition when he
died.

A Home Office 
post-mortem examination has so far failed to establish Mr Begley’s cause
of death, but independent tests carried out on behalf of the family 
found he had marks that suggest he had been handcuffed. The family have 
also launched a civil claim against police over his death.

Assistant
Chief Constable Dawn Copley confirmed the mistaken identity claims but 
said she was ‘not aware’ of any evidence to support it.

‘We will of course continue to work with the IPCC to assist their investigation,’ she added.

The other Jordan Begley was eventually rearrested by police a week after the Taser incident and returned to prison.

Beard Street in Manchester, where the incident took place

Mrs Begley was stunned when armed officers arrived at her house and stormed inside the small terraced property.She says she was forced to wait outside her home as around 10 officers spoke to her son inside.

For the first time she has spoken publicly about the night she says left her life ‘in ruins’.

She said: 'Not long after he got back from work there was an argument with a neighbour but it was something or nothing. Jordan had been threatened and he wanted to go back outside and sort it out but I locked the door and phoned the police.

'Two officers arrived at first and everything was very calm, they were on the doorstep chatting but then loads of vans turned up with armed officers and they forced him inside. He was calm and compliant and doing everything they told him and for that reason I thought everything was going to be okay.

'I was outside looking in through the front door and I could see they had a Taser pointed at him, he had his arms by his side and was still following instructions.

'One of the officers kept saying "step back, step back" but he was against the dining room table and couldn’t step back any further. At that point one of the officers closed the front door on me.'

The first time Mrs Begley realised Jordan had been Tasered was when an ambulance arrived at the house and he was carried out on a stretcher.

She described her son as ‘battered and bruised’ and with ‘his eyes flickering’.
