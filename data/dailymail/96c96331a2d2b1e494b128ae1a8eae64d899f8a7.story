On Christmas Day 1974, police officer Daryl Manzie emerged from what was left of his Darwin house and thought: 'We must be the only ones left alive.'

The city's 45,000 inhabitants had spent a harrowing night lashed by winds so fierce they broke the recording equipment at the Bureau of Meteorology. 

At least 66 people were killed in the storm.

Manzie likened the noise of the wind to a speeding train bearing down on his home.

'It hit the house like a bloody giant sledgehammer and the house is heaving and moving, and the manhole cover disappears, and I get the torch and shine it up and the next minute the roof disappears,' he says.

Although Darwin did have a history of being periodically destroyed - by cyclones in the late 1800s and 1937, and suffering extensive damage caused by Japanese bombs in 1942 - the relentless fury of Cyclone Tracy would change the city forever. 

It levelled and altered its essential character.

As Manzie puts it: 'Those that went through it were different people to those that didn't.'

Darwin before Tracy was still a frontier town of opportunity and promise.

'It's always been a place to come if you're running away from something or looking for your next big chance,' Lord Mayor Katrina Fong Lim tells AAP.

Jill McKerchar Kinang, who finished high school in 1974, remembers her childhood as an outdoor idyll, hours spent playing along beaches and in the bush in a small town where everyone knew everyone else.

'It was a dream, it was absolutely wonderful,' she says. 'But that freedom and sense of knowing everyone disappeared after the evacuation.'

Before Tracy, there weren't many sophisticated buildings in Darwin.

But once it was decided in 1975 that the city would be rebuilt - which wasn't initially a certainty - things progressed rapidly.

Designs intended for homes in southern cities such as Perth or Melbourne were appropriated for Darwin so houses could quickly be constructed for the returning population.

Darwin inhabitants say houses and building were built in identical-looking blocks in the ravaged northern suburbs

Fong Lim says this resulted in identical-looking blocks in the ravaged northern suburbs.

The Royal Darwin Hospital's design was intended for Canberra, and continues to be an example of some of the 'really stupid' planning decisions, she says.

The newly introduced cyclone construction code didn't preclude good design, 'but where there was a need to build fast and just get them up, then you do get things that are a bit square-blocky', Fong Lim said.

Recently, planners considering the city's master plan felt that modern Darwin is ugly, she says.

'The city was reborn in the 1980s and that's what you've got, ugly architecture; it's a symptom of the time.'

Author Sophie Cunningham, in her book Warning: The Story of Cyclone Tracy, quoted resident Vicki Harris: 'It was like a forgotten backwater, really, back in the early seventies.

But in 1980 it was almost as if the cyclone had done it a favour by blowing it off the map ... it had really blown the cobwebs out of the place.'

Manzie, who spent 18 years in the NT Parliament from 1983 and has seen four decades of change, says Tracy revitalised the city.

'You see what Darwin is today,' he says. 'I don't think it would have grown nearly as quickly.

'It was an exciting time; it brought new people into the city, new opportunities, new businesses.'

It was a time of optimism. As southern Australia struggled with high unemployment, Darwin boomed, with the Top End slowly shaking off the grip of heavy-handed southern leadership that dominated the first few months after Tracy,
