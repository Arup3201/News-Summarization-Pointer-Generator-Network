Brendan Rodgers has insisted labeling Steven Gerrard a 'legend' does not do the club captain justice after the midfielder decided to end his 26-year association with Liverpool.

The 34-year-old joined Liverpool when he was eight and will leave when the current Barclays Premier League season ends after opting not to renew his contract at Anfield.

Rodgers has worked with the former England captain since becoming manager in 2012, and emphasised summing up Gerrard's contribution at Liverpool is an 'impossible task'.

'It is almost an impossible task to find the words to appropriately sum up Steven Gerrard and his importance to Liverpool,' Rodgers told the club's official website. 

'This is an era where the word "legend" is vastly overused, but in his case it actually doesn't do him justice.

'From a personal point of view I will always have gratitude for the support he gave me, when I arrived here as manager.

'Steven came to see me and promised he would be 100 per cent behind me and do everything he could to help as we looked to introduce new ideas and a new way of working. He wasn't just true to his word, he vastly exceeded it.'

Gerrard turned down the offer of a contract extension in November and became free to talk with overseas clubs on January 1.

Jordan Henderson is expected to fill the captain's void in his absence, though Rodgers admits Gerrard will be difficult to replace.

'As a player he is immense and the influence he has on games should never be understated,' the Liverpool manager continued.

'At times he has carried this club on his back and in my time here he has always shown the ability that has rightly seen him be regarded as one of the world's best for well over a decade. 

'As a leader and as a man, he is probably incomparable to anyone I have ever worked with.

'He takes professionalism to a new level and the dedication he has to his work is an example to everyone in the game.

'He is also someone who has always put the club and team ahead of himself and I think that will ultimately be his legacy.

'People better placed than me to judge have said Steven is Liverpool's greatest ever player. 

'When you look at the company he is in, that is some statement.

'We of course will miss him, both on the field of play and in his capacity as club captain, but his influence will live on and we wish him nothing but joy and success wherever he chooses to go next.

'Until that moment arrives I will continue to enjoy working with Steven Gerrard the man and Steven Gerrard the player, one of the greatest we have seen.'
