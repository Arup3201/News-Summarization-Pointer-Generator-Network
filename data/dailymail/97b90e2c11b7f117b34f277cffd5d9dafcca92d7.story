Loss: James Embry, 57, passed away in prison following a hunger strike - but his family was not told

Relatives of a man who died of a hunger strike in prison and was buried in a pauper's grave have revealed the devastating moment they learned of his death in the newspaper.

James Kenneth Embry, who had been in and out of prison after struggling with alcohol and drug abuse and mental health issues, died after a five-week hunger strike at the Kentucky State Penitentiary in Eddyville in January.

After his death, prison officials said no family had visited him in prison or claimed his remains and he had been buried in a pauper's grave.

It wasn't until his step-daughter Hope Keown - who described Embry as a fantastic father before he vanished from their lives - read an article while sat in her kitchen that she learned of his death.

'We didn't even know he was back in prison,' Keown, 35, told the Associated Press.

She
 and her mother, 58-year-old Mae Embry of Owensboro, Kentucky, didn't 
believe what they were reading at first, then broke into tears as the 
reality set in. They struggled to tell other relatives.

'Kenny
 was very strong willed so it breaks my heart that he resorted to 
starving himself,' Keown said. 'I think he wanted to live the good life 
and be a family man. He just didn't know how to shake his demons.'

Embry's hunger strike had included a nine-day stretch in which he 
lost 32 pounds from his six-foot frame, dropping down to just 138 
pounds. He eventually died from dehydration and starvation.

It came after Embry was hit with a nine-year term for multiple drug crimes in 2010 and given multiple disciplinary infractions. Then a 
fight with another inmate in 2013 had led him to request a cell in solitary 
confinement because he feared for his safety.

In May 2013, Embry requested to stop taking anti-anxiety medications. In December, he was denied a request to resume them.

Four
 days later, he began refusing meals. He did not make clear why he began
 the hunger strike, but he expressed suicidal thoughts and told a prison
 psychologist: 'I have nothing left to live for.'

His death prompted
 an internal investigation by corrections officials and a separate 
investigation by state police. A doctor was fired and others were investigated.

Heartbroken: Hope Keown said her stepfather was 'the best ever' before they drifted apart

The
 case exposed lapses in medical treatment and the handling of hunger 
strikes, and the local prosecutor is considering whether a grand jury 
should hear the case.

Keown said that her stepfather had not always been so troubled. She recalled the good times, such as when a sober Embry helped with homework and folded laundry.

He had drifted in and out of jails since 1978, serving short sentences for drug offenses and assault, but between stints behind bars, Embry had two sons and a daughter, married Mae Keown Embry and moved in with her and her two daughters.

Embry entered Hope Keown's life when she was nine years old.

'When my stepdad was on his medication, he was the best ever!' said Keown.

When he was sober, Embry was a hard-working man who was big on family dinners, helping with homework and teaching his stepchildren life skills, from changing a tire and saving money to washing dishes and folding laundry, Keown and her mother said.

Embry purchased the crib and changing table for Keown's first child when she was 19.

'That was probably one of the last moments I really shared with him,' she said.

But after a while, Embry 'grew bored and started partying with a certain group of friends that mom made clear was just a bad group of friends,' mainly people he had met in jail, she said.

That's when he brought out 'Spider Red', the nickname he gave to the side of his personality fueled by alcohol and drugs - and the nickname he felt compelled to get tattooed on his right arm.

Family members said Embry had battled for years with mental illness and addiction. As much as all of that drove them apart, it also fuels their anger at how his life ended in a tragic death while in the state's care.

'This man needed treatment,' Mae Embry said. 'Just because he's mentally ill, you don't throw him out with the dishwater.'

He didn't like taking anti-anxiety and anti-depression medications and would start using drugs and alcohol, then land in jail. Things got worse when his father, Herman Embry, died in 2001 while James Embry was in jail. Officials wouldn't grant him furlough to attend the funeral.

'I think that changed him,' Keown said. 'I think he started to lose hope.'

The marriage ended more than a decade ago, and Embry's family lost touch with him long before he began his final prison sentence. No dramatic moment led to the split, the family said. Instead, after the divorce, different lifestyles simply pushed him out of his loved ones' orbit.

Mae Embry and Keown are now dealing with regrets and hope to make some amends by trying to move his remains to a family plot.

'Just because you're divorced doesn't mean we stopped caring about him,' Mae Embry said. 'It's just, sometimes when someone is like that, you need to move on with your life.'
