Gareth Bale looked fresh enough to go out and do it all again. This is how it must feel to be high on the euphoria of an unstoppable rise to the top of the world.

It had just gone midnight in the concrete underbelly of the Stadium of Light and his eyes sparkled as Bale tried to explain the emotion of scoring the goal Real Madrid have waited 12 years to score.

‘When you’re a little boy you dream of lifting the Champions League trophy and to lift the 10th one for Real Madrid is special,’ said Bale, pausing en route to the carefully choreographed celebrations waiting in the Spanish capital.

‘It’s hard to describe what it felt like. Seeing all the fans and all the players run over, it was amazing. It’s the reason I joined Real Madrid to play in competitions like this and be able to win them. For me it’s a dream come true.’

The £86m man became the first Welshman to score in the European Cup final and the 20th Briton.

For
 the record, the other 19 are: Tommy Gemmell, Stevie Chalmers, Bobby 
Charlton (2), Brian Kidd, George Best, Terry McDermott, Tommy Smith, 
Phil Neal (2), Kenny Dalglish, Trevor Francis, John  Robertson, Alan 
Kennedy, Peter Withe, Teddy Sheringham, Steve McManaman, Steven Gerrard,
 Sol Campbell, Frank Lampard and Wayne Rooney.

So many expensive footballers have pulled on the pristine white shirt without being able to achieve what Bale, the most expensive of them all, has done in his first season in Spain.

David Beckham, Kaka, Robinho, Fabio Cannavaro, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Mesut Ozil and Michael Owen have all come and gone, unable to deliver what Bale delivered.

With his status assured as a goal hero of La Decima in a final against city rivals Atletico Madrid, his life will never be the same. No-one will quibble with the £86million world-record transfer fee again.

Not for the first time in the last 12 months, he must wonder where this breakneck journey is going to take him. From Footballer of the Year to the Bernabeu Stadium, the winner in the Copa del Rey final and now the pivotal strike in the Champions League final.

What better way to celebrate all this than with a showpiece at the Cardiff City Stadium where Real Madrid will face Sevilla in the UEFA Super Cup on August 12, a week before Tottenham set out on yet another Europa League campaign.

It promises to be an emotional homecoming for the Welshman, who could captain his country for the first time in a friendly against Holland in Amsterdam next week.

Parents Frank and Debbie were numb with a heady mix of shock and pride as they climbed aboard an early-morning flight in Lisbon Sunday. They had spoken to their son on the phone but did not have time to see him.

Bale was being whisked through his media responsibilities before flying back to Madrid with his team-mates. By 4am yesterday morning, he was sharing photos of the victory party with his three  million followers on Twitter.

On his way out of the stadium, he seemed bashful, reluctant to talk too much about the most amazing night of his professional life.

Many team-mates left wearing their white Real match shirts or specially printed ‘La Decima’ T-shirts. Bale was slick in his black club suit and skinny tie, toilet bag tucked under an arm and the silver gong dangling from his neck on a blue ribbon.

He had the medal, he had his hands on the trophy every footballer wants and he had made such a vital contribution, once Sergio Ramos had saved Real from heartbreak with the stoppage-time header that took the game into extra time.

Without Ramos, this would have been a tale of woe for Bale; emptiness after a promising first campaign in Spain, cast as a villain, having snatched at two glorious chances, one in each half of normal time, and missed them both. He had not played well.

‘A few thoughts crept into my mind,’ said Bale. ‘We have been like that all season. We’ve been down in the last minute and always been able to come up with a crucial goal and we showed it again. We kept believing in the football we play and we came out on top.’

The concept of extra time might have been designed for Bale and Angel di Maria to showcase their phenomenal reserves of stamina and pace against wilting opponents.

Ups and downs: Bale missed a number of good chances before eventually getting on the scoresheet

Atletico were grinding to a standstill with players barely able to run, hobbling and limping. Dotted around the pitch were red-and-white shirted shapes stretching muscles as calves and hamstrings cramped.

Then came Bale’s moment; an hour and 50 minutes into a gripping final. It typified his boundless energy and desire as he followed in Di Maria’s run and shot as it spun high from the left boot of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois.

Despite those earlier misses, he refused to hide. ‘You have to keep persisting,’ said Bale, but few would have noticed had he been jogging up the pitch rather than sprinting from half-way in anticipation. This was the hard part, to be where he was at that stage of the game.

‘He turned up when he was needed,’ said manager Carlo Ancelotti, who boldly predicts the Wales international, without a World Cup summer, will be an even greater force next season.

Persistent: Bale refused to hide despite those earlier misses

The finish was relatively simple: a big spring and a cushion header from a yard or so. ‘Don’t miss,’ smiled Bale, when asked later what had flashed through his mind at that precise moment. He did not.

This was far removed from Bale’s exhilarating solo goal to win the Copa del Rey against Barcelona last month and yet so much more precious to a club obsessed with this 10th European title.

It destroyed Atletico to such an extent that they collapsed and conceded two more, scored by Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo. It was to all intents and purposes the killer strike — the winner — although everyone in the Real camp seemed mightily relieved when Ronaldo engineered and then converted a penalty and spared them all the inevitable sulk.

Room to improve: Carlo Ancelotti said the Welshman can be even better next season

‘He obviously got on the score-sheet and that was important for us,’ said Bale, diplomatically. After all, the stage had been set for Ronaldo’s night in Lisbon. His penalty was his 17th goal in Champions League campaign, a record.

His personal numbers are staggering but not even the self-important shirtless and muscle-flexing celebration of the fourth goal could distract from the fact this triumph was about more than one man.

The perfect 10th was also about Iker Casillas and Ramos and Di Maria and Marcelo. It was about Ancelotti and it was about Bale. Nine months after leaving Tottenham he could not have dared to hope for more.
