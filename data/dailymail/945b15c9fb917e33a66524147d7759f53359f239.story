An animal charity has slammed a cruel owner who dumped a puppy in a hedge on a freezing night with a note around its neck which read: 'Please look after me as my owner doesn't want me'.

The 14-month-old spaniel-pointer cross was locked in a cage and left in a bush by the roadside near Downham Market, Norfolk.

Luckily, a passer-by found the abandoned pet before he starved or froze to death, after hearing his yelps for help from the undergrowth.

Dumped: Snoopi, a 14-week-old spaniel-pointer, was discovered in a hedgerow next to a road with a sign around his neck, begging: 'Please look after me'

Attached around his neck was the note, 
written in a childish scrawl, which continued: 'I'll try to do my 
best to keep you happy. My name is Snoopi.'

His previous owners had left a selection of brand-new equipment needed to look after
 a new pup, including a bed, dog food, dog training paraphernalia and a
 teddy bear.

The unwanted animal is now being looked after by the RSPCA which blasted his former owners.

The charity's inspectors believe the dog was an unwanted Christmas present which was dumped when the novelty wore off.

Unwanted: A note left beside the unloved dog found in Downham Market, Norfolk, and written in a childish scrawl, read: 'My owner doesn't want me anymore. I'll try to do my best to keep you happy'

RSPCA inspector Jon Knight said: 'I have no doubt in my mind that this was an unwanted Christmas present.

'It is a perfect example of why we urge people to think very carefully before buying pets as presents.

'Every year animals are abandoned when the novelty of having a dog or cat wears off.

'Pets are a lifelong commitment and 
anyone taking one on needs to be very sure there is a long-term 
commitment to properly care for the animal - and that he or she will be 
loved for life.'

Insp Knight said it was strange that a brand new rehoming pack had been left with Snoopi.

'I can't quite get my head around how someone could dump this really incredibly cute dog in this way.

'On
 the one hand, they seemed to care due to the note and the careful way 
all the dog-related goodies had also been left,' he said.

'On the other, it's just so callous.

Cruel: An RSPCA inspector thinks Snoopi was an unwanted Christmas gift because he was dumped along with new equipment, pictured - including a bed, dog food, dog training paraphernalia and a teddy bear

'He was left hidden by a residential street where he could easily have been ignored or missed and on a very cold night.

'Temperatures being what they were he would have been really ill if left there overnight.

'Lucky for him I think he must have been spotted quite quickly as his toys were still really clean and had obviously not been rained on.'

Friendly Snoopi was taken into RSPCA care after being thoroughly checked over and found to be in good health.

He will have his initial inoculations before being put up for rehoming after being found on Monday.

Anyone with any information about how and why poor Snoopi was so heartlessly dumped should call the RSPCA on 0300 1234 999.
