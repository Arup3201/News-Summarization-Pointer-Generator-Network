Rise: Royal Mail is now worth £5.6billion, £2.3billion more than its initial value

Taxpayers had a raw deal from the sale of Royal Mail because it was priced too cheaply, the National Audit Office will say today.

The Government’s spending watchdog said the controversial privatisation was ‘marked by deep caution, the price of which was borne by the taxpayer’.

In October, the Royal Mail was floated on the stock market at a price of £3.3billion. Today it is worth £5.6billion – a gap of £2.3billion.

On the first day of trading, about £750million ‘flowed to the new shareholders’ – mainly City investors who benefited from an instant 38 per cent share price rise.

The NAO concludes: ‘The Department for Business could have achieved better value for the taxpayer.’

Last night Margaret Hodge MP, chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, accused the Department for Business of having ‘had no clue what it was doing’.

Describing the sale as a ‘second-class performance’, she said: ‘It is clear to me the Department for Business under-sold the taxpayer when it privatised Royal Mail.’

But Business Minister Michael Fallon dismissed the criticism, saying: ‘Hindsight is a wonderful thing.’

He
 added: ‘We were cautious to avoid the risk of this transaction falling 
over. If we had put it on the market at a much higher price, we would 
have been left with a fatally damaged Royal Mail.’

Today’s NAO report says the Government met its ‘primary objective’ of selling the postal giant before the election in May 2015.

But it also lays bare the extent to 
which the City hit the jackpot from the sale – and damningly concludes 
the Government should cut its reliance on City advisers before any 
future flotations.

When the 
shares went on the market, private investors were allowed to buy a 
maximum of £750 worth, but an exclusive group of 16 of the City’s 
biggest names were given ‘priority’ status and allowed to buy up to 
£46million worth each.

When the Royal Mail floated 
last year, Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was looking for 
long-term stability from ‘the right kind of investor community’.

As
 a result, 16 of the City’s investment giants were singled out from the 
796 which wanted to buy shares and given favoured status.

This
 group was awarded a much larger tranche of shares – about £46million 
worth each – while 506 received nothing and the rest between £600,000 
and £6million worth.

But
 few of the ‘priority’ investors – believed to include Legal & 
General, Threadneedle, BlackRock, and Fidelity – have been as long-term 
in their approach as Mr Cable had hoped.

The NAO said: ‘Almost half of the shares allocated to them had been sold within weeks.’

In one example, Standard Life bought nearly 12million shares in October, but now owns just 118,480.

Speaking to MPs in October, Business Secretary Vince Cable justified the arrangement by saying he wanted to attract ‘the right kind of investor community’, which was about ‘long-termism’.

But today’s report reveals many of the ‘priority’ investors then rushed to sell their shares, making themselves a fortune as the share price rocketed from £3.30 to more than £6.

Of the 16, six had sold 100 per cent of their shares ‘within the first few weeks of trading’, according to the NAO.

Yesterday Mr Cable insisted: ‘Achieving the highest price possible at any cost and whatever the risk was never the aim of the sale.

‘The report concludes there was a real risk of a failed sale attached to pushing the price too high.’

Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said the Department for Business had been ‘very keen’ to sell Royal Mail in order to prevent the company becoming a burden on the taxpayer.

But he added: ‘Its approach, however, was marked by deep caution, the price of which was borne by the taxpayer.’

In order to sell the business, the NAO said Royal Mail’s £8.6billion pension black hole had also been given to the taxpayer. While it has received £28.8billion of assets from the pension fund, it has also been left with £37.4billion of liabilities, which are the pension promises made to Royal Mail’s workers.

Last year, it emerged that UBS, one of the banks which ran the sale on behalf of the Government, had considered increasing the price at which the shares would be offered from £3.30 to £3.50 just days before the flotation.

But it then decided the move was too risky, and warned  Mr Cable against increasing the share price – advice which he followed.

William Rucker, chief executive of Lazard, the investment bank which advised the Government on the sale, insisted it was the ‘maximum price achievable’ at the time.

Mr Rucker said: ‘There was no clear ability to go above £3.30 at that particular time.’

Last night, Royal Mail shares were worth £5.63 each.
