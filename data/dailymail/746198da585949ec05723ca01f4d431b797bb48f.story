A surgeon infected with Ebola in Sierre Leone will be flown to the University of Nebraska
Medical Center for treatment this weekend, it has been revealed. 

Dr Martin Salia, 44, was born in the West African nation, but is a permanent resident of the U.S, according to an official in the federal government with direct knowledge of the case.

This which would make him the first non-U.S. citizen to be flown back to the states for treatment, said the individual, who was not authorized to release the information and spoke anonymously.

Ebola-stricken: Dr Martin Salia (pictured), 44, will be flown to the University of Nebraska Medical Center for treatment this weekend, according to an official in the federal government with direct knowledge of the case

Dr Sali, a general surgeon who had reportedly been working at Kissy United Methodist Hospital in the Sierra Leone capital of Freetown, is believed to be married to a U.S. citizen with two sons.

He came down with symptoms of Ebola on November 6 but test results were negative for the virus, according to the official. He was tested again on Monday, with positive results. 

The medic, who lives with his family in Maryland, is currently in stable condition at an Ebola treatment center in Freetown. It is not clear whether he was involved in the care of Ebola patients

Upon his transfer on Saturday, he will be the third Ebola patient at the Omaha hospital and the 10th person to be treated in the U.S. for the virus, which has so far killed more than 5,000 people.

The center has successfully treated two other Ebola patients who contracted the virus in Liberia, one of the three West African countries worst hit by the largest outbreak in history, Omaha World-Herald reported.

Dr Rick Sacra, who was delivering babies in Liberia, and NBC freelance cameraman Ashoka Mukpo were treated and have since been released from the hospital, which has the largest of just four biocontainment units in the country.

There are currently no patients in the U.S. being treated for Ebola, after Doctors Without Borders worker Dr Craig Spencer was cured of the virus and released from Bellevue Hospital in New York on Tuesday. 

In a statement on Thursday, the Nebraska Medical Center said it had no official confirmation that it would be treating another patient.

Sons: The medic, who has at least two sons, including Hinwaii (left) and Maada (right),  came down with symptoms of Ebola on November 6. Tests results on Monday were positive, according to the official

However, it said that an Ebola victim in Sierra Leone would be evaluated for possible transport to the hospital. The patient would arrive Saturday afternoon, it said. 

Meanwhile, the State Department said in a statement that along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it had been in touch with the Maryland wife of an unidentified Ebola patient about transferring him to the Nebraska Medical Center for care.

Dr Salia will be the sixth person flown out of West Africa and back to the United States for treatment.

The first were Dr Kent Brantly and Nancy Writebol who were treated at Emory University. Another person, who has never been identified, was treated at Emory as well, while Sacra and Mukpo were flown to Nebraska.

Yesterday, Dr Sanjay Gupta said on CNN that Dr Salia was clearly in a stable enough condition to travel in.

'Just the simple act of transporting somebody from West Africa to the United States, the person's got to be medically stable enough as well,' Gupta said. 'So the fact that they're going to do that transport, that probably gives some idea of how he's doing overall in terms of stability.'

The surgeon's transportation to the U.S. brings up questions as to what the Obama administration's policy is on paying for non-U.S. citizens' chartered flights back to America for treatment.

Last month, Fox News obtained a State Department memo, developing plans to let non-American citizens into the country for Ebola treatment, but the agency initially said the allegations were false.

There are currently no Ebola patients being treated in the U.S. after Dr Craig Spencer (left) was released from Bellevue Hospital on Tuesday, Ebola free.

The 'sensitive but unclassified' memo advocates for a plan to let non-Americans into the country 'as long as they are otherwise eligible for medical evacuation from the Ebola affected countries and for entry into the United States'.

The document goes on to say there's an 'obligation' to help non-citizen employees of U.S. agencies and U.S.-based private firms and that the U.S. should 'show leadership and act as we are asking others to act by admitting certain non-citizens into the country for medical treatment for Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) during the Ebola crisis.'

The memo was met with backlash by some in Congress who believe the policy would leave the U.S. sensitive to further outbreaks. Already, two nurses have contracted the disease after treating a patient in the U.S. (nurses Nina Pham and Amber Vinson were subsequently cured. Their patient Thomas Eric Duncan, unfortunately died).  

Dr Kent Brantly  (left) and nurse Nancy Writebol (right) were the first aid workers to be evacuated from West Africa for Ebola treatment in the U.S. this year 

'This is simply a matter of common sense that if you are concerned about this problem spreading … we certainly shouldn't be bringing in the patients,' House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said.

The State Department, however, has denied the allegations that they are trying to bring non-U.S. citizens to the country and say they are only exploring the option of letting other countries use their specially-equipped planes.

'There are absolutely no plans to MEDEVAC non-Americans who become ill from West Africa to the United States,' an officials told Fox News.

The surgeon is currently in Sierra Leone, one of the three hardest hit countries in the largest outbreak in history. Above, a health care worker from Sierra Leon's Red Cross Society Burial Team is sprayed with disinfectant after removing a corpse from a house in Freetown on November 12

'We have discussed allowing other countries to use our MEDEVAC capabilities to evacuate their own citizens to their home countries or third-countries, subject to reimbursement and availability. But we are not contemplating bringing them back to the U.S. for treatment.

'Allegations to the contrary are completely false'
