Football players at Minnesota State, Mankato, refused to practice for their former head coach on Wednesday, greeting his reinstatement by an arbitrator after child porn allegations by demanding that the interim coach keep the top job.

Todd Hoffner returned to campus for the first time since the arbitrator ruled he was fired unfairly last year in the wake of a child porn investigation that ultimately cleared him.

Hoffner was arrested in 2012 over 
images of his children on a university-issued cellphone.

Though he was 
eventually cleared by a judge who described the images as innocent 
pictures of children acting playful after a bath, the school 
subsequently suspended, reassigned and fired him for reasons that 
weren't made public at the time.

Mavericks players came out for spring practice Wednesday afternoon but were not in uniform, The Free Press of Mankato reported.

They read a statement saying they were unanimous in wanting Aaron Keen to remain as head coach.

'We've all become outstanding community members, students and athletes in the last year and a half since the removal of Todd Hoffner,' said the statement, which junior safety Sam Thompson read aloud. 'Throughout this process, we have been silent. It is time our voice is heard.'

Thompson said the players 'want answers, because this is our team,' according to the MSU Reporter, a student publication.

'As a unit we have decided not to practice, because of the change-up in the coaching situation,' he said.

Keen gave a brief statement saying the football program was bound by the arbitrator's ruling and that Hoffner is the head coach.

Athletic director Kevin Buisman said in a statement that players had 'shared their concerns.'

He said a meeting was scheduled for Thursday between the players, Hoffner, Keen and the rest of the coaching staff.

Under interim coach Keen, Minnesota State finished 11-1 and advanced to the second round of the NCAA Division II tournament. But they were also successful under Hoffner: 34-13 in his four seasons from 2008-12.

Hoffner will return to his old job after an arbitrator ruled he was wrongfully terminated, saying the decision wasn't easy but that it would help him and his family heal

The arbitrator's report said Hoffner 
was accused of viewing porn on his work computer and letting his wife 
use the device, and neither charge was proven.

Hoffner,
 47, accepted the head coaching job at Minot State University in 
January, and the arbitrator's order that he be reinstated forced him to 
choose.

He said Tuesday he would go back to Mankato, saying it would 'help heal that injury.'

His
 supporters said the school overreacted in the wake of the sex abuse 
scandal at Penn State, noting his high-profile arrest came just months 
after retired Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky was 
convicted of child sex abuse.

The university said in a statement Tuesday that it welcomed Hoffner back and also apologized to him.

Earlier
 Wednesday, Hoffner told the Free Press it felt refreshing to be back on
 campus.

He said he got a big hug from senior tight end Darius Claire as
 he walked into the football offices before practice.

'That made me feel good. I don't know if every person will feel that way,' said Hoffner, sporting his Minnesota State jacket.
