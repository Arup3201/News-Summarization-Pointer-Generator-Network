She's an Indigenous icon and one of the country's most successful athletes, but Nova Peris has been no stranger to controversy during her two decades in the spotlight.

On Thursday morning, the Labor senator was the subject of allegations by The Northern Territory News that she sought taxpayer money to solicit a sexual liaison with sprint star Ato Boldon in 2010.

Peris 'categorically' rejected the allegations and Boldon said the newspaper's article included 'gross fabrications'.

Peris has bruised many egos during her time as a star athlete and politician. Daily Mail Australia recalls some of the most dramatic moments of Peris' tumultuous career.

Tensions on the track

Fresh from becoming the first Indigenous athlete to win Olympic Gold as part of the Hockeyroos in 1996, Peris' decision to try her hand at athletics caused a stir.

She had a tense relationship with sprinter Melinda Gainsford-Taylor, particularly following an incident at the 1998 Commonwealth Games.

Peris came under fire when Gainsford-Taylor collapsed near the finish line of the 200m final because Peris did not rush to help her after she won the race.

Peris later said she had been unaware of what happened to her fellow competitor until several minutes after the event.

In an interview with the ABC, Peris said she believed some of the criticism was spurred on by racism.

'Mel is blonde and beautiful and a media favourite, while I am an Aboriginal from the Top End,' she said. 

'It's never quite stated, but I did sense some racist undertones in some of those (critical media) articles.'

Tensions between the two athletes reportedly continued through the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.

A tumultuous personal life

Ms Peris' personal life has often been turbulent. 

In 2001 she divorced her first husband, Sean Kneebone, who was her manager and the father of her daughter, Jessica. 

In 2002, she would marry Australian sprint star Daniel Batman. The couple had two children, Destiny and Jack, but divorced in 2010 following lengthy proceedings.

Batman, 31, was tragically killed in 2012 when his car rolled over south-east of Darwin. 

She reportedly met her third husband, Scott Appleton, while he was  working at an Indigenous boys mentoring program. 

The couple married in 2013.

Ugly Labor warfare

In a political gamechanger, in early 2013 Prime Minister Julia Gillard (left) announced Nova Peris as her 'Captain's Pick' for the Labor senate seat in the Northern Territory. She replaced Senator Trish Crossin (right)

Peris' most recent career move also put noses out of joint.

In one of the most surprising political developments of 2013, Prime Minister Julia Gillard nominated Peris to become Labor's next senator for the Northern Territory.

She would become the nation's first Indigenous female to be elected to Parliament - but not without a messy preselection battle with the woman she replaced.

Incumbent senator Trish Crossin, who had held the seat for fifteen years, was upset by Ms Gillard's decision, which the prime minister dubbed her 'Captain's Pick'.

In her memoir, My Story, the former prime minister recalled the outgoing senator becoming emotional when she told her about her decision.

Crossin blasted Ms Gillard's decision in her valedictory speech to the Senate.

A fiery Crossin said: 'Do we need more women in parliament? Of course we do, but not at the expense of each other.’

'Do we need Indigenous representation? Most certainly we do, but not in a vacuum without or plan or strategy.'

Crossin also took a veiled swipe at the prime minister. 

'Just because one person says it must be so does not make it democratic.'

A row at the school sport's track

Senator Peris' every move has come under scrutiny as an elected official. 

She was last month accused of 'abusing' a volunteer school sport official by a Northern Territory newspaper. 

Peris was accused of scolding school track and field officials, saying she was an Olympic athletes and knows how 'how athletic events work'

Quoting unnamed sources, The Northern Territory News alleged Ms Peris became upset when she failed to register her son on time for a track event.

The newspaper said Peris scolded officials, telling them she was an Olympic athlete and knew 'how athletic events work'.

Peris apologised for the alleged row in a statement.

'I'm both shocked and surprised to hear that my comments may have caused offence,' the newspaper quoted her saying.

'However, if any offence was caused, I apologise.'
