Reunion: Jaycee Dugard's father Ken Slayton pictured in 2010. He has given an exclusive interview in the latest edition of the National Enquirer and revealed that his daughter has not contacted him or responded to his messages in the five years since her freedom

Five years after her dramatic rescue, Jaycee Dugard has still not contacted her biological father, leaving him heartbroken.

According to the National Enquirer, Kenneth Slayton, 68, is yet to set eyes on his daughter or his two granddaughters born to Jaycee during her 18 years of captivity at the hands of Phillip Garrido in Antioch, California.

Kenneth has begged his estranged daughter to contact him, almost five years to the day she arrived at a parole office in Concord with her two children and Phillip and his wife Nancy.

'I've made myself known to her, so if she elected to see me, she knows where I'm at,' said Kenneth to the National Enquirer.

On June 10, 1991, Jaycee, 11, was abducted on her way to catch the school bus in South Lake Tahoe, California.

Kenneth told the National Enquirer that he was not made aware of her kidnapping until FBI agents arrived at his home to tell him.

A nationwide search was launched for Jaycee, which went unresolved till her sensational return 18-years later.

Throughout the intervening years Jaycee was a prisoner in a disgusting makeshift tent on Garrido's property and gave birth to two daughters by him after he repeatedly drugged and raped her.

Vulnerable: Jaycee Dugard, now 34, has not contacted her biological father according to a new National Enquirer interview

Jaycee was rescued in 2009, when two female police officers became suspicious of Garrido, a convicted rapist, and summoned the family - including Jaycee's two daughters - to a parole meeting.

Garrido was sentenced to 431 years to life for the kidnap and rape of Miss Dugard. His wife Nancy was sentenced to 36 years to life.

Following this, Kenneth claims he tried to contact Jaycee but was ignored at every attempt.

'They cited some back child support,' said Kenneth to the National Enquirer.

'At that point it was like turning the switch off. I said enough is enough.'

Failed by the system: Jaycee Dugard was 11 when she was kidnapped by a convicted rapist who was out on bail in California

Staggering: Tarps, tents and a wooden structure are seen in the backyard of alleged kidnapper Phillip Garrido August 28, 2009 in Antioch, California. Jaycee Lee Dugard was allegedly kidnapped by Phillip Garrido nearly two decades ago and was forced to live in tents and sheds behind Garrido's home with two of her children that were fathered by Garrido

Now 34, Jaycee lives with her 16 and 20-year-old daughters away from the public eye in California and appeared to accept a heroism award from Oprah Winfrey in March 2013.

'It would be very nice to have a big family reunion,' said Kenneth's wife, Jamie.

'Jaycee has three sisters and a brother and we would like to open our arms to her.'

Over the past five years, Jaycee has given interviews recalling the horror she faced as Garrido's prisoner.

In an emotional 2011 interview, Jaycee fought off tears as she described the overwhelming feeling of hope after giving birth to a baby girl in her kidnappers squalid back yard.

At only 14, little Jaycee had already been a prisoner of predatory pedophile Garrido for three years by the time she gave birth in August 1994.

Speaking to ABC's Diane Sawyer, Jaycee described the traumatic, but ultimately uplifting effect the birth of her first child had on her frightened 14-year-old self.

Locked up: Phillip Garrido and his wife Nancy are serving 431 years and 
36 years respectively for abducting Jaycee and hiding her in the 
backyard of their home. Jaycee had two children by Phillip Garrido

Held: Garrido, a registered sex offender, kept Jaycee Dugard at his Antioch home, pictured, for 18 years

Describing the birth as 'painful', Jaycee said: 'But then I saw her,she was beautiful.

'I felt like I wasn't alone any more. I had somebody who was mine.

'I wasn't alone.'

Jaycee continued: 'And I knew I could never let anything happen to her.

'I didn't know how I was going to do that, but I did.'

Mrs Sawyer, clearly struggling to form her next question, told Jaycee: 'I am trying to imagine what it is like.'

Jaycee, confidently answered: 'I don't know, I can't imagine being beaten to death, and you can't imagine being kidnapped and raped.

'You just do what you have to do to survive.'

When she was finally found in August 2009, Miss Dugard couldn't bring herself to tell police her own name, because she hadn't said it in 18 years.

Ever since she was discovered in 2009, Miss Dugard has fiercely guarded her privacy.

During the broadcast, Miss Dugard describes how Garrido abducted her, shooting her with a stun gun and pulling her into his car before driving her to his home in Antioch, California.

She tells Ms Sawyer how she can remember her hand closing on her sticky pine cone as she was dragged away.

Her captivity finally came to an end on August 25, 2009, when Garrido, a convicted sex offender, was ordered to bring his daughters to a parole meeting.
