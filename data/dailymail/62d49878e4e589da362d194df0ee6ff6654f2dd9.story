Two powerful earthquakes shook central New 
Zealand this morning, damaging homes and roads and sending office workers 
scrambling for cover in the capital Wellington.

A magnitude-6.5 quake struck just 
after 2:30 p.m. near the small South Island town of Seddon, and at least
six aftershocks were 5.0 magnitude or stronger.

No serious injuries were reported although the power was cut and hundreds of people were lefr stranded.

Destruction: Earthquake damage to a property in the small South Island town of Seddon after a magnitude-6.5 earthquake hit in the upper South Island of New Zealand

Powerful: The strong earthquake shook central New Zealand, damaging homes, destroying a bridge and sending office workers scrambling for cover in the capital

Damage It sent panicked Wellington workers and residents into the streets, but caused little major damage just weeks after a similar size quake shook the harbourside city

Collapse: Workmen clear rubble from a road after the side of a hill collapsed

Several homes near the epicentre were severely damaged, with chimneys collapsing and roofs caving in, said police spokeswoman Barbara Dunn.

She said a bridge was severely damaged on the main highway near Seddon, and that rocks and debris had fallen onto the road. Police closed a section of the highway.

Some buildings in Wellington, the capital, were evacuated, and items were knocked off shelves in places.

Police said a number of people were 
freed from Wellington elevators that stopped working. The initial 
temblor also forced the nation's stock exchange to close for more than 
an hour.

Wellington 
Mayor Celia Wade-Brown said there was no major damage to the city's 
infrastructure or office buildings. She said highways had become clogged
as people left the city.

'We think this is business as usual,' she said, 'but it is going to take a little while for people to get home tonight.'

Difficult: Commuters wait for alternative transport after all train services were cancelled following a magnitude 6.2 earthquake

Delays: Thousands of workers walk home from the central business district of Wellington as the trains stop working

Community: Residents gather at a welfare base set up at Seddon school

Desertion: Motorists face gridlock on Wellington roads as people flee the city

Safety: A worker marks an existing crack in the Wellington waterfront which increased in size

Damage: The roof of a church. A quake of similar strength in the same area three weeks ago broke water mains, smashed windows and downed power lines

The
U.S. Geological Survey said the epicentre of the initial temblor was 94
kilometers (58 miles) west of Wellington at a depth of 10 kilometers (6
miles).

A quake of similar strength in the same area three weeks ago broke water mains, smashed windows and downed power lines.

Caroline
Little, a seismologist with New Zealand quake monitoring agency GeoNet,
said the series of quakes since July had followed an unusual pattern.

'Normally you get a big quake and then the aftershocks get smaller in magnitude,' she said.

Little said the July quake was on a fault line near Seddon that had not previously been mapped.

She said it was too early to determine if today's quakes were on that same fault.

A different fault line runs through Wellington, and many in the city fear an earthquake along that fault could result in a major disaster.

New Zealand is part of the so-called Pacific 'Ring of Fire' that has regular seismic activity.

A severe earthquake in the city of Christchurch in 2011 killed 185 people and destroyed much of the city's downtown.

Local authorities issued no tsunami warnings after today's quakes.
