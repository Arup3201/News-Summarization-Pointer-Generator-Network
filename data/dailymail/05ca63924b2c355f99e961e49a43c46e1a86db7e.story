19 Kids and Counting stars Josh and Anna Duggar have revealed that they are expecting their fourth child together. 

The couple, who were married in September 2008, announced the news on Anna's Twitter page yesterday evening, with the expectant mother telling her 62,000 followers: 'We are so excited to announce...we're pregnant! #4andCounting #BlessingfromTheLord @joshduggar #19Kids'

Josh, 26, is the eldest of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar's 19-strong brood and was the first of the children to start a family.

In a video released by TLC, both he and Anna expressed their elation at the happy news - and revealed that they waited until after Josh's sister Jessa's wedding to husband Ben Seewald last month to tell the family about the pregnancy. 

'This time of the year, there's so many things we're thankful for,' Josh says in the video, while sitting alongside his pregnant wife and three children. 'From my sisters getting proposed to and married, to all the fans who are watching at home.'

Anna then let slip the couple's exciting announcement, saying: 'One of the things we're really thankful for this season, is that we're expecting.'

She added that, although she is struggling with morning sickness, she couldn't be happier about her fourth pregnancy.

'Good things are happening': Anna, 26, who married Josh in September 2008 (pictured), admitted that she is struggling with morning sickness but insisted she didn't mind as it means her pregnancy is progressing

'm having a lot of morning sickness so it is difficult, but it's good because I know good things are happening,' she said. 

'After Ben and Jessa's wedding, we were still visiting with the family in Arkansas, and that was really exciting to get to share with the family the exciting news.'

The couple already have three young children, a five-year-old daughter, Mackynzie Renée, and two sons, Michael James, 3, and Marcus Anthony, 1.

Their fourth child is due just a few months after Josh's younger sister Jill is expecting her first baby with husband Derick Dillard.

Lucky number three? It has also been rumored that Jessa Duggar, 23, is expecting her first child with husband Ben Seewald. The couple married on November 1

Jill, 23, announced her pregnancy back in August and last month revealed that the couple are expecting a baby boy, who is due in March. 

'I was really excited,' Derick, 25, told People. 'As a new dad, to have a firstborn son to be our first child and be the leader of his siblings, it is very special.'

The two Duggar siblings may not be the only ones expecting new arrivals next year; last month, just three weeks after her wedding to Ben Seewald, it was reported that 22-year-old Duggar daughter Jessa may already be pregnant. 

'They look at sex as a "present" from God and they couldn’t wait to "open it" on their wedding day,' a source told InTouch Weekly. 'I wouldn’t be surprised if Jessa were pregnant already.'
