As the famous caped crusader, Batman is known for hunting down the infamous criminals of Gotham City and saving many lives in the process.

But for one would-be superhero, he has managed to land himself in hot water for behaviour which is out-of-character for Bruce Wayne.

Christopher Schwartz, known as 'Bar Harbor Batman,' has made appearances at parties and summer parades in the Maine area dressed as Batman.

In trouble: Christopher Schwartz, known as 'Bar Harbor Batman,' posted on Facebook that he would blow up a hospital unless he was paid $1 million. The April Fool's joke resulted in him being arrested on a terrorizing charge

But on April Fool's Day, he posted on Facebook that he would blow up a hospital unless he was paid $1 million.

According to WABI, the post read: 'I demand payment of 1 million Dollars or I will Blow up the Hospital. Once the funds are secured, Private Message me for Further Instruction.'

However, not everybody shared the wanna-be Batman's sense of humour and unfavourable responses to his post soon began to appear.

Within just one hour, police officers were knocking at his door and arrested him on a terrorizing charge.

Sorry: After realising that his post had caused offence, Christopher Schwartz issued this apology on his page

Speaking to WABI, Mr Schwartz, who 
lives two blocks from Mount Desert Island Hospital in Bar Harbor, said: 
'What surprised me the most is how quickly everything happened. I didn't
even think of it after I posted it.

'I'm like, "I've got to post something today, it's April Fools"'.

Despite
insisting it was a joke, some reports have said that when police 
officers arrived at Mr Schwartz's house, he asked them if they had 
brought the money.

The unfortunate episode has now resulted in Mr Schwartz adding 'this is a joke' to certain comments he leaves on his Facebook page.

He has been released on bail and will face his charge in court in June.
