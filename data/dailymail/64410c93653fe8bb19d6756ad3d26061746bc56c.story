Katie Hopkins has sparked an online backlash for calling Angelina Jolie 'smug' after she revealed she underwent preventative surgery for cancer.

The controversial columnist posted a message on Twitter when the Hollywood star, who is married to Brad Pitt, revealed she had surgery to remove her ovaries and Fallopian tubes due to a second health scare.

As thousands of people took to Twitter in support of the 39-year-old mother-of-six, Ms Hopkins wrote on the social media site: 'Angelina Jolie. Smug doesn't even come close. Curating her organs to maximise life expectancy. What's next fag ash lil? Your lungs?'

She then posted a picture of the A-lister holding a cigarette and tweeted: ‘This is my point.

'Fill your boots with preaching, but don’t then fill your lungs with tar.’

However, Twitter users were quick to respond, with many posting abusive messages to Celebrity Big Brother star Ms Hopkins.

Julian Nicholas wrote: 'Smug? Potentially increasing her life expectancy to be able to watch her children grow up and grow old with her husband?'

Joshua Cox tweeted: 'If you listen to the actually story, it's to prevent cancer, I'm sure you'd do it on your battered old daffodil.'

Avril Walkinshaw said: 'That's bad Katie, even for you,'

And follower Nige wrote: 'Wow, sometimes you can go just that little bit to far!'

Ms Hopkin's bizarre tweets come just days after the controversial columnist  said fat children should be forced to attend special sports schools until they shed excess weight.

Writing in her column for Now! magazine, she said: 'The most upsetting thing of all is a fat child.

'Watching fat parents drop their fat kids off at school in their cars makes me so angry my teeth itch and my nipples twizzle.'

In her video blog for the magazine, the mother-of three said she blames the parents for children with weight problems: 'I've always said that a fat child lives in the shadow of a fat parent.

'The fat kids go through the school gates and there's the fat mum in the car, who doesn't bother to get out, still wearing her pyjamas...and that really does my head in.'

Earlier this month, Ms Hopkins caused a Twitter storm when she tweeted controversial comments after she watching Kelly Clarkson on The Graham Norton Show.

She tweeted: 'Jesus, what happened to Kelly Clarkson? Did she eat all of her backing singers?'

Then added: 'Happily I have wide-screen. #grahamnorton'.

When social media users tried to defend the singer, Katie followed up with: 'Look chubsters, Kelly Clarkson had a baby a year ago. That is no longer baby weight. That is carrot cake weight. Get over yourselves.' 

She also compared E! red carpet presenter Kelly Osborne to a troll and criticized Lily Allen live on radio for not losing her baby weight fast enough.

'After she had her baby she did what most mums do, and she kind of went around being lazy and she said, "Oh it's baby weight,"' Katie said. 'I don't agree with that. It's not baby weight, because the baby's already out. It's just weight.' 

Earlier this week, This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield spoke about the star's offensive social media presence in an interview in Heat magazine.

'She does occasionally go way too far and I read things she’s said and think, "That’s so offensive, that will actually hurt people",' he said.

But the presenter did also say he was fond of the star: 'Although she’s the epitome of a pantomime villain, she’s lovely and very likeable off air.'

Angelina's surgery, which Ms Hopkins criticised, comes two years after her double mastectomy and on Monday the  Maleficent star published a piece in Time magazine explaining her decision.

In the article titled, Angelina Jolie Pitt: Diary Of A Surgery in the New York Times, she revealed she had already been planning to undergo the surgery to remove her ovaries and Fallopian tubes, but a call from her doctor two weeks ago made the procedure more urgent. 

The star wrote: 'I went through what I imagine thousands of other women have felt.

'I told myself to stay calm, to be strong, and that I had no reason to think I wouldn't live to see my children grow up and to meet my grandchildren. 

'I know my children will never have to say, "Mom died of ovarian cancer".

Angelina's decision was praised by cancer charities who say the star has raised awareness about early detection and prevention. Katie Hopkins, of course, had her own unique take.
