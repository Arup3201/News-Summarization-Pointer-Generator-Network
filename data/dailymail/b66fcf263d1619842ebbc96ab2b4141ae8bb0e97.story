Brazilian midfielder Sandro has vowed to improve for new club QPR after an underwhelming start to the season.

The former Tottenham man joined the west London club in the summer for £10million but has struggled to find his best form after a knee injury led to a lengthy spell on the sidelines prior to joining.

'To be off the pitch for so long was difficult,' he told QPR's website. 'But when I came back I was so happy, so excited. It felt like my first game ever.

'It (the injury) has made me strong. I believe I will find my level again with QPR. I am doing good at the moment, but I will improve. I feel so good here. Everyone in the changing room makes my life very easy. We all want to win games and fight for each other.'

Harry Redknapp's side are second from bottom of the Premier League table, but after a morale boosting draw against champions Manchester City Sandro believes their luck is about to change. 

He said: 'It is very hard when you go onto the pitch and you lose, and you lose, and you lose. But we have changed this. We play with confidence now.'

'We are all together. It has taken some time to understand, but now we feel so comfortable on the pitch. When we played Manchester City, I thought we were on top of them and deserved to win.'
