Peter Moores has warned England’s under-achieving one-day cricketers that no one’s place is safe after the series defeat by India and he is considering making key changes just five months before the World Cup.

The crushing 3-1 loss, alleviated slightly by a much improved performance at Headingley on Friday, means England will shuffle their pack ahead of the series in Sri Lanka in November in another attempt to find a winning one-day formula.

It remains highly unlikely England will replace Alastair Cook at this stage, even though Moores refused to guarantee that a captain who has spent most of the summer defending his position will lead the side in Australia and New Zealand.

Cuts: Peter Moores is ready to wield the axe and rid England of its under-performing players

Yet while Cook probably stays, others who may not make the cut include Ian Bell, Harry Gurney, Gary Ballance and perhaps even Eoin Morgan, who is under pressure when he leads the Twenty20 side against India at Edgbaston today.

England will consider bringing back Ravi Bopara and James Taylor, while Reece Topley has emerged as a left-arm alternative to Gurney and Samit Patel, persona non grata under the Andy Flower regime, has support for a return.

It is hardly ideal to still be in a state of flux so close to the most important competition in limited-overs cricket but England know changes have to be made even though they displayed a glimpse of their potential in Leeds.

Danger: Ian Bell, Gary Ballance and Eoin Morgan are all in danger of being dropped from the England squad

Moores, who told his squad of his expectations after Friday’s win, is adamant there is nothing wrong with a game plan that has been derided as outdated by high-profile critics such as Graeme Swann and Michael Vaughan but it is the execution of those plans that needs improving.

Bopara was unlucky to be left out of the India series but it has become clear that his omission was far from terminal and he will be given the chance to prove that he can bat in the top six and become England’s sixth rather than fifth bowler.

It remains a mystery why Taylor, who scored 114 for Notts in the One-Day Cup semi-final yesterday, has not had many more opportunities in all formats but, like Bopara, he may be handed a chance to show what he can do both today in Birmingham and in the seven-match 50-over series in Sri Lanka.

Gurney looks too one-dimensional to have a long-term future in international cricket and, with Moores wanting a left-arm seamer, a late chance could come for Topley ahead of Chris Wood as long as he is fully fit.

World Cup: England need to make major changes if they are to stand any chance at the World Cup

Perhaps the biggest issue facing England is the woeful form of their key one-day batsman Morgan, who is in desperate need of a big score today to ease concerns about his form.

It is becoming clear that, when England do decide the time is right to replace Cook as captain, Joe Root is the favourite to take over in all forms of the game, probably usurping Morgan as captain-elect in one-day as well as Test cricket.

The selectors will consider their options over the next two weeks before naming a squad for Sri Lanka that, barring the injured Stuart Broad, will go on to the World Cup.

‘It’s been extremely disappointing,’ said Morgan of a barren run that goes back to his brilliant century against Australia in Brisbane in January. ‘I’ve worked incredibly hard this year but I’ve been light on runs.

Series: England 3-1 defeat to India in their one-day series highlighted the need for change 

‘I’ve been finding different ways to get out. I’ve gone through periods like this and I’ve always come back so I’m confident I will this time.’

It will be fascinating to see how the big-hitting Jason Roy performs today but he remains a big outsider for a World Cup place, not least because England are conscious of the massive gap between international and county cricket.

It is naive to expect a batsman who can whack the ball in the domestic game to instantly produce the goods at the highest level against two new white balls in international one-day cricket.

The difficulties in stepping up have been highlighted by Alex Hales, who was quickly worked out by India’s bowlers in the one-day series and has to counter tactics which have stifled his natural desire to stay leg-side of the ball and hit through the off side.

Despite Hales’s success in international Twenty20 cricket, his example will make England wary of promoting too many county form horses for the World Cup even though they are open to late change.
