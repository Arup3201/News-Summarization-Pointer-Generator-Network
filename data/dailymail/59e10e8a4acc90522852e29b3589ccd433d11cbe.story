Litter police have been told to issue £80 on-the-spot fines for the ‘disgusting and inappropriate’ practice of spitting in the street.

Last month the Daily Mail told how councils had deployed private litter police to hand out fines for dropping items such as cigarette butts, bank cards, nut shells and even pens.

Now Waltham Forest council, in north-east London, will extend the penalties to anyone caught spitting.

Cleaning up its act: Waltham Forest has gone one better than the litter police and will fine anyone caught spitting as well as dumping rubbish on streets

The measure is part of their ‘Wipe It Out’ campaign against environmental crime.

Council bosses say they want to make spitting in public taboo by sending an ‘unequivocal message’ that the streets should be treated with respect.

Last year, neighbouring borough Enfield announced plans to introduce a bylaw to ban spitting. 

It is still waiting for clearance from the Government to enforce the new rules.

Waltham Forest claims it has been able to get around the bureaucracy of introducing a bylaw by deciding to class spit and urine as ‘waste’.

That means litter police who have previously targeted people dropping cigarette butts, crisp packets and takeaway boxes can issue fines to those caught spitting.

The civil enforcement officers can also hand out tickets to people found urinating in the street.Clyde Loakes, deputy leader of Waltham Forest council, said: ‘It’s horrible to witness and leaves an unsanitary mess on our paths and pavements.

‘Why people think it is acceptable to indulge in what must be the most anti-social of all behaviours is a mystery, but they do.

‘In the past people would not have thought twice about throwing a cigarette butt on the pavement, or letting their dog leave a mess on a pathway. 

‘In the same way, I think we need to make spitting and urinating taboo. 

‘I don’t believe the vast majority of people need telling that it is disgusting and inappropriate.

‘But this move sends out an unequivocal message to those people who spit or treat our streets like a toilet. You will be issued with a fine and you find it the most expensive penny you have ever spent.’ 

Councils raise an estimated £5.5million from handing out more than 73,500 litter fines a year. This means around 200 fines are issued every day.

One company, called Xfor, is run by former soldiers. It has been accused of being overzealous in issuing the fines, each one of which can earn the firm up to £45. 

The company has made around £1.6million from the contracts it holds with 15 local authorities. Council bosses insist that they are simply trying to keep their streets clean.

However, complaints have flooded in from people who feel they do not deserve the harsh penalties. 

One woman in Blaenau Gwent, South Wales, says she was fined for accidentally dropping a thread from her glove.

Another was given a £75 ticket for walking her dog in a field she had used for 30 years. 

She had no idea the park had been turned into a no-dog zone because the warning signs had been stolen.

Other people have been fined up to £80 for dropping bits of orange peel, a banana skin and even a single matchstick.
