Top barrister, Warren Grier, who has been found hanged in his farmhouse home in County Durham. Durham Police have launched an investigation but said they were not treating the death of the father-of-two as suspicious

A top barrister has been found hanged in his home in County Durham.

Warren Grier, 45, a father-of-two, lived with his wife Vivienne and family in the picturesque town of Chester-le-street.

Police were called to the scene last Thursday and launched an investigation but said they were not treating the death as suspicious.

His family at his £356,500 home were too upset to speak but his colleagues at his Tyneside-based chambers paid tribute to the 'respected barrister'.

Bryan Dickson, director of chambers at Tyneside-based New
Park Court Chambers, said: 'The sudden death of Warren Grier, an able and
respected barrister, has shocked and saddened his colleagues at New Park Court
Chambers.

'Warren practised in the Teesside area until January 2012
when he decided to move his practice to Tyne and Wear.

'We were delighted that he chose to join us.

'And it’s clear that Warren was building a successful practice
on Tyneside until it was cut short by his untimely death.

'He will be greatly missed by all.'

Mr Grier, who specialised in crime, family law and taxation during his career, was called to the bar in 1989 but prior to joining chambers was a magistrates' court clerk for around 12 years.

For more than two decades he practised in Teesside with Old
Court Chambers, but he transferred to Newcastle earlier this year.

Stephen Constantine, head of chambers at Old Court, said: 'Warren was an extremely popular and well respected member during his time with us.

'We are all greatly saddened by his tragic and untimely
death and send our deepest sympathies to all his family.'

A spokeswoman for Durham Constabulary confirmed they were
called to Mr Grier’s home last Thursday.

She said: 'Police were alerted by the ambulance service to
attend the house in the early morning of Thursday August 2 where the body of a man had been found.

'The death is not suspicious and the coroner has been
informed.'
