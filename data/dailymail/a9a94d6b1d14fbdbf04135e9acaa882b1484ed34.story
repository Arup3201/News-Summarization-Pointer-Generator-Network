A popular New Jersey teacher has been dismissed for streaking around his apartment block.

Mark Bringhurst, 40, was named 2011-12 teacher of the year at Winslow Elementary School, where he had been a fifth-grade teacher for the last eight years.

But police charged Bringhurst for making a naked dash in March and, under new employment laws, he was sacked for acting 'in an improper manner.'

The Daily Journal reports that officers were called to Greenway Village Apartments in West Berlin, New Jersey, on the evening of March 21.

A witness had complained that a naked man was running through the parking lot and he was worried about the safety of children in the area.

The caller also stated that this wasn't the first time that the same nude man had sprinted through the apartment complex.

The police tracked Bringhurst down to his car in the parking lot of an adult bookstore. At first he denied the charge, then admitted he had done it as a dare. The teacher apologized and said he had never intended anyone to see him.

When the teacher asked to be reinstated in his job it initiated a battle between Bringhurst and the school district.

Bringhurst did not dispute the facts of the incident, but claimed he was cooperative with the investigation, that he had sought help immediately after his arrest and that he was no longer in contact with the person that set the dare in the first place.

In August, the Board of Education members voted for Bringhurst's dismissal and his sacking was made public earlier in December.

This case is the first to use a new tenure law that is designed to reduce the amount of time it takes to resolve such disputes.

School arbitrator Robert C Gifford wrote that Bringhurst 'exercised severely poor judgment on more than one occasion. His lack of judgment is not diminished by the fact that his conduct occurred outside the school setting.'

School Superintendent Mary Gruccio claimed the district demanded his dismissal because 'his behavior cannot be tolerated by the Vineland public school district,' reported the Daily Journal.

On their website the apartment block that Bringhurst streaked through claims: 'Greenway Village Apartments offers a relaxing atmosphere that allows you a peaceful alternative to your hectic, daily schedule.

'No matter how stressful your day may be, the serene surroundings of our community will show you how enjoyable it is to come home.'
