Humiliated: Alan Bacon was ordered to perform a dance at a job interview

A university graduate was left 'humiliated' when he was asked to perform a dance at a job interview in a toe-curling scene reminiscent of spoof comedy, The Office.

Self-confessed nerd Alan Bacon spent a week researching electrical high street store Currys in preparation for his interview as an £18,000 a year sales assistant earlier this week.

But to his horror, all of his hard work went out of the window when he was told to make up a dance to an electro-pop record by French duo Daft Punk.

The University of South Wales graduate said he would have been 'in his element' at the store in Cardiff because of his interest in gadgets.

But his dream job quickly turned into his worst nightmare, when he was taken to a room with eight other applicants and ordered to dance.

In a report in The Mirror, he said: 'I felt so embarrassed and uncomfortable.

'I ended up dancing to Around the World by Daft Punk, doing rubbish robotics in my suit in front of strangers.

'It was so degrading. I told my dad it was like a scene from The Office.'

In the cringe-worthy episode of the BBC 1
comedy, Ricky Gervais, playing the lead character of David Brent, 
performs an impromptu disco dance to his stunned team, while humming the
tune of Disco Inferno.

In an interview on BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Mr Bacon added: 'On the surface I really needed the
job so I thought I’m going to get this over with, I’m going to smile, 
I’m going to do it. But inside it wasn’t a very pleasant experience.

'My
heart immediately sank because I knew that all the effort I had put in 
to trying to learn the brand, what kind of gadgets they were selling.

'No, the first thing they asked us to do was to split up into two groups
and awkwardly dance with each other for them.

'There
was an older gentleman there who was telling us just before the 
interview that he was made redundant from his last job and had recently 
had a child so he was pretty desperate for this job and (we were) watching him 
having to dance to rap music.'

When
he was first invited to the interview, the graduate in documentary, 
film and television had been asked to prepare a short presentation on a 
hobby.

But when he did finally get to talk about his love of taking pictures of outer space, he said he had 'lost all dignity and all sense of 
professionality'.

Spoof: Alan Bacon said his experience at the hands of Currys was straight out of an episode of the TV comedy

Mr Bacon was contacted by the firm a few hours after the gruelling process had come to an end to tell him he had not got the job.

Currys has since apologised for the what it described as a 'mistake'.

A spokeswoman said: 'We
are extremely disappointed that one of the management team at the store
in question did not follow our official recruitment processes on this 
specific occasion - formal processes that ensure we attract, inspire and
retain the right sort of people.

'We are investigating the store member who held the recruitment session.'

Mr Bacon has so far had 300 interviews in his quest to get a job. He was offered a repeat interview by the firm, but declined.

Apology: Currys has offered all nine applicants the chance for another interview, but Mr Bacon has declined
