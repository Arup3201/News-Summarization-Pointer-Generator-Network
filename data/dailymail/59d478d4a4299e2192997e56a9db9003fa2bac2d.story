A mother whose Russian husband snatched their two sons and kept them captive for 18 months has described the moment they were finally reunited after the children were freed in a dramatic raid by Moscow police.

Rachael Neustadt’s sons are now back in Britain living with their mother following a lengthy legal battle in which she won a landmark ruling in Moscow City Court that ordered her estranged husband Ilya to return Daniel, eight, and his six-year-old brother, Jonathan.

When he refused and went on the run with the youngsters, police tracked him to a secluded, one-bedroom apartment in Moscow where they were hiding with his mother.

During the harrowing rescue the boys, who had been brainwashed into believing that their mother was an ogre who wanted to hurt them, were forced by their grandmother to scream in Russian: ‘No, no. We don’t want to go. Mama is bad.’

Speaking for the first time, Rachael, who witnessed the raid, said that when she first saw her sons after being separated from them for a year and a half, she broke down in tears. ‘I just wanted to grab them and hug them,’ she said. ‘But I didn’t want to frighten them, knowing how much they had been through and what they had been told about me.’

The boys, who were wearing only their underwear and hadn’t spoken to their mother for more than a year, had been told by their father that Rachael was a ‘baddy’ gangster who had bandits searching for them. 

By the time Russian authorities finally found the bolthole in which they were imprisoned, the boys hadn’t been to school for seven months and had only been allowed outside one at a time so as not to arouse suspicion.

‘When the bailiff rang the door the grandmother refused to open it,’ Rachael said. ‘She simply would not co-operate. It wasn’t until they started taking off the locks that she finally opened the door.

‘My son told me later that just before his grandmother opened the door she told them that the bandits had arrived and they had to “do what they had practised”.

‘When we entered the apartment she started shouting hysterically. She got them to start chanting with her in Russian, saying I was bad and they didn’t want to go. I couldn’t believe my ears. When I saw them at first they looked so delicate, yet so much bigger than in my memory. My babies had grown so much.

‘It was so calculated and cold-hearted. I was devastated for my children and shocked she could behave like this with children she supposedly loved. But it said it all about child abduction. It is cruel, selfish and manipulative. It has everything to do with power and nothing to do with love.

‘Finally the officials were able to get them all dressed and leave the apartment with them to go to the police station. Even though I was present at the collection, it was only at the police station that we were properly reintroduced.’

Today the boys are back living in Britain and have been reunited with their baby brother Meir, who is two. Clutching her boys tightly, Rachael said: ‘We took it slowly at first, but within a few hours they were returning my hugs and kisses.

‘Jonathan told me happily: “Mummy, you’re not bad! I love you!” Hearing them call me Mummy again brought tears to my eyes. Being separated from my sons was incredibly painful and I lived with anxiety every day.

‘I spent 20 hours a day on the internet and the phone. When children are stolen you fear you’ll never see them again. You pray for a miracle.’ Rachael’s ordeal began after she and Ilya married in Berlin in 2004.

They moved to London in January 2011 and Ilya, who has dual Russian and German citizenship, worked as a full-time lecturer at London Metropolitan University. The couple became estranged after Ilya became controlling and bullying, and later that year they split up.

Rachael, a former teacher from America, realised she was pregnant with Meir only after she had fled the family home.

At first the boys were allowed supervised contact with their father, which later became a regular schedule of overnight stays and holidays. The courts approved a trip to Moscow with their father to visit his extended family in December 2012.

Rachael recalled: ‘It was hard for me to imagine being separated from them for two weeks but I was trying to do the right thing.’

Then, on January 7, her worst fears were realised when she received an email from Ilya saying they would not be returning.

Determined to fight for her children, Rachael set up a campaign and fundraising site on Facebook called Bring Back My Boys. Eventually two meetings were arranged, but when Rachael flew out to Russia, Ilya and the boys didn’t show. After a handful of Skype calls, Ilya cut off all access to the children.

Showdown: Moscow police raided the one-bedroom apartment in Moscow, in the building pictured above, where they found the children with their grandmother 

In the first year after the abduction Rachael’s case was heard in court a dozen times in two jurisdictions. Every single order made demanded that the children be returned to her immediately. But Ilya ignored them all.

Then came the historic Moscow City Court ruling last September. Ilya appealed but after losing his case in November he disappeared, having earlier hidden his mother and the boys in an unregistered apartment to evade complying with the orders.

With the aid of Shaw Graham Kersh Solicitors, Rachael sought an international arrest warrant for Ilya, hoping that if he were found he would be forced to reveal the location of the children.

This was the first case in the UK and in Russia to use the newly ratified 1996 Hague Convention for the Protection of Children.

When news came through that the apartment had been found she was overjoyed. Today, the family is returning to some semblance of normal life.

‘What amazes me is how quickly our bond was re-established, despite their father having done everything he could to eliminate me from their lives,’ she said. ‘The imprint of love from their early years was still there and still strong.’

Rachael was able to claim £40,000 in legal aid to help her battle, and more was raised through the appeal – but she is still £20,000 in debt.
