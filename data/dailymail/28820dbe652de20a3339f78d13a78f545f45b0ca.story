He once labelled climate change 'absolute crap', Tony Abbott was also determined to keep the burning issue off the G20 Summit and was unconvinced Australia should play any part in the recent global climate negotiations in Peru but the Prime Minister .

'Look, climate change is real. Humanity does contribute to it and it's important that government make a strong and effective effort to combat it and that is exactly what the Australian government is doing.

'We are absolutely confident that through the various policies we have in place, particularly our direct action plan, our emissions reduction fund, we are very confident that we can reduce our emissions by 12 per cent on 2005 levels by 2020.'

But Mr Abbott repeated his belief that bushfires, such as those which have crippled parts of South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia this summer, are not the by-product of warmer weather caused by climate change. 

'Climate change is real'. Prime Minister Tony Abbott had made a public admission during a tour of bushfire impacted zones across South Australia

Prime Minister Tony Abbott tours the CFS command centres at the heart of the bushfire zone near One Tree Hill in Adelaide. He refutes suggestions climate change has led to more natural disasters in Australia

'I think it is wrong to try to attribute particular natural disasters to climate change - that is certainly the warning that the CSIRO has given, it's the warning that the Bureau of Meteorology gives, and while there is no doubt that over time climate change could make a difference to these sorts of occurrences, fire, flood, storm are a part of living in Australia - always have been, always will be,' he said.

However, this stance appears to be in direct conflict with the government's environment departmental website which reports that there is 'a growing and robust body of evidence' that the amount of extreme weather events are likely to jump as a result of climate change factors and Australia is already being impacted, as evidenced by the number of bushfiires.

'The important thing is yes we do our bit in tackling climate change but also that we remain very well placed to deal with whatever comes, I think the response to this particular disaster shows that we are well placed to deal with problems,' Mr Abbott said.

'We think that Australia is making a strong and effective contribution to reducing emissions.'

Mr Abbott infamously declared in 2009 the scientific argument was 'absolute crap' but has since stated he accepts humans are contributing to global warming. A year later he declared that global warming 'hasn't increased .. the point is not the science'. The Prime Minister has had a chequered, often thorny, relationship with the issue.

Australia only bowed to international pressure and pledged $200 million to the UN-backed Green Climate Fund, to mitigate the impact of global warming on poor countries.

With the use of coal-fired power and a relatively small population of 23 million, compared to others, Australia is considered one of the world's worst per capita greenhouse gas polluters and has been increasingly isolated over a perceived reluctance to do more to tackle the climate threat.

Mr Abbott speaks with Country Fire Service volunteers in Adelaide. The PM has announced victims of the South Australian bushfires will receive federal assistance during a tour to the bushfire zone

'Fire are certainly not a function of climate change, they're a function of life in Australia,' Mr Abbott has long contended but on Thursday he did admit that 'climate change is real'

Mr Abbott, in the past, took a United Nations executive secretary, Christiana Figueres, to task over her claims that Australian bushfires is 'already paying the price of carbon'.  He accused the official of 'talking through her hat' and that 'fires are certainly not a function of climate change, they're a function of life in Australia'.

He also made a point of preventing climate change from being placed on the official agenda of the G20 in Brisbane last year and was latterly accused of trying to block Australia's involvement in the Climate Change forum in Peru. That subsequently led to a showdown with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop.

Post the summit, he didn't mince words again, saying 'we are doing a very great deal and I suppose given what we are doing we don't intend at this time to do more'.

The PM, who is also the Minister for Women, lauded the axing of the carbon tax, at the third attempt, as his greatest achievement for female Australia.

That's because women were particularly focused on the household budget, he said at the time. And repealing of the carbon tax meant that the average family's budget was better off by $550 a year.

As opposition leader, Mr Abbott in 2010 was dubbed old fashioned after declaring that housewives would bear the cost of a price on carbon pollution through higher electricity charges as they did the ironing.

His stance on cutting greenhouse gases emissions has always come with a rider that it should not 'clobber the economy'.
