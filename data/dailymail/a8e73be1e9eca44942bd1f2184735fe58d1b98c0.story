Tesco's boss admitted today its quarterly results are the worst for 40 years as it emerged a million shoppers a week may be abandoning them for rivals.

Britain's biggest grocer says like-for-like sales fell more than 3.7 per cent in the first quarter of 2014 – far worse than the 2.9 per cent drop in the previous three months.

Chief executive Philip Clarke, whose job may be under threat, unveiled the deepening sales decline today and said they are the worst he had seen in four decades at the supermarket.

Supermarket crisis: Tesco, Britain's biggest grocer, has posted a 3.7% drop in like-for-like sales for the last quarter - considered the worst figures for 40 years by its boss

Mr Clarke refused to be drawn on when sales would start to increase again but declared 'I'm not going anywhere'.

He added: 'There hasn't been a quarter of like-for-like sales like this before that I can remember, but I've never seen a period of such intense transformation for the industry.'

It is also the third quarter in a row 
that sales have plummeted and the bad news has sent shares downwards this morning.

HSBC
 market analyst David McCarthy said: 'Tesco looks like it is 
experiencing more than one million fewer customer visits per week on a 
like-for-like basis. We assume average expenditure of £25 per lost 
visit'.

Today's results heap more pressure on Tesco
 boss Phil Clarke, amid reports his successors are already 
being lined up.

Despite spending £200million on cutting 
the price of basic items, analysts say Tesco is still perceived as ‘too 
expensive’ compared to the likes of Aldi and Lidl.

But revealing the results, Mr Clarke, maintained there are positive signs for the supermarket.

He said: 'Our accelerated plans are making a real difference for customers and we are more competitive than we have been for many years.'

But he warned that the programme was continuing to disrupt like-for-like sales performance.

Mr Clarke added: 'We are pleased by the early response to our accelerated efforts to deliver the most compelling offer for customers.

'We expect this acceleration to continue to impact our headline performance throughout the coming quarters and for trading conditions to remain challenging for the UK grocery market as a whole.'

Investors are understood to have 
begun discussing his potential replacements, with former Dixons boss John 
Browett linked to the post.

Tesco’s woes have stunned the industry
 with one expert saying such a poor performance would have been ‘almost 
unfathomable in times past’.

Clive Back, an analyst at stockbrokers Shore Capital, said he had ‘never been so gloomy about Tesco’s prospects in 20 years’.

He
 said: ‘We believe Tesco UK is increasingly perceived by customers as 
simply too expensive versus the discounters, Asda and potentially 
Morrisons. That is a dangerous and frankly untenable place for a 
mass-market leader to be.’

Picture of Britain: Tesco is still the UK's biggest supermarket but its market share has shrunk as Waitrose, Aldi and Lidl took shoppers from the 'Big Four'

Tesco is still by far the biggest UK supermarket with 28.6 per of market share, but this is down from 29.7 per cent a year ago.

Asda had 17.4 per cent, Sainsbury's had 16.5 per cent and Morrisons had 11.1 per cent in the year ending March 30. 

But
 all have faced a surge from competitors gobbling up customers, with 
Aldi's share of the market up from 3.4 per cent to 4.6 per cent in the 
past 12 months.

Waitrose
 had five per cent compared with 4.8 per cent last year, and Lidl also 
experienced strong growth in a record-breaking month and now accounts 
for 3.4 per cent of the market.

As well as cutting prices, Tesco has recruited more staff and spruced up its stores in a bid to revive its fortunes.

Big shoes to fill: The grim figures will pile further pressure on chief executive Phil Clarke, who has struggled since he took over from Sir Terry Leahy in 2011

The
 Big Four supermarkets – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons – have 
all suffered at the hands of the discounters as well as premium range 
rivals Waitrose and Whole Foods.

The
 popularity of Aldi and Lidl has increased significantly since the start
 of the recession with the stigma felt by some at being seen in one of 
their stores wearing off.

Industry
 experts say that shopping habits have changed, with the weekly shop 
giving way to more frequent smaller trips as families hunt out the best 
deals and reduce waste.

The pressure on Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke, right, has intensified following another big drop in like-for-like sales. Here is a timeline of the company's performance since he took the helm in 2011.

February 2011

Sir Terry Leahy steps down as chief executive on his 55th birthday after 14 years in charge, overseeing a leap in pre-tax profits from £750 million in 1997 to £3.4 billion at the group's last set of annual figures in April 2010. His record includes the launch of Tesco.com and premium range Tesco Finest and its expansion into America with the Fresh & Easy chain. The market share of the group stands at 30.5%.

January 2012

Less than a year into Mr Clarke's tenure, Tesco shocks the market with its first profit warning in almost 20 years after poor Christmas trading. Shares plunge by as much as 15%, or more than £4 billion. Tesco, in common with the country's three other leading grocers - Wal-Mart's Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - finds itself squeezed by discounters Aldi and Lidl and upmarket grocers Waitrose and Marks & Spencer.

April 2012

The chain unveils a £1billion UK revival plan, which includes upgrading stores, the recruitment of more staff and better prices and value. The initiative follows complaints that its 2,800 stores are cold and industrial with poor levels of service.

April 2013

Tesco reports its first fall in annual profits in 19 years, with post-tax profit tumbling almost 96 per cent to £120million from a year earlier. The figure is hit by a £1.2billion charge on the retailer's US Fresh & Easy chain of around 200 stores as it confirms it will leave the country. The firm also suffers a £804million write-down in the UK on land for more than 100 major stores, bought at the height of the property boom, which will no longer be developed.

February

The supermarket promises to spend an additional £200million on lower prices for basic products, such as carrots, tomatoes, onions, peppers and cucumbers. It will also rein in annual capital spending to no more than £2.5billion for at least the next three years as a result of the dramatic reduction in store expansion - nearly half the £4.7billion spent in 2008/09.

April

Mr Clarke brushes off speculation about his future despite little sign that his £1 billion plan to turn around the retail juggernaut is bearing fruit. Profits fall 6.9% to £3.05 billion for the year to February 22 while fourth-quarter like-for-like sales slumped by 3% as its UK market share falls to 28.6 per cent in the 12 weeks to March 31, from 29.7 per cent in the same period a year earlier.

June

Till-roll figures from Kantar Worldpanel show a decline in Tesco's market share to 29 per cent in the 12 weeks to May 25, compared with 30.5 per cent a year earlier. A day later, the chain reports a 3.7 per cent fall in like-for-like sales for the first quarter of its financial year.
