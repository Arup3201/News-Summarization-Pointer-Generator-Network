Controversial scientist Richard Dawkins provoked fury yesterday after referring to ‘mild date rape’ and ‘mild paedophilia’ in comments on Twitter.

Campaigners for women and child abuse victims condemned the prominent atheist’s posts as ‘offensive and damaging’.

Professor Dawkins, 73, became embroiled in the row when he made a point about logical thinking to almost a million followers on the social networking site.

Shocking: Richard Dawkins's tweets that sparked the Twitter storm. He used the shocking examples as a way to illustrate a type of logical argumen where a comparison does not act as an endorsement

Provocative: Professor Dawkins's comments sparked fury on the social network where one user accused him of being 'a danger to women' while another urged him to 'learn compassion'

The academic sparked anger by choosing the example of sexual abuse to illustrate the idea.

He
 began by writing: ‘X is bad. Y is worse. If you think that’s an 
endorsement of X, go away and don’t come back until you’ve learned how 
to think logically.’

Then 
he added: ‘Mild pedophilia [sic] is bad. Violent pedophilia is worse. If
 you think that’s an endorsement of mild pedophilia, go away and learn 
how to think.

‘Date rape is 
bad. Stranger rape at knifepoint is worse. If you think that’s an 
endorsement of date rape, go away and learn how to think.’

Despite coming under fire from scores of other Twitter users, the evolutionary biologist refused to change the topic.

He
 went on to write: ‘Mild date rape is bad. Violent date rape is worse. 
Is it really so hard to understand that that doesn’t constitute 
endorsement of either?’

Backlash: Some of the tweets written in response to Richard Dawkins. Many were outraged by his apparently casual use of rape, and argued that they made light of the suffering victims endured

The
 professor finally withdrew from the argument after tweeting: ‘What I 
have learned today is that there are people on Twitter who think in 
absolutist terms, to an extent I wouldn’t have believed possible.’

But
 Peter Saunders, chief executive of the National Association for People 
Abused in Childhood, said the scientist had belittled the ‘devastating’ 
effect of sexual abuse.

'Date rape is bad. Stranger rape at knifepoint is worse. If you think that’s an endorsement of date rape, go away and learn how to think'

Richard Dawkins

He 
said: ‘What staggers me is that for such a self-proclaimed intelligent 
man to even talk in these terms is to completely miss the point.

'There 
is no such thing as mild or serious paedophilia. There is child abuse, 
and the consequence for the victim is that they can be scarred for 
life.’

Holly Dustin, 
co-director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said Professor 
Dawkins had ‘minimised’ abuse in his remarks. ‘Richard Dawkins is not 
just engaging in light-hearted philosophical discussion when he talks of
 “mild date rape” and “mild paedophilia”, but minimising these serious 
offences,’ she said.

Shami 
Chakrabarti, of the human rights group Liberty, said even the most 
intelligent Twitter users should sometimes ‘put their smartphones down 
and count to 250’ before commenting on such sensitive topics.

Response: Dawkins sent this tweet towards the end of the lively online debate, mocking some of the harsh criticism he had received

‘There
 is no mild rape, there is no mild paedophilia. These are terrible, 
terrible crimes,’ she told the Daily Telegraph website.

Professor Dawkins, an Emeritus Fellow at New College, Oxford, has previously triggered outrage with comments about child abuse.

Peter Saunders, National Association for People Abused in Childhood

He
 said in an interview last year that he could not condemn the ‘mild 
paedophilia’ he experienced at boarding school, adding: ‘We must beware 
of lumping all paedophiles into the same bracket.’

However
 in a statement on his website last night, he said he ‘was only talking 
logic’, and had ‘no desire to make light of the seriousness of any kind 
of rape or [sic] pedophilia’.

In 2011, the then justice secretary  Kenneth Clarke faced a backlash after referring to ‘serious rape’ in a BBC interview.

He later stressed that ‘all rape is a serious crime’ and that he had used the ‘wrong choice of words’.

Controversial: Richard Dawkins

Professor Richard Dawkins has a history of sparking debate with his controversial views.

In the past he has claimed that forcing a religion on children without questioning its merits was as bad as 'child abuse'.

The leading atheist said he was against the 'indoctrination of religion' and teaching it as fact.

Professor Dawkins's best-selling book The God Delusion argues that belief in a supernatural creator is irrational and harmful to society.

In
 an interview, he claimed he had been told by a woman that while being 
abused by a priest was a ‘yucky’ experience, being told as a child that a
 Protestant friend who died would ‘roast in Hell’ was more distressing.

In
 remarks to Qatar-based TV network Al Jazeera, he said: ‘Horrible as 
sexual abuse no doubt was, the damage was arguably less than the 
long-term psychological damage inflicted by bringing the child up 
Catholic in the first place.'

Last
 month he told an audience at the Cheltenham Science Festival that fairy
 tales and believing in Father Christmas could cause children harm.

He suggested it was 'pernicious to instil in a child the view that the world is shaped by supernaturalism.'

In
 2013 he made headlines when he wrote on Twitter that a single college 
at Cambridge University had won more Nobel Prizes than all the world’s 
Muslims. His comments sparked fury on the social network where he was accused of disguising his ‘bigotry’ as atheism.

He
 responded to the barrage of ensuing criticism by telling his 782,000 
followers: ‘A statement of simple fact is not bigotry. And science by 
Muslims was great in the distant past.’

He
 also declared victory for Osama Bin Laden after he had a jar of honey 
confiscated while he was going through airport security last November.

Last
 September, Professor Dawkins was once again embroiled in controversy 
when he said that it was important to distinguish between varying levels
 of paedophilia, and that cases involving rape and murder should not be 
compared to 'mild touching up'.
