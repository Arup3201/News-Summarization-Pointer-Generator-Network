Pharmaceutical tycoon Jonah Shacknai had planned to propose to his beautiful girlfriend, who was found hanging naked from a second-floor balcony at his historic California mansion.

A friend has revealed the millionaire wanted to 'spend the rest of his life' with Rebecca Nalepa, who died two days after Mr Shacknai's six-year-old son Max was fatally injured when he fell down the stairs.

The news came a day after police revealed Mr Shacknai, who has been married twice before, had a stormy and violent relationship with his ex-wife, Max's mother Dina.

Marriage plans: Jonah Shacknai reportedly told friends he 'wanted to spend the rest of his life' with Rebecca Nalepa, found dead last Wednesday

They repeatedly accused each other of physical and verbal abuse as their marriage broke down, and three times the fights became so violent they called police.

Their six-year-old son died in hospital on Sunday, almost a week after he fell down the stairs while in Miss Nalepa's care.

Last Wednesday she was found dead, hanging naked from a second-floor balcony with her hands and feet bound with orange electrical cord.

San Diego police are still investigating the case, amid mounting speculation 32-year-old Miss Nalepa committed suicide out of grief for Max's death.

She had been dating Mr Shacknai for two years, and last December quit her job as an ophthalmic technician to devote herself to him and his three children at his historic Spreckels mansion in the affluent Coronado suburb of San Diego.

The 32-year-old had recently finalised her own divorce, and in May officially filed to revert back to her maiden name, Zahau.

A friend close to Mr Shacknai told Radar: 'It was a very serious relationship. There was a lot of love there.

Jonah
had every intention of proposing to Rebecca. Jonah wanted to spend the 
rest of his life with her.'

Her sister, Mary Zahau-Loehner, has vehemently denied that her sister committed suicide, telling ABC: 'Rebecca was a beautiful, vibrant, loving and kind person and she would never do this to herself.'

Today Reed Holman, a personal trainer
at Miss Nalepa's gym, echoed her words, saying: 'She had everything to 
live for, she was young, fit and really beautiful.'

But Mr Holman also speculated she might have been strong enough to carry out the bizarre suicide.

He described Miss Nalepa, who was 5ft
7ins, as a 'super-fit woman who definitely knew how to work out and 
take care of her body.'

She regularly visited the gym to train, most often alone but sometimes with her boyfriend.

Stormy relationship: Jonah and Dina Shacknai called police three times with allegations of violent domestic disputes as their marriage broke down

He said: 'She was a strong woman. In my opinion she would have been capable of tying her feet and hands 
together and hanging herself although I know this seems unlikely to a 
lot of people.

'Whether she did or not I don’t really know because I’m not a detective -
it’s a really sad story all round because she seemed like a really 
happy and responsive person.'

Yesterday a source revealed Mr Shacknai and his ex-wife had donated Max's organs after his death.

The friend said: 'Jonah and Dina were given some solace knowing that three families were able to avoid the horror they are going through.'

Appalling accident: Max Shacknai fell down these stairs last week. He later died in hospital, just days after his father's girlfriend was found hanged

Mr Shacknai is now said to be 'in seclusion' as he mourns the loss of his son and his girlfriend.

A source said: '[He] is absolutely inconsolable. Dealing with the loss of his only child and his girlfriend, it's just an epic tragedy.'

Homicide Sergeant Roy Frank said police have now searched the house twice as they try to work out what happened to Miss Nalepa.

He told The Arizona Republic: 'There are five possibilities in her death, and we know it wasn't natural or accidental.

'We don't want to say "undetermined" so that leaves homicide or suicide. We want to be very sure which one it was.'

Police are also investigating reports that a loud party was held at the house the night after Max's fall, and just hours before Miss Nalepa died.
