If you have ever bumped your head on a low beam or door frame, you will know it's not much fun.

So spare a thought for poor old fisherman, 6ft 3ins Robert Jones, for whom - as the last occupant Britain's Smallest House - it must have been an almost daily occurrence.

The big man in the tiny house had just two cramped rooms in which he could stretch out his weary limbs after returning home from sea.

But now thousands of tourists from all 
around the world cram inside the pretty 122-inch tall building (10ft) 
every year to catch a glimpse of the 16th century treasure.

Squash: Britain's smallest house has proved to be a big hit with tourists, according to tour guide Anne Fletcher

Located on the west coast of Wales in the sleepy fishing village of Conwg, it can only fit four people at a time and is just 6ft wide.

According to the five members of staff who now offer tours, during peak season dozens of excited visitors from as far afield as America, Japan and Australia line up to get a glimpse of this quirky dwelling.

Local tour guide Anne Fletcher, 58, 
dons traditional Welsh dress to give visitors an authentic experience, 
and explained why the pint-sized home is a mecca for mini-home spotters 
the world over.

She said: 'Thousands of people come to the Smallest House in Great Britain each year. That means we get hundreds of people every week during the height of summer. 

Move over: With only two rooms, there was not much space for a strapping fisherman Robert Jones

Fisherman: Robert Jones spent his days at sea and his nights in this home which now attracts thousands of tourists from across the globe

'I think people are attracted to the novelty of being in such a small space in the knowledge that at one time this was someone’s entire home.

'Tall people in particular can relate to the last occupant, fisherman Robert Jones.

'He was 6ft 3ins tall so would have had an interesting time trying to perform everyday chores.'

The Smallest House in Great Britain is so small it has been officially recognised by the Guinness Book of Records as the UK’s tiniest house.

It was occupied for more than 200-years until Jones finally moved out in 1900.

According to Ms Fletcher, neighbouring houses, which were also tiny, were destroyed by the authorities and there were attempts in the past to demolish the building.

However, local people stood up against town planners and eventually raised enough money to turn Jones's house into the much-loved tourist attraction it is today.

'This house is a great way to show present-day people how we once lived,' added Ms Fletcher.

'There is a little living room with historical pictures and items. And stairs lead up to the six-foot by eight-foot bedroom.

'All the cooking, washing and toilet activities would have been performed outside. For many people this house is a total eye-opener.'

Tourist attraction: Locals saved the house, which used to be one of several, and it is now a popular destination for people from all over the world
