UFC president Dana White was forced to hold featherweight champion Jose Aldo and Conor McGregor apart as the pair faced-off ahead of their UFC 189 main event bout.

McGregor was certainly the more agitated party as he faked a punch towards Aldo before attempting to force his way past White.

Brazilian star Aldo remained calmed and laughed as his opponent moved around the stage before gesturing that the Irishman is talking too much.

The feuding pair will do battle at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas on July 11.

Aldo has held his title since 2010 when UFC merged with the old World Extreme Cagefighting organisation. As the fourth and final featherweight champion of WEC, he carried the belt across. 

Since then, Aldo has won his last seven UFC bouts in a row. Unfazed though, McGregor dismissed him as 'all talk' and 'just mouth.' 

Speaking at a press conference on Monday, McGregor said:  'I expect everyone in the top 10 of the featherweight division to line up and beg for forgiveness, beg to be pardoned!'
