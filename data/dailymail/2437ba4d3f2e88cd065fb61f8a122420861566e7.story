The first pictures of a stomach-turning torture chamber where a British-born Massachusetts resident planned to rape, murder and eat children have emerged.

Prosecutors are pushing for would-be cannibal Geoffrey Portway, 40, to be put away for 27 years after he confessed to plotting the heinous crimes. He will be sentenced next Tuesday.

Photographs taken by investigators of Portway's Worchester home in 2012 show an eerie staircase leading to a hidden basement room containing a 'child-sized homemade coffin,' a steel cage, handcuffs and a set of butcher's knives.

'Portway has pled guilty to some of 
the most vile and heinous crimes known to our society, namely 
participating in the sexual exploitation of young children through the 
possession and distribution of child pornography and soliciting the 
kidnapping of a child for the purpose of killing and consuming that 
child,' federal prosecutors wrote in court documents, obtained by the Boston Herald.

Guilty: Portway, 40, was sentenced to 27 years on Tuesday in Worcester, Massachusetts

The
 sentencing papers, filed yesterday, include frightening excerpts from 
online chats Portway had with like-minded child pornographers and 
potential killers, including Florida puppeteer Ronald Brown who planned 
to kidnap children he knew through his local church.

According
 to the Herald, Brown went as far as to send Portway a photograph of a 
young boy 'with lines drawn on him to identify the different cuts of 
meat.'

The two chatted
 about kidnapping the boy, taking him to a rented house and eating him 
over several weeks before feeding the 'leftovers' to alligators. Brown 
has since been convicted.

In
 May, Portway pleaded guilty to solicitation to kidnap a child and to 
distribution and possession of child pornography. As a British national,
 he will likely be deported after serving his sentence.

Portway had numerous chats with 
individuals about a 'mutual interest in abducting, raping, murdering, 
and eating children,' an agreed statement of facts released by the U.S. 
attorney in Boston in May stated. 

In
 July last year, federal agents searching Portway's residence in 
Worcester discovered the terrifying locked dungeon in the basement of 
his home.

It contained a chair, television, and what appeared to be cable access to the Internet.

The
 room also contained the child-sized homemade coffin that had large 
speakers covering wire mesh at one end and an exterior locking devices.

Strange: Police found various other items including a child's jumpsuit, pictured, in the basement

Locks: The box had straps, pictured, which Portway intended to use to restrain his victim

They also found a steel cage 
approximately 3' wide, 2'high and 4' long with multiple locking devices,
 and a steel table top with steel rings at six points, presumably for 
restraints.

Outside was a cabinet freezer, an upright freezer, disposable scalpels, butchering kits, and castration tools.

This
 dungeon was described in detail by Portway in recovered chats as a 
place he intended to use to keep kidnapped children while he sexually 
abused them and as a place to eventually murder and cannibalize the 
children.

Many of these conversations were accompanied by the trading of child pornography.

These
 chats also included images of children known to them, accompanied by 
discussions of desire to sexually abuse, murder and cannibalize those 
children.

Disturbing: Books and DVDs on cannibalism, pictured, were discovered in Portway's home

Bleach: Investigators also found a bottle of bleach in the dungeon

As stated both in court filings from 
May, through his online chats, Portway solicited several people for 
their help in abducting a child, including Brown and another man called Michael Arnett of Kansas.

At
 least as early as 2010, Portway utilized Skype and other programs to 
communicate with Arnett, trading child pornography including images of 
injured, mutilated and deceased children while chatting about the sexual
 abuse, rape, abduction, murder, and cannibalism of children.

Over
 months, Portway repeatedly solicited Arnett to kidnap a child for him, 
with the intent that Portway would ultimately rape, kill and eat that 
child.

These solicitations 
for help in abducting a child included discussing real children, by name
 and photo, that Arnett claimed to know and have access.

Rope: Other equipment found included 'Japanese Silk Love Rope'

Cage: The cage had a small mattress in it and multiple locks

Sick: Portway's DVD collection contained much inspiration for the gruesome things he planned to carry out

In the chats, 
Portway and Arnett discuss different ways to kidnap children and the age
 range that Portway prefers.

During the time that Portway was soliciting Arnett, Portway had been told that Arnett had helped others with such requests before and that

Arnett had experience with the abduction and sexual abuse of children. Arnett has since pleaded guilty in Kansas to the sexual exploitation of a child for the purposes of producing child pornography.

A forensic examination of the computers uncovered evidence of over 4,500 trades of child pornography between Portway and others.

Many of these trades involved Portway distributing child pornography to others based on their stated specific preferences, including images and videos appearing to depict dead children and the cannibalism of children.

'Clearly, the facts of this case were 
quite disturbing and we are grateful law enforcement acted when they 
did,' said United States Attorney Carmen Ortiz.

'I hope that this case send a clear 
message that we will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law those 
who participate in these types of activities.

'Even though criminals attempt to hide in the anonymity provided by the Internet, the Department of Justice is committed to aggressively pursuing them to ensure that there is no place to hide.'

'An investigation that began in Milford in 2010 — expanded to Europe and beyond —has returned back to where it originally started: the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,' said Bruce Foucart, special agent in charge of the Homeland Security Investigation in Boston.

Locked: The door to the basement, pictured, had a sturdy lock

Meat: Bags of meat, pictured, were found in the man's freezer though none of it was human

Freezer: Portway talked of chopping up little boys, freezing the parts in his freezer, pictured, and eating them over several weeks

'Since we began this operation —Operation Holitna — a worldwide network of offenders has been, and continues to be,unraveled, including Portway.'

Foucart added,'Thanks to the determination of HSI, along with our partners at the U.S. attorney's office, we have been able to rescue 160 children and arrest 51 perpetrators worldwide.

This was all  as a result of the arrest of a Milford man, and subsequent advanced forensics of his digital media.

'Portway's guilty plea should serve as a stern warning to those inclined to abuse children or share images of child pornography: there isn't a place in the United States, on the Internet, or the planet in which you are truly safe. We will investigate you, we will prosecute you and we will bring you to justice.'
