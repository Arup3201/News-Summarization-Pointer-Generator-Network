Evelyn Smith, 7, died in September after a viral infection brought on by croup

A girl of seven suffering from croup died after medics sent her home three times in 36 hours, an inquest heard.

Evelyn Smith had been taken by her parents to a hospital doctor, a nurse at a medical centre and a GP but just two hours after her last consultation she was dead.

The inquest was told there had been a failure to understand the ‘seriousness of her condition’ that led to her death.

Warwickshire Coroner’s Court heard that on September 12 last year her parents, Trevor and Helen Smith, rushed her to hospital in the early hours after she complained she could not breathe.

At Warwick Hospital, she was examined by Dr Emma Sexton and vomited after being given penicillin but was discharged at 4.39am.

Mrs Smith, 48, told the inquest: ‘Evelyn’s temperature rocketed from then on. The lowest I recorded was 39.7C (103F).’

The next morning she took her daughter to a local medical centre where Sister Trudy Hudson prescribed penicillin for inflamed tonsils and sent her home.

She showed some improvement but later that day her temperature shot up again and her parents took her to see a GP.

Dr Susan Martin said Evelyn had ‘oxygen saturations and moderate croup’ – a respiratory infection – and gave her a prescription and said she would feel better ‘in two or three days’.

Two hours later Evelyn collapsed and died at home.

Recording a narrative verdict, Dr Richard Brittain, assistant coroner for Warwickshire, said: ‘There were missed opportunities to diagnose and treat Evelyn appropriately on each of these occasions. 

'However, I am satisfied that none of these consultations were neglectful.

Evelyn was sent home from A&E at Warwick Hospital, a medical centre and a GP's practice before she died after medics 'missed opportunities' to appropriately diagnose and treat her, an inquest heard. The coroner ruled that none of the consultations were neglectful

Croup is a childhood condition that affects the windpipe, the airways to the lungs and the voice box.

Children with croup have a distinctive barking cough and will make a harsh sound, known as stridor, when they breathe in.

They may also have a hoarse voice and find it difficult to breathe because their airway is blocked.

Croup can usually be diagnosed by a GP and treated at home. However, if your child’s symptoms are severe and they are finding it difficult to breathe, take them to the nearest hospital’s accident and emergency department.

Why does croup happen?

Commonly, croup is caused by a virus. Several viruses can cause croup but in most cases it is the parainfluenza virus.

Typical symptoms of croup include:

‘It is more likely than not that her death was preventable although it has not been possible to conclude the causative impact of each missed opportunity.’

In March this year Glen Burley, chief executive of South Warwickshire Foundation Trust, refused to accept doctors had missed opportunities to save Evelyn.

But at the inquest, Helen Lancaster, the director of nursing, did accept more training on the seriousness of croup was needed.

Haidee Vedy, of legal firm Alsters Kelley, who represented the family, said: ‘Evelyn’s death was an absolute tragedy and should never have happened. 

'We will now be investigating further to find out what more could have been done to prevent Evelyn’s death.’

Dr John Omany from NHS England said: ‘We have looked into the circumstances of this tragic case and our priority now is to ensure that GPs across our area are aware of the dangers of croup.’
