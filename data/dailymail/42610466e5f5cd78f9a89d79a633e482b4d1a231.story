Sky Sports pundit Jamie Moore says he has been 'overwhelmed' by messages of support after being 'kneecapped' in Spain after leaving a mansion owned by the son of an Irish drugs kingpin.

The former European boxing champion, 35, was shot in both legs in Marbella over the weekend, where he is based training middleweight Matthew Macklin.

He is now recovering in hospital under an armed guard.

It is believed Mr Moore had been at the Puerto Banus 
home of friend Daniel Kinahan, the son of Irish underworld figure Christy 
Kinahan.

The Kinahan gang is regarded as Ireland’s biggest crime syndicate.

Key members, including Christy Kinahan senior, Daniel Kinahan and his
 brother Christy junior, are on bail in Spain after Operation Shovel in 
May 2010 which shut down their massive drug-dealing empire.

However, they have recovered and now supply an estimated 90 per cent of all the cocaine in Ireland.

It was reported Mr Moore was shot at five times and hit twice in the legs in the early hours of Sunday morning and may have been the victim of mistaken identity.

A source told The Sun: 'Jamie came out of the house and these guys came up to him and shot him in the kneecaps.

'He collapsed to the ground screaming in agony.'

Speaking on Twitter today, Mr Moore said: 'It's at times like this that you realise how well your thought of. I've had unbelievable support. Means a lot it really does.

'Thanks for all the well wishes. Overwhelmed. Gutted and confused about what happened, but thank God I'm ok.'

Mr Macklin confirmed reports that his 
training partner, who is originally from Salford in Manchester had been 
attacked on Twitter.

He posted: 'Just to let everyone know Jamie Moore is still in hospital but he is OK.

'He was shot in his legs but the doctors have said there shouldn't be any serious or permanent damage done.'

A source told the Manchester Evening News: 'It would appear he was out and about, not at the gym, when he was shot.'

Mr Moore's wife Colleen and two young children were at his side in hospital while he receives treatment.

Mr
 Moore was just recently appointed Mr Macklin's trainer after the two 
men, former opponents, engaged in an epic battle in 2006, which Mr Moore
 won by a knockout.

In a career hampered by a niggling shoulder injury, he won the European title in 2009 and was on the verge of a world title challenge before retiring in 2010 on doctors' advice.

He moved into television punditry before recently trying his hand at training fighters, coaching Hull lightweight Tommy Coyle as well as world title challenger Mr Macklin.

Mr Coyle said on Twitter: 'It's not my place to comment on my friend and trainer Jamie Moore's situation.

'Jamie is stable and will be OK, that's all I can say right now.'

Mr Moore was due to be in Macklin's corner for his ring return against Jorge Sebastian Heiiland in Dublin on August 30.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office confirmed that a British national had been shot over the weekend. Local Spanish police are investigating the shooting So far there have been no arrests.
