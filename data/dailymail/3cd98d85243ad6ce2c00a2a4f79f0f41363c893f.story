German rescue workers have managed to reach an injured man trapped 1,000metres underground in 'one of Europe's most difficult caves', but it could still be several days before he is freed.

The 52-year-old German researcher was hit by rocks on Sunday morning as he made his way through the Riesending cave system near Berchtesgaden, on the German Austrian border.

More than 80 mountain rescuers have been working to free him, and although they have now reached the man, who has not been named, the operation to bring him out could still take several days.

Tricky operation: Mountain rescue official Klemans Reindl said his colleagues were at work 'in one of the most difficult caves in Europe', access to which is complicated by water and tight spots

Six experts from Germany, Austria and Switzerland are now with the man, who they say is conscious and able to walk with help.

The accident happened more than three
 miles from the cave entrance, and access to the site -  about half a 
mile underground -  requires covering tricky terrain such as vertical 
shafts and bottlenecks.

The rescue service has set up a radio communication system that allows rescuers to send text messages to the surface.

Mountain rescue official Klemans Reindl 
said his colleagues were at work 'in one of the most difficult caves in 
Europe', access to which is complicated by water and tight spots.

'We have shafts that go straight down 
350 metres (1,150 feet), where you have to rappel down and climb back up
 on a rope,' he told Germany's n-tv television.

A four-member rescue team reached the 
52-year-old German cave researcher yesterday. He had suffered head and 
upper body injuries a day earlier in a rockfall deep inside the caves. 

One of his two companions made a 12-hour solo climb back to the cave entrance to call for help, while the other stayed with him.

Mr Reindl said the cave system has tight spots where only a slim person can squeeze through, and explorers also have to contend with water.

Another mountain rescue official, Stefan Schneider, told a televised news conference that a doctor was in the cave, but it wasn't clear when he could get to the patient.

'It's going round the clock, and it's going to last a few more days,' Mr Schneider said.

Rescuers working in several small teams of up to four people each have laid a telephone line several hundred metres along the route to help with their efforts.

Others have set up camps inside the cave system, which lies on the border with Austria. Fifty-two cave rescue specialists from Bavaria, 28 from Austria and some from Switzerland were at the scene.
