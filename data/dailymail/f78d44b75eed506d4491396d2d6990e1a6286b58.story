Newly released and shocking security video shows the moment an unarmed and handcuffed bodybuilder was shot dead by an El Paso police officer outside the city jail.

The disturbing footage shows former Mr. El Paso, Daniel Saenz, 37, being dragged through the corridors and then outside, after guards refused to admit him because he was harming himself and was bleeding from a head wound.

Once outside, the shirtless man struggles against Officer Jose Flores and another guard who lose control of him - causing Flores to reach first for his taser, then stop and instead pull his gun which goes off when the guard knocks his trigger finger.

Struggle to transport: Officer Jose Flores (in uniform) and Daniel Saenz (shirtless) are seen left and right as Flores and another guardsman try and drag the prisoner to a car to drive him for medical attention

The footage dates from March 8, 2013 and was released by the Texas Attorney General to the El Paso Times who wanted to see the video after a grand jury refused to charge Officer Flores with any crime in February.

Indeed, less than six weeks before the violent death of his prisoner, Flores had become something of a media sensation after being caught on camera buying boots and socks for a cold and hungry 83-year-old homeless man.

On the afternoon of March 8 however, 5 feet, 8 inch tall, 217 pound Saenz had been arrested and brought into custody after acting strangely at a local grocery store and mental health treatment facility.

However, because Saenz 'struck his own head into the doorway causing himself injury' the jail guards and Flores wanted the bodybuilder to travel to hospital for treatment to his bloody injury.

The guard and Flores struggled to get Saenz to cooperate and according to the investigation by CLEAT, the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, Saenz had already been tased five-times already with little to no effect.

Furthermore, Saenz had also been witnessed beforehand performing a dangerous contortionist trick which allowed him to put his handcuffed hands under his body to the front.

This is called 'fronting' and would allow him far more mobility as he resisted.

'In the video, Officer Flores first reaches for his Taser,' said the official investigation from CLEAT. in the El Paso Times.

Deadly: Officer Flores shoots Saenz as his hand is knocked by the guard

'However, he decides not to deploy his Taser because he knew that Mr. Saenz — also earlier that same day — had undergone five cycles of the Taser device, without effect.

'He had been Tased earlier in the day after he assaulted a police officer and other people at the hospital where he was being evaluated.'

According to CLEAT Officer Flores drew his handgun and not his taser because he knew that 'Saenz could quickly front his cuffs and turn them into a deadly weapon, given his considerable strength, agility and demonstrated resistance to the Taser ...

'At the same moment Officer Flores draws his weapon, Mr. Saenz pushes off on that curb and, with remarkable strength, sends the civilian escort flying backwards.

'The civilian escort's arm then hits the trigger hand of Officer Flores, causing his weapon to discharge.'

Emergency: Blood can be seen to have sprayed onto the floor in the aftermath of Daniel Saenz's shooting by Officer Flores

The bullet hit Saenz in the left shoulder and traveled down into his heart. He was treated at the scene by Flores and transported to hospital where he died later.

The autopsy did not find cocaine, PCP or other hard drugs in his system but reported that Saenz tested positive for bath salts.

The video - which was shot from multiple angles - was presented to a grand jury in February, which decided not to charge Flores. However, Flores is currently on leave.

Gentleman: A chance meeting between El Paso police officer Joe Flores and an 83-year-old homeless man resulted in a story that warmed everyone's hearts last year

Jim Jopling, a lawyer with CLEAT who represented Flores, said in their statement that they believe the grand jury cleared Flores because of 'the totality of the circumstances, which include the long sequence of events that came before the shooting itself.'

Prior to the shooting, Saenz had been arrested after attacking an off-duty police officer and the staff at a mental health facility after he had been found harassing elderly people at a supermarket in El Paso.

As Flores and the guard attempt to transport Saenz from the jail to an ER he hit his own head 'into the doorway causing himself injury'.

He is taken outside and struggles for around a minute before twisting and turning violently - causing Flores to reach first for his taser and then his Glock semi-automatic before opening fire.
