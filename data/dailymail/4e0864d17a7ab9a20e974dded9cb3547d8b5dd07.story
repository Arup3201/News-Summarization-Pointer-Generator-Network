Hertfordshire Police are appealing for information following the death of Rebecca Thompson, 11

A badly injured father is under police guard in hospital on suspicion of killing his 11-year-old daughter.

Rebecca Thompson was found by her mother Mary and another man at the family home at the weekend.

Twelve hours earlier the girl's 52-year-old father Simon crashed into a roundabout at high speed.

He was taken to hospital and then arrested after Rebecca's body was found by Mrs Thompson, who sells programmes at Watford Football club, just after midday on Saturday.

Today, curtains at the three-bed semi detached home in Bushey, Hertfordshire, were closed.

Forensic officers spent the weekend at the house gathering evidence.

Neighbour David Pugh, 24, said: 'On Saturday lunchtime a man with a pony tail came into the street and said the little girl was not well.

'Six police cars arrived, paramedics and an ambulance. Mary came out into the street and she left with the police in the back of a car.

'The police came round and wanted to know if anyone had seen her father's car during the night.

'They wanted to know if we had seen or heard anything in the 10 or 11 hours before she was found.'

Simon Thompson is being treated at a London hospital for serious injuries suffered after his grey Golf crashed at high speed at around a quarter past midnight on Saturday at the nearby Elstree Hill roundabout.

Detectives are keen to hear from anyone who either witnessed the collision or saw the vehicle, which has which has a registration number OV61 NVK, prior to the crash taking place.

Hertfordshire Police say the arrested man will be interviewed in due course once he has been deemed fit by medical staff. This is not thought to be possible for several days because of the extent of his injuries.

Neighbour Jenny Coffey, 39, said: 'It is a terrible tragedy. We are trying to work out what happened. If Simon left the house in the car, did he leave her on her own until her mother came home?'

A post-mortem into the Sacred Heart Primary School pupil's death is due to be conducted tomorrow. Rebecca's headteacher Rita Cooper said the whole school had been left 'very distressed' by the tragic news.

She said: 'It is with great sadness that we heard of the death of Rebecca who was in Year 6 at Sacred Heart.

Rebecca Thompson, 11, was found murdered in her home in Homefield Road, Bushey, Hertfordshire. Today, curtains were drawn at the property

Sarcred Heart Primary School in Bushey, where murder victim Rebecca Thompson attended

'Rebecca was a lovely girl who was hard working and did well in her learning. She was looking forward to secondary school.

'The whole school is very distressed by this tragedy and our thoughts are with her family and friends.

'Our immediate concern is to do what we can to enable both children and staff at the school to cope with their shock and grief.'

Rebecca's home has been sealed off as detectives and specialist teams gather evidence and carry out enquiries while a major investigation, led by the Beds, Cambs and Herts Major Crime Unit, is under way.

Detective
Inspector John Arthur, from the Beds, Cambs and Herts Major Crime Unit 
based in Welwyn Garden City is leading the investigation.

He
said: 'The death of a child is always tragic and understandably many 
people will be devastated and concerned by what has happened. Our 
thoughts are with Rebecca’s family and friends at this terrible time.

'Detectives and specialist teams investigating the circumstances surrounding Rebecca’s death are working to get a better understanding of the facts in this tragic case.

'I have two key appeals to make from the public - did you see the VW Golf which would have been driven at high speed just prior to the crash at the Elstree Hill roundabout in the early hours of Saturday morning? This is a very important element to this investigation.

'I am also very keen to hear from anyone who saw, or knows where Rebecca had been during Friday June 21. Who was she with? Where was she and what time?'

 

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
