Sainsbury's is giving away 20million vouchers a month in a bid to overtake Asda as the UK¿s second biggest supermarket

They've wooed us with buy one get one free offers, value ranges and loyalty card reward points.

Now supermarkets are tapping into the growing trend among families for using coupons at the tills to get us through the doors – and beat rival chains in the supermarket wars.

Sainsbury’s is giving away 20million vouchers a month in a bid to overtake Asda as the UK’s second biggest supermarket.

The aggressive voucher strategy has helped the group to increase its sales faster than its biggest rivals Tesco, Asda and Morrisons.  

Yesterday Sainsbury’s reported an impressive annual sales increase of 4.6 per cent to £25.6billion, while underlying profits to the end of March were up 6.2 per cent to £756million.

Research by the supermarket found 93 per cent of us use coupons to save money on grocery shopping, while 30 per cent have increased our coupon usage in the last year.  

It also discovered families living in the well-heeled counties of Sussex, Kent and Warwickshire are most likely to redeem vouchers, showing  how popular the couponing trend has become among middle-income families living through the biggest squeeze on living standards since the Second World War.

Under its Brand Match coupon scheme, Sainsbury’s has issued 350million vouchers since 2011 to customers spending over £20, regardless of whether they have a Nectar loyalty card. 

The scheme works by calculating whether a customer has bought any big brand products, such as Kellogg’s or Heinz, which are cheaper at rivals Tesco or Asda.

If the customer could have saved money by going elsewhere then the till prints out a paper coupon worth the difference.

Sainsbury’s is now issuing around 20million of the coupons a month.

The Brand Match scheme has been such a success that Tesco launched its own version with added benefits in March. Its Price Promise promotion reimburses customers at the till if their shopping would have been cheaper at Sainsbury’s, Asda or Morrisons. 

Crucially, it goes further than Sainsbury’s to include a comparison of own-brand products.The level of competition shows how much is at stake for the supermarkets.

Sainsbury’s was overtaken by Asda at the UK’s second biggest supermarket in 2008. 

However, it has achieved an annual growth in sales for 33 quarters in a row and is closing in on its nearest rival with market share of 16.8 per cent versus 17.5 per cent for Asda. 

The Sainsbury’s results were boosted by non-food sales, such as its Tu fashion range, electrical goods and furniture, which reached £1billion for the first time. Grocery sales online were close to £1billion, while Sainsbury’s Local convenience stores took £1.5billion.

Chief executive Justin King said: ‘Whilst we see no near-term change in the current economic situation, we remain confident that by continuing to invest in our long-standing strategy and by understanding and helping our customers, we are well positioned for future growth.’ 

On Saturday, the Daily Mail highlighted the case of 16-year-old Jordon Cox who has taken collecting coupons to extraordinary lengths.

He bought £105.88 of goods, such as big brand breakfast cereals, cheese and drinks, but handed over just £1.62 at the till thanks to his coupon collection.

Meanwhile research from the Institute of Grocery Distribution suggests many household are changing the family diet based on vouchers.

Some 62 per cent of wealthier families changed the food they bought to take advantage of vouchers and promotions.
