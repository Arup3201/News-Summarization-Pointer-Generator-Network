A newborn baby died at just eight hours old after her mother was made to wait three-and-a-half hours for a caesarian, an inquest heard.

Mary-Jayne Harrison’s baby Jessica died at Southend Hospital, Essex after picking up an infection before her birth.

The one specialist in duty ordered a caesarian but was then called to deal with another birth and midwives decided not to call for another specialist because they 'hoped for a good outcome'.

Pauline Moore, the midwife in charge of coordinating staff that night, was asked why she didn’t call the extra consultant, during the case at Chelmsford Coroner's Court on Wednesday. 

Assistant coroner Yvonne Blake asked: 'Women give birth at inconvenient times, you must have called for help at inconvenient times before, why didn’t you call for help on this occasion?'

Mrs Moore replied simply: 'Because we hoped for a good outcome.'

There was a muted response.

The mother went into labour shortly around 9.40pm on September 29 last year.

By 3am the pregnancy had not progressed at adequate speed, and Dr Fozia Malik, the specialist registrar, decided to send her for a caesarean.

However, he was then sent into theatre to help a woman two rooms away who had been fully dilated for two hours, was not on painkillers and was slightly overweight.

By 4am, Ms Harrison was showing signs that she was suffering from an infection and was given antibiotics and paracetamol through a drip.

The inquest is being held at Chelmsford Coroner's Court (pictured) and is expected to conclude today

She was not seen again by Dr Malik until about 6am, by which time it was too late to perform a caesarean, and Jessica was born around 6.30am by forceps delivery.

Jessica showed signs of inhaling meconium, a baby’s first stool passed when in distress in the womb, and doctors tried to get her breathing on her own.

However, they were unable to help her survive longer than eight hours.

She had no other underlying health issues.

Dr Malik and two midwives told the inquest that with hindsight they would have acted differently, but said Mrs Harrison didn’t appear to be an emergency case and that the other birth took longer than expected.

Mrs Harrison, questioning Dr Malik, said: 'Three-and-a-half hours, I think that’s too long, so much could be done in that time.'

The doctor replied: 'I wouldn’t have planned three-and-a-hours hours but there was an emergency, I was tied up elsewhere.”

The inquest also heard evidence suggesting that a speedier delivery may not have helped Jessica.

Pathologist Michael Ashworth said: 'The infection must have been picked up from the umbilical chord in the womb, so it was before birth, but I am unable to say if it was hours, days or whatever period.”

The inquest is expected to conclude today.
