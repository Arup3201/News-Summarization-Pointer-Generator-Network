It is the start of the Chinese Lunar New Year and the Year of the Sheep is being celebrated in style around the world.

Locals and visitors alike have taken to the streets, particularly in countries where it is a public holiday, like Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia.

Known as Tet in Vietnam and Seollal in South Korea, the 40-day festival is traditionally a time to be with family but involves spectacular dances, dangerous stunts and the traditional gifting of hong bao packets.

Dating back as far as the 14th century, this year's celebrations will mark the beginning of year 4713 on the Chinese calendar. 

It marks the beginning of a new agricultural season, as well as a new year, and is considered a time to reunite and take part in traditions intended to bring good fortune over the coming 12 months.

In China, this period is also known as the Spring Festival, and traditionally, it kicks off with a large meal known as the reunion dinner where dumplings and fish are served as symbols of prosperity. 

Families take great care to be together on this night, which is usually held on New Year's Eve.

Many cities put up colourful decorations for the season and engage in celebratory parades, dancing Chinese dragons, and fire displays.

The colour red is most often used, as the hue is believed to ward off evil and is associated with luck. It's also customary to wear new red clothes to symbolise a new start. 

The burning paper money as an offering to ancestors is also traditional New Year activity in some areas. 

This year, the Tibetan New Year also falls on February 19, the same day as the Chinese Lunar New Year, which the autonomous region celebrated with a fireworks display above the Potala Palace.

People also exchange red packets, called 'hong bao,' to celebrate, which children often open on New Year's Eve. These contain 'lucky' cash.

Each country, however, typically has its own traditional foods for the celebration.  

One commonality is the idea of 'out with the old and in with the new.'

In the lead up to the celebrations, houses are cleaned from top to bottom, with some Chinese people even taking a bath in pomelo leaves to enhance their prosperity further.

Following such a bath, it's also traditional not to wash your hair during the initial days of the new year so as to not risk washing out any of your newly acquired good luck. 

Though widely referred to as the year of the sheep, 2015 is also known as the year of the goat, because the Chinese character is the same for both.
