Two Philadelphia police officers were charged Thursday with aggravated assault for beating up a man riding a scooter in an unprovoked attack that was caught on a surveillance camera.

A grand jury brought the police brutality charges against officers Sean McKnight and Kevin Robinson, finding they allegedly knocked Najee Rivera off his motorized scooter and pummeled him with fists and baton in May 2013, Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said during a press conference announcing the charges.

Surveillance footage from a business recorded at least some of the beating, said the district attorney's office in Philadelphia.

Beaten to a pulp: Rivera, 23, suffered a fractured orbital bone and numerous head lacerations

Prosecutors said the officers later lied about the attack, accusing the victim of assaulting Robinson.

Rivera, 23, suffered a fractured orbital bone and numerous head lacerations. Prosecutors said there was so much blood on the ground around Rivera that another officer who arrived on the scene thought he had been shot, according to NBC Philadelphia. 

Robinson, 26, a six-year veteran, and 30-year-old McKnight, who has been on the force for seven years, are now facing charges of aggravated assault; simple assault; criminal conspiracy; reckless endangerment; tampering with public records; false reports of law enforcement authorities; obstruction and official oppression.

At 10pm on May 29, 2013, Najee Rivera was riding his scooter near North 7th and Somerset streets when he was pulled over by police.

According to investigators, the 23-year-old driver became fearful and took off.

In the officers' version of events originally offered to their superiors, what happened next was that Rivera fell from his scooter and hurt his face.

After being pummeled with fists and a baton, Rivera was handcuffed and left bleeding on the ground for several minutes 

Robinson and McKnight’s report also stated that the 23-year-old violently resisted arrest by assaulting the six-year police veteran.

But surveillance footage from a nearby business, which has been obtained by Rivera's girlfriend and later aired by 6ABC, tells a markedly different story.

Prosecutors say the grainy video, which the woman tracked down by canvassing area businesses, shows one of the cops reaching out of the squad car window and clubbing Rivera in the head.

The police car then bumps the scooter, sending Rivera tumbling to the ground.

Robinson and McKnight emerge from the car and proceed to repeatedly strike the man with their fists and a baton, the prosecutors said. 

'He never resisted. he never struck them. he never fought back. they just started hitting him,' Williams said.

Following the assault, Rivera was placed in handcuffs and kept on the ground for several minutes while bleeding profusely. He was then booked on charges of resisting arrest and aggravated assault.

But the case against Rivera fell apart when his girlfriend turned the damning surveillance footage over to police.

Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey told reporters Thursday that Robinson and McKnight have been suspended for 30 days with intent to dismiss from the force.

The two cops have been off the streets for the past two years.

'What they did was totally inappropriate, totally in violation of policy, training, anything, period," Ramsey said.

District Attorney Williams has vowed to prosecute Robinson and McKnight to the fullest extent of the law, declaring that police officers are 'not above the law,' and that even if Rivera 'had been the devil himself,' they were not justified in treating him they way they did .

Rivera filed a federal lawsuit and won a $200,000 settlement from the City of Philadelphia.
