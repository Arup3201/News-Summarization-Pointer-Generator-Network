If you’re struggling to keep up with the demands of your New Year’s resolution, then take inspiration from the man who prides himself on being the king of personal challenges.

In 2013, Michael Bandar undertook 12 mammoth tasks such as kayaking to work, taking singing lessons and striking up conversations with complete strangers every day, for a month at a time.

His other missions included learning to speak French, getting in touch with long-lost friends or family members, practising meditation and eating meat after being a vegetarian for over 15 years.

Inspiration to us all? Michael Bandar undertook twelve eccentric 30 day challenges such as kayaking to work, taking singing lessons and striking up conversations with complete strangers

Michael, 24, from Birmingham said: 'Instead of making one year-long resolution that people tend not to keep, I listed twelve things that I wanted to try or give up. I then structured them as 30-day challenges to do throughout 2013.

'Looking back on the last year, I’m really proud of what I’ve accomplished. Every month, I did something different every day and stayed out of my comfort zone.'

Michael - who is the director of dating website, Toyboywarehouse.com - admits that some of the challenges were tough.

'One of my trickiest assignments was in September when I had to speak to a stranger every day for at least ten minutes.

'I looked like a right weirdo introducing myself to random people on the street but during the course of that month, I met some fascinating people.

In January 2013, Michael Bandar, 24, went for a month with no TV, going to the gym everyday instead; in February he meditated for an hour every day

In March, Michael ate meat everyday, despite being vegetarian for fifteen years, and in April studied French for an hour a day

'Another hard challenge for me was "Meaty March" when I ate meat every day for a month after being veggie for over half of my life. When I started that task, I hated the taste of meat but I don’t mind it anymore. I actually love Pepperami now!'.

In July, Michael’s challenge involved kayaking two miles to his office every day: 'Rowing a kayak to work on the canals provided a lot of entertainment to passers-by. Often, people would walk alongside me and chat to me while I was doing it.'

Michael says that he picked up some valuable abilities through embarking on these 30-day-challenges. 'Taking daily singing lessons probably wound my neighbours up but I can now sing well.

In May, Michael wrote 500 words every day and in June he woke at 6am daily as part of his mammoth task

In July, the dedicated man kayaked the two-mile journey to work everyday and in August, he went teetotal

'Additionally after learning French every day for a month, I have a good conversational knowledge of the language. I’m even going to Paris in 2014 to fine-tune my linguistic skills.'

Michael claims that these 30-day challenges are far more worthwhile than the traditional New Year’s resolutions.

He said: 'I couldn’t recommend them enough - a month is the ideal amount of time to lose a bad habit or experience something new.

In October, Michael took singing lessons and practiced everyday, and in September, spoke to a stranger for a minimum of ten minutes each day

In November, the 24-year-old swam 1km every day and in December, spoke to old friends and family as part of his New Year's challenge

'It’s very easy to get stuck in a rut but 30-day challenges are the perfect way to keep things fresh. I plan to continue doing them for the rest of my life.'
