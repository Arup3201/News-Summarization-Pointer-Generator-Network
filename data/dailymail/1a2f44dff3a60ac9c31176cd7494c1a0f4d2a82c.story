A man is accused of raping his 'sex buddy' after she told him she had started a new relationship and didn't want to cheat on her new boyfriend, a court heard.

It's alleged Shahzaman Meah, 28, raped the woman in her flat.

Meah went on trial today at Luton Crown Court, pleading not guilty to raping the 25-year-old woman at her home in Leighton Buzzard, Bedfordshire, on May 1, 2011.

Luton Crown Court heard how Meah is accused of having sex with the woman against her will in her Bedfordshire home

Prosecutor Isabel Delamere said that Meah, of Bedford, and the woman had met four months earlier and had become good friends.

They were both single and they would phone and text each other and see each other occasionally at her flat.

Miss Delamere said that by February 2011 the victim, in a series of text messages to the defendant, told him she wanted a relationship but didn't feel she could get into anything too deep.

She texted him saying that she 'would like to find is a friend with benefits.'

The prosecutor said that Mr Meah replied with a text saying 'You want a s*** buddy.'

A series of text messages between the pair led to them then arranging to have sex with each other.

The court heard that the pair had sex on a number of occasions following that but, by April of 2011, she had started a relationship with a new boyfriend.

The prosecutor said that on April 14 that year, the woman sent Mr Meah a text saying 'When you do see me next time, it will be strictly a friendship.'

Miss Delamere said 'He texted back: "We can s***, right?" to which she replied "No sorry babes".'

The prosecutor said that when the defendant then sent a text asking why she would no longer sleep with him, and she said she did not want to cheat on her partner.

Miss Delamere told the jury 'She is telling him - no more sex.

'By April, she has made it perfectly plain she is in a relationship and is happy to chat.'

The court heard on in May 2011 at around 9.30pm, the defendant is alleged to have arrived at the woman's flat, having been drinking.

Miss Delamere said that when the defendant tried to touch her breasts, the woman told him 'No, stop it, it's not going to happen.'

It's alleged that, moments later, he attacked her and had sex with her against her will.

Arrested later that night, the defendant is alleged to have told police in an interview 'It's ridiculous, she invited me in' and said he had had sex with her on three previous occasions.

Miss Delamere told the jury that the issue for them to consider was whether the woman had consented to sex that night.

The case continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
