Neymar was the star turn as Brazil trained ahead of their second group match with Mexico.

The Barcelona forward scored twice when the hosts opened the tournament with a 3-1 victory over Croatia on Thursday.

But Neymar was doing very little with a football on Saturday, instead catching the eye with his sock-juggling routine and a karate kick on team-mate Fred – who managed to keep his feet this time, unlike against the Croats when he tumbled controversially for the award of a first-half penalty.

And
 the 30-year-old Fluminese striker has spoken for the first time about 
the incident which led to his side's equalising goal.

‘I controlled the ball with my right foot and I was turning left when I was bumped into the shoulder,’ he said.

‘As
 a result, I couldn't reach the ball, lost balance and fell. I really 
lost balance, you have no idea. I did not dive, that's sure.

‘I'm
 not the kind of players to fall down. The same happened against Serbia,
 and even on the ground, I reached the ball and scored.’

Brazil now face the Mexicans in Fortaleza knowing that a victory could see them become the first country to book their place in the second round.
