London families are being warned not to pour Christmas dinner remains down the drain over the festive season - or face the prospect of clogging up sewers.

Thames Water, the company responsible for public water supply and waste water treatment, has revealed that blockages in the sewer system rise by around 25 per cent at this time of year.

And the main culprits identified are 'festive fatbergs' - or, the 'hideous concoction of turkey drippings, oil from your roast veg and fatty gravy'.

Thames Water has pleaded with families to watch what goes down the drain this Christmas fearing blockages

Danny Brackley has been working in the sewers for four years and said they cost £12 million a year to repair

Mr Brackley said the biggest blockage he had to deal with was nine double-decker buses worth of cooking fat and wet wipes underneath Leicester Square in central London in 2010

According to deputy chief sewer flusher Danny Brackley, London's sewers cost £12 million a year to repair.

He said: ‘The biggest blockage I had to deal was nine double-decker buses worth of cooking fat and wet wipes underneath Leicester Square in 2010. We had to use pressure jetting to get rid of it - the smell is horrendous if you're not used to it.

‘When the fat congeals it takes the oxygen out of the atmosphere so we have to be really careful not to be poisoned, it also gives out nitrogen and methane gas.’

Mr Brackley, who is now starring in radio adverts to prevent sewer abuse, believes our diet is partly to blame.

Mr Brackley, who is now starring in radio adverts to prevent sewer abuse, says people's diet is partly to blame

He explained that since the 1980s, and the rise of fast food, grease has become more of a problem.

‘Fat and wet wipes can build up right outside your front door, building up until the sewer blocks and raw sewage is spilling out over the road or even worse, up through toilets into their home,' he said.

‘To avoid this, you should wait for the cooking fat to cool, pour it into a container and put it in the bin.'

Workers have previously found bullets, live hand grenades and half a Mini Cooper in London's sewer system

Debris: Mr Brackley never ceases to be amazed what can be found inside London's sewer system

He said: 'We regularly come across old coins or Second World War bullets and one of my colleagues once found a hand-grenade. We also once found half of a Mini Cooper car - we still can't work out how it got in there'

Mr Brackley, 26, who has worked for Thames Water for four years, said he continues to be amazed by the variety and scope of his job.

‘The best thing about the job is seeing the incredible architecture of the sewers, much of it dates back to the 1960s but the worst thing is the way people abuse them and put the wrong things down there,' he said.

‘We regularly come across old coins or Second World War bullets and one of my colleagues once found a hand-grenade.

‘We also once found half of a Mini Cooper car - we still can't work out how it got in there.’
