Bob Wilson, 72, will undergo treatment for prostate cancer, but hopes to return to public life in the near future

Former goalkeeper and veteran broadcaster Bob Wilson has been diagnosed with prostate cancer.

The 72-year-old, who made 234 appearances for Arsenal in the 1960s and 1970s and was capped by Scotland, has cancelled upcoming work and charity commitments, including those for the charitable Willow Foundation that he founded with his wife Megs.

The pundit, who retired from playing in 1974 but took up a role as a goalkeeping coach with Arsenal for several years, was at Wembley for the Gunners' FA Cup semi-final victory over Wigan Athletic yesterday.

He is set to undergro treatment for the disease and is confident he will return to public life as soon as possible, he said.

Wilson, who also worked as a television presenter for BBC and ITV, said: 'I am very confident that the treatment I am receiving will prove successful and kindly ask that my privacy is respected at this time.'

His son, BBC Radio 4 presenter John Wilson, said: 'Knowing how strong my dad is, I have every faith he will be back to match fitness very soon indeed.'

Wilson's daughter, Anna, died in 1998 aged 31 after succumbing to a rare form of cancer.

Her widower, 44-year-old Mitchell Carey, died in 2010 in hospital from an acute bout of food poisoning.

Wilson started his career at the age of 21, initially training as a teacher because his father did not think it was a reasonable job.

He signed for Arsenal in 1963 after playing a number of reserve games for Wolverhampton Wanderers.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in men in the UK, although the numbers of those with the disease is on the rise.

Every year in the UK more than 40,000 men are struck with prostate cancer.

Around 250,000 are currently living with the disease, with symptoms including frequent trips to the toilet, pain during sex and reduced flow of urine.

However, not all men diagnosed with prostate cancer have symptoms, meaning it is important to speak regularly with doctors.

Treatment can include keyhole surgery and radiotherapy.

A Prostate Cancer UK spokesman said: 'We send Bob Wilson our best wishes in his fight against prostate cancer.

'A key figure in the football world, he has already been affected by the tragic consequences of cancer, and his tireless work for the Willow Foundation, set up in the memory of his late daughter, continues to this day.

'It says everything of the man that he has already pledged to return to those efforts as soon as he can.

'Prostate cancer is an opponent like no other. It is the most common cancer diagnosed in men in the UK and affects one in eight men in the UK.

'Our Men United v Prostate Cancer campaign aims to raise awareness and intensify the search for more reliable tests and treatments.

'The football family stands behind Bob, and we offer him and his family our support and best wishes at this important time.'
