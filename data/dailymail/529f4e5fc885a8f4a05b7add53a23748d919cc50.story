This is the moment a family hatchback rolled down a hill - in the world's biggest zorb.

British engineers at Nissan spent two months creating the giant inflatable bubble, which is six-metres in diameter, in Sunderland.

They inflated the zorb around the hatchback at the top of a hill before letting it tumble down head over wheels.

The family hatchback was sent down a hill in a zorb as part of a stunt to show off car manufacturer Nissan's new safety technology

The CarZorb, which is made up of two inflatable layers to shield the Note from outside dangers, rolled down the steep hill hitting a top speed of 20mph before coming to a standstill.

The stunt took place at a military facility in the UK.

Zorbing, which was invented in New Zealand, has become increasingly popular in recent years, with thrill-seekers strapping themselves into a huge inflatable ball ball before hurtling head over heels down a hill. 

Nissan say they built the CarZorb to highlight the safety shield technology of their family hatchback Note, which is also built in Sunderland.

Bastien Schupp, vice president strategy and marketing at Nissan, said: 'The Nissan Note has been carefully engineered to provide motorists with a whole range of technology that creates a protective bubble around you and your car.

'Our Safety Shield technology in particular is unrivalled amongst other small family cars.

'Creating a life size CarZorb to highlight the technology is an exciting and memorable way of reminding people about the benefits of Nissan's Safety Shield.'

Engineers carefully packed the car into the zorb before inflating the giant plastic bubble around it

Once the CarZorb was fully inflated it was pushed down a steep hill head over wheels but the car remained cushioned by the bubble
