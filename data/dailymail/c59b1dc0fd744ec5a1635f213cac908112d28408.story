The New York family of a newlywed bride killed in India last month are calling for local authorities there to investigate her suicide death, which they are calling 'mysterious'.

Bhoomika Kochhar, 25, from Long Island, was found hanging in the bathroom of her home on June 15 while living in Nepal with her husband and his family.

Her family have accused her husband of driving her to suicide and claims he treated her like a slave, abused her and demanded a dowry.

The pretty 25-year-old told her family she wanted to divorce her husband just two years after they had what was called 'the most extravagant wedding in Nepal'.

Their nuptials took place over three-days and was attended by more than 1,000 people at 
the Hyatt Regency in Nepal.

Suicide: Bhoomika Kochhar, 25, from Long Island, was found hanging in the bathroom of her home on June 15 while living in Nepal with her husband and his family

Support: Rep Steve Israel says he is pressuring the Nepal government and will not be satisfied until a full investigation into her death is completed

Distraught: The Kochhar family are calling for a full investigation into their daughter's 'mysterious' death as they believe her husband drove her to suicide

Chefs came from Thailand, Macau, Japan, Dubai and India and her makeup was done by Bollywood artists.

Bhoomika’s sister, Priyanka Kochhar Puri, told the New York Daily News: 'Since her death, we have learned that 
she was regularly and persistently yelled at, locked in rooms, denied 
food, ridiculed and demeaned, restricted in her movements outside the 
home, and subject to all manner of petty and mean spirited discipline.

'Meanwhile, the Jatia family rigorously 
observed another custom - they made regular and persistent dowry demands,
including requests and demands for cash, jewelry, and lavish gifts.'

The family contacted Rep Steve Israel, who says he is pressuring the Nepal government and will not be satisfied until a full investigation into her death is completed.

He has even threatened to withhold $27 million in aid to Nepal until he’s satisfied a proper probe has taken place.

Father Chander Kochhar said: 'So far, we have lost our daughter and nothing has happened.'

Nuptials: The couple had what was called 'the most extravagant wedding in Nepal' - a three-day ceremony attended by more than 1,000 people at the Hyatt Regency in Nepal

Publicity: Nepali magazine Wedding Bells did a spread on the couple's wedding two years ago

Hanged: Bhoomika was born in India and gained U.S. citizenship as a child. She is a Boston University graduate

They said there are a number of suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of Bhoomika, who gained U.S. citizenship as a child and graduated from Boston University.

When she died, her husband Akaash Jatia took her body to a local hospital but gave false names for both of them.

He then went to another hospital which is controlled by his father, the Kochars told the Daily News.

The Kathmandu Post reported that Nepali police doubted Bhoomika could have hanged herself in the bathroom, because the ceiling was too low.

'Even if she hanged herself by the window pane, her feet would have touched the ground,' an unnamed official told the paper.

Nepali magazine Wedding Bells describes Jatia’s father, Anil, as an executive at Jagdamba Group, a prominent conglomerate in Nepal.

The family have refused to comment on Bhoomika's death. .
