Real Madrid president Florentino Perez was at the club's training ground on Monday for 'crisis talks' with players and coaching staff.

After their shock 4-0 defeat by Atletico in the Madrid derby, Tuesday's Spanish papers are still dealing with the fallout, with Marca and AS leading on Perez's visit to Valdebebas.

Marca report that the Madrid chief spent two hours at the training complex, telling Carlo Ancelotti and his players: 'This is Madrid, millions of people follow us around the world.' 

AS' headline on Tuesday's back page translates as: 'I want you to return to the Madrid you were before'

AS refer to the meeting as a 'crisis cabinet', with Perez saying: 'I want you to return to the Madrid you were before.'

Ancelotti's side were thrashed at the Vicente Calderon on Saturday, with goals from Tiago Mendes, Saul Niguez, Antoine Griezmann and Mario Mandzukic.

To make matters worse in the eyes of supporters, Cristiano Ronaldo was pictured laughing as he hosted his 30th birthday party later that night, leading to supporters brandishing banners reading: 'Your laughter, our shame' outside the training ground.

Despite the result, Real sit top of La Liga, one point ahead of Barcelona and four above Atletico. It seems, though, more is needed from the team to quell the anger of supporters.

In Italy, the big news in Tuesday's papers deals with the future of national team coach Antonio Conte.

There has been much speculation after reports that he was furious at having to cancel a national team get-together when clubs indicated they would not release their players from domestic duties.

But the back pages of the Italian papers indicate that he will stay in charge of the side until Euro 2016. 

Conte will stay in charge of the Italian national team until Euro 2016, Corriere dello Sport report

Corriere dello Sport have the headline 'Conte's Surrender', with a quote from the Italian coach reading: 'Like it or not, I'll remain until Euro 2016.' 

Tuttosport's leading line is much the same, with Conte quoted as saying: 'Like it or not, I will remain until the end of my contract, despite great difficulties, to achieve something unexpected.'

Italian FA president Carlo Tavecchio has also spoken out on the matter, claiming in Tuttosport: 'He is our leader. We are ready to renew, he will honour his deal.'
