She sticks to a tried and tested 
formula which has seen her parade her incredible legs in a series of 
super-short dresses on popular television programme Britain's Got Talent.

But Alesha Dixon took her look in a whole new direction on Friday night as she covered up her pins in a plunging black trouser suit that won her some serious style plaudits.

But beneath her stylish Alexander McQueen ensemble the 34-year-old was hiding a figure-skimming secret.

Hiding a secret: Alesha Dixon donned a £55 shapewear corset underneath her Alexander McQueen suit on Friday's Britain's Got Talent show

Peeking out from underneath, Alesha wore a £55 black bodysuit, which sculpts the stomach and waist with secret surround control panels. 

She may be a slim size 6 to 8, but Alesha proved she is just like us mere mortals when it comes to getting a helping hand from shapewear.

Her stylist Katie Greengrass uses the brand for styling so Scandale ensured she had a full set of the pieces for 'shapewear emergencies' when dressing Alesha for the national TV show, the company told MailOnline.

Alesha donned a piece from the Sirène Collection, which is designed to allow women to 
discover, what they call, their perfect ‘S’ curve silhouette – the ideal shape to define 
and enhance the bust, waist and hip proportions.

The help: She may be a slim size 6-8, but like normal women, Alesha was keen to get a helping hand when it came to looking toned on the national TV show

As well as getting a helping hand from Scandale, Alesha maintains her trim figure by following an '80/20 rule'.

Speaking to the Daily Star, she said: 'I eat more when I'm on tour and cut 
back a bit when I'm training less. It's that age-old thing of striking a 
balance.

'Nutrition is important, but I don't get stuck into fad diets. I
probably have an 80/20 rule - 80 per cent of the time I'm careful and monitor 
my intake, sticking to lean foods and fresh fruit and veg, and the other
20 per cent?

'Well, a little of what you fancy is fine.'

She explained that she works with her trainer twice a week and when she's at home alone, she tries her best to fit in some exercise like sit-ups or squats whilst she's watching TV.

Alesha's favourite French shapewear brand is also a firm favourite of the likes of Made In Chelsea's Binky Felstead, who opted for the brand's swimwear in a recent photoshoot.

After a gruelling week at boot camp, Binky wanted to celebrate losing a stone so donned the sexy shapewear to show off her svelte figure in an OK! magazine photoshoot.

Originally conceived in the 1930s, Scandale has recently made a return to the lingerie market and picked up a celebrity following along the way.
