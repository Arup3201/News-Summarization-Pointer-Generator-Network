In keeping with the best traditions of the Olympic village, a competitor has already revealed she is desperate to find an Olympian lover at Sochi's Games.

When New Zealand snowboarder Rebecca Torr fired up Tinder on her phone she found that few of her fellow athletes had caught on to the 21st century dating tool.

Tinder is a location-based dating app that lets users browse for prospective partners nearby. Users choose yes or no, and if there's a mutual match the app lets them know.

Miss Torr wrote on her Twitter feed: 'It seems so far that not many Olympians use tinder.... Just wanna match with the Jamaican bobsled team.'

The
 Winter Olympics began this weekend in Sochi, on south-west Russia's 
Black Sea coast, with thousands of fit, young and energetic men and 
women arriving from all corners of the world.

The
 winter and summer games provide one of the few occasions in the 
sporting calendar where athletes of all disciplines mingle - and when 
the competition heats up, hormones begin to bubble over.

A
 record 150,000 condoms were handed out during London's Summer Games two
 years ago - 15 each for the duration of the event - and countless tales
 of raunchy post competition liaisons spilled out into the public eye.

Tinder wasn't launched in time for 
London 2012, but its gay equivalent Grindr made headlines after crashing
 almost immediately when athletes began arriving at the Olympic Village 
en masse.

So it's no 
surprise that Miss Torr was looking forward to some off-piste action 
with her fellow athletes in the days leading up to Sochi 2014.

'Can't wait to tinder in the Olympic village in Sochi,' she tweeted last month.

But despite her initial disappointment, Miss Torr's chances of meeting a match online have got a boost after her tweet was picked up by the Olympic Village Daily newspaper which runs for the course of the Games and is handed out to athletes.

'My tinder tweet made the Olympic village daily. Hopefully it brings me more matches and closer to the Jamaicans!' she joked.

And the story, first reported in Business Insider, has a happy ending, for it seems that Miss Torr eventually found what she was looking for.

She tweeted earlier tonight: 'Seriously tinder is on form here in Sochi hahahaha!!'
