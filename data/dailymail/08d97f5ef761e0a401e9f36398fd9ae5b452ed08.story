Only at this World Cup could a goal almost bring down an aircraft.

Only here, in Brazil, could a pilot be ordering his passengers to stop celebrating.

They have been broadcasting matches live on flights these past few weeks and one English reporter informed us how the aircraft he was aboard on Saturday began to ‘wobble’ when David Luiz opened the scoring in this extraordinary encounter. The pilot, said our reporter, was more than a little concerned, barking at them all to sit down.

One only hopes he had landed the plane before Gonzalo Jara’s penalty bounced off a post because if it was anything like the Estadio Mineirao there’s a chance the windows would have blown.

It was astonishing. The ear-splitting 
noise and this sense of nerve-shredding, blessed relief. The sight of 
Luiz Gustavo praying in the centre-circle during those agonising moments
 between the end of extra time and the shoot-out. The sight of Julio 
Cesar in tears before a penalty had even been kicked. 

A
 goalkeeper from Queens Park Rangers but currently on loan at Toronto 
dedicated his man of the match award to ‘the 200million people of 
Brazil’. But those 200million Brazilians are going to need therapy 
before the end of this World Cup.

It
 might have been Luiz Felipe Scolari and his squad who admitted to 
suffering from anxiety attacks. Just as it might have been Thiago Silva 
who said that, were it not for Scolari holding them all together, the 
players would have cracked up already.

But the people Scolari and his players speak of in almost every address they make may not be able to take much more.

From
 the taxi drivers to those fortunate enough to have a match ticket, they
 can’t dare to dream because they remain gripped by a collective fear of
 failure. By the idea that a tournament that has so far exceeded all our
 expectations might just continue without them. That Neymar, their 
darling Neymar, might be reduced to nothing more than a spectator while 
Lionel Messi, heaven forbid, takes centre stage.

Greg
 Dyke was right. When you travel through the host cities before a game 
people do seem to be carrying on with their everyday lives.

But
 when Brazil play the country undergoes a staggering transformation. The
 roads empty, even in Sao Paulo. On one journey from this ground to Belo
 Horizonte’s airport it was like having a private motorway.

For
 those inside this marvellous stadium an outstanding game of football 
dragged them through a full spectrum of emotions. The ecstasy of Luiz’s 
goal; the sense of despair when Hulk made the mistake that enabled the 
brilliant Alexis Sanchez to equalise; never mind the anger at Webb’s 
controversial yet courageous decision to disallow Hulk’s goal and give 
him a yellow card for handball. It certainly blew a rather large hole in
 Chile’s theory about favouritism.

Close call: Chile forward Mauricio Pinilla hit the crossbar in the final minute of extra-time

Nothing, however, compared to deafening noise when Neymar was elevated to the position of match winner.

What
 made it all the more uncomfortable for Brazil for the 120 minutes prior
 to that was the quality of this Chile side. A side that boasts an 
impressive combination of style, sophistication and hard graft.

Extra
 time simply meant another 30 minutes of agony. The terrifying prospect 
of penalties too. On Brazilian television the commentators were said to 
be capturing the mood. They were expressing the view, in the most 
sombre, pessimistic tones, that Chile were growing in stature throughout
 the second half; growing in the belief that the biggest scalp of all 
was here for the taking.

The
 supporters here responded. ‘I believe,’ they cried, as much in 
desperation as anything as the match moved towards the lottery of 
spot-kicks.

When Mauricio Pinilla hit the crossbar, mouths opened and hearts stopped.

When Luiz then ran at the ball like a long jumper and almost burst the net with his shot, the place erupted.

But Willian’s miss, indeed Hulk’s miss, would only add to the agony, ageing a nation by years in a matter of minutes.

‘I
 hope we don’t have any more penalty shoot-outs going forward because I 
fear my friends and family will have heart attacks,’ said Julio Cesar. 
Not to mention 200million others.
