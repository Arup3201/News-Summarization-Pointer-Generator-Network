Lupita Nyong'o is without a doubt Hollywood's most feted star of the year - Kenya's president even described her as 'the pride of Africa' after her Oscar win for Best Supporting Actress in the movie 12 Years A Slave.

And it seems that beauty brands are keen to snap up a piece of the Lupita magic - the actress, who was unveiled as the brand ambassadress of Lancome in April, has debuted her first campaign for the beauty brand and looks positively radiant in the imagery.

The French beauty giant handpicked the 31-year-old and said in a statement at the time: 'Her instinctive and sophisticated talent and one of a kind beauty, both delicate and strength-exuding, has taken the world by storm.'

Speaking about the Mexican-born, 
Kenyan actress, the brand said: 'She is an outstanding example of a 
natural beauty; confident and simply true to herself, she embraces life 
with freshness, citing happiness as the most attractive form of 
radiance.'

Lupita,
 a graduate of the Yale School of Drama, who starred in several 
productions in Kenya before landing her breakout role alongside Brad 
Pitt, said: 'I am truly honored to join the Maison Lancôme, a brand with
 such a prestigious history and that I have always loved.

'I am particularly proud to represent its unique vision for women and the idea that beauty should not be dictated, but should instead be an expression of a woman's freedom to be herself.'

In the July issue of Vogue, she added: 'It’s not about conforming to an 
already established idea of what is beautiful, and I like that.'

Lupita is in good company: Julia Roberts, Kate Winslet, Penélope Cruz and the recently appointed young actress Lily Collins are all Lancome ladies.
