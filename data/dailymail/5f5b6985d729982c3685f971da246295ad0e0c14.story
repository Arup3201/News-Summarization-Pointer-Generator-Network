Samsung has unveiled its latest tablet, claiming it is 'setting the bar higher' with the device - its thinnest and lightest to date.

The Galaxy Tab S, available from next month, features colour-enhancing technology which it claims remains clear and bright even in sunlight and ensures the 'best visual experience anywhere, any time'.

And, for the first time, Galaxy users will be able to make and receive calls directly from their phone to the tablet thanks to a new ‘call forwarding’ feature.

The new Galaxy Tab S 10.5inch tablet available from next month features colour-enhancing technology which it claims remains clear and bright even in sunlight.

The Galaxy Tab S, which comes in two sizes, 10.5-inch and 8.4-inch, and two colours - titanium bronze or dazzling white - also allows consumers to multi-task by surfing the web, watching videos, sharing content and making calls simultaneously without having to close one application to access another.

It will also be available in titanium bronze or

The device lets users multi-task by surfing the web,

without having to close one application to access another.

Industry commentators suggested Samsung was aiming to take on Apple’s iPad at the upper end of the market.

The
 prices - £449 for the 10.5 inch and £349 for the 8.4 inch - are 
actually higher than the iPads, although they offer expandable storage 
up to 128GB.

JK Shin, chief executive of Samsung Electronics’ mobile division, said: ‘With the launch of the Galaxy Tab S, Samsung is setting the industry bar higher for the entire mobile industry.

‘It will provide consumers with a visual and entertainment experience that brings colors to life, beautifully packaged in a sleek and ultra-portable mobile device.’

Samsung called the new gadgets 'personal visual devices'.

To pump up the picture quality, the company brought a wider color range to the screen, and announced HD quality for Netflix and YouTube.

'It portrays the true colors that content creators intended,' said Michael Abary, a senior vice president at Samsung Electronics America.

In the US, both tablets will be available in July, and will cost $399 for the smaller screen and $499 for the larger one.

Apple's iPad (Air pictured) currently dominates the tablet market, but Samsung will be hoping to change that. The Galaxy Tab S comes in two sizes, 10.5-inch and 8.4-inch.

Samsung's tablets, along with nearly two thirds of the tablets on the market, run Google's Android mobile operating system.

However, according to IDC, Apple remains the top tablet vendor in the world with its line of iPads.

Samsung's global tablet market share rose to 22 percent in the first quarter, from 18 percent the year before.

Apple's lead, meanwhile, has dwindled from 40 percent to 33 percent during the same period.

Duncan Bell, operations editor at UK-based gadget magazine T3, said it should be able to compete with the iPad.

He said: ‘After several years of releasing a market-confusing glut of middling-to-good tablets, the S seems to be an attempt by Samsung to say "this time we’ve got it right".

‘The specs leaked so far suggest a device easily able to go toe to toe with the iPad.

'However, Apple’s device is so dominant that the S will also need to be cheaper if it’s to truly compete.’

Jack Parsons, deputy editor at Android Magazine, said: ‘On first glance, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S looks like every other tablet, but at 10.5-inches it’s just a little larger than normal.

'However, it is the first Galaxy tablet to feature a Super AMOLED screen, which on this size canvas offers 288 pixels per inch - surpassing both the iPad Air and Kindle Fire HDX.’

Samsung unveiled their new Galaxy Tab 8.4 inch model (right) and 10.5inch model which aim to rival the iPad Air and Mini

Stuart Miles, founder and chief executive of technology site Pocket Lint, said the new tablet could trigger a change in strategy from Samsung.

‘The rumours surrounding the Samsung Tab S tablets suggest that we should see a range of fantastic flagship Android tablets that are finally able to compete with the iPad Air or iPad Mini on a like-for-like basis,’ he said.

‘Previously, successful Android tablets have been aimed at the mass market entry-level and that has left power users wanting more.

'That move by Samsung is likely to be welcomed by those looking for something powerful and comprehensive rather than just a device designed for surfing on the sofa.’
