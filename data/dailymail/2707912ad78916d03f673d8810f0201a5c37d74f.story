Two classmates and best friends who suffered tragic accidents that left them both paralyzed as young men have shared a unique journey over the past 25 years and today they sit together as directors of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation.

Back in the mid-1980s, Danny Heumann, now 42, and Alan T Brown, now 43, were active young men with their whole lives ahead of them, but within three short years both were facing up to spending the rest of their lives in wheelchairs.

Heumann was paralyzed at 18-years-old
in August 1985 in a car accident. In January 1988, Brown became 
paralyzed, at the age of 20, as a result of a swimming accident.

‘We were 18-years-old, ready to live 
life,’ recalls Brown, 43. ‘I would never think in a class of 70 kids, 
that two kids, two best friends, were going to end up in wheelchairs.’

‘We walked down the aisle together at
our high school graduation. That was probably the last time I saw Danny
walking,' said Brown.

Just two weeks before he was set to begin his freshman year at Syracuse University, Heumann was injured in a car accident while serving as a camp counselor in the Adirondacks, New York state.

‘The driver of the car I was in was speeding around a curb,’ explains Heumann. ‘He was killed, the two others walked away without a scratch, and I broke my back and was paralyzed.’

When Heumann was injured, best friend Brown did all he could do to help his friend. ‘I would take him places, drive him around. Stuff I never thought I would be doing,’ said Brown.

But then Brown himself suffered a cruel twist of fate. Six weeks after he had helped raise $15,000 for his friend's new foundation, he was paralyzed while diving on vacation in Martinique. It was Jan. 2, 1988, little more than two years after Heumann's accident.

On his 21st birthday, Brown underwent surgery to have two metal plates and 11 screws inserted in his C5 and C6 vertebra.

In the years since their life-changing accidents, both men have worked hard and devoted a great of their time to raising funds and awareness about spinal cord injuries, mobility impairment and paralysis.

It hasn't been an easy journey, relationships have been tested and Brown said his own marriage broke up as a consequence. He has two sons, while Heumann is married and has a young daughter.

Both men were determined to lead full lives and not be treated as victims.

'He and I were put in chairs for a 
reason,' says Heumann. 'I don't believe the man upstairs was satisfied 
with our lives on foot. He thought Alan and I had more potential from 
sitting in chairs with a broken neck and broken back.'

Heumann started a charity to raise money for spinal cord research and also works as a motivational speaker for his company Heumannly Capable. He graduated from Syracuse University in 1991 and received his law degree from American University in 1998.

Brown also established a foundation - Alan T Brown Foundation - to support scientific and medical research, he is also founder and owner of PrimeTime Public Relations & Marketing in Hollywood, Florida.

In June 2007, Heumann's Foundation joined the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation. It is named for the actor Christopher Reeve, who was injured in a horseback riding accident and died in 2004. His wife, Dana, worked with him and chaired the foundation; she died in 2006.

Heumann, who now lives in Michigan, also became a member of the Reeve Foundation's Board of Directors.

In October 2009, Brown was elected to the Reeve Foundation Board of Directors focusing on the duel mission of the Foundation, Care and Cure.

'I have pictures of us from before, 
standing together,' says Brown. 'Now, we're sitting together and making a
difference in the SCI world.'

Brown recently pledged to raise $250,000 - $25,000 for each year he has been paralyzed - for the foundation. His one-year campaign is aptly named the 'Power of We.'

'Spinal cord injuries don't discriminate. In one split second my life changed,' said Brown.

An estimated 5.6 million Americans live 
with some form of paralysis, according to Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, and most, like Brown and Heumann, were injured when they were young.
