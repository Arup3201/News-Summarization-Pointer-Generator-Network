When deciding what to wear to hike up a 14,000ft active volcano, a corseted ball gown would be at the bottom of most people's lists.

But this woman settled on that very ensemble for a hike on Washington's Mount Rainier - with the addition of a crown, fairy wings, and elbow length gloves.

Photographs of the trip show the woman holding up the voluminous full-length skirt of her gown as she walks alongside hikers clad in more practical jeans, shorts and fleeces.

High-end hiking: The woman's dramatic full-skirted ballgown against the rocky mountain backdrop was a striking sight

Challenge: The fabric of the flowing gown trailed behind the woman as she made her way up picturesque Mount Rainier, around 50 miles from Seattle

She shared the pictures of her adventure on Reddit, according to the Huffington Post.

The
woman, posting under the user name gesasage88, insisted she had no 
other agenda for the bizarre outing other than 'enjoyment'.

Bizarre: Instead of shorts and hiking boots, this woman made her way up Washington's Mount Rainier in a voluminous ballgown

Walking gear: The ballgown featured a boned corset and was topped off with wings and a crown

'Life isn't always about proving things, sometimes it is just about enjoyment,' she said.

'I had nothing to prove going up the mountain, I had no goal to obtain.'

And while the prospect of embarking on a challenging mountain hike while wearing a corset sounds unappealing, gesasage88 insists she had 'a great time'.

Mount Rainier: A ballgown wouldn't be most people's first choice for making their way up Mount Rainier, which is an active volcano

'Just about enjoyment': A man in more conventional hiking gear points out the route ahead on Mount Rainier in Washington

Shelter: At least the woman's companions, seen peeking out from under her giant ballgown, had a place to take cover if it rained

Dramatic: The woman said she had 'nothing to prove' by hiking up Mount Rainier in the impractical outfit, adding that it was just about 'enjoyment'
