An Alzheimer's sufferer was locked into his onesie by his partner to stop him unzipping the garment

An Alzheimer's sufferer was locked into his onesie by his partner to stop him shredding and eating his incontinence pads, a court has heard.

The woman, in her 50s, allegedly 'fashioned' the all-in-one suit so a padlock could be used to stop the man unzipping the garment for a number of weeks.

The court was told the man, who is in his 80s, had a habit of pulling apart the incontinence pads before eating them at their half-a-million-pound home in Surrey.

When asked by an official about why she had used the lock, the woman said she had dressed him in the onesie 'on medical advice', court was told. 

Judge Lush said the incident was almost identical to another case in which the judge ruled there had not been any deprivation of the person's liberty.

He subsequently ruled that this incident also did not amount to a deprivation of the man's liberty. 

The man, who used to work on the London Underground, had been diagnosed with the illness in 2009, the court was told. 

Details emerged in a ruling by the judge after a hearing in London at the Court of Protection, where issues relating to sick and vulnerable people are analysed. 

Judge Lush had been asked to analyse a legal issue relating to the man's son, who had been given authority to manage his father's financial affairs. 

An official from the Office of the Public Guardian - which protects and helps people who do not have the mental capacity to make decisions - told the judge about the onesie.

She said the approach adopted by the woman - a mother of three - was 'certainly unusual' and had been a 'cause of concern for local authority services'. 

Martina Kane, senior policy officer at Alzheimer’s Society, said new behaviour caused by the condition can be difficult for people to deal with.

She said: ‘Dementia can affect people in very different ways.

'As the condition develops, it can cause behaviour changes that can be confusing or difficult for others to deal with leaving carers feeling stressed or helpless.

'By learning to understand the meaning behind the actions, it can be easier to stay calm and deal effectively with the challenges that arise.'

She said anyone needing advice can call Alzheimer's Society's National Dementia Helpline on 0300 222 11 22.
