A personalised suit worn by India's Prime Minister when he met U.S. President Barack Obama has sold a staggering £450,000 at auction.

Narendra Modi's dark suit with its unique monogram pinstripes, which vertically spell out his name, was sold to diamond merchant Lalji Patel.

The bespoke wool suit sparked a bidding war, but the businessman, who like the Prime Minister is from Gujarat state, made the winning bid of 43 million rupees (£450,000). 

The money will be used to clean up the heavily polluted Ganges River - a pet project of India's Hindu nationalist prime minister.

Modi wore the suit with his monogram in dull gold pinstripes when he met Obama in India last month.

Mr Patel, owner of the Dharmanandan diamond company, said he had wanted to do something for his country.

'Buying this suit was all I wanted,' he said. 'It feels good to know that the money will go towards the cleaning of the holy river.' 

The suit is estimated to have cost more than one million rupees (£10,500), and opposition party lawmakers criticised the Prime Minister for his insensitivity in wearing such an expensive suit in a country where millions live in abject poverty.

However, Gujarat official Milind Toravane said the suit and other items being auctioned were gifts received by Modi after he became Prime Minister in May last year. The gifts include decorative pieces in silver and brass.

The outfit was among more than 450 lots put up for auction by Modi in the city of Surat in Gujarat.

During Modi's 2001 to 2014 stint as chief minister of Gujarat, the gifts he received were regularly auctioned off and the money collected was used to fund programs educating girls in the state.
