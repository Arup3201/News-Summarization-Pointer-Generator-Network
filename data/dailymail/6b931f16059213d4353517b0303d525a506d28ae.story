While most Britons apparently chose to spend today at home nursing hangovers or sheltering from the cold and rainy weather, some particularly hardy souls took a very different approach.

Hundreds of people took to the ocean for a New Year's Day swim, enthusiastically participating in an annual tradition which has become a beloved ritual in many seaside towns.

In the Midlands, Yorkshire, Tyneside and even Scotland, brave revellers dived in to freezing water to see in the year with a bang and raise money for charity.

They persisted in their celebrations even as the country was buffeted by gales and heavy rain, with the stormy conditions of the past week persisting into 2014.

At Cheltenham, racegoers faced a struggle to keep hold of their umbrellas with strong gusts blowing through the venue.

And
 coastal resorts such as Southsea in Hampshire and Brighton in Sussex 
were hit with huge waves which left their beaches and promenades largely
 empty for most of the day.

The New Year's Day parade through Central London was somewhat dampened by the wet weather, while participants in the annual Beaufort Hunt in Gloucestershire wrapped up against the treacherous conditions.

Nonetheless, swimmers in Whitley Bay, North 
Tyneside enthusiastically took part in the annual event held by the 
Panama Swimming Club, with many adopting humorous fancy dress for the 
occasion.

One woman wore a Viking costume as she splashed around in the chilly waves, while a mother and child dressed in Santa outfits.

Some girls even frolicked about wearing nothing but bikinis despite the ice-cold temperatures.

At South Queensferry just outside Edinburgh, more than 1,000 people jumped into the Firth of Forth for the 'Loony Dook'.

A
 fixture in Scotland's calendar for more than 25 years, the Loony Dook 
is part of this year's Edinburgh's Hogmanay celebrations.

It has grown in popularity in recent years, with all 1,100 places sold out this year.

The dook has raised tens of thousands of pounds for charities across the UK, including the South Queensferry lifeboat.

A spokesman for Edinburgh's Hogmanay said: 'It was another great Loony Dook, with lots of extremely colourful fancy dress.

'We had people in their onesies, hula girls, and even a man all wrapped up in bubble wrap - who was probably the least cold.

'We
 even had a marriage proposal. One man popped the question to his 
partner after he'd been in for the dip... and she said yes.'

In Scarborough, Yorkshire, revellers ran along the promenade before leaping into the North Sea at South Bay.

And
 residents of Mapleton in Derbyshire were not deterred by their distance
 from the coast, leaping into the River Dove to celebrate the coming of 
the new year.

Tens of thousands of people apparently poured into the streets of London for a 'swinging sixties' New Year's Day parade.

The event featured cheerleaders, acrobats and a host of musical tribute acts as part of the city's introduction to 2014.

The
 pageant, which has been organised annually since 1987, features more 
than 8,500 performers from across the world, including cheerleaders, 
acrobats and musicians.

Bob Bone, the parade's executive director and founder, said the event started because he 'wanted to cheer up London'.

'Before we started it was really grim here,' he said. 'Shops didn't open much, restaurants were closed, theatres were dark.

'So we thought, let's brighten up London on New Year's Day, and I think we've succeeded.'
