White House Ebola response coordinator Ron Klain may have become an accidental folk hero to fans of crushing bureaucracy everywhere on Wednesday, when a U.S. senator asked high-ranking Obama administration officials to describe his work.

The vague answers sounded like something plucked out of a Dilbert cartoon. 

'Even though the President has named a so-called Ebola “czar” to coordinate our response,' Senate Appropriations Committee ranking Republican Richard Shelby complained, 'all reports indicate that he has no actual authority to direct government agencies here.'

He asked two cabinet secretaries and two other experts what Klain has 'brought to the table' in his role as government-wide coordinator.

Assistant Defense Secretary Michael Lumpkin praised him for 'an excellent job of doing that, just that singular focus on coordinating.'

Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby wanted to know what the Obama White House's 'Ebola czar' has been doing, and witnesses were vague in their answers 

A packed hearing room listened Wednesday to an update on the federal government's plan to fight Ebola, and to justifications for $6.18 billion in new spending

'It's a very important role,' added Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell, 'in terms of when a whole-of-government effort is occurring.'

'And Mr. Klain has stepped into that role and added value to our policy coordination.'

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson insisted that it's critical to have 'somebody who is dedicated full-time in the White House who is doing exactly that.'

All the witnesses said Klain had been in regular touch with them, ranging from 'every single day' to 'countless times,' but no one articulated a specific task he took on or accomplished. 

Klain wasn't present in the room: The White House has kept him away from both Capitol Hill hearings convened since his appointment last month. 

Dilbert, a widely read comic strip by Scott Adams, follows the foibles of a man caught in the cogworks of a big-company bureaucracy.

 Shelby asked Burwell whether Klain has the authority to direct government agencies to do anything, and she replied that his 'coordination' authority stops where government power begins.

'Policy coordination with regard to the execution of the agencies' responsibilities – those sit with me and with the heads of our operating divisions like Dr. Frieden,' she said, referring to the CDC director who has been the administration's public face on Ebola preparedness and epidemiology.

Shelby and other Republicans, though, have complained about a White House that was slow on the uptake when the an Ebola victim first turned up in Texas.

He said Obama's team has 'sent mixed messages on the issue of quarantine,' and 'did not call for enhanced airport screenings for travelers entering the U.S. from West Africa until months after the epidemic became severe.' 

'Not surprisingly,' he said, 'Americans have been frustrated by the lack of clarity and coordination within their government.'

White House Ebola czar Ron Klain emerged from behind the scenes on Tuesday to talk with the Obama administration-friendly MSNBC, but hasn't spoken in congressional hearings

Even though there are no confirmed cases of Ebola in the U.S. right now, Deputy Secretary of State Heather Higginbottom warned that Americans aren't yet out of the woods.

'It is important to realize that epidemic is not yet controlled,' she told senators, 'and that the number of cases will continue to grow.'

Klain privately briefed congressional leaders on Friday at the White House and appeared Tuesday on MSNBC – saying that 'we’re going to see occasional additional cases of Ebola in our country.'

The Senate Appropriations Committee hearing was called to explore the Obama administration's request for $6.18 billion in emergency funding to fight the disease. 

Democratic chairwoman Barbara Mikulski of Maryland, gaveling her last hearing before Republicans take over in January, seemed to be in favor of releasing the money.

'We're working together with the international community to stop the spread of the virus within the three countries,' she noted, 'as well as to contiguous countries and other locations around the world. That is why protecting the United States is essential.' 

'Policy coordination ... sits with me,' said HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell, seeming to confirm that Klain has no authority to take action 

RON KLAIN WHO? Obama's 'Ebola czar' isn't exactly a rousing success, with 40 per cent of Americans saying they've never heard of him and just 10 per cent saying he's doing a good job

Klain, a longtime Democratic Party operative who served a chief of staff to Vice Presidents Al Gore and Joe Biden, has had a rough start in his role.

In a MailOnline/YouGov poll during the last days of October, just 10 per cent of Americans said they approved of his job performance. That's a lower number than the dismal ratings of Congress itself.

Fully 40 per cent of adults surveyed said they had never heard of him. 

Following the October 24 Ebola hearing in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, chairman Rep. Darrell Issa of California said it was understandable that Klain didn't appear since he was getting up to speed.

But 'we do not expect that that would be repeated if there’s a followup hearing,' he cautioned.
