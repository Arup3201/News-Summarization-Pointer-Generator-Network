Brad Jones has vowed to fight for his Liverpool future and use his unexpected return to action to show he can win a new deal.

The Australian goalkeeper is in a similar position to Glen Johnson, Kolo Toure, John Flanagan and Brad Smith in that his current contract expires at the end of the current campaign and talks have yet to start about an extension.

Jones, 32, is in a position, however, where he can influence the club’s thinking, as he has replaced the out-of-form Simon Mignolet in goal and, according to Brendan Rodgers, he will stay there for an “indefinite” period.

Liverpool have conceded six goals in three games since Jones was brought back for an 'indefinite period'

Liverpool have conceded six goals in three games since Jones was drafted back into the first team at Old Trafford and he is aware his performances will be subject to scrutiny but he is determined not to let the pressure impact on him.

‘Indefinite means no timescale,’ said Jones. ‘It is just up to me to go out and do my best and hold on to it for as long as I can. As long as that continues, great. If it is a couple of weeks, a couple of months, we will see. I just have to make the most of it when I can.

‘Everyone wants to link other players with us and that is probably not going to change. We will get linked with another 20 goalkeepers now but I won’t let it affect me. Every game that I play, I will just go out and do my best. Do I want to stay? Of course I do.’

Brendan Rodgers had previously expressed interest in signing free agent Victor Valdes

How Jones plays over the Christmas period will determine whether Rodgers, who had considered bringing former Barcelona No 1 Victor Valdes to Anfield, will press ahead with plans to sign a new keeper in January.

‘There’s pressure on every player in every position,’ Jones said. ‘You are expected to win every week; when you don’t you get criticised. At smaller clubs, you get away with certain things. The magnifying glass isn’t as big, if you like. When you are here, you have to deal with (pressure) as best you can.’

Rodgers has struggled to live up to the expectations from last season where Liverpool finished second

Rodgers replaced Mignolet as he felt a spell out of the team would benefit the Belgian; Jones would not speak about whether Mignolet’s confidence has been shaken but he did argue that the dissection of his performances has been unfair.

‘That is what TV pundits do, isn’t it? They pick holes in people,’ said Jones. ‘They pick holes in teams and point out things. A lot of time, it can be unjustified. Sometimes it is justified. Certain people like to justify their position by jumping on the bandwagon and saying something that gets in the press.

‘It is up to them. That is their job. I have had (criticism) before and I’ll get it again. Simon and I have a very good relationship. We are old enough to know there is nothing petty between players. It is the manager’s decision. We just crack on in training and work as hard as we can.’
