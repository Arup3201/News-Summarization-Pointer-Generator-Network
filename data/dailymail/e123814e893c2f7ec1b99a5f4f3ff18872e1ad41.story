National outrage: Nicholas Prettejohn joined members of the far-right Monday Club in 1980

One of the leading contenders to become the new chairman of the BBC Trust once attended gatherings of a far-Right group who gave Nazi salutes, sang songs glorifying Adolf Hitler and campaigned in favour of ‘racial purity’.

Nicholas Prettejohn, a City grandee who has served as an adviser to George Osborne, is on a shortlist of candidates who are being interviewed for the £110,000 role at the top of the Corporation.

But it has now emerged that when he was a student at Oxford University, Mr Prettejohn attended a meeting of the Monday Club, an offshoot of the Conservative Party that has campaigned for voluntary repatriation of ethnic minorities. 

A photograph unearthed by The Mail on Sunday shows Mr Prettejohn, then a 20-year-old student at Balliol College, at a Monday Club event in 1980 which caused national outrage at the time.

Newspapers reported attendees had shouted ‘Sieg heil’, talked about ‘racial purity’ and sung Tomorrow Belongs To Me, a song performed in the musical Cabaret by members of the Hitler Youth – despite the fact that the event was held close to a memorial to members of the college killed fighting the Nazis. 

James Sainsbury, son of Sir Timothy Sainsbury, a former Conservative Minister, was pictured at the event performing a Nazi salute.

Mr Sainsbury, who was 19 at the time, later apologised, saying he had been ‘very, very drunk indeed’: he received an OBE in 2013 in recognition of his charitable works.

There is no suggestion that Mr Prettejohn engaged in or condoned the chanting and saluting.

Eight months before the dinner, Mr Prettejohn had been elected president of the famous Oxford Union debating society – with his political opponents claiming he had been swept to victory by a ‘Monday Club machine’ which mobilised Right-wing supporters. 

The Conservative Party severed its ties with the Monday Club in 2001, when then leader Iain Duncan Smith warned the group that its racist policies were damaging public perception of the party.

The race to succeed Lord Patten as BBC Trust chairman was blown wide open last month after the favourite, Lord Coe, unexpectedly pulled out of the running.

Mr Prettejohn, 54, who was recently appointed chairman of pensions and investment firm Scottish Widows, became one of a group of City advisers to Mr Osborne after the 2010 General Election. 

He became a BBC trustee last December.

Shortlist: Mr Prettejohn, 54, became a BBC trustee last year and is now on a shortlist for the £110,000 job

The Chancellor is understood to have been heavily involved in the recruitment process for the Trust chairman, and called for the shortlist to feature candidates with strong City experience.

Other potential contenders include Tory peer Patience Wheatcroft, a former Times journalist, and Suzanna Taverne, a BBC trustee and former senior manager at the British Museum.

Government sources say that although Mr Prettejohn is a ‘strong candidate’, No 10 is keen for the successful candidate to be a woman.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Nick is on holiday at the moment and is not available to comment.’
