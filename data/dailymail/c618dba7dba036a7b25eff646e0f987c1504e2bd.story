Petra Kvitova won a thrilling match against Angelique Kerber to earn the Czech Republic their third Fed Cup title in four years in Prague.

Straight-sets victories for Kvitova and Lucie Safarova over their German opponents on Saturday left the Wimbledon champion knowing a repeat in the opening match on Sunday would be enough.

There was nothing straightforward about this one but after two hours and 57 minutes Kvitova prevailed 7-6 (7/5) 4-6 6-4 to reclaim the title the Czechs won in 2011 and 2012.

Having pulled back from 2-5 to win the opening set, Kvitova also trailed in the decider but won six of the last seven games before clinching victory on her fourth match point.

It was an up-and-down contest throughout, and Kerber fought hard to stay in the match having been 3-0 down in the second, but ultimately to no avail.

Kvitova told fedcup.com: 'It was an amazing match from both of us. It was a very big fight. Angie played so well and I'm just glad that I did it.'

Asked how the achievement compared to her Wimbledon final hammering of Eugenie Bouchard, the 24-year-old added: 'This is on the highest spot for sure.

'I never had these emotions this year. Wimbledon was totally different, I was playing so well. Here it was really up and down and it was really difficult to be positive.'
