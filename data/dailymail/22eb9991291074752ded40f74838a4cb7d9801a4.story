Teachers allowed two young sisters to get so badly sunburned that they needed hospital treatment because of a little-known law that bans students from applying sunscreen at school.

Fair-skinned Violet Michener, 11, and her nine-year-old sister Zoe were left seared from head to toe after spending an afternoon in the sun during an outdoor field day in Tacoma Washington.

Their mother, Jesse Michener, who didn't put cream on the girls in the morning because of a rain forecast, was horrified to learn that teachers refused to allow the children 
to apply any cream.

Burned: Sisters Violet, 11, (left) and Zoe, 9, (right) received sunburns strong enough to bring them to a hospital for blisters and chills after a school field day prohibited their use of sunscreen due to school policy

Public schools in all states except California are not allowed to apply or carry the product to school because - despite being freely available in supermarkets - it is deemed a prescription medication.

Yet the girls say they were 
forced to watch one teacher put on her own sunscreen and then explain to
 the burning students that it was  'just for
 her' when they begged her for some.

'While I can sort of wrap my brain
 around this in theory, the practice of a blanket policy which clearly 
allows for students to be put in harm’s way is deeply flawed,' Mrs 
Michener wrote in a blog post.

Making
 matters worse, the mother claims that one of her daughters has a form of 
Albinism - a skin condition that leads to easy burning - that her school was aware of.

Prescription: Sunscreen, like this product shown, is considered an over-the-counter medication and not allowed in most schools across the country without a prescription

'Violet is 
starting to blister on her face. Both children have headaches, chills 
and pain,' Mrs Michener wrote last Wednesday after taking the children to Tacoma General 
hospital.

'Two are home today as a direct result of how terrible they 
feel. My children indicated that several adults commented on their burns at school, including staff and other parents.'

For liability reasons, most states consider sunscreen as an over-the-counter medication requiring a prescription.

'Because so many additives in lotions and sunscreens cause an allergic reaction in some children, we have to really monitor that,' said Dan Voelpel, a Tacoma school district spokesman speaking to ABC.

Since raising awareness in her area of the SPF policy, Mrs Michener began to see some success late last week.

Receiving a call from the director of Elementary Education in Tacoma Public Schools last Thursday according to her blog, the director informed her of a new law passed allowing districts to decide for themselves what's allowed and what's not.

'He stated that how the law will actually shake-out for districts is still to be seen (the devil is always in the details), but that he hoped a policy revision could be achieved by October,' the mother wrote.

Asked by the Huffington Post on Friday the condition of the two girls, the mother replied: ‘They will heal this week, but long term effects are yet to be seen.’
