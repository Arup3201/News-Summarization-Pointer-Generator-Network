An 18-month-old child is dead after being mauled by two family dogs at a home in Florida on Monday morning.

Declin Moss was playing on the front porch at the home in Brookville when for unknown reasons two of the family's four dogs attacked him.

The toddler's mother Shelia wasn't at home at the time of the attack and the child was being watched by his grandfather, 51-year-old Gregory Moss. 

Declin Moss, pictured with his mom Shelia, was playing on the front porch at the home in Brookville, Florida, when for unknown reasons the two 'mixed breed' dogs attacked him as his grandfather looked on

The attack happened at around 11 a.m. When authorities arrived at the home after receiving a call about a boy being bitten by a dog, they found the toddler dead from his injuries.

Investigators have described the two animals - named Thumper and Max - as 'mixed breed,' but are awaiting confirmation from a vet to determine their breed types. Neighbors described the dogs as pit bulls.

'It's sad. It's definitely something you don't want to deal with, especially with a young child like that, just 18 months,' Michael Terry, a spokesman for the Hernando County Sheriff's Office, told the Tampa Bay Times.

Declin had lived at the home with his mom and grandfather who witnessed the incident and had attempted to save his young grandson. 

Local police had not previously received complaints regarding the dogs and the family are said to be shocked at the dogs' uncharacteristic aggressiveness

'Our technicians are out here interviewing the grandfather and trying to get the details from him, but he's obviously pretty shaken up,' said Terry.

Local police had not previously received complaints regarding the dogs and Terry said the family were shocked at the two animals' uncharacteristic aggressiveness.

Deputies were continuing to investigate at the home at 16251 Cherokee Road on Monday afternoon and Terry said 'it's too early to tell' if charges will be filed. 

The family own four dogs, the two involved in the terrible incident have been removed by Animal Control.
