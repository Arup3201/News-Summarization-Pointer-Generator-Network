The NHS has spent £1.4 billion on redundancy packages for staff in the last three years with some receiving packages of more than £600,000, figures show.

Some 2,299 bureacrats have been handed six-figure golden goodbyes since 2010 after their posts were axed under the Government’s health reforms.

Yet as many as a fifth have already walked in to new jobs within the health service and thousands more are expected to follow over the coming months.

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham says 'the true cost of David Cameron's NHS re-organisation is slowly revealing itself' after figures showed £1.4billion has been spent on staff redundancies in the past three years

Labour’s shadow health secretary Andy Burnham accused the Government of ‘siphoning’ billions away from front line care to fund the lavish exit packages of executives.

NHS staff typically receive one month’s pay for every year served although senior managers can usually negotiate far more lucrative exit packages.

The highest is believed to have been awarded to Nicholas Hicks, the former director of health at the now defunct Milton Keynes Primary Care Trust, who received around £600,000 when his post was abolished in April.

Under NHS rule, staff can be rehired and still take their redundancy package as long as they do not start their new job for one month.

It is not known whether Mr Hicks has since been re-employed within the health service.

The Government’s health reforms officially came into force in April and saw hundreds of Primary Care Trusts and Strategic Health Trusts abolished and replaced by GP-led organisations called

Andy Burnham said: ‘The true cost of David Cameron’s NHS re-organisation is slowly revealing itself.

‘At a time when the NHS needs every penny it can get, we have a Prime Minister handing out gold-plated, six-figure pay-offs to thousands of managers and P45s to thousands of nurses.

‘Billions have been siphoned out of the NHS front-line to pay for an unnecessary re-organisation no-one voted for and David Cameron personally promised would not happen. It is a colossal waste of money.

‘The money he has wasted on pay-outs for managers could instead have prevented the thousands of nurse redundancies we have seen on this Prime Minister’s watch. It will be galling for any nurses who have lost their jobs to see the sickening scale of these pay-outs.’

Only last week NHS figures showed that almost 5,000 nursing posts have been axed since the Coalition came to power in April 2010.

Although the health service’s budget has been ring-fenced, hospitals and health trusts have been ordered by Whitehall to save billions from their budgets and many have resorted to shedding front line posts.

Matthew Sinclair of the Taxpayers Alliance was quick to slam the new figures

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the Taxpayer’s Alliance, said: ‘There is a severe danger that golden goodbyes for senior staff in the health service could undermine any savings the Government reforms could bring.

‘If there wasn’t a ring fence around health spending then may be NHS executives wouldn’t be so cavalier with their budgets by awarding such lavish payoffs.’

Figures obtained by Labour from the Department of Health’s annual accounts show that more than 32,000 managers have received redundancies totalling £1.4 billion.

They included 330 pay-offs of more than £200,000, 513 of between £150,000 and £200,000 and 1456 of between £100,000 and £150,000.

But in July a report by the National Audit Office pointed out that a fifth of the staff made redundant had already found new jobs within the health service.

And with around 4,500 posts in the newly-created bodies still to be filled, many more are expected to follow suit.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Last year we started changes that put doctors and nurses in the driving seat as they are best placed to take decisions about care for their patients.

‘The changes made as a result of the reforms mean a huge net gain for the taxpayer. They will save £5.5 billion during this Parliament and £1.5 billion every year thereafter, to be reinvested back into patient care.’
