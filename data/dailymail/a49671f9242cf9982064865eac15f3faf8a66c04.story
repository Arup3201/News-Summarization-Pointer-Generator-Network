Freed: Lola Olayemi admitted causing death by careless driving

A woman driver who killed a mother and left her son fighting for his life after slamming into a bus shelter walked free from court today.

Lola Olayemi, 35, had pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving after the smash in Caversham, Berkshire, which killed Catriona Scott, a single mother.

The court heard how Olayemi, from nearby Reading, had gone on a shoplifting spree the day she had been charged over the crash, which also left Miss Scott's son in a critical condition.

Miss Scott was crushed to death when the bus shelter where she had been waiting with her then nine-year-old son, Miles collapsed on top of them both.

Both mother and son were rushed to hospital, but she died just two days after the crash, which was caused when Olayemi smashed her 4x4 into one of the shelter's supporting pillars.

Miles suffered a fractured skull in the incident and was left deeply traumatised by the tragedy.

A judge sitting at Reading Crown Court heard how Olayemi made no attempt to prevent the tragic collision, despite her own baby daughter, then aged 21 months, travelling in the car with her.

Jane Davies, prosecuting, told the court that witnesses standing at the bus stop saw Olayemi's Toyota Rav 4 turn a corner but fail to straighten out. Her car hit a bollard as it mounted the pavement before crashing into the shelter, demolishing it.

Fellow passengers waiting for their buses were left covered in glass as the shelter collapsed on top of Miss Scott. 'Catriona Scott was lying on her front. She was being helped by another passenger and her son Miles was also injured and was crouching close by,' said Ms Davies.

'The defendant got out of her car and was shouting "what shall I do?"'

Olayemi had tried to help stricken Miss Scott before paramedics arrived at the scene of the crash in Briants Avenue, Caversham, at around 1.30pm on February 28.

Both Miss Scott and Miles were treated at as specialist head injuries unit at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, where Miss Scott later died.

In a witness impact statement read to the court, Miss Scott's 71-year-old father, George, said that her loss had left a 'black hole' in his life.

He had become the full-time carer for the boy and had moved into his daughter's home to ensure that the youngster's life remained as unchanged as possible.

Despite the schoolboy making a full physical recovery the court was told that he required counselling sessions to help him come to terms with his mother's death.

'I have no life now, my life centres around my grandson and trying to ensure that he can get over his problems as soon as possible,' said Mr Scott, a widower.

The court was told how Olayemi had not been speeding at the time of the crash, nor was she under the influence of drink and drugs while both of her mobile phones were inside a bag in the back of the car.

Olayemi, who had only held a UK driving licence for a year despite driving for 10 years in her native Nigeria, told police that she had been trying to avoid another car - although witnesses said they had not seen it.

She admitted causing death by careless driving at an earlier appearance in Reading Magistrates' Court.

She also admitted to stealing Â£300 pounds worth of clothes from Debenhams just one hour after being charged with causing Miss Scott's death on July 28.

Judge John told Olayemi, who had previous convictions for theft but not for driving offences, that were he to give her a prison sentence she would only have ended up serving around six weeks.

'In my judgement that would serve no justice whatsoever and would lead Miss Scott's family to wrongly believe that six weeks inside was the price I was putting on her life,' he said.

The judge instead sentenced Olayemi to a 12-month community order and told her she would have to undertake 240 hours of unpaid work - with a further 60 hours for the shoplifting offence.
