At around 337kg, he is Australia's heaviest man. But Ulu Tuipulotu, 26, who 'pumps a whole loaf of bread' for breakfast and is addicted to a popular video game, wants to change his life.

The western Sydney man, who gorges himself with food while playing the first person shooter Call of Duty on his couch for as long as 12 hours a day, is determined to see his next birthday and be at the future weddings of his nieces and nephews.

'I want to be there, bro,' said Mr Tuipulotu, whose diet includes wolfing down a whole chicken for lunch. 

He has gone public with his weight loss struggle after signing up to a two-year sponsored psychological and physiological program ran by a Sydney hypnotherapist.

Doctors have bluntly warned Mr Tuipulotu he will die if he cannot lose weight. But it's not going to be easy. He has attempted diets, such as Lite 'N' Easy packaged food plans. He's tried Optifast, a milkshake weight loss plan, as well as going to the gym. Nothing has worked so far.

Fighting for life: Ulu Tuipulotu, 26, is determined to see his nieces and nephews get married one day

On the scales: Mr Tuipulotu today went public with his fight for life. He has lost fifteen kilos since starting a program of physical activity and hypnotherapy

Instead the unemployed man, who lives with his Tongan family in Quaker's Hill, plays online games for most of the day and touts himself as one of the best Call of Duty players in the world. 'Like a boss,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

In his own words, Mr Tuipulotu has always been 'big'. He was born weighing 12.5 pounds and, at age 5, weighed 60kg. 

But it did not become a problem until his weight began to balloon around age 13. Now he is around four times the weight of the average Australian male, which is 85.9kg. 

His family also struggle with their weight. His mother Sue checks in at 180kg, his dad Sale weighs 130kg and sister Nine tops 120kg. 

'We just love food as a people,' Mr Tuipulotu told Daily Mail Australia. 'I'm speaking Pacific Islanders in general. Me, I just took it to the extreme'.'  

Mr Tuipulotu's downfall was non-stop snacking on cheeses, biscuits and packets of Arnotts Shapes

But it was his family who convinced him it was time to try something drastic. 

Sydney hypnotherapist Mark Stephens, who has worked with extremely obese patients in the past, has committed Mr Tuipulotu to a two-year program involving hypnotherapy and multiple sessions a week with personal trainers.

Mr Stephens told Daily Mail Australia his client had tried just about everything before his mother, Sue, watched a program about the success another morbidly obese man, Jordan Tirekidis, had with hypnotherapy on the Nine Network's A Current Affair program. Mr Tirekidis lost 200kg. 

'(My family) are really pushing to go hard on it (his weight loss program),' Mr Tuipulotu said. 'So I've got to do it, hey?'

BREAKFAST: 

'I  pump down a whole loaf of bread, toasted, and Milo (a chocolate drink)

LUNCH:

'Probably a whole chicken, like a boss.'

DINNER:

'Yeah whatever, takeaway' - including KFC, Hungry Jacks or McDonald's

SNACKS:  

Chips, drinks, donuts, Arnott's Shapes, biscuits and cheese

Mr Tuipulotu and his family began the program around four weeks ago after meeting with Mr Stephens. 

Mr Stephens said: 'With hypnosis, the worst thing that can happen is nothing. The best thing is you can change your life.

Dietitian Dr Joanna McMillan said the reasons why Mr Tuipulotu is overweight are apparent in his unhealthy diet, which included constant snacking on cheese, biscuits and Arnott's Shapes while playing games.

'It's not hard to see why he was so overweight when he has that kind of a diet,' she said. But he could make drastic changes by just making small changes to his diet each week. 

'Let's just focus on three meals and two snacks and don't eat in between,' she said. 'Cutting down on that amount of bread. Introducing vegetables.'

Dr McMillan said the psychological side of weight loss is often forgotten. 

'I often think the mind connection is what is given a bit of lip service to in any weight loss program.'

'Whether hypnotherapy, or seeing a counsellor or a hypnotherapy or a counsellor or a psychiatrist each of these people have their own approaches. 

'People have to find what works for them.'

Sydney GP Dr Brian Morton said hypnotherapy should be used as part of a program involving proper diet and exercise.

He said he had seen it work as part of a program for smokers trying to quit. For others, it was 'useless'. 'It's not going to be magic,' Dr Morton said. 

Mr Tuipulotu is pledging to plough ahead, having lost 15 kilos over the space of a month. 

He said he is already beginning to feel the benefits of a healthier lifestyle, including more energy when he walks around. 

'I can feel lots of changes,' he told Daily Mail Australia. And he warned others not to follow his lifestyle. 

'Look at me, man,' he said. 'You don't want to be here.'
