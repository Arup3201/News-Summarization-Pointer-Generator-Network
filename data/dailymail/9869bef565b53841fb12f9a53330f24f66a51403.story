It is rapidly turning into the summer that never was.

After the wettest June on record, another deluge is on the way, with at least a month's worth of rain set to fall today and tomorrow across much of Britain.

The Met Office last night issued a severe weather warning, predicting 'heavy thundery downpours' and up to four inches of rain by the weekend – more than the average for the whole of July.

Despite the sight of some blue sky wet weather delayed the start of the One Day International between England and Australia at Edgbaston today

Rollers were used to try and drain the water from the field of play, but there were still heavy puddles in the outfield for the match at Edgbaston

Well if you're going to get wet anyway... One sport that won't be stopped by the rain is surfing. This picture shows the grey skies along the shoreline at St Agnes, Cornwall

Yet despite the seemingly endless wet weather, four water companies still have a hosepipe ban in force, brought in at the start of April.

South East Water said restrictions would stay in place until autumn at least, while Sutton and East Surrey Water, Veolia Central and Veolia Southeast are also clinging on, saying underwater aquifers are still not fully recharged.

The drought declared at the start of the year now seems a distant memory.

Northern and eastern England and Scotland will see the worst of the rain today, but it is set to extend to central and southern areas tomorrow, threatening men's semi-final day at Wimbledon.

The wet weather will continue in northern England on Saturday, but Sunday should be much drier.

The Met Office and Environment Agency warned of more surface and river flooding, giving no respite to the families in risk areas already hit by last month's downpours.

Temperatures over the next few days will hover around the average, reaching highs of 23C (73F) during the day.

Heavy rain started falling again yesterday afternoon and there will be patchy downpours today, but tomorrow is set to see the worst of it, with torrential rain and some storms.

It has been the wettest April-to-June period on record. Wales and northern England have suffered from flooding, while the downpours have affected summer events including the Diamond Jubilee, Henley Regatta and Wimbledon.

In Wiltshire, strawberry farmers say their crop is in danger of rotting in waterlogged fields, and they hope to sell most of their stock as early as mid-July.

Warnings: The Met Office has issued warnings for
much of Britain, including London, East Anglia, Devon and Cornwall, the
north of England and Scotland, while on Friday,  the north east 
especially should be prepared

Forecasters have blamed movements of the jet stream – the high altitude wind which sweeps from west to east – for the unseasonable weather.

They say it has become 'blocked' by high pressure, causing a long-running heatwave on the east coast of America and non-stop rain and wind this side of the Atlantic.

The average rainfall during a normal July is 70mm, nearly three inches. Up to 100mm – almost four inches – is set to fall today and tomorrow.

Met Office chief forecaster Martin Young said: 'We are expecting outbreaks of heavy rain across a wide area of the UK, with worst affected spots likely to be in central and northern parts of the country.

'This is likely to lead to surface water flooding. The public should be prepared for disruption to travel and outdoor activities.'

But he added the rain would be patchy, with some areas seeing none at all. A good proportion of the country may also have some sunshine today.

An Environment Agency spokesman said: 'Heavy rain on Friday and Saturday may lead to significant flooding of properties across parts of northern England.

'We urge people to remain vigilant and prepared for flooding by checking the Environment Agency website and signing up for localised river flood warnings.'

Last month was the wettest June since records began in 1910. Provisional Met Office figures showed the UK had 145.3mm (5¾ inches), beating the previous record of 136.2mm (5¼ inches) in June 2007.

If the weeks of torrential rain were not 
bad enough, homeowners have a new problem to contend with - rats.

Experts
say scores of rat communities have been displaced by the recent flash 
floods and they are looking for shelter - in your home.

The
water-deluged drains and sewers of the past few weeks have mobilised 
rat populations previously living underground, driving them above the 
flood waters and in some cases through cracked drains and into homes, according to drainage specialists Drain Claim.

The
insurance handling company believes the nation’s booming rat population –
currently at 80 million – will continue to rise.

The
combination of flash flooding, an ageing sewer system, councils cutting
back on services including pest control and weekly bin collections and 
insurers failing to adequately repair damaged drains, is creating the 
perfect breeding ground for rats in residential areas.

David Hayes, CEO of Drain Claim, 
said: 'One of the biggest issues we are 
currently seeing is rats who have been moved around by the flood waters 
finding their way through cracked pipe work and into properties.

'Home owners in the South East, Midlands and North East have 
already reported a surge in rat problems and unfortunately this is 
likely to continue as the flood waters subside.'

Resilient rats are capable of swimming up to 
half a mile, even against the current, in a sewer pipe.

And young rodents can squeeze through holes 
as small as one centimetre wide and capable of creating significant damage by 
chewing through pipe work and building materials.

Rats are also extremely difficult to eradicate once
they have established a nest, with females capable of producing 
litters of up to 10, 10 times a year.

Mr Hayes added: 'Once rats enter a 
home, because of the serious health risks that they pose, the only 
course of action is trapping or poisoning which runs the risk of 
decaying and infected bodies being trapped within the fabric of a 
property.

'It is far better to address the 
problem outside of the property by preventing rats from establishing a 
location within the sewage system and working their way into the home.

'I would urge property owners 
affected by the recent floods, even if they haven’t noticed any visible 
sign of rats, to get their drains checked and ensure they have adequate 
protection for their drainage systems through their buildings insurance 
policy’s accidental damage clauses.'
