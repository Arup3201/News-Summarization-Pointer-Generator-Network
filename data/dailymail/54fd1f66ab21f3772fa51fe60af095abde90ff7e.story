Former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez smirked in court today as he was indicted on a first-degree murder charge in the death of a friend whose bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial park about a mile from the ex-player's home.

The six-count grand jury indictment charges Hernandez with killing 27-year-old Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player from Boston who was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend.

Prosecutors claim that Hernandez, 23, orchestrated 
Lloyd's killing because he was upset at him for talking to people 
Hernandez had problems with at a nightclub days earlier.

Hernandez and two other men, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, allegedly picked Lloyd up at his home
in Dorchester early on June 17 and then drove to 
the industrial park. The body was found by a jogger later that day.

Charges: Aaron Hernandez, pictured smiling at his hearing today, has been indicted on a first-degree murder charge in the death of a semi-pro football player, Odin Lloyd, whose body was found near his home

In court: Hernandez, pictured in Attleboro, Massachusetts today, faces life behind bars if convicted

Nonchalant: Hernandez, 23, looked relaxed as he appeared in court, two months after his arrest

Hernandez, who was dropped by the 
Patriots within hours of his arrest on June 26, could face life in 
prison without parole if convicted.

Hernandez appeared briefly in Attleboro District Court on Thursday for a previously scheduled probable-cause hearing and looked relaxed.

Victim: The body of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd was found on June 17 about a mile from Hernandez's home

At one point he even mouthed the words 'I love you' to someone in the courtroom, the Boston Herald reported.

The indictment also contains weapons counts, according to the Fall River division of Bristol County Superior Court.

Hernandez
pleaded not guilty to murder and weapons charges in June, and he is 
being held without bail at a county jail. His lawyers say the case 
against him is circumstantial and they're confident he will be able to 
clear his name.

Shortly before Lloyd's death, authorities say, Lloyd sent his sister text messages. He asked if she had seen who he was with when he got into the car in Boston.

Then he indicated who it was in a way that Lloyd's family said he knew his sister would understand. 'NFL,' he wrote. 'Just so you know.'

Moments later, authorities say, Lloyd was dead after gunshots rang out in an unpaved construction area by a warehouse after he apparently got out of the car for what he thought was a bathroom break.

Authorities have not said who fired the shots, but according to court documents, Ortiz told police in Florida that Wallace said it was Hernandez.

Supporters: People shout support for Hernandez as he returns to the van after the probable-cause hearing

Loss: A woman wears a button with a picture of Odin Lloyd as she listens during the court proceedings

Wallace has pleaded not guilty to a charge of accessory to murder after the fact. Ortiz has pleaded not guilty to a firearm charge. Both are being held in jail without bail.

Authorities have said they haven't found the murder weapon, which they believe was a .45-caliber Glock pistol, but warrants released earlier this month suggested Hernandez may have asked his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, to dispose of it.

Investigators did recover a magazine for .45-caliber bullets in Hernandez's Hummer as well as ammunition of the same caliber inside a condo he rented in Franklin, Massachusetts.

Authorities also recovered a shell casing
that matched those found at the homicide scene after tracking the 
rental car Hernandez was in the night Lloyd died.

Since then, Boston police have asked 
police in Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut for their help 
with the probe into Lloyd's homicide as well as a 2012 double homicide 
near a Boston nightclub.

Questions: Warrants earlier this month claimed that Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancee (pictured in court earlier this month), may have helped him dispose of the weapon that killed Odin

Allegations:

Connecticut in June. He faces a gun charge but has told authorities 
that Hernandez confessed to the murder

A 
Connecticut police lieutenant said authorities searched the home of 
Hernandez's uncle, seizing an SUV sought in the double killing that had 
been rented in Hernandez's name.

Two
men died in the July 2012 shooting in Boston's South End, with 
witnesses reporting that gunfire came from inside a gray SUV with Rhode 
Island tags.

Boston police 
haven't reported any arrests in the deaths of Daniel Jorge Correia de 
Abreu, 29, and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, 28, and won't comment on whether
Hernandez is a suspect.

Hernandez is also facing civil litigation after a Connecticut man filed a lawsuit asserting the former player shot him in the face in February after they argued at a Miami strip club.

Alexander Bradley, who says he lost an eye, told police at the time he didn't know who shot him.

In July, a judge ordered him to appear before the Fall River, Massachusetts, grand jury hearing evidence against Hernandez in Lloyd's homicide.
