Forget complex talks over tax, trade and conflict.

The really tricky issue to negotiate for the modern politician is what a 'smart casual' dress code at a global summit means.

Chancellor George Osborne today revealed the strict instructions issued to attendees of the G8 summit at the five star Lough Erne resort in Enniskillen - and boasted that he had followed it to the letter.

Casual: Chancellor George Osborne revealed the instructions he had been given - to wear a jacket, blue shirt and no tie - to attend the G8 summit

David Cameron set the tone yesterday 
as he ditched a tie and jacket to wear an open neck blue shirt, with 
sleeves rolled up to greet some of the most powerful men (and one woman)
 in the world.

All of the leaders appeared tieless 
at the resort, despite Mr Cameron and US President Barack Obama wearing a
 tie to visit a school earlier in the day.

Now Mr Osborne has revealed the instructions given to those attending the conference, which brings together leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, 
Japan, Russia, USA and the UK.

He said: 'I did what I was told to do
 which was turn up in what they call smart casual wear – I followed to 
the letter, I got out my jacket and my blue shirt.

'The interesting thing about this 
conference – I’ve never been to a G8 before, I’m here to present one of 
the sessions on tax – is it is informal.

'Despite the enormous fuss that goes 
with having a conference like this, despite the huge media presence, 
actually when you get into the hotel it’s quite intimate and informal,' 
he told Sky News.

'And getting these world leaders 
together to talk about difficult issues on tax and trade, including of 
course last night about Syria, this is actually an extraordinary 
opportunity to get things done where perhaps when things are more 
formal, people are in more entrenched positions, that’s more difficult.'

President Obama has recently  announced he is ready to start supplying weapons to Syrian rebels. It is believed the conflict will dominate the G8 agenda

The ongoing conflict in Syria continues to dominate the agenda, alongside scheduled discussions on trade, tax and transparency.

It comes after President Obama has announced he is ready to start supplying weapons to the rebels.

Despite the warm greeting, it is said
 that Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived at the G8 in Northern 
Ireland tonight with relations with summit host Cameron at a new low.

The
 two men clashed ahead of the two-day conference as Britain looks to be 
leaning towards joining the United States in backing giving arms to 
rebels in Syria.

Mr Putin's opposition to the danger 
of weapons being sent to extremist groups has however been backed by 
London Mayor Boris Johnson, who warned the plan risked putting guns into
 the hands of 'Al Qaeda-affiliated thugs'.

The charm offensive was in full force as he greeted German Chancellor Angela Merkel with a kiss

US President Barack Obama, who visited a school in Enniskillen with Mr Cameron yesterday, is ready to arm the opposition in Syria.

But Mr Putin used a fraught press conference in Downing Street on Sunday to warn the rebels ‘eat the organs’ of their enemies.

Mr
 Johnson put himself at odds with the Prime Minister, warning Britain 
would not be able prevent weapons from falling into the hands of 
terrorists.

The two-day 
summit will see the Lough Erne resort in Enniskillen host Mr Obama, Mr 
Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois 
Hollande, Canadian premier Stephen Harper, Italian Prime Minister Enrico
 Letta and Japan’s Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.

Mr
 Cameron wants to make progress on a free trade deal between Europe and 
the US which he believes could ‘turbo-charge the transatlantic economy’.

The leaders feasted on local Northern Irish delicacies at the summit this evening.

The eight G8 prime ministers and presidents were joined by European Commission and Council presidents Jose Manuel Barroso and Herman van Rompuy for the intimate meal at the end of the first day of the summit.

The 10 statesmen were alone in the room without advisers, in order to create an atmosphere to meet Mr Cameron's hope for 'a meeting where we can look each other in the eye, cut through the obstacles and the opposition and generate the political will to solve the problems we face'.

The working dinner, which focused on foreign affairs issues including Syria and Libya, took place in a waterside lodge at the luxury Lough Erne golfing resort near Enniskillen, where the two-day summit is being staged.

The room features a traditional Irish hotel bar and fireside seats to encourage the leaders to linger for a chat over a glass of whiskey or a pint of Guinness.

The menu for the meal included freshly caught Kilkeel crab, prawn and avocado salad, a roast fillet and braised shin of Kettyle beef, with artichokes and Antrim new potatoes.

The meal was rounded off with an apple crumble with Bushmills whiskey custard.
