A mother-of-three who suffers with a condition that causes her muscles to pulsate, swell and stiffen like that of the Incredible Hulk has left doctors baffled.

Helen Stephens, 50, from Wednesbury in the West Midlands, has suffered with a debilitating yet undiagnosable condition for the past 14 years and has been left bedbound and unable to look after herself.

Her condition - which she likens to having red hot pokers placed under her skin -  has worsened in recent months and she is frightened that one day the spasms will become so violent that they will kill her.

Helen Stephens, 50, suffers with an undiagnosable condition that causes her muscles to spasm, stiffen and swell. She has deteriorated in recent months, with chest pain causing her worry that that condition may kill her if she does not receive appropriate treatment soon

She has already started to develop chest pains when she suffers a flare-up and she is worried that she will be left unable to breathe or have a heart attack.  

Ms Stephens is the subject of a Channel 5 documentary which follows her journey to get a definitive diagnosis.

Until she is formally diagnosed, doctors are unable to treat the root cause of her frightening condition.

For years doctors believed she 
suffered with a very rare condition called Stiff Person Syndrome, but 
tests have been unable to confirm this.

Agony: In the Channel 5 documentary, Ms Stephens undergoes rigorous testing. Doctors originally believed she has Stiff person Syndrome, but test results have all come back negative

Last year Ms Stephen's spasms caused her muscles to build up and swell so much that she put on five stone and her neck swelled by four inches. She said that one of the things she hates the most about the condition is the lack of control she has over her life

But recently a more sensitive 
test, which can pick up even trace amounts 
of the the antibodies responsible for the condition, has become available.

In the documentary, Ms Stephens 
visits consultants at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham as well experts at 
the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford to undergo eight days of rigorous 
testing.

Last year Ms 
Stephen's spasms caused her muscles to build up and swell so much that 
she put on five stone and her neck swelled by four inches.

Before developing the mystery condition, Ms Stephens had a succesful career as a social worker and was a busy mother-of-three. Since 1999 however she has deteriorated and for the past seven years she has been confined to a padded bed to ensure she does not hurt herself when she suffers the debilitating muscle spasms

The mystery condition can flare up at any moment and an episode can last anything from a few minutes to over an hour.

She said: 'When I have a 
bad attack I swell up like the Hulk. I look enormous and I even call 
myself the Hulk, Arnie (Arnold Schwarzenegger) or Rambo. I’m like a 
bodybuilder.'

Although it has never been proven, Ms Stephens blames a car accident in 1999 for the development of her condition.

Within a short space of time, the paralysing shudders left her 
unable to wash, eat or bathe without help and for the past seven years 
she has been confined to a darkened room.

An episode of the muscle stiffening can occur at any time. Ms Stephens says that stress, loud noises and even certain foods can trigger an attack. For many years people simply believed she was a hypochondriac

She said: ‘Everyday I wake up to the same 
thing. It's like being in a coffin. Anything can trigger me to become 
stiff – the cold and stress are the big ones.'

Ms Stephens said that many people simply believed that she was a hypochondriac when she first sought medical help.

But in 2004,
specialists diagnosed her with Stiff Person 
Syndrome and have since managed her symptoms with tranquilisers.

Ms Stephens likens her symptoms to those of the Incredible Hulk

In the documentary her consultant explained that most people require just 10mg of diazepam to make them relaxed enough to undergo an uncomfortable procedure such as an endoscopy, but that Ms Stephens is on 30mg, four times a day.

This, he said, is enough to knock out 12 people.

Ms Stephens said: 'My muscles tear at the same time and they increase in mass meaning my weight balloons.

'If
I don’t get an injection of diazepam quickly enough my whole body 
stiffens, leaving me unable to have any treatment because a needle will 
just snap.

Two weeks after undergoing testing, Ms Stephens receives her results and the documentary finally reveals whether or not Ms Stephens suffers with Stiff Person Syndrome.

They say that even if they are not able to confirm what is wrong with her, the results will be helpful because it means that they can investigate other causes of the condition and try out other treatments.
