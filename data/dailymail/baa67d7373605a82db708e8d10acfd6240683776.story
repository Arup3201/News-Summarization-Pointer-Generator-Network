They were ordinary people doing an extraordinary job – a 20-strong battalion individually serving Queen and country.

Against a backdrop of statues depicting some of the most celebrated figures in British military history, their names were hardly familiar.

But yesterday in Trafalgar Square, in the shadow of Nelson, Napier and others, 20 new statues temporarily went on parade in support of Help for Heroes.

In the shadow of Nelson: Help for Heroes has unveiled 20 sculptures of injured servicemen in Trafalgar Square

Roadshow: Each sculpture will travel to the local community of the serviceman it depicts

The two-dimensional, life-size figures were unveiled in tribute to those wounded in service, some in the bloody conflicts of Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo or Bosnia. Cast and sculpted in clear acrylic, they were designed to represent not only those they depict – but to maintain public awareness that lives and limbs are still being lost. And that thousands are still having to rebuild shattered careers after sometimes devastating injuries.

Soon the statues will embark on separate tours of Britain, visiting the victims’ local communities, military establishments, schools and museums.

The idea is to raise awareness of the sacrifices Britain’s servicemen and women make. Or, as sniper victim Simon Brown put it yesterday: ‘It’s just another way of saying: “Look, we’re normal guys, people from your town”.’

Awareness: Each of the 20 figures depicts a soldier wounded in battle in Afganistan, Iraq, Kosovo or Bosnia

'It's a way of saying 'look, we're normal guys": REME mechanic Simon Brown, 33, lost most of his sight when he was shot in the face in Iraq in 2006

REME (Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers) mechanic Simon, 33, from Leeds, was shot in the face during his second tour of Iraq in 2006. He was hit while rescuing six colleagues under fire in what he described as ‘a turkey shoot’ after their vehicle broke down and stranded them. The rifle bullet went through his left cheekbone and out the other side of his face.

He survived by shoving his thumb up to the palette of his mouth to stop himself choking to death on his blood, then stemming the bleeding while keeping his jawbone together. His mates survived because he hitched his truck to their vehicle and towed them to safety.

The bullet destroyed Simon's left eye 
and permanently damaged his right, leaving him with only 19 per cent 
vision. Standing beside his statue yesterday he told me: 'Take a look at
the guys with missing limbs, who still have smiles on their faces, and 
you realise your life isn’t that bad. If you can let people know they’re
appreciated, and give them a lift, it’s pretty special to them.'

Former Royal Marine Commando Ben Deakin,
26, was shot in the ankle five years ago while serving in Afghanistan. 
He and two colleagues on a rooftop came under heavy fire from inside a 
Taliban compound. His quick-thinking almost certainly saved their lives.

'They were badly wounded and covered in blood', he said, 'I didn’t realise I'd been shot at the time so I helped them. I say helped – I just pushed them off the roof into cover. They probably didn’t think I was helping at the time.'

The statue of Ben, an ex-lance corporal, is likely to be going at some stage to his former barracks at  40 Commando in Taunton. 'With the amount of injuries and the amount of lads who won’t be returning, it’s a way of underlining what an extreme war Afghanistan is', he said.

The Help for Heroes initiative is being sponsored by Bell's, which began its association with the armed forces by sending Scotch Whisky to troops in the First World War. It hopes to raise £1m for the charity through public donations linked to the statues, created by sculptor Stuart Murdoch.

Help for Heroes co-founder Bryn Parry 
stood alongside the statues and their subjects yesterday and said: 'A 
lot of these people have left the services but their battle injuries are
going to be with them for life. There’s a real danger that when we 
start moving out of Afghanistan and we no longer have repatriation 
ceremonies, people will heave a sigh of relief and say the war’s over. 
For these guys, the battle is just beginning.'
