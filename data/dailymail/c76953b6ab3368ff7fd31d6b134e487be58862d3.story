One of the self-proclaimed ‘happy hookers’ was sobbing outside of court after finding out that her ‘husband’ and his father were sentenced to three to nine years in prison.

‘I loved him. I just wanted him home,’ said Desiree Ellis, one of the three prostitutes who testified on behalf of their father-son pair of pimps.

Vincent George Sr. and his son Vincent George Jr. were found guilty last month of money laundering and promoting prostitution but acquitted of more serious sex-trafficking charges, and their matching prison sentences were handed down. 

Sobbing: Desiree Ellis, a self-proclaimed prostitute, cries outside of a Manhattan court on Monday after her two pimps were told of their matching three to nine year sentences

Emotional: Ellis is one of three prostitutes who called themselves 'happy hookers' that worked for Vincent George Sr and Vincent George Jr

Sentenced: Vincent George Jr (left) and his father Vincent George Sr (right) were found guilty of money laundering and promoting prostitution but not the more serious sex trafficking charge they faced

Judge Ruth Pickholtz announced the sentence on Monday without elaboration, and the defendants showed no strong reaction.

But Ms Ellis, an admitted prostitute who was a defense witness, openly wept as she sat in the audience.

Before hearing the sentence, the jailed Vincent George Jr. apologized to Ellis and other women 'for not being there for them' since his arrest last year and for 'wasting the court's time.'

His father declined to speak, but prosecutors said that in pre-sentence interviews, both men refused to take responsibility for their crimes.

At trial, prosecutors alleged that George Sr., 56, and his son, 35, had used both threats of violence and false promises of riches to turn troubled women into virtual sex slaves.

Tears for her 'family': Desiree Ellis, seen left when the Georges were found guilty on June 19 and right on Monday, was said to be sobbing outside of court on July 8 when they were sentenced

The defense argued their clients were exercising free will, calling them 'happy hookers.'

The prostitutes made as much as $500,000 a year for the Georges but got only a few dollars a night themselves and had no bank accounts or property, prosecutors said.

Evidence show that the pimps laundered millions of dollars through music recording and car service businesses.

The Georges warned their prostitutes they would be beaten if they didn't bring in as much money as expected or were late to check in, according to wiretap conversations played at trial.

The women painted a different picture, saying they were treated to nice cars, vacations in Florida and affection from their pimps.

Some lived together as 'family' in a 
house in Allentown, Pennsylvania, about 90 miles from New York, and 
drove in to the city at night to turn tricks for $300, they said.

On the witness stand, the 24-year-old Ellis dismissed allegations that George Jr. abused her, calling him a 'teddy bear.'

She once thought about leaving him. 
But once at a bus station, she changed her mind and asked if she could 
come back to their 'family.' He welcomed her with open arms.

Keeping it classy: Geissler, dressed in a conservative tan pantsuit accessorized with a large cross dangling from her neck, described Vincent George Jr as her sweetheart and 'daddy,' and said that she was in love with him

Carrying on: Heather Keith, who is eight months pregnant with another man's child, also defended the two men for whom she worked. She had the younger George's street name tattooed on her neck

No complaints: Desiree Ellis (seen here when she testified on the pair's behalf earlier in the trial) called Vincent Sr. a 'teddy bear' and was seen sobbing outside of court

'We kissed,' she said. 'We made up. We had a love session.'

Another self-proclaimed hooker, Heather Keith, has 
Vincent George Jr.'s nickname, King Koby, tattooed on her neck. She 
testified she was a drug-addicted 19-year-old stripper from upstate. He 
moved her to Allentown and helped her beat a cocaine habit, she said.

'I would say that I make my own choices,' said Keith, now 26. 'I am not a dumb person. I know what I'm doing.'
