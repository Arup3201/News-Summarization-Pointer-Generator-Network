He had never seen a moose before and would have liked his first encounter to have been at quite some distance.

But unfortunately for Jeff Palmer, nature can be notoriously unpredictable at times.

The 19-year-old was just preparing for another ski run on the slopes of Vermont's Sugarbush Resort when he turned to see a half-tonne bull moose charging right at him.

As the beast honed in, Mr Palmer felt he had no option but to shed his skis and run for his life through the thick snow.

The moose would easily have caught him, but luckily veered off up the slope when he was just a few feet away as his target made a beeline for the woods.

'I was like "You got to be kidding me, this thing is coming right for me",' Mr Palmer told WCAX-TV after the incident, which was caught on video just before Christmas.

'I looked over my shoulder and it was closing in on me very fast. My life flashed before my eyes.'

Phew! The moose would easily have caught him, but luckily veered off up the slope at the last minute

It's not unusual to have moose in ski areas and this particular one has been seen by hundreds of times around the resort over last fortnight.

But Mr Palmer is first person to have
such a hairy encounter with it, especially as it was his first time 
ever seeing the species.

He said: 'It's not the ideal way to 
see the moose the first time. I'd rather see it at a distance rather 
than it charging at me.'

'I'd rather see it at a distance': Mr Palmer said he would have preferred for his first encounter with a moose to have been rather less dangerous

Experts do not believe the moose was 
ill, but had probably discovered an easier way to move around the resort
because of the flattened snow.

They think it was very likely an isolated incident.

That will be of some comfort to Mr Palmer who no doubt hopes his next trip on the pistes will be somewhat less eventful.
