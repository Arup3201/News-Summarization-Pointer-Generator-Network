A Russian motorist has been branded 'the world's worst father' after he forced his eight-year-old daughter to drive his car at more than 60mph on an icy road.

Dmitry Mihulchik, 28, filmed his daughter Karina taking the family Audi for a spin and uploaded the shocking footage online.

He urged the schoolgirl to keep speeding up, even though the car appeared to be drifted into the middle of the road.

Terror: Eight-year-old Karina driving her father's Audi on a rural snow-covered road

Investigation: The girl's parents Dmitry Mihulchik, left, and Lena, right, are the subjects of a police probe

While most Russian web users were highly critical of Mihulchik's behaviour, others praised him and said that they too had been taught to drive from a very early age.

The video shows the father sitting next to Karina, telling her: 'Come on, speed up. Yeah, go go.

'Is it at least 70kph? Don't look at the speedometer, look at the road.'

Then he hands the camera to his 29-year-old wife, who is sitting in the back, saying: 'There you go Lena, have a look.'

Danger: Karina looks nervous as her father tells her to carry on accelerating despite her high speed

Quick: The eight-year-old ended up going as fast as 100kph, which is more than 60mph

As the speed increases, with the father occasionally clutching the wheel to control the car, he tells his daughter: 'Push it to at least 100kph.'

As she tops 90kph (56mph), he tells her insistently: 'Come on, you stop looking at the speed, just press the gas, don't be scared.'

The couple from St Petersburg are facing a police probe over the hair raising drive. 'An investigation has been opened,' said a spokesman.

Neither the eight-year-old driver nor her parents were wearing seatbelts during the drive lasting more than six minutes.

Karina appears nervous at times but finally exclaims after reaching 100kph: 'A child who is only eight years old and already she can drive a car.'

Reckless: Neither Karina not her parents appeared to be wearing a seatbelt during the journey

Help: Mihulchik sometimes put his hand on the wheel to stop the car weaving across the road

Comments from Russians who watched the video included 'brainless', 'complete idiots' and, 'The poor child is not guilty, it is all her parents' fault.'

One site branded Dmitry 'the worst father in the world for this grotesque child abuse'.

Another said: 'How can any parents do this? They should be deprived of their rights to raise the child.'

But others praised the parents for allowing their child to drive.

Success: Karina appeared unharmed after driving the car and boasted of her motoring prowess

'You don't need a lot of experience to hold the steering wheel and press the gas, so there is nothing particularly wrong with that,' Vladimir Revyakin wrote.

'I also learned to drive at about the same age on a deserted highway, though my parents didn't allow me to go more than 80 kph.'

Someone else posted: 'I'm glad that there are still people in this country who teach children how to make the right choice. My dad taught me to drive a car when I was seven years old.'

It is unclear what punishment the parents might face, but some have suggested it could be a fine as low as 2,500 roubles (Â£55) for allowing their daughter to drive without a licence.
