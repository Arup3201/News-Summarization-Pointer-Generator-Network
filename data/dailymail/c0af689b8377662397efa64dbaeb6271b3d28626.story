Ill-timed: Keith Hernandez made the 'honest mistake' when he referred to a broken bat as a 'dead soldier'

A Mets announcer has sparked outrage after insensitively referring to a broken bat as a 'dead soldier' on Memorial Day.

Former Major League Baseball player Keith Hernandez used the term - which is commonly used in baseball to describe shattered bats - as he was commentating on a game, while the nation paid tribute to fallen service personnel.

His slip of the tongue prompted anger from viewers, who took to Twitter branding his comment 'inappropriate', 'insensitive' and 'ill-timed'.

A SNY spokesperson said they would talk to the commentator, who was talking during the New York Mets' game, which saw them win 2-1 over the New York Yankees.

'We'll address the matter with Keith,' they told the NY Daily News.

'It was an honest mistake and a poor choice of words.'

Hernandez, who began playing for the Mets in 1983, made the thoughtless comment when Daniel Murphy's bat splintered against Phil Hughes in the first inning.

He said: 'Well, that is a dead soldier right there, folks, laying in that infield dirt.

'This is... ouch. That’s what you call getting sawed off.'

Later on in the game, player Vernon Wells broke his bat on a pitch - but this time the commentator did not mention the splintered bat, Larry Brown Sports reported.

The 59-year-old's reference would typically be ignored, as it is a common baseball phrase - but Memorial Day is a particularly emotional day for the country, as it gives them a chance to remember all of those who have died while in military service.

Military graves are customarily decorated with wreaths and flags and the occasion, which began after the Civil War, is one deeply embedded in the country's consciousness, and typically marks the beginning of summer.

On his Twitter page the commentator remained silent over his indelicate phrases.

The day was marked by an emotional speech by President Obama.

He paid 
tribute to America's fallen soldiers in a moving Memorial Day speech at 
Arlington National Cemetery - as he urged the nation not to forget the 
tens of thousands of troops still protecting the country in Afghanistan.

'Let
us never forgot to always remember the sacrifice they make in our 
name,' he said at the final resting place for many of America's war 
heroes.

'Today most 
Americans are not directly touched by war, as a consequence not all 
Americans may always fully grasp the depths of sacrifice - the profound 
costs that are made in our name,' he said.

'Our troops, our military 
families understand this and they mention to me whether the country 
fully appreciates what is happening. Let us never forget that our nation
is still at war.'

He 
suggested fewer people are today touched by war due to the all-volunteer
military force and advanced technology that allows the U.S. to 
accomplish some missions with far fewer personnel.

But he reminded the nation not to forget the 60,000 troops who are still fighting in Afghanistan.
