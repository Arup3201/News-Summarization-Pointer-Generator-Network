As she walked down the aisle to marry Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie carried her beloved mother Marcheline Bertrand close to her heart.

Wearing a locket featuring a picture of Marcheline, who died in January 2007 aged 56 after an eight-year battle with ovarian cancer, there was no way, friends say, Angelina could have not remembered her mom on this occasion. 

A source today told MailOnline how Angelina, 39, and Brad, 50, decided to marry at Château Mirava, the stunning French estate they bought in 2011, after Angelina made a promise to Marcheline to wed in France before her death.

By her side: Friends have told how Angelina promised her mother she would marry in France. The pair are pictured together at Los Angeles airport in 1998

The source said: 'Angelina promised her mother before she died that she'd get married in France. They were so extremely close and this is Angie's way of honoring her.' 

Marcheline's father was of French Canadian descent, and her mother was of Dutch and German ancestry, with ancestors who had immigrated to the US in the mid-19th century.

Despite her French roots, Marcheline was often wrongly labelled as a French actress, however,  as Angelina once said: 'My mom is as far from French Parisian as you can get. She grew up in a bowling alley that my grandparents owned.'

Left devastated by her mother's death, Angelina said Marcheline was robbed her of the chance of being a grandmother which 'she was born to be'. 

It was Marcheline's passing that is believed to have prompted Angelina to make the courageous decision to have a preventive double mastectomy in February 2013, later revealing that her chances of developing breast cancer have now decreased from 87 percent to 5 percent.

Marcheline,a fierce campaigner for cancer awareness, founded a charity called Give Love Give Life which spread awareness of the condition.

She and her colleagues at the charity also successfully campaigned for Johanna’s Law to fund education into gynecological illnesses and got it signed into statute in the US.

And mother-of-six Angelina credits Marcheline for having an 'elegance and strength for knowing what was right' that she has always tried to live up to.

The dazzling brunette said: 'My mother was a full-time mother. She didn't have much of her own career, her own life, her own experiences. Everything was for her children.'

While the designer of Angelina's gown is still unknown, E! News claims the star 'definitely wore something that once belonged' to Marcheline.

'It was a small locket with a photo of her mother inside it. She had a veil and Brad gasped when he lifted it because she looked so stunning', the site reported.

Angelina and Marcheline were so close that the star has said that when she got older she considered her mom more like a ‘sister’ than a parent.

The memory of Marcheline still can reduce Angelina to tears, as she said told CBS show 60 Minutes: 'I will never be as good a mother as she was. I will try my best, but I don't think I ever will be.' Choking back tears she added, 'She was the most generous, loving woman.'   

Marcheline married Angelina's father, the actor Jon Voight, in 1971 and had they had two children, Angelina and her brother James Haven, 40, an actor and film producer.

The relationship was strained and they divorced in 1980 because he had an affair with an acting student which led to icy relations with Angelina that have only thawed in recent years.

When Angelina's first biological child, Shiloh was born in Namibia May 2006 Angelina flew with her to see her mother in California as she was too sick to be there in person.

It would be the last new arrival to the family that Marcheline would see before she died.  

Despite being a full-time mother, Marcheline was a producer and actress in her own right and had small roles in the movies ‘Lookin' to Get Out’ in 1982 and ‘The Man Who Loved Women’ in 1983.  

Even though Brad and Angelina's top-secret wedding last Saturday seemed to come out of the blue, a source told MailOnline that the timing of the wedding was 'not some happy accident', adding: 'It was deliberately chosen to commemorate milestone of 10th anniversary of filming of Mr and Mrs Smith. 

'Brad and Angie also wanted to do it before frenetic pre-production and filming began for their new film.'

And the source added that their son Maddox was 'particularly excited' and had been a 'powerful driver' for the two to marry. 

Man and wife: The Hollywood couple tied the knot in France on Saturday, August 23,  in the presence of their six children, a spokeswoman confirmed

Back to work: The actress and director is on location in Malta ahead of production on By The Sea, in which she and new husband Brad Pitt will play a couple who become sexually obsessed with their neighbors 

Done deal: Brad Pitt was more than happy to put his new wedding band on display as he attended a photocall in London on Thursday for his new film, Fury

The source claimed that Brad's ex-wife Jennifer Aniston had 'no idea' and was 'completely blindsided', neither did Angelina's first husband, actor Johnny Lee Miller, who is said to be 'relaxed' as they remain friends and he has re-married.  

Angelina walked down the aisle with her eldest sons Maddox, 13, and Pax, 10, on each arm.

Her daughters Zahara, nine, and Vivienne, six, threw petals, and Shiloh, eight, and Knox, six, served as ring bearers.

The boys all wore cream linen suits, just like Brad's, while the girls each wore a different dress of their choice. 

Brad's parents, Bill and Jane Pitt, were in attendance, along with the groom's younger brother, Doug Pitt, sister Julie Pitt and her two children. While Angelina's father was not invited and only found out about the wedding yesterday - along with the rest of the world.

The whole family: Brad and Angelina's six children travelled with their parents to France on a private jet before the couple tied the knot on Saturday 

Arrivals: The couple landed in Nice on Saturday for their wedding on the same day

The Californian judge who married the couple was also at the civil ceremony, which reportedly had in total 22 guests, the majority made up of Brad's family.  

Brad, who showed off his wedding ring in London yesterday as he promoted his upcoming World War II drama, Fury, is expected to join his new wife in Malta, where she is prepping for their first onscreen reunion since 2005's Mr. & Mrs. Smith.

According to People, the film, By the Sea, which has been described as 'an intimate, character-driven' drama and was written by Angelina herself, is far from family-friendly.

The Pitts will play a married couple in the south of France who become sexually obsessed with their neighbors. (One of the neighbors is played by French actress Mélanie Laurent, who costarred with Pitt in 2009's Inglourious Basterds.)

'I wrote something a few years ago for Brad and me,' Angelina said in May: 'Just for fun. Just an independent little art piece. Because we don't get to do those as much as we'd like. But it's something really small and experimental.'
