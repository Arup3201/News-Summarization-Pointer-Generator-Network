A kind act by a grocery store employee in Canada ended up warming hearts around the world.

Mary Cogswell, 72, has long been a customer at Halifax's Sobey's grocery store and three months ago she met employee Austin MacNeill. As she's legally blind, she often relies on the staff's help.

'She's just a really nice lady,' MacNeill, 22, said of her. 'She's just friendly to everybody and she knows exactly what she wants when she goes around and it makes it easy for us.'

This image of Mary Cogswell, 72, being walked home from shopping at Halifax's Sobey's grocery store by employee Austin MacNeill has gone viral as an act of goodwill 

He's helped her walk to her nearby home several times over the last few months but on Friday the simple act went viral when someone took a picture and put it online. 

Within one day of hitting Facebook the image had more than 13,000 likes and 5,000 shares. 

MacNeil said he never expected to be so well known, but hopes the image might inspire others. 

'One of the ladies from the blind community, she said, ‘You’re more popular than the Queen right now’,' MacNeil joked to Global News. 

MacNeil said Cogswell is a nice woman who always makes it easy for the staff to help her

Cogswell said in the six years she's shopped at Sobeys the staff has helped her for five.

She was declared legally blind in 1987.

'It would be hard. If they weren’t able to help me then I would have to make extra trips down there to get what I need,' she told reporters.
