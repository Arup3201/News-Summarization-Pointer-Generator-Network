Error: Radio presenter Rachel Burden made a joke about crime in Salford but it is safer than their former HQ in London

The BBC’s new home in Salford is safer than its former HQ in London -  suggesting that sensitive management and staff could be unnecessarily worried about security around their northern office.

Bosses have offered workers personal guards to take them to their cars and tram stops but overall crime and violent crime at Media City are both lower than surrounding BBC Television Centre in Shepherd's Bush, Government figures show.

A row about security at the BBC's new base erupted on Thursday after Five Live presenter Rachel Burden made an on-air gaffe accusing the corporation’s neighbours in Salford of being light-fingered.

She was interviewing British Olympic cycling champion Laura Trott on the station’s breakfast show.

When Ms Trott joked about leaving her medals behind in her car, Ms Burden, 35, shot back: 'You left then in you car? Around here?'

This came as a leaked memo sent by Rhian Roberts, head of development for Five Live and Sports Extra, also warned that that the area is a 'different kettle of fish' to the BBC’s base in West London..

But comparing the two postcodes - M50 2LH and W12 7RJ - for the period April 2010 to March 2011 the Salford site had 17,746 crimes while the London site had 18,756.

And the figures for violent crimes were 4,133 and 4,891 respectively, again in favour of Media City.

Salford residents and BBC workers said today they feel very safe.

Mark Graham, 32, who lives near to the site, said: 'I feel as safe living here as anywhere else. Comments like hers (Rachel Burden's) just create the wrong impression.'

Mike Richards, 41, an engineer on BBC Breakfast, who lives in London, said: 'No one has mentioned security concerns to me. It’s definitely safer than White City.'

The BBC’s move to Media City in Salford Quays – where about 1,600 staff are now based, has been riddled with gaffes and controversy, with many presenters refusing to move. BBC Breakfast presenters Sian Williams and Chris Hollins both refused to make the change and have since been replaced.

Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson blasted the BBC’s move last year, describing Salford as ‘a small suburb with a Starbucks and a canal with ducks on it’ and said that he would resign if the motoring programme was moved north.

Miss Burden, a mother-of-three, last year said she was ‘excited’ by the prospect of a move to the North and a new base in Salford.

But she revealed she and her partner would not be selling their four-bedroom London home in Ealing, valued at £650,000.

‘London prices are likely to rise faster than other parts of the country so we want to hold on to it and let it out,’ she said. 

Despite the fears of management and staff their view of crime in Manchester appear to be wrong.

At Media City site in Salford, above, its postcode area had 17,746 overall crimes last year and  4,133 violent crimes.

This is better that the postcode for their old site at Television centre in White City, below, which had 18,756 total crimes and 4,891 violent crimes.

The crime rate has also dropped in Salford 
in recent years but remains slightly above the national average for 
violent crime and robbery.

She added that she was looking forward to settling in an upmarket Cheshire village with good schools and an easy commute to Salford.

She said: ‘I was surprised prices in Cheshire aren’t much cheaper for a similar-sized house to our home, although the gardens are larger. It may not be easy to find a home that ticks every box so we are likely to rent first.’

Explaining her comments on Thursday a spokesman for BBC North said: 'During a light-hearted moment at the end of the interview with Laura Trott, an off-the-cuff remark was made. No offence was intended and we’re sorry if anyone was upset.'

Burden's remarks follow reports that a number of staff have been warned over their safety following the move to Salford.

Corporation chiefs have offered personal security guards to escort men and women to their cars and tram stops from the studios.

And an extraordinary email intended to reassure staff about on-site security will serve only to increase fears, with a BBC executive admitting she has been looking at site security ‘following a couple of incidents’.

In a move costing an estimated 
£1.5billion, the BBC has relocated 2,500 staff across five departments 
including Sport, Children’s and Radio Five Live to the Media City site.

BBC Breakfast made its Salford debut 
on Tuesday, while Blue Peter and Match of the Day are among the 
programmes which air from the futuristic complex.

The offer of personal security applies
particularly for those working late at night or early in the morning.

In the leaked email intended to reassure staff about on-site safety, Rhian
Roberts, head of development for Radio 5 Live and Sports Extra, said 
the measures had been tightened after incidents affecting staff.

‘I’ve been looking at on-site security
on 5 Live’s behalf following a couple of incidents – and also the 
reality that Media City is a different kettle of fish to W12.’

The BBC’s buildings at White City have
private car parks manned by security and which require a pass to enter,
while the Tube station is yards away.

Concerned: Rhian Roberts, left, head of development for BBC Radio 5 live and Sports Extra, said Salford was a 'different kettle of fish' to west London and there has been an offer of personal security for those working late

By contrast, the Salford Quays area 
has open access as a number of businesses operate in the area and is 
relatively deserted after normal working hours. The site is patrolled by
security guards on foot and on Segway electric two-wheeled vehicles.

In the same email, Tony Chebrika, the 
head of security for Peel Media Group – which owns and polices the site –
said he could ‘arrange for escorts’ for frightened staff. Mr Chebrika 
also reassured staff that the site had 300 CCTV cameras, guards on 
constant patrol and a 24-hour control room.

In spite of these precautions, 
however, a wide range of crimes were reported by BBC employees since 
last year including assault, spray-paint damage and thefts.

Upping sticks: Bill Turnbull and Susanna Reid present BBC Breakfast, just one of the programmes that has been forced to relocate to the north

Last year a student staying at a hotel in 
Salford Quays was shot dead in what police described as an ‘unprovoked 
attack’.

John Merry, leader of Salford City Council, yesterday pointed out that crime was not unique to the city.

‘This is just scaremongering,’ he 
said. ‘It is not unusual for complexes like MediaCityUK to have high 
levels of security, whether in Salford, London or any other city.’
