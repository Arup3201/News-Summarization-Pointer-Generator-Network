If it seems you are permanently single while everyone around you is in a relationship, blame your DNA.

Scientists have identified a 'singleton gene'.

Those who have it are 20 per cent more likely to be single than others.

It is thought that by lowering levels of the feel-good brain chemical serotonin, the gene makes people less comfortable in close relationships.

This could make it harder to form them in the first place – or lead to break-up after break-up.

The scientists tested hair samples from almost 600 Chinese university students to analyse a gene called 5-HTA1 which comes in two different versions.

Those with the 'G' version were much more likely to be single than those with the 'C' version.

Some 60 per cent were not in a relationship – compared to 50 per cent of those in the 'C' group.

Importantly, the link couldn't be explained away other factors that influence relationships, including appearance and wealth.

The key to the finding seems to be the role of the 5-HTA1 gene in the brain.

Those with the 'G', or singleton, version, make less of serotonin, a brain chemical involved in mood and happiness.

It was already known that people with the 'G' allele, or version, find it more difficult to get close to others.

Plus, they are more likely to be neurotic and to suffer from depression.

Writing in the journal Scientific Reports, the researchers said: 'As pessimism and neuroticism are detrimental to the formation, quality and stability of relationships, this connection between the G allele and psychological disorders might decrease carriers' dating opportunities or lead to romantic relationship failure.'

The Peking University researchers said that students may have more free time and freedom to form relationships that others.

And at other times of life, other factors, such as pressure from parents to marry, may be much more influential.

Despite this, they concluded that their study provides 'evidence for genetic contribution to social relationships in certain contexts'.

Other scientists said that while genes will inevitably influence relationships, their role in most cases will be small.

Dr Pam Spurr, a relationship expert, said that we don't have to let our genes rule our lives.

She said: 'I know that our genetic heritage determines some of our behaviour but we always have choice.

'If someone's difficulties with dating are flagged up to them, I believe they can learn to interact in a way that will make them more successful in meeting somebody.

'I feel quite optimistic about that.'
