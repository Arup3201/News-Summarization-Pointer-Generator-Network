Best friends: The clever and sociable dog and his handler PC Matt Holding are the most successful partnership of 2012

He has battled rioting yobs, found a missing girl and has an unrivalled record for the number of arrests he has made this year.

And the police officer who looks after Visco the dog isn’t bad at his job either.

The four-year-old German shepherd, pictured in training, is said to be Britain’s best police dog after making 142 arrests in 2012 alongside his handler.

Among those Visco has snared is an English Defence League protester who smashed a female police officer over the back of her head. The dog was kicked and punched in the process of detaining the culprit, but avoided serious injury.

Last month, he used his impeccable tracking skills to find a missing girl who had wandered off after a serious car crash.

‘I have an exceptional bond with Visco,’ said PC Matt Holding, of Staffordshire Police, who was partnered with Visco in 2009.

‘We depend on each other. We know each other’s strengths and weaknesses and we know our limits. But he can be frustrating sometimes. A dog’s mental capacity is a bit like that of an 18-month-old baby, it constantly wants attention. He just wants to work all the time.

'A dog's mental capacity is a bit like that of an 18-month-old baby, it 
constantly wants attention. But he is one of the family.'

The German Shepherd lives in kennels at the home of dog support unit inspector PC Chris Dawson and his partner Jo Willis, who is also a dog handler looks and after Solo.

The couple met through the unit in 2008 and now have three 
daughters, Millie, eight, Hattie, five, and Isla, three.

Last month Visco and PC Holding, who lives with his partner were awarded a Divisional Commendation Award for their sterling work.

Visco, who will be five years old in February, lives outside their house with Solo, but the competitive canines have a slightly strained relationship, despite being friendly dogs.

It was by chance that Visco formed his winning partnership with PC Holding.

The officer was originally assigned to another dog when he joined the unit in 
2008, but the animal was sent to the military because of behavioural problems.

Solving mysteries: Visco has always held the advanced licence, which judges the pair on the dog's obedience and the control the handler has over the animal

PC Holdingand Visco trained for three months together before they were ready for action and the dogs licence is now reissued each year.

He has always held the advanced licence, which judges the pair on the 
dog's obedience and the control the handler has over the dog.

Together they have experienced an array of testing situations,
but one in particular stands out for PC Holding.

He said: 'Back in 2009 we were called to attend an English Defence 
League march in Hanley, Stoke-on Trent where more than 100 members were 
involved.

'We were being attacked from the front and back as well as trying to 
protect some of the officers when a male protester struck a female 
officer on the back of the head.

'I monitored him until I saw him get out of hand again. Then I deployed Visco to detain him.

'Visco was kicked and punched in the process but luckily he wasn't 
injured seriously and was able to detain the offender who was then 
arrested and convicted for violent disorder.

'I think he was given two-and-a-half years in the end and the judge 
commended mine and Visco's bravery. I think that has been the biggest 
demand on the pair of us just because of the sheer volatility of the 
people involved.'

Only last week, they had another success in finding a missing girl.

PC Holding said: 'She was in a serious car crash and sustained injuries but 
managed to get out and wander off before we could get there.

'Visco was able to track and we got her back safe and sound. Without the dog, it would have taken a lot longer.

'It can take a dog just 30 minutes to pick up a track but obviously it 
depends on the circumstances. I find tracking the most rewarding because
it heavily relies on you as a team.'

'You realise how having a dog helps solve so many more crimes. Without a police dog you perhaps wouldn't catch as many suspects.

'For the Visco it's fun, training and work is like playing in the park for him.

'For everything he does successfully I reward him with a ball or something like that. Rarely a snack though.'

Together they work shift patterns of six days on, four days off in one 
of the most successful police dog support units in the country.

PC Holding suggested their success could be due to the area they cover and type of crimes that are committed.

The unit also consists of 12 specialist dogs, who are trained to search for a variety of substances and articles.

Some are trained to search for explosives only and are used to scan 
suspicious packages and carry out searches of areas prior to the arrival
of persons such as Ministers and the Royal Family.

Other dogs are used to search for drugs and firearms. Some have additional skills to search for cash.

So far this year, the unit has carried out 365 searches for drugs, firearms and cash.

One dog in particular, Springer Spaniel Alfie, has had immense success along with handler PC Julie Hargreaves.

This year, Alfie's best finds include a single stash of cannabis to the 
value of £150,000 and £200,000 cash hidden in a car. The vehicle had 
been searched several times by police officers and it was not until 
Alfie had a go that the cash was found in a secret location.

PC Holding and Visco were awarded the Divisional Commendation Award last 
Tuesday for their good work, continued excellent performance, 
motivation and achievement.

PC Dawson said: 'In training Visco 
fares very well in comparison to the other dogs, especially with the 
guidance of his handler. They really put the practice in and we're 
really proud.'
