The Duchess of Cornwall says her own grandchildren call her GaGa. Will Prince George follow suit?

It's a true test of modern family etiquette. Just what do children call their grandfather’s second wife?

Step-gran doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue, and a straightforward ‘gran’ has the potential to cause offence.

But when it comes to little Prince George, it seems as if the Duchess of Cornwall might have the tricky issue cracked – with the unlikely name of GaGa.

Yesterday Camilla revealed to the Daily Mail that ‘GaGa’ is what her own grandchildren call her.

‘I don’t know if it’s because they think I am,’ she joked, ‘but it is still very sweet.’

Camilla disclosed her quirky nickname as she and Prince Charles visited the Sandringham Flower Show in Norfolk, which is held on the Queen’s private estate.

Thousands of well-wishers waited in driving rain to greet the couple, particularly to congratulate Charles on the birth of his first grandchild, Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge.

Seeking shelter in the Sandringham Women’s Institute tent, Camilla chatted proudly about Prince William and Kate’s ‘lovely’ new addition to the family as she stocked up on £1.20 packets of chocolate buns.

For many families in which parents are divorced or separated, the issue of what to call a step-grandparent can become a social minefield, sometimes causing bitter rifts – although clearly not here.

Asked what she had decided to call herself, Camilla told the Mail: ‘That’s something we have got to have a think about. We haven’t decided yet.’

She continued, laughing: ‘My own grandchildren call me GaGa. I don’t know if it’s because they think I am! It is funny but is still very sweet.

‘We are all just about to go off on holiday together, there will be seven children in all. Can you imagine? It can be quite chaotic, but I just love having them around.’

Camilla has five grandchildren under the age of five from the two children she had during her first marriage to Brigadier Andrew Parker Bowles.

Her son, Tom Parker Bowles, has two children with his wife, Sara: Lola, five, and Freddy, three. Her daughter, Laura Lopes, and her husband Harry also have Eliza, five, and twins Gus and Louis, three.

Although she was described as  ‘the Rottweiler’ by William’s late mother Diana, Princess of Wales, friends say Camilla is a warm and generous woman, who adores her growing family.

She frequently chats happily about how the ‘entire brood’ regularly take over her private home in Wiltshire at weekends.

She has also managed to forge an affectionate relationship with her two stepsons, William and Harry, and was seen offering Kate some wifely advice over lunch shortly before her wedding.

As his wife chatted about pet names, Prince Charles was busy collecting gifts from well-wishers to be passed on to baby Prince George, including teddy bears, babygros and books.

Charles said: ‘It’s a wonderful feeling [to be a grandfather]. It’s a very nice feeling, isn’t it?’

He was clearly delighted to receive a teddy bear embroidered with George’s name from 55-year-old Sheila Clark, of Glasgow, asking: ‘You didn’t put a bet on it did you?’ Unfortunately not, she said.

He also told Freda Aspinall, 73, herself a great-grandmother, that baby George was ‘very sweet’ but it was ‘too early to say’ who he looked like.

‘I think I am going to have to go on a babysitting course as it’s a while since I have done this sort of thing,’ he added.
