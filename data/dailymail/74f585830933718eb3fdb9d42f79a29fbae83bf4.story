The on-off girlfriend of Kim Kardashian's infamous sex tape partner Ray J has been arrested for allegedly 'beating him to a bloody pulp'.

TMZ reports that Princess Love attacked her 34-year-old partner  last Wednesday morning around 3am in New Orleans after waiting for him to return to his hotel from a strip club.

Ray J reportedly told police that Princess went 'ballistic' before cracking several of his ribs, busting his lip open, and tearing a ligament in his knee.

Threat: Princess Love, pictured with Ray J back in September, apparently beat the rapper 'to a pulp' after he spent the night at a new Orleans strip club last Wednesday 

Someone staying at the W French Quarter Hotel also apparently heard Princess scream: 'I'm gonna kill you.'

A security guard at the complex then saw Ray J bleeding and called 911, according to TMZ. 

Police confirmed to MailOnline that Princess was charged with domestic abuse and battery.

Putting their argument to one side, Ray J apparently bailed his girlfriend out and paid $10,000 for her lawyer.

Despite the severity of the reports, in recent Instagram photographs Ray does not appear to show any sign of injury. 

His face is not bruised and his lips are not cut. 

Scene of the crime: Someone staying at the W French Quarter Hotel also told TMZ that they heard Princess scream: 'I'm gonna kill you' before the alleged attack 

Were they engaged? Ray, of course, is best known for his relationship with Kim Kardashian during which they filmed their notorious infamous sex tape which was leaked in 2007 (here the couple are pictured in 2006)

Ray J, of course, is best known for his relationship with Kim Kardashian during which they filmed their notorious infamous sex tape which was leaked in 2007.

Kardashian filed a lawsuit against Vivid Entertainment, who distributed the film as Kim K Superstar. 

She then dropped the suit and settled for $5 million.  

Ray - real name William Ray Norwood Jr - and his Love & Hop Hop Hollywood star girlfriend have had something of a fractious relationship of late.

After splitting last October, they fought for custody of their tiny Maltese pooch Boogotti but then appeared to get back together.

Then in December Princess reportedly threatened to take her own life after seeing a photograph of Ray with model Karrueche Tran a day after they decided to go on another break.

Karrueche's representatives later dismissed the claims, telling MailOnline: 'This is not true.' 

MailOnline has contacted Ray's representative for a comment.
