Gillian Velloza has been sentenced to eight and a half years in jail after she pushed her sister out of a second storey window following an argument

A triplet has been jailed today for shoving her identical sister out of a 25ft high window and leaving her paralysed after 'volatile' sibling rivalry spilled over.

Louise Velloza plunged to the ground when her sister Gillian, 24, deliberately pushed her out of the hostel they lived at in Anfield, Liverpool.

It followed years of bust-ups between the pair.

Following the fall, Louise landed on an iron grid in front of the building. She was found lying motionless by a staff member working at the hostel.

Louise, who suffered a serious spinal cord injury, four fractured ribs and 
a punctured lung, is now confined to a wheelchair. She needs 
round-the-clock care and has been told by doctors she will never walk 
again.

After the accident 
Gillian told her lawyer: 'Tell her I love her and I miss her. It is 
killing me knowing what I have done to her but I'm going to pay for it 
and it's going to be a life sentence.

'I
just keep thinking about what happened to her. I'm so sorry for what 
happened kid. I just wish we didn't have that fight, I wish it was me 
not her.'

Then in a letter 
of apology she added: 'There are not enough words I can say that can 
change the situation. I am now living with the guilt of my sister who I 
love more than anything and may never walk again.

'The
thought destroys me every second of the day. I wish this was just a bad
dream. I am so very sorry I hurt my sister. All I can say is that I 
cannot change what has happened as much as I would like. I can't take it
back.

'I'm completely destroyed, alone with feelings of sadness, regret and guilt.'

Today at Liverpool Crown Court, Louise
sat in her wheelchair, eyeballing her sister as Gillian occasionally 
looked over then bowed her head in shame as she admitted causing GBH 
with intent.

After hearing Gillian's excuses and apology, Louise, left court followed by her father.

Passing
a sentence of eight-and-a-half years in jail, Judge Clement Goldstone 
QC told Gillian: 'Louise sustained catastrophic injuries and will never 
walk again.

'She will never have the use or have any control of her body below the ribs. You have quite simply ruined her life.

'It may be that you now truly regret 
what you did but you can scarcely complain about your sister's view to 
your letter. You pushed her out the window deliberately, you had no 
lawful excuse for doing so, you intended to cause her really serious 
injury.

'Even now after your letter you are continuing to minimise your role perhaps that is your way of coping.'

The
tragedy occurred after the identical sisters had been involved in a 
string of sibling bust ups which had resulted in police being called. In
2009 Gillian threatened to stab Louise and on another occasion tried to
strangle her.

The Step One Hostel, Anfield: Simon Driver, prosecuting, said during the evening the two sisters had been arguing, with Gillian shouting at her triplet in the communal TV room

Then last November Louise herself was 
taken to court after attacking Gillian with a knife cutting her finger -
but the pair kissed and made up.

Both
were living in the Step 1 North West Hostel when disaster struck on 
April 30. Simon Driver prosecuting said during the evening the two 
sisters had been arguing with Gillian shouting at her triplet in the 
communal TV room.

The 
sisters were asked to go back to their separate rooms which were located
on the first and second floor. But the situation worsened when Louise 
went into the room of another resident Daniel Frankton, who was staying 
in Room 14.

Gillian followed
her a short time later and appeared to 'annoyed' as she paced up and 
down banging on the door before bursting into Mr Frankton's room.

Mr Driver said: 'The prosecution allege that while the two sisters and Daniel Frankton were in the room, Gillian deliberately pushed her sister out of the second floor window in circumstances that demonstrate the intention to cause Louise serious harm.

'The prosecution allege that she deliberately propelled her sister out of the window. The dimensions were such that it could only be part of a deliberate and determined effort to push her over the safety guard, done with the intention to cause really serious harm.

CCTV showed Gillian fleeing the room moments after after the attack.

Hostel worker Richard Corrigan heard 'a loud thud' and had run outside to find Louise on the ground before Gillian came out and held her sister's hand and was heard to say, 'I have done nothing wrong.'
