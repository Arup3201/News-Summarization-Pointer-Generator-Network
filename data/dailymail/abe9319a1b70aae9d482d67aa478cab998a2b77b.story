The next time you’re cruising the high seas around Honduras it could be on a vessel that was once used to smuggle cocaine and other illicit drugs across international waters.

In the ongoing war on drugs, the Central American country has announced plans to convert boats seized from traffickers into tourist cruisers.

The boats will ferry visitors to hot spots in the picturesque Gulf of Fonseca in the Pacific Ocean, according to Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

Drugs war: Boats seized from traffickers in Honduras will be converted into tourist cruisers

Bordering three countries, the Gulf of Fonseca is becoming a more popular tourist draw thanks to its islands, nature reserves, beaches and rock cliffs.

Some of the areas remain largely untouched by tourists, but Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua are stepping up efforts to stimulate their budding tourism industries.

Honduras hopes the converted drugs boats will bring tourist dollars to a region that is riddled with poverty and located on a major thoroughfare for traffickers.

According to the government’s plans, the main ferry hub would be located in Coyolito, a fishing village surrounded by the San Lorenzo nature reserve that serves as a gateway to the Honduran islands.

The final stop would be the disputed Conejo Island (rabbit island).
