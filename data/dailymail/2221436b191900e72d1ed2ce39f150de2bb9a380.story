Old laptops, televisions and fridge freezers will be able to be exchanged for cash and money off vouchers under a new recycling initiative. 

Sainsbury's, Argos and Samsung are among some of the retailers that have already signed up to the scheme that will see shoppers be able to trade in laptops for £100 or old fridge freezers for £70 off the newest models.

It is estimated that old electrical items worth around £1bn are sitting unused in British homes and the scheme aims to recycle these goods while also saving shoppers money on new products.

Washing machines and hoovers will be able to be traded in for discounts and money off vouchers under a new scheme to recycle electricals and make the industry sustainable and the newest models affordable  

The initiative has been launched by Wrap, a sustainability campaign group, which aims to change the way the electricals industry works and make it more environmentally friendly. 

Liz Goodwin, chief executive of Wrap, said: 'This has the potential to revolutionise how we design, manufacture, sell, repair, re-use, and recycle electrical and electronic products. 

'By making better use of resources, businesses can better safeguard their future through creating new opportunities for economic and environmental benefits, whilst saving consumers money.' 

It will mean people will be able to afford some of the latest models while unused laptops and hoovers that may have spent months sitting in lofts and corners of rooms can be recycled. This will reduce the impact on the environment of constantly developing new technology.

Shoppers will be able to exchange their old iPads for discounts on newer versions under the scheme 

Experts believe encouraging the trade-in of televisions alone could boost the UK economy by £750m per year by 2020. 

Some stores have already started offering customers discounts for exchanging their old items. For example Dell offers people up to £100 off the newest version of their tablets if the trade in an old model, while Currys is giving customers discounts of around £50 to £70 off new fridge freezers if they bring their old electricals into the store. 

Some items are also estimated to attract even bigger discounts when the scheme is implemented. 

Dell offers a trade in service for laptops, phones and tablets. 

Fridges can be traded in for newer models 

Customers can trade their old Venue 11 Pro tablet for £110 off the newest version, costing £339 for the most basic version 

At Curry's shoppers can trade in any old fridge freezer for money off new models, including £50 off a Neff intergrated fridge freezer (right) which costs £689

It is also possible to swap old washing machines for money off new models, such as £70 off a Sandstrom machine which costs £349.99  

For example mid-range laptops that are two years old or newer are still worth £240 while a digital SLR camera that was bought about two years ago is valued at £105.

A four-year-old LCD television with a 22 inch screen attracts a value of £40, while a three-year-old model with a 55 inch screen could be worth £475. 

Wrap said electricals will have a shelf life for exchange - for example laptops are no longer viewed as a good trade economically after seven years, while tablets lose their value after four years.

B&Q, Sky and Homebase are among the 50 companies that have signed up to the scheme so far. All companies have between three and five years to implement it. 

Some  will offer to pick up old televisions and fridge freezers while others will offer customers discounts or money off vouchers if they bring their discarded hoovers and washing machines into the store.

The scheme builds on discounts and cash back deals already offered on the internet, where people can recycle iPad 3 models for around £110 and Samsung S3 smartphones for about £70 if they are in good working order.
