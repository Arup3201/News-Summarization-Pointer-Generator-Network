Pink petunias nestle with rhododendron. Ivy tumbles down from potted red geraniums. Foxgloves peek their heads through a herb bed of mint, rosemary and sage. 

It could be any English country garden in bloom... yet this glorious display isn’t quite what it seems. It was constructed entirely of fake flowers and greenery. 

Artificial flowers and leaves, once condemned as ‘tacky’, have reached new heights of realism and are proving ever more popular.

The imitation greenery used in gardens today is made from polyester silk, which creates a more delicate appearance than the bogus flowers of previous years.

John Lewis has reported a 46 per cent surge in sales of artificial horticulture while Debenhams and Marks & Spencer also report that synthetic blooms are flying off the shelves.

So The Mail on Sunday set about creating a garden composed entirely of ‘fake’ plants and blooms. For our quintessentially English garden, we chose a driveway outside a home in rural Somerset. The space was covered with gravel and featured barely any plant life.

Our transformation started with 20ft by 13ft of artificial turf, which was laid, secured to the ground and brushed.

Perfect finish: Then a backdrop of 'evergreens', mostly consisting of topiary (right) was set in the flowerbeds. After that, the fake lawn was laid using a large brush (left)

Fixed into beds: The garden contained typical summer flowers, which were bought flat-packed and just needed to be gently re-shaped before being fixed into the beds

Then a backdrop of ‘evergreens’ was set in the flowerbeds. This mostly consisted of topiary, including lollipop bay ‘trees’ in fake lead pots and a 5ft ‘bamboo tree’.

Around this base we spread a woodchip mulch for the smaller flowers. Aside from the garden furniture, the mulch is the only non-fake material in the display. 

Our garden contained typical summer flowers, such as foxgloves, dahlias, geraniums and magnolia. The plastic flowers are bought flat-packed and just need to be gently re-shaped before being fixed into the beds.

Spectacular: Come October, for minimal cost, a summer garden can be transformed into an autumn oasis with a few artificial pansies, primroses and cyclamen

Some ‘gardeners’ are reported to keep their artificial patch looking fresh by rotating the flowers according to the season – or even mood.

Come October, for minimal cost, a summer garden can be transformed into an autumn oasis with a few artificial pansies, primroses, cyclamen and a little more ivy.

The outdoor plants and flowers are UV-treated so won’t fade in the sunlight and are hardy enough to survive the wind and rain.

Completed: The bill for the Mail on Sunday's fake blooms, greenery and turf came to about £3,500 - with the fake bay tree at £82.95, the most expensive addition

All the rage: Most 'greenery' will last for about five years, while the turf won't need replacing for 15 years. Above, the completed transformation

The bill for our fake blooms, greenery and turf came to about £3,500 – with the fake bay tree at £82.95, the most expensive addition.

At the other end of the scale, an artificial stem of sweet peas costs £2.20.

Most ‘greenery’ will last for about five years, while the turf won’t need replacing for 15 years. So canny garden fakers will save a little money... not to mention never having to worry about hosepipe bans or the weekly chore of mowing the lawn.
