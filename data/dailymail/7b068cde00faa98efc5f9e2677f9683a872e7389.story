A 13-year-old girl was sold for sex at £20 a time by the teenage boss of a child sex ring, a court has heard.

It was alleged that the girl, who has learning difficulties, was one of five underage girls abused by the gang, headed by 18-year-old Zdeno Mirga.

She was also sexually abused by groups of boys at parties and at a 
playground in a park near her home in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, 
jurors at the Old Bailey heard.

Trial: Zdino Mirga, Hassan Abdulla, Dusan Mirga and David Ziga, pictured left to right, as well as four teenagers, are accused of being part of a child sex ring which abused five underage girls

The court heard that the girl revealed the abuse to her social worker after being taken into care in December last year, and a police investigation led to the identification of another four victims, including the girl’s 14-year-old sister.

Two 14-year-old boys are among the eight defendants, aged between 14 and 32, who are standing trial  on an indictment containing 57 counts, including rape, sexual assault, 
causing or inciting child prostitution, assault by penetration, sexual 
activity with a child and causing or inciting a child to engage in 
sexual activity.

All of the accused are of  Czech, Slovak and Kurdish origin.

The two sisters are from a Czech and Slovak family while the other three victims are English.

Opening the case, prosecutor Angela Rafferty, said: ‘Between April 2012 and December 2012 in Peterborough all these defendants engaged in sexual abuse of teenage girls.

‘Some of them were more heavily involved than others. Some organised and controlled the sexual activity. Some took a spur of the moment decision to become involved.’

Accused: The trial at the Old Bailey in London was told that Zdeno Mirga was paid £20 by a man aged around 50 so the girl would perform a sex act on him

Miss Rafferty warned jurors: ‘You will be hearing some very graphic descriptions of sexual matters.’

The court was told that all of the victims were aged between 12 and 14 when the alleged abuse took place, and that Mirga, known as Skinny, was said to be at the centre of the case.

Miss Rafferty said: ‘It is the prosecution’s case that Zdeno Mirga is a forceful young man and can at times appear very charismatic and controlling.’

The main 13 year-old victim, who has learning difficulties, claims he forced her to have sex with other boys and men.

‘He wanted to receive money from the other males for her sexual services,’ said Miss Rafferty.

The court heard, a man aged around 50 paid Mirga £20 so the girl would perform a sex act on him.

‘She refused but was effectively forced to do it,' Miss Rafferty added.

It was alos alleged that Mirga told the girl that he wanted money for ‘weed and vodka'.

He is standing trial alongside his brother Dusan Mirga, 20, of Peterborough, David Ziga, 19, of  Sheffield, Hassan Abdulla, 32, from, Peterborough, as well as two 14 year-old boys and two 17 year-old boys who cannot be identified because of their ages.

The trial continues.
