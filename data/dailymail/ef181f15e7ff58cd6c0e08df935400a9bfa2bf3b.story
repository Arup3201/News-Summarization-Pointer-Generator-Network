They don't usually have much common ground but in a rare moment of unity lawmakers on Capitol Hill held hands and swayed together as the famous song from the Civil Rights movement We Shall Overcome was played.

Some of the lawmakers, which included House Speaker John Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, looked slightly awkward as they held their arms across their bodies.

Congressional 
leaders commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act on 
Tuesday by posthumously bestowing the Congressional Gold Medal upon 
Martin Luther King Jr. and his wife, Coretta Scott King, for their 
efforts in passing the landmark legislation.

The
 Kings' children, Martin Luther King III, Dexter Scott King and Bernice 
A. King, accepted the honor in as several hundred 
looked on.

The civil rights leader was assassinated in Memphis, 
Tennessee, in 1968.

His wife died in 2006.

'The
 Civil Rights Act transformed our country,' House Minority Leader Nancy 
Pelosi of California said. 'It made America more American.'

President Lyndon B. Johnson 
signed the Civil Rights Act into law on July 2, 1964.

It helped end 
legal discrimination based on race, sex, color, religion and national 
origin, and many consider it the most significant law to come out of the
 civil rights movement.

Among
 those joining Pelosi in praising the Civil Rights Act and the people 
who made it happen were Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of 
Kentucky, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada and House Speaker 
John Boehner of Ohio.

Throughout
 the lawmakers' remarks were calls for a return to the bipartisanship 
that made laws like the Civil Rights Act possible.

Remembering
 the civil rights activists who marched, protested and faced brutality 
and violence is vital, the lawmakers said.

But they added that it was 
important to remember the lawmakers who made passage possible.

Boehner
 said the Civil Rights Act might be the 'most fundamental, the most 
consequential legislation' in American history.

McConnell said that 
Martin Luther King Jr. deserves as much credit as any lawmaker in 
getting the law passed.

'His
 role was not just to expose or to confront injustice, but to prepare 
the country to actually do something about it,' McConnell said.

It
 was the second Congressional Gold Medal awarded to the Kings for their 
contributions to the civil rights movement.

The previous medal was 
awarded in 2004.

Bernice 
King said in a statement that she and her brothers were deeply honored 
that their parents were recognized for their 'tireless and sacrificial 
leadership to advance freedom and justice.'

The
 King siblings have been locked in a legal dispute over the ownership of
 King's Bible and Nobel Peace Prize.

The Martin Luther King Jr. Estate 
Inc., which is run by Martin Luther King III and Dexter Scott King, 
wants to sell the items, while Bernice is opposed to the sale. Their 
eldest sibling, Yolanda King, died in 2007.

The
 Congressional Gold Medal will be held in the newest Smithsonian museum,
 the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which is 
expected to open next year.

'The
 Smithsonian will ensure that as long as there is an America, the 
courage, the impact and the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta
 Scott King will be honored, preserved and remembered,' said Lonnie 
Bunch, the founding director of the museum.
