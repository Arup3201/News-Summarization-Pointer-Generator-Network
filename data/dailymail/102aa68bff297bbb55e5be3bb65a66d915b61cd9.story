Two men have been jailed for a large-scale human trafficking ring which saw Hungarians lured to work in the UK as modern-day slaves - being paid a measly £10 for a 100-hour week.

Up to 50 men were kept in one house in Batley, West Yorkshire, and were subjected to regular beatings - with one house rule that no-one could say ‘no’ to their keepers.

Janos Orsos, 43, and Ferenc Illes, 25, were sentenced on Tuesday at Teesside Crown Court to five years and three years respectively after pleading guilty to people trafficking offences.

The court heard Orsos preyed on vulnerable Hungarians with promises of well-paid factory and labouring work and accommodation.

But on arrival they were faced with squalid and cramped accommodation, long hours with barely any pay, and beatings from Orsos if they disobeyed his orders.

Workers lived in accommodation in Ravensthorpe, Batley, Heckmondwike and Bradford, where beatings were regularly dished out by Orsos.

They were then sent to work throughout Dewsbury, Bradford and Wakefield. Many were too scared to escape and one woman who had lost her job feared for her life after she overheard Orsos saying she would be killed.

Sentencing, Judge Peter Armstrong said the victims were forced to live in 'severely cramped, multi-occupancy rooms in Dewsbury and left in fear of violence if they protested'.

West Yorkshire Police launched Operation Tavernhouse back in 2011 after an alleged victim - a 20-year-old man - contacted the charity Hope For Justice and told them he was being exploited.

More victims soon came forwards and others were identified, helping officers to build a case which identified the principle suspects.

Among those exploited was a 45-year-old woman who was kept prisoner and forced to do housework for free. She was not given clothes and was only fed once a day during her captivity.

She was later given more freedom and was eventually able to flee and catch a train away from the town.

The court heard a Hungarian man was put up in Ravensthorpe and forced to work for more than 21 weeks for just £30 and lost more than 10 kilos in weight.

Both Illes, of Dewsbury, and Orsos, of Heckmondwike, admitted charges of conspiracy to traffic people within the UK for exploitation dating back to 2011.

The pair were due to face a six-week trial with 13 witnesses who had been trafficked by the pair, until they pleaded guilty.

Orsos was also guilty of blackmail and converting criminal property. The court heard he made at least £60,000 from the conspiracy, which was sent out of the country using a Western Union account.

Sentencing him, Judge Peter Armstrong said: 'This was a criminal enterprise from the outset. Having got people to come to this country you were in effect number one in the gang over here.

'These people were forced to work by being in an atmosphere of fear of being beaten or having no alternative economic means of moving away.'

Illes was described by Judge Armstrong as Orsos’s 'right hand man'. He was in charge when Orsos was away and drove victims to and from work.

Judge Armstrong added: 'You were aware of the conditions in which these people were living and the conditions in which they were working yet you were prepared to work for this gang, albeit acting under instructions from Orsos.'

Det Sgt Paul Simm, of Kirklees CID, added: 'We are pleased to see the conviction of Orsos and Illes today for offences which, quite simply, should not be taking place in 21st century Britain.'

Hope For Justice director of operations Allan Doherty said after the case: 'With upwards of 30 or 40 people living in a two-bedroom house, can you imagine the smell, the overcrowding, the dirt?

'People were living on scraps of food or slop that was reheated again and again.

'You wouldn’t let animals be kept in those conditions. This case highlights the issues of human trafficking and I know people hearing this sickening story today will be shocked that slavery is happening in their towns.

'But the fact of the matter is that human trafficking is a significant and unacceptable problem in Britain in the 21st century.'

Det Chief Insp Paul Jeffrey of Kirklees CID, added: 'These convictions have followed a long running, detailed and at times, difficult investigation and I want to thank partners including Hope For Justice, who have worked with us to bring this case to a conclusion.

'I would encourage anyone who feels they may be a victim of this type of trafficking and is being exploited to contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.'

West Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner Mark Burns-Williamson, who is spearheading the creation of the national working group to tackle human trafficking, said: 'This very sad case demonstrates yet again that human trafficking is an issue which exists within West Yorkshire and that fact cannot be ignored.'
