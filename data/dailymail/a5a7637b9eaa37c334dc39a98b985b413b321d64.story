THE eurozone yesterday came out of its longest recession since the single currency was launched in 1999 – but economists warned that the crisis is far from over.

The continent is still so blighted by rampant youth unemployment and staggering levels of government debt that even the Brussels commissioner responsible for the 17-nation bloc warned against premature celebrations.

Economists did welcome the signs of recovery in the eurozone, which has been mired in a slump for 18 months, but said there is a long way to go before the 300 million-plus citizens of the single currency area can expect an end to their misery.

On the up: The combined economies of the 17 eurozone countries grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter of 2013

Figures released yesterday show the 
eurozone’s economy grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter of this 
year compared with the first three months, finally ending the recession 
that first hit the single currency area in the final three months of 
2011.

The crisis afflicting the region has 
thrown millions onto the dole queues and provoked a wave of violent 
protests on the streets as governments have tried to revive their 
economies and reduce their excessive borrowing through draconian 
austerity measures.

It threatens to create a ‘lost 
generation’ of young people unable to find jobs. The youth unemployment 
rate is nearly 24 per cent for the euro area overall, and a crippling 
58.7 per cent in Greece and 56.1 per cent in Spain.

Official figures also revealed that 
while stronger nations are returning to growth, weaker countries are 
still struggling. Germany, the region’s industrial powerhouse, grew by 
0.7 per cent in the second quarter and the French economy managed growth
of 0.5 per cent, both better results than experts had predicted.

But Spain and Italy were still in 
recession, and comparative figures for troubled Greece are not yet 
available. The growth rate of minus 4.6 per cent in Greece is compared 
with last year rather than the first three months of this.

Europe’s economic monetary affairs 
commissioner Olli Rehn said the figures suggested the European economy 
was gradually gaining momentum, but added that there was no room for 
complacency. ‘There are still substantial obstacles to overcome: the 
growth figures remain low and the tentative signs of growth are still 
fragile,’ he said.

Despite the improved growth figures, 
weaker eurozone nations are still beset by problems including high 
unemployment, particularly among the young, enormous public debt 
burdens, crippled banking systems and poor competitiveness.

Commentators say the eurozone as a whole is also held back by rigid labour market laws.
The overall eurozone growth rate of 0.3 per cent in the second quarter 
compares with 0.6 per cent in the UK, 0.4 per cent in the US and 0.6 per
cent in Japan, according to the EU statistics agency Eurostat.

Howard Archer, economist with 
independent forecaster IHS Global Insight, said: ‘There is an underlying
impetus towards recovery but the eurozone is not out of the woods yet. 
Maybe it is a little bit nearer the edge of the woods.’

The consulting firm Fathom commented:
‘Although these figures are welcome, doubts about the sustainability of
this recovery persist. These figures do not signal the all-clear for 
the euro crisis.’
Members of the zone were hit by three major problems. First, by taking 
advantage of interest rates set at low levels to suit the prudent 
Germans, poorer countries were able to rack up huge debts, which they 
then struggled to repay.

Second, when the 2008 financial 
crisis hit, they had no control over either interest rates or their own 
currency. Third, in return for bailouts, countries such as Greece and 
Ireland had to sign up to tough austerity policies.

Andrew Smith, chief economist at 
accountant KPMG, said: ‘Recovery has to start somewhere, but the 
periphery countries are still in a lot of trouble.’
