Football is rife with a shocking level of 'institutional discrimination', according to a think tank founded by a group of former Premier League players.

The Sports People's Think Tank (SPTT) will release a report in parliament on Monday exposing the prejudices faced by black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) people looking to take up positions of authority in the game.

Figures published by the Professional Footballers' Association earlier this month showed BAME people currently fill just under four per cent of backroom staff positions in the Football League.

Former striker Jason Roberts (pictured) says 'football has failed to complete the promise of true equality'

'Football has failed to complete the promise of true equality,' Jason Roberts, a former Blackburn striker and a founding member of the think tank, told the Observer.

'The numbers point to a problem that any right-minded individual would be shocked at.

'Most disappointing is the game's overall refusal, up to this point, to engage in some dialogue which challenges the decision-makers and leadership of the game, rather than focusing on the victims of these practices - prospective BME coaches and managers.'

The research has been funded by Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE) and may prompt renewed calls for 'the Rooney Rule', a regulation used in the NFL making it compulsory for employers to interview minority candidates for vacancies.

The SPTT is backed by PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor and also includes West Brom Under-21s development coach Darren Moore and former Birmingham defender Michael Johnson. 

Manchester City's Yaya Toure was subject to racist chants last year during a game against CSKA Moscow
