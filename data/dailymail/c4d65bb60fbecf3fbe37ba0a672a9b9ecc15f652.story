A man has died in Venice after a gondola carrying a family of tourists collided with a ferry on the city's famous Grand Canal.

The German man is thought to have been crushed to death when the gondola, which was carrying five members of the same family, was hit by a public 'water bus' close to the Italian city's busy Rialto Bridge.

A three-year-old girl thought to be his daughter was taken to hospital in Padua in with serious head injuries.

Initial reports suggested the gondolier and all five passengers had fallen into the water when the boats collided at the busy Rialto Bridge - one of Venice's most picturesque and popular spots - at around 12pm today.

But police spokeswoman Erica Veronica Di Francesco said nobody had ended up in the water.

She said the vaporetto - the public bus that 
ferries passengers around the Italian cities famous waterways - was pulling into dock when it crashed 
into the gondola carrying the German family.

The city's mayor is now convening experts to resolve the growing problem of congestion on Venice's waterways in the wake of the fatal accident.

Mayor Giorgio Orsoni, who expressed his condolences following the crash today, said it was time to confront the problem of traffic clogging the city's canals.

'The problem of water traffic congestion, in high periods and in particular areas of the centre, is real,' the mayor said in a statement.

Police and rescue workers were inspecting the scene of the accident in the Italian tourist hotspot this afternoon.

Condolences: Venice's mayor expressed his condolences in the wake of the accident, and some gondoliers stopped service today as a mark of respect, according to local reports

In a sign of mourning, some of Venice's gondoliers ceased service this afternoon, the ANSA news agency said.

It quoted the head of Venice's gondolier's association, Nicola Falconi, as saying the increased congestion is due to new vaporetto lines that have entered service along with private boats - primarily from hotels - clogging the Grand Canal.

The Rialto Bridge is the oldest of four bridges spanning the Grand Canal in Venice.
