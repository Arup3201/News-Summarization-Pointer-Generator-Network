Bystander: Anthony Diaz, 13, was shot dead Sunday night on the northwest side of Chicago while he was filming a fight between two groups of high school-age girls

A 13-year-old boy in Chicago was shot to death Sunday night as he filmed a fight between his older sisters and another group of  girls which was sparked by an online feud.

Anthony Diaz, 13, left his home on the north west side of the city after 10pm with his 15- and 16-year-old sisters. As he was filming the fight about a block away from their home, someone approached and shot him.

Paramedics rushed the Belmont Cragin Elementary School student to Mount Sinai Hospital where he was later pronounced dead at 11:30pm.  

Police have not yet released a description of the shooter, who remains at large.  

Diaz's stepfather Ralph Otero, an Evangelical preacher, says he saw the teen leaving the house with his sisters and went to wake his wife because he didn't like them going outside so late.

He estimates they were gone for no longer than five minutes when Diaz's 17-year-old sister called hysterically, saying he had been shot.

'(Anthony's mother) was telling me "They shot Anthony, they're telling me they shot Anthony." So when I got there he was already laying on the ground,' Mr Otero told the Chicago Tribune. 'And the paramedics were working on him.'

'When I got there, I knew it would be bad ... they said they shot him over 7 or 8 times. They came right next to him and I guess when he fell, they came and kept on shooting,' he added.

Diaz's sister Jennifer Sosa told ABC 7 that the fight was sparked by disrespectful comments on social media. 

'She was dissing our gang. We came, we fought. They just got out of hand. They jumped all of us and they ended up shooting my brother,' Ms Sosa said. 

She says they expected to get into a brawl, but did not think anyone would bring a gun.

The shooter allegedly shot Diaz once, and then stood over the victim while continuing to fire several more rounds. 

Police found at least four casings in the snow next to where Diaz was found struggling. 

They also were able to retrieve Diaz's phone, and the video files of the fight. 

Mr Otero said his stepson excelled in school and loved basketball - especially hometown team the Chicago Bulls.

'He’s a good student, he’s not a gangbanger. He didn’t give us any headaches,' Mr Otero told NBC Chicago.

'He was a handsome kid. Very smart. I love him with all my heart, I don't know what I'm going to do without him,' Diaz's mother Laura Otero told ABC 7. 

The family also just moved to the area in hopes that it would be safer for their children. Diaz was one of six siblings.  

Mourning: Diaz's mother Laura Otero cried as she spoke with reporters early Monday morning. Diaz has been described as a good student who loved basketball
