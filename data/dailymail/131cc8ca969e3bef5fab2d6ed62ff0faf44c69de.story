When it comes to golfing achievements, there’s no better company to keep than Tiger Woods and Sir Nick Faldo, and Justin Rose found himself linked with both following his gutsy play-off success in the PGA Tour event staged in America’s capital on Sunday.

Victory at the Quicken Loans National was Rose’s sixth triumph since 2010 on the hardest tour of all. The only man who has won more tournaments in America during that time frame is Tiger. Also, Rose has now pulled up alongside Sir Nick for the most titles claimed on US soil by an Englishman since 1945.

Now it’s back to the UK for the Scottish Open at Royal Aberdeen next week, followed by the Open Championship on home turf at Royal Liverpool.

Not for the first time, Rose will step on to the first tee at an Open with a rising sense of expectation. It was like this last year, following his major breakthrough the previous month at the United States Open. It was the same in 2010, when he arrived at St Andrews having achieved two victories in the space of a month.

Golfers, generally, don’t react well when the spotlight is shining and there are a million distractions to cope with, and Rose duly missed the cut on both occasions. Indeed, his best performance by a country mile in an Open remains that unforgettable fourth-place finish he managed as a 17-year-old amateur at Royal Birkdale in 1998.

If truth be told, that prodigious effort has hung like a millstone around his neck, a constant reminder that this was the tournament it was his destiny to win.

Now, practically half of his lifetime later and a few miles south along the same patch of glorious golfing coastline, there’s every reason to believe the hype will be matched with deed and Rose, 34 at the end of this month, can finally contend down the stretch once more.

Rose has now won six tournaments on the US Tour since 2010

On Sunday he showed his most overlooked quality which is just how deep he can dig. A tournament he had dominated towards the close of the final afternoon was in danger of running away from him when his bad shot, a hook from the tee, made an unwelcome appearance under pressure. 

It says much about a man when the two longest putts he holes all day come in the most stressful of circumstances.

One at the 17th rescued a par while the 18-footer for a bogey at the 18th, holed amid the brain-scrambling consequences of a foolish approach that looked to have cost him the title, must be among the best he has made.

The subsequent play-off against the game American Shawn Stefani saw a recent major winner against a man who has never won on tour — and it showed.

Rose played his best golf when the conditions became firm and fast over the weekend and that’s certainly how it looks like Hoylake will be playing.

The last time it was staged there, in 2006, he was watching on television. It was during one of those slumps that have punctuated his rollercoaster career and given him the inner strength we saw again on Sunday.

Tied 14th at The Masters and tied 12th at the US Open, Rose offers real cause for the home nation at the British Open to believe.

‘I’m very excited about getting back to Hoylake. I’m excited to play that course. I don’t know how it’s changed since we played it in 2006. It has been a bone dry winter in England.’ 

Ok, so the terrible winter floods were not big news in the Tiger Woods household. But we certainly welcome the rest of this comment from the 14-time major winner, don’t we? Against the odds it really looks like the main man will be at Royal Liverpool in a fortnight. And yes… we’re excited too, Tiger.

Journeyman Owen a winner at last

Away from the glitz and glamour of the PGA Tour came welcome news from the subsidiary circuit, the Web.com tour, where 42-year-old Englishman Greg Owen was making his 249th start in America since leaving these shores and going west in 2006.

He has mustered a clutch of top 10s, including three runner-up finishes — most notably in the 2006 Arnold Palmer Invitational, where he heartbreakingly three-putted from five feet at the 17th. He carved out a nice living for himself and his family, with around £4.5million in earnings. The thing that was always missing was a victory.

But Owen broke his duck at the United Leasing Championship, going eagle-birdie-birdie from the 15th to win by one. It was his first win anywhere since the British Masters in 2003, and gives him every chance of reclaiming full privileges for the main circuit next year.

The £65,000 first prize was a fraction of that won by Rose, but the elation Owen felt was surely the same.
