ISIS has filmed the destruction of a large cannabis stash near the besieged city of Aleppo and uploaded the action onto a radical Islamic website. 

The terrorists found the drugs in a shed in the village of Characola, near Aleppo and carted outside using a wheelbarrow.

The 50kg stash would be worth in the region of £500,000 if it was smuggled into the UK, was doused in an inflammable liquid before being set alight.

The drugs, which would be worth more than £500,000 in the UK were piled into the middle of a courtyard

One terrorist showing little regard for health and safety guidance continued to pour the fuel onto the fire as it burned. 

ISIS claimed that the information was released by the 'Information Office of the mandate of Aleppo'. 

The terrorist organisation has been destroying cannabis farms discovered in its territory. 

ISIS claims to be against the use and cultivation of drugs such as cannabis and heroin, unlike the Taliban in Afghanistan who 'tax' farmers to be allowed to grow the lucrative crop. 

A report issued late last year by the United Nations found that more than half-a-million acres of land is being used to grow opium. 

It is believed that 6,400 tonnes of opium was produced in 2014, slightly down on the record 7,400 tonnes in 2007. 

The survey claimed: 'In 2014, opium prices decreased in all regions of Afghanistan. One probable reason for the decrease was an increase in supply due to an increase in production.'

Several boxes full of drugs were also tossed onto the pile, including one with the name 'Brilliant' 

Despite the intoxicating fumes, the terrorist continues to pile the drugs on top of the burning mound

Eventually both men retreat to a safe distance while the drugs burn vigorously in the courtyard
