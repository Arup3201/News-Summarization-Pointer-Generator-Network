Jeffrey Daday has admitted stealing $89,000 from meters he was being paid to empty over a five year period

A parking attendant had admitted stealing $89,000 by pocketing an estimated 356,000 quarters from meters he was being paid to empty over a five year period.

Jeffrey Daday, 35, from Brewster in New York state, was tasked with collecting the proceeds of meters in the village of Mount Kisco and delivering them to the local council office.

But a police surveillance team were stunned to see the burly parking attendant emptying meters before heading straight to a bank to deposit the coins in his account.

Daday pleaded guilty to charges of second-degree grand larceny and first-degree offering a false instrument for filing in Westchester County Court in White Plains, N.Y..

He faces a potential jail term of 15 years. There is no minimum sentence for the crime for first time offenders in New York state.

Police were called to investigate after council officials realised tens thousands of dollars had gone missing over the five-year period.

Officers swooped as Daday left the bank and arrested him on suspicion of depositing the coins into his own personal bank account.

District Attorney Janet DiFiore said Daday's crime spree began on January 5, 2009 and continued until his arrest in May this year.

Parking metres in the Westchester County area take quarters (25 cent coins), dimes (10 cent coins) and nickels (5 cent coins).

To amass a total of $89,000, Daday would have had to have taken 356,000 quarters or 890,000 dimes or 1.78 million nickels.

Daday is the second warden in the area to be caught stealing from meters in recent years.

The first warden stole $30,000 (Â£18,000) in quarters which he stored in a camera bag which he kept inside his car.
