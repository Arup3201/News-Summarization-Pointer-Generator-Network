To his victims he was an Italian aristocrat, a tragic cancer sufferer, an IT executive, even a songwriter for a famous rock band.

In reality, Scott Travis was nothing more than a jobless conman living on benefits in a shabby council flat in Rochdale.

The smooth-talking chancer constructed a web of lies and fake identities – including Viscount Franco Dibella III – to swindle his girlfriend and a pensioner out of hundreds of thousands of pounds.

His charades allowed him to buy a 
£50,000 Lexus car, have cosmetic surgery and stay for six weeks in a 
£200-a-night hotel alongside showbusiness stars.

He enjoyed weekends in Monte Carlo, 
employed a chauffeur, drank £80 bottles of Bollinger champagne and wore 
suits from designer boutiques.

Among his lies, the 44-year-old even 
claimed to be awaiting a fortune in royalties after writing songs for 
the British rock band Whitesnake.

Last night, however, Travis was 
facing up to life behind bars after a jury took just ten minutes to 
convict him of stealing the £100,000 life savings of an elderly man he 
conned by pretending to have cancer.

The scam saw him befriend the victim,
whose identity was protected by a judge, over seven years and persuade 
him to hand over cash for specialist treatment.

On one occasion, he even arrived at the man’s home with a bandaged head, claiming to have just had a brain tumour removed.

When the man became suspicious, 
Travis, who police believe has been known by at least four fake 
identities and once changed his name by deedpoll, claimed he needed more
cash because he was being threatened by gangsters over unpaid loans.

Minshull Street Crown Court, 
Manchester, was told the conman dreamed up his life of lies after being 
duped by his family over the identity of his mother.

The hearing was told that his mother 
was just 15 when she gave birth to him in 1967, but her parents were so 
embarrassed that they secretly brought him up in the Greater Manchester 
town as their own – allowing him to believe his mother was his sister.

When, aged 18, he found out the truth he was broken-hearted, the court was told.

Travis was first exposed as a liar in
2005 when he was jailed for 16 months after he pretended to be his 
girlfriend, Gail Heyworth, 50, to secure a £7,500 loan. He even imitated
a woman’s voice when he spoke to brokers from the company on the 
telephone.

He also stole a winter heating cheque
from Miss Heyworth’s 67-year old father and used the pensioner’s 
details to obtain mobile phones and credit cards.

Another scam saw Travis pretend to be
the manager of a computer firm earning £35,000 a year to secure a car 
loan, while claiming benefits under another false name.

The conman sowed the seeds for his 
latest fraud in 2003 when he befriended his elderly victim after reading
a newspaper advert the pensioner had placed seeking companionship.

Posing as ‘Franco’, the orphan son of
an Italian aristocrat who was set to inherit millions, Travis begged 
the man for £20,000 for cancer treatment, plus another £9,000 to pay off
a gangster.

The pensioner initially went to police, who warned him he might be the victim of a conman, but he decided not to press charges.

Later, Travis returned and claimed he
needed a further £35,000 to release cash from the will of his mother, 
whom he said had died in a car crash in Naples.

He even paid a friend £500 to pose as
a gangster who went to the pensioner’s home saying he was going to hurt
‘Franco’ unless the victim paid £30,000.

The pensioner later told police: ‘He 
was very angry. He said: “If you don’t get my money I’ll shoot you and 
him.” I was scared to death.’

The court also heard from a taxi 
driver paid to act as chauffeur for Travis only to be left with an 
unpaid bill of £1,265. ‘I fell hook, line and sinker for the lies told 
by him,’ he said. ‘His stories were so good, anybody would have believed
them. I felt used, abused and foolish.’

Travis, who was convicted of four 
offences of obtaining money orders by deception, one of fraud and two 
offences of blackmail, will be sentenced tomorrow.
