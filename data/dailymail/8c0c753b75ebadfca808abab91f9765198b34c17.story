Juventus are pressing ahead in their £2million bid to sign Manchester United left-back Patrice Evra.

It is understood the France captain's wife is keen to move but new United manager Louis van Gaal wants the 33-year-old to stay.

The Italian champions will offer Evra a two-year deal worth £55,000-a-week after tax.

Wanted: Juventus have offered £2million for Manchester United left-back Patrice Evra

Money: The Italians will offer Evra a contract worth £55,000-a-week after tax

Louis van Gaal is well aware of Evra’s popularity within Old Trafford but accepts that the player also wants to play.

The arrival of Luke Shaw means he will be marginalised compared to his previous seasons at United so they are considering the option of another left-back with Wolfsburg’s Ricardo Rodriguez a candidate.

Liverpool have also considered Rodriguez but Wolfsburg want around £15m for the Swiss international who impressed against Argentina and Lionel Messi in the World Cup.

United remain keen on Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal but the Turin-based club want £37m for their Chile star.

Van Gaal is believed to be keen to sign the Chilean, who represented his country at the World Cup in Brazil.

United have made tentative enquiries as to Vidal's availability but they are currently miles away from Juve's valuation.
