A three-year-old boy died after being left for three hours in a car in Arizona while temperatures soared towards 100 degrees.

Hayden Nelson died in hospital after being stuck in the vehicle outside a church in Phoenix between 11am and 2pm - the hottest part of the day.

He had been driven to the Abundant Life Church in the south of the city that day by a 27-year-old family friend, who 'forgot' him while she went to choir practice.

His mom was also at the practice inside, and had arrived before the family friend, who had two other children with her.

By the time Hayden was found - after practice was over - he had stopped breathing. Temperatures of 97F were recorded in Phoenix that day.

According to AZCentral, police estimated that temperatures in the car could have exceeded 120F.

A police spokesman said: 'It's obvious that the 27-year-old forgot that the child was in the car.'

'She was in a hurry. She had something that she had to do, and she didn't take a minute to make sure.' 

'You cannot imagine what this lady is going through right now, what this family is going through.' 

Prosecutors are debating whether to press criminal charges against the woman, who has not been named.
