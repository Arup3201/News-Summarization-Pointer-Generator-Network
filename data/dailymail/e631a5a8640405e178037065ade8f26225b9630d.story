Dismissed: Dizaei arrives at court with wife Shy before he was convicted for misconduct and perverting the course of justice at a retrial in February

Corrupt police chief Ali Dizaei has lost his job at Scotland Yard for a second time.

The 49-year-old, who has twice been jailed for corruption, was dismissed from his post as commander after an internal disciplinary tribunal.

A spokesman for Dizaei confirmed the ruling but added: 'His case against the Metropolitan Police Service and his conviction is not over.'

The sacking was a formality after his 
career was effectively ended by his conviction for misconduct and 
perverting the course of justice at a retrial in February.

He
received a three-year prison sentence - reduced by the time he already 
spent behind bars after guilty verdicts in 2010 were quashed a year 
later by the Court of Appeal.

Dizaei
won his job back with the Metropolitan Police before the retrial, but 
had been suspended on full salary, pending the disciplinary process.

Dizaei’s
spokesman said he 'has been down this road before where he was 
prematurely dismissed from the force in 2010 when there was a live 
appeal against his conviction'.

He added: 'He notes with interest how the Met remained silent when he won 
his appeal and was reinstated last year and today the MPS (Metropolitan 
Police Service) department of public affairs is busy shouting his 
dismissal from rooftops to the media.

'There is (an) ongoing appeal against his conviction and Dr Dizaei has issued employment tribunal proceedings against the MPS with regard to his treatment scheduled to be heard in February 2013.'

Dizaei was originally convicted of perverting the course of justice and 
misconduct in public office in February 2010 and jailed for four years.

His conviction was quashed last May after doubts emerged about the 
immigration status of his Iraqi accuser, Waad al-Baghdadi, who was also 
exposed as a benefit fraudster.

But a second jury unanimously found him 
guilty of the same offences in February, condemning him to a 
further spell behind bars.

He was released from Wandsworth Prison in south-west London in February on
a Home Detention Curfew, three months before the mid-point of his 
sentence.

Prior to being jailed for a second time, Dizaei was on full pay. After 
winning a retrial but still to clear his name, he was reinstated, 
quickly suspended on full pay and then awarded up to £180,000 in back 
pay and allowances as he awaited the new hearing.

His salary was stopped on the day he was convicted again before he was formally sacked today.

Dizaei emerged unscathed from a series of inquiries over the years, 
including an undercover operation examining claims of corruption, fraud,
dishonesty and appalling threats to an ex-girlfriend.

But the attempt to frame Mr al-Baghdadi, who pestered him for payment 
over a website he was designing for Dizaei, exposed him as a violent 
bully and liar.
