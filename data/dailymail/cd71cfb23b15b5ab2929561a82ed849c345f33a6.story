Tragic: Ollie Floyd was weeding the fairways at Celtic Manor Resort golf course in Newport, South Wales, with his father (pictured together) when his buggy crashed into the freezing water

This is the 20-year-old groundsman who was killed at one of Britain's top golf courses yesterday when his buggy plunged into a lake.

Ollie Floyd was weeding the fairways at Celtic Manor Resort in Newport, South Wales, with his father when their buggy crashed into the freezing water, trapping him inside.

Staff on the 'Twenty Ten Course', which hosted the Ryder Cup in 2010, dived in after the vehicle and managed to drag Ollie to the water's edge.

Emergency services were called and Mr Floyd, from Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire, was taken to Newport's Royal Gwent Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

His 46-year-old father, was also in the 'agricultural spraying vehicle' when it rolled into the lake and was taken to hospital to be treated for minor injuries. 

The pair worked on sports pitches and stadiums across the country - including Celtic Manor Resort and the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff - for Complete Weed Control Limited.

Staff who had jumped in to rescue Ollie were treated at the site.  

Ollie, who lived with his mother Hayley, 47, was today remembered by members of Ross-On-Wye Rugby Football Club, where he played alongside his father and brother, Tom. 

Chairman Paul Haley said: 'We are absolutely shocked and devastated. His dad and granddad, they have both been players at the club.

'I'm struggling, it’s very difficult. We are just waiting for someone to ring up and say it’s not true.' 

Ollie had been named 'most committed player of the season' shortly before his death.

A club spokesman said: 'It’s with great sadness that I have to inform you that Ollie Floyd was killed in a tragic accident this morning.

'On your behalf I would like to offer our condolences to Haley, Nick, Tom and all members of the family. A great friend and clubman to us all.' 

The Celtic Manor Resort will now be the subject of an investigation carried out by Gwent Police and Newport City Council’s health and safety team. 

A golf club spokesman said yesterday: 'The Celtic Manor Resort can confirm that a serious accident took place on its Twenty Ten Course at around 7.50am.

'The accident resulted in one person being taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital in a critical condition. 

'The incident is currently subject to an investigation which the Celtic Manor Resort is co-operating with fully.

'The Resort is unable to comment further at this stage. Our thoughts are with the family at this difficult time.' 

A spokesman for South Wales Fire and Rescue Service said its crews had 'assisted paramedics in assessing members of staff who had gone in to the water to assist with the rescue'.

A spokesman for Gwent Police said: 'A 20 year old man has died following an incident this morning on the grounds of the Celtic Manor Resort at a lake on the Twenty Ten Course.

'Another 46 year old man, also from the Ross-on-Wye area, who was also in the vehicle was taken to the hospital with minor injuries where he remains receiving treatment.
