Two Royal Navy helicopters came within 50ft of colliding on a night exercise because the pilots couldnâ€™t see properly through their night vision goggles.

A report which revealed the near-miss described it as 'a very serious incident that could potentially have ended with fatalities.'

The near-tragedy happened three miles north
of Glastonbury, Somerset, at 11.10pm on June 4 this year.

The two Lynx 8 helicopters were returning to a nearby base, Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton, at 80 knots (92mph) just 200ft above the ground as part of a night flying exercise.

Both crews were concentrating on climbing above power pylons which lay ahead of them in the darkness.

But they were wearing NVG visors, which restricted their field of view more than other, more modern equipment.

That prevented the four crew members from seeing flashing safety beacons which were fitted to each of the grey camouflaged aircraft.

The two crews only spotted each other with seconds to spare, when one crew member grabbed the 
controls and took violent evasive action, according to the near-miss report by the UK Airprox Board (UKAB).

The helicopters were separated by just 20ft vertically and 50ft horizontally.

'Collision was avoided by a very late sighting by one of the aircrew and his quick reactions to take control,' said the report. 'There were no barriers left after this.

'The overriding contributory factor 
was deemed to be the complexity of low-level night vision goggle 
operations and the associated restricted field of view.'

'Wider field of view night vision goggles would naturally contribute to improved aircrew peripheral vision.

'Whilst
this requires an equipment upgrade such systems are available today and
arguably would have enabled the crews, in this case, to have seen each 
other at a much earlier stage.'

Their ageing aircraft, from a family which has been in use for almost 40 
years, were also not fitted with widely-used collision warning systems 
which would have sounded an alarm.

The report added the incident would probably never have happened it the helicopters had traffic warning systems.

The Lynx is part of the Fleet Air Arm which served in the Falklands, both Gulf Wars and is currently the scourge of drugs traffickers and pirates.

It is due to be phased out and replaced with new Wildcats within a few years.

The UKAB said that the safety margins were so far below normal it 'only just stopped short of actual collision', and designated it a category A incident - the highest risk short of an actual crash.

The incident came amid an apparent spate of helicopter crashes this year.

In August four oil workers were killed after the Super Puma helicopter carrying them to a rig near Shetland ditched into the North Sea.

Workers were scared to take the daily round trip after the accident and the Super Puma fleet was grounded. A Civil Aviation Authority report later ruled a technical fault was not to blame.

Last month, an MH-60S Knighthawk helicopter used by the US Navy crashed into the Red Sea, sparking a frantic search for two missing crew members.

And in January, experienced air ambulance and film stunt pilot Pete Barnes, 50, was killed when the helicopter he was flying crashed into a crane on the St George Wharf tower, which was still under construction in central London.

The burning wreckage also killed pedestrian Matthew Wood, 39, from Sutton, Surrey, as he walked on the busy street below.

The Lynx fleet itself was almost completely grounded in 2000 after a Lynx used by the Dutch Navy crashed. It took two years to get the fleet flying again after 44 of the helicopters had to have new titanium rotor heads installed.
