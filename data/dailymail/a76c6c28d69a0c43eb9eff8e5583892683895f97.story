Diego Maradona has agreed that Lionel Messi is now his heir.

Former Tottenham legend and Argentine World Cup winner Ossie Ardiels believes Messi is now better than Maradona and even Pele.

'For some time I have thought that Diego could never be surpassed, and nor could Pele, but no longer. I would now say that Lionel Messi will go down in history as the No.1 player of all time, the best that there ever was,' said Ardiles.

Right path: Lionel Messi has inspired Argentina to two victories in Brazil

'Yes, I would now say that Lionel is the very best, but of course you would wonder just how much better Maradona or Pele would have been if they had the advantage of such advancements in the game.'

But for many it will only be if Messi can lead Argentina to victory at a World Cup that he will be regarded in such esteem as Maradona.

After flopping at the last World Cup, Messi is on the right path having scored two superb individual goals to seal successive victories and could well further stamp his personality on this tournament against Nigeria.

In that respect, Messi has started better in terms of goals than Maradona did in 1986, who only scored one goal at the group stage in a draw against Italy.

He then struck his two 'beast and beauty' goals against England in the quarter final and then two more in the 2-0 semi final win over Belgium, although he didn’t score in the 3-2 final win over West Germany.

Karim Benzema will he hoping to fill his boots in the race for the golden boot.

The Real Madrid striker, who could be up for grabs this summer, currently trails Brazil's Neymar, who is now on four, by one goal.

But if France stay in free-scoring mode against Ecuador then Benzama would expect to be on the score sheet.

If he does strike he will become only the second Frenchman to score four goals at a single World Cup.

But he will have a long way to go to catch the last French striker to pass that mark. He was Just Fontaine who in the 1958 finals hit a staggering 13 goals which remains the record.

Nigeria need a point against Argentina to guarantee a place in the knockout stage.

If defensive resolve is required then Nigeria have shown it thus far.

Their goalkeeper Vincent Enyema of Lille in France is so far the top graded keeper in the tournament according to FIFA stats which give a 100 per cent record with two clean sheets and eight saves.

Iran need to beat Bosnia Herzegovina and hope Nigeria slip up to progress.

The Iranians, managed by former Manchester United assistant coach Carlos Queiroz, certainly have the mentality and tactical nous to take it to the wire.

Their midfield general Javad Nekounam will be key, not least given his vast experience. This will be his 143rd cap which puts him 21st in the all time list.

Experience: Iran's Javad Nekounam will win his 143rd cap against Bosnia on Wednesday

The most capped player of all time is Ahmed Hassan of Egypt with 184. Spain keeper Iker Cassillas is Europe’s most capped  player with 156, Germany’s Lothar Mattheus, who played in five World Cups, is Europe’s most capped outfield players with 150.

The notion that Premier League referees are more lenient than their continental counterparts and turn a blind eye to certain types of robust challenges does not appear to stand up  judging on how games have been officiated far.

A perception that in the main refs at the World Cup have, where possible, let games flow and have not been rushed into issuing cards is backed up by statistics.

Last season in the PL the ratio of yellow cards was one per 6.8 fouls. Thus far in Brazil it has been one booking per 10.8 fouls.

One to watch: Switzerland need to beat Honduras and hope that France remain focused and don’t lose to Ecuador.

Watch out for left footed striker Xherdan Shaqiri who can fire Switzerland into the next phase. The Bayern Munich player has long been admired by several PL clubs and could be up for grabs  following the arrival this summer of Poland’s Robert Lewansowski.

I say: There are many reasons why England flopped at this World Cup.

But one of the most obvious but least debated is the simple fact England didn’t score enough goals.

There can be endless debates about tactics, pass completions, defensive frailties, sport psychology and so on but if the you don’t stick the ball in the old onion bag …and there were ample chances  against Italy Uruguay and Costa Rica …you are not going to win. And so England come home with just one point.

Two goals - equalisers by Daniel Sturridge v Italy and Wayne Rooney v Uruguay - was never going to be enough. Cameroon return home with the worst record just one, while Ecuador and Bosnia are both on one goal but can add to their total.

It’s enhances the argument that Roy Hodgson should have taken at least one more striker…Jermain Defoe or Andy Carroll… especially as Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was never going to be fit.

Grounded: Andy Carroll was not included in England's squad for the finals

World Cup Moment: France have so far surprised given the downbeat attitude of manager Didier Deschamps ahead of the tournament.

They might not be quite the elegant side of 1998 but they have been full of attacking menace and goals.

For me the most memorable moment of their 3-0 final win over Brazil was Zinedine Zidane’s 27th minute bullet header.
