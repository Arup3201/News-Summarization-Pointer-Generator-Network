A Florida businessman who bought a prime lakefront lot for $760,000 claims he was shocked to learn after building his dream home that the land was saddled with a $12.6million debt.

The debt prevents him from ever seeing a cent if he sells the property and has sparked a fierce legal battle.

Gary Jensen, a successful Orlando builder, is now suing a real estate broker and the high-powered lawyer who drew up the legal papers, claiming they knew - or should have known - about the massive lien filed against the property.

Not a penny: Home builder Gary Jensen will not receive a penny if he sells his $3.45million dream home because of a $12.6million debt on the property

Mr Jensen invested at least $1.4million in the property when he built this sprawling 85,000-square-foot one-story mansion. It features an in-ground swimming pool, three bedrooms and gated driveway

Phillip Kobrin, and the lawyer, Todd Kobrin, are a father-son team. They are also the men who sold the property and, Mr Jensen alleges in his lawsuit, they were involved in the deal that led to the massive debt being placed on the land.

Mr Jensen is seeking $12.6million in damages, plus interest. He says he wants to pay off the $12.6million lien so he can sell the house and be done with it, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

The defendants in the case declined comment to the Sentinel. They could not be reached by MailOnline Sunday.

Mr Jensen bought the two-acre parcel, which sits in a wealthy subdivision on Lake Berry in Winter Park, in 2011 for $760,000. He then invested at least $1.4million on a home.

The sprawling 8,500-square-foot one-story mansion features a massive in-ground swimming pool, three bedrooms, an outdoor summer kitchen and a driveway guarded by a gate.

In the lawsuit, Mr Jensen, who owns contracting company Terra Firma Construction Management Inc.,says the property is now worth $3.45million.

Mr Jensen said he bought title insurance, but the policy only covers the cost of the land - not the massive $12.6million debt encumbered on the property

The house has lakefront access and is situated in an upscale subdivision of Winter Park, an Orlando suburb

Mr Jensen said he has title insurance, but it only covers the cost of the land - a fraction of the massive lien. The debt against the property was laid down in a neighboring county, so a routine title search in Orange County - home of Winter Park - didn't show an encumbrances.

If Mr Jensen sells, the entire sum will go toward the $12.6million debt against the property.

As with most bad land deals in Florida, this one traces its origins back to the collapse of the U.S. housing market.Â 

The property originally belonged to Albert Kodsi, a major Florida real estate developer. In 2008, Mr Kodsi borrowed $650,000 from Phillip and Todd Kobrin and offered the two-acre Winter Lake parcel as collateral, the Sentinel reports.

When Mr Kodsi's $20million hotel redevelopment project in Daytona Beach failed in the housing crash, a judge entered a $12.6million judgement against him and placed a lien against the property, according to the newspaper.

Mr Kodsi's lawyer declined comment to the Sentinel. He could not be reached by MailOnline Sunday.

Because Mr Kodsi also owed the Kobrins money from the $650,000 loan, they took ownership of the parcel - and the $12.6million lien along with it, the Sentinel reports.

The lawsuit alleges that because the Kobrins were involved with Mr Kodsi, they had to have known about the debt when they sold the land to Mr Jensen. Or or they didn't, Mr Jensen alleges, they should have.
