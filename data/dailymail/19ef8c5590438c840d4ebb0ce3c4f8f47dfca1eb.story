This is not your typical hot air balloon ride.

While most tourists enjoy a tranquil glide through the air while enjoying the sights below, these thrill-seekers instead decided to throw themselves out of a hot air balloon basket and swing to a second  balloon while attached to a rope.

YouTube superstar Devin 'Supertramp' Graham and his team filmed the exhilarating moment which combined two seemingly tame activities, the hot air balloon ride and the rope swing, to create one heart-stopping stunt.

Cinematographer Devin, 31, specialises in extreme sports and adventure videos, pulling off mind-blowing stunts each week in videos watched by over 2.6million subscribers.

In this video, Devin filmed his team swinging 180ft though the air and to the ground in the desert outside Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 29.

The jumpers each held GoPro cameras, capturing the stunt from different perspectives, while a helicopter was also used to take a bird's eye view of the balloons.

The videos were made in collaboration with the Citi Double Cash Card, with the idea of combining two fun activities into a double stunt made epic.

The thrilling video has had over 420,000 views since being uploaded one week ago. 

A behind-the-scenes clip shows Devin and his team setting up for the shoot in the desert, with some team members camping outside in the near-freezing temperature to protect the equipment.

On his blog, Devin, from Salt Lake City, writes that they ran into a number of obstacles when pulling together the stunt, and had to change the plan a few times.

His original concept was to create a 'Tarzan' scenario, with the crew swinging from rope to rope across multiple hot air balloons, but it was deemed impossible to pull off. 

That's when the idea of a rope swing created by jumping out of one hot air balloon while attached to another was born, with the plan calling for the team members to swing into a lake below. But the shoot had to be moved to the desert when the weather conditions became too windy.

Despite the obstacles, the end result is undeniably spectacular.
