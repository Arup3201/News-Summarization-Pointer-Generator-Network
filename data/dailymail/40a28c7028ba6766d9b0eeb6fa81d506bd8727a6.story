Video on demand service Netflix will bring Disney magic to Australia when it launches in March, it has been confirmed.

Hit movies and TV shows from the creators of Mickey Mouse, including box office hit Frozen, Cars, Monsters Inc. and UP, will be available to watch via the streaming service at a cost of $9.99 per month.

However, Netflix, which is set to launch in Australia and New Zealand on March 31, has still not confirmed if original award-winning shows House Of Cards and Orange Is The New Black will be part of the deal for viewers in the two countries.

‘In today’s world, subscription over-the-top services play a critical role in media consumption, and we’re delighted to bring our top-quality films and television series to these fans.’

Netflix Australia won't confirm if the two popular shows will be available and it's believed to be because of licensing agreements already in place with pay TV operator Foxtel.
