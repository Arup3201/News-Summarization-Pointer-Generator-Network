When 15-Grand Slam winner, Serena 
Williams, smashed her racket in anger at losing to a U.S. teenager in 
the Australian Open, eyebrows were raised about the tennis star's sudden
lack of sportsmanship.

However, the number 3 seed was suffering from more than a dent in her pride at Melbourne Park.

Early this morning Williams posted a picture of her hugely swollen right ankle on Twitter - an injury she picked up in her first round match - aggravated in her three-set loss to Sloane Stephens.

What a racket: Serena Williams created a scene breaking her racket as she lost the Australian Open quarter-final to Sloane Stephens. It emerged she was badly injured

The tennis ace also went on to suffer a back injury in the match against the upcoming 19-year-old fellow American.

So when she was caught on a court-side microphone muttering the contest had been 'the worst two weeks' and she was ultimately fined $1,500 for smashing her racket - it was more than a world-champion sized tantrum.

Last night the star tweeted her fans with the image of the nasty injury simply entitled: 'Ouch!'

She was outplayed by the 19-year-old in the quarter-finals losing 6-3, 5-7, 4-6.

'I've had a tough two weeks between the ankle ... and my back, which started hurting,' she said after the game. 'A lot of stuff.'

Got her back up: Serena Williams appeared angry following her defeat, left. She later blamed a back injury she was treated for on-court, right, and her swollen ankle she tweeted about today

Fighting fit: Sloane Stephens was overwhelmed by her win against her childhood hero Serena Williams. She lost in today's semi-finals but is upbeat about her next competition

'I'm almost relieved that it's over,' she added. 'I've been thrown a lot of (curve) balls these two weeks.'

And it appears she wasn't making up her misery just to save face following her first loss since August 17.

Today Stephens lost out in the semi-finals to World Number 1 Victoria Azarenka, who like Williams called a medical time-out but this time over a rib injury.

However, unlike her opponents, Stephens, who now moves up to 17 in the WTA rankings is feeling good - even in spite of her loss.

'I'm obviously coming out of the Australian summer with amazing momentum, knowing I can pretty much hang in there with anybody and even beat some of the best players,'' she said. "It's definitely a good feeling.'

Stephens said had a picture of Williams on 
her bedroom wall growing up and she joked: 
'I will have to put up a poster of myself now!'
