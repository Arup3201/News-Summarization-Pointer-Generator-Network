A teenager spent a week on a drip and had to have part of her ear removed after a cheap piercing became badly infected. 

Bianca Hart, 18, had a stud put in the top of her right ear in a quick £10 procedure before starting university, but began suffering crippling pains days later.

Infection set in and despite attempts to remedy it, the student from Chelmsford, Essex, ended up having surgery after it ate into her cartilage.

And doctors told her she was lucky her ear was saved at all.

Bianca Hart, 18, just after she had her ear pierced, left, and right, swollen before surgeons had to operate on it

Miss Hart, who studies psychology and criminology at Nottingham Trent University, had her piercing done at the end of August at the Lady Pirates parlour in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, shortly before starting university.

Within days, however, it was hurting her, so she returned to the parlour to have the original replaced with a small bar.

Miss Hart said: 'I went back to the shop when it didn't settle and she said it "needed to breathe".

'She took it out and put a tongue bar in which was apparently the worst thing she could have done.'

But that failed to solve the problem, and a fortnight later, Miss Hart was rushed to A&E for emergency surgery.

She said: 'The pain was just so much, it was excruciating, and I was throwing up constantly.  The piercing was disgusting as well - it was bright purple and oozing pus.'

Surgeons cut open her ear in an attempt to ease the pressure, but instead it revealed that the infection had eaten into the cartilage, and they had to cut off the top part of her ear.

'They operated and found that my cartilage had just disintegrated,' Miss Hart said.  'The surgeons had to build my ear again.'

The first year student was put on an antibiotic drip for a week and then arrived for Freshers' Week with a bandage around her head.  

Miss Hart, who had to start university in Nottingham with a bandage around her head, will be scarred for life

She said: 'I had to turn up at university with a bandage on my head.  It was so embarrassing, especially when you're worried about making friends.

'I can't even look at my ear because it just reminds me of that horrible time I went through. 

The experience - which doctors said nearly resulted in Miss Hart developing septicaemia - has now put her off piercings for life.

'I would never have had this done if I had known,' she said.

Miss Hart's father, Greg Hart, 50, who runs a catering business, has now called in the local authority to investigate.

He said: 'The surgeon said it was the worst case they had ever seen - in the end they were lucky to save her ear.

'It will never look the same and has scarred her for life. We just don't want this to happen to everyone else.'

He added: 'We got told they were changing all their procedures now, but it should never have come to this.'

But the owner of the Lady Pirates parlour insisted Miss Hart caused the infection herself.

Carrie Blood said they had not had one complaint in four years, and refuted claims they had inadequate health and safety procedures.

Surgeons hoped cutting the ear would ease the pressure but found the infection was worse than they thought

She said: 'If the first thing she did was touch it when she left the shop then it is going to get infected. We can't control what they do when they leave here. 

'When we changed the bar it wasn't infected. We told her that if it was bothering her then she should take it out but she didn't.

'Everything we do is by the book.  As far as I am concerned we have done nothing wrong.'

A spokesman for Southend-on-Sea Borough Council said: 'As soon as this matter was reported to us, we began an investigation which is still ongoing.

'There are strict laws governing body piercing and we make regular checks of all establishments which offer this service.'
