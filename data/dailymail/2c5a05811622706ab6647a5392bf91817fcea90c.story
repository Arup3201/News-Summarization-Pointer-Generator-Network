The woman who claims she was sexually harassed by MP Mike Hancock yesterday won her bid to force a Lib Dem-led council to release a document which could help her to win her case.

Disclosing the document was necessary so that she could have a ‘fair hearing and a fair crack of the whip’, the High Court ruled.

The report was written by Nigel Pascoe QC, who was asked by Portsmouth City Council to investigate the allegations for code of conduct proceedings.

The woman, a constituent and a young mother, says Mr Hancock made ‘unwelcome sexual approaches’.

Mr Hancock, 67, from Fareham, Hampshire, denies the allegations. He was suspended from the Lib Dems on Wednesday and now sits as an independent MP.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has faced claims that he and his party suppressed the scandal.

But he said yesterday he was ‘appalled’ by the allegations and insisted: ‘I acted as soon as I was given notice that legal proceedings were happening.’

But Mr Hancock’s alleged victim has accused the party of sweeping it under the carpet. She said that the Lib Dems could have dealt with her complaint back in 2010, when she had first come forward.

Michael Lawther, a solicitor at Portsmouth council, said the hearing cost the council £700. Costs were awarded to the alleged victim.

Meanwhile the Lib Dems are hoping to broker peace talks in the dispute between Lord Rennard and the women who accused him of being a sex pest  in the coming days.
