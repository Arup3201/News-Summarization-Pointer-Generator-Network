The family of an 11-year-old boy are suing the Publix grocery chain, saying the child was allergic to nuts and died from a severe reaction after eating a cookie despite a worker's assurance it was safe.

The lawsuit says Derek Landon Wood of Alabama died in June 2014 shortly after eating a chocolate chip cookie purchased at a Publix Super Market in Clarksville.

The boy, who was visiting family in Tennessee, was allergic to tree nuts.

The lawsuit, which was filed on March 20, says the store bakery did not post warnings about ingredients or possible cross-contamination, and the mother bought the cookie only after a worker assured her it was safe.

Derek's family filed the lawsuit on Friday in federal court in Nashville and are seeking unspecified amount of damages.

They claim the grocery store should be declared liable under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act 'to raise awareness of potential fatal food allergies in American children.'

The family also claims Publix was negligent for not labeling its baked goods and identifying any allergens, for not posting signs warning of potential allergens or cross-contamination and for not properly training employees to respond to questions about food allergens.

A Publix spokeswoman declined to comment on the litigation but said in an email that the company posts allergen information at its bakeries.

'We were very sorry about the loss if this young man. Our prayers go out for him and his family,' a Publix Super Markets spokesperson told USA Today.

Landon's mom bought an unlabeled 'Chocolate Chew' cookie that he wanted. 

The mother specifically asked a Publix employee at the bakery counter whether the cookie contained any tree nuts. 

'The Publix associate affirmatively said the Chocolate Chew contained no tree nut ingredients,' the lawsuit states.

Landon ate the cookie back at his aunt's house and then went into anaphylactic shock.

He died despite being immediately being given medication by his mother and efforts by emergency medical personnel and doctors at a local hospital.
