It is the dead of night on the edge of the Arctic Circle, and the sun is about to kiss the horizon.

Much of Iceland may be sleeping, but 20 minutes past midnight represents the limit of the sun’s descent on this clear June night. In an hour, the sky’s amber glow will be supplanted by beams of white light which last for nearly 24 hours in summertime.

The villages are silent and the roads dead – except for a faint, rolling mass of mist, which drifts over from the wetlands, across the tarmac and down the hill towards the cliffs and the north Atlantic.

On the road to the end of the earth: Iceland bathes in an ethereal light in high summer

I am in a minibus, having taken a 40-minute flight from Reykjavik to the tiny city of Akureyri on Iceland’s northern shore.

My stomach is swimming with coffee – an insurance policy against the lateness of the moment. For I am here to explore Iceland’s wonders while the rest of the world sleeps – to see what the witching hour looks like when the sun never sets.

Welcome to the white nights of northern Iceland: the land of the midnight sun.

Road to somewhere: The Route 1 'Ring Road' runs around Iceland, linking the remote north to Reykjavik

First, a little science:

Our planet’s 23-degree tilt robs the polar extremities of that which most of the world takes for granted: the continuous, inevitable oscillation of night and day.

For those countries at the northernmost and southernmost edges of the globe, summer is a season of unremitting exposure to the sun.

At the North Pole, it does not set for six months. Instead, it steadily spirals higher above the earth, before eventually beginning its descent and disappearing for the rest of the year.

And even though Akureyri lies 60 miles below the Arctic Circle, it too experiences one near-endless day that stretches from the earliest minutes of June to the dying embers of July.

Anton Freyr Birgisson – the son of a generation of farmers from nearby Lake Myvatn, and my guide through this twilight realm – is accustomed to the unbroken light.

A place lost in its own little realm: The fishing town of Akureyri sits on Iceland's northern shore

‘It is no problem for me,’ he says, as he steers the minibus out of Akureyri, and across the dam that bridges the noiseless fjord. ‘I sleep with the curtains open – but I bet you will find it strange. My wife is from Estonia and she can’t sleep.’

It is 10pm, and we are driving east. The road climbs above the fjord’s eastern shore, passing a steaming stream of hot water. Then, through lengthening purple shadows, it crosses lava fields towards the cloud of spray on the horizon.

This is Goðafoss. It is among the most spectacular of Iceland’s waterfalls.

Today, it is raging.

In the depths of winter, its 12-metre-high torrents are frozen solid. But beneath the midnight sun, the snow atop the mountains is finally melting – rolling down the valley in a tumult of sound and spray. In-mid June, the waters are at their most ferocious.

Halting above the horizon: During June and July, the sun does not set on Iceland

It was in this maelstrom, in around 1000AD, that modern Iceland was born.

Until 700AD the island had been an empty rock at the top of the world, uninhabited for 17million years. Explorers knew it was there, but believed it to be the domain of diabolical dog-headed people. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the rest of the planet stayed away.

When the first settlers eventually arrived, they brought arguments about power, wealth and religion – and, by the turn of the 11th century, civil war between pagans and Christians looked inevitable. Only when the chief ‘law-speaker’ Þorgeir – a pagan – converted, was conflict averted. On his way home from the parliament of elders which passed for rule in Iceland at the time, he neared the waterfall – and cast his abandoned idols into its depths. Thus the name: Goðafoss, the Waterfall of the Gods.

We leave the road at Goðafoss, and turn north to race the sun towards the horizon.

Taking a shine to the surroundings: Chris glimpsed the midnight sun from the very northern edge of Iceland

Anton takes us over lava fields where astronauts once trained for the moon landings, through the fishing town of Husavik – now sleeping in the midnight gloom.

Then we reach the cliffs at Tjörnes, just in time to see the sun lower its brow to meet the ocean. It is twenty past midnight.

Puffins nesting in the rocks sleep without murmur, and the only movement is the bobbing head of a seal, emerging intermittently at the foot of the cliffs.

From the edge of the sheer drop to the black sand at the water’s edge, there is a near-unimpeded view to the Arctic Circle. The only distraction is the faint blur of the island of Grímsey on the horizon.

This lost outcrop is Iceland’s most northerly point – home to just 100 people and a million sea birds.

Roar: Legend has it the Godafoss waterfall was created when an Icelandic leader cast away his pagan idols

Legend insists that it was created by three nocturnal trolls who were trying to split Iceland in two.

They were (for reasons that remain unclear) cutting a trench between the mainland and the northwest peninsula, but were so focused on the job that they forgot about the rising sun – and, as dawn turned red, were turned to stone.

The female troll, realising too late their mistake, flung her shovel in anger, and it landed in the ocean, becoming this new island at the world’s end.

An appealing story. There are many of them up here. Iceland is a country of myths and legends, of giant trolls, ghosts and Huldufólk (secret people) who are believed to live in the lava fields – mischievous souls who dislike crosses, churches and electricity, and who can wreck construction projects if their homes are disturbed.

The more scientific narrative of Iceland’s formation is only a little less fantastical.

It sits on the junction of two tectonic plates – the Mid-Atlantic ridge – meaning that at certain points you can stand across continents, with one foot in North America and one in Europe.

Geysers snort from beneath the surface, steam belches from the earth, and, in the hills above Lake Myvatn, the eggy smell of sulphur hangs in the air.

Caught in an unusual light: During high summer, the Icelandic sunshine plays tricks on the camera

Volcanoes, extinct and idle, dominate the landscape, and the scars of their fury are everywhere.

We drive east past huge tears in the soil – fractures of earthquakes past – and then, after 30 minutes, approach the horseshoe-shaped, 1km-wide canyon of Ásbyrgi, the product of a catastrophic glacial flood just 3,000 years ago.

Or if you prefer the legend, from the hoofprint of Odin’s eight-legged horse.

Ásbyrgi is the capital of the Huldufólk – who supposedly live in the cracks in the 100m-high cliffs.

Their Queen dwells in the rocks at the canyon’s head, but only emerges when its waterfall flows. This early morning, it is bathed in sunlight. But there is no water.

From the peaceful emptiness of Ásbyrgi, we turn to the roar of Dettifoss. The biggest waterfall in Europe, it is often cast as ‘The Beast’ to Goðafoss’s ‘Beauty’.

Fire in the sky: In such light, it is easy to believe in the idea of Iceland as home of the mischievous 'Huldufólk'

It is easy to see why. This is a monster waterfall.

It is approaching 5am when Anton pulls the minibus up the dirt track to the car park. We are cold and tired. But we drag ourselves across black rocks and look down on an almost impossible volume of milky-white water, which plunges 50 metres into a burst of spray.

There are no handrails, and you can stand scarily close to the torrents – almost dizzy at the power of the water. We linger, staring, until we feel the sun returning to full-strength. Then it is back to the bus for another shot of caffeine and the long drive home.

Across the island, everyone is just waking up. They missed quite a show.

Icelandic operator Saga Travel (www.sagatravel.is) runs Midnight Sun tours - from 49500 Icelandic krona (£255) per person.

WOW Air (0118 3218384; www.wowair.co.uk) flies between London Gatwick and Reykjavik ten times per week - prices from £49 each way.

Flights from Reykjavik to Akureyri with Air Iceland (www.airiceland.is) start from £65 each way.
