A crisp white shirt is a wardrobe essential, but its pale color means that one must typically wear a frumpy nude bra beneath.

That's not the only option, though, argue the experts at lingerie boutique Intimacy. In fact, one can wear a racy red bra under a white shirt or tee, and no-one will be any the wiser.

Nicole Willis, bra fit stylist at the store on Madison Avenue in New York, tells MailOnline that the hue works well with many skin tones - but the darker one's skin, the better it works.

'It's really a fun way to get you out of 
the routine of wearing boring, nude bras and incorporate some colors 
back into your wardrobe to wear on a more regular basis,' she said.

Staff at the chain, which is affiliated
 with the UK's venerable Rigby & Peller, swear by the idea - to the 
degree that they posed for a photo to prove it.

As promised, the only glimpses of red seen are the straps the ladies chose to expose.

Ms Willis also shared her words of wisdom on the bras that every woman should own.

Of the four styles that she most recommends, she says that a plunge bra is vital for when one is wearing V-necks and wrap dresses.

A lace bra, she continues, boasts form and function as it is best for centering and lifting the breasts under fitted garments like button-down shirts and tailored dresses.

Other essentials include a perfectly-fitting strapless bra and the all-important sports bra.

'Women should have the most breast 
support while working out and should never have to wear two bras to get 
it,' Ms Willis said.
