Louise Redknapp has offered her tips on how you can achieve a flawless look by day and night when enjoying a holiday in the sun.

The mother-of-two, 38, has ensured the looks are easy to replicate when space is limited in your suitcase as it involves using just five products.

The singer-turned-presenter has created a beauty tutorial video with make-up artist, Kim Jacob, with whom she has founded the cosmetic company, Wild About Beauty.

In it, the pair reveal how you can go from the beach to the bar in a few simple steps.

To begin, Kim blends a sheer glow moisture tint with SPF 20 onto Louise's face using a cosmetic sponge.

She explains: 'This is fantastic if you're sitting on the beach as there's some sun protection factor in there. It's also really hydrating with extracts of winter cherry.'

Glowing: The make-up artist then adds a bronzer and recommends avoiding products with glitter during the day

Next she applies bronzer over the cheekbones, temples and chin to create a glowing but matt look.

She said: 'Use a bronzer because you don't want any shimmer on the beach so avoid colours with any glitter in.'

Kim completes the day time look by adding some hydrating lip balm.

She comments of the result modelled by Louise: 'It gives a quick, easy look of being nice and glowing that is fantastic for the beach as we've got SPF and moisturiser on.'

Ready to hit the bar: Louise's beauty tutorial reflects her 'less is more' approach to make-up

Kim then reveals how 'with a few steps you can be ready to go from the beach straight to the bar.'

She
uses an eyeshadow pencil on Louise's upper and lower lash line and 
blends it in to look more natural, adding a flick to the outside edge of
the upper lid to make the eyes look bigger.

She then finishes by adding mascara.

The simple, easy to achieve look reflects Louise's ethos that 'less is more' when it comes to make-up.

She told the MailOnline this week: 'My tips would be to look after your skin: although my skincare routine is simple, I believe it can still be really effective.

'People don't need to spend hundreds of pounds on products and spend hours on a routine - sometimes all you need is a good moisturiser.

'Keep your make-up simple. The older we get, less is definitely more.'
