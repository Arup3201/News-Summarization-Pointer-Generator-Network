The Vietnamese traffic police force is undergoing a major makeover - starting with its waistline.

From now on short or overweight traffic officers in the Vietnamese capital of Hanoi will be made to get fit in a bid to improve the force's poor public image.

Hanoi traffic police chief Colonel Dao Vinh 
Tang said tubby officers will be deployed out of sight: 'Little officers or those with too big a belly will be moved 
to work in offices so they do not come into contact with the public.'

Time for a makeover: The Vietnamese public hold their traffic police in low esteem, so in a bid to win them over they will now be either made to lose weight or face a job away from public view

Inspectors have been monitoring officers
on duty to identify the worst offenders.

It has not yet been specified what the new height and weight requirements will be, but those officers deemed overweight will now undergo regular physical training to stop them piling on the pounds.

Vietnam is not the only country cracking down on chubby policemen.

As global obesity rates have soared in recent years, countries 
including the UK, Mexico and South Africa have introduced similar measures to 
help keep their police officers trim.

In Britain, the Metropolitan Police are now faced with fitness tests and possible pay cuts after it was discovered one in five of them was obese.

In South Africa, officers were told in 2010 that they all had to fit into a new one-size uniform by the end of the year. If they needed a larger size then they could expected to lose their jobs.

More gravely, the Hanoi traffic police has a reputation for corruption and abuse, as well as its unappealing appearance.

The Hanoi traffic police was voted one of the 'most corrupt' institutions in Vietnam according to a recent World Bank-funded survey.

Lose weight or get a desk job: Traffic police in Hanoi will have to watch their weight to make sure they are presentable in public

Public relations drive: The Hanoi traffic police began recruiting women in 2011 to work at intersection to create a 'friendly' image

This latest image initiative is part of a series of 
attempts to improve the Hanoi traffic police's faltering relationship with the public.

In 2011 officers were banned from wearing sunglasses or hiding behind trees to fine unaware motorists.

And in January 2012 female police officers were deployed at key junctions to 'cast a friendly light'.

Officers will now carry a code of conduct with them at all times to remind them how to behave politely in public.
