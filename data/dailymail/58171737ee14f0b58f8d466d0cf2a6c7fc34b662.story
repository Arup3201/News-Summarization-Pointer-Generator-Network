What's in a name? A $500,000 fine if you say it out loud, according to one misguided recording studio owner.

Bradley White found himself in hot water after he threatened a judge with a half a million dollar fine if he read his name out in court, claiming that it was copyrighted material.

Mr White, who only faced a minor marijuana charge, was thrown in jail after making the threat to Cobb County State Court judge Jason Fincher in a letter that he sent to his home.

'Mr. White is one step above anarchy in a situation like this,' Cobb Assistant District Attorney John Melvin said in court, wsbtv.com reported.

He told White 'you cannot threaten our judges in this state'.

White tried – and failed – to defend himself. He said: 'It says in the Constitution that private property shouldn't be taken for public use without just compensation. So is my name private property?'

He then admitted that sending the letter was 'the wrong move'.

His defence attorney Shannon Briley described White's legal manoeuvre as a 'misguided attempt to practice law' and 'a bad decision based on what little knowledge Mr White has of the law'.

White was jailed without bond.
