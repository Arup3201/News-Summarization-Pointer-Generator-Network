'This is my daughter's nightgown and PJ shorts. Think we're ready to start sharing clothes yet?' Frankel wrote in the Instagram post

She caused quite a stir among her online followers when she posted a picture of herself wearing her daughter's tiny Hello Kitty pajamas on Instagram a couple of months ago.

And now reality star Bethenny Frankel has felt the wrath of a Manhattan judge, who warned the mother that it's time to stop playing dress up as a four-year-old.

'No more pajamas!' Justice Ellen Gesmer warned Frankel's attorney, Allan Mayefsky in court.

The judge yesterday said Frankel had used poor judgment by posting the photograph online in July, adding that the episode was 'ridiculous', Page Six reports. 

Frankel, 43, and estranged husband Jason Hoppy were at the Manhattan courthouse as part of their lengthy divorce proceedings.

The Real Housewives star had tried to gain sole custody of her daughter  but then settled after an embarrassing trial where she called Hoppy 'white trash'.

Frankel's A-list lawyer Mr Mayefsky tried to explain his client's behavior by saying it was a joke, but Justice Gesmer responded: 'It's not a joke. Her child is not a joke'.

The judge also said she was concerned the image would be on the internet well into the years when Frankel's daughter can read and see the post and responses for herself.

The now-notorious photo showed Frankel wearing daughter Bryn's Hello Kitty pajamas with a ruffled pink top, shorts and matching slippers.

'This is my daughter's nightgown and PJ shorts. Think we're ready to start sharing clothes yet?' she wrote in the post.

The photo provoked outrage, with many of her followers claiming that Frankel, who is the author of a book called Naturally Thin, was setting a bad example for her young daughter.

One message read: 'Really don't think your sending your daughter a good message. She probably thinks wow my mom's a lot older than me and can fit my clothes, so I must be really big for my age.' 

‘Starting a complex early for your daughter,’ another commenter added of the pic.

Another message read: ‘I would just caution doing this as she gets more impressionable. She needs to develop a healthy self-image because she may not have all of your genes…and it won't be obvious to you, but it will look as though you are competing with her.’

Frankel defended herself on Twitter claiming that she was just joking and trying to please her daughter.

Bethenny Frankel was spotted carrying her  daughter, Bryn, to a ballet class in New York yesterday. Neither Frankel nor her estranged husband were in the courtroom for the discussion later in the day

Neither Frankel nor her estranged husband were in the courtroom for the discussion. Later, Frankel declined to comment.

The mom rose to fame via reality TV, first as a contestant on The Apprentice: Martha Stewart and then on The Real Housewives of New York City.

On the back of her celebrity she has written several books, including Naturally Thin: Unleash Your SkinnyGirl and The SkinnyGirl Dish: Easy Recipes for Your Naturally Thin Life. She also created the Skinnygirl cocktail company which she then sold for an estimated $100 million.

Frankel has admitted to an unhealthy relationship with food in the past. In 2010, she told Redbook magazine that she 'used to get drunk and binge on everything in the deli, and then do a juice fast or starve, then do it all over again'.
