A South Florida woman pleaded guilty to two counts of DUI manslaughter in a wrong-way highway crash that killed two 21-year-old friends.

Kayla Mendoza, who tweeted '2 drunk 2 care' before the deadly accident, apologized Wednesday to the families of the two victims as she wiped tears from her eyes.

'I know it's long overdue but I just want to tell you all how sorry I am,' she said.

She continued: 'It breaks my heart that I've broken your hearts. I'm sorry I caused all this over a stupid mistake.'

The South Florida Sun Sentinel reports Mendoza will be sentenced April 24.

Authorities say Mendoza was 20 years old and driving without a valid driver's license when she ran head-on into a car that carried Kaitlyn Ferrante and Marisa Catronio.

Catronio was pronounced dead at the scene around 2am on November 17, 2013. Ferrante was taken to hospital but died from her injuries four days later.

The best friends had been heading home to Coral Springs in Miss Ferrante's 2012 Toyota Camry after a night out when they were struck by a Hyundai Sonata driven by Mendoza, police said.

Mendoza was heading east in the westbound lanes when she slammed head-on into Catronio's red Camry driven by Ferrante, west of University Drive.

The two friends were out celebrating Miss Catronio's 21st birthday.

In the aftermath of the tragedy, it was revealed that Mendoza was not shy about her drug and alcohol use on her social media accounts.

As well as the '2 drunk 2 care' tweet sent just hours before the crash, she had also referred to herself as the 'Pothead Princess' and fired off dozens of tweets about being high and rolling joints.

On the night of the incident Mendoza was found to have a blood-alcohol level of 0.15, she was just 20 at the time and had been out boozing with co-workers from her T-Mobile sales job.

After the drinks her manager dropped her off at her car and that is when 'things went black', she said. 'I wish there was something I could say to make up for what happened,' she told Inside Edition last year.

'But no matter how many ''sorrys,'' apologies, tears I cry - no matter how much I hate myself for what happened, nothing I say will change anything.'

The crash means Mendoza is currently confined to a wheelchair because she is still recovering from injuries of her own.

Gary Catronio, Marisa's father, said that Mendoza had 'changed the lives of our family forever.'

'You took my baby girl,' he said, according to CBS Miami. ' You took my baby girl. You took my wife's best friend. You made bad decision that night. The right decision was to have a friend drive you home.'

Christine Ferrante, the mother of Kaitlyn, said: 'I don't want her to ever feel the sunshine ever. I want her to stay locked away forever.'

On the night of the crash, 20-year-old Mendoza had been drinking at the Tijuana Taxi Company in Coral Springs.

Around 8pm, she tweeted the words '2 drunk 2 care' - just hours before climbing into her car and allegedly causing the horrific wrong-way crash on the Sawgrass Expressway.
