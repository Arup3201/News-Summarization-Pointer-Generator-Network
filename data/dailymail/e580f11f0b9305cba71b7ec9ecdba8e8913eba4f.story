Roger Federer moved a step closer to a place in the semi-finals of the ATP World Tour Finals with a straight-sets win against Kei Nishikori.

In yet another one-sided singles match at London's O2 Arena, world No 2 Federer took just 69 minutes to beat US Open runner-up Kei Nishikori 6-3, 6-2 in Group B.

Anything other than an Andy Murray victory in straight sets against Milos Raonic later on Tuesday night will guarantee Federer's place in the last four with a match to spare.

Roger Federer cruised to a straight-sets victory against Japan's Kei Nishikori at the O2 Arena on Tuesday 

The Swiss is now on the brink of securing a place in the last four at the end-of-season ATP World Tour Finals

Federer's win also means that British No 1 Murray will take to the court later knowing that he has to beat Raonic to still have a chance of making the semi-finals.

Despite some early pressure from Nishikori, it was Federer who got the first break as he stepped up and hit an inside-out forehand for 3-1.

That break proved enough for Federer in the first set as the 17-time Grand Slam champion went on to close it out in 35 minutes.

Nishikori, who beat Murray in straight sets on Sunday, was no match for Federer in his second match 

Andy Murray takes to the court later on Tuesday in a bid to progress to the semi-finals of the tournament 

Nishikori continued to struggle, hitting a total of 30 unforced errors throughout the match, and Federer took full advantage with an early break in the third game of the second set.

A double fault from Nishikori handed Federer a double break for 5-2 and the Swiss served out the match with a big serve down the middle which Nishikori could not return.

Impressively it is Federer's 70th match win of the year and keeps alive his slim hopes of claiming the year-end world No 1 ranking ahead of Novak Djokovic.
