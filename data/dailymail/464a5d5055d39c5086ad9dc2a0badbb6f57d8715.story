Since its unveiling last year, Google Glass has been touted as the ultimate in hands-free technology, yet the device's head gestures, swipe bar and voice commands haven't been as easy to master as many people expected.

To solve this problem, Google has released a companion app, called MyGlass, that lets users control the device using an Android smartphone, but that ultimately does away with the hands-free functions.

The app makes it easier to navigate the device's menus, simpler to take photos, read emails, add content to Google+ and call contacts, for example.

Earlier this month the first pornographic app for 
Google Glass was released before being quickly banned.

Adult
app store MiKandi, makers of the headmounted pornography, were told by 
Google to remove the app and have been prohibited from making any such 
content.

The 'T***
& Glass,' app was downloaded 
from the developer's website by 17 Google Glass owners on its debut day,
while the site was visited by some 10,000 people.

The
app allowed viewers to browse adult content and, with Glassâ€™s 
capability of displaying and recording, the app also reportedly allowed 
users to record and upload their own intimate content.

According to the app's description, it uses Glass' screencast feature, which lets wearers share what they are seeing through the Glass visor using their Android device's screen.

It says: 'Remote control/input for screencast. Touch/swipe/tap to control the Glass UI through the screencast experience.'

The app has also been designed to make it easier to take photos and video 'surreptitiously', which may anger privacy campaigners further.

A recent study from London-based web hosting company Rackspace with the Centre for Creative 
and Social Technology (CAST) at Goldsmiths, University of London found that one in five adults in the UK wants to ban Google Glass completely because of privacy worries.

Researchers based in London surveyed 4,000 adults about the rise of wearable technology.

Despite
18 per cent of those questioned saying they plan to buy Google Glass 
when it goes on sale next year, 51 per cent expressed serious privacy 
concerns about the device and 69 per cent demanded greater regulation.

Some users have complained on Google+ that the MyGlass app doesn't work on their headset, although Engadget notes that the headset 
might need an update to allow the use of remote controls in order to work.
