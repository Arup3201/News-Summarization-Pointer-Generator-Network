ISIS extremists have cancelled all classes except religious studies in Syrian schools - with even the two-times table banned in its new curriculum.

Militants have closed all schools in the eastern area of the country pending a religious revision of the syllabus to replace the current 'infidel' education, it has been revealed.

Activists in the area say ISIS has attempted to justify the move by claiming that 'all knowledge belongs to the creator'.

Islamic State has been tightening its rules on civilian life in Deir al-Zor province, which fell under near-complete control ofthe Islamist group this summer. 

The government still
controls a military air base and other small pockets.

The announcement came after Islamic State held
a meeting with school administrators at a local mosque on the
outskirts of Deir al-Zor city, according to the British-based
Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors all sides of
the conflict.

'Islamic State informed them that teachers shall undergo a
religious instructional course for one month, and that Islamic
State officials were currently developing a new curriculum
instead of the current 'infidel' education,' the Observatory
statement said.

At the start of the academic year in September, Islamic
State revised the school curriculum in areas it controls,
eliminating physics and chemistry while promoting Islamic
teachings.

Their latest move aims to further reduce the school day into
several hours of religious learning at the expense of academic
subjects, according to local activists.

'They've announced that they will only teach religion and a
little bit of mathematics. 

'Their rationale is that all knowledge
belongs to the creator, so even the multiplication table
shouldn't be taught,' said an activist called Abu Hussein al
Deiri.

Some locals protested when the school shutdown, according to
footage posted online by activists. 

It showed two dozen girls
and boys appearing to be under 12 years of age marching with a
few female teachers clad in black veils as required by Islamic
State since the beginning of the academic year.

The children chanted: 'we want school'.

But activist al Deiri said that the protests were muted
because most people were 'too afraid to demonstrate'.

Islamic State has detained, crucified, executed and beheaded
hundreds in recent months in Deir al-Zor for 'apostasy', a crime
of which it accuses anyone who disobeys or opposes Islamic
State.
