Calls for a re-think of Britain’s controversial commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid have received a substantial boost.

The influential Financial Times newspaper says the UK should focus on the quality of projects rather than how much money is spent.

It said at the weekend that at a time of intense pressure on public finances, it was right to question David Cameron’s ‘rigid’ target – an argument made repeatedly by the Daily Mail.

The FT concluded that the target – first dreamed up in the 1960s – had ‘little relevance’ today and had been introduced by the Prime Minister to help the Tories shed their ‘nasty’ image.

The FT’s stance follows the revelation last week that Britain will spend £1billion more on foreign aid than expected over the next two years following upward revisions to UK growth.

It will give a boost to many Tory backbenchers, who are unhappy that the aid budget has been ring-fenced at a time when other elements of public spending are being hugely pared back.

This year, £11.5billion was spent by the Department for International Development on overseas aid – meeting the 0.7 per cent target. 

The target is to be maintained in future years even though the Chancellor has suggested public spending will fall to 35 per cent of GDP by 2020.

Critics have questioned whether many projects funded by overseas aid represent value for money. 

Last year, it emerged UK taxpayers had picked up a £4million bill to fund Ethiopia’s own Spice Girls, who released a string of videos that aimed to empower women in the African country.

In its leader column, the FT said: ‘Britain spends £12billion a year on overseas aid. This is a far larger sum than is disbursed by any other EU state.

‘Among the world’s big nations, only the US spends more. It is hugely to the credit of David Cameron’s government, and his Labour predecessors, that Britain maintains a noble aspiration to assist the world’s poor.

‘But at a time of intense pressure on public finances, it is reasonable to question the rigidity of the UK’s commitment to international development spending.’

The paper pointed out the target was set 50 years ago by the World Council of Churches.

‘Meeting it has helped to soften the Tories’ “nasty party” image; but in an era of tight budgets it brings painful obligations,’ it said. ‘A particular concern is that it wrongly puts the priority on the quantity of money that Britain spends on aid rather than the quality of its projects.’

The aid has ‘certainly benefited’ the UK’s international reputation, the paper concedes.

‘However, the doctrinaire commitment to the 0.7 per cent target should be reconsidered. It is a number based on outdated growth models and has little relevance today.’ 

The FT said that Britain wants to remain a major world power by spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence, at the same time as spending 0.7 per cent on foreign aid and squeezing the full amount of public spending to 35 per cent.

‘Something has to give,’ it said.

Peter Bone, Tory MP for Wellingborough, said: ‘The Financial Times are spot on. What is needed is to concentrate on quality, rather than making this political gesture.’
