A Canadian airline launching a no-frills route between North America and Europe, which could trigger a battle of budget price war on transatlantic flights.

WestJet's decision to drop prices on flights across the Atlantic could see carriers fighting over customers keen to snap up cheap tickets.

Canada's No. 2 airline will make its first trans-Atlantic flight next summer, offering daily, non-stop flights to Dublin, Ireland from St. John's, Newfoundland with its Boeing 737 aircraft.

Introductory fares mean WestJet's passengers flying from St. John's to Dublin would pay approximately £230 for a return flight, while tickets from Toronto to Dublin would cost around £360.

This could be the beginning the first stage of a longer-term plan to extend service over the Atlantic, Raymond James analyst Ben Cherniavsky wrote in a research note.

The move could compete with Europe's biggest no-frills airline, Ryanair - who have dismissed any suggestion that they would begin flights to Canada, The Independent reported.

Chris Avery, WestJet Vice-President, Network Planning, Alliances and Corporate Development said they wanted to bring discounted prices to their customers so that they can explore Europe.

He said: 'It is an exciting time for WestJet as we bring our unique brand of low fares and award-winning guest experience to a whole new market.

The no-frills deal is similar to that of Ryanair's approach, which has become Europe's biggest budget carrier

'WestJet's innovative foray into the European market represents a willingness to do what it takes to connect Canadians to the world while bringing the world to Canada. 

'From Dublin, guests can access low-cost flights to more than 100 cities in Europe.'

WestJet's first transatlantic route will cut the current travel time from St. John's to Dublin by nearly half.

It boasted that: 'in just about the same time it takes to fly from Toronto to Calgary, guests are able to experience ancient castles, cobblestone roads, and the Cliffs of Moher.'

It comes after budget carrier Norwegian announced plans to offer cheap tickets on long-haul services.

Transatlantic fares from under £150 will be on offer from Gatwick next summer, its Scandinavian boss announced.

From the beginning of July 2014, Norwegian is to fly from Gatwick to New York, Los Angeles and Fort Lauderdale in Florida.

Starting on July 3, the thrice-weekly services to New York will have an introductory one-way fare of £149, while the Los Angeles service, starting on July 2, will be twice a week with an introductory fare of £199 one way.
