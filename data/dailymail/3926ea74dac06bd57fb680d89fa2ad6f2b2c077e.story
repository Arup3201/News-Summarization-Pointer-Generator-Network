It is the 'Jewel of Japan', but Kanazawa, one of the top destinations for Japanese tourists, is barely known outside the country. Tucked between the Sea of Japan and the Japan Alps, peaks etched on the horizon like a backdrop to a stage, Kanazawa is rather off the beaten track.

That could all change when the shinkansen, Japan's famous bullet train, arrives next year at an appropriately gleaming station, rebuilt in 2005 under a dome of glassand-steel fretwork and fronted by a wooden gate shaped like a drum, with a digital clock marked out in tiny bubbling fountains.

It is a tourist attraction in its own right.

A bridge into Japan's beautiful past: Kanazawa is filled with places that exude a sense of the old Japan

Often likened to Kyoto, Japan's former capital, for its wealth of old buildings (escaping earthquakes and war damage alike - though not always the careless redevelopment of post-war years), Kanazawa was once the fourth-biggest city and flourished in feudal times.

For nearly 300 years the town was under the control of one clan, the Maeda family and, in places, you can still imagine being back a couple of centuries.

For example, the Higashi Pleasure District is the only place outside Kyoto with geishas.

The traditional architecture - low roofs of glistening curved black tiles, finely latticed frontages (easy to see out, but not in) - is unchanged. Geishas in elaborate kimonos and ghost-white faces can be seen, or heard practising their songs and instruments: the drum or the three-stringed shamisen.

At the shop where the Fukushima family has made shamisen for 130 years, visitors are allowed to practise too. In response to our summons by xylophone (serving as a bell), we were led upstairs for the obligatory green tea, before being let loose on the shamisen with instructions on how to play Sakura, Sakura (Cherry Blossom, Cherry Blossom), a simple folk song.

The Samurai (warrior) district of Nagamachi is likewise perfectly preserved.

Fashions and flavours of the Far East: Geishas in Kanazawa (left); crabs, as sold at Ohmicho market (right)

Paved lanes, surprisingly free of the usual spaghetti tangle of overhead cables, wind between ochre mud walls (the higher the wall, the higher the status).

By the 400-year-old canal is the Nomura family house, deludingly calm for the residence of a warrior, with its uncluttered interiors, tatami straw mats, sliding paper doors and meditatively peaceful garden with the inevitable carp swimming in gently trickling waters.

On display is a scroll - a thankyou letter, dated October 9, 1566, to Nomura for killing a high-ranking soldier. 'We are very happy that you brought us his head,' it says.

Across the iron bridge (identified as a 'registered national tangible cultural property') spanning one of Kanazawa's two rivers is Teramachi ('temple town'), a quiet enclave of temples and shrines, and gatherings of statues with red bibs, memorials to children.

But the biggest tourist attraction is Kenrokuen, once part of the 18th Century castle (some of which still remains), and now one of the top three gardens of Japan.

Visiting is not a peaceful experience, as large groups are led around by megaphone-wielding guides, and a photographer on a stepladder takes pictures of neatly grouped tourists.

Rather more tranquil is the smaller family-owned Gyokusenen Garden, where there are moss-covered stone lanterns, winding paths under trees, streams and waterfalls. This was the perfect setting to learn about the tea ceremony, explained gravely by Mrs Nishida in the tea house.

Taking time, keeping in step with the past: A traditional Japanese tea ceremony

Japan's tea ceremony involves confectionery, and that is entirely appropriate in Kanazawa, which is renowned for its sweets. In Higashi, we'd come across Morihachi, a sweet shop since 1625.

Kanazawa also has a reputation for more wholesome fare, especially seafood. The stalls at Ohmicho market are laden with baby aubergines, long-stalked slender mushrooms and huge melons, but mainly tuna, crabs, squid, oysters - and eels.

Eel Day was coming up (the nutrients are supposed to help you survive the heat of the summer), and long queues were kept in check by cordons. We lunched there, at Conveyor Belt Sushi where saucers of salmon, prawn, tuna and pickled plums were ferried along the counter to us.

Each place setting had pots containing soy sauce, slivers of ginger, green tea powder (next to individual taps for boiling water). It was an easier meal - though not so lavish - than the feast we had another day at a traditional restaurant, sitting for an hour on our folded knees on the floor.

At the other extreme, we were taken by a resident into a basement, past the customary models of different dishes (how else would we know what to eat?) to booths supplied with a computer tablet for ordering our food, which arrived promptly and without ceremony. When the message 'We are close time at soon' flashed up, we consulted the tablet (no need to call for the bill), paid up and left.

By this time we'd moved from the Kanazawa Grand Hotel, which more or less lived up to its name (women bowing to residents as they entered the lifts), to Ryokan Murataya, with its rows of slippers at the door and ofuro (communal bath), and a larger 'eight-tatami room' with futons.

It was an oasis of tranquillity, though situated - in something of a culture clash - just one block from a shopping street where the stores included Zara and Subway.

A version of Japan undamaged by war or modernity: Parts of Kanazawa have a visibly historic feel

The juxtaposition made Kanazawa's Unesco-designated Craft City status seem rather surreal, though Kutani porcelain and lacquer work have been made here since Maeda days. One pottery we found had exquisite little bowls costing several thousand yen.

Visitors are encouraged to participate in the local crafts, and the tourist office has sessions for making tiny dolls from cloth and tote bags from newspaper. I learned how to decorate chopsticks using gossamer-thin squares of gold leaf.

Nearly all gold leaf used in Japan comes from Kanazawa.

In one shop - offering gold-leaf body lotion and gold and silver golf balls - we were given cups of tea containing flecks of gold. It's good for health and vitality, apparently.

Upstairs were toilets tiled in gold ('Feel free to use,' said the video at the foot of the stairs) and a gallery full of the sort of thing a Bond villain might have in his home, like gold horses and dragons.

Amid all the tradition, the 21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art (opened in 2004) comes as a great surprise. Just across the road from the sculptured landscapes of Kenrokuen is a low circular glass and white building set in green lawns with installations by international artists like Olafur Eliasson. The glass walls encircling the galleries provide insight into the free public spaces that include a library, playroom and cafe with gleaming white banquettes.

There is no front or back to the museum, and with four entrances it encourages approach from all sides (no doubt a cultural statement as well as an architectural attraction).

It's a bold and brilliant attempt to assert Kanazawa as a modern town of culture as well as a venerated historic one. And it works splendidly.
