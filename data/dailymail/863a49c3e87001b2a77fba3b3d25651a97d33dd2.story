Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has cast doubt over the possibility of a Premier League player being able to reveal they are gay during their playing career.

Former Aston Villa, West Ham and Everton midfielder Thomas Hitzlsperger revealed he was gay in January but he waited until the end of his playing career before going public with the news.

Wenger says the inevitable scrutiny that would be put on an active player if they came out might discourage them from doing so.

'Because of media interest, maybe no-one will come out,' Wenger told Arsenal magazine.

'He (Hitzlsperger) could not come out during his career which means we still have some progress to make in our game.

'Hitzlsperger should not have had to wait until the end.

'But overall he should not have to come out at all because it should just be considered like anything else.

'It would be good if four, five, six people come out and after that nobody speaks about it anymore because they just think it is people who live their life like they want to live it.

'I think football is there to provoke moments of happiness, excitement and positive experiences in people, no matter where they come from, what colour skin they have, what religion they are or what their preferred sexuality is.

'It's very sad that some people think that this sport should only be reserved for those who have certain characteristics.'
