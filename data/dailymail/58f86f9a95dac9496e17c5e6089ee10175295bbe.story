Paging doctor lead-foot.

A prominent Boston surgeon with a well-documented need for speed was arrested over the weekend after police caught him driving his luxury sedan at nearly 120 miles per hour.Â 

Dr. Adel Malek, a 48-year-old Harvard University graduate and chief of neurovascular surgery at Tufts Medical Center, was clocked doing 118 mph in his 2011 Audi A8 by a police aircraft on Sunday while cruising down a New Hampshire highway.

The posted speed limit on Interstate 89 - where Malek was stopped - is 65 mph.

Lead foot: Dr. Adel Malek's driving record is nine pages long and his license has been suspended three times

This is far from the first time the doctor has been stopped for speeding - in fact, his driver's license has been suspended multiple times after accumulating dozens of speeding tickets.

According to the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, Malek's driving record is nine pages long - and that only includes violations he acquired in the Bay State.

'It shows a history of speeding violations dating back to the 1980s. The
 driver has been suspended three times for accumulating multiple 
violations over a set period of time, a 60-day suspension in 2009 for 
seven surchargeable events, a 60-day suspension in 2008 for seven 
surchargeable events, and a 30-day suspension in 1995 for five 
surchargeable events,' MassDOT spokeswoman Sara Lavoie tells the Boston Herald.

'Before 
reinstating each time he had to complete a driver retraining course and 
pay a reinstatement fee.'

Malek graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1994. He completed his residency at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

Unlike his driving record, Malek has an unblemished medical disciplinary record and has won awards for his research on aneurisms. In 2012, U.S. News and World Report named Malek as one of the best doctors in the U.S.

Malek's work has been published in several medical journals, including the Journal of the American Medical Association.

The doctor was charged with reckless driving, but was released on bail shortly after.
