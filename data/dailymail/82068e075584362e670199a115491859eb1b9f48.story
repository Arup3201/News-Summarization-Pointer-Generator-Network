The daughter of the Austin police officer who fatally shot University of Texas Tower sniper Charles Whitman has now joined the Austin Police Department herself.

Monika McCoy is the 42-year-old daughter of Houston McCoy, who shot Whitman dead and ended the slaughter that left 17 people dead and 32 others wounded.

The mother of two sons says her children had been her priority. Now that they're grown, she says she's pursuing a career path that has been her dream since childhood.

Officer: Monika McCoy, daughter of hero cop Houston McCoy, is now an Austin Police Officer

Hero: Houston McCoy killed Charles Whitman, ending the terror at the University of Texas in 1966

Terror: Whitman killed 17 people while perched in the clock tower at the University of Texas

Monika McCoy was one of 33 cadets to receive their badges on Friday. Her father didn't live to see the day, having died a year ago at age 73. But Monika McCoy says she's sure that he and her mother are proud of her from beyond.

Prior to joining the Department, McCoy spent 10 years in the U.S. Army and worked as an accountant, according to the Houston Chronicle.

Before completing the Academy, McCoy had to prove that she could complete several different exercises, including a 300-meter run in 63 seconds or less, 33 or more push ups (un-timed), 36 or more sit ups in one minute and a 17-inch vertical jump.

Killer: After his death, an autopsy revealed Whitman had a brain tumor that may have caused him to kill

Whitman entered the University of Texas clock tower on the afternoon of August 1, 1966, armed with several high-powered rifles and enough food to sustain him for days. He then opened fire on the people below.

Prior to the clock tower shootings, Whitman murdered his mother and wife before penning a suicide note.

'I do not quite understand what it is that compels me to type this letter. Perhaps it is to leave some vague reason for the actions I have recently performed,' Whitman wrote in his note. 'I do not really understand myself these days. I am supposed to be an average reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately (I cannot recall when it started) I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts.'

Sick: In addition to the 17 killed at the UT campus, Whitman also killed his wife and mother

An autopsy later revealed that Whitman had a pecan-sized tumor in his brain that an independent commission determined could have played a role in his decision to kill innocent people.

McCoy's first day on the job was Sunday.
