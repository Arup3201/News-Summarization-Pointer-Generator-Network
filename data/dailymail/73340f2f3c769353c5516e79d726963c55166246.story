Something ELSE to worry about?! Ear lobe surgery is on the rise (seriously)

First there were cankles. Then there was back fat. Last week we were told about swoobs, mere moments after we'd come to terms with our big fat thutts.

But it seems the beauty industry hasn't yet run out of body parts they want to make us hate, then yearn to rip up and rebuild, stuffed full of collagen and Botox.

Well, not quite yet.

And the object of their contempt now? Our poor little earlobes.

Yes, try as they might to hide way up high behind hair and earrings, even these adorably plump dinky danglers are not safe from the surgeon's knife.

While most of us probably hadn't noticed our ears dangling lower than usual (or ever considered it much of a problem), cosmetic clinics are adamant that as we age our earlobes can begin to sag and grow longer, developing wrinkles and creases.

And luckily for us girls, experts say this condition is generally only present in females, and is often made worse by the use of earrings over the years.

However, with ear accessories such as the use of stretching tapers growing ever more popular with men, there is an increasing number of cases of male earlobe droop.

One clinic is even offering
 an earlobe rejuvenation treatment, claiming that with the application 
of dermal fillers such as Juvederm and Restylane you can now 
'revolumise and restore your earlobes to give them a more youthful 
looking appearance'. 

Experts use a hyaluronic filler, 
such as Juvaderm, Emervel or Restylane, to create this tissue-expanding 
earlobe effect.

And while Botox notoriously wears off after about four months, the clinic claims that the use of dermal filler in the earlobe tightens the lobe for far longer than when used in other areas, mainly due to the lack of wear and tear or any muscle movement in the area being treated.

Regency Aesthetics in London offer the £195 treatment, and describe it as the ideal 'lunch-time earlobe lift' - and proclaim you can, thank goodness, even wear your earrings 
immediately after treatment with no swelling or bruising.

Speaking
 about the new treatment, Dr Rikin said: 'Women come to us to subtly 
enhance their look and opting for treatments such as Earlobe Rejuvenation 
enables them to give the appearance of true youth in the places that 
matter.'

Time to ditch the bling? Experts say this condition is generally only present in females and is often made worse by the use of earrings over the years, especially big, heavy ones favoured by the likes of Kim Kardashian

Body image and wellbeing expert Katie Lowe of Fat Girl PhD said: 'I'd love to think that this is some kind of practical joke thrown out by the beauty industry, but it's nowhere near April Fool's Day yet - so I can only assume this is real.

'It's comical, really - unless anyone actually falls for it. Every time these cynical surgical types - who are quite clearly looking to make a quick buck out of people's insecurities - publicise a treatment like this, they're just perpetuating a "perfection at all costs" myth, and making people think negatively about a part of their body that nobody should ever, ever worry about.

'When I'm trying to work out how to show my true youth in a place that matters, I can safely say my earlobes are (and should be) categorically the bottom of the list.

'It's absolutely ridiculous, and I hope people see it that way - and spend their lunch times having a bite to eat, rather than an over-priced, ridiculous beauty treatment!'.

How bizarre:  While it's most common among women, trends such as stretching tapers, left, have made earlobe droop more common in men.  In some countries like Malayasia, elongated earlobes are revered
