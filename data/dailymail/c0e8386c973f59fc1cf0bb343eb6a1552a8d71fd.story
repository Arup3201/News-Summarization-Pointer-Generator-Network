Courtney Mitchell Lewis, 21, (above) of South Wales, took an overdose of slimming pills after his  loan spiralled from £100 to £800 in three months

A struggling student who died from an overdose after taking out a payday loan which spiralled from £100 to £800 in just three months, posted on Facebook prior to his death: 'I don't want to die.'

Courtney Mitchell Lewis, 21, took an overdose of slimming pills after his short-term loan spiralled to eight times the amount he had borrowed.

An inquest at Swansea Civic Centre heard how the physics undergraduate - known as Mitch to his friends - had taken out the loan while struggling for cash during his studies.

The student, of Aberdare, South Wales, was working as a barman while studying at Swansea University but decided to use the payday loan company to borrow £100.

Colin Phillips, acting senior Swansea coroner, said: 'Mitch was a loving and caring individual who was facing a number of personal problems.

'He had debts after taking out a £100 loan which had increased to £800 within just three months.'

The company offering the payday loan was not identified at the inquest but it is understood that it was investigated by police and found to be operating legally.

Following a night out with friends in May last year, Mr Lewis took pills he had bought as a slimming aid at his flat in Swansea and then posted a message to friends on Facebook saying: 'I don't want to die, I think it is too late.'

His friends called the emergency services and he was taken to A&E but the inquest heard it was too late to save him. 

The inquest heard Mr Lewis had taken the tablets as 'a cry for help rather than a serious suicide attempt.'

Mr Phillip ruled a verdict of misadventure at the hearing and said: 'Mitch took [the] tablets as a cry for help, but despite alerting friends who took him to hospital he died of toxicity.'

An inquest at Swansea Civic Centre heard how the physics undergraduate - known as Mitch to his friends -wrote on Facebook prior to his death: 'I don't want to die, I think it is too late.' He died in May last year

The coroner recorded a verdict of misadventure and said Mr Lewis had taken the tablets as a 'cry for help'

Mr Lewis was described as 'the man who always smiled' by his friends in university tributes.

Former Students' Union President Luke James said: 'His friendliness made it a better place to be every day.

'It is obvious his unique impact on our university and so many people's lives will be felt forever.'
