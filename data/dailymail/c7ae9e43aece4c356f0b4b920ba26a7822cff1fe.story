Andy Carroll's footballing career has been hampered by a succession of injuries, but his modelling career is off to a flyer as campaign photos hit New York's Times Square on Monday.

The 25-year-old West Ham striker has not scored a Premier League goal for over seven months, and is yet to play a match this season, but is having more luck when it comes to his off-field activities.

Carroll was chosen to front a H&M modelling campaign earlier this month after beating off competition from 200 other candidates, and has shown off a whole new set of skills since signing up with agency 'Select Models'.

Carroll returned to first-team training with West Ham last Thursday after an ankle injury

In a photograph posted on his Instagram account from Times Square, Carroll is seen wearing a simple black jumper, while spinning a football on his finger.

But football isn't something he has seen a lot of in the past few months, not featuring for the Hammers at all this season after suffering ankle ligament damage on the club's pre-season tour of New Zealand in July.

Early reports stated that the England striker could be out until 2015, but he is now expected to make a return as early as November 8 at home to Aston Villa, following an injury to Diafra Sakho.

The Senegal-born striker has been a revelation for the east-Londoners this season, scoring seven goals in his first seven starts, but he may have to pass the baton temporarily to Carroll following a shoulder injury picked up on Saturday.

Carroll returned to West Ham training last week, and manager Sam Allardyce spoke of his return shortly after.

'We'll try to get him through three or four behind-closed-doors games and if that goes alright, then we would hope to have him back... hopefully when he gets back he'll have a major impact.'

And an impact is exactly what Carroll will need to have, if West Ham are to maintain their extraordinary start to the Premier League season. 

They have won five of their first nine matches, and are unlikely occupants of a top-four position in the Premier League.

Allardyce spoke of his want to involve Carroll in practice matches before promoting him back to the first team, but given Sakho's injury, the West Ham manager's hand may be forced to include him sooner than expected.
