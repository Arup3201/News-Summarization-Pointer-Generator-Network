England fans are the world’s most pessimistic compared to their side's ability and just four per cent think they will win the World Cup this summer, according to a YouGov survey.

Roy Hodgson’s side are rank outsiders in Brazil – and the fans’ views reflect that, with South Koreans, Mexicans, Australians and Americans all backing their sides more than the English.

Only fans of England’s Group D rivals Costa Rica see themselves as less likely to bring home football’s top prize from Brazil - but due to England's superior rank, Three Lions fans are deemed to be more pessimistic.

At the last World Cup in 2010, four times more England fans thought they had a shot at glory - showing a huge drop in the nation’s expectations.

Now, 40 per cent say the Three Lions have ‘very little or no chance’ of winning the tournament in Brazil.

The study looked at the psyche of fans from 19 Brazil-bound countries and also revealed that 53 per cent of the English public are not even interested how the team perform at the World Cup – a rise on 2010’s 47 per cent.

But there is some love for England from further afield: Japan and Australia fans say Hodgson’s side play the second-most beautiful football in the world.

Unsurprisingly considering their recent Falklands banner - the Argentines say they will be rooting against England more than anyone else.

According to the report, England fans think Brazil will be lifting the 18-carat gold trophy in Brazil next month, with reigning champions Spain the second-most likely.

And despite long-standing rivalries with Germany and Argentina, England fans say that Russia are the team they would most like to see crash out early on.

Fans from Argentina, Brazil, Spain and, bizarrely, the USA all see themselves as the most likely to win the final in the Maracana on July 13.

But none of the 19 countries survey thought England were one of the two most likely winners.
