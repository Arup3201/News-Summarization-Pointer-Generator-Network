Fort Hood shooter Spc. Ivan Lopez wanted to transfer units because he was being bullied, claims a senior US official working with the investigation.

In an effort to discover why Lopez opened fire on his fellow soldiers on Wednesday, killing three before turning the gun on himself, the Army is examining the possibility he snapped after being tormented by colleagues.

The Army is not only looking into his mental health history, but how he had settled with his fellow soldiers with the 154 Transportation Company at the Texas base after arriving in February.

Suspicions he was bullied:  Army Spc. Ivan Lopez. Lopez killed three people and wounded 16 others in a shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, on Wednesday, April 2, 2014, before killing himself

One official familiar with the investigation into the mass shooting which also left 16 others injured, said that Lopez, 34, believed he was not being treated 'appropriately'.

The official told CNN that it was not clear whether these individuals or his commanding officer knew of his mental health issues or if he was being treated for anxiety or depression.

Officials have confirmed he received some initial mental health treatment at his previous post at Fort Bliss and was prescribed medications there.

Indeed, Lopez had sent a request into the army to leave Fort Hood, military investigators said on Monday.

Army spokesman Chris Grey did not indicate during a brief news conference Monday whether Spc. Ivan Lopez was granted the leave - as he revealed the shooting spree covered the equivalent of two city blocks as Lopez drive from one area to another on the Central Texas base randomly firing.

Authorities have said the shooting was preceded by an argument Lopez had with other soldiers in his unit.

Grey said Lopez fired more than 35 shots while driving from one building on the sprawling Texas Army base to another during the eight-minute rampage.

It ended when Grey said Lopez got out of his car and was confronted by a female military police officer who fired her gun but did not strike him.

Lopez then turned his .45-caliber pistol to his head and killed himself, Grey said.

Before the shootings, Lopez had taken to Facebook to rant about Sandy Hook and his anger at his tour of duty in Iraq.

Details of his social media accounts were revealed as investigators try to piece together what caused the 34-year-old Iraq War veteran to shot dead three soldiers on the Texas army base on Wednesday.

The Iraq War veteran was being evaluated for post-traumatic stress disorder, and his posts appear to show he was struggling to deal with his feelings of anger and anxiety after a robbery.

It is not yet clear what drove Lopez to kill three people and injure 16 others before taking his own life this week, but he had a history of depression.

Posts about his feelings were made on a Facebook account that a family member has confirmed did belong to the gunman.  

Snapped: Military police are attempting to understand why Lopez seemingly lost control of his faculties and opened fire on Wednesday - killing three people

In one, written last month around the time he bought the pistol used in the attack, he said he was 'Full of hate' after being robbed.

The post, seen by CNN, stated: 'My spiritual peace has just gone. Full of hate. Now I think I'll be damned.'

In another post he ranted about Sandy Hook gunman Adam Lanza, condemning the 20-year-old who killed 20 children and six teachers, for wanting a 'minute of fame as a villain'.

He added: 'It is stupid to me that anyone can have easy access to a powerful weapon without being mentally evaluated. This makes the government indirect accomplice.'

Another post on his Facebook revealed feelings of fear from his time in Iraq, where he claimed to have seen 'the most brutal explosion'.

The Rev. Jeff Miller lights four candles, one for each of the victims of the Fort Hood shooting and one for the alleged shooter, at the beginning of the worship service at First United Methodist Church in Killeen, Texas, on Sunday April 6, 2014

It read: 'Hours of agony waiting for an attack by the insurgency but we were able to exit Fallujah all alive. I was in vehicle #6.The worst was that #5 was a diesel truck, the perfect target. And I was only thinking about getting back with my family.'

Lieutenant General Mark Milley however said Lopez did not experience direct combat during his time in Iraq.

'We have not discovered any specific traumatic event, wounds received in action, contact with the enemy or anything else specific that he may have been exposed to while deployed,' he told CNN.

Chris Grey, spokesman for the army's investigation, has not yet commented on the Facebook posts.

He said: 'Given that the alleged shooter is deceased, the possibility does exist that we may never know exactly why the alleged shooter did what he did.'

Tragedy for the family: Ivan Lopez with his family on a day out - the Lopez family have reacted with total shock as to why he opened fire on Wednesday

The Lopez family, who live in Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, said in a statement they were 'dismayed' by the tragic events.

'This is a very painful situation,' the father of Ivan Lopez said in the statement. 'I ask for prayers for the affected families.'

The rampage is the third shooting at a military base in the United States in about six months that, along with a series of shootings in public places, such as schools and malls, has intensified a national debate over gun violence.

It has also raised questions about security at U.S. military installations, such as Fort Hood, home to some 45,000 soldiers and airmen assigned to the 335-square-mile (870-square-km) base, along with thousands of civilian employees.

'Obviously we have a gap. Anytime we lose an individual, something's gone wrong,' U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told reporters in Hawaii on Thursday.
