Peter Lawwell has urged Celtic fans to stick by the Parkhead club during what he called a ‘period of transition’.

The Scottish champions’ end-of-year financial results showed an £11.2million pre-tax profit — up from last year’s figure of £9.74m.

And those figures will prompt fresh debate over the club’s transfer strategy after they crashed out of the Champions League amidst claims they could have spent more on players.

Reiterating a previous assertion that the plc board ‘reinvest every penny’ in the club, however, chief executive Lawwell attributed the Champions League failure to a change in management at the club, saying: ‘The appointment of Ronny Deila, a young manager with progressive ideas, marked the beginning of a period of transition for the club.

‘The board will support Ronny and his coaching team in the transfer market and in the development of the football operation generally.

‘The board’s commitment is clear. The board will re-invest every penny received back into the club for the longer term. 

'We will continue to invest, not only in our own academy but also to scour the world for talent to develop and to make a difference at the club.

‘We cannot, however, put into jeopardy the long-term future of this club or its supporters with reckless spending.

‘The recent result in the qualifiers for the group stage for the Champions League and some results in the SPFL have been disappointing. 

'Football success is crucial to the club, but the experience of the appointments of Martin O’ Neill, Gordon Strachan and Neil Lennon shows us that time is needed to develop through periods of transition.’

While the profit figure will grab the headlines, Celtic’s revenues were down by 14.6 per cent to £64.7m in a year when the team reached the Champions League group stage and season-ticket holders were handed a £100 price cut.

On June 30, the club had £4m in the bank, with chairman Ian Bankier insisting the club will ‘live within (their) means’ in an impoverished Scottish marketplace.

‘The board is highly conscious of the financial environment in which we play football here in Scotland,’ he said.

‘The harsh reality is that the total income from broadcasting rights available to the Scottish game is a tiny fraction of what is available to our neighbours in England.

‘Within this context and in the face of these hard facts, the Board has evolved the strategy that the club, financially, has to adopt a self-sustaining model. In plain words, we have to live within our means. We cannot spend money that we don’t have.’

The figures came as Deila admitted it would be a ‘disaster’ if the club failed to win a fourth successive title.

Aberdeen, the club expected to pose the greatest challenge to the Premiership champions, travel to Glasgow today.

And Deila plans to throw recovered captain Scott Brown and new signings John Guidetti, Stefan Scepovic into his reshaped side following a stuttering start to the season.

Celtic have won just four of their 10 competitive games so far, crashing out of the Champions League twice.

Conceding his real task is to steady the ship and retain the title, however, the Norwegian coach admitted: ‘I know it’s going to be tough in the first year, I have been through it before at smaller clubs. It’s always tough.

‘But I have done it before and the fun part will come. To get there we need results. We need to win.

‘But I have a very good squad and if we don’t win the league it is a disaster. I know what the players can do and they know it, too. We have to keep working.’
