Camille Brown, 19, has been charged with murder

A 19-year-old student at West Virginia University who was found covered in her own urine, blood and feces has been charged with murdering an elderly pastor at his home over the weekend.

The body of Ronald Browning, 68, was discovered at his home in Beckley, West Virginia, by his wife on Saturday. 

Authorities believe he was beaten to death by Camille Brown that morning after she broke into the home.

Beckley is about 55 miles south of Charleston.

Browning died from blunt force trauma to his head and neck. 

Police took Brown into custody after another break-in at a home in the town of Mabscott.

When officers arrived, they reportedly found Brown inside the home covered in her own blood, urine and feces. 

As they questioned her, she defecated and urinated in her pants, NBC News reported. 

During questioning, Brown allegedly told officers she had killed a man with gray hair.

She also had cuts on her hands. 

Investigators do not believe Brown and Browning knew one another.

Brown was charged with first-degree murder, breaking and entering and disorderly conduct. 

She is being held in Southern Regional Jail in Beaver without bond.

Beckley detective Morgan Bragg said: 'The most disturbing factor in this case is the fact Brown and Browning did not know one another and her motive has yet to be determined.'

The suspect had no known criminal history and was not under the influence of drugs during the attack, according to police. 

Browning was a pastor at Cool Ridge Community Church. 

He also worked as a chaplain and volunteer at Raleigh General Hospital, WVA reported. 

Debbie Peyton, the director of volunteers at the hospital, said: 'I was devastated, in disbelief. 

'But it happened. And I didn't want to believe it. 

'He had a way of knowing if you were feeling bad and always tried to make you feel better.'

In addition to working at the hospital, Browning, 68, was a pastor at Cool Ridge Community Church
