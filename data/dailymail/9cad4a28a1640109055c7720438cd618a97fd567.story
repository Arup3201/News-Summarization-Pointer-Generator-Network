An elementary school teacher named as a person of interest in the abduction of a boy in 1989 has said the police investigation violates his rights.

Dan Rassier, 56, has written to state officials to complain about how police have treated him and his family, along with criticizing how the investigation has been handled into the disappearance of Jacob Wetterling more than two decades ago.

Jacob was 11 when he was abducted on October 
22, 1989, by a masked gunman at the end of Rassier's driveway in St 
Joseph, 80 miles from Minneapolis, Minnesota. The boy has never been found.

Scrutiny: Dan Rassier, 56, complained that police have harassed him for two decades over a missing boy who disappeared at the end of his driveway in St Joseph, Minnesota

Rassier was home alone at the 
time. He has been questioned multiple times but his name didn't come 
out publicly until 2010, when authorities searched his family farm over 
two-day period.

He still lives at the property with his elderly parents who he says have been put under a massive strain by the continual spotlight.

Investigators have examined tens of 
thousands of leads but there have been no arrests in the case that drew 
national attention and led to changes in sex offender registration laws.

This is the first time Rassier, an elementary school music teacher, has put his complaints in writing. 

When asked why he did so after all this time, he said: 'They are just going to keep me kind of on this lifeline dangling there forever, and I want that to stop.'

Forensic tests on items taken from the 2010 search have yielded no evidence linking them to the crime but 
investigators were still testing some items.

Rassier, who says he is innocent, has not been cleared.

In the letter, which was sent to 14 
departments and agencies, he wrote: 'Is it considered legal for law 
enforcement to give the public the perception I am guilty of something 
when I'm not?

Never found: Jacob Wetterling, 11, disappeared in 1989 in rural Minnesota but no arrests have ever been made in the case

'To destroy our family's name the way they did because they had a "Hunch!" is in itself, a serious crime. Nothing can make it right now.

'The damage has been done. But to leave the whole thing open to speculation and open to the public's imagination is just wrong!'

In his letter, Rassier also 
complained that authorities have not returned his property or listened 
to details he is offering about what he witnessed the night Jacob was 
taken.

Like any unsolved crime, Jacob Wetterling and his family along with the public deserve nothing less than the truth.

Letter of Dan Rassier

Stearns County 
Sheriff John Sanner is among a handful of people named in the letter. The sheriff
said that he hadn't seen it but couldn't comment regardless because the
investigation into the boy's abduction is still active.

Sanner
said authorities have put a tremendous amount of resources into solving
the case, and added: 'I won't be happy until we resolve the case. I'm 
not satisfied until that happens.'

Authorities have not elaborated on what prompted them to search Rassier's family farm two years ago, saying only that they had probable cause.

Rassier said he mailed the letter on Wednesday to 14 different agencies or state officials, including the Department of Public Safety, the Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training, the Board on Judicial Standards, as well as the Stearns County administrator and Senators Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, Representative Michele Bachmann and Governor Mark Dayton.

The Associated Press reached out to all 14 people to whom Rassier sent the letter. As of Thursday, no one confirmed that the letter had been received.

Rassier said if nothing else comes of the complaints he's lodging, at least he spoke out about what he perceived to be problems with the investigation.

He wrote: 'Like any unsolved crime, Jacob Wetterling and his family along with the public deserve nothing less than the truth.'

Jacob's mother Patty Wetterling said the family was out of town and hadn't seen Rassier's letter. She declined to comment.
