Arrested: Nicholas Rotundo, 23, allegedly duped a woman into emailing him nude photos of herself

A Google worker tricked a woman into sending him naked photos by claiming he was conducting a 'breast perception study' - and threatened to put the photos on a revenge porn website unless she sent more, court documents show.

Nicholas Rotundo, 23, who works at Google's Mountain View, California headquarters, was arrested earlier this month for cyberstalking after a Texas student contacted cops.

When investigators searched his computers, they found he had also duped two other women and taken images of them using their webcams, according to documents obtained by The Smoking Gun.

Rotundo joined Google as an Internal Technology resident after graduating from the University of Texas at Dallas in May 2013 and allegedly began cyberstalking the woman a month later.

He contacted the University of Texas at Dallas student, who had previously signed up to be part of studies for the college, saying he was looking for submissions for a breast perception study.

The email was sent from breastperceptionstudy@gmail.com and listed its sender as 'Women Study'. It said researchers were looking into 'the public's perception of different breast types', TGS reported.

The sender was asking for a 'full-body nude photograph' and other images of the woman’s breasts.

Initially, the emails said researchers were offering participants $4,500 for taking part but, when the woman failed to respond, the sum was upped to $8,500 'because of the need to finish the study'.

After learning of this new offer, she sent four naked photos of herself to the email address, and received an email thanking her and welcoming her to send any others she may wish, TGS reported.

Five weeks later, she received an email from a new email address from a man who claimed to have come across her naked photos, adding: 'I would hate for anybody else to see.' 

Accused: After receiving the images from the woman, he allegedly sent her another email pretending he had come across the photographs and would leak them unless she sent more graphic ones

He also attached one of the images of the woman, and pointed out that she was wearing a necklace that would make her easily identifiable.

The sender said that he would not leak the images as long as the woman sent a video - 'at least one minute long' - showing her masturbating, as well as other images of parts of her body. 

After the unidentified woman emailed photos of her breasts to someone she believed was conducting a study, she received this email on January 26, 2014:

'Hi. Hope you're having a good Sunday! I've stumbled across some pictures of you. The type that I would hate for anybody else to see, and I can make sure that nobody else does. However, I'm gonna need you to help me to fill out the set.'

He then demanded she sent him a variety of images and videos.

'Reply before midnight your time acknowledging that you received this and, at the very least, send a low res version of one of the above. I expect the rest by Wed, midnight. I've attached a picture [showing an image she had sent the 'researchers'] for reference. Wearing that necklace really hurt plausible deniability :) Again, if you sent all of this, I swear to it that no photo or video will surface and you will not be contacted again. Thanks :)'

'If you send all of this, I swear to it that no photo or video will surface and you will not be contacted again,' he allegedly wrote in the January 2014 email - adding a smiley face emoticon.

Then last month, he warned the woman that she needed to send the photos otherwise 'you might find something you don't like' on Pink Meth, a revenge porn web site. 

He said that she should not contact authorities because he had covered his tracks, but she went to campus police, and investigators learned he had actually done little to hide his identity.

Investigations showed that the email accounts were accessed from an IP address that had been subscribed to by 'Google Nick Rotundo'. He had also signed into the email account from a New York hotel that is opposite Google offices, and records showed Rotundo was in the city on that date, the Smoking Gun reported.

When investigators showed the woman a picture of Rotundo, she said she recognized him, although it is not known what relationship they had.

Searches also showed photos of two other women that he had allegedly taken through webcams without their knowledge, court documents said. 

Rotundo was arrested on October 4 and was indicted on two cyberstalking charges, which each carry a maximum penalty of five years behind bars. Another charge of computer intrusion carries a maximum sentence of one year in prison.

He paid $4,500 bond and will next appear in court in December. He has also been prohibited from using the internet in that time.
