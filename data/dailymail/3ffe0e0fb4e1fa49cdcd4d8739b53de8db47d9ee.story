Cardiff City have signed striker Adam Le Fondre on a three-year deal from Championship rivals Reading.

The 27-year-old is Ole Gunnar Soskjaer's fourth signing of the summer and joins new arrivals Javi Guerra, Guido Burgstaller and Federico Macheda.

Le Fondre scored 15 goals last season yet was not a regular starter under Royals boss Nigel Adkins.

Done deal: Reading striker Adam Le Fondre has signed a three-year deal with Cardiff

Goalscoring record: Le Fondre is Ole Gunnar Soskjaer's fourth signing of the summer

He has 
built a fine goalscoring reputation in the Championship, and Solskjaer 
will be hoping his goals can help Cardiff return to the Premier League.

Le
 Fondre said: 'It’s such a great opportunity for me to come here to 
Cardiff City and play for a boyhood hero of mine in Ole Gunnar Solskjær,
 it was a move I just couldn’t say no to.

'I’m delighted to be working with Ole and I can’t wait to get started. Scoring is what I’m about, I’ve often got into double figures during my career although looking back at last season it’s one I really wanted to score more in personally.

'They are the high standards I set myself and now the aim is to do that with Cardiff City.'
