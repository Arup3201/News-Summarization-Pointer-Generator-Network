Shelling by pro-Russian rebels has killed at least 30 people, and injured 83, in Mariupol - a single day after the separatists rejected a peace deal signed last year.

'Indiscriminate rocket fire' from long range GRAD Missiles struck a market, two schools, homes and shops according to the regional police force.

The rocket fire had come from rebel-held territory, the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe said this evening, as NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called on Russia to stop supplying arms tot he separatists.

'Russian troops in eastern Ukraine are supporting these offensive operations with command and control systems, air defence systems with advanced surface-to-air missiles, unmanned aerial systems (drones), advanced multiple rocket launcher systems and electronic warfare systems,' he said.

'I strongly urge Russia to stop its military, political and financial support for the separatists, stop destabilising Ukraine and respect its international commitments.'

Senseless: Ukraine's Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk has condemned the bombing as a deliberate attack on peaceful citizens

Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko has cut his visit to Saudi Arabia short to call an emergency meeting of his military officials, to coordinate the government's response.

The country's Prime Minister Arseny Yatseniuk has condemned the bombing as a 'deliberate attack on peaceful citizens' and laid the overall blame on Russia's doorstep. 

He said: 'The world needs to stop the Russian aggressor threatening Ukraine, Europe and global security. 

'The problem is in the hero-town of Moscow, the Kremlin, Vladimir Putin.' 

 A 76-year-old pensioner who witnessed the attacks, said they started in the early morning.

Leonid Vasilenko, who lives in the eastern suburbs of Mariupol, said: 'The walls were shaking, the window frames were shaking, paint started to crumble off the house. 

'I hid in the basement. What else can you do? I took the dog and the cat. In the basement you could hear the earth tremble.'

Revenge: It is thought today's attack in Mariupol (pictured) was payback for the explosion which killed 13 people in the rebel-held eastern region of Donetsk on Thursday

A 76-year-old pensioner who witnessed the attacks, said they started in the early morning.

Leonid Vasilenko, who lives in the eastern suburbs of Mariupol, said: 'The walls were shaking, the window frames were shaking, paint started to crumble off the house. 

'I hid in the basement. What else can you do? I took the dog and the cat. In the basement you could hear the earth tremble.' 

Mariupol mayor Yuriy Khotlubei said: 'The area that came under attack was massive.

'The shelling was carried out by militants. This is very clearly Russian aggression that has caused terrible losses for the residents of the eastern part of our city.'

Despite international calls for a ceasefire, the separatists' leader Alexander Zakharchenko has vowed to push on with a new offensive and expel Ukrainian troops from the eastern region entirely.

It is thought today's attack was payback for the explosion which killed 13 people in the rebel-held eastern region of Donetsk on Thursday.

He said the insurgents would take no further part in peace talks, adding: 'Today an offensive was launched on Mariupol. This will be the best possible monument to all our dead.

'Attempts to talk about a cease-fire will no longer be undertaken by our side.' 

At a defence meeting in Kiev, Ukraine's defence minister Stepan Poltorak said there had been a serious escalation in fighting on the front-lines in the last 24 hours.

'Starting from Luhansk region and ending in Mariupol, everywhere illegal armed groups together with Russian units are going on the offensive,' he said.

'Strategically important': The coastal city of Mariupol lies on the Azov sea, between Russia and the annexed Crimean Peninsula

The rebels' new multi-pronged offensive against the country's troops has seriously hindered recent attempts to mediate an end to the fighting.

Government-controlled Mariupol occupies a strategically important position on the Sea of Azov, on a coastal route from the Russian border to Crimea, which was annexed by Russia from Ukraine last March. 

Fierce fighting since the peace deal was signed in Minsk in September has heightened fears the rebel forces would try to establish a land link between Russia and Crimea. They currently have positions around six miles from Mariupol's eastern outskirts. 

The agreement signed in the Belarusian capital tried to instigate a cease-fire and the removal all of heavy weapons from certain areas in eastern Ukraine.

But it has been repeatedly violated by both sides - and heavy artillery and rocket barrages have increased the civilian death toll in the last few weeks.

On Thursday, mortar shells rained down on rebel-held areas of eastern Ukraine - killing 13 people at a bus stop.

The separatists retaliated both swiftly and brutally by parading captured Ukrainian troops through the city as enraged residents kicked and shouted abuse at them.

Cut off: Emergency workers inspected a damaged bridge on January 21, following an overnight blast which severed the railway link between Mariupol and Ukraine's west

And last weekend, battles intensified over Donetsk airport, which has been reduced to rubble after months of fighting.

Rebels eventually took control of the terminal and fighting has continued on its fringes since.

Last week, Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko claimed there were 9,000 Russian troops inside his country and called on Moscow to withdraw them - blaming it for an armed aggression.

Moscow denies sending soldiers and weapons to east Ukraine, despite what the West deems 'irrefutable proof'.

Zakharchenko, who claims rebel fighters were advancing in three directions in Donetsk, said: 'We will hit them until we reach the border of Donetsk region, and if I see the danger for Donetsk from any other city, I will destroy this threat there.'

On Wednesday, foreign ministers from Russia, Ukraine, France and Germany agreed to revive a division line between separatists and Ukraine's troops, but fighting has continued unabated. 

The tentative peace deal forged in Berlin  called on both Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed rebels to pull their heavy arms nine miles on either side of the division line - although there was no agreement reached on a withdrawal of troops.

Death: At least 13 people were killed, and many were injured, in the bus attack in Donetsk - just hours after peace talks in Berlin called for a cease fire

Offensive: Zakharchenko has said pro-Russian rebels (pictured) are advancing in three directions in Donetsk, in a bid to claim the city entirely

But rebel spokesman Eduard Basurin threw the agreement into doubt by saying the insurgents 'will no longer consider the Minsk agreement in the form it was signed'.

Basurin's bold statement contradicted the official position of Russia, which has repeatedly pledged respect for the Minsk agreement, which also requested the withdrawal of foreign fighters and the monitoring of the Russian-Ukrainian border by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.

The UN human rights agency has estimated that 5,100 people have been killed as a result of the conflict since April last year.
