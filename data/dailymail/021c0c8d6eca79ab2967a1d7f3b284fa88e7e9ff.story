The 39-degree heat in Fortaleza meant Holland and Mexico were given the World Cup's first official 'cooling break', as fans were seen retreating to the back of the stands to avoid the scorching sun.

Referee Pedro Proenca allowed three minutes on the half-hour and 75-minute mark to cool off and take in drinks at Estadio Castelao, while supporters maneuvered their way into pockets of shade.

It is worrying, though, with the temperature of Qatar - the controversial hosts of the 2022 tournament - more than capable of reaching in excess of 40 degrees.

Time: The water breaks gave Miguel Herrera - still wearing his suit jacket despite the raging heat - three minutes to talk tactics with his players

The temperature in Qatar between May and September can be as low as 30 degrees or as high as 50.

It has even been recorded at a worrying 53 degrees before.

The area also suffers sandstorms during the dry season.

In December and January - should the tournament become a winter World Cup - Qatar can be hit by rain showers, but the temperature will drop between a more modest mid 30s to mid 20s.

The three minutes, which also gave Mexico boss Miguel Herrera and Holland manager Louis van Gaal time to talk tactics, were added to stoppage time at the end of the half. As were the three minutes taken in the 75th minute.

The breaks would certainly be needed in Qatar, given temperatures can 
rise to a worrying 50 degrees.

It has been argued that such heat would prove dangerous for both players and supporters.

Elsewhere, though, former England and Manchester 
United defender Rio Ferdinand joined in, taking to social 
media to show off a selfie of himself taking his own drinks break.

But one man who the seemed to not be bothered by the heat was Herrera, who kept his suit jacket on throughout as he watched his team concede two goals in as many minutes to crash out.

Herrera, the least-paid manager at the World Cup on Â£125,000-a-year, coped well with the heat since the tournament began, leading Mexico out of a tough Group A at the expense of Croatia and Cameroon.

Rio too! Ferdinand took his own drinks break, taking to Twitter to pose with his drink in the sun
