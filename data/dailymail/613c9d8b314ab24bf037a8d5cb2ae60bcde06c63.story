Police are hunting two hit and run cyclists who knocked down a four-year-old girl, leaving these tyre marks on her face.

Aaliyah Raj had been out with her mother Samita, 24, on the seafront in Eastbourne, East Sussex, when she was struck by one of the bikes, which was being ridden in a no cycling zone.

One of the cyclists even rode over the little girl, leaving her with a swollen and bruised face, as well as cuts to her legs.

Injury: Aaliyah Raj, four, was out with her mother Samita, 24, on the seafront in Eastbourne, East Sussex, when she was struck by a bike and left with these tyre marks on her face

When Ms Raj tried to stop the bare-chested men they yelled at her and rode away without stopping to check on Aaliyah.

'One knocked Aaliyah over and rode over her and the other cyclist swerved around her,' said sales assistant Ms Raj, who lives in Eastbourne.

'She was on the floor screaming. I tried to run after them but they carried on towards the Pier.

'They stopped briefly just to hurl abuse at me and then they rode off.'

Sussex Police are now appealing to anyone who may have seen the incident, which happened on Thursday evening, or knows the cyclists, to contact them.

Ms Raj had flagged down a passing police car and gave detectives descriptions of the two men, who she said were both bare chested and in their mid-20s.

'I am going to be contacting the council,' she said.

'Cyclists shouldn’t even be on the promenade. I don’t want them to get away with it.

'Aaliyah is on her way to becoming fine now and is almost back to her normal self, thank God, but it worries me that this could happen again to someone else’s child.”

Aaliyah added: 'There were two bad men on bikes who knocked me over and then rode over me.'
