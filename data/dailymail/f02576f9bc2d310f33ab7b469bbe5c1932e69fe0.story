Unhappy: John Clarke, father of deaf schoolgirl Hafwen (pictured together) is threatening to sue his local council because his daughter has a right to a Welsh sign language expert

The father of a deaf schoolgirl is threatening to sue his local council because they have failed to find his daughter a Welsh signing expert.

John Clarke, 45, is furious because he believes his child Hafwen, eight, whose name means 'summer's beauty' in English, should be taught in the language they speak at home.

Hafwen was born profoundly deaf and has until recently been taught at a Welsh-speaking school near Aberystwyth, west Wales, with a qualified signer helping her in class.

But the signer retired and the local education authority has been unable to find a replacement despite advertising the post twice.

Taxi driver Mr Clarke said: 'Hafwen has a right to be educated in Welsh - she has the same rights as able-bodied children.

'We're trying to do our best for our daughter, but it seems we are banging our heads against a brick wall.'

When she was three, Hafwen started at Penrhyncoch Primary School, near Aberystwyth, where her parents, father and brother all went.

The school provided her with a signer for four years but when that teacher left they could not find a full-time replacement.

Mr and Mrs Clarke say they had no choice but to withdraw Hafwen from the school - because there was no point in her attending classes she could not understand.

In the meantime she has started at another school which can help her temporarily with a Welsh language signer.

Ceredigion council today said it had advertised for a replacement without success.

Upset: John and Caryl Clarke sign with Hafwen, and have given a deadline of March before they take legal action

But the Clarkes are threatening to sue, claiming the local authority is breaching the Education Act and the Welsh Language Act.

Mr Clarke said: 'Hafwen is entitled to be educated in Welsh at the school of her choice.'

Ceredigion council said it was still trying to fill the post in a bid to get Hafwen back to school.

A spokeswoman said: 'Despite advertising the post twice, including an advert in the local press, no one suitable was found to support the pupil.

'The authority has always maintained that it is willing to support the parents' choice of school which is Penrhyncoch and will continue to work with the school to find a suitably qualified teaching assistant.'

Mr and Mrs Clarke have given the council until March 29 to recruit a replacement before starting legal action.
