A teenage couple have been killed in a motorbike crash on their way to a fundraising event for an air ambulance that tried to save them.

Bradley Cooper, 18, and Abbey Parker, 17, both died in a horrific collision with two tractors in North Fambridge, Essex.

Bradley was riding a Yamaha, which had been a present for his 17th birthday, and his girlfriend Abbey was riding pillion.

Tragic: Abbey Parker, 17, and Bradley Cooper, 18, died after their motorbike crashed into two tractors

They were both on their way to the 13th annual motorcycle run, a charity event for Essex Air Ambulance which attracts more than 5,000 bikers.

An Essex Air Ambulance was called to 
the scene of the crash but nothing could be done to save the young 
couple who were pronounced dead at the scene.

A 43-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of causing death whilst uninsured and has been bailed until next year.

The families of the couple paid tribute to Abbey, who was described as 'fun, bubbly and a wonderful daughter', and Bradley, who was 'kind, considerate' and the 'most wonderful son'.

The motorbike run sees thousands of bikers gather at Ford Dunton, Laindon, Essex, before travelling in convoy for 60 miles to Harwich where a charity day takes places.

On their way to the event on Sunday, at around 9.30am, the couple collided with a Case International tractor and then another tractor.

Dozens of flowers were laid at the scene of the crash and a Facebook group with over 6,400 supporters conveyed heartfelt messages for Bradley, who was a mechanical apprentice, and Abbey, a hairdresser.

Abbey’s mother, Louise, father, Stewart and
brother Carlo Parker from Mayland, Essex, left a tribute to her saying: 'Abbey was a fun, bubbly and a wonderful daughter, 
sister, niece and granddaughter. Abbey lived life to the full everyday.

'Abbey was a keen dancer from a young age, through school and into her teenage years.

'Abbey’s entire family are going to miss her more than words can describe.

'The
family wish to thank everyone for there kind words and flowers at this 
difficult time and it is greatly appreciated by all.'

The couple 
had both been pupils at William de Ferrers School, where Abbey’s mum works as a science technician.

The charity event the couple were on their way to was to raise money for Essex Air Ambulance and it was an Essex Air Ambulance that came to try and save the couple

Bradley’s
family said: 'For the short time Bradley
was with us, every single moment was a joy and every joyful moment we 
had we shall cherish in our hearts forever.

'He always woke in the morning with a smile on his face and went to bed with a smile.

'He
spoke to and brought joy to everyone he met. He was a kind and 
considerate friend, loyal brother, looking out for his sisters and the 
most wonderful son and treasured grandson anyone could ask for.

'Never judging, only loving. Thank you for every moment of joy you have brought us all, and will still bring in our wonderful memories.

'Our love for you is a journey, starting at forever and ending at never, you wonderful, special young man.

'You are now together with your wonderful, darling Abbey, no one will ever keep you apart.'

Andrew Merchant, deputy headteacher at the school they both went to, said staff and 
students had been left stunned by the tragedy.

He said: 'This is a terrible tragedy. They were both very well-liked and out hearts and prayers go out to both families.'

A schoolfriend of the couple, Aaron Parkhurst-Thompson, said: 'We
are all devastated over the loss of Bradley and Abbey, they where both 
such wonderful people to see and be around.

'They will both be missed greatly, two more stars to 
brighten up the night.'

Christopher Condon, the father of a work colleague's of Bradley's wrote: 'My thoughts are with both sets of 
parents for the loss of these two beautiful kids, and I would like them 
to know Brad and Abbey were a pleasure to be around and always 
brightened my family’s day.'

It is not the first time that the popular event has been struck by tragedy.

In 2005, biker Susan Young, of Great Baddow, Essex, was killed on the A12 at Kelvedon as she made her way home.

The Essex Air Ambulance was called to the scene of the crash but nothing could be done to save the 36-year-old.
