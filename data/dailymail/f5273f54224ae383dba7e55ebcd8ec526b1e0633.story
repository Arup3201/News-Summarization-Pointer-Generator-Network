There was a standing ovation for her son as he arrived on Centre Court as the first British man to defend a Wimbledon singles title for 77 years.

But up in the stands yesterday, Andy Murray’s mother Judy was getting ready to become the star of the show herself.

Mrs Murray is said to be in the ‘advanced stage’ of talks to appear in the next series of Strictly Come Dancing.

The 54-year-old is a big fan of the BBC programme and often posts saucy comments about its male performers on her Twitter account. A source said: ‘The final line-up is due to be announced in four weeks’ time and Judy is a long way down in talks to appear on it.’

Her friend and former British tennis number one Andrew Castle, who appeared on Strictly in 2008, has described Mrs Murray as  a ‘Strictly nut’ who would jump at the chance of appearing on  the programme.

But he fears her 27-year-old son will be left squirming with embarrassment at his mother’s antics on screen and would be better off watching the show ‘through his fingers’.

Mrs Murray was vocal about her admiration for the male dancers on the programme  last year after watching the Strictly Confidential stage  spin-off in Glasgow.

She posed for a picture with topless Russian star Artem Chigvintsev and posted it on Twitter with the comment: ‘Check this girls. Strictly Confidential but … life may well be complete now.’

A year earlier, she also posted cringe-inducing commentary about the celebrity performers at Strictly Come Dancing’s Live UK Tour at the SECC in Glasgow.

Former footballer Robbie Savage and Olympic swimmer Mark Foster received most of the attention, with Mrs Murray writing on Twitter: ‘I’ll need a lie down after this. Ooooh Rob. You have perfected the pelvic thrust.’

Then, when Foster took the stage, she posted: ‘Mark Foster says he will dance his Speedos if he wins Strictly tonight. Ooh er. Get voting.’

Her son was also left aghast  in 2011 when Mrs Murray  posted a series of tweets praising the good looks of his Spanish Wimbledon opponent  Feliciano Lopez.

In a rare outburst, Murray declared: ‘I think it’s about  time that she stopped that  nonsense. It’s making me throw up. It’s disgusting.’

If his mother does appear in this autumn’s Strictly, she will have to fit it around her duties as captain of the Great Britain Fed Cup Team.

Mrs Murray trained Andy and his older brother Jamie – now a successful doubles player – on public courts in their home town of Dunblane.

She is credited with passing on her competitive spirit to her sons, and is often seen in the crowd fist-pumping and making faces during big points.

Mrs Murray – who once received vile hate mail accusing her of being a pushy parent – was greeted by embraces from friends and adoring fans alike as she watched her son sail into second round yesterday in a straight sets win over Belgian David Goffin. And if she had felt any parental anxiety ahead of the clash, she hid it well, laughing and joking with fans queuing outside Centre Court.

Dressed casually in a loose-fitting lemon jumper and patterned black and yellow trousers, Mrs Murray was seen attempting to rally with a spectator – playing with purple novelty tennis racquets and a rubber chicken instead of a ball.

She was joined by her son’s girlfriend Kim Sears and  his new coach Amélie Mauresmo to watch him defeat Goffin, 23, who is ranked 105 in the world.

Prior to the match, Judy tweeted a photograph of Mauresmo and Murray in matching T-shirts and nicknamed the duo ‘Murresmo’.

Last week she told of her ‘survivor’s guilt’ over the Dunblane massacre in 1996, when 16 children and a teacher were killed at the school attended by her sons.

Mrs Murray, who is divorced from her children’s father Willie, said she still becomes emotional when she revisits the town to talk about ‘everything that Andy and Jamie have achieved’.
