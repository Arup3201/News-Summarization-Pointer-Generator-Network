Barcelona had a training camp at England's St. Georges' Park before their most recent friendly without their star man.

They drew 1-1 against French Ligue 1 side Nice, with veteran midfielder Xavi rescuing a share of the spoils.

There is still three weeks before the La Liga season kicks off, and the Catalan giants will find out if new signing Luis Suarez's ban is to be reduced by the CAS this week.
