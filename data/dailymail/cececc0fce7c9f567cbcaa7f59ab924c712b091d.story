Two former dictators who oversaw the systematic stealing of babies from political prisoners in Argentina 30 years ago have been sentenced to a total of 65 years in prison.

The convictions of Rafael Videla and Reynaldo Bignone has been seen as a big step in Argentina's effort to punish the human rights abuses of that era, although authorities say it is certainly not the last.

At least 17 other major cases are before judges or are nearing trial.

Among them is a 'mega-trial' involving the Navy Mechanics School, which became a feared torture center as the 1976-1983 military junta kidnapped and killed 13,000 opponents while trying to annihilate an armed leftist uprising.

That case involves 65 defendants, nearly 900 victims, more than 100 witnesses and about 60,000 pages of evidence.

A 'Never Again' commission formed shortly after Argentina's democracy was restored in 1983 documented thousands of crimes against humanity during the military regime, but hardly any of the violators were prosecuted until the late Nestor Kirchner was elected president 20 years later.

Justice Minister Julio Alak said Thursday that Kirchner's wife and successor, President Cristina Fernandez, deserves credit for making the human rights cases a cornerstone of government.

'It's unthinkable that in a state of 
law, the murderers of the people could be in any place but prison,' Alak
said after the verdicts were read.

Videla, 86, was sentenced to 50 years in prison, while the 84-year-old Bignone got 15 years for their roles in the baby thefts.

The
prison time is symbolic, though, because both men have been behind bars
for years following multiple convictions and life sentences for other 
crimes against humanity.

Seven
of their co-defendants were also convicted on charges involving the 
theft of 34 babies, while two people were acquitted by a three-judge 
panel.

Despite the jailing 
of Videla and Bignone, most people who have been convicted of rights 
violations during the dictatorship remain free on appeal and many others
have yet to stand trial.

According
to a March tally by Argentina's independent Center for Legal and Social
Studies, a total of 1,861 defendants have been named in cases of state 
terror, but verdicts were reached for only 17 per cent of them - with 92
per cent of those found guilty.

Since
the trials began in 2006, at least 65 have resulted in sentences, but 
only seven of these have exhausted an appeals process that takes more 
than two years on average.

Still,
Thursday's verdicts were a cause for celebration outside the federal 
courthouse in Buenos Aires, where activists watched them being announced
on a huge television screen.

'This
is an historic day. Today legal justice has been made real - never 
again the justice of one's own hands, which the repressors were known 
for,' prominent rights activist Tati Almeida said.

The
baby thefts set Argentina's military regime apart from all the other 
juntas that ruled in Latin America at the time. Videla and other 
military and police officials were determined to remove any trace of the
armed leftist guerrilla movement they said threatened the country's 
future.

Many pregnant 
women detained as dissidents were 'disappeared' shortly after giving 
birth in clandestine maternity wards, and their babies were handed over 
to families trusted by military officials.

In
his testimony, Videla denied there was any systematic program for 
stealing babies, and accused prisoners of using their unborn children as
'human shields' in their fight against the state.

He
called himself a 'political prisoner,' labeled the trial a farce and 
characterized his sentence as revenge by people who after being defeated
militarily now occupy positions in the government.

Despite this, Videla said, he would accept his sentence 'in protest, as an act of service,' and with a clear conscience.

Witnesses during the trial included former U.S. diplomat Elliot Abrams.

He
was called to testify after a long-classified memo describing his 
secret meeting with Argentina's ambassador was made public at the 
request of the Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a human rights group 
whose evidence-gathering efforts were key to the prosecution.

Abrams
testified from Washington that he secretly urged that Bignone reveal 
the stolen babies' identities as a way to smooth Argentina's return to 
democracy.

'We knew 
that it wasn't just one or two children,' Abrams testified, suggesting 
that there must have been some sort of directive from a high level 
official - 'a plan, because there were many people who were being 
murdered or jailed.'

No
reconciliation effort was made. Instead, Bignone ordered the military 
to destroy evidence of 'dirty war' activities, and the junta denied any 
knowledge of baby thefts, let alone responsibility for the 
disappearances of political prisoners.

The U.S. government also revealed little of what it knew as the junta's death squads were eliminating opponents.

The
Grandmothers have since used DNA evidence to help 106 people who were 
stolen from prisoners as babies recover their true identities, and 26 of
these cases were part of this trial. Many were raised by military 
officials or their allies, who falsified their birth names, trying to 
remove any hint of their leftist origins.

The
rights group estimates as many as 500 babies could have been stolen in 
all, but the destruction of documents and passage of time make it 
impossible to know for sure.

The
trial featured gut-wrenching testimony from relatives who searched 
inconsolably for their missing children, and from people who learned as 
young adults that they were raised by some of the very people involved 
in the disappearance of their birth parents.

The
other seven defendants convicted and sentenced Thursday included former
Adm Antonio Vanek, 40 years; former marine Jorge 'Tigre' Acosta, 30; 
former Gen Santiago Omar Riveros, 20; former navy prefect Juan Antonio 
Azic, 14; and Dr Jorge Magnacco, who witnesses said handled some of the 
births, 10.

Former 
Capt Victor Gallo and his ex-wife Susana Colombo were sentenced to 15 
and five years in jail, respectively, after their adopted son, now going
by his birth name Francisco Madariaga, testified against them.
