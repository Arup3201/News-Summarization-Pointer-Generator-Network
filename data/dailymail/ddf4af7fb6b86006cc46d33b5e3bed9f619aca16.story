Sir Jimmy Savile's campaign of alleged child abuse took place over six decades

Jimmy Savile's alleged campaign of child sex abuse could include as many as 60 victims spanning over six decades, investigators have revealed.

Police have trebled their original estimates of the number of preyed upon youngsters, after soaring numbers of alleged victims have come forward in the wake of the scandal.

Detectives said the figure accounts for 'predominately' teenage girls.

Today it was also reported Savile was previously investigated by police six times after a series of sex abuse claims, the first one taking place as early as 1958.

And fresh allegations have come to light that the alleged child molester was 'given the keys' to Broadmoor secure hospital around 1988, when cabinet minister Ken Clarke was Health Secretary.

It was claimed the predatory paedophile molested a 17-year-old patient at the high security mental hospital, Broadmoor, which he was given the gold-plated keys to as a reward for his volunteering.

The Department of Health (DoH) has been dragged into
the scandal over its decision to appoint Savile to lead a 'taskforce' overseeing management restructuring at the hospital.

The department will carry out an investigation into how he was given the position and the DoH could be sued by victims as it was running the place at the time.

Mr Clarke was forced to defend himself last night, saying: 'I have no recollection of ever having met Jimmy Savile and no
recollection of these events.

'The DoH are rightly now investigating to
establish the facts.'

A spokeswoman for Mr Clarke said that as he only became
health secretary in July 1988, Savile's appointment to the role at Broadmoor
may have been instigated by someone else.

In a statement, the DoH said: 'We will investigate the
Department of Health's conduct in apparently appointing Savile to this role.

'In hindsight he should very obviously not have been
appointed.'

There are now reports of alleged abuse starting in 1959 up to and including 2006, the year in which Savile is pictured, right. The former DJ is pictured left in 1960, two years after the first police investigation

There are growing 
fears NHS bosses turned a blind eye to sick and disabled children being 
attacked by the former DJ because he raised so much money for them.

Scotland Yard detectives are now in contact with 14 other forces investigating the Jim'll Fix It  star's abuses, with police pursuing 340 lines of inquiry across the country.

So far 12 allegations of sexual offences have been officially
recorded but this number is increasing.

Savile was allegedly investigated by police during a series of sex abuse inquiries since 1958 but each time he evaded justice.

Cabinet minister Ken Clarke, left, was reportedly Health Secretary when Savile, right, was given the keys to Broadmoor hospital where he allegedly abused a 17-year-old girl

He was first investigated by police 'for interfering with young girls' when working as a nightclub manager in Leeds as long ago as 1958, his former bodyguard told The Sunday Telegraph.

In the late 1960s there was an inquiry into underage sex taking place in the Top of the Pops changing rooms, according to the show's then producer. Police reportedly interviewed BBC staff but did not pursue a case.

There was an allegation in 1971 that the late TV host was involved with a 15-year-old dancer on Top of the Pops, who committed suicide.

And there were claims Savile was abusing patients at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in the late 1970s, allegations which were reported to police but there was not enough evidence to proceed.

In the past five years there were two further police investigations. These included one in 2007, in which Surrey Police questioned Savile over allegations of child sex abuse in the 1970s at Duncroft school.

But the case was dropped after the Crown Prosecution Service advised there was insufficient evidence.

A spokesman for the force said: 'In 2007 Surrey Police received an historic
allegation of indecent assault which is alleged to have occurred at a
children's home in Staines during the 1970s. The allegation was investigated
and an individual was interviewed under caution.

'The matter was referred to the
Crown Prosecution Service for a charging decision who advised there was
insufficient evidence to take any further action.'

A senior member of staff at the BBC revealed he questioned Savile, pictured, over rumours about his private life more than 20 years ago

Meanwhile, photographs of Savile in the act of grooming vulnerable girls at the school for fragile children have emerged.

One of the photos shows him looking surprised to be captured as he holds a private conversation with five girls.

The other photo, obtained by the Sunday Express, snaps the paedophile in a cheesy pose with his arms open, surrounded by eight teenage girls. One of the girls is pictured lifting her skirt to show a garter.

One of his victims, pictured in the photo, was a pupil aged just 14 when she was abused by Savile in 1977.

She summoned up the courage to report him to her head teacher but instead of the police being called she was sent to her room and deprived of food, she claimed.

She said: 'He came to the school a couple of times a year, bringing presents of records and magazines and was far too tactile with the pupils, who saw him as a superstar.'

After being invited into an empty office with him at the age of 14, she claims he molested her for several minutes, ignoring her protests.

She recalled: 'I said to him "Get off, you can't do that", but he wouldn't listen. In the end I had to push him off and then I ran into a nearby bathroom and locked myself in.'

Last Tuesday police were investigating claims Savile abused 20 victims and this figure doubled to 40 potential victims on Friday. The alleged cases of abuse took place in studios, care homes, schools, hospitals and nightclubs.

Commander Peter Spindler, head of MPS Specialist Crime
Investigations said: ‘We can now confirm that we have received information from
the public that suggest allegations against Jimmy Savile span six decades with
reports starting in 1959 up to and including 2006.

‘Having now had the opportunity to review progress one week
on I have revised my estimate of the number of likely victims to be about 60.

‘Once again I want to thank those who have come forward and
reassure them, and anyone else who contacts us, they will be listened to.’

The scandal emerged when ITV screened a documentary
in which five women alleged they were abused by the late DJ and broadcaster.

The BBC came under fire after it was revealed Newsnight abandoned an investigation into the alleged abuse in December 2011.

And a senior member of staff at the BBC revealed he questioned Savile over rumours about his private life more than 20 years ago.

The property Savile would stay in when visiting Broadmoor Hospital, to which he was given the keys in 1988

Derek Chinnery, who as Radio 1 controller from 1978 to 1985 was Savile's boss, admitted that he quizzed the presenter directly about the rumours of suspected abuse.

Mr Chinnery told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House: 'I asked, "what's all this, these rumours we hear about you Jimmy?'."

'And he said, "that's all nonsense". There was no reason to disbelieve (Savile).'

Savile worked at Radio 1 from 1969 to 1989 presenting a show of chart songs from previous decades.

Speaking about his acceptance of Savile's denial, Mr Chinnery told the BBC: 'It's easy now to say how could you just believe him just like that.'

He added: 'He was the sort of man that attracted rumours, after all, because he was single, he was always on the move, he was always going around the country.'

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the corporation has lessons to learn following the allegations, saying, 'they must never ever, ever happen again'.

He told Sky News the revelations were 'appalling', adding: 'The BBC in particular has to learn 
lessons from this, I think they've come forward with the right approach,
 saying we will investigate, we'll do it properly'.

Sir Michael Lyons, who was chairman of the BBC Trust from 2007 to 2011, told Sky News: 'There may well be lessons here to learn about the way that we tolerate the behaviour of predatory men, particularly when they are in powerful positions.

'And there may be lessons to learn - I am sure there - about the license that we sometimes allow to celebrities. This goes well beyond the BBC although there are issues for the BBC to address.'

The veteran DJ in 2001 when he said he didn't care about his legacy in an interview

The late TV presenter said he did not care if he was remembered as a conning pervert and abuser when he died.

When asked the question by a reporter in an interview in 2001 when he was 74, he said: 'If I’m gone that’s that. B******s to my legacy.'

Savile's shameless attitude emerged when grilled about accusations he was a psychopath and paedophile, according to The People.

Instead of denying the claims, he said: 'Whatever is said after I'm gone is irrelevant'.

After being asked if he was 'into little girls', he said: 'I’d rather not even opinionate on this. I’ll leave it to the psychologists to sort out the psychology of child abuse.'

He then reportedly joked about the issue, claiming he hated children.
