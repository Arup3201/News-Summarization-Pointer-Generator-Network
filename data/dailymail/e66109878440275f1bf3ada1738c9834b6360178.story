England showed yet again that they are competitive but they are still not unleashing the full potential of this group.

Our traditional strengths are all there and in many ways we fronted up really well.

The front five, the scrums, the lineout are going well.

It’s outside that we have problems — we are not playing enough real footballers in the backs to take on Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, which has to be the goal.

The England team are not a development team. We can’t go on talking about our young inexperienced players at this level. It’s totally irrelevant, it’s a decision that England are making and they must not be putting caveats in place.

Have we got players who can go head to head with the world’s best? Yes, absolutely. But in the back division we are not currently playing in a way that will consistently pose these big teams problems. 

We are either not picking the right players or not picking the right combination of players in the positions where they can cause the most damage.

More experienced players - different options - are available all across the team: Danny Cipriani, Steffon Armitage and James Haskell, to name just three. There are a whole bunch of more experienced players out there.

We keep getting close on the scoreboard but in the cold light of day there is still a gap. The England coaches have got to be more clear on how they see England playing the game.

What to do now against Samoa? There is talk of changes but what I would do is pick the ‘Gun’ XV that England want to start against Australia, which has now become an absolutely must-win game.

That might well involve a few changes but England should not make switches of personnel just for the sake of it. This is actually not the time to experiment or rest players by some pre-planned strategy. Now is the time to pick the team you expect to beat Australia. Stuart Lancaster should make those changes because he has a vision of the team he wants to run out against the Wallabies in two weeks’ time.

Danny Cipriani, behind Owen Farrell and George Ford at fly half in the pecking order, has attacking flair

Toulon's Steffon Armitage and Wasps' James Haskell are among a host of experienced players available 

If they pick the core of this team again I would tighten things up, kick for the corners more, turn teams with kicks and try to pin the opposition in their 22 for huge chunks of the game. Ruthlessly use the strength of the pack and their ability to control a game.

Personally I would always go for a more attacking option because against the very best I have always felt you need that but there is not a right or a wrong selection, there is just the selection that works. At this level there is only one thing on which you are judged: did you win or not? But England have got to start being very clear in what they are looking for.

It was care's pass that gifted Jan Serfontein the only try of the first half

I am increasingly impressed with Joe Marler and David Wilson in the England front row and on this occasion I’m opting for Marler, who is developing very quickly indeed at loose head in the absence of the injured Alex Corbisiero. 

England’s scrum has been reassuringly rock solid so far this autumn against New Zealand and South Africa and that is a great base for a team to work off.

England have also done well in the line-outs - they lost just one I can remember on Saturday - so Marler is clearly supporting his jumpers well there. 

His all-round contribution has been excellent and what I particularly like about the Marler we are seeing this season is that he seems to have reined in what used to be a short fuse and his entire focus is going into the game.

MY CHAMPAGNE MOMENT 

There's only one real contender and that is Cobus Reinach’s wonderful try more or less straight after the second half began, which put the Boks in the box seat.

The skill of Pat Lambie’s chip ahead off the outside of his right foot was exquisite while Willie le Roux is such a consummate player that you always fancied him to catch it on the full and make ground.

And then it got even better. He waited and waited to draw the England defence, then released Reinach at exactly the right moment for a score that would grace any highlights reel. It was a breathtaking moment that demonstrated what South Africa can do and why they are the No2 team in the world.

Referee Steve Walsh rightly sends Hartley to the bin

Steve Walsh had a mixed game when it came to the big calls, in my opinion.

He got the yellow card absolutely right with Dylan Hartley after reviewing the big screen. Those sorts of yellow cards really annoy a coach - it was unnecessary.

England were winning the ball anyway, routine ruck possession, but when you ruck these days the movement of the foot has to be backwards, not down.

But Walsh and his team got the call against Bryan Habana soon after badly wrong when he clearly fielded the ball with one foot in touch. 

It should have been a lineout back in England’s half, Boks throwing in. Instead it was an attacking lineout for England in South Africa’s half and it led directly to England’s first try.

It was a big momentum changer and I have no idea why Walsh did not ask for TMO adjudication on that one.
