The moment a killer whale is born has been captured on video at a San Diego attraction.

Kasatka the killer whale gave birth to a 7 feet long , 350 pounds baby killer whale after an almost 18-month gestation.

The newborn killer whale calf was born at Shamu Stadium, SeaWorld San Diego, under the watchful eyes of the SeaWorld's zoological team members after more than an hour of labour.

Seconds later, the baby whale - the sixth successful killer whale birth in the park's 49-year history -  instinctively swam to the water's surface to take its first breath.

The park's zoological team members report the mother and baby appear to be healthy, but as with any newborn, the first few days are critical, with the calf's sex is yet to be determined

Mike Scarpuzzi, vice president of zoological operations said: 'The mother and baby appear to be doing very well and our initial observations indicate this is a strong healthy calf.'
