The federal air marshall who sheltered George Zimmerman for six-weeks after he shot Trayvon Martin appeared on Dr. Phil last night to say that his friend would be dead unless he had killed the Florida teenager.

Mark Osterman, 44, a former Seminole County deputy who now lives in Lake Mary, appeared on the nationally syndicated television show and said that the Martin would have continued to ram his friends head against the floor and that Zimmerman's 'believes he would not be alive today', if he had not fired his own gun at the 17-year-old.

On the program to plug their new book, 'Defending our Friend: The Most Hated Man in America', Osterman and his wife Sondra denied that Zimmerman, 28, was a 'Rambo' type of vigilante and claimed that he was 'heartbroken and devastated' over the killing.

George Zimmerman's best friend Mark Osterman has appeared on Dr. Phil to defend him from accusations that he was a racist and murdered 17-year-old Trayvon Martin

Caring for Zimmerman at their Lake Mary home while a $10,000 bounty was put on his head by the New Black Panthers following the February 26th shooting, Mark and Sandra Osterman claimed that their friend acted in self-defence and would have died had Martin continued to slam his head against the ground.

'The injuries that he had to his head could not be sustained for any period of time without either becoming unconscious or dying,' said the husband and wife to Dr. Phil.

The couple told Dr. Phil that they had known Zimmerman for six-years and described him as a 'nice, loving, sweet guy.'

'I am 100 percent convinced that he is completely innocent, that he stood his ground, that he was entitled to do so,' said Mark Osterman.

The Ostermans added that it is a fact that Martin caused Zimmerman a concussion and would not have survived the assault if he hadn't shot Martin in the chest with his own weapon.

'There is no upside to this,' said Osterman.

'From what George told me, he believes he would not be alive today if he had not done that.

'According to what he told me, there was no time to think.'

George Zimmerman, a Florida Neighbourhood Watch volunteer is currently free on $1 million bail while he awaits trial for the second-degree murder of Trayvon Martin.

Zimmerman has repeatedly said he killed the Miami Gardens teenager in self-defence.

Mark Osterman is the first person that Zimmerman's wife Shellie called for help on February 26th following the shooting and Osterman went to the scene, accompanied Zimmerman to police interviews and took in the couple for six weeks as the case exploded into a national story.

Osterman has already been interviewed by the FBI and Florida Department of Law Enforcement on April 26th and most of what he repeated on television has been released prior to Zimmerman's trial.

The federal air marshall has told agents that he taught Zimmerman how to shoot and that they even picked out the gun that killed Trayvon and went to the local gun range together around once a month.

He vehemently denied that his friend profiled Trayvon as the prosecution claim and that he was a bigot.

'Is he a racist?' said Dr. Phil.

'Absolutely not,' replied Osterman.

'Is he a cowboy vigilante?' said Dr. Phil.

'Absolutely not,' said Osterman.

The former police officers friendship with Zimmerman is controversial because many believe that he has coached Zimmerman on what to tell police.

Indeed, the lead Stanford police investigator has said that Zimmerman's account of the shooting has sounded like it is scripted, which has led many to believe that Osterman has been behind his friends carefully constructed defence.

Mark and Sondra Osterman told Dr. Phil that they are writing the book to raise funds for Zimmerman's defence.

However, Zimmerman's legal team took to Twitter to put distance between themselves and the Ostermans.

'Osterman's book and TV spot, although well-intentioned, are ill-timed and done without input and NOT approved by the defence.'

In addition to the Osterman's Trayvon's step-mother, Alicia Stanley made an emotional appearance on the television show.

'You sit her like you were proud: 'I picked that gun out.' she said to the Osterman's fighting through tears.

Support: Osterman accompanied Zimmerman to every police interrogation about the Martin shooting

'Why would you want people to know that? I know he's your friend, but that don't mean he's not a liar.'

Zimmerman claims he killed Trayvon because the unamrmed teen attacked him and during the assault tried to take his gun from him.

Interviews released after the April round of interviews Osterman completed with the FBI and Florida Department of Law Enforcement reveal his concerns for his life.

‘Zimmerman is frustrated with the new Black Panther party and is very scared of them,' said Osterman to the FBi and FDLE.

‘Zimmerman is very concerned with all the negative reaction from the press and others and wants more evidence released to show what really happened.’

Mr Osterman’s dubious employment history is also included in the notes. During his time as a deputy at the Seminole County sheriff's office, he was pressured to quit after he and another officer were fooled into working as security guards for a con man.

The man, named Juan Diaz, approached Mr Osterman and another officer saying he was a second baseman for the New York Yankees and asked them to work as his body guard while going to strip clubs and bars in Florida.

Mr Osterman resigned in 1998 after an administrative panel suggest he be fired because they did not get the bureaucratic approval to work an off-duty security shift.

Since 2001, he has worked for the Department of Homeland Security as an air marshal, and on Facebook he describes his job as involving ‘lots of shooting and traveling’.
