Blackpool are in talks to sign Chelsea's Islam Feruz after his proposed deal at Cardiff City fell through.

Feruz had returned to Stamford Bridge after failing to convince Cardiff to take him on loan.

Feruz, 19, was poised to join the Bluebirds despite initially seeming reluctant to make the move after his representatives indicated the player was not keen on the south Wales club.

The Scotland Under-21 international had a change of heart and opted to train with the club for a week but Cardiff boss Russell Slade has since confirmed the player will not be joining his side.

'We have made a decision on Islam and he's gone back to Chelsea,' Slade said.

Somalian-born Feruz spent the first half of the season on loan at Greek side OFI Crete
