The family of the late Norman Rockwell has taken exception to a new biography of the American illustrator, saying it contains numerous inaccuracies and poses a ‘phantom theory’ about his sexuality.

American Mirror: The Life And Art Of Norman Rockwell, by Deborah Solomon, was published in November.

In a statement released by the Norman Rockwell Family Agency on December 23, family members said they found at least 96 factual errors in the book, that the author misused sources and made ‘highly selective’ use of Rockwell's own autobiography My Adventures As An Illustrator.

Rockwell, who lived in Stockbridge, Mass., illustrated more than 300 covers for the Saturday Evening Post. He died in 1978.

The family, in its statement, referred to one passage in the book in which Solomon describes how Rockwell went to schools at recess and stopped little boys on the street, and that such behavior might be seen as problematic in today's world.

The passage ignores Rockwell's own explanation in his autobiography that after he persuaded a boy to pose for an illustration, they would go together to ask the child's mother for permission, the family said.

‘She supports this unfounded claim with another phantom theory, that Rockwell was a closeted homosexual,’ the statement read. ‘To link pedophilia and homosexuality in this way is offensive and clearly homophobic.’

In an interview in October with The Wall Street Journal, Solomon, who also authored biographies of artists Jackson Pollack and Joseph Cornell, was quoted as saying she did not believe Rockwell had homosexual relationships in his life, but added that he preferred male company and that it was possible to discern ‘enormous homo-eroticism’ from his work.

In The Runaway, a painting of a burly cop and a little boy on adjacent cafe stools, the cop leans toward the boy ‘as if to emphasize the... tenderness that can form between a grown man and a little boy... the hint of homo-eroticism’ she writes.

In Girl At Mirror,’ a young girl in a white slip studies her own reflection — ‘Actually,’ says Solomon, ‘seen from the back, she could be a boy.’ And the girl’s doll, tossed on the floor? ‘A bizarrely sexualized object. With her right hand buried in her petticoats, the doll could almost be masturbating.’

She said she was not attempting to speculate on his psychology.

The author did not understand Rockwell as a person, the family said, and dismissed suggestions that he was lonely, moody or frequently depressed.

‘This is absurd. He did not mope, was not a chronic depressive, or a hypochondriac. He went through his trials and storms as we all do, but he was someone who ultimately affirmed life,’ read the statement signed by Rockwell's son, Thomas, and granddaughter, Abigail.

The statement, issued by The Norman 
Rockwell Family Agency, was released on December 23 in response to a 
number of reviews that the agency found were to ready to accept 
Solomon’s version of events.

The family also said it was troubled that the Norman Rockwell Museum, located in Stockbridge, had endorsed the book.

In an Oct. 11 news release announcing an upcoming appearance by Solomon, Laurie Norton Moffatt, the museum's director, called the book ‘a well-researched and written biography that presents many unique theories and interpretations about the artist.’

In a statement provided to the Berkshire Eagle, the museum said it was a center for academic freedom and for scholarship about Rockwell's life and that American Mirror was one in a long line of books about the artist.

Author Solomon accuses Rockwell of being gay, even though he was married three times including to Miss Mary Rhoades

Many of the reviews of Deborah Solomon's American Mirror The Life And Art Of Norman Rockwell have accepted her account of his life and work. Her account is essentially wrong.

She has neglected or misused the sources which she cites. Her use of Norman Rockwell's autobiography, My Adventures As An Illustrator, is highly selective. As Professor Patrick Toner of Wake Forest University states in his online review on First Things.com, ‘Solomon has a pronounced tendency to either distort or simply ignore evidence to the contrary.’

Garrison Keillor states in today’s review (published in the New York Times on Dec 19), ‘She does seem awfully eager to find homoeroticism – poor Rockwell cannot go on a fishing trip without his biographer finding sexual overtones.’

Keillor comments on Solomon’s suggestion that the doll in Girl At Mirror could be masturbating, ‘Well, I suppose that Michelangelo’s David could “almost” be masturbating’.

On page 94 of her book, Solomon describes how Rockwell would ‘hang about the schools at recess . . and stop little boys on the street . .’

She then comments, ‘Today with our awareness of pederasty scandals (meaning pedophilia) this kind of behavior might seem problematic . .’ She then omits a passage just below this in the Autobiography that fully explains what really happened – after Rockwell would convince a boy to pose, they would go to ask the mother's permission.

On page 101 she comments on his relationship with his models: ‘The integrity of the boys was never in question. But his own character was not nearly so straightforward.’

Referring to Nabokov's novel, Lolita, Solomon writes, ‘In a way Rockwell was Humbert Humbert’s discreet and careful twin brother, roused by the beauty of children but (thankfully) more repressed.’

Many of the reviewers have ignored the claim of pedophilia, perhaps because the suggestion of it blows the credibility of the book out of the water. 

The Tattoo Artist by Norman Rockwell: Solomon now claims that sex is only a 'tiny part' of her book

She supports this unfounded claim with another phantom theory, that Rockwell was a closeted homosexual. To link pedophilia and homosexuality in this way is offensive and clearly homophobic. We have found at least 68 of these sexual references throughout the book.

On page 168 she comments on his search for costumes for his models: ‘. . . he did enjoy acquiring clothing from men who caught his eye, as if it were possible to acquire the less tangible parts of them as well.’

Solomon now claims that sex is only a ‘tiny part’ of her book. But sex is a major theme of the book and her phantom theories color and distort everything, including Rockwell’s entire character and her interpretations of his art.

There is no way to separate her sexual theories from the rest of the book. Her take on Freedom of Speech is that the man standing is ‘unattached and sexually available. Unbuttoned and unzipped.’

Solomon also omits from the Autobiography many accounts of Norman Rockwell's feelings and relationships with women.

There are also many other factual errors and omissions - we have found at least 96. Again, this is something that few reviewers seem to notice - they simply do not know enough about Norman Rockwell's life, and are too dependent on Solomon's flawed account.

She inadequately interviewed Rockwell's three sons and therefore her account of his life is often inaccurate. She gives an incomplete account of a significant difficulty with the Post when the art editor, Ken Stuart, painted out a horse from one of NR's covers without consulting him.

Solomon omits Norman Rockwell’s difficulties when his abilities were failing - in one instance he painted portraits of the Ross Perot family and they were so badly done that Mr. Perot sent them back and NR returned his check.

Most important of all, Solomon doesn't understand the man, who Norman Rockwell was as a person. She says ‘On most days he was lonesome and loveless.’ This is absurd. He did not mope, was not a chronic depressive, or a hypochondriac. He went through his trials and storms as we all do, but he was someone who ultimately affirmed life.

People liked Rockwell and enjoyed being with him. He was interested in people and what they had to say. On a personal note, I always had a wonderful relationship with my father, we were especially close when I helped him with his Autobiography.

Solomon claims that her book is based on an examination of his art and that Norman Rockwell painted mostly men and boys. We counted all the Post covers from 1916 - 1951 and all the early covers for Life and Literary Digest. There are 172 covers with girls and women, and 141 covers with boys and men. Her theory is demonstrably wrong. Norman Rockwell also did 9 covers of Santa Claus. We're not sure in which category Solomon would place Santa.

We are troubled and mystified that the Norman Rockwell Museum at Stockbridge has endorsed the book.

This is our last word, we are no longer going to participate in the drama Solomon has created. This book says a lot more about Deborah Solomon than it does about Norman Rockwell.
