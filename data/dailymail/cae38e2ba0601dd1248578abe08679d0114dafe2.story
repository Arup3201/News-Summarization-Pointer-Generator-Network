Former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords' astronaut husband Mark Kelly and his identical twin brother have been selected to take part in an experiment which will study the impacts of space life on the body.

Mark Kelly flew on four space shuttle missions before retiring in October 2011 to spend more time with his wife, Ms Giffords, after she was shot while meeting with constituents earlier that year.

His identical brother Scott continues to be an active astronaut and is set to live on the International Space Station for a year starting in spring 2015.

One of these things is not like the other: Mark Kelly (right) and his identical twin brother Scott (left) will take part in a study on how space life impacts the body

The experiment: Scott Kelly will live on the International Space Station for a year while his brother will stay on earth. Both will undergo the same periodic medical tests, one brother in space and the other on earth

During that year, both brothers will help researchers study how the human body reacts to space life, by undergoing periodic medical examinations.

Mark and Scott Kelly are good candidates for this type of research because they share practically the same DNA.

Any differences between them therefore can be attributed to their environmental differences.

'It offers an opportunity for an extra control to see if that can help us better understand this long-duration spaceflight process,' International Space Station program scientist Julie Robinson told Scientific American.

But other scientists are doubtful the experiment will yield any usable results since only one set of twins will be studied.

'This strikes me as a bit silly,' said Tim Spector of Kings College London, who founded the UK Twins Registry. 'You can compare the same person before and after [spaceflight] better than you can compare the person and their twin. If they'd taken both of them on the mission, the could have explored how similarly they behave.'

NASA admits that not all of the aspects of the experiment are ideal - since the Kelly brothers won't be able to keep the same diet, carbon dioxide levels and sleep schedule. 

'Obviously the sample groups have to have a certain number to be statically significant, so some of the science we're going is more anectodal,' Scott Kelly said. 'But you can learn something and maybe learn about certain phenomena that you would then decide to investigate further.'

The Kelly brothers were born in Orange, New Jersey and went on to be captains and test pilots in the U.S. Navy before eventually joining NASA in 1996.

Becoming an astronaut is an extremely difficult thing to do, and the fact that both of them made the cut 
shows just how important genetics can be. According to NASA, the idea 
for the experiment comes from the Kelly brothers themselves.

Despite having so much physically in common, the brothers say they are quite different people personality-wise.

'I'm the smarter of the two and the better-looking, with the more charming personality,' Scott recently joked. But in reality 'we're two individuals who were born on the same day from the same egg, but other than that we are two different people.'

The overarching goal of Scott Kelly's mission on the ISS is to study how the body reacts to long term space exposure.

The 2015 mission will be the first time astronauts have spent an entire year on the ISS. Scott Kelly will be joined on the ISS by Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko
