Terrifying new reports have revealed that farmers in New Zealand have been sent letters which threaten to contaminate baby formula, in an apparent protest against the use of pesticides.

Sent anonymously to Federation Farmers and Fonterra in November, the letters also included small packages of milk powder which were laced with concentrated 1080 poison, according to the NZ Herald.

Detailed in the letters were threats claiming that if New Zealand didn't stop using poison 1080 - a chemical used in pesticides - by the end of March the senders would contaminate baby and other formulas.

Letters sent to Federation Farmers in New Zealand last November contained threats to contaminate baby formula with poison 1080

Police are now appealing for the public's help in catching the letter senders. They launched their investigation in November, headed up by an Auckland-based team called Operation Concord and involving up to 36 police officers. 

New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key has described the attack as a 'form of ecoterrorism'.

'Police have advised there is a low likelihood of the threat being carried out, but because of the nature of it, both the police and ministers have taken the treat seriously,' Mr Key said in a press conference in Parliament according to the NZ Herald. 

He also added that testing through each step of the supply chain was carried out before the public was notified of the potential threat. 

Mike Clement, Police Deputy Commissioner of National Operations said the threat needed to be treated in a serious matter despite that fact it could be a hoax.

Mr Clement urged the person, or people, responsible for the distribution of the letters to make themselves known to police.

'The letter writer may not have really considered the implications of their actions when this communication was drafted,' Mr Clement said. 

No specific brand was targeted and officials say they are certain no formulas are currently contaminated

Ministry for Primary Industries Deputy Director General Scott Gallagher said he was sure that New Zealand baby and other formula was still safe despite the threats.

'This criminal threat is designed to cause fear in order to generate a domestic policy outcome,' Mr Gallagher also said. 

He also confirmed that there is currently no 1080 poison in any baby formula.

Mr Clement urged people to check packets for any signs of tampering or interference after 'this criminal blackmail threat', and said that no particular brand had been targeted.

As officials have been aware of the threat since last November, they are positive that there is currently no danger of contamination and in fact formulas are safer than ever due to stricter screening and control.

Global dairy company Fonterra said the whole industry is onside with the investigation, ready to assist police and government officials.

Chief executive Theo Spierings revealed the news of the threat made him 'quite angry.'
