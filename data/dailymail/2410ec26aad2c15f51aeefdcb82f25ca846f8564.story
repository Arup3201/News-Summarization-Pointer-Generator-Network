Almost three years ago Vlatka Dragic spontaneously quit her job and drove to Queensland where she started her own personal training business

At 25-years-old, Vlatka Dragic found herself spontaneously quitting her job and driving to Queensland with a friend, in search of warmwe weather and a healthier lifestyle.

Sick of the daily nine-to-five drudge, the Croatian-born beauty left her high-end career as an account manager for various supermarket brands and spent months in the sunny state desperately struggling to find employment.

Now, the 27-year-old from Biggera Waters is getting ready to compete professionally in the World Beauty Fitness and Fashion competition in Las Vegas after being crowned the Australian bikini champion in Queensland earlier this year.

'I did a double degree in business marketing and human marketing in Melbourne after high school and then I emailed the company I wanted to work for and I got an interview straight away and started working the next day,' Ms Dragic told Daily Mail Australia.

'I thought that's what I wanted to do and I liked it at first, but everyday working from eight to six and then driving three hours everyday to and from work - I had enough. I wanted to live in a tropical state where it was always sunny and get involved in fitness.'

Since moving to Queensland, Ms Dragic has not only become a healthier version of herself, but spends all her time inspiring others to do the same.

She's launched her own personal training business, written the Fitness Model Bible Ebook, made appearances across magazines and media and even been lucky enough to find her partner Andrew, a muscle model, who she plans to marry next year.

But there is a lot of hard work ahead for the fitness model, who will battle it out against 150 otherÂ  professional models from around the world for the $30,000 prize in the WBFF competition in the next few months.

Now Vlatka is getting ready to compete professionally in the World Beauty Fitness and Fashion competition in Las Vegas after being crowned the Australian bikini champion in Queensland in April

The competition, which will focus on her muscle tone and separation, means that Vlatka is on a strict 12-week diet and has to drink four litres of water a day

'I was never really overweight, but I was chubby. I wasn't toned,'Ms Dragic said of her transformation.

'We have to have really good muscle tone and muscle separation for the competition, which is really hard to get and involves 12 weeks of strict dieting.

'So all my meals are measured I have to eat specific fruits, I can't have any spices or sauces or fizzy drinks or artificials - because that way your body looks different - and I have to drink over four litres of water a day.'

The fitness model posted this picture to her Facebook page to show how her body appears depending on her diet and the level of her exercise plan

Ms Dragic also offered a few words of advice for others hoping to work their way to a fitter lifestyle and a healthier body.

'Start exercising and make sure you do weight training and cardio. If you want to get toned, it's essential to be on a high protein diet because you need to feed your muscles for them to grow,' she said.

Vlatka said that her move to Queensland also led her to meet her fiance Andrew, a muscle model who travels with her overseas
