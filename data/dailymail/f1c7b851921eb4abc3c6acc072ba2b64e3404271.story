The Premier League is providing more World Cup quarter finalists than any other league in the world - showing England's top clubs are still some of the best when it comes to world class quality.

But while English sides are proving to be the most collectively successful in Brazil so far, Bayern Munich - as they often do - are still top of the pile with 10 players left in the tournament.

The German champions started the World Cup with more players than anyone else, and many of them are still in with the national team - which alone boasts seven Bayern stars - making it through to the quarter finals.

Premier League's finest: Andre Schurrle and Mesut Ozil both scored for Germany in their last-16 tie

Spot on: Romelu Lukaku scored in the last round to help him and his Premier League team mates advance

Surprise package: Bryan Ruiz might have been out on loan but he's still England-based with Fulham

Blues brothers: Oscar and Ramires are among a host of Premier League players in Brazil's squad

Arsenal and Chelsea lead the way for the English, providing eight and seven players each - leaving them just behind the German champions.

Both Manchester clubs, London rivals Tottenham and Alan Pardew's Newcastle all make it into the top 20 clubs too.

Spain's World Cup flop appears to have cost their league giants Real Madrid and Barcelona places amongst the top ranking clubs - and if they had made it to this stage the traditional La Liga rivals could boast eight and nine participants respectively.

Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid amazingly fail to make the list of the World Cup's top 20 clubs while La Liga registers as just the fifth best league in the world behind England, Germany, Italy and France.

The figures fuel the long running argument over which country boasts the best league. While the Premier League has long sold itself as the best around, back-to-back all-German and all-Spanish Champions League finals have brought the claim into question.

And the English clubs will undoubtedly be able to show off even more top talent after what looks to be a busy summer of transfer activity for the big clubs, although none of the players listed here will be keen to talk about that sort of thing with the focus still on international glory.
