The cost of converting the Olympic Stadium for use by West Ham could rise by £15 million due to problems involving the construction of a new roof.

According to Sky Sports News, the total cost of the stadium could reach £600 million - twice the original cost in London's 2012 bid, once a new roof and retractable seating to cover the running track have been installed.

The original stadium was not intended to be used as a Premier League ground and initially cost £429 million with the conversion expected to involve a further £154 million before complications arose.

Grounds for complaint: The Olympic Stadium could cost an additional £15m to convert into West Ham's home

The London Legacy Development Corporation is confident that the increase will be covered by savings elsewhere and is intending to hold contractors Balfour Beatty to its fixed-price contract.

In a statement the LLDC said: 'The Legacy Corporation and its contractors are working closely together to convert the Stadium from its Games-time mode into a multi-use, year round venue.

'It is a highly complex scheme and subject to tight project management to ensure that all the risks and issues are properly managed, as would be expected on a fixed price contract and an undertaking of this scope and scale.'

House warming: West Ham are expected to move into the Olympic Stadium for the 2016-17 season

The potential cost increase has been raised to allow the stadium structure to be strengthen to support he weight of the new roof. 

West Ham won the bid to be anchor tenants after a bitter dispute with London neighbours Tottenham.

The stadium was expected to be re-opened for a Diamond athletics meeting next summer and five Rugby World Cup matches in the autumn, before West Ham move in for the 2016-17 season.
