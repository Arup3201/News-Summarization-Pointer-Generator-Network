High end: Restauranter Nino Selimaj with the Bellisima Pizza in New York

A luxurious caviar pizza costing $1,000 has proved a hit after being added to a New York restaurant's menu.

The extravagant pie is the creation of New York restauranteur Nino Selimaj, owner of Nino's Bellissima Pizza in Manhattan.

Most of the price-tag comes in the hefty serving of caviar which tops the pizza, which in itself costs $820.

Hundreds of people have already bought the decadent dish, which is among the most expensive pizzas in the world.

Two of the world's top caviars, Beluga, and the intensely-flavoured Black Russian Royal Sevruga, are among the varieties selected for Nino's creation.

The fish flavour is further enhanced by thinly sliced lobster and creme fraiche, and topped off with a salmon roll, chives and wasabi paste.

Nino, who owns five restaurants in the city, said: 'I've been in the city for 33 years and I serve caviar in all my restaurants.

'I wanted something different for my pizza restaurant.

'I didn't want just a traditional marinara or margherita. I wanted something specific and unique and so I came up with the $1,000 pizza, and it's worth every penny.'

Nino has been serving up the pizza fit for Russian tzars for four years, and still prepares around one a week for caviar devotees.

He spent three months trialling different ingredients including white truffles and olive oil, before coming up with the perfect caviar, lobster and creme fraiche mix.

Nino said: 'There was a bit of a slow down with the economy, but we're still selling around 50 a year.

'The
 price of caviar has actually increased too, so people are getting more 
for their money, and my profit margin on the pizza has decreased.

'People who know about their caviar love this pizza. We sell them to politicians, Wall Street traders, or couples celebrating a birthday or anniversary.

'It is definitely a pizza for people who like caviar. People who don't like caviar think it is outrageous, and crazy to pay this much.

'But diners always see it on the menu and ask about it, why it is so expensive and how many we sell. People are always curious.'

The New York offering has a rival with a pizza chain along the Canadian coast is offering a lobster, cod and caviar pizza.

Unfortunately
 for Steveston Pizza Co, which has three restaurants, 
including a branch in Vancouver, has only had one taker for its $450 effort.

Canadian take away Steveston Pizza Co has listed on its menu as C6 a $450 pizza that comes topped with Thermidor of Lobster, black Alaskan cod and Russian Osetra caviar side

Listed
 on their menu as their C6, the pie comes topped with Thermidor of 
Lobster and black Alaskan cod along with a side of Russian Osetra 
caviar.

Their sole consumer, described in three words by the pizzeria's owner, was simply put as 'a very rich person.'

Restaurant owner Nader Hatami said: 'The idea was the make a culinary statement. I don't know if you've tried our pizza but each one is pretty unique.'

With
 a seasonally-changing menu, largely organic ingredients and 'very good 
cheese,' pizzas on Mr Hatami's menu ranges from $14 to the high 
$20s, with the exception of one currently selling for $120 that has already been ordered seven times.

But neither Steveston Pizza Co or Nino's Bellissima Pizza are selling the world's most expensive pizza.

The current record holder according to the World Records Academy is a restaurant in Malta which sold its special effort for for $2,380 in 2010.

The pricey thin crust pizza, topped
 with white truffles, a 24-carat gold leaf and buffalo mozzarella, was sold at Margo's Pizzeria on the Mediterranean island.

Restaurateur Claude Camilleri said: 'We're trying to draw attention to the quality of the food. Having truffles on a pizza which is not the best pizza possible would be a travesty, a sin.

'And to put truffles on a Margo's pizza, you need to be confident that what you are creating is an exceptional masterpiece.'
