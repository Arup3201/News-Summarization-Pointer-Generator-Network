Saeed Ajmal, comfortably the best spinner in the world before he was banned for chucking, could complete a remarkable comeback with a World Cup call-up.

Ajmal was cleared by the International Cricket Council on Saturday after remedial work on his suspect bowling action and could now be fast-tracked into the Pakistan squad if they need to replace an injured player.

Mohammad Hafeez, himself banned from bowling in the ICC purge on illegal actions, has a foot problem has been ruled out so Pakistan will consider a return for a controversial cricketer who would find himself under the microscope here.

‘There are a lot of ifs and buts because he hasn’t played any cricket but let’s see how things go in the next week,’ said Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq.

‘He’s been bowling a lot of deliveries in the nets every day but we haven’t sat down and talked about it yet. Let’s see what he has to do.’

It remains to be seen whether Saeed, at 37, can be as effective with a remodelled action and being under constant scrutiny from umpires who would be allowed to call or report him if they felt he transgressed again.

But the possibility of his call-up is intriguing. Without Ajmal and Hafeez they are short of quality spin and there is no doubt that he would strengthen a side looking to repeat their World Cup win in Australia 23 years ago.

‘The major concern for us and him is his lack of competitive cricket for the last five or six months,’ said Misbah here in Sydney ahead of this week’s World Cup warm-up games. ‘It’s a tough decision.’

For now the familiar figure of Shahid Afridi, better known for his explosive hitting, will have to step up as Pakistan’s main spinner in his fifth World Cup, a challenge he is relishing.

‘For the last few years myself, Saeed and Ajmal have done well as a bowling unit and the pressure will be on me now because the other two are not with me,’ said Afridi, who will face England at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Wednesday.

‘But I’m enjoying my bowling. I have played a lot of cricket for Pakistan but I have a big responsibility in this tournament as a senior player. This is not the time to give up. This is the time to give something to my country.’
