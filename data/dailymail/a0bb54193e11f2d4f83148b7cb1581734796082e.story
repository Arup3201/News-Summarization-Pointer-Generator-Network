A meeting between Anders Breivik and an English anti-Islamic militant calling himself ‘Richard the Lionheart’ was outlined in court yesterday.

Nine years before his killing spree left 77 dead, the Norwegian said he was sitting in a London cafe with members of an extremist group called Knights Templar, to plot ‘how to seize power in Western Europe’.

As well as ‘Richard the Lionheart’, Breivik was also ‘ordained’ by the group and given the name of the 12th-century Norwegian king, Sigurd ‘the Crusader’.

Defiant: Breivik, for a third day running, pumped his fist out in front of him as he took to the stand to answer questions

Under cross-examination on the third 
day of his trial yesterday, the right-wing extremist initially refused 
to discuss meetings in Liberia and London in April and May 2002 as he 
joined a network of ‘like-minded’ militant anti-Muslim nationalists.

But after repeated questioning by 
prosecutor Inga Bejer Engh, who told him she was trying to shed doubt on
the network’s existence, he conceded he had travelled to Africa and 
London ten years ago to help set up his Knights Templar (KT) movement.

For the first time Breivik, 33, 
appeared rattled as it emerged he left Oslo on April 17, 2002, to fly to
the Ivory Coast before entering Liberia, posing as an aid worker. 
Breivik said that once there he met an exiled Serbian ‘war hero’, but 
refused to identify the man.

Breivik became agitated and claimed 
Norwegian police had not been clever enough to uncover the KT movement’s
members. He said: ‘Exactly what is it you’re getting at? Are you trying
to sow doubt over whether the KT network exists? It does.’

The court heard that Breivik flew to 
London in late April 2002 where he attended a founding session of the KT
movement but he refused to give exact details of his co-conspirators.

As images of Breivik’s 1,800-page 
manifesto were flashed on to screens, the court heard that he met three 
other founding members of the Knights Templar during his London visit. 
At 23, he was the youngest member of the group.

There were two Englishmen – including
his ‘mentor’, Richard the Lionheart – and a French nationalist at the 
founding meeting. Breivik told the court: ‘It is not in my interest here
to discuss what went on.

What I will say is that Richard was responsible for calling the meeting.’ 
In his manifesto, Breivik said: ‘It was basically a long-term plan on how to seize power in Western Europe.’

He told the court that the people he 
had met in London had ‘great integrity’ and how his codename of 
‘Crusader’ was taken from Sigurd Magnusson, a 12th-century Viking king.

Asked if he felt he had met some 
‘like-minded friends’ in London, he said: ‘I felt I was a foot soldier 
associated with the others. Now I feel I have managed to do what I 
wanted to do.’

Breivik also said he should face the death penalty – describing the 21 years he faces in prison as ‘pathetic’.

When asked if he thought Norway should introduce the death penalty, he replied: ‘It would be the right thing.’
