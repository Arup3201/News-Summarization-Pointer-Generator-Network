Only ghostly reminders now remain where once there would have been rows upon rows of sick patients.

New photographs have emerged of the long-abandoned St Gerard's Hospital in Warwickshire which for decades treated thousands of children struck down with potentially deadly TB.

The site was closed in 1988 and has remained an eerie time warp to a period when the lethal bacterial infection that was spread by coughs and sneezes was endemic in Britain.

Decay: A ward in St. Gerard's Hospital in North Warwickshire, which was set up to treat TB, lies eerily silent having been abandoned in 1988

Haunting: Look past the flaking paint and crumbling ceilings and the building which was once St. Gerard's Hospital in North Warwickshire still bears the unmistakable signs of its previous use as a medical centre 

Hospital beds still litter the wards. Bloodstained syringes, old bathtubs, discarded photographs and keepsakes from former patients now gather dust. 

A catholic priest helped establish what eventually became St Gerard's Hospital at the beginning of the 19th century to treat local orphans and destitute children.

The facility soon became one of the centres treating TB - playing a part in helping to cut the number of cases from 50,000 a year in Britain in the 1950s, to 5,000 in the 1980s.

TB used to be known as consumption because the bacterium ate holes in the lungs.

From 50,000 cases a year in Britain in the 1950s, the rate fell to 5,000 in the 1980s.

It is a bacterial infection which is spread by inhaling drops of saliva when an infected person coughs, speaks or sneezes.

The
 disease mainly affects the lungs, but can travel to other parts of the 
body including the brain, kidneys, bones and joints.

The disease is 
curable with a six-month course of antibiotics, but a drug-resistant 
form can develop if the course is not completed.

Left untreated it can 
prove fatal.

Symptoms include a persistent cough that lasts for more 
than three weeks that gets progressively worse, unexplained weight loss,
 fever, night sweats, chest pain, fatigue and loss of appetite.

However,
 many people who are infected never develop symptoms - although the 
bacteria remain in the body, they are not infectious.

During the 1940s, when tuberculosis was widespread it was common to see 'Spitting Prohibited' signs on the buses.

By 1990 the by-law was phased out, but a new sure in cases of TB has prompted some local authorities to again prohibit spitting in public places.

These eerie photographs were captured 
by an urban explorer known as Urbex-SW, who took up photography after 
becoming intrigued by the abandoned contents of the derelict houses 
close to his childhood home.

'These photographs show the hospital as it was when it was abandoned back in 1988,' says Urbex-SW.

'Medicine bottles, syringes, wheelchairs and hospital beds have all been left behind - all that's missing are the patients.

'You
 always see old mental asylums pop up in the media, but nobody really 
pays much attention to these small old hospitals that treated life 
threatening illnesses.

'It was a place that I couldn't resist visiting.

'The most interesting thing I saw inside was the old fashioned wheelchair, as it's not something you see every day.

'Hospital beds are pretty much the same, but you could tell straight away that the wheelchairs dated back a fair few years.'

St.
 Gerard's Hospital was built during the 1900s, and was used for the 
treatment of tuberculosis and more specifically for practice in the 
field of orthopedics.

The 
building still features its original barn like doors, which could be 
fully opened to allow air into the building or even wheel the hospital 
beds out into the open.

'With
 locations like this, most people are shocked to see hospital equipment 
dating back to the 1900s just left behind rotting away.

'There were loads of hospital beds, drawings by previous patients and a few post cards.

'There were also old X-Ray images, cameras and even medicine bottles, just left behind for the foreseeable future.'

St
 Gerard’s Orthopaedic Hospital was part of Father Hudson's Society which
 was set up to offer services for orphaned children and pupils at local 
boys' school in the early to mid 1900's.

Father
 Hudson was The Birmingham Diocesan Rescue Society for the protection of
 homeless and friendless catholic children first secretary and 
administrator.

Under his 
stewardship the organisation set out to build hospitals and care 
facilities for children from all catholic homes in the diocese and the 
catholic children from the workhouse hospitals.

Hopes
 that the disease could be completely eliminated were dashed in the 
1980s with the rise of drug-resistant strains.

Tuberculosis cases in 
Britain, numbering around 117,000 in 1913, had fallen to around 5,000 in
 1987, but cases rose again, reaching 6,300 in 2000 and 7,600 cases in 
2005.
