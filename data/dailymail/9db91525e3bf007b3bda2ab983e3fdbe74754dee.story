A shocking YouTube video has surfaced apparently showing a man brazenly smoking the drug ice inside a public train on a sunny day.

The footage begins inside the carriage of a train passing Hawthorne station, in Melbourne's eastern suburbs. The camera zooms in on a shaven-headed man holding a glass pipe, using a jet lighter to heat the drug inside the pipe, before he inhales and blows smoke into the carriage in full view of other passengers.

At one stage of the video, the camera swoops across to the opposite side of the train, where a man, who could either be a passenger or an accomplice, grins at the scene. The ice smoker appears well-presented, wearing a Ralph Lauren polo shirt and chinos.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Victorian police for comment. 

Ice, also known as methamphetamine or crystal meth, has shot to the top of Australia's crime enforcement agenda, with the Australian Crime Commission declaring the country is in the grips of an ‘ice pandemic.’

The drug, which is highly addictive, can quickly cause brain damage comparable to Alzheimer’s disease, as well as violently psychotic behaviour and delusional paranoia.

Police also believe the purity of the drug on streets in increasing, which is causing the onset and severity of it's harmful symptoms to skyrocket.

In Victoria, the median purity level of ice bought on the streets has soared from 20 per cent two years ago to 76.1 per cent now.

Bikie gangs and other underworld syndicates are capitalising on the addictive nature of the drug by flooding the streets with ice, particularly in rural or suburban communities.

Ice is particularly prominent in Victoria, where regional ambulance call outs for ice related incidents increased by 200 per cent in regional Victoria between 2012 and 2013. 

The accessibility of Ice has led some experts to compare it to the issue of crack-cocaine in America. 

Last month the Australian Drugs Conference was held in Melbourne, where community leaders from Geelong, Mildura and Swan Hillmet to discuss the best approach to tackling the spread of the drug.
