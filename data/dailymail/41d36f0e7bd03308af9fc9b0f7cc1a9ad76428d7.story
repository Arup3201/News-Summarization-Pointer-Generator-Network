The depth of the relationship between Andrew Mitchell and Rwanda’s hardline leader was revealed yesterday as it emerged the senior Tory has visited the African state eight times in the past six years.

Mr Mitchell has been criticised by human rights groups for lifting a freeze on £16million of British aid to President Paul Kagame’s regime on his final day as International Development Secretary last month.

Documents released by the Department for International Development suggest Mr Mitchell  had promised Kagame he would continue pumping in aid money despite concerns about the regime’s dire human rights record.

Most of the visits related to Project Umabano, the voluntary project set up by Mr Mitchell and David Cameron in 2007 to help 'detoxify' their party's uncaring image

Mr Mitchell – now the Tory Chief Whip and recently in the spotlight over his alleged ‘plebs’ rant at No 10 police – is thought to have visited Rwanda at least eight times in six years, meeting Kagame and his ministers on several occasions.

Most of the visits related to Project Umabano, the voluntary project set up by Mr Mitchell and David Cameron in 2007 to help ‘detoxify’ their party’s uncaring image.

The revelations will focus fresh attention on the unlikely friendship between Mr Mitchell and Kagame, whose regime is accused of repression against political opponents at home and arming a murderous rebellion in the neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Internal DFID documents, released 
under the Freedom of Information Act, show that in a phone call in 
February 2011 the men discussed Mr Mitchell’s decision to increase aid 
to Rwanda from £60million a year to £90million, much of it poured into 
the Kagame regime’s coffers as ‘budget support’.

A memo recorded: ‘Secretary of State 
said this reflected the UK’s long-term support to Rwanda (including from
the PM, who had visited as leader of the Opposition in 2006).President 
Kagame was very grateful.'

Accused: President Kagame at Amahoro Stadium

Two months earlier Mr Mitchell had 
flown to Rwanda to see Kagame for a ‘90-minute tete-a-tete followed by 
lunch’ in which they had ‘friendly but robust’ exchanges.

That meeting followed Kagame’s controversial re-election with 93 per cent of the vote.

Mr Mitchell reluctantly froze the £16million aid payment to Rwanda after a devastating UN report on the regime’s support for the bloody rebellion in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Other major donors, including the US and Germany, have continued their aid bans.

But, in his final act as International Development Secretary, Mr Mitchell released the money.

A senior Foreign Office source called the decision a ‘mistake’.
