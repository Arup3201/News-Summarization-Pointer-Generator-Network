Controversial: Henry Armitage who wishes to exercise rights granted back in 1773

A 'Lord of the Manor' has upset his neighbours in a Cumbrian village by suddenly deciding that he wants to exercise ancient rights granted back in 1773.

Villagers in Preston Patrick were informed that that Henry Armitage and his mother Jennifer wanted to invoke a manorial right to ‘hunt, shoot and fish’ on their land.

Nearly 700 letters have been sent out by the Land Registry after the Armitage's requested their so-called ‘profit-à-prendre (right to take.)

This law legally entitles them to ‘a right
 of hunting, hawking, fishing and fowling’ as well as 38 further stipulations known as 'Deeds 
of Enfranchisement.'

They include the right to extract minerals.

One
 resident, retired call centre manager Ian Woods said: 'The rights have 
not been used for 200 years and the whole nature of the parish has 
changed enormously. It’s totally inappropriate in this day and age.

'I’d like to know what this means. It’s worrying, especially if they also grant a right to extract minerals.

Tony Mason, a teacher, said: 'I’m flabbergasted.

'It’s worrying that people are only 
being given three weeks by the Land Registry to respond to the letters 
with their objections.'

Paper mill worker Dave Denney, said the letter had left him feeling ‘anger and annoyance’.

'I
 think this is taking a liberty. I can only imagine they’ve gone to this
 trouble because there’s some financial gain to be had.'

The Preston Patrick rights were originally granted by Francis Charteris, of Horn-by Castle, to William Bateman, Thomas Cartmel, and Richard Wright, in 1773.

Disputed land: Residents have reacted furiously after being informed that the Armitage family wanted to invoke an ancient manorial right to 'hunt, shoot and fish' on their land

Backdated: The manorial rights for Preston Patrick were acquired by Mr Armitage's great-grandfather, Thomas Pumphrey, when he bought Preston Patrick Hall from the Lowther family in the 1920s

Preston Patrick hall has been a Grade 2 listed building since 1952.

The oldest part of the building is the hall block, which dates from the 14th century.

The pele tower was added later, probably during the early part of the 15th century, and is the right hand wing of the photo.

Records state that there was another tower on this site, and a curtain wall.

There was a court room in the right hand tower, where local Quakers were tried in the early days of the breakaway religion.

The name Preston Patrick is derived from 'Priest’s town' or 'Priest’s farm', and from Patrick de Curwen, an earlier owner of the manorial area.

Thomas Machell (1680-1690s) describes it as 'an old rambling house with (a) slender tower ouer the Gate'.

This may imply a gatehouse, in which case this may have been a courtyard house.

An indenture from the time says the Deeds of Enfranchisement were purchased by the men for ‘three thousand and five hundred and thirteen pounds eight shillings and one penny half-penny’.

The manorial rights for Preston Patrick were acquired by Mr Armitage’s great-grandfather, Thomas Pumphrey, when he bought Preston Patrick Hall from the Lowther family in the 1920s.

Yesterday, Mr Armitage insisted the application had been made to prevent ‘long-held rights being lost’, and was ‘not a precursor to any greater use’ of them.

Mr Armitage, of Kirkby Lonsdale, said: 'The current letters being sent out by the Land Registry reflect that we are reacting to the change in the law in order to protect an asset.

'The application being made is not a 
precursor to any greater use of these long-held rights, and the reason 
for the registration exercise is simply as a reaction to the change in 
the law to prevent the rights being lost.

'Due
 to the change, a large number of estates and other manorial owners are 
actively undertaking similar exercises to register their rights prior to
 October 2013.

'My mother Jennifer is in the process of transferring these rights to me.'

Upset residents: From left to right - Ian Woods, David Denney and Tony Mason. Mr Denney said: 'I think this is taking a liberty. I can only imagine they've gone to this trouble because there's some financial gain to be had'

Under the Land Registration Act 2002, the protected status of manorial rights will cease after October 2013, unless owners seek to register, or otherwise protect, them.

The Land Registry yesterday confirmed an application had been received from the Armitages, and it was in the process of sending out letters to all property and land owners in Preston Patrick parish.

Westmorland and Lonsdale MP Tim Farron has written to the Land Registry asking for an extension of the time limit for responses to give Preston Patrick residents a chance to organise a community response.

He also wants all relevant documents to be made available for inspection in South Lakeland, rather than Plymouth.
