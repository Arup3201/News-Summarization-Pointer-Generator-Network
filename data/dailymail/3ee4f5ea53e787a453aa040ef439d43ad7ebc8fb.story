A newborn baby boy of a pregnant woman killed  by stray gunfire on Sunday has also died, authorities said today.

Megan Doto, 26, whom police said was an innocent bystander during a drive-by shooting, was eight-months pregnant.

The mother-of-two was shot while sitting outside a home in north-east Philadelphia when someone opened fire on the block shortly before 11am.

Megan Doto, pictured with her two children, was baby-sitting the seven-year-old daughter of a neighbor when she was shot on Sunday morning in Philadelphia

Police believe the gunman’s target was the man sitting next to Doto but the bullets missed their intended target and one hit the young mother's right cheek. 

'She was not the intended target; she was just unfortunately in the wrong place at the wrong time,' Police Captain Stephen Murianka told Philly.com.

Doto was rushed to Temple University Hospital where she died from her injuries shortly after midday. Doctors performed an emergency c-section to try to save her baby boy.

The child, who Doto had planned to name Carmine Joseph, was due in October.

Doto, who has two other young children, was watching the seven-year-old daughter of a neighbor when the shooting occurred.

The man sitting beside Doto told Action News that he tried to save Doto life while he waited for an ambulance to arrive.

‘I took my hoodie off, I put in on her face to apply pressure. The cops showed up and after that the cops decided to put her in their car because it was going to be too long for the ambulance,' he said.

No weapon has been recovered but police found two dozen shell casings a block away from the shooting.

No arrests have been made but police said the shooter possibly fled in possibly a Chevy Impala or a late model white Ford Crown Victoria with tinted windows.

The mother-of-two had been excitedly posting pictures of her growing bump on social media alongside her partner.  

Ms Doto, 26, and her partner were said to be excitedly awaiting the birth of her third child, a son, in October
