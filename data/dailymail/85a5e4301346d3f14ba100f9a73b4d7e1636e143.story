President Barack Obama has saluted the 2013 Major League Soccer champions Sporting Kansas City. He credits the 'dedicated fans' of Kansas City for helping the sport grow in the United States.

Obama paid tribute to the team Wednesday for winning the MLS trophy 10 months ago in a freezing penalty kick shootout.

Obama singled out Kansas City defender Matt Besler and midfielder Graham Zusi, who were on the U.S. Men's National Team for this summer's World Cup in Brazil.

The president also noted that Kansas City was enjoying a banner athletic week. 

The Kansas City Royals won the American League wild card game Tuesday and the NFL Kansas City Chiefs defeated the New England Patriots Monday.

Obama said: 'Clearly something is going on in Kansas City.'

Even the championship game itself, the president gushed, was special--and especially frigid.

'When the game started, the temperature was just 20 degrees; by the end, it was just 10 degrees.

'That was after 120 minutes of soccer and the longest penalty shootout—10 rounds—in MLS Cup history.'

Joining the president and Sporting Kansas City in the  East Room of the White House were a group of very lucky young lady soccer players from Stone Ridge of the Sacred Heart in Bethesda.

The varsity and junior varsity players looked thrilled to be in the White House as they jostled to shake the president's hand.

One especially thrilled girl snapped up an opportunity to take an extra special selfie, with the Commander-in-chief in the background.
