It's certainly a novel way to get through a jam if you're running late - but don't try it anytime soon. This man bizarrely decided to ride an electric tricycle against the heavy traffic on an overpass yesterday in Jinan, Shandong province, China. Wearing a pink polo shirt and black trousers, the driver weaved around the other vehicles as motorists tried to get out of his way. A
report in the People's Daily of China said the 'crazy and dangerous' 
escapade saw him change lanes 'many times' as other vehicles had to 
'flee'. It's not yet known if the man, who appeared to be carrying goods on the vehicle, was stopped by local authorities.
