He should be focusing all his attention on tonight’s crucial match with arch-rivals Wales. 

But England rugby captain Chris Robshaw is clearly facing a few distractions at home as he prepares for the Six Nations championship opener at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.

The 6ft 2in flanker’s girlfriend Camilla Kerslake welcomed him back from a hard day’s training with a roast chicken dinner, some slinky black lingerie and a very broad smile.

The opera singer accompanied her image with the caption: 'Welcomed my man home from camp like this tonight. Gotta feed him up for the first #6Nations test! #Rugby #Classical #roast #naughty #nighty #Dinner’

Then she posted the picture on Instagram and flagged it up by tweeting: ‘Welcomed my man home from camp like this tonight. Gotta feed him up for the first #6Nations test! #Rugby #Classical #roast #naughty #nighty #Dinner’

At least the 26-year-old soprano, born in London to a Welsh mother and New Zealander father, underlined the appropriate patriotism for such an occasion – by posing beside a Union Jack rug as she presented the feast to Robshaw, 28, her boyfriend of four years.

However, the glamorous singer made no mention of what she was intending to dish up for pudding.

Miss Kerslake’s cheeky curtain-raiser to this evening’s match provoked ribald responses from some of her friends and Twitter followers, one tweeting: ‘Blimey, Camilla, how can you expect the poor guy to concentrate on dinner when you’re dressed like that?! X’.

Another warned: ‘Make sure he does not get an injury tonight!’

The multi-faceted Camilla, who recently starred in a raunchy opera, has performed in front of the Queen, sung in a pop band, won a string of classical music accolades, regularly sings the National Anthem at Twickenham and has recently been doing voice-overs for an opera-singing sheep in a film of the popular children’s animation Shaun the Sheep.

She also finds time to be an accomplished cook. Her Facebook page includes a photograph of the beef wellington she prepared for a Kerslake and Robshaw family gathering – and it may be that roast chicken is a regular dish at home for the couple.

The couple have been together for four years and rumours have been swirling that they may be engaged

‘Feeding a rugby player will bankrupt me,’ she said recently. ‘When I cook meals at home, Chris will chow down four chicken breasts and a barrel of rice.’

Tonight’s match at the Millennium Stadium has added spice because the two sides have been drawn in the same pool for the Rugby World Cup which takes place this autumn.

Camilla is likely to be in the stands and her support could be very vocal.

She recently tweeted about Andy Murray’s girlfriend’s infamous outburst at the Australian Open: ‘As someone in a similar position to #KimSears (though I don’t condone her language) the heat of the moment can get to you.’

The couple have been together for four years and there has been speculation that they may soon get engaged, or already have. 

But rumours were kicked into touch recently when he was reported as saying: 'I don’t have time for anything other than rugby.’
