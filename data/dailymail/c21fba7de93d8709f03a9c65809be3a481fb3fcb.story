The family of a teenager crushed to death by a tree branch have been awarded an undisclosed pay-out.

Sophie Howard, 13, was killed instantly after sustaining fatal head injuries when she was hit by the 20ft long branch.

She was off school at time because of a teachers’ strike and was sat on a park bench under the 85-year-old Hybrid Black Poplar.

Heartbreak: Sophie Howard's parents said no amount of money would ever make up for the loss of their daughter

The branch fell due to a natural phenomenon called Sudden Limb Drop Syndrome (SLDS) which causes branch limbs to randomly explode.

The condition is caused by long periods of dry weather followed by a sudden down pour of rain.

Branches which have been dried out can explode when it rains and the tree soaks up a lot of water.

Sophie, who left a twin brother Elliott, died after she was hit by the branch on June 30, 2011.

Days after the tragedy a second branch fell from the same tree - which had not been roped off and where friends and family were laying flowers.

Experts who examined the tree in Yaxley, Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, said it was full of decay and should have been felled by the council before the tragedy.

An inspection carried out by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) a month after Sophie’s death found that eleven trees in the park were “high risk.”

An inquest into Sophie’s death in December 2011 heard the tree was at “significant risk” of loosing branches.

Yesterday Yaxley Parish Council agreed to pay an undisclosed out-of-court settlement to the family.

Lessons: An inquest heard that another branch had fallen from the same tree days after the tragedy as mourners were leaving flowers.

But Sophie’s parents Laura, a civil servant, and Martin, an account manager, said 'no amount of money' could make up for what happened.

In a statement they said: 'The last 16 months have been horrendous as we’ve struggled to come to terms with the fact Sophie is no longer with us.

'She was a beautiful girl with her whole life ahead of her but this has been taken from her and it is heartbreaking. Her loss to us is immeasurable, and our grief endless.

'At first it seemed a tragic case of fate or wrong time, wrong place, sadly after the coroner’s inquest it became apparent that this was not the case.

'We just hope councils across the country take note and learn from the mistakes that led to Sophie’s death.

'Nothing can bring her back, and no amount of money could ever make up for what happened, but we want to be sure no one else suffers such a huge loss as we have.'

Investigation: A Health and Safety Executive probe found 11 other trees in the park were of 'high risk' to the public

Tributes: Friends laid flowers and left emotional tributes at the tree where Sophie was killed in June last year

Sophie, an Year 8 pupil from Sawtry Community College, was spending the day at Middletons Road Recreation Ground after her school closed due to industrial action.

The HSE found Yaxley Parish Council was not ensuring the health and safety of the public as it could not prove it had an effective system for managing trees in the park.

Katrina Elsey, from lawyers Irwin Mitchell who represented the family, said: 'This is one of the most tragic cases I have ever worked on.

'We were determined to get answers for Sophie’s family to see if anything could have prevented her death and also ensure lessons are learnt by councils across the country to prevent a similar tragedy from happening again.'

A spokesman for Yaxley Parish Council yesterday refused to comment.
