Nasa is monitoring a piece of 'Russian' space junk that looks likely to come dangerously close to the International Space Station during a planned space walk tomorrow.

The debris is heading towards the station, where Atlantis yesterday docked on its final mission.

Scientists are still trying to work out how big the object is and how close it will come to Atlantis. Some believe it originated from a defunct Russian satellite that is orbiting Earth.

LeRoy Cain, mission management team leader, said he hopes the space junk will keep a safe distance and as they observe its trajectory throughout today, they will be able to work out how close it will come.

In danger? Atlantis docked at the International Space Station yesterday, just hours before Nasa scientists warned a piece of space junk is heading its way

A space walk is scheduled to take place on Tuesday afternoon, but this could now be threatened by the debris

If it appears that the space junk is 
getting too close for comfort, the astronauts will be able to use 
thrusters to move Atlantis out of its way.

Two
weeks ago, the crew of the ISS had to shelter in the lifeboats after a 
piece of debris missed them by just over 1,000ft - the closest call to 
date.

Since the first object, Sputnik One, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of perhaps tens of millions of items of debris.

The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel.

It is estimated that there are 370,000 pieces of space junk floating in Earth's orbit.

Yesterday Atlantis landed at the International Space Station for the last time, two days after it became the final Nasa shuttle to blast into space.

Writing the final chapter in a 30-year story of triumphs and tragedy, the last shuttle docked successfully after the astronauts on board spent most of their first full day in orbit checking the space shuttle for any damage from Friday's launch.

Atlantis will now proceed with its mission to deliver more than four tons of supplies - enough for a year - and spare parts to the ISS as well as clearing rubbish and picking up a broken pump to transport back to Earth for inspection.

As the shuttle made its final docking on the space station astronaut Ronald Garan Jr said: 'Atlantis arriving. Welcome to the International Space Station for the last time.'

Right before docking, the shuttle also performed a mandated 'back-flip' in space for the station crew to shoot images of the Thermal Protection System for more analysis.

The mission will also fly the Robotic Refuelling Mission (RRM), an experiment designed to demonstrate and test the tools, technologies and techniques needed to robotically refuel satellites in space - even satellites not designed to be serviced.

To check the shield yesterday, they used the shuttle's robot arm and an extension to slowly examine the most vulnerable parts of the shuttle's outer edges, a safety check that has become the norm since 2003, when the space shuttle Columbia was destroyed when it returned to Earth because of damage during lift off.

On Saturday, the astronauts were woken up at 3.59am by Coldplay's Viva la Vida - dedicated to pilot Doug Hurley - as well as a mass greeting from the many employees of Nasa's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville.

'Good morning, Atlantis,' the workers said in a message recorded before launch. 'The Marshall Space Flight Center hopes you enjoyed your ride to orbit. We wish you a successful mission and a safe return home.'
