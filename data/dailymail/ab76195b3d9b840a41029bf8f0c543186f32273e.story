The hit television show Glee could be banned in Britain after a Midlands comedy club won a High Court battle against the show's makers.

The Glee Club took legal action against Twentieth Century Fox accusing show bosses of stealing their name and won.

Mark Tughan, 45, registered the name for his chain of comedy clubs as a trademark in the UK in 1999 - ten years before the US musical show first aired in Britain on Sky One.

TV favourite: The long running TV show, which is due to resume its fifth series in this country on Sky One next month shows a group of high-school entertainers in a musical comedy drama

Glee: The television show could potentially be pulled off screen for infringing the Midlands nightclubs' trademark. The judge will decide what action to take at a future hearing

He argued that customers were being put off attending his venues in Birmingham, Nottingham, Oxford and Cardiff because people associated them with the teen musical drama.

Senior executives from Rupert Murdoch's Fox TV were flown in to contest the claims, saying they had no prior knowledge that the comedy clubs or their trademark existed

But following a two-and-a-half year case, High Court judges sitting in London today agreed with Mr Tughan and ruled in Mr Tughan's favour.

It means the popular US series could now be axed from UK screens after a judge ruled it 'diluted and tarnished' the reputation of Mr Tughan's chain of comedy clubs.

However, Fox has said that it intends to appeal against the ruling.

Deputy Judge Roger Wyand QC said Fox had infringed the Glee Club's registered trademark.

He said: 'I have found that there is a likelihood of confusion and Twentieth Century Fox's use causes dilution and tarnishing... the damage suffered by Comic Enterprises is caused by its venues being confused with the TV show and its potential customers being put off.'

Speaking after the case, Mr Tughan said: 'I had no desire to resort to such a David and Goliath legal action which could potentially result in depriving Glee fans in the UK of their favourite show.

'But the High Court has looked at the evidence and agreed that the programme makers have confused the public and damaged my business, brand and reputation for cutting edge comedy and music, over a period of more than four years so far.

'I tried to resolve this before it reached court, however Fox's refusal to get round the table with me leaves matters in the hands of the judge.'

The ruling means future episodes of the show and repeats could be scrapped.

It could also mean the show would need a full re-branding and Glee CD's, DVD's and music downloads could also be banned from sale in this country.

A judge today ruled that Twentieth Century Fox had 'infringed' a trade mark. But he said Comic Enterprises had not been damaged.

Deputy High Court Judge Roger Wyand QC 
made no mention of any compensation in a written ruling published 
following a High Court hearing in London.

He said any subsequent issues 
would be analysed at another hearing.

Judge Wyand said album 
compilations of songs performed on the show had been sold in the UK, two
 world concert tours had included performances in Manchester and London 
and Glee merchandise had been sold.

'Comic
 Enterprises says that all these activities, when carried out the United
 Kingdom, infringe the (trademark) and pass of Twentieth Century Fox's 
show and associated products as being associated in the course of trade 
with Comic Enterprises,' said Judge Wyand.

'Twentieth Century Fox denies infringement and passing off.'

The
 judge concluded that Comic Enterprises' claim on infringement 
succeeded. But he said the company's claim on 'passing off' failed.

'I believe that (the) evidence taken as a whole shows that there is a likelihood of confusion,' he said.

'Twentieth
 Century Fox's use causes dilution and tarnishing. Continued use of the 
sign in such circumstances cannot be in accordance with honest practices
 in industrial or commercial matters. Twentieth Century Fox has 
infringed the (trademark).'

But
 he added: 'I am not convinced that such confusion is sufficiently 
likely to be said to cause damage to Comic Enterprises. The passing off 
case fails.'

Judge Wyand 
gave no hint of what the consequences of his ruling might be. He said - 
when handing down the ruling at a hearing in London today - that 
subsequent issues would be considered at another hearing.

The long running TV show, which is due to resume its fifth series in this country on Sky One next month shows a group of high-school entertainers in a musical comedy drama.

Mr Tughan, who opened the first Glee Club branch in Birmingham in 1994, said previously: 'Glee's performers sing covers and the programme is aimed at a young demographic while mine starts at 18.

'It's manifested itself in the under-performance of newer outlets in Oxford and Nottingham.

'Members of staff said people were walking along the street and pointing to the entrance, asking if it was something to do with the TV show.'

A spokesman for 20th Century Fox Television said: 'We intend to appeal and are confident that, as the case plays out, we will ultimately prevail. We remain committed to delivering Glee to all of its fans in the UK.'
