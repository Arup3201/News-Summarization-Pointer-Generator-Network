The ex-girlfriend of paedophile Ian Watkins has claimed she contacted a chief constable about the singer's  obsession with child abuse but police 'couldn't be bothered' to investigate.

Joanna Mjadzelics, who was cleared of a string of child sex offences this week, said South Wales Police also 'refused' to take evidence that the Lostprophets star had a cache of child porn.

Later Ms Mjadzelics was herself accused of possessing indecent images of a child, sending vile pictures to the singer and demanding that he send her illegal pornography.

But following a trial at Cardiff Crown Court, a jury found the 39-year-old not guilty on all charges after she claimed she was trying to entrap her former lover and trick him into revealing his crimes.

Upsetting: Joanna Mjadzelics, who was cleared of a string of child sex offences this week, said that she went to the very top of South Wales Police about Ian Watkins but the force 'couldn't be bothered' to investigate

Allegations: Ms Mjadzelics claims she took illegal images sent to her by Watkins to police, including bringing her laptop into a police station, but 'they refused to take it', she said

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is currently investigating officers from three forces over claims they failed to act on reports made to them about Watkins.

The court heard that she reported Watkins to the authorities in 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012 to raise the alarm over his child sex crimes.

She told police he had sent her images of a 'very young girl being raped', but they refused to examine her phone or computer, the jury was told.

Today she said she had tried to contact South Wales' chief constable Peter Vaughan in 2011, which was passed on to other officers who she claims failed to properly investigate her claims.

Speaking about her ordeal on ITV's This Morning she said: 'I reported the images that he'd sent me, I went straight to the chief constable in 2011, and was in touch with a detective sergeant who I had previously dealt with.

'I kept asking how I was going to get these images to you, and then three more times after that I took my laptop into the police station and they refused to take it. And finally when one of the officers did see the images they swore blind it was over 16 - I was so confused, thinking 'no it isn't'. And told me to get on with my life.'

She added, 'It was literally like walking into a wall. And from the documentation I've now had disclosed to me from the CPS - there is actually a note from one detective sergeant and it says "although the images are alarming, we're reluctant to investigate because it would be high profile and would create a lot of press interest". 

Vigilante: The 39-year-old, pictured after she was cleared this week, insisted she was only trying to gather evidence about the crimes of Watkins, left

Watkins, 37, is currently serving a 35-year prison sentence for sex offences including the attempted rape of a fan's baby. Two women were jailed alongside him for assisting his crimes.

Ms Mjadzelics, from Doncaster, told the jury during her trial that she reported Watkins to the police, but they ignored her because she was a prostitute who was regarded as a 'nut job'.

She insisted that she only engaged in lurid sexual conversations with the shamed star in a bid to collect evidence which would bring Watkins to justice.

The prosecution had claimed that she was obsessed with the singer, and would do anything to fuel his desires, but the jury acquitted her.

She said: ''I don't feel anything at the moment because I'm still a bit numb from it all.'

Talking about rebuilding her life she said: 'I'm completely broke - they've destroyed me financially, emotionally and physically'.  

Despite having apparently been praised by the police for her actions, Ms Mjadzelics was arrested two years ago, and charged shortly after Watkins and his two accomplices pleaded guilty and were jailed in December 2013.

The Crown Prosecution Service defended the decision to pursue the case against Mjadzelics, while South Wales Police described the investigation as ‘extremely challenging and complex’.

The force today said it could not comment on her allegations because of the ongoing IPCC investigation.
