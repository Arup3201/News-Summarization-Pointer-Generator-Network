With the amount of booze flowing in Germany this week, it's surprising anyone noticed at all.

As the nation toasted its first World Cup final victory for 24 years, it emerged a gang of thieves had broken into a warehouse and stolen enough beer to fill 10 trucks.

The raiders prised open a small gate at the back of the building, in the western city of Krefeld, and stole 300,000 litres of beer - worth around £1.7million.

Now that's a hangover: A day after Germany toasted its first World Cup final victory for 24 years, a warehouse owner in Krefeld discovered thieves had broken in and stolen enough beer to fill 10 trucks (file photo)

It is believed no one had checked on the warehouse's contents for almost four days.

The theft was only noticed on Monday, as workers across Germany nursed hangovers from Sunday night's historic win.

Police said the brazen raid could have happened at any time between 5pm on Thursday last week and noon on Monday.

The beer was arranged in several pallets on the warehouse floor, said officers, which was in an industrial area on the outskirts of the city.

The thieves tried a back door to the warehouse but could not get in, so went in through the front door instead and reached the beer through an office block.

Witnesses saw 
tractors loaded with trailers on the premises which later disappeared, but many did not assume the sight was suspicious.

The tractors then came back to the warehouse at regular intervals to reload before vanishing, police said.

A spokesman said: 'From there, the offender transported diverse beer pallets in an amount of about 10 trucks.

'Other witnesses claimed to have seen those trucks on the A40 in the direction of Duisburg.

'It is believed that the trucks were unloaded in Duisburg and then drove back to the [warehouse].'

With prices at around €3.50 (£2.77) for half a litre, the beer would have been worth around €2.1million (£1.66m).

Police have not revealed what brand or brands of beer were stolen.

They are, however, looking for more witnesses, or anyone who can provide information about where the beer might be stored.

The spokesman said: 'Has anyone seen a large quantity of beer?'
