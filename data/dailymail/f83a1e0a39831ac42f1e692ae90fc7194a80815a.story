A 19-year-old unlicensed driver who killed two charity cyclists 'only looked away from the road for a couple of seconds', a New Hampshire court heard yesterday.

Darriean Hess was charged with negiligent homicide and second-degree assault after plowing into four bike riders on a Seabrook bridge.

Her court appearance came on the day police arrested a second woman who has been accused of providing drugs to Hess and allowing her to drive without a license.

Charged: Darriean Hess, pictured in September, who is accused of killing two bicyclists while high on a cocktail of drugs and alcohol told witnesses her dead mother was coming to get her after the tragic crash

Cindy Sheppard allegedly supplied narcotics to Hess at about 1.30am on Saturday and, at 8am that day let her drive a car even though she knew the teenager did not have a license.

The 48-year-old is being held on $10,000 bail and is due to be arraigned on Thursday, according to Boston.com.

Police have not said what drug Sheppard allegedly gave Hess, but she was described as 'a significant source of heroin,' Seacoast Online reported.

Sheppard had been arrested on charges of selling heroin and cocaine in June and was also said to be the person who picked Hess up after police pulled her over hours before the crash.

Under New Hampshire law, no plea was entered on Hess's behalf, but the court heard from a retired police major, who said he saw her driving so fast over the bridge he thought she was being chased.

As she went over the bridge she hit four cyclists, killing Pamela Wells and Elise Bouchard, and injuring Margo Heigh and Uwe Uhmeyer.

She continued to drive a short distance, coming to a stop after crashing into the Welcome to Seabrook sign.

The 19-year-old, who is engaged, had been stopped by police near the spot of the accident only a few hours before for driving without a license.

After the crash, retired police major David Kelley claimed Hess told him she only took her eyes off the road for a few seconds.

She is being held on $50,000 bail after the court ruled she could be a flight risk as she has family in Alaska.

Gordon Wiley, who was friends 
with Ms Bouchard, said after the hearing he was pleased she was being held on a high bond.

'She didn't have any conscience when she got back in the car [after being stopped earlier] and I didn't see any tears rolling out of her eyes when she was sitting there,' he told Seacoast Online.

Concern: Hess's fiance Scott Martin and sister Cassandra Clifton don't know if they can afford the bail

He added that his wife was a close friend of Ms Bouchard, and often cycled with her but had ducked out of doing the Granite State Wheelmen Tri-State Seacoast Century because she was new to the sport.

Hess's family and lawyer said the 19-year-old was 'traumatized' by the accident and her sister said they didn't think they would be able to afford the bail.

Her sister. Cassandra Clifton, said: 'Everybody's devastated.' adding that Hess 'just wants to be close to her family'.

Hess has been accused of driving too fast for the road conditions and number of cyclists, when she crossed over a center line and hit the riders on a bridge, district attorney Jim Reams said.

Her victims had been taking part in the 40th annual Granite State Wheelmen Tri-State Seacoast Century ride.

The 19-year-old had been stopped on the same road eight hours before the crash and ticketed for driving without a license.

Hampton Police Chief James Sullivan said
 the officer in that stop followed policy when he issued her an 
appearance ticket then allowed a friend to pick her up and drive the car
 away.

'It's unfortunate that the incident happened the next day but the officer had no way of knowing that,' Mr Sullivan said.

Mr
 Reams would not say if the young woman's license had been suspended and
 said only that she did not currently have a New Hampshire driver's 
license.

One of the women who died, 60-year-old Mrs Wells, was described as a devoted mother to her two children aged 16 and 17, the Boston Herald reported.

In
 a Facebook statement Tom Rogers, her husband of 19 years, called her 
the love of his life and said: 'Pam was the best thing that ever 
happened to me.

First time: Wells, pictured, was planning to ride 100 miles for the first time and had been working up toward it all summer

She had been taking part in annual two-day cycling event, that takes in roads in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.

On Saturday, about 1,500 bicyclists were taking part in the event, but it was the first time Mrs Wells had joined in.

She was planning to ride 100 miles for the first time and had been working up toward it all summer with Ms Bouchard, Mr Rogers said.

Driver: Hess was taken to Portsmouth Regional Hospital for treatment of minor injuries

'Thoughtless': Hess, pictured, had been stopped by police a day before the crash for having no license

Andy Wallenstein, chairman of 
publicity for the Granite State Wheelmen, which organizes the annual 
event, said the crash was the first major accident for the 40-year-old 
event.

'A few skinned knees or something like that, but I don’t believe there’s ever been anything like this,' he told the Boston Globe.

'Anybody that gets injured bicycling, I think, affects the whole group, because it just makes us aware of how vulnerable we are out on the road.'
