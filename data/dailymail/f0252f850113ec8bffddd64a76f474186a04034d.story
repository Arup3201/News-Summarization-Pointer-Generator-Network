An incredibly rare Sierra Nevada red fox has been spotted has inside Yosemite National Park for the first time in a century.

Park officials confirmed the sighting in California of one of the rarest mammals in North America, with only 50 in existence. It was captured on one of the park's hi-tech motion sensor cameras.

The Sierra Nevada red fox is a solitary creature and rarely travels in groups. It's also a nocturnal animal, meaning that sighting of the fox are incredibly rare.

Superintendent of Yosemite National Park Don Neubacher said: 'We are thrilled to hear about the sighting of the Sierra Nevada red fox, one of the most rare and elusive animals in the Sierra Nevada.

'National parks like Yosemite provide habitat for all wildlife and it is encouraging to see that the red fox was sighted in the park.'

Sarah Stock, a wildlife biologist at the park added: 'Confirmation of the Sierra Nevada red fox in Yosemite National Park’s vast alpine wilderness provides an opportunity to join research partners in helping to protect this imperiled animal.

'We’re excited to work across our boundary to join efforts with other researchers that will ultimately give these foxes the best chances for recovery.'

In 2010, a red fox was also spotted to the north of Yosemite National Park, where it is believed there is a small fox population 

There were two documented sightings of the animals in early December at Sonara Pass, which lies to the north of the park. Biologists believe there is a small fox population in that area. 

Prior to that, the last verified sighting of the animal was over 20 years ago. It is almost 100 years since one was seen in Yosemite.

Park officials say they will continue to try and track the Sierra Nevada red fox using remote cameras in the hope that they will find more animals.

At each camera station, the crew also set up hair snare stations in the hopes of obtaining hair samples for genetic analysis.

Through genetic analysis, park workers can learn more about the diversity within the population and to confirm whether the animal detected in Yosemite is genetically related to those in the Sonora Pass area
