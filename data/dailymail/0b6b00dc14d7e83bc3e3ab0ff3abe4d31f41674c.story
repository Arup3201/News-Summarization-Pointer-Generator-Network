Ukip has become 'quite seductive' to voters fed up with the coalition, David Cameron has admitted.

The Prime Minister said families who have seen their living standards squeezed while immigration rises have faced a 'tough time' and are attracted to Nigel Farage's party.

His comments strike a markedly different tone to previous Tory attacks on Ukip, in the wake of Douglas Carswell becoming the party's first elected MP.

But after warning voters they could 'got to bed with Farage and wake-up with Miliband', Mr Cameron also ridiculed the Ukip leader with a mock newspaper front page with his two opponents under the sheets together.

The Conservatives have swung between attacking Ukip and trying to woo their supporters.

During the Tory party conference, Boris Johnson accused defectors of being the kind of people who had sex with vacuum cleaners - while former Chancellor Ken Clarke said the party's supporters were 'grumpy old men' who had led 'disappointing lives'.

Mr Cameron attacked Tory defector Mark Reckless for betraying the hard work of ordinary Conservative activists which had got his 'fat arse' into the Commons.

But speaking last night, Mr Cameron admitted the combination of growing Eurosceptcism, high immigration and low wage were fuelling Ukip's appeal.

One poll at the weekend put Ukip on 25 per cent, which in theory would give them 128 MPs at the next election.

Mr Camron told ITV's The Agenda: 'We've had a very tough time in Britain. People haven't seen pay rises or living standard rises, often for year after year, you've got Europe looking like the source of our problems rather than the source of opportunity, immigration has been too high, there's been a coalition which not everyone has liked.

'And that's given the seductiveness of the simple answer that Mr Farage suggests. I think it's become quite seductive.'

Ukip leader Nigel Farage yesterday celebrated in Westminster after Douglas Carswell took his seat in the Commons, but Mr Cameron warned a vote for Ukip would help boost Labour

As Prime Minister, you might think he has better things to do.

But David Cameron has revealed he will always make time for a selfie, because he does not want to disappoint a potential supporter. 

During the Tory party conference, Mr Cameron was repeatedly stopped by people wanting to have their picture taken with him.

Mother-of-two Parveen Hassan from Birmingham revealed that the PM was always happy to pose for a picture. 'He's one of these types of people, if you stop him, he doesn't say no,' she said.

Mr Cameron told ITV that he had seen the report, and could refuse smiling the for cameras. 

'I read this thing that 'he never says no to a selfie'. 

'It's quite rude if someone asks you for a selfie and, you know, we politicians are in the business of trying to win people over, to say 'no you can't have one'.'

Ukip has been boosted by the election of Mr Carswell, who triggered a by-election in his Clacton seat after defecting from the Tories to Ukip in August.

He took his seat in the Commons yesterday, with Mr Farage watching from the public gallery.

The Tories are planning to 'throw the kitchen sink' at the by-election next month in Rochester and Strood, caused by Mr Reckless' defection.

Today it was announced the by-election will be held on November 20. 

At the 2010 general election, Mr Reckless won the Kent seat as a Conservative with a majority of 9,953 over Labour. Ukip did not field a candidate.

Mr Cameron announced that the Tory candidate would be one of two local women - to be chosen by a postal 'primary' of local voters.

In a letter to residents, the Conservative leader said Ukip wanted to 'turn this election into a national media circus'.

'We want it to be about you and what you want for the future of this area. The decision is in your hands. There's no stunts or backroom deals, just a strong local candidate you can trust.'

The candidates up for selection - in a poll open to voters regardless of which party they support - are local councillors Kelly Tolhurst and Anna Firth.

In his letter, Mr Cameron said Ms Tolhurst, who runs a marine survey business, 'has seen the strain that excessive immigration has put on housing and our local services' and would push for action to get it 'under control'.

Fears over the scale of immigration are a significant factor in the surge in popularity that saw Ukip win May's European elections and then secure its first MP and come within a whisker of snatching a safe Labour Commons seat in Greater Manchester.

Ms Firth, a former barrister, would 'fight for more police on our streets to tackle anti-social behaviour, better health services and a better deal for our armed forces, to whom we own so much', Mr Cameron said.

Both candidates would take part in public hustings around the constituency before the selection vote, he said.

'We're putting the people of Rochester and Strood in the drivers seat. No stunts: just a strong local candidate you can trust.'  

However, the by-election is likely to be held days after the Commons votes on signing up to EU rules on policing, including the European Arrest Warrant.

It is claimed up to 40 Tory MPs could rebel on the plan, fearing it plays into the hands of Ukip.

Mr Cameron wants to pitch the next election as a direct choice between him and Labour leader Ed Miliband.

Polls suggest barely one in five people think Mr Miliband is up to the job of being Prime Minister.

Mr Cameron told ITV: 'I think the question at the next election is a big one, and I think there is quite a big choice.

'The difference between what Ed Miliband wants and what I want is quite profound, and I think we'll see a big turnout at the next election.'

Tory defector Mark Reckless is hoping to win his Rochester and Strood seat for Ukip in the by-election which will take place on November 20

In his speech to the Tory party conference, Mr Cameron warned that a vote for Ukip made it more likely that Labour would win the general election.

He said: 'Here's a thought: on 7th May you could go to bed with Nigel Farage, and wake up with Ed Miliband. I don't know about you but not one bit of that works for me.'

He returned to the theme last night, with the mock newspaper front page with an image of Mr Farage and Mr Miliband in bed.

The headline 'Shock: Lastest #WakeUpCall selfie revealed' follows the  campaign by Unicef where celebrities have posted pictures online of themselves first thing in the morning, as a Wake Up Call to the humanitarian crisis in Syria.

Mr Cameron joked: : 'We've had the wake-up selfies with pictures of people that have just woken up - very brave. 

'And I told you that if you go to bed with Nigel then you could wake up with Ed Miliband and so I've got the wake up selfie.'

Meanwhile plans for TV debates ahead of next year's General Election are in chaos, with growing doubts over whether they will take place. 

Broadcasters announced Mr Farage would be given a place in one of three debates, but Ukip suggested he should be included in more than one and the Greens, the SNP and Respect each demanded a place. 

Mr Cameron said he wanted the proposed TV debates to happen, but raised doubts about the detail of the plans.

'I wouldn't have them all in the campaign, they took all the life out of the rest of the campaign, they were the only thing that people were judged on. 

'And the second thing is I think you can't have one new party without having another new party. And the Greens have got an MP, Ukip have now got an MP, I don't see how you can have one without the other.'
