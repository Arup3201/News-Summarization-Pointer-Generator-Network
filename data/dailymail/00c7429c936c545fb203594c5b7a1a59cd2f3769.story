Derek Llambias has opened up the possibility of Kenny McDowall remaining in charge of Rangers beyond the end of the season.

The new Ibrox chief executive addressed the managerial situation at Monday’s tempestuous Annual General Meeting.

Ally McCoist was placed on gardening leave on Sunday evening, nine days after notifying the club hierarchy of his intent to step down at the end of a 12-month notice period.

Assistant McDowall was then named as interim manager for the current campaign, with coaching support provided by Ian Durrant and Gordon Durie as Rangers seek to close the gap on runaway Championship leaders Hearts.

And while the bleak financial situation continues to cloud the future at Ibrox, Llambias had words of backing for McDowall.

‘When Ally handed in his notice, it was a surprise to us,’ said Llambias. ‘He felt he had done his time and needed to move on. He was willing to work his notice.

‘We needed time to reflect on that decision and do what was best for the club. We said we’d come back to Ally and it was business as usual because we had a game at the weekend.

‘We spoke to Ally last night and decided it was better that we took this opportunity to put Ally on gardening leave. It would give him time to reflect and spend time at home and for us to reorganise the coaching staff.

‘We all have to move forward. Ally has been a great ambassador for the club, he has done a great job for the club and brought through some good youth players. But it is Ally’s choice to leave, not ours.

‘When somebody makes a choice to leave in that position in football, we all have to move on. We have to respect what Ally has done and respect what the club is trying to do now.

‘We are going to give Kenny 100 per cent support. He is going to be in place until the end of the season - and maybe beyond.’

Llambias had earlier used his opening address at the meeting to outline why he believes his previous five-year stint running Newcastle United makes him the right man to drag Rangers out of their current plight.

Initially appointed as a non-executive director in the wake of the board accepting a £2million loan from Mike Ashley in late October, Llambias was elevated to the post of chief executive last Friday.

‘I am honoured to have been appointed as the new chief executive of Rangers,’ he said. ‘As you can imagine, it has been a very up and down experience over the past few days – to say the least.

‘But I am now going to be in a position to roll up my sleeves and get on with the hard work it will take to get this club back onto its own two feet.

‘I have a strong track record in business and football. I spent the early part of my career in leisure before being appointed as managing director of Newcastle United.

‘When I began there in 2008 the club, quite frankly, was in a really poor state. It wasn’t easy, but with hard work they turned things round. By the time I stepped down in 2013, Newcastle United was in a financially secure position, standing on its own two feet, and it continues to remain so.

‘As I begin my new period of office at Rangers Football Club, I am fully aware that this club has a great tradition and proud history. The responsibility resting on my shoulders is something I do not take lightly.

‘I know that the relationship between the board and some shareholders and fans has become strained. I understand those frustrations but that was then and this is now.

‘The task ahead will not be easy. There will be times ahead when we will have to take and make difficult decisions. Not everything I do will be popular. But I can guarantee that everything I do will be in the best interests of Rangers Football Club to secure its long-term financial stability. I only ask for your patience and an open mind.

‘This is a journey we will have to take together. The recipe for the future is simple. We need financial stability off the pitch and great football on the pitch.

‘Our goal is to get Rangers back to the Premier League and to be in Europe. That is all I can offer you now. Hopefully next year we’ll have a much better speech.’
