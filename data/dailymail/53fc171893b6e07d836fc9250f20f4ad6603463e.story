Three people have been involved in a boat capsize in Sydney's Botany Bay on Sunday afternoon, killing two men and injuring a third. 

About 1.10pm (Sunday 14 December 2014), officers attached to Miranda Local Area Command and Marine Area Command were called to waters close to Botany Bay, near Salander Point, following reports of three men in the water. 

The three men were fishing in a small boat when their small boat hit rocks, causing the  men to fall into the water.

Two men have died and one other has suffered injuries after their boat capsized in Botany Bay

One man was winched by the Westpac Life Saver helicopter, suffering minor injuries.

The bodies of the two other men were located and winched into the helicopter. CPR was performed on both men but they were pronounced dead at the scene. 

Police have received no further reports of injuries.

Commander of the NSW Marine Area Command, Detective Superintendent Mark Hutchings, has reminded all boat users to ensure boat safety practices are adhered to at all times, as NSW waters get busy during the warmer months. 

'Keeping vigilant and ensuring safety when heading out on the water is often overlooked,' Detective Superintendent Hutchings said. 

'As the weather has been very unpredictable over the last few months, all boat users must stay alert to weather conditions and are urged to monitor the Bureau of Meteorology.'

'Police will continue to be out on the water checking all skippers adhere to the speed limits, respect fellow water users, and don’t operate vessels under the influence of drugs or alcohol; just as would be expected out on the roads,' he said.

A report will be prepared for the information of the Coroner.

No further information is available at this time.

Police have reminded water users to ensure all those on board adhere to the life jacket rules and regulations, and to check the water craft thoroughly in all respects before heading out on the water. 

Further tips include notifying others so that a responsible person knows the description of the boat and the expected time of the boat's return.

Be alert to possible riskier situations while boating, including at night, boating alone, crossing bars, and high risk of capsize or swamping, and avoid drinking and taking drugs when on-board.
