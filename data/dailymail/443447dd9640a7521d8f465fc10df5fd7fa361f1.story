Jose Mourinho expressed outrage at Ashley Barnes' tackle on midfielder Nemanja Matic, calling the studs-up challenge during Chelsea's draw with Burnley potentially career-ending and 'criminal'.

Burnley's Barnes escaped a red card from referee Martin Atkinson during the 1-1 draw after catching Matic on the left shin with his studs before Matic was sent off for his angry reaction. 

Mourinho, speaking on Goals on Sunday at his own request, said Barnes should have been sent off for the tackle and another one on Branislav Ivanovic and that a ban of six weeks would be fair.

 'What happened yesterday was similar to what happened with [Eden] Hazard at Stoke,' said Mourinho. This one yesterday is even worse because this can be end of career. This is end of career. I have to say this is end of career. Matic is a very lucky guy. This is end of career.'

The Portuguese claimed his players, especially volatile striker Diego Costa, are unfairly treated by officials during a 27-minute rant on the highlights show and defended Matic's reaction to the tackle in which he pushed Barnes to the ground. 

'I cannot find the words to describe what that player did. I can clearly understand football is about emotions and sometimes you lose the emotions. Clearly Matic had a reason to lose his emotions,' he said. 

'What could be the consequence of Matic's push? For the other player, nothing. One second later, he stands and goes. The consequence for Matic could be end of career.'

He said the tackle was 'criminal', referencing Sky Sports' labelling of offences by Costa as 'crimes'.

'When you say Diego crimes you cannot say a harsh tackle [for Barnes]. You have to say a criminal tackle,' Mourinho raged. 'You say Diego crimes because of a situation he put his boot on a hand. When this is Diego crimes, the minimum you have to say is [Barnes' tackle was a] criminal tackle.'

Mourinho then speculated as to what punishment, if any, awaits Barnes.  

'When Diego Costa had three matches banned, tell me how many this player [Barnes] deserves? Probably three matches to Matic. How many matches you think this player deserves? Mr Atkinson did not see anything. This is about footage, and analyse. I ask if Matic is going to get a three-match ban, if Diego got three matches, how many matches this player gets? I'm asking you. I'm asking the people at home.

'Yesterday I asked a couple of friends that were having dinner with me and my family at my house. You know what they were saying? Minimum three for the first one [on Ivanovic] and three for the second one [on Matic].'
