Jamie Carragher has blasted Mario Balotelli's contribution to Liverpool so far this season - stating that 'if there's one word' he wouldn't used to sum up the Italian striker it would be 'sacrifice'.

The Sportsmail columnist and Sky Sports pundit criticised the £16million summer signing ahead of Liverpool's clash with Basle in Switzerland.

When asked about Balotelli's performances for Liverpool this season, Carragher said: 'I think we need to see a lot more. I can't hide the way I feel about him.

'When he was at (Manchester) City I wasn't a fan. He's got one goal (so far this campaign).

'He's away in Europe tonight (against Basle) and playing as a lone striker. You have got to sacrifice yourself for the team tonight - play for the team and work hard.

'If there's one word that I'd never use to sum Balotelli up is sacrifice.'

Carragher was then asked if the 24-year-old forward was he difficult to play against, to which he replied: 'No. I've never seen it with him.

'I hope I'm wrong because I want him to do well.'

Balotelli's only goal for Liverpool since his move from AC Milan came in the Anfield side's first Champions League match of the seasn against Ludogorets.
