A 29-year-old teacher in Pennsylvania was arrested yesterday on suspicion of raping a student at school.

Shop teacher Todd McCullough was led out of Saltsburg High School in handcuffs yesterday morning after a student told administrators that he had made inappropriate advances.

That report led investigators to discover a more serious incident in which a student claims McCullough raped her.

Shop teacher arrested: 29-year-old shop teacher Todd McCullough was arrested yesterday morning at Saltsburg High School, where he allegedly raped a student last spring

Scene of the crime: According to the criminal complaint against McCullough, the rape happened in a Saltsburg High School classroom

The 16-year-old victim says McCullough sexually harassed her on several occasions last spring, culminating in the rape.

At first, it started with touching and compliments. According to the criminal complaint, McCullough 'physically touched the (16-year-old) victim's hips from behind with both hands, massaged the victim's shoulders and complimented her on her appearance'.

On another occasion, McCullough 'told the victim that she was looking "hot" and that his girlfriend was going to be away this weekend'.

At one point he lured her into a small isolated back room off the shop area and exposed himself to her. The school bell rang and she fled the room, avoiding class for a week. Days later he apologized but that didn't stop him from continuing to her harass her.

Unrelenting: McCullough's 16-year-old victim says he made several unwelcome advances on her and even apologized for his behavior before eventually raping her in a classroom's back room last spring

After apologizing, he asked her on several occasions to show him her breasts - which she refused.

Then he asked her to stay after class and again led her into the back room. This time he raped her.

After that, she says he attempted to keep her quiet by threatening her reputation.

'I hope you are mature about this, it's not only my (expletive) on the line, it's your (expletive) too,' he said.

The victim kept the rape to herself for  a while before confiding in a friend who urged her to tell school officials.

In response to McCullough's arrest, the school has issued a statement saying that the safety and welfare of students is 'of the utmost importance'.

'Every effort has been and will continue to be made to protect our students and staff from any conduct that would affect their health, safety, and welfare,' the statement read.

McCullough was arrested on charges of rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, sexual assault, institutional assault, corruption of minors, indecent exposure, harassment, disorderly conduct, open lewdness and two counts each of aggravated indecent assault and indecent assault.

Behind bars: McCullough is currently being held at the Indiana County Jail on $150,000 bond

He is being held at the Indiana County Jail on $150,000 bond. A preliminary hearing is set for November 13.

The Pennsylvania State Police are continuing their investigation of McCullough and believe that more victims may come forward.

'It's absolutely possible there may be other victims, so we are looking at everything at this point,' state Trooper John Matchik told CBS Pittsburgh.
