When the USS Williamsburg was commandeered by Harry Truman to be the President's personal yacht, she became one of the world's most famous ships.

Dignitaries such as Winston Churchill were invited to conferences on board, while the vessel sailed around the world taking Truman on a series of exotic vacations.

But now the celebrated boat is rusting away in an Italian shipyard - and could be scrapped within a few years if a last-minute attempt to save her fails.

Wreck: USS Williamsburg, once the U.S. President's official ship, is now rusting away in an Italian shipyard

Demise: The famous ship is neglected and unused in La Spezia, and is likely to sink within a few years if it is no rescued

Scheme: A campaigner has launched a new plan to save the ship and return her to the U.S., but it may be almost too late

The story of the Williamsburg began in 1930, when she was built as a private vessel in Bath, Maine and named 'Aras'.

In 1941, she was bought by the U.S. Navy and given the name that would make her famous - just in time to take part in the Second World War.

Williamsburg spent much of the war in Iceland, helping safeguard the delivery of supplies from the U.S. to Europe, and also underwent patrols of the North American coast.

Soon after the end of the war, she took over from Potomac as the President's official yacht - much to the delight of Harry Truman, who became President following the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1945.

The ship quickly gained a reputation as the 'seagoing White House', an iconic symbol of American strength and optimism as the U.S. took the lead in rebuilding the shattered West.

Truman used Williamsburg to entertain a string of dignitaries - both American officials such as Secretary of State George Marshall, and visiting foreign leaders.

Winston Churchill was a guest on the yacht, as was Clement Attlee, his successor as Britain's Prime Minister.

The President and Churchill would enjoy long nights of drinking and gambling, in which they would discuss such seminal issues at the Marshall Plan, Nato and the creation of the state of Israel.

Truman also took his vacations on board Williamsburg, cruising around the U.S. coast and travelling out to distant destinations such as Cuba and Bermuda.

When Dwight Eisenhower became President in 1953, he was less enamoured of the ship, and ordered her to be decommissioned after just one voyage.

In 1962, the yacht was given to the National Science Foundation to be used for oceanographic research, and renamed Anton Bruun after an eminent biologist.

Six years later, the famous ship was damaged when she was attached to a floating drydock which suddenly sank.

Many grand plans were suggested for the former Williamsburg, including converting her into a cruise ship, but none of them ever came to fruition.

Origins: The Williamsburg in 1946, soon after it stopped being a patrol boat and was handed over the White House

For 20 years, Truman's beloved yacht has been in Italy, slowly degrading and barely able to float.

The Williamsburg is currently moored at La Spezia, where her owners say she is likely to sink in the next few years and will then be cut up for scrap.

However, a retired seaman named Gianfranco Oddone is now campaigning to rescue the ship from her fate, and is seeking a buyer to restore the Williamsburg to its former glory.

Having once been an exchange student in Truman's home town of Lamar, Missouri, he is passionate about returning the presidential yacht to the U.S.
