A nurse who admitted killing at least 40 patients in his care but is suspected of murdering hundreds apologized for the deaths in his first ever interview from jail but still claimed they were mercy killings.

Charles Cullen was handed down six life sentences in 2006 after he admitted poisoning at least 40 people in New Jersey and Pennsylvania over the course of his 16-year nursing career.

Considered one of the most prolific serial killers in American history and once dubbed 'the angel of death', Cullen said he wanted to end his patients' suffering, even though many of them were in good health.

First claim: In an interview to be with CBS' 60 Minutes, Charles Cullen at first says he thought he was helping people by ending their suffering

Another tune: Cullen tells a different story when reminded some victims were not close to death. He says there was 'no justification' and 'I felt overwhelmed at the time'

Youngest and oldest victims: Michael T. Strenko, 21,  was having routine spleen surgery when he was poisoned and Helen Dean, 91, was in the hospital for breast cancer surgery when she died

The serial killer was interviewed for the first time ever about the murders by CBS' 60 Minutes, which was aired last night.

Caught: It wasn't until the suspicious death of Fr Florian J. Gall that Cullen's killing spree was finally unearthed

When asked if he considered himself a murderer, he said: 'I think that I had a lot of trouble accepting that word for a long time. I accept that that's what it is.'

When asked if he got pleasure out of 
killing people, Cullen told 60 Minutes: 'No, I thought that people 
weren't suffering anymore. So, in a sense, I thought I was helping.'

When it was pointed out that many of 
his patients weren't in pain, he said: 'You know, again, you know, I 
mean, my goal here isn't to justify.

'You know what I did there is no 
justification. I just think that the only thing I can say is that I felt
 overwhelmed at the time.'

In the interview broadcast last night on CBS' 60 Minutes, Cullen admits that if he had not been stopped, he probably would have went on to kill more people.

At the time of his arrest in December 2003, Cullen told authorities he had administered overdoses to patients to spare them from going into cardiac or respiratory arrest.

Even though there were suspicions at several of the hospitals he worked at, these were never reported or marked on his record and Cullen was able to continue his killing spree at each place he was transferred to.

Guilty: Charles Cullen is walked through the Northampton County Court House in Easton PA after he pleaded guilty to the 1998 murder of Easton Hospital patient, Ottomar Schramm

More murders: Cullen pleaded guilty in May 2004 to three additional murders of patients in a hospital where he worked

When Cullen was hired at Saint Luke's
 University Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, he had already been 
fired or forced to resign from five other hospitals.

Yet none of this was in his file with the state nursing board.

He admits to killing five people at 
St Lukes and even though there were suspicions, the hospital asked him 
to resign on the premise they would give him neutral references.

He was then hired as a critical care 
nurse at New Jersey's Somerset Medical Center, where he administered 
lethal injections to 13 patients over 13 months.

It was only when a Roman Catholic 
priest named Florian Gall died unexpectedly overnight while recovering 
from pneumonia, that the hospital discovered high levels of the heart 
drug digoxin in his blood.

It was the second unexplained overdose in two weeks and set in motion the events leading up to Cullen's arrest.

Asked why he thought he was able to 
go undetected for so long, he said: 'I think because it's a matter of 
worrying about lawsuits.

'If they pointed out that there was a
 problem they were going to be found liable for millions of dollars. 
They just saw it as a lot easier to not put themselves in a position of 
getting sued.'

He also revealed that when he was at 
Somerset, he was allowed to work one more shift even though he was being
 fired over the suspicious deaths.

'The weird thing about Somerset 
Hospital was is that they were planning on firing me the night before. 
So they let me work one more shift knowing that they were going to fire 
me the next day,' he told 60 Minutes.

'So they let me work an additional 
shift with the suspicion that I had harmed patients. Which I, you know, 
was kind of a bizarre thing to do.'

Cullen has admitted to killing 40 terminally ill patients in nine hospitals and a nursing home
