Spurned by the Denver Broncos after its high-profile signing of Peyton Manning this week, Tim Tebow is heading to New York.

The deal to bring the quarterback to the New York Jets was confirmed on Wednesday evening despite contractual issues which placed the move in threat at the last minute.

Hours after the Jets announced they had agreed in principle to take Tebow off the Broncos' hands for fourth- and sixth-round draft picks, the deal reportedly hit a snag.

ESPN football insider Adam Schefter reported that provisions in Tebow's contract caused complications in the completion of the trade, saying that the document has $5million worth of 'recapture language,' which meant the Jets would have to pay back some money to the Broncos.

The move to bring Tebow to New York had many fans and gridiron 
pundits shaking their heads, especially since the team gave its starting 
quarterback Mark Sanchez a three-year, $40.5million contract extension 
earlier this month.

With the NFL's salary cap, Tebow's base salaries for the next few seasons were attractive: $1.942 million in 2012, $2.266 million in 2013 and $2.590 million in 2014.

The question of Sanchez taking a back seat are yet to be answered, but Tebow would be facing the hounding New York media and the volatile Jets locker room, led by its vocally-impulsive coach Rex Ryan.

Several teams, including his hometown Jacksonville Jaguars, were among the possible suitors for Tebow.

While some have made the argument that the Jets and Tebow are a good fit, not everyone is putting the welcome mat outside MetLife Stadium.

During speculation last night that the Jets were going to make a run on the quarterback, the team’s outspoken cornerback Antonio Cromartie let out a groan on one of the world’s largest soapboxes - Twitter.

Last night, one of several anti-Tebow tweets said:  ‘We don't need Tebow. We sell out every home game let him go to Jacksonville Tampa or Miami. Our wildcat offense can b ran by J. Kerley or Joe McKnight we straight

He later added: ‘I don't know y (sic). We have @Mark_Sanchez and jus (sic) signed Drew [Stanton]. Mark has taken us to 2 AFC championship game. We need to build on the team we have now’.

Today, after the deal was done, he continued his critique of the Jets front office for making the trade.

'Y (sic) bring Tebow in when we need to bring in more Weapons for @Mark_Sanchez let's build the team around him. We already signed to 3 year ext'.

Defensive end Muhammad Wilkerson also took to the social networking site to weigh in, telling his Tebow-minded followers: ‘We had a bad yr but we ain't that bad'.

Others welcomed the faith-minded quarterback, including New Jersey Gov Chris Christie and the office of New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Tebow, who led the Broncos to the first round of the playoffs last season (including a win over the Jets), became expendable when the Broncos signed Manning to a five-year, $96million deal this week.

The Jets were briefly a part of the cavalcade of NFL teams that pursued Manning.

Tebow is expected to add a versatile dimension to the Jets' offense, including running the team's wildcat formation - something new offensive coordinator Tony Sparano enjoys using.

He also provides a solid presence in a locker room that was strife with infighting last season - particularly a very public squabbled between Sanchez and wide receiver Santonio Holmes.

Now, fans may wonder: Can the Big Apple survive Tebowmania AND Linsanity in the same sports market?
