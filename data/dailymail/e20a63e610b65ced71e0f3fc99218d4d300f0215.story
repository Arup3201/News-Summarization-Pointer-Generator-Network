Julia Roberts' half-sister Nancy Motes died on Sunday in Los Angeles.

On Monday, her family confirmed to People the 37-year-old had passed away in what appears to be an overdose.

'It is with deep sadness that the family of Nancy Motes ... confirms that she was found dead in Los Angeles yesterday of an apparent drug overdose,' the statement read. 'There is no official report from the Coroner's office yet. The family is both shocked and devastated.'

She was discovered in the bathroom of her home by her fiancé John 
Dilbeck and pronounced dead at 2:12 p.m., a spokesman for the Los Angeles Coroner's Office told MailOnline.

She is currently undergoing an autopsy to determine cause of death. Toxicology results will likely take 6-8 weeks to get back.

Julia's rep did not return calls to MailOnline.

Nancy was an aspiring actress who had worked as a production assistant on TV's Glee.

Julia and Nancy had the same mother, Betty Lou, but different fathers: Nancy's dad was Michael Motes and Julia's is the late Walter Grady Roberts.

In August the blonde had complained about growing up in the shadow of the Pretty Woman star, who has been working the awards circuit this year for her turn in August: Osage County with Meryl Streep.

The younger sibling had said she was 
known as Julia's 'fat little sister' and said the Oscar-winner had 
taunted her about her weight, leading her to undergo weight loss surgery
 in June 2012.

Roberts, 46, made her feel embarrassed and ashamed of
 her weight, according to Nancy, which peaked at 20st.

She resorted to a £20,000 gastric bypass operation last year.

'It makes me feel incredibly hurt and 
very sad,' Motes said. 'When you're in a family of very, very exceptionally beautiful people it's intimidating.'

Her other siblings include Eric Roberts, 57, and Lisa Roberts Gillan, 
48, who are also actors.

Actress Emma Roberts is the daughter of Eric.

'I
 think that growing up as Pretty Woman's little sister has definitely 
made me try to see the person inside and not the person outside,' she added. 'A lot 
of my life I felt judged for my weight.'

Motes, who grew up in the US state of Georgia, was only 13 when 
Roberts shot to Hollywood fame as hooker Vivian Ward in Pretty Woman.

The actress, who had won a Golden 
Globe for playing a young bride in Steel Magnolias, received a second 
for Pretty Woman.

Motes, who described herself as an 'awkward' 
child who was bullied at school, could not compete with the success of 
her 'very pretty and very popular' sister.

New life: Three years ago Nancy, pictured right with Julia, moved back to Los Angeles from Georgia, after meeting her fiancé John Dilbeck. But she claimed Roberts started bullying her about her weight again days after she arrived

She
 said: 'When I was in high school and she was an adult, she would just 
let me know that I was definitely overweight. She would make it quite 
clear to me and in a not so nice manner.

'Julia did not want to see me go
 down that path [of acting] … So I just got a lot of criticism from 
Julia, which was very discouraging for me.'

After
 graduating from high school in 1995, Motes auditioned for roles in Hollywood while 
working as a waitress. But she could not afford to continue so returned 
to Georgia.

With her weight soaring, she 
finally decided to have a gastric bypass fitted.

Motes said she could not afford the £20,000 fee, but rather than ask Roberts, who is worth £90million, for financial help, she took out a 
loan.

She had lost 7st 
since the operation last June and had planned on marrying in May.

However, RadarOnline reported last year that Julia planned to boycott the nuptials because she didn't like the groom and didn't want to get stuck paying for the wedding.

'Julia doesn't think much of Nancy's husband-to-be,' the website quoted an insider as saying. 'She's convinced he's sponging off Nancy, who doesn't have much money in the first place.'

At the time of her death, it was not known if she had mended her relationship with Julia.

She
 said last year: 'It's a work in progress, it's not going to be fixed overnight, 
nor do I think it's going to be fixed by me just getting skinny.'
