As a bombed-out neighbourhood lies in a mass of broken stone and twisted metal in the background, a young boy sits amid the rubble of what was once his home in Gaza.

These images reveal the startling reality of life in the area following the 50-day war with Israel as the region begins to recover from the fighting.

A week after a cease-fire halted the war, families in Gaza have been returning to their homes shelled by Israel during Operation Protective Edge.

Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-ended truce last Tuesday. The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting but left key issues unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of an Israel-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and seaports.

Israel wants Hamas to disarm and the return of bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war. A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.

The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and U.N. estimates. Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants, though it has not provided firm evidence to back its claims. On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.

Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities during the fighting, mostly in the south. The Israeli military, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.

The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools turned into makeshift shelters. With tens of thousands of people still in the shelters and fighting still raging, education officials delayed the start of the school year last week. 

Ziad Thabet, a Gaza Education Ministry official, said classes in the strip are set to begin on September 14. The U.N. said most of the displaced were to be evacuated to temporary housing by yesterday afternoon, but Thabet said the schools need to undergo repairs before they can be used.

At least 223 Gaza schools, either run by the U.N. refugee agency or the Hamas government, were hit in the fighting, including 25 that are too damaged for use. Israel has accused Hamas of using civilian buildings such as schools for military purposes.

Meanwhile, Palestinian militants from the Popular Front for the Liberation Of Palestine took part in a rally on Monday, a week after the beginning of the Egypt-mediated ceasefire.

An opinion poll released today found the popularity of the Hamas militant group had spiked significantly among Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip following the war.

The poll, conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research and headed by leading Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki, indicated that 61 per cent of Palestinians would choose the Islamic militant group's leader, Ismail Haniyeh, for president if Palestinian presidential elections were held today.

Only 32 per cent would vote for current President Mahmoud Abbas, Hamas' rival, the survey suggested.

An opinion poll released today found the popularity of the Hamas militant group had spiked significantly among Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip following the war. Pictured is a masked Palestinian militant of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).

The support for Haniyeh marks a stark increase from a poll in June, conducted by the same pollster, which found only 41 per cent of Palestinians backed the Hamas figure. At the time, Abbas had 53 percent support.

The poll also suggests a majority of Palestinians - 72 per cent - support adopting Hamas' armed approach in the West Bank.

The research center said it is the first time in eight years that a majority of Palestinians has voiced such support for the Hamas leader. But, it said, Hamas' popularity might fall in coming months, as it did following previous Israel-Hamas conflicts.

Polling started on the last day of the war, on August 26, and continued during the first four days of the ceasefire, the research center said.

The poll said 79 per cent of respondents believe Hamas won the war, and 86 per cent support the renewal of rocket fire on Israel if a blockade on Gaza is not lifted, one of Hamas' main demands.

Israeli Finance Minister Yair Lapid criticized Israel's expropriation of West Bank land announced this week, calling for 'a more reasoned approach' in Israeli diplomacy following Israel's military operation in Gaza.

But 25 per cent said armed groups in the Gaza Strip should give up their weapons after the blockade ends and elections are held.

Also today, Israeli Finance Minister Yair Lapid criticized Israel's expropriation of West Bank land announced this week, calling for 'a more reasoned approach' in Israeli diplomacy following Israel's military operation in Gaza.

The expropriation of about 1,000 acres of West Bank land could help clear the way for new Jewish settlement construction. Lapid said such moves create 'redundant arguments with the United States and the world' and criticized the timing of the announcement following the Gaza war. Israel's Justice Minister, Tzipi Livni, also criticized the move this week.

Other leading Israeli Cabinet ministers have criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conduct in the recently concluded war, with many saying he did not go far enough to neutralize Hamas's fighting ability.

Netanyahu has spoken vaguely about a new 'diplomatic horizon' that has emerged following the 50-day Israel-Hamas war. He has given few details on what he means.

But Netanyahu has said that he is not willing to renew peace talks with Abbas, saying the Palestinian leader will have to first distance himself from Hamas militants. Hamas and Abbas' Palestinian Authority recently agreed to a unity deal that saw the formation of a government backed by both factions.

'He has to choose,' Netanyahu told Israeli Channel Two in a weekend interview. 'It's either yes to Hamas or no to Hamas.'

Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars rained on their communities during the 50-day Israel-Hamas war, while schools in Gaza remained shuttered as the territory recovered from the fighting.

The start of school brought a sense of joy and excitement to rocket-scarred communities in southern Israel, but the signs of the fighting remained fresh. In the southern city of Ashdod, employees at the 'Pashosh' kindergarten, which was struck by a rocket, removed shrapnel marks off the walls and slides ahead of the students' arrival.

'We are a little scared but we are excited,' said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher in its school. 'A lot of children in our area really need to go back to a routine.'

In Gaza, Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools turned into makeshift shelters. With tens of thousands of people still in the shelters and fighting still raging, education officials delayed the start of the school year last week.

Ziad Thabet, a Gaza Education Ministry official, said classes in the strip are set to begin on September 14. The U.N. said most of the displaced were to be evacuated to temporary housing by Monday afternoon, but Thabet said the schools need to undergo repairs before they can be used.
