Jailed: Glenn Stacey is back in prison after flouting a town centre ban six times in just two months

A prolific shoplifter with more than 350 convictions is back behind bars after flouting a town centre ban six times in just two months.

Glenn Stacey, who has a long history of stealing low-value items, was given a Criminal Anti-Social Behaviour Order (Crasbo) in February, barring him from the centre of Blackpool, Lancashire.

But 54-year-old Stacey, who is well-known to local security teams, was spotted last month in Poundland. It was the latest breach of his order - and he was sent to prison for 28 days.

Police say the threat of jail does not stop Stacey, but claim the Crasbo means they can at least arrest him before he causes any serious trouble.

Lancashire Constabulary's PC Russell Bargh, of the Blackpool Centre Neighbourhood Policing Team, said: ‘It’s how prolific he is that’s the problem. Jail doesn’t stop him - being inside is just an occupational hazard.

‘I have been an officer for 12 years and the number of convictions he has is well above anyone else I’ve ever come across.  

‘But the Crasbo gives us a chance to arrest him before he manages to commit a crime. It gives us another string to our bow that helps us prevent crime before it gets too far.

‘The order has not been issued lightly. He is not shoplifting because we are getting to him first.’

Michael Hilliard, security officer at Wilkinson’s in Blackpool, said: ‘He was arrested once in here for breaching his order and since then we’ve not seen him.

‘We had stopped him three or four times this year before that so that has got to be good going. He was in all the time before.’

But the nature of Stacey’s offences means he is unlikely to face a significant stretch behind bars any time soon.

PC Bargh added: ‘If you asked town centre stores, they would probably be relieved at a longer period of time but would it stop him committing offences? Probably not.

‘I don’t think Glenn is a particularly nasty person. He just doesn’t see the consequences and he doesnt fear them. I think any officer you ask in Blackpool Central would say they know Glenn.’
