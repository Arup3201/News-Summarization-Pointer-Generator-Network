Humans through the ages have wondered what it is like to be a bird but now hi-tech headwear has revealed the complex hunting strategies of falcons.

U.S. scientists got a bird’s eye view of falcons’ attack strategies by fixing helmets containing tiny cameras to the heads of the birds, which also wore backpacks to record footage of their predatory flights.

They discovered that falcons catch prey in mid-flight by manoeuvring so that their target seems as if it is stationary, which allows them to make their attack with precision.

The scientists worked with 13 falconers in Europe and the U.S. to capture footage of aerial attacks from the birds' point of view  (pictured chasing a crow) and painstakingly logged the position of the birds in each frame of video to reconstruct their attack techniques

Adult falcons have thin tapered wings, which enable them to fly at high speed and to change direction rapidly.

Falcons intercept their prey in mid-air after following it at a distance.

They keep their target in the centre of their field of vision.

To conserve energy, falcons
readjust their flight position so that their prey appears to be 
motionless in relation to the surrounding landscape,

This helps them
 predict the future position of their victim.

Falcons are able to intercept their prey in less time than if they tail it in a straightforward way.

Bats and dragonflies use a similar hunting technique.

Researchers from Haverford College, Pennsylvania explained that the hunting technique allows the birds to intercept their prey in mid-air, without having to follow it closely - giving the predators the element of surprise.

By comparing the position of the targets in the falcons' visual field, they were able to map the bird’s flight path.

This revealed that if the prey appeared at the centre of the falcon’s field of view, the falcon was probably intending to attack it from a distance and was keeping an eye its target's every move.

However, the birds also used more complicated strategies.

Suzanne Kane, from the university, told Live Science, said: ‘This strategy of heading straight toward the prey at all times is easy to implement, but it involves following a very winding pathway and it turns out to be a very inefficient way of catching prey.’

To boost efficiency, the predatory birds readjusted their flight position so that their prey appeared to be motionless in relation to the surrounding landscape, which helped the falcons predict the future position of their victim and conserve energy.

The falcons were able to intercept their prey in less time than if they tailed it, Professor Kane said.

During pursuit, the falcons appeared to 
head off their prey using a strategy called motion camouflage, meaning
 they intercept the prey in the least amount of time while also masking 
its approach.

Previous studies have shown that bats and dragonflies use the same technique.

Professor Kane explained that the falconers made special hoods so that the cameras were fixed tightly to the birds’ heads, but did not impede their view.

‘We had some birds who didn't want to wear them, but overall most were unconcerned with the cameras and tolerated the equipment just fine,’ she said.

The research, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, was based upon data from eight different falcons making flights in the U.S. Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK.

The scientists now aim on investigating other aspects of falcon hunting behaviour, including how the birds select their victims from a flock.

Professor Kane said: ‘Falcons are magnificent, charismatic animals and the falcon’s-eye videos of their hunts are very exciting.

‘I can still say that, even though I have spent hours studying them frame by frame using image analysis software.

‘This is truly nature red in tooth and claw. There is something really primal and moving about watching that elemental struggle between predator and prey.’
