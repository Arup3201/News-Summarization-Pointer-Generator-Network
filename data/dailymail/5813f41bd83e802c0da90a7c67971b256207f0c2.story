Megyn Kelly proved once again that's she's not your typical Fox News talking head when she entered into a debate on working mothers this past Friday.

An argument broke out when she hosted RedState.com editor Erick Erickson, and fellow Fox host Lou Dobbs, in response to a discussion the two men had on Dobbs' show.

The initial discussion centered on a recent Pew study finding that 40 per cent of working mothers were now the breadwinners in their family.Â

Fury: Kelly asked Erickson 'What makes you dominant, and me submissive, and who died and made you scientist-in-chief?'

Erickson found the study troubling, advocating for women to return to their original role in the family.

'When you look at biology, look at the natural world, the roles of a male and a female in society, and other animals, the male typically is the dominant role,' Erickson said 'Lou Dobbs Tonight.' 'The female, it's not antithesis, or it's not competing, it's a complementary role. We as people in a smart society have lost the ability to have complementary relationships in nuclear families, and it's tearing us apart.'

Kelly, a working mother herself, had quite the bone to pick with that view during the heated segment.

'What makes you dominant, and me submissive, and who died and made you scientist-in-chief?'Kelly asked Erickson.

Hitting home: The debate was especially personal for Kelly who herself juggles a full-time job with the responsibilities of being a mother of two

Erickson subsequently brings up the fact that three quarters of those surveyed in the poll agreed with his view.

'Just because you have people who agree with you doesn't mean it's not offensive,' Kelly said.

Erickson wrote a follow-up piece in response to his appearance on Dobbs' show, which Kelly criticized more. Though she said she doesn't describe herself as a feminist, Kelly said she was offended by the piece nonetheless. 'I didn't like what you wrote one bit,' she said.

Things got especially heated when the conversation turned to Dobbs, who blamed the high divorce rate on working mothers.

'Why are you attributing that to women in the workforce?' Kelly asked.

'Excuse me, let me just finish what I'm saying if I may, oh dominant one,' Dobbs retorted to a clearly offended Kelly.

Kelly turned back to Erickson's blog post where she quoted him writing:'The truth - kids most likely will do best in households where they have a mom at home nurturing them while dad is out bringing home the bacon.

Kelly goes on to name four different studies that prove the exact opposite - that children of working mothers turn out just the same as children with stay-at-home mothers.

'I mean, why are we supposed to take your word for it? Erick Erickson's science instead of all of these experts?'

Zing!
