A university student who went on the rampage with a knife on a busy underground train killing four people and injuring more than 20 others has been sentenced to death.

The New Taipei District Court in Taiwan sentenced 21-year-old Cheng Chieh 24 death sentences, one for each of his victims, for the rush-hour attack on a commuter train in the capital Taipei in May last year.

The ruling also deprived Cheng of his civil rights for the rest of his life.

Death sentece: University student Cheng Chieh who went on the rampage with a knife on an underground train killing four people

Cheng Chieh used a 10-centimetre knife to slash passengers in the chest and stomach, in some cases as they slept, whilst travelling in a carriage on the metro system's longest stretch between two stations, the court heard.

He was subdued by police and metro staff after the train pulled into its next station.

He had complained when interviewed about having too much stress in his life and said he wanted to get the death penalty, but also wanted to do something big before he died. 

Cheng was set to obtain a master's degree in business administration and international business from NCKU university in Tainan City this summer. 

When the attack took place, he was in Taipei for a job interview.

He has the right to appeal the verdict but even his parents called for him to be sentenced to death for the attack that also left 22 people injured.

Appearing in court, Cheng showed no reaction when his sentences were announced.

Family members of the deceased who were present in court also welcomed the verdict, saying that giving Cheng the death penalty met public expectations.

Cheng's father Feng agreed, saying: 'Although he is our child, the crime he committed is unforgivable.

'He should be sentenced to death and face it himself. Only by so doing may the pains inflicted on the victims and the wounded and their families be slightly eased.

He urged judges to carry out the sentence as soon as possible saying: 'We hope Cheng Chieh can act in a correct manner during his next life.'

He also said that an apology was meaningless and could not ease his pain. He said he can only hope that there will be no recurrences of such an incident in Taiwan.

Court spokeswoman Lien Yu-chyun said the New Taipei City district court considered 'the vicious nature of the method that the defendant ... used to kill to be significant'.

She cited public outrage over the case and said that Cheng would be 'hard to reform'.

Before the attack, Cheng posted a message on his Facebook page saying he 'wanted to do something big'. He told authorities later that the stabbings felt 'like slicing tofu,' according to local news reports.

Ahead of the verdict, Taiwan's Apple Daily newspaper quoted him as saying that he would not mind receiving a death sentence.

Taiwanese book publisher and historian Yang Lian-fu said: 'People are likely to support Cheng's sentence, with some considering him 'a monster that rose from hell'.'

But Yang added that some Taiwanese worry that the case points to problems in preparing young people for the homework, job searches and family pressures that have intensified over the past 40 years.

Cheng has been described as a homebody who was fond of computer games but who complained about the stress in his life for which the only way out was the death penalty.

Yang warned however that there may be other instances, saying: 'Cheng Chieh is an isolated case, but his isolated case has its place in today's society. 

There are people who are lost or there are things in society that make them feel unsatisfied, like they have no goals in life.'

The verdict adds to Taiwan's death row total that stands at more than 100. The number of executions, which are carried out by shooting, declined after 2000 due to public opposition, with none between 2006 and 2009. 

They resumed in 2010 following a change in president and renewed sentiment in favour of the policy.
