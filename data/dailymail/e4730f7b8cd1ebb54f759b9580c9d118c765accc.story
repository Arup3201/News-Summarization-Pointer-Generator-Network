A man has smashed the  record for growing the hottest chillies in the UK - by shouting at them.

Matt Simpson, 43, grew the super hot British peppers by stressing them throughout the whole growing process.

He denied them water, pretended to be a predator by ripping bits off - as he believes the heat is a natural defence against being eaten - and even shouted at them.

Mistreated chillies: Mr Simpson was tempted to get someone from the Army to shout at the plants but decided otherwise, saying 'that would have been embarrassing'

The mouth-watering result, a variety of the chinensis family, named the Katie, measured a whopping 1,590,000 Scoville units compared to the previous record of 1,389,000.

He also produced a 'baby sister' chilli called 'Lucy - which measured a staggering 1,359,284 on the scale.

The hottest chillies from around the world measure at least a million on the scale.

Mr Simpson, the co-founder of Simpson's Seeds and Plants, said: 'We used a form of stressing to make the chillies even hotter.

'No one has done tests but the BBC did a show about eight years ago where they spoiled and mistreated some chillies. The mistreated ones came out much hotter.

'We denied them water so they began to wither. In my opinion, they also produce heat to defend against animals so I pretended to be an animal too.

'I broke off bits to make the plant think it was being eaten.

'I tried shouting at them as well but I haven't got that strong a voice. I was tempted to get someone from the Army to shout at them but that would have been embarrassing.'

The chillies are so hot that Mr Simpson had to wear two pairs of gloves and other protective clothing

Developed by Mr Simpson's friend, the UK's hottest chilies were named Katie and Lucy

Mr Simpson grew the two varieties of chilli after they were developed by a friend. They were named 'Katie' and 'Lucy' after the developer's daughters.

Grown in a poly-tunnel in Horningsham, Wiltshire, between the spring and autumn, the chillies are so hot he had to wear two pairs of gloves and other protective clothing.

'Katie' will now be made into a sauce, called KT-Extinction, and sold at festivals.

Mr Simpson said: 'We grew both varieties this summer and sent pods off to be tested. We were a little disappointed that the Lucy, which was thought to be the hotter of the two, was a tiny bit under the record.

'We were, however, delighted when the results of a pod test came in later from the University of Bath for Katie.

'It smashed the British record and beat the old one by 200,000 Scovilles.

'After trying a tiny bit I knew they were hot but I am overwhelmed by the results. I think we can thank the Indian summer we had. Let's see if we can better it next year.'

The Scoville scale is the measurement of the spicy heat (pungency) of chilli peppers or other spicy foods.

Created by American pharmacist Wilbur Scoville in 1912, the Scoville Organoleptic Test records Scoville heat units based on the concentration of capsaicin.
