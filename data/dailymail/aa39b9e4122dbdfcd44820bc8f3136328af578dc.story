Controversial payday lender Wonga has agreed with Newcastle United to remove its logo from all children's replica shirts and training wear from the 2016/17 season.

Earlier this year, the payday loan giant was ordered to pay compensation of £2.6million to 45,000 customers who were harassed with threatening letters from firms that it invented to chase debts. 

Its sponsorship of the north-east club was criticised by fans as well as players, with striker Papiss Cisse the most strongly opposed. 

The Senegalese player initially said he did not want to support a money-lending organisation - who have annual interest rates of up to 5,853 per cent - for religious reasons but eventually gave in and agreed to wear the shirt.

Senegalese player Papiss Cisse strongly objected to wearing shirts with the sponsor on and it will now be removed from Newcastle United's training kit for the 2016/2017 season 

Wonga said the decision followed a review of its marketing launched by new chairman Andy Haste in July to ensure none of it could inadvertently appeal to the very young or vulnerable.

It has already ended its puppet advertising campaign.

The company said the logo was being removed from children's kit at the earliest possible opportunity, and that due to kit production schedules this would be from the start of the 2016/17 season - the last season of the current shirt sponsorship deal.

The pay day loans industry has been fiercely criticised by leading figures including the Archbishop of Canterbury, who suffered embarrassment when it was revealed that the Church of England had indirectly invested funds in Wonga.

Last month, it wrote off a total of £220 million worth of debt belonging to 330,000 customers after admitting making loans to people who could not afford to repay them.

While the company presented itself as the ethical face of the payday loans industry with its friendly TV ad puppets, the investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority found extensive evidence of ‘thuggish’ behaviour.

Among Wonga’s victims threatened by the fake legal team was a woman who missed repayments because she was in hospital recovering from a miscarriage. 

But Mr Haste has promised to clean up the company as he admitted it had made 'serious mistakes'.

Wonga said it now expected to become 'smaller and less profitable' in the near term following the changes. 

Darryl Bowman, Wonga marketing director said: 'As a responsible lender we believe removing our logo from children's replica shirts and training wear is the right thing to do. We appreciate the club's support in this matter.'

Newcastle United managing director Lee Charnley said: 'We understand and respect Wonga's position and are happy to support their decision.'
