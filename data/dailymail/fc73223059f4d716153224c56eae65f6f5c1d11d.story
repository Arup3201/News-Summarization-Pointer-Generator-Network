Ambulance bosses have apologised for delays in reaching a six-year-old girl who choked to death on holiday in Wales.

It took 16 minutes - double the target time - for two community first responders to reach Jasmine Lapsley, who was staying with her family at a holiday home in Lon Bodlondeb, in Morfa Nefyn, North Wales. She later died in hospital.

The Welsh Ambulance Service’s NHS Trust has launched an investigation into their handling of the emergency and offered their offered their 'sincere apologies.'

However, Jasmine's family said they were disappointed that the ambulance service made no contact with them following her death and were unaware an inquiry was even on-going.

The family from Anfield, Liverpool, praised emergency officers and local people who tried to assist Jasmine after she started choking in August.

An RAF rescue helicopter, from Prince William's former HQ in Anglesey, flew her the 20 miles to hospital in Banger where she later died. 

Local county councillor Liz Saville Roberts, called on the Welsh Government to review response targets, particularly in rural areas, in the wake of the incident.

The prospective parliamentary candidate has also raised a number of concerns with the ambulance trust. 

'This terribly sad event focuses concerns about the nature of rural ambulance services, and how often ambulances are located in Pwllheli and thus on call for emergencies in the Llyn,' she said.

An inquest was expected to take place into Jasmine's death later this month.

'I have spoken to Jasmine's family,' said cllr Roberts

'Mr and Mrs Lapsley wish to praise the emergency officers and local people who gave every assistance.

'Nonetheless, they are disappointed that the ambulance services have made no contact since the event, and did not inform them that this inquiry was on-going.'

In a letter to Cllr Roberts, Tracy Myhill, interim chief executive at the Wales Ambulance Service, said: 'I offer my most sincere apologies for the anxiety that this incident caused to Cllr Roberts and the people of the Llyn area.

'I can confirm that there is a vehicle working from the Pwllheli station 24 hours per day, seven days per week. In addition to this vehicle there is a further vehicle working from the Pwllheli station between 10am and 11pm, Monday to Saturday.

'There are three Community First Responders teams in the Llyn area.'

Cllr Roberts said: 'It is appreciated that the Welsh Ambulance Services Trust has apologised for the distress caused by events surrounding Jasmine's death. Nonetheless, their delayed response - two and a half months after the tragedy - reveals no more information than was previously in the public domain.

'I call on the Welsh Government to review over-simplistic targets because the present approach is resulting in a two-tier service, dependent on whether a life-threatening emergency occurs within the eight-minute priority area or beyond the pale.'

A spokesman for the Wales Ambulance Service said: 'The trust has reported this tragic incident to Welsh Government as a Serious Adverse Incident (SAI). SAI reports require a comprehensive and detailed investigation, and the trust endeavors to complete the investigation by mid to late-November.

'The trust received a formal concern from Cllr Liz Saville Roberts to which we have responded. The Trust has also agreed to attend the next meeting of Gwynedd's Services Scrutiny Committee where ambulance service provision will be discussed, this is likely to be next February.

'Our thoughts and condolences remain with the family of the little girl at this sad and difficult time.' 

 After Jasmine's death her father, Robert, said: ‘Jasmine was full of love, life, energy and enthusiasm for her family, friends and her so many interests. She was truly a shining light in our lives.’
