Four Pakistani men have been sentenced the death for stoning their pregnant female relative to death in front of her husband because they did not approve of their marriage.

Farzana Iqbal, 25, was attacked in broad daylight on May 27 by her father, brother, cousin, and another relative on the steps of a top court in the city of Lahore.

With police witnesses reportedly doing nothing to stop the sickening murder, Mrs Iqbal was savagely beaten for 15 minutes and had bricks thrown at her as she arrived at the court to defend her husband Mohammed on charges of her abduction brought by her family.  

Mrs Iqbal's shocking murder in May briefly focused international attention on Pakistan's epidemic of violence against women.

Women are murdered every day in Pakistan for perceived slights against conservative social traditions. The crime is so common it rarely rates more than a paragraph in newspapers.

This morning Ms Iqbal's father, brother, cousin, and another relative were all sentenced to death and given a £600 fine, their defence lawyer Mansoor Afridi said.

Another cousin was sentenced to 10 years in prison and also fined £600. 

Pakistan currently has a moratorium on executions, meaning
death row prisoners are effectively sentenced to life
imprisonment.

But Afridi said the family planned to appeal, claiming the the verdict was 'a decision based on sensationalism.' The state prosecutor was not immediately available for
comment.

Mrs Iqbal's shocking murder in May briefly focused international attention on Pakistan's epidemic of violence against women. Hundreds of women are murdered in so-called 'honour killings' every year

Mrs Iqbal's case attracted attention because it took place
on a busy street outside the provincial High Court where she had
gone to seek protection. 

Her family beat her to death with
bricks while her husband, Muhammed Iqbal, begged nearby police
for help. They did not intervene.

Iqbal later admitted that he had murdered his first wife to
marry Farzana. He escaped punishment because his son forgave
him. In Pakistani law, a woman's next of kin can
forgive her murderers.

Since Pakistani women are often killed by their close
relations, the loophole allows thousands of murderers to escape
without punishment.

In 2013, 869  so-called 'honour killings' were
reported in the media, according to the Human Rights Commission
of Pakistan. The true figure is probably higher since many cases
go unreported.
