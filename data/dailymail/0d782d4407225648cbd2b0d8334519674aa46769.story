A teenager accused of shooting and stabbing an elderly stranger to death had penned a detailed list of plans including 'select prey' and 'enjoy kill', according to reports.

Maxwell Winkler, 17, was found riding his bike through a wooded area near to the murder scene in Fishers, Indiana on Monday, two days after Henry Kim, 73, was found killed in Windermere Park.

After they took the high school student into custody, police went to his mother's house and found the notes inside a wallet, according to court documents seen by the Indianapolis Star.

'Prepare site and prepare tools for cleanup,' the notes read. 'Select prey. Wait and act inauspicious (play with phone and wave) till prey passes by to strike or surprise attack using bike near site.

'Sick': High school student Maxwell Winkler, 17, left, has been accused of shooting and stabbing 73-year-old Henry Kim, right, to death as he took a walk through an Indiana park on Saturday evening

'Enjoy kill. Get back to safe site to clean up. Clean up, pack up. Get the hell out of Dodge.'

In a second page of the notes, he wrote about burning all of the items he had used in the killing - apart from a 'trophy' that he intended to keep. 

The instructions also contain a list of supplies he needed for before, during and after the murder, including 'kill tools', bottled water and trash bags.

His arrest came after a series of clues lead police to identify him as their suspect, records show.

Over the weekend, after Kim was found dead, schoolmates contacted authorities to say that Winkler had been acting strangely, the Indianapolis Star reported. 

Haunting: Police allegedly found these sheets of instructions inside Winkler's wallet after they took him into custody. The instructions included things he would need for the killing and his plan of action

Plot: As well as the notes, police allegedly found a gun that matched with the murder weapon inside Winkler's home and bloody towels and gloves in his trash. Friends and teachers also said he was acting stranegly

Police went to his home on Sunday morning and, as they searched through trash outside the house, they came across dark gloves and a blood-stained towel, the documents show.

On Monday, a teacher at his school, Hamilton Southeastern High, contacted police investigating the death of Mr Kim to say that boy had shaved and cut his hair over the weekend.

A school resource officer also told authorities how, two years earlier, Winkler had written a letter titled 'My Bucket List', which included: 'Killing, mass destruction and weapons of mass destruction.'

As police searched the area near the murder scene on Monday evening, they came across a bizarre camp made from sticks and tape that was littered with ammo, records show.

While in the woods, Winkler approached them on his bike - which appeared to be the same kind described by witnesses near the crime scene - and police took him into custody.

Taken into custody: Winkler is seen with police officers after he was found in a wooded area near the crime scene on Monday night. After they approached him, he said, unprompted: 'I didn't kill anyone'

They also found two folding knives on him and one appeared to have dried blood on the edge, according to documents.

As the teenager was taken into custody, he said, unprompted: 'I didn't kill anyone,' records show.

Police later searched his mother and father's separate homes where they found the notes, ammo and a .22-caliber gun. The parents also handed over medication the boy had been taking.

Ammo from a .22 had been found near Kim's body and also near the windows of a car that had been shot out on the night of the murder, police said.

Kim's body was found in Windermere Park in Fishers at 7pm on Saturday by a dog walker.

He had been shot three times - in the cheek, in the back and in the left upper arm - and also had a deep wound to the front of his neck, the Hamilton County Coroner's Office said, WISHTV reported.

Wanted: Before his arrest, authorities had released images of a mountain bike owned by a person of interest in the case. When he was found in a wooded area on Monday, Winkler was on his bike, police said

Clues: The person on the bike, who was wearing a helmet like this one, was seen riding from the scene

His family said he was likely out on his daily walk when he was attacked, the IndyStar reported.

A friend told WISHTV that Kim was recently diagnosed with diabetes so went on the walks to improve his health. 

After the killing, police released images of a Trek mountain bike and a BMX helmet believed to belong to a potential suspect. The man whose van windows had been shot at had called police with the description. 

The high school student was arrested around 5am on Tuesday and has now been charged with murder and is being held without bond. He will be charged with an adult in the case.   

Winkler is a student at Hamilton Southeastern High School, and detectives said he lives in the neighborhood near Windermere Park, the IndyChannel reported.  

Scene: Henry Kim's body was found by a dogwalker at Windermere Park (pictured) in Fishers on Saturday

Investigation: Police Sergeant Tom Weger said the victim and the suspect did not know each other

Kim was a married father who had lived in Fishers for more than 15 years.

On Sunday, his son Steve, 43, wrote on Facebook: 'I lost my father last night... Feeling sad. He was found dead shot twice in the face in the park. He had no enemies.'

The killing comes just four months after an 18-year-old was stabbed during a party - the first homicide in the area in nearly two decades, police said.

Connor Shockley was killed on June 22 during a gathering in the Harrison Green area and an 18-year-old classmate was charged in his death.

Winkler is next due in court on January 13 and a trial in scheduled for next April.
