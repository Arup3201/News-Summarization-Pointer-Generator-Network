Revenge porn: Blogger and mother of two Melissa Esplin was shocked to find herself on a 'revenge porn' website

Melissa Esplin is a blogger, a calligrapher and a proud mother of two - and if you believe everything you read on the Internet, she also poses for nude, sexually explicit photos on the Internet.Â 

Esplin is one of hundreds - if not thousands - of victims of a new extortion scheme where 'revenge porn' websites take innocent, fully clothed photos of women and crop their heads onto another woman's naked body. They then post the photos on their websites with the woman's full name, city and other contact information.

If the woman complains, the owner of the website will often charge her a fee - oftentimes hundreds of dollars - to remove the photos.

In Esplin's case, she didn't realize that her image appeared on a porn website until she woke up one morning with an inbox full of emails from men around the world propositioning her for sex.

'I was like, what's going on? This is kind of ridiculous,' Esplin told KSL.

She was shocked when she found her photos and her contact information on a 'revenge porn' website - and even more shocked when some very PG photos she posted on the Internet had been turned into pornography with her face on the nude body of someone else.

Esplin, who lives in Salt Lake City, Utah, with her husband and two young kids, contacted the website and asked that the photos be removed immediately. She says she was given the option to have the photos removed, but that she would have to pay $400.

Blogger: Esplin runs a successful crafts blog and has uploaded several photos of herself onto her site - thinking they were safe

Esplin, who operates a successful craft blog and has an online calligraphy business, relies on the Internet for much of her livelihood. She says the 'revenge porn' phenomenon is something she'd never be a part of.

'That's not an aspect of the Internet that I ever interact with,' Esplin
 told KSL. 'And it's just -- I hate seeing the underbelly of the 
Internet.'

She's also concerned that appearing on a porn website could hurt her business - as well as her reputation.

'The fact that possibly my name had been sullied and my name is my image and my image is my business,' she said.

Take action: Esplin says anyone who finds themselves the victim of a 'revenge porn' scam should immediately call the FBI

Esplin has refused to pay the fee and reported the website to the FBI. However, because the site is registered overseas - and through shadowy companies - there isn't much the FBI can do.

Stateside, Utah is one of many states addressing 'revenge porn' websites - an anti-revenge porn bill just passed in both houses of the state's legislature and is awaiting a signature from the governor.

Other states with 'revenge porn' legislation in the works include Georgia, Tennessee and Florida.

Esplin's advice to anyone who may fall victim to one of these websites: 'When it does happen, don't let it waste your time. Contact authorities, get on it right away and move on.'
