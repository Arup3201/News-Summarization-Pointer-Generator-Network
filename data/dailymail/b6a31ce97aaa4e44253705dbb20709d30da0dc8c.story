Ewen Geoffrey Peter, 68, has been arrested in Cambodia on sex charges

A British man who ran website for 'best Thai woman' in Devon has been arrested in Cambodia on sex charges.

Officials named the man as 68-year-old Geoffrey Peter Ewen, although Cambodian police are known to often get the names of foreigners muddled.

The Briton was arrested in the southern resort of Sihanoukville on charges which include filming her naked against her will.

‘He confessed that he sexually assaulted his girlfriend and produced pornography,’ provincial deputy police chief Mam Makal told the Cambodia Daily website.

A Cambodian website used by expatriates claimed that the man had also hired a Vietnamese woman for sex and that police believed the video was being shot for commercial purposes.

According to police, Peter has been a regular visitor to Cambodia.

He was said to have met his alleged victim, a 20-year-old woman, at the Dream Bar in Sihanoukville, a drinking establishment which claims to have the ‘most beautiful girls in Sihanoukville’,and where a draft beer sells for just 75 cents.

They began a sexual relationship, but a week later the woman went to police.

She claimed that she had caught Peter videoing her as she left the bathroom naked - and that he had used a sex toy against her will while they were having sex.

Mr Makal said police raided the guesthouse where the Briton was staying and seized a computer, camera, sex toys and a generic form of Viagra.

Police photographed him in his room wearing a red Arsenal T-shirt.

Geoffrey Peter Ewen is a former director of a now-dissolved company called Tiger Stop Ltd, with an address in Teignmouth, Devon.

On its website it carries a promotion for 'Thai women', which invites readers interested in 'best Thai women' to register for free.

Just last January Briton Stuart Green, 47, from Eccles was found dead in a Phnom Penh hotel room after reportedly taking his life while police were hunting him for the murder of a 20-year-old local woman.

Cambodia was one of the haunts of notorious paedophile Gary Glitter, who fled the country and set up home in neighbouring Vietnam.

He was arrested and jailed on child molestation charges before being deported to Britain.
