A dejected dog spent three hours tied to a lamppost on Valentine's Day after his owner abandoned him with a note saying 'needs a new home'. 

The Staffordshire Bull Terrier was found in a dark alleyway in Erith, south east London, on Saturday night - with a piece of twine attached to his lead and a sheet of paper in front of him.

He is the second sad-looking Staffie to have been dumped by his owner in the last week - and some blame the trend on the negative attention the breed gets following attacks on people.

Abandoned and alone: This dejected dog spent three hours tied to a lamppost on Valentine's Day after his owner dumped him in an alleyway in east London with a note saying 'needs a new home'

RSPCA officers who discovered the latest abandoned pooch nicknamed him Valentino.

Joanna Bishop, an inspector for the animal charity, said: 'Poor Valentino was dumped on Valentine's Day.

'He is such a lovely dog too. Beautiful, in really good condition with a shiny coat, and a really sweet nature.

'The only word to describe the way he was sitting there under that street light in the dark alley is bewildered. His face seemed to say "Why am I here?"

Another unwanted Staffie: This dog, left outside Eastbourne Railway last week,  cut a forlorn figure and appeared to be so saddened by his situation that tears were coming from his eyes

'I didn't get the impression he'd been mistreated before this point - and then found himself suddenly in a cold, dark alleyway, without any food, water or care.

'He was just sitting there flummoxed wondering what had happened and where his owner had gone - just very confused and sad. He was a blue Staffy with the blues.'

Valentino's luck soon changed as he was adopted by a new owner after just a day in the kennels.

Last week another black Staffordshire Bull Terrier was abandoned outside Eastbourne Railway Station, East Sussex, tied to the railing and left with just a small pot of water by his owner who fled in a taxi. 

A photo of the animal, looking forlorn, has been shared dozens of times on the internet with people calling for help for the 'crying' dog. 

Hugely popular: Kai became the most popular dog in the Scottish SPCA's history after he was found tied to railings outside Ayr station with just a suitcase containing his favourite pillow, bowl and toy

Happy ending: Ian Russell, 52, (right) was chosen by the Scottish SPCA from a list of hundreds of people who wanted to give Kai a new home

The dog was found whining and pining for his owner after patiently waiting by the railing for more than an hour on February 11 in the hope that he would return.

When no one turned up to collect the lonely dog he was reported abandoned and taken into the care of Eastbourne Borough Council. 

Another high-profile abandoning was that of Kai, the Shar-Pei crossbreed.

He became the most popular dog in the Scottish SPCA's history after he was found tied to railings outside Ayr station with just a suitcase containing his favourite pillow, bowl and toy.

Ian Russell, 52, was chosen by the Scottish SPCA from a list of hundreds of people who wanted to give him a home.
