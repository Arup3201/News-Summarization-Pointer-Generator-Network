A cruise is a great way to enjoy the Mediterranean in summer. What could be more relaxing after some sightseeing than sitting on deck with a cool drink as you sail away to the next exciting destination? 

It certainly beats the bother of driving on a touring holiday, and gives so much more variety than staying put at a beach resort. Fly to join your ship and your sunshine holiday starts on day one.

Island-hopping in Greece is easy and fun on a cruise, and it is the nimble smaller ships that are able to visit the biggest choice of ports.

Here are five of the best cruises this summer with interesting itineraries and on-board activities…

1) During a ten-night round-trip from Istanbul aboard Azamara Journey (azamaraclubcruises.co.uk, 0844 493 4016), there are late stays in port, giving passengers the opportunity to dine ashore or take a stroll after dinner on lively Mykonos and in Chania, Crete.

 All guests are invited to an ‘AzAmazing Evening’ – a special choral performance in the magnificent baroque St John’s Co-Cathedral in Valletta, built by the Knights of Malta. 

Sit back and enjoy the local cocktails on Mykonos while someone else do all the hard work for you... 

Departure is on August 6 and the cruise costs from £1,699pp (saving £676pp) if booked in March – you must quote ‘FREE AIR’. 

All fares include flights, drinks, gratuities and the AzAmazing Evening.
