A family of five says its four-star holiday to Turkey was ruined by illness and one of them tested positive for salmonella following their return to England.

Cheryll Jordan, 45, and her husband Ian, 46 have hired solicitors  to investigate the cause of the illness and seek compensation from tour operator Thomas Cook if the hotel is found to be culpable.

The couple travelled with their three children to Hotel Marmaris Palace resort in Dalaman in June this year, expecting 10 days of sun, sea and relaxation.

Distressed: Cheryll and Ian Jordan fell ill during their stay at Marmaris Palace in Dalaman in Turkey last June

Marmaris Palace: Earlier this year as many as 25 other children allegedly fell ill while staying at the  resort

But the couple say they are angry and upset after they and their seven-year-old son Lewis fell ill with sickness, diarrhoea and abdominal pains a few days into the trip.

It left them confined to their hotel room and still suffering symptoms four months on.

 Bailey, 13, and the couple's other son Luckas, 5 were the only family members to escape illness. On returning home to Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, the family saw their GP and Ian was 'appalled' to be told he had tested positive for salmonella.

As a result, Ian had to take one week off work and the Council's Environmental Health Department said it would be investigating the illness. 

Nightmare holiday: The family has instructed expert illness lawyers at Irwin Mitchell to investigate the cause

Earlier this year it was claimed that as many as 25 children had been struck down by severe sickness while on a summer holiday at the same Turkish resort.

Following the incident six families reportedly launched legal action against Marmaris Palace and tour operator Thomas Cook after their children were among those allegedly suffering vomiting and diarrhoea, although Thomas Cook declined to comment on what stage these proceedings were now at.

The Jordan family have now instructed travel law experts at Irwin Mitchell to investigate the cause of their illness.

Bailey, 13, Lewis, 7, and Luckas, 5 were looking forward to the 10-day trip but Lewis fell ill

Jennifer Downing, an international personal injury specialist at Irwin Mitchell, said: 'We are concerned by the Jordan family's reports of the illness they suffered while staying at the Marmaris Palace resort in Dalaman.

'Their holiday was ruined by gastric symptoms and we are particularly concerned by Ian's salmonella diagnosis.

'We have seen on numerous occasions the severe impact salmonella can have on victims in the short and longer-term, as it can often lead to the development of long-standing health conditions, from which they may never fully recover.

'We are now investigating the cause of the illness and hope that tour operator Thomas Cook will work with us as we seek the answers to our clients' concerns.'

Playing in the pool: Cheryll said the holiday was a 'horrendous experience' and they fell sick a few days in

Cheryll recalls: 'This was our first all-inclusive holiday abroad as a family but it was just a massive disappointment.

'Myself, my husband and my seven-year-old son all suffered diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pains. It was a horrendous experience and we all felt so drained by our illness that we couldn't enjoy our holiday.

'As the break went on, we noticed that some of the food was being served undercooked and some of the utensils and crockery were dirty. Some of the fresh food appeared to be added to trays with existing food and on some occasions it seemed like the same food was reused and served later in the day.

Ian adds: 'I am appalled that I contracted Salmonella while on holiday and I continued to suffer with symptoms of the illness months after returning to the UK.

'Falling ill when you go on holiday to a four-star hotel is not something you expect or are prepared for. We have now instructed Irwin Mitchell to investigate the cause of our illness and to help us get the answers we want about what caused us to be so ill.'

Marmaris Palace: A Thomas Cook spokesperson says its investigation into the illness continues

A Thomas Cook spokesperson said: 'Thomas Cook takes health and hygiene issues very seriously and maintaining the safety of our customers is our number one priority. We confirm that the Jordan family reported falling ill while on holiday in June 2014 at the Hotel Marmaris Palace in Dalaman, Turkey. 

'We would like to assure customers that incidents of this type are rare, and Thomas Cook operates both a quality assurance programme and routinely undertakes independent third party audits to ensure that the very highest hygiene standards are maintained.'

'While our investigation into the illness continues, we are unable to provide further comment so as not to unduly influence any potential legal proceedings.'

'We are confident that those due to stay at the Hotel Marmaris Palace will experience the excellent levels of quality and standards they would expect from Thomas Cook.'
