A 22-year-old man died from a severe allergic reaction to the milk in his oatmeal after spending one night in custody over a misdemeanour charge for marijuana use.

An autopsy report from the Snohomish County medical examiner revealed that Michael Saffioti died from bronchial asthma triggered by the consumption of dairy after spending a single night in the Snohomish County Jail in Washington State.

Now his mother, Rose Saffioti, is suing the county for what she said is his wrongful death.

Tragic: Michael Saffioti, 22, who suffered from severe food allergies and asthma, died from an allergic reaction while spending the night in prison for a misdemeanour offense

Request denied? He had requested to spend the night in the Snohomish County's medical facility, but was instead put in with the general population

On July 2, Saffioti turned himself in to police, after his mother Rose Saffioti assured him it was the right thing to do, and that he would be out the next day.

Mrs Saffioti told The Herald newspaper of Everett that despite reassurances that the prison staff would take his medical needs into consideration, her son was scared.

‘He said, “Mom, I have a bad feeling that they are not going to take me seriously.”’

The mother, from Mukiteo, Washington, said that her son brought along a bag of medications needed to control his allergies and asthma, and he had expected to be placed in the jail's medical unit.

Instead, he was placed in the general population.

Mrs Saffioti received a call the next morning to inform her that her son was dead.

She said that she has spoken with other inmates who were there. Many of them knew her son, and called him ‘Bubble Boy’ because of his debilitating allergy to dairy. 

Mrs Saffioti believes the cause might have been what he was served for breakfast on July 3 – oatmeal with milk, and that her son’s death could have been prevented.

She also said that her son’s desperate pleas for help went ignored. 

She has since filed a wrongful death claim against Snohomish county.

Ann Bremner, Mrs Saffioti’s attorney, told Q13 FOX that the guards thought the 22-year-old’s cries for help were fabricated. ‘The response from the guards was something like this,’ she said. ‘”If you don’t cut it out, you’re going to be in the hole.”’

A report from the Snohomish County medical examiner’s office released earlier this week revealed that he died from bronchial asthma brought on by his milk allergy.

Mrs Saffioti said that her son's allergies were so severe that he had to ask what a girl had eaten that day before he could kiss her.

The sheriff's office said that its investigation is on-going.

Friends and family of the young man told the Herald that Saffioti’s substance abuse problem stemmed from anxiety produced his medical condition.

He used the pot to calm his nerves, they said.
