The glamorous woman accused of helping the Manhattan Madam run a high-end prostitution ring appeared briefly in court today, sporting a sombre new look.

Jaynie Baker, 30, the alleged accomplice of Soccer Mom Madam Anna Gristina, showed up in court sporting straight blonde locks and spectacles.

Two weeks before, she appeared at the court in lower Manhattan with tumbling strawberry blonde curls, looking much more at ease with herself.

Buttoned up: Jaynie Mae Baker, centre, leaves court with her attorney, Robert Gottlieb, right and her sister, Jessica Baker, left; it's a much more reserved look for the glamorous 'fixer'

Make-under: Baker looked glamorous and at ease at her first court appearance March 13, left; appearing in court today, she sported shorter, blonder locks and a cold attitude

Though she's changed her look, 
Baker’s lawyer Robert Gottlieb told the press outside the court that 
this is far from enjoyable for either of them.

‘This is a very difficult time for her,’ he said. ‘This is not fun.’

He added: ‘She takes it very seriously,’ referring to the allegations she is facing that she was promoting prostitution.

Baker was also accompanied by her younger sister, Jessica. She was wearing sky-blue pants, sensible nude heels, and a cream-coloured coat with high collar.

At the appearance, prosecutors gave Mr Gottlieb affidavits submitted to persuade a judge to sign 
off on wiretapping in the case.

Those documents are not public.

It's not uncommon for prosecutors to turn them over at this stage in a case.

Stoic: She resolutely looked off into the distance as she made her appearance, tight-lipped and in a high-collared coat and glasses

Day in court: Baker is next due in court on April 20

He said he'll decide on his next step after reviewing the information.  Baker, meanwhile, is due back in court April 20.

Baker, who lives in the Williamsburg 
neighbourhood of Brooklyn, was arrested March 13. In previous court 
appearances, Baker has appeared at ease and relaxed.

During her arrival today, however, she scowled at reporters behind wireless frames with transition lenses.

Mr Gottlieb said his client is under a
lot of stress; ‘She’s facing serious criminal charges, plus all the 
unwanted attention is something she is not enjoying.’

Media swarm: Baker and her attorney were swarmed by cameras as they leaved court in lower Manhattan

Baker allegedly helped Gristina run high-end escort service, booking prostitutes for up to $2,000 a visit.

The pretty blonde claimed to work for New York dating company VIP Life, which legitimately supplies wealthy clients with well-to-do women who are searching for love.

If convicted, Baker faces up to seven years in jail.

Gristina allegedly earned up to $10million while running her operation.

While Baker is free on $200,000 bail, 
the Soccer Mom Madam remains in solitary confinement at Rikers – she was
unable to post her $2million bond.
