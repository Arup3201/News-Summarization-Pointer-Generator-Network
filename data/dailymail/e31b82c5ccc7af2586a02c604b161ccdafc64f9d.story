Ash dieback has spread the length and breadth of England, official data shows.

The devastating disease affecting ash trees, first detected in Britain in East Anglia in 2012, is now found from Cornwall to Northumberland.

It has also spread into a handful of sites in Scotland and Wales, information published by the Forestry Commission shows.

The number of British woods affected by the disease has tripled in little over two years, with nearly 1,000 sites showing signs of the fungus that causes it.

In December 2012 the microscopic fungus chalara fraxinea was found in 291 sites. On January 6 this year officials found the disease in 949 sites. Most experts now accept there is little chance of killing the disease, with all activity focused on simply slowing its spread.

But the new report suggests that the Government's efforts so far have made little impact.

More than £16.5million has been spent tackling ash dieback and other tree diseases, including trying to find a strain of ash resistant to the chalara fungus.

That search has so far been fruitless and scientists believe the ash problem will eventually spread into every woodland in the country.

The problem is the biggest threat to British woodlands since Dutch elm disease killed off 25million mature trees in the 1970s and 1980s.

It could have a huge impact on other species. A total of 955 species rely on ash trees, including wood mice, squirrels, bullfinches, wrens, bats and beetles.

Of these, 45 species rely solely on ash, including the large ash bark beetle, centre-barred sallow moth and scarce yellow pinter crane fly which are all likely to become extinct in Britain.

Elizabeth Truss, Environment Secretary, said: 'We are doing all we can on ash dieback. It is a serious issue' 

Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss accepts there is no quick answer to the problem. 'We are doing all we can on ash dieback. It is a serious issue,' she told The Sunday Telegraph. 

'We're looking at various ways of dealing with it but we don't have a magic bullet. We don't have a solution and we're still carrying out research on that.'

The disease, which causes rapid leaf loss, works particularly quickly on young plants, killing them within a year. Older trees can withstand the initial infection but tend to die after several seasons of attacks.

The disease was first recorded in Poland in 1992, but was unheard of in Britain until late 2012. It is believed to have been introduced by spores blown across the Channel or by imported saplings.

Restrictions on the movement of ash plants were introduced two years ago but the disease has continued to spread.
