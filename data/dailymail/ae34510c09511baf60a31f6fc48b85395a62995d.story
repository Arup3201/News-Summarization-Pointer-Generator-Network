From Cinderella and her glass slipper to the tragic tale of the Little Mermaid, fairytales are a quintessential part of childhood.

Now some of the world's best-loved stories have been brought to life in a collection of beautifully illustrated new books - just in time for Christmas.

The Grey and Orange Fairy Books were collated by Andrew Lang, a 19th century Scottish poet and anthropologist who made it his life's work to collect and translate children's tales from all over the globe.

But although the tales are old, the spectacular Illustrations come courtesy of two very modern artists: Croatian Tomislav Tomić and American Lauren Nassef.

Among the tales featured in the books, which are part of a set that includes new editions of the Crimson Fairy Book and the Yellow Fairy Book, are those of the Ugly Duckling, the Sunchild, the Queen of the Flowery Isles and the Little Mermaid.

Each of the books in the collection, published by The Folio Society, features the work of a different artist commissioned to produce bespoke illustrations for the series.

Explaining how he created the stunning images that accompany the Orange Fairy Book, illustrator and children's author Tomislav Tomić said: 'Some books are easier to illustrate than other books and that was the case with Orange Fairy Book.

Unusual: A Tomić work from the Berber tale of the Clever Cat and a Nassef illustration from a French story

'I was very excited when this project started to happen - working on a book that reminds me of the books from the Golden Age of  Illustration in Europe was like a dream coming true.

'Fairytales are my favourite type of stories to illustrate because it is always easy to find some interesting scenes to draw.'

Among his work is a delicately rendered scene from Danish author Hans Christian Andersen's classic tale of the Ugly Duckling.

Others accompany less well-known tales, translated from numerous languages, among them Gaelic, Cherokee, Catalan and Icelandic.

Some of the more unusual stories include How Ian Direach got the Blue Falcon, a story that hails from the Scottish Highlands, and a Berber yarn entitled The Clever Cat.

Particularly striking is The White Slipper, a Spanish story that reverses the Cinderella story and features a king who loses his precious white shoe and offers his 
daughter’s hand to whoever finds it.

The Grey and Orange Fairy Books, £44.95 each, are published by The Folio Society
