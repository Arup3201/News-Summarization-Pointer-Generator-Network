A former police officer, previously awarded the Cross of Valour for bravery, has risked his life again by jumping onto train tracks at Sydney's Redfern station to save a man who'd tumbled into the path of a train.

In shocking CCTV footage from the platform, Allan Sparkes, 56, can be seen dashing to the rescue of another man who had fallen onto the tracks just seconds before a train rolled into the busy station.

'If nobody had gone down and got that chap off the platform, the train would have hit him and killed him,' said a calm Mr Sparkes.

Hero: Former police officer Allan Sparkes didn't think twice about jumping down onto the tracks at Redfern station in Sydney to save another man

More commuters rushed to help pull them both to safety just in time, when the incident occured on Sunday, April 27.

'I looked over and saw the chap inside there and that's when I decided to get down as quick as I could,' he explained to Nine News.

Sydney Trains directions of operations, Tony Eid, said: 'We recognise the bravery of the gentleman who jumped down and saved this guy's life.'

It's not the first time Mr Sparkes,who lives in Sydney's inner west, has been hailed a hero. He was awarded the Cross of Valour for bravery after rescuing an 11-year-old boy in Coffs Harbour.

On May 3, 1996, the then-officer with New South Wales Police was called to rescue a boy trapped in a flooded underground storm water drain following record rainfalls at Coffs Harbour.

Mr Sparkes tied a rope around himself and entered the drain, where he was washed 20 metres along the pipe by the ferocious current.

After the first attempt failed he tried again and says he almost drowned as he was washed 80 metres away from where he entered.

But after a desperate search he finally made contact with the boy 30 metres from the pipe opening, coaxing him to let go of the debris he was clinging to so that he could be saved.

'I thought "you better hurry up and get out of here quick smart",' he joked at the time.

Lucky escape: Less than a minute later a train rolled in to the platform

No regrets: The former police officer suggested he would do it again if someone needed his help

Mr Sparkes now works as a motivational speaker. He left the police force after 20 years as a frontline officer due to the cumulative effects of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic depression.

He went on to write a book called The Cost of Bravery, which revealed how that first rescue sparked a downward spiral for his mental health.

But Mr Sparkes had no doubts about rescuing the man on the train tracks this week.
