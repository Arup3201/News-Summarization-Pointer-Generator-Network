An antiques collector who sold a Chinese bowl may have lost out on £150,000 after forgetting he had another that would have made a lucrative pair.

Tony Evans and his family were thrilled when his antique 'rice' bowl from the 18th century fetched a staggering £235,000 at auction.

But it wasn't until after the sale that the family remembered a matching piece Mr Evans had given to son Simon 30 years ago.

Tony Evans sold an antique rice bowl for £235,000 but had it been offered as a pair with another bowl he owned (pictured) experts believe the value would have increased by a third to nearer £650,000

The second bowl is now set to command a
similar price when it sells as a single lot, making a total of nearly 
£470,000 for the pair.

But experts believe that had the items been offered together they could have fetched over £600,000.

Mr
Evans, from Kent, had inherited the two Imperial porcelain bowls from 
his father Fred who had brought them back from working in China in the 
1920s.

The extremely rare 
bowls are six inches in diameter, are decorated with pheasants and were 
made for the Chinese Emperor Kangxi in the 1720s.

Simon
Evans, a 55-year-old chartered surveyor, had no idea what his bowl was 
when given it and has stored it in a box in the back of a cupboard for 
three decades.

Mr Evans, from East Anglia, said: ‘My jaw hit the floor when I found out my father's bowl sold for a six-figure sum.

‘A few days after the sale he suddenly announced that he thought there might have been a pair of them.

‘He had completely forgotten about giving it to me and I had also forgotten about receiving it.

‘It was my wife, Clare, who said 'oh 
yes, we do have a Chinese bowl in a box' that prompted us to get it out 
and low and behold there was the twin of the first bowl.

‘I had just put it in a cupboard for safekeeping and simply forgot about it.

‘I've decided to sell it not because I need the money but because I'm anxious about having something so valuable in the house.

‘It
is easy to wonder with the benefit of hindsight just how much a pair 
would have been worth had we sold them together. A pair being sold 
together must be extremely rare.

‘But it seems rather pointless to think like that now because it has been and gone.’

The
first pheasant bowl was sold last year by the Canterbury Auction 
Galleries in Kent that had put a pre-sale estimate of £8,000 to £12,000 
on it.

But because the 
market for Oriental antiques is booming at the moment due to the 
newly-rich Chinese buying back their heritage, bidding on it took off.

It
eventually went to an anonymous Chinese buyer, who saw off 11 other 
rival bidders to net it for £195,000. With the fees added on he would 
have paid £235,000.

The same auction house is now selling the second bowl. Although the estimate is £150,000 there is no reason why it will not sell for a similar price.

Tony Evans' father started collecting Oriental porcelain in 1925 during the time he worked for an Anglo/Chinese mining company in the port of Tientsin near Beijing.

His son, now aged in his 80s, began his own collection in the 1960s and 1970s from top London dealers.

Alastair Gibson, an expert of Chinese porcelain and consultant to the Canterbury Auction Galleries, said: ‘We obviously didn't know about the existence of the second bowl.

‘After the first sold for the significantly high price the vendor popped up and said he might have had a twin to that bowl.

‘Had we known it would have been nice to have the two bowls together in a single sale. Sadly, we didn't know.’

The auction for the second bowl takes place on April 16-17.

A traditional chinese 'Phoenix' marriage bowl has sold for a whopping £260,000 at auction.

The Chinese masterpiece would have been brought by the bride as part of her dowry to marriage.

It 
fetched £10,000 above the estimated price at auction at Chorley's in 
Cheltenham, Gloscestershire, and sold to a mystery Chinese collector.

The rare jade marriage bowl, which dates back to the 19th century, is 
from a collection of the late Commander Paul Bridgeman of Dowdeswell 
Manor, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

The bowl's ring handles, suspended from auspicious phoenix masks are typical of the form and the jade is of a pale celadon colour prized by the carvers of that era

Family members have passed it down over the years and the item was eventually handed to Chorley's auctioneers.

The
jade bowl, thought to be around 270 years old, is a type which was 
popular at the Imperial Qing court, the last imperial dynasty of China.

It would have been brought with a quantity of gifts including 
gold and porcelain, with jade being one of the most important of these 
gifts.

Its ring handles, suspended from auspicious phoenix masks are typical of the form and the 
jade is of a pale celadon colour prized by the carvers of that era.

The phoenix birds on the handles of this bowl are emblematic of new 
beginnings or rebirth which is why it would have been given as a gift
from the bride's family to her new husband.

John 
Harvey, director of Chorley's, said: ‘We were delighted to be able to 
offer this magnificent bowl for sale today and were very pleased with 
the huge amount of international interest the bowl generated.

‘It will now be returning to China.’
