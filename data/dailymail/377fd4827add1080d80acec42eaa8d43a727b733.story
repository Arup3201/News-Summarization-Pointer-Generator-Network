Former Prime Minister Tony Blair looks enthralled as he listens to Hollywood heartthrob Antonio Banderas.

The pair were watching a special Easter parade in Malaga and seemed to onlookers to be getting on famously from the balcony of the Larios Hotel in Malaga where rooms cost between £130 and £160 a night.

A banner hanging from the balcony featured the words 'Room Mate' which looked appropriate as the former Prime Minister and Mr Banderas looked like they had known each other for years.

The Easter break in Malaga is the first 
time the Blairs have been photographed together in public since Nelson 
Mandela's memorial service in December.

He and Cherie have been married since 1980 and have four children; Euan, 30, Nicky, 28, Kathryn, 26, and Leo, 13.

The Blair's Spanish break comes two years after they last visited the Costa del Sol. In 2012 the couple were pictured visiting a friend's house in Benahavis near Marbella.

The holiday is the latest stop in Mr Blair's busy schedule, as he travels the world in his new roles as business consultant and public speaker.

In the last year he has been seen disembarking from a £30million private jet at in Bangkok, Sardinia and New York state, and the top-of-the-range Bombardier Global Express private jet has also been seen in Switzerland, Ukraine and Israel on dates which matched Mr Blair’s visits.

Mr Blair's eldest son Euan is believed to be considering a future in parliament. It is believed that he could be installed as a candidate in a safe Labour seat to ensure he is successful at his first attempt.
