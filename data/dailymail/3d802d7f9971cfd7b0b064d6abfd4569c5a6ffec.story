A woman accused of arranging to send £16,000 to her husband fighting in Syria concealed in her friend's underwear is 'foul-mouthed' and a 'phone-addicted, weed-smoking kaffir' and an unlikely terrorist, her barrister has told a court.

Amal El-Wahabi, 27, of north west London, allegedly asked her friend Nawal Msaad, also 27, to be a trusted courier and take the cash to Turkey at the request of Aine Davis, known by his Muslim name Hamza.

But Msaad, of Holloway, north London, was stopped by police at Heathrow in January before she boarded a flight. She handed over the rolled up notes hidden in her undergarments, the Old Bailey heard.

'A foul-mouthed, red-haired, talkaholic, opinionated, phone-addicted, weed-smoking kaffir': A lawyer's description of his client Amal El-Wahabi (left) , who is accused of funding terrorism after arranging to send £16,000 to her husband fighting in Syria concealed in the underwear of her friend, Nawal Msaad (right)

Delivering his closing speech today, El-Wahabi's barrister Mark Summers described his client to jurors.

'A more unlikely terrorist you may never have seen in this court,' he said.

'Just picture this - Amal, that foul-mouthed, red-haired, talkaholic, opinionated, phone-addicted, weed-smoking kaffir playing the dutiful Burka-clad (woman) cooking around the camp fire in Syria.

'If a jury in this court in its 200 years has been invited to swallow a more preposterous proposition, I personally would have paid good money to see it.'

El-Wahabi put her hand over her mouth as she laughed at his comments from the dock.

Mr Summers went on: 'Added to these unsuitable jihadist personality traits is selfishness. Everything that Amal says and does is about her. She wouldn't even attend a charity event if she couldn't get in free.'

Courier: Msaad was stopped by police at Heathrow in January before she boarded a flight. She handed over the rolled up notes hidden in her undergarments, the Old Bailey (pictured) heard.

He also said that Hamza, 30, who the court previously heard was a drug dealer who was regularly in trouble with police, was involved in 'drugs, drugs and more drugs'.

Mr Summers told the jury of five men and seven women it would need to answer two questions as it deliberated its verdicts, the first being whether Hamza is a terrorist.

'If you're not sure that he's a terrorist, then it follows that you can't be sure that the money was for terrorism,' he said.

'Two: even if you answer question one in the affirmative you also have to be sure that Amal knew he was a terrorist. If she did not then it follows that she could not have believed that the money was for terrorism.

'Even if Davis (AKA Hamza) was a terrorist and Amal knew it, it still does not inevitably follow that terrorism was the target for the money.'

Mr Summers said El-Wahabi 'clearly was intending' to take her two young children to live in Turkey and that was what the money was to go towards.

'That's what she was telling people at the time,' he said.

'She hasn't made it up - it's there in her messages.'

El-Wahabi and Msaad both deny a charge of funding terrorism.
