Sale are confident that they can convince Danny Cipriani to agree a new deal as the prospects of the fly-half moving on appear to be receding, at least for now.

The 27-year-old England No 10 contender is out of contract at the end of this season and he will be free to officially negotiate with other clubs from January 1.

It has long been assumed that he craves a return to his roots in London, but it is understood  Cipriani is happy in Manchester and is keen to stay with the Sharks if they can recruit well to enhance their hopes of becoming play-off challengers in the Aviva Premiership.

Danny Cipriani could sign a new deal with Sale Sharks in the coming weeks

The Sale No 10 is preparing to take on Saracens in the European Champions Cup clash on Saturday

Earlier this year he was linked with a return to former club Wasps but that door has now closed. They are preparing for a fresh start in Coventry and Sportsmail has learned that ex-Newcastle stand-off Jimmy Gopperth has agreed a move to the Ricoh Arena next summer from Leinster - coinciding with Jonathan Sexton’s return to Dublin from Racing Metro.

While Wasps have relocated to the Midlands, Harlequins remain a prominent fixture in London but they will have former All Blacks fly-half Nick Evans for another season, while Ben Botica is well regarded - and well paid - as his understudy.

In time, a switch to The Stoop may be an appealing proposition for Cipriani, but for now Quins’ transfer-market priorities may be in other areas.

Elsewhere in the South East, Saracens have Owen Farrell as an established, long-term playmaker and London Irish do not have the title-chasing status that Cipriani craves.

Gloucester are the other club who have been mentioned as potential suitors, but they have James Hook, while Billy Burns is a rising talent and both Billy Twelvetrees and Greig Laidlaw can operate at No 10.

It is understood that, with England selection such a focus for him, Cipriani is not tempted by the notion of moving to France, where he could earn vast sums at a rich Top 14 club. 

Instead, there is a chance that he may agree a one-year extension at Sale, with a view to considering their signings and outlook after the World Cup, once the market settles down.

Cipriani impressed for England during the summer tour of New Zealand and  is looking to force his way back in

Asked about the progress of negotiations, Sale’s director of rugby Steve Diamond said: ‘We’ve had a chat and we’ll be taking the chat further. I’ll go for a beer with him, discuss it and when the time is right he will agree or he won’t agree. It won’t come down to pounds, shillings and pence; it will come down to our ambitions as a club.

‘We’re targeting two or three very good players. Two of them, we are meeting again this week – non-Premiership players. Danny is enjoying himself up here and if I can match his ambition with a couple of signings, I don’t see it as a problem.

‘The hunch at the moment is that he is dead happy here and we’ll carry on the conversation in the next week or so. At the end of the win against Harlequins, the camera zoomed in on Danny and he didn’t look like a lad who is rushing to get to another club.’

Cipriani insisted that for now, his primary focus is on maintaining his impressive recent form. But when the time comes to make a decision about his future, it will come down to the quest for titles and trophies.

‘There’s no rush for me at the moment,’ he said. ‘You saw last year when there was all the speculation about Freddie (Burns - before move from Gloucester to Leicester) and that was difficult. If the club shows ambition and signs certain players, that’s what I want to see and shows we’re going in the right direction.

‘People all say we are fighting above ourselves, but if we add some class to that then the boys will start believing that top four is realistic. I don’t play rugby to make up the numbers; I want to be in the play-off games, that is my main focus. That is going to help my international ambitions and I’m not going to stop having them.

‘I’m not eager to get a move, I just want to make sure the team shows the right ambition then it is somewhere I would want to stay. You do grow fond of a place, but play-off rugby is what I want to be involved in.’ 

Owen Farrell is at Saracens so that is not an option for Cipriani in the South East
