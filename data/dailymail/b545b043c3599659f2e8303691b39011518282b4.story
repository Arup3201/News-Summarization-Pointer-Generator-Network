A record number of children are now being treated for cannabis addiction, according to latest figures.

More than 13,500 youngsters under the age of 18 were sent for medical treatment last year. 

That is a 50 per cent rise in seven years and includes 200 children aged 12 or below. 

Experts are blaming the popularity of a new super-strength skunk which is several times more potent than regular pot.

It has also be linked to an increase in mental illness. 

Treatment for the 13,581 young addicts averaged 150 days and focuses on counselling and support.

Andrew Brown, director of policy at drug information charity DrugScope, said: 'Of course it’s worrying when a child or young adult is using any drug, including cannabis. 

'But government research shows that getting young people the help they need early brings benefits to both the individual and the community. 

'Every pound spent on treatment for under-18s saves two, reducing the costs of crime and health problems within just two years. 

'Unfortunately, drug and alcohol services for young people have seen funding reductions of up to 20 per cent over the last few years – which DrugScope fears is a false economy.'

The statistics have been compiled by Public Health England. 

Cannabis is the most widely-used illegal drug in Britain although the numbers of people using it are falling, according to the charity FRANK. 

The main active chemical in it is tetrahydrocannabinol (or THC for short).

THC is the ingredient in cannabis that can make you feel very chilled out, happy and relaxed.

Last month Nick Clegg backed a report which suggests governments should consider the legalisation of cannabis.

The Deputy Prime Minister signed a foreword to a study which backs a programme of ‘rigorously monitored’ regulation of illegal drugs.

He endorsed the paper, which condemned the war on drugs as a costly failure and recommended ‘smarter’ drug laws.It said countries should be encouraged to conduct experiments in legalising cannabis, as long as they kept the price of the drug high and controlled its use by rationing.

The Home Office has protested that over the past decade cannabis use has been sharply down, indicating that the drug laws and official disapproval of cannabis are working.

In the US, the state of Colorado allowed cannabis to go on sale at the start of the year at two dozen shops.

State residents aged 21 and over are permitted to buy an ounce, and visitors a quarter ounce.
