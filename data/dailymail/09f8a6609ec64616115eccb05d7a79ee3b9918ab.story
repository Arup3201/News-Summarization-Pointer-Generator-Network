Squirming in his seat, promising to be good and telling his father how much he loves him, Charlie Corbett is the picture of a well-behaved child.

But the four-year-old is the victim of a white lie, believing his dad Jonny has installed an ejector seat and can use a red 'SOS' button in his BMW to fire him into space.

A video of their exchange has become a hit online as Charlie tries desperately not to be naughty on a trip to the supermarket with his mother Bethany, 31, and 18-month-old sister  Annabelle.

Prank: A video of four-year-old Charlie Corbett fearing his father will fire him into space has become an internet hit 

On the button: Father Jonny Corbett films himself threatening to press this button in his BMW with son Charlie yelling: 'No, no, no, don't press it. No, Daddy'

Mr Corbett, 28, films himself hovering his finger over a red button - designed for a driver to send out an alert in the event of an accident - but tells his son it would fire him in to space.

He says: 'Charlie, can you see the button? Can you tell me what it does?', to which his son  replies: 'I go into space.'

The little boy then shouts: 'No, no, no, don't press it. No, Daddy, no. Just close it up.'

In a sweet assurance to his father he says: 'Daddy, if I tell you I love you and I kiss you and I want to play with you, that means I never go into space.'

Corporate salesman Mr Corbett, of York, said: 'We've been having fun with the ejector seat button for as long as we can remember.

Well behaved: Mr Corbett says the game has become a great way to keep his son in check when he is bored on a car journey

Defence: The proud father says of his video: 'I'm really not that mean to Charlie. We're just having fun'

'I now reveal the button if Charlie gets a bit twitchy when he's sat bored strapped in the car.

'I often video us doing things and thought Charlie looked really funny. It was only when I uploaded it to Facebook that I was astounded by how many people started liking it.

'It is a funny video. I'm really not that mean to Charlie. We're just having fun.'

The button is a new addition to the latest BMW models and allows a driver to send out an alert in the event of an accident. 

According to BMW: 'Your location is automatically transmitted to the emergency or the breakdown service so that the right help arrives on the scene faster'.
