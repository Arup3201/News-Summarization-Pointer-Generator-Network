Britain's baffling tax system should be radically simplified to help pensioners, the Government's tax advisers said yesterday

Britain's baffling tax system should be radically simplified to help pensioners, the Government’s tax  advisers said yesterday.

The Office of Tax Simplification wants older people to receive a colour-coded letter each year that will clearly explain all their tax codes, in a victory for a long-running Money Mail campaign.

The OTS slammed the current system that bombards pensioners with different tax codes, leaving them unsure how much tax they should pay.

The codes, which consist of a series of letters and numbers that few people except accountants understand, dictate how much money one can receive before paying tax.

As a result, many get a nasty shock when they open a letter from HM Revenue and Customs demanding taxes they did not know they owed.

The OTS’s report, published yesterday after an 18-month investigation, said it is wrong that retirement for many pensioners means a move from ‘simple to complex’ tax affairs.

It follows a long- running Money Mail campaign to make the tax system easier for pensioners to navigate.

Many people are never responsible for their tax affairs when they were working, under the pay-as-you-earn system.

As a result, when they retire they are often overwhelmed by HMRC sending them different tax codes for each source of income, such as their pensions and interest from savings.

The OTS has now proposed a new ‘Form P2C’ letter for pensioners, which would ‘outline the code for each source of income’ that will apply to the following tax year.

Its report states: ‘This would enable pensioners to check more easily that their tax affairs were correct and would reduce the anxiety of receiving multiple [tax code] notices without a clear understanding of how they are connected.’

It is also calling for a new ‘DWP60’ form to be sent every April, which would explain how much pensioners should have been taxed on their income in the previous tax year.

In a controversial move, it has also proposed that the 10 per cent savings rate, which allows people to pay lower tax on savings income of up to £2,710 a year, should be scrapped.

The OTS says it should be removed because ‘awareness and claim levels are so low that it is ineffective in incentivising savings’ – but HMRC figures show around 525,000 people, including many pensioners, claim the rebate, worth about £90 a year.

The OTS called for the annual tax-free Isa limit, currently £11,280 for a share-based account, to be given a one-off increase to offset the impact of this change.

It has not proposed how big this should be, but Mike Warburton, of the OTS’s consulting committee, said there is a ‘good argument’ for a £5,000 rise.

The OTS was set up in July 2010, soon after the Coalition came to power. Its proposals must be approved by the Chancellor, who could announce his decision in the Budget in March.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘The Government is committed to simplifying the tax system and ensuring it is straightforward and easy to comply with.

We will respond to [the OTS’s] recommendations at the appropriate time.’

Tax for pensioners is a minefield. The gradual introduction of allowances, credits, tax breaks and new rates have made the system convoluted and complicated.

Every year, thousands are landed with shock bills because HMRC has failed to deduct the right amount of money from their income.

In 2011, Money Mail handed a dossier of complaints about the system to John Whiting, the top accountant who was appointed head of the Office of Tax Simplification.

This described how the retired were baffled that the state pension is taxable, but paid without tax being deducted.

There was also huge confusion over the 10p tax rate paid on up to £2,710 of savings interest. 

But by far the biggest problem stemmed from the reams of tax codes sent out by HMRC every year.

A typical pensioner may have two company pensions, the state pension, and income from savings; there will be different codes for each, which may change two or three times a year.

Workers who have spent their whole life in the PAYE system are suddenly expected to understand these, and know when they are wrong. It’s like learning a new language late in life. 

The proposal to clarify tax codes is a giant stride to making life easier. It will give pensioners a clearer picture of how much tax they are paying, and help to spot mistakes earlier.

It should also cut down on unexpected bills which many struggle to pay.

However, in calling for the end of the 10p rate of tax on savings income, the OTS is in danger of stripping away benefits from pensioners at a time when their incomes are already severely squeezed – as it did when it proposed the removal of higher tax-free allowances for the over-65s, a policy that became known as the ‘granny tax’.

The OTS says the 10p rate is too complex, and that the £50million it costs should be spent on higher Isa allowances for everyone.

However, 525,000 save an average of £90 a year because of the 10p rate. Scrapping it would mean taking cash from pensioners, and sharing it with everyone else. That is no reward for a lifetime spent saving.

Hopefully, the Chancellor will realise that on this occasion, simpler is not better, and reject another stealth tax hike on the prudent.
