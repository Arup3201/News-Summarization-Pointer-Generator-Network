Manager Tony Pulis praised Darren Fletcher's growing influence at West Brom after they moved clear of trouble.

The Baggies beat Stoke 1-0 on Saturday and are eight points above the Barclays Premier League relegation zone.

It was their fourth straight home win in all competitions and Pulis believes 31-year-old midfielder Fletcher, who joined from Manchester United in January, has been key to that success.

West Brom boss Tony Pulis has praised the growing influence of his captain Fletcher

'He's been a fantastic signing. He's a tremendous lad, his enthusiasm and energy levels are top class,' Pulis said.

'He looks as sprightly as any 20 year old. He and (James) Morrison dominated the midfield. They've played together for Scotland and a lot of good stuff came from those two.'

Brown Ideye scored his seventh goal of the season as the Baggies won their seventh game out of 13 under Pulis.

'We looked a good team,' said the Baggies boss. 'The one thing you have to do is make your home a fortress. The crowd was fantastic. The Stoke fans were good and our supporters rose to that and were fantastic. 

'That win was for the fans.'
