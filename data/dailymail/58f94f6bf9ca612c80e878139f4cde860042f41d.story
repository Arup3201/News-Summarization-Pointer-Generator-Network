Thousands of historic pre-war posters were seized on the orders of Hitler’s Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels in the summer of 1938; months later during the Kristallnacht program against Jews, the poster’s owner, Hans Sachs, was arrested and thrown into Sachsenhausen.

Though Sachs and his wife managed to secure British visas and eventually escape to the U.S., Hans Sachs never saw his beloved posters again, even after discovering that many of them existed behind what was then the Iron Curtain in Communist East Berlin.

Now, after a seven-year battle with the German museum that held them after the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hans Sachs’ son, Peter, has 4,300 of his father’s prized posters in his possession.

After searching in vain for a museum to house the priceless artifacts, the 75-year-old heir to his father's posters is selling them at auction, where they are expected to fetch $6million to $21million.

The 75-year-old, who lives in Las 
Vegas, is now auctioning off many of his father’s impressive collection 
of posters, which include one designed by Edvard Munch and another by 
Gustav Klimt.

Goebbels wanted the entire collection
for a museum; it was well-known that Hans Sachs had the most complete 
collection of posters, which he had started collecting in high school. 
Mr Sachs had an eventual total of 12,500 posters, many displayed in a 
specially built gallery in his home.

After the war, Hans Sachs assumed the
collection had been destroyed and accepted compensation of about 
225,000 German marks (then worth about $50,000) from West Germany in 
1961.

Five years later, he learned that 
part of the collection had survived the war and had been turned over to 
an East Berlin museum. It is not known what happened to the other 
posters.

Sachs wrote the communist authorities
about seeing the posters or even bringing an exhibit to the West to no 
avail. He died in 1974 without ever seeing them again.

The posters became part of the German Historical Museum's collection in 1990, after the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall.

Peter Sachs only learned of the existence of the collection in 2005, and began fighting then for their return.

Legal battles went all the way to 
Germany's top federal appeals court, which ruled last March in favor of 
Sachs, saying that if the museum kept the posters it would be akin to 
perpetuating the crimes of the Nazis.

Since being returned the posters 
Sachs has repaid the 1961 restitution payment, and said he was relieved 
that the ordeal was now over.

'I don't really feel a sense of 
victory as much as I do of vindication,' he said. 'I think it's absurd 
that this should have occurred in the first place; I think the museum 
simply should have relinquished them in the beginning on moral grounds.'

After the seven-year battle for their
return from a German museum, Peter Sachs told The Associated Press he 
hopes auctioning off the majority of the posters will mean they will 
finally be on display for those who love them like his father did, after
he failed to find a museum willing to take the whole collection on.

'There's of course no practical way 
that I could frame and hang 4,300 posters, so I just didn't see any 
other alternative than to do what we're doing,' Peter Sachs, 75, said by
telephone from his home in Las Vegas.

Haul: The collection will be auctioned on Friday, and is estimated to fetch millions of dollars

Assumption: After the war, Hans Sachs assumed the collection had been destroyed and accepted compensation of about 225,000 German marks (then worth about $50,000) from West Germany in 1961

'But
I don't feel guilty in any way whatsoever - even with them being 
auctioned I think it's far preferable that they will wind up in the 
hands of people who truly enjoy them and appreciate them rather than 
sitting in a museum's storage for another 70 years without seeing the 
light of day.'

years without seeing the light of day.'

The auction 
at Guernsey's in New York runs Friday through Sunday and features 1,233 
of the posters, including one designed by Edvard Munch to advertise an 
exhibit of his own works in Zurich in 1922, an 1898 poster by Austrian 
symbolist painter Gustav Klimt, and even James Montgomery Flagg's 1917 
famous 'Uncle Sam' recruiting poster 'I Want You For U.S. Army.'

They include advertisements for 
exhibitions, cabarets, movies and consumer products, as well as 
political propaganda - all rare, with only small original print runs. 
The value of the 4,300 poster collection is estimated at between $6 
million and $21 million.

There is no reserve price set for the
auction, but the individual posters being sold range in estimated value
from about $500 to $40,000, said Arlan Ettinger, president of 
Guernsey's. They date back to 1885, and many are the only known 
surviving copies, and are in excellent condition, Ettinger said.

'Posters
were created to be ephemeral, to be temporary things, to last an 
average of six weeks because they were designed to be posted up on a 
wall, whether it was to announce a show at a cabaret club or a political
event,' said Ettinger.

'That
we're even talking about things that are so fragile is miraculous, and 
despite the incredible journey these posters have been through ... in 
some cases they look as vibrant as the day they were printed; the colors
are so vivid.'

Two further auctions are envisioned 
for September and likely next January, but Sachs said he also plans to 
hold onto about 800 posters that he will donate to a museum or museums 
that show an interest in putting them on display for the public.

Right now the focus is Jewish museums, specifically with Holocaust related exhibits, though other establishments would also be considered, said Gary Osen, the New Jersey-based attorney who represented Sachs in his fight for the return of the posters from Berlin's German Historical Museum.

Osen said talks are also under way for a possible special exhibition of some of the posters at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp memorial - the former Nazi camp on the outskirts of Berlin where Sachs' father was briefly held before he fled Germany for the United States.

'The net result will be that a substantially larger number of the posters from this collection will be on public view than would have been had they remained in the German Historical Museum,' Osen said.

Sachs is also going to hold onto four of the posters for himself - including an advertisement for Manoli cigarettes by artist Lucian Bernhard.

He said it has special significance to him because Bernhard co-founded the art publication Das Plakat, or The Poster, with his father in 1910 and was a family friend.

'As a child I knew Lucian Bernhard. He used to come and visit at the house, so that one had a personal meaning to me,' he said.

Born in 1881, Hans Sachs began collecting posters while in high school. By 1905, he was Germany's leading private poster collector, with an eventual total of 12,500 posters - many displayed in a specially built gallery in his home.

The entire collection was seized in the summer of 1938 on the order of Goebbels, who wanted it for a museum, when Peter Sachs was a year old.
