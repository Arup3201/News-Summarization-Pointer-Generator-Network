Heartbroken: Becky Tait, 20, had died on a railway line where a close friend was fatally hit by a train

A heartbroken girlfriend killed herself by copying her boyfriend’s suicide just weeks after he threw himself in front of a train.

Care worker Becky Tait, 20, stepped in front of a speeding locomotive on Sunday evening after struggling to come to terms with the death of Phil James.

The 19-year-old had died two days after being hit by a train along the same stretch of tracks, near Stone station in Staffordshire, on September 7.

Shortly after his death, Miss Tait posted photographs on a Facebook tribute page of the couple on holiday in Portugal.

She wrote: ‘The best memories with the best person I’ve ever met. I love you so much.’

Yesterday friends told how Miss Tait had been left inconsolable following the death of her ‘soul mate’. 

On a Facebook page in her memory, they wrote that the pair had ‘found true love’.

One friend, who would give his name only as Adam, said: ‘They had known each other for a while but had only been going out for a couple of months.

‘She was inconsolable and I don’t think she coped well with the death at all.

‘Despite people trying to show their support she just shied away and went into her own little bubble. 

'She didn’t talk about it, which I don’t think helped. It’s a tragic loss of two good people.

‘It is so sad they both thought this was the only option out.’

More than 370 of Miss Tait’s friends have joined the Facebook page set up in her memory.

Tom Arnold, who created the tribute, wrote: ‘You were the single most incredible, lovable, funny, compassionate, brilliant, entertaining person … The reality of it set in today and I honestly don’t know what I’ll do without you.’

He added: ‘I know you’ve struggled for a long time now and I truly hope you’ve found peace.’ Miss Tait was pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene at around 6.15pm, just yards from where Mr James had been found fatally injured.

Stone's mayor said of the pair (pictured): 'The feelings of the community are very strong'

Police say they are not treating her death as suspicious.

In a statement, her family said: ‘Becky will be sadly missed by many people. Sadly Becky took her own life.

‘We would like to thank everyone for their kind wishes, support and floral tributes.’ 

A spokesman for New Park House care home, where Miss Tait had worked for the past three years, said: ‘Becky was a highly valued member of the team. She was bubbly, caring and would do anything for anyone.’

Mr James, also from Stone, was described as one of Robbie Williams’ biggest fans and had a tattoo of the pop star’s name across his chest. Following the teenager’s death, the singer left a tribute on Twitter, asking him to ‘save me a pint in heaven’.

Since the two deaths, cards and flowers have been left across the town in tribute.

Cathy Collier, mayor of Stone, said: ‘To take your own life is a terrible thing. No one knows what goes through someone’s mind when they do it.

‘The family must be going through heartbreak.

‘The feelings of the community are very strong, as they were with the previous death. It’s bad enough when someone older passes away but for someone so young it’s such a waste of a life.’

Miss Tait last month attended a rugby match held at Stone Rugby Club to raise money for a memorial bench for her boyfriend at Stone Cemetery.
