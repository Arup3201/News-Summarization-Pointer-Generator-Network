Around one pedestrian in seven injured on the roads is drunk at the time, according to research.

It also reveals the run-up to Christmas is a peak period for accidents involving ‘drunk walkers’. 

Some 14 per cent of those involved in a road accident while on foot over the past three years were ‘walking under the influence’ of alcohol after a night on the tiles, it says.

New research suggests around one pedestrian in seven injured during accidents on the roads is drunk

Figures from the Department of Transport reveal more than 6,000 intoxicated pedestrians have been injured since 2011.

They are also posing a problem for thousands of innocent motorists as their unpredictable and often dangerous behaviour – from drunkenly crossing roads without looking or simply staggering onto a road and into the path of an oncoming car - increases the risk of a crash.

Nearly a third of drivers say they have had to swerve or brake in order to avoid hitting a drunk pedestrian, with one in eight admitting to hitting one.

The AA said some drunk pedestrians have been killed lying unseen in the gutter when street lights have been switched off to cut osts.

The report based on Freedom of Information data from 21 police forces and statistics from the Transport Department reveals that men account for more than three quarters, or 79 per cent, of all drunk pedestrian road incidents, with those under the age of 25 involved in more incidents than any other age group.

Drunk pedestrians are more at risk of injury on UK roads at night between the times of 10pm and midnight - close to pub and bar closing times and ‘perhaps as a result of a long night of drinking,’ says the dossier.

A report by insurers Confused.com says: ‘Over 6,000 ‘drunk’ pedestrians have been injured on UK roads since 2011 - and many of these ‘drunk walking’ accidents are happening over the Christmas period.’ 

It says nearly a third of all drunken pedestrian incidents involved people between the ages of 18 to 24 and says this suggests ‘that the young are not taking enough care on the roads after consuming alcohol’.

Separate research found that 83 per cent of people admit having walked home while under the influence of alcohol, with just over one in five, or 21 per cent, admitting they consumed eight drinks or more on a night out.

A third of drunk pedestrians  admitted to having walked down roads which were unlit; with nearly two thirds, 62 per cent, confessing that they have walked home alone when under the influence of alcohol, according to findings from 2,000 people questioned by One Poll Research.

One in seven admitted to crossing roads without looking properly while drunk and a similar proportion said they have sat down on the side of the road when intoxicated. 

A worrying one in 10 confessed to having fallen into a road when drunk. 

Drunken walkers are also putting motorists at risk, with nearly a third of drivers saying they had to swerve or brake in order to avoid hitting a pedestrian they suspected of being intoxicated.

About one in eight admitted to having actually knocked into a pedestrian that they believed to be drunk. 

Figures show the run-up to Christmas is a peak period for accidents involving ‘drunk walkers’

However more than a fifth of motorists say they would either stop their car or call the police if they saw a drunken person staggering in the road.

Across the country last year the Metropolitan Police recorded 158 ‘drunk walk’ injuries, Kent police recorded 123 injuries, Glasgow City Council: 126 injuries, and Northern Ireland 64. 

Scotland has this month lowered the legal drink-drive limit from 80mgs – where it remains in the rest of the UK - to 50mgs per 100ml of blood.

AA spokesman Paul Watters said: ’Sadly these statistics do not surprise us. We have had reports of pedestrians lying in the gutter and being killed because coroners said drivers did not see them. Cut backs on street lights play a part.

‘Sometimes drunks use main roads and even motorways to walk home because it’s the way they now from driving. Then they tumble into the road and there’s a tragedy.’

Gemma Stanbury, head of motor Insurance at Confused.com, said: ’There is already much being done to raise awareness around the dangers of drink driving, but it is the responsibility of all road users – both motorists and pedestrians - to act responsibly when near or on the roads. 

'Nobody wants to see anyone involved in a road accident, especially over the Christmas period. 

'However the reality is that more people are out consuming alcohol over the festive season, leading to an unfortunate increase in the number of pedestrian casualties.'

Breath test data shows that in 2013, 3 per cent of drivers and riders failed a breath test following a reported personal injury accident.

Drink drive casualty estimates for 2012 show that there were 230 drink drive deaths in 2012. 

There were 1,430 drink drive killed or seriously injured casualties (KSIs) in 2012. 

In that same year about 6 per cent of killed motorcyclists and around a quarter of vehicle drivers were found to be over the legal alcohol limit when they died.
