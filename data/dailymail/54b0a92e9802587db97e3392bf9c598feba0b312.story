'There's pot and there's pot': Bill Clinton said that the decision on whether or not to legalise marijuana should be left to individual states

Bill Clinton says individual states should decide whether to legalise pot without interference from the federal government.

The former president, who famously said he smoked the drug but 'didn't inhale', said he thought there was 'a lot of evidence to argue for the medicinal marijuana thing'.

But he added there were 'unresolved questions' and it was up to states to to decide whether legalisation was in the public interest.

His remarks on medicinal marijuana 
appeared to contradict comments made by his wife, Hillary - the former 
secretary of state who is now mooted as a future Democrat presidential 
candidate - earlier this month.

'I
 think we should leave it to the states,' said Mr Clinton in an 
interview with NBC's David Gregory, recorded in Colorado - where weed is
 legal - and broadcast yesterday.

'This really is a time when there should be laboratories of democracy, because nobody really knows where this is going.

'Are
 there adequate quality controls? There's pot and there's pot; what's in
 it? What's going to happen? There are all these questions.'

Federal
 law currently classifies marijuana as a Schedule 1 drug - the most 
dangerous kind - but both Colorado and Washington have nevertheless 
legalised it for recreational use.

A
 further 22 states and the District of Columbia have either legalised 
weed for medicinal use or decriminalised its possession, or both.

Clinton's
 opinion chimes with America's changing attitudes towards the use of 
marijuana. A Pew Research Center poll conducted last year found 52 per 
cent backed legalisation, against 45 per cent who do not.

The
 UN Office on Drugs and Crime estimates one in eight Americans smokes 
dope regularly, far more than the UK, where just more than one in 20 
uses the drug, and even Jamaica, where nearly 10 per cent smoke it.

Mr Clinton added: 'I like where it is now. If the state wants to try it, they can. And then they will be able to see what happens.'

Last month Mrs Clinton told a CNN 'Town Hall' event that there weren't enough facts to decide on whether marijuana could be an effective medicine.

'I don’t think we’ve done enough research yet,' she said. 'Although I think for people who are in extreme medical conditions and have anecdotal evidence that it works, there should be availability under appropriate circumstances.

'But I do think we need more research, because we don't know how it interacts with other drugs.'

A spokesman from the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws - a pro-legalisation group - welcomed Mr Clinton's comments and hoped his wife would follow his stance.

The spokesman said: 'President Clinton's comments illustrate just how far the issue of marijuana legalization has come since the 1990s.

'During his tenure in office, Bill Clinton oversaw one of the largest increases of America's prison population in U.S. history - one largely fuelled by drug arrests - and also lead a rather severe crackdown on states that were moving towards implementation of medical marijuana programs.

'His embrace of federalism on this issue is a welcome evolution and denotes the power overwhelming public support, and the political pressure that comes with it, has on the topic of marijuana law reform.

'Hopefully this signifies the type of rhetoric we will also see coming from a Hillary Clinton presidential campaign.'

MailOnline contacted the Women's Christian Temperance Union for the opposing view, but has not yet received a reply.
