The two-mile wide tornado which tore through the suburbs of Oklahoma City on Monday left devastation reminiscent of a war zone as it leveled entire streets and buildings killing at least 24 people.

At 2 miles wide, it cut an unusually wide swathe of destruction as it carved through Moore, Oklahoma.

The storm destroyed or damaged at least 1,200 homes and caused an estimated $2 billion in damages which may make the May 20 twister the most expensive to ever strike the U.S.

These satellite pictures reveal the total destruction along the twister's 20 mile long path of destruction.

A
series of striking before and after satellite images posted at Google's
Crisis Center underscores the raw power of the tornado that tore 
through the Oklahoma City suburb.

What is most striking about the pictures is how random the damage appears to be.

Some streets were all but wiped off the map, yet neighbouring roads appear unharmed.

In many instanced, whether you survived or died depended on luck, and the whim of the tornado - a sobering reminder of Mother Nature's fury.

An area centered around Southeast Sixth and Whispering Oaks streets. The path of the EF-5 tornado can be clearly seen.

Moore Medical Center, the only hospital in Moore, sustained major damage and was evacuating all its patients to other hospitals.

The National Weather Service assigned the twister a ranking EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale, making it the most powerful category of tornado with winds over 200 mph.

Witnesses said Monday's tornado was more fierce than the giant twister that tore up the area on May 3, 1999, killing more than 40 people and destroying thousands of homes.

Plaza Towers Elementary School was pulverized along with Moore Medical Center as the tornado winds reached upwards of 200 mph.

Moore is more densely populated than 
most towns in Tornado Alley, which is why so much property and so many 
people were in harm’s way when the tornado touched down.

Entire streets are all but wiped off the map, and the debris on the ground is visible even from space.

South Telephone Road in Moore, Oklahoma:  Oklahoma City Mayor Mick Cornett said more than 33,000 people have been affected with nearly 13,000 homes impacted. President Barack Obama is expected to visit tornado-ravaged areas of Oklahoma on Sunday and thank volunteers and first-responders for their efforts.

The area around Briarwood Elementary School : So many of the school teachers in Moore are being hailed as heroes. As the tornado bore down on them, they did everything they could to save their students

Damage at Briarwood Elementary School, the school that was the focus of so much attention during the storm coverage:

The tornado completely demolished Plaza Towers Elementary School seen here in the centre of the pictures. Seven children were killed on the school's grounds. Miraculously, several students were pulled out from the rubble alive.

Take a look at Google's map to see the damage for yourself...
