Leicester hooker Tom Youngs is the latest player to be ruled out of England’s tour of New Zealand, in order to be with his wife while she is being treated for a serious illness.

The 27-year-old will be left out of a 40-man squad to be named later this month and head coach Stuart Lancaster said: ‘Our thoughts are with Tom and Tiffany at this time and it is entirely right that he stays at home to support her and their daughter Maisie.’

While Youngs has been stood down on compassionate grounds, the management have ruled Alex Corbisiero, Tom Croft and Christian Wade out of their disintegrating plans on fitness grounds, even though the first two are set to make comebacks this weekend.

Boost: England coach Stuart Lancaster is sweating over several player injuries

‘Alex and Tom have worked really hard to come back before the end of the season but they will not have played enough rugby to be considered,’ said Lancaster. ‘It’s the same with Christian Wade.’

The removal of Youngs, along with the serious knee injury suffered by Bath’s Rob Webber and David Paice’s recent lay-off from London Irish duties, has created a significant problem at hooker.

The country’s first-choice No 2, Dylan Hartley, has been recovering from a shoulder injury sustained in March. Northampton are still uncertain whether their captain will return to action this weekend or next. And if the Saints reach the Aviva Premiership final, Hartley will not be available for England’s first Test against the All Blacks in Auckland on June 7. That game is increasingly likely to feature a team decimated by the loss of several key players, due to the fixture congestion which means it is taking place seven days after the showpiece culmination of the domestic season.

Lancaster will be forced to field a savagely weakened line-up, including a fifth or sixth-choice hooker. Dave Ward of Harlequins may find himself pitched into a Test debut against the world champions in the hostile surroundings of Eden Park. The 28-year-old spent three years at Cornish Pirates in the Championship, but he is now poised for an international call. Another contender would be Exeter’s highly-rated rookie, Luke Cowan-Dickie.

England are preparing to be without Billy Twelvetrees for the Auckland match, after he went off with a damaged ankle last weekend. But the 25-year-old may still be selected in the hope that he can be fit for the later Tests in Dunedin and Hamilton.

Midfield is another problem, with any two of Manu Tuilagi, Luther Burrell and Brad Barritt destined to be involved in the Premiership final. Other concerns are tighthead prop – where David Wilson is the only properly established figure – and fly half. With Owen Farrell, George Ford and Stephen Myler all potential finalists on May 31, Danny Cipriani could play against the Barbarians at Twickenham the following day, before joining the senior tour.
