It may be cold outside but these red pandas made the most of their fur coats and enjoyed a play fight in the snow.

The creatures were snapped rolling around in the grounds of a Vienna zoo as they showed off their strength and speed in the friendly tussle.

In scenes similar to the martial arts DreamWorks animation Kung Fu Panda, the male and female red pandas dodged and pounced as they each tried to outwit their opponent.

Paws up, but the fight isn't over yet for these two

The red pandas grappled in a play fight for quite some time, aided by the occasional break for a bamboo snack

The sparring partners were spotted by Austrian photographer, Josef Gelernter.

The 31-year-old watched as the fight unfolded at the Tiergarten Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna - the world's oldest zoo, having been open in the grounds of the summer palace for 251 years.

Mr Gelernter said he could have watched the red pandas for hours.

The father-of-two said: 'It was as though the snow had stimulated their urge to play, just like children really.

'They were very lively and even had to take breaks in between to regain their strength.

'They took some time out to eat carrots and bamboo and then starting fighting all over again.'

Like Master Shifu, the kung fu warrior in the Dreamworks film, the male and female red pandas showed off their speed and strength as they wrestled in the snow.

'They were moving really quickly so it was quite difficult to capture but I think I managed to get some nice shots,' said Mr Gelernter.

The snow covering the Tiergarten Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna seemed to bring out the pandas' playful side, said photographer Josef Gelernter

After about five or six tussles, the pandas, one male and one female, needed a nap to recover

But even the most ferocious fighter has to give in to tiredness at some point.

'The pandas repeated this about five or six times before exhausting themselves and falling asleep,' said Mr Gelernter.

'The male panda wanted to carry on playing but the female was clearly very tired so he gave up in the end.

'It was such a joy watching them play, the snow seemed to really bring out the life in them.

'It was simply amazing, I could have watched them for hours. They looked so cute.'

Unlike their distant cousins, giant pandas, red pandas are not much bigger than a domestic cat.

They are usually quite shy, but these two were snapped during mating season - usually January to March - when the creatures are more willing to socialise.
