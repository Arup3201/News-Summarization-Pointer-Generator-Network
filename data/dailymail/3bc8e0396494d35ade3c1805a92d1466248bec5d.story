Six Americans were killed this morning in a suicide bomb attack targeting NATO workers in Kabul, according to Afghan and foreign officials.

Their identity has not yet been released - at least fifteen people died in one of the worst attacks in the Afghan capital in months.

The brazen attack made May the deadliest month this year for coalition forces.

Cmdr. Bill Speaks, a spokesman for the U.S. Defense Secretary, confirmed that the two soldiers from the NATO military coalition who were killed in the bombing were Americans.

He would not comment on the nationalities of the civilian contractor.

Reports: Six Americans were killed this morning in a suicide bomb attack targeting NATO workers in Kabul, according to Afghan and foreign officials

A suicide car bomb targeting foreign military vehicles exploded in the Afghan capital Kabul shortly after 8:00 am (0330 GMT), police said

Wounded: Forty people were wounded in the blast at around 8 a.m. (0330 GMT) during the morning rush-hour. It caused heavy damage to mud-built houses in the vicinity

Violent: US soldiers and Afghan security officials pass the crater formed at the scene of a suicide car bomb attack

Forty people were wounded in the blast
at around 8 a.m. local time during the morning rush-hour. It caused 
heavy damage to mud-built houses in the vicinity.

The
Hezb-e-Islami insurgent group, which is allied with the Taliban, 
claimed responsibility for the attack on the two-vehicle convoy.

President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack, saying it was the work of 'terrorists and enemies of Afghanistan's peace.'

NATO's International Security 
Assistance Force (ISAF) said the bomber killed two of its members and 
four civilian contractors. It declined to give nationalities.

But two senior officials, one Afghan and the other from ISAF, said the two ISAF soldiers and four contractors were all American.

Afghan officials said nine Afghan civilians were killed, including two children.

'Some of the dead civilians were badly
burnt and can not be recognised,' Kaneshka Baktash, a spokesman for the
Health Ministry, told Reuters.Â 

A suicide car bomb attack in Kabul on Thursday killed six civilians and wounded 37 others, the Afghan health ministry said

Muslim militant group Hizb-e-Islami claimed responsibility for the devastating attack

Toll: Afghan officials said nine Afghan civilians were killed, including two children

Helicopters buzzed over Kabul's diplomatic area after the attack and sirens whined.

'We were in our home drinking tea when
the we heard a blast and our windows shattered, the glass wounded all 
of us,' Zohra, a wounded girl who only gave her first name, said from a 
hospital bed. Her head was wrapped in a bandage.

A Hezb-e-Islami spokesman told Reuters U.S. military advisers were the targets.

'We planned this attack for over a week,' the spokesman, Haroon Zarghoun, said by telephone.

Last year, in a similar attack, the group killed seven South African and Russian pilots on their way to work in Kabul.

Hezb-e-Islami, which means Islamic 
Party, is a radical militant group which shares some of the 
anti-foreigner, anti-government aims of the Taliban.

But the political wing of the group, 
founded by warlord and former anti-Soviet fighter Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, 
has been in exploratory talks with Afghan President Hamid Karzai on a 
peace deal to end the 12-year war.

The National Directorate of Security, 
Afghanistan's intelligence agency, says it thwarts a large number of 
attacks on the capital on a weekly basis.

The last suicide bomb attack in Kabul 
was in March, when a man blew himself up at a Defence Ministry gate, 
killing nine Afghans, during a visit by U.S. Defence Secretary
