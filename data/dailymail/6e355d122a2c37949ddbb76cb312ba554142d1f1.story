Twin schoolgirls who followed their jihadi brother from Manchester to Syria have reportedly married ISIS fighters.

Salma and Zahra Halane, 16, from Chorlton ran away to Syria three weeks ago - and their father has also since travelled out to find them.

Social media accounts reportedly 
belonging to the girls show them posting about learning to use guns and seeing grenades and Kalashnikov rifles.

Communicating with a reporter online, they said they mainly stay in and read the Qur'an unless their husbands take them out.

The social media account says one of the twins is now married to a British man of Afghan 
origin, reported BBC's Newsnight.

An expert in extremism has checked the social media accounts and they are thought to be genuine.

 Maher, an expert on radicalisation, said on the programme: 'These women
 are saying they have chosen to go because they want to support 
fighters.

The sisters were hard-working students who hoped to train as doctors.

The pair achieved 28 GCSEs between them, but last month they 
left their parents’ home in the middle of the night and caught a flight 
to Turkey, before crossing the border.

Police
 said the pair are thought to have followed their elder brother, who 
ditched his own ‘excellent’ academic career to join the ISIS terror 
group around a year ago.

Friends
 said the twins had appeared to be typical teenagers, pouting for 
selfies and shopping at Primark – but they are now feared to be training
 for battle.

Last
 month a rebel fighter boasted that he was teaching girls as young as 16
 how to fight. Yilmaz, a Dutch national who has been in Syria for two 
years said: ‘It’s extremely easy to get here. People go on holiday ... 
they end up in Syria.’  

The twins’ parents raised the alarm after finding the girls’ beds empty and their passports and clothes missing.

A
 former neighbour said the couple had been ‘quite strict’, and did not 
allow the girls to ‘mix with other children on the street’.

Others
 recalled that the twins wore headscarves when they were as young as 
nine. But Rhea Headlam, who sat next to Zahra in primary school, said 
they were ‘just normal teenage girls’.

‘I’m really shocked – I used to bump into them at Primark,’ she added. ‘They were both really clever.’

Last
 summer Salma achieved 13 GCSEs – 11 of them at grades A* to C – while 
Zahra passed 15, of which 12 were A*-C. The results put them in the top 
10 per cent of their year group at Whalley Range High School for Girls 
in Manchester.

They
 went on to study at Connell Sixth Form College, where fellow students 
said they hoped to follow in the footsteps of their elder sister Hafsa, 
25, who is at medical school in Denmark after graduating from Manchester
 University.

‘The twins both have aspirations to become doctors – that is their ambition,’ said one.

Another
 claimed it was ‘typical’ of the girls to head to Syria ‘after they had 
finished term’, adding: ‘They wouldn’t want to mess up their education.

‘I’m shocked they have gone. They didn’t seem to be radical or extremist in their views.’

The girls’ devoutly Muslim Somali refugee parents and their 11 children had been moved from an estate made famous by the TV series Shameless to an upmarket suburb, after telling the council they needed more bedrooms.

They were given a six-bedroom end-terrace despite the protests of the existing tenant.

Neighbours said the twins’ parents were keen to share elements of Somalian culture with them, taking round dishes of traditional delicacies for them to try.

The twins’ father Ibrahim is understood to teach at a nearby mosque, where leaders this week issued a statement repudiating extremism and opposing violence of all kinds.

Mohammed Shafiq, of the Ramadan Foundation, said the family were moderate Muslims who know all about the dangers of war-torn countries. ‘They were desperately unhappy to discover [their son] had gone to Syria, and they thought they were keeping a watchful eye on their other children. Then this happens,’ he said.

Sources believe Salma and Zahra were inspired by their brother’s transformation into a jihadi fighter, and became radicalised themselves while viewing extremist Islamist material online.

According to police sources, their brother also travelled to the family’s native Somalia, where he may have linked up with another Islamist terror group al-Shabab.

A friend told The Sun the brother was known for his ability to recite long passages of the Koran.

Officers are investigating how the girls funded their own trip, over fears they have been bankrolled by jihadi fighters who want them as their wives.

As many as 1,500 Britons may have travelled to Syria to fight alongside rebels. Many of them have posted messages online promising to use their ‘terror skills’ if they return to Britain.
