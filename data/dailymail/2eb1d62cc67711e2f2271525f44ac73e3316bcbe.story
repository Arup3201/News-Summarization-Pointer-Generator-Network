Matt Barlow takes a closer look at the 26 players sent out on loan by Chelsea during the summer transfer window.

Chelsea chief executive Ron Gourlay has defended the club's loan system which has seen 26 players shipped out on temporary deals this season.

The majority of the 26 are younger players though some higher profile names such as Fernando Torres (AC Milan) have also been sent out on loan.

In an interview with the London Evening Standard, Gourlay stressed that Chelsea's focus is on developing and nurturing young talent and not simply stock-piling players.

'What people don't see is that it's a massive development piece,' said Gourlay. 'I'll give you two examples: (Kevin) De Bruyne and (Romelu) Lukaku.

'They were both bought as strong potential future players. We knew they had enough pedigree. Both players were very much in our plans. It didn't work out and the opportunity arose to sell them. Best for the club and best for the players.'

Gourlay, who also spoke of his pride at the club falling in line with UEFA's new Financial Fair Play rules, also revealed the extent to which Chelsea monitor their young loan stars.

He said: 'The loan system is not just a matter of saying, 'Okay, we'll see you in 12 months.' We've only loaned players out to teams that allow day-to-day communication by our management team. Within 30 minutes of a game finishing, every player reports into someone at the club.

Gourlay added: 'That's the reason that these players develop.'
