Sensitive cats have never been fans of loud noises, rapidly disappearing under the bed or table to escape the din.

But now everyday sounds about the house like the clicking of a computer mouse, tapping a boiled egg or opening a can of cat food can trigger seizures in the animal, it has emerged.

Vets are researching the phenomena after owners reported their pets' were behaving oddly to the popping of
 pills from blister packs, the dropping of metal items on tiled floors 
or ceramic bowls and the hammering of nails.

Sensitive: Cats can get seizures from everyday house noises like the clicking of a computer mouse and even the opening of a tin of cat food

Even the noise of 
owners slapping their foreheads or clicking their tongues has affected cats, the Sunday Telegraph reported.

Researchers from University College London and a specialist veterinary centre are investigating anecdotal data sent to them by the charity International Cat Care (ICC).

The animals' reaction is similar to reflex epilepsy in humans, believe experts who have appealed to owners let them carry out tests on their pets.

They want to establish if there is any genetic link which makes some animals more prone and some sounds more likely to trigger a response.

Comic scene: An affected cat ran around in circles before colliding with furniture in a phenomenon likened to Tom and Jerry cartoons

Mark Lowrie, from Davies Veterinary 
Specialists, told the Telegraph: 'We want to see if other vets and owners are aware of
 the problem. It could be they haven’t even associated these fits with 
noise.

A cat called Moochie had fits and lost balance caused by repetitious clicking or tapping sounds, its owner reported.

Another cat called Jeffrey had seizures for about a minute caused by mouse clicks and the tapping of a boiled egg.

Gracie reacted in a similar way to the sound of rustling paper. She ran around in circles and collided with furniture.

'I’m sure that a pattern will emerge. It doesn’t seem to be 
occurring at times of stress. It is often when the cats are being fed – 
which is probably one of their happier times of the day.'

The researchers, who posted appeals on  the ICC's Cat Care Journal and in veterinary publications, believe it could lead to greater understanding of similar conditions in humans.

Seizures suffered by the animals are
 described as being similar to a fit, with the cats displaying a jerking
 motion, the paper reported.

Some of the cats freeze suddenly or are jumpy. They all recovered once the noise stopped and the seizure was over. The attacks are not triggered by the volume of the noise, according to the owners.

Claire Bessant, chief executive of International Cat Care, told the paper: 'It is hard not to smile, because it does all sound rather Tom and Jerry [cartoon], but it would be very nice to get to the bottom of it.

'People seem to be getting around it, by making sure they tip toe around their animals and try to avoid making the noise.'
