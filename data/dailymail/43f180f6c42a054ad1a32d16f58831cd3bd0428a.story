Some MPs, who earn £66,396 a year, are putting in expenses claims to pay for milk used in tea and coffee

Tight-fisted MPs are getting  taxpayers to pick up the tab for  their milk.

Politicians have been accused of not knowing the price of a pint of milk – but some MPs, despite picking up salaries of £66,396, are putting in expenses claims to pay for milk used in tea and coffee in their Westminster and constituency offices.

An analysis of the latest expenses data reveals Labour’s business spokesman Chuka Umunna was reimbursed for 15 recent milk claims.

They added up to £6.79 and included a dozen claims for 40p each, two for 89p and one for £1.10.

The south London MP, who has been tipped
 as a future leader of his party, also made three claims totalling £9.41
 for milk and coffee.

In most instances, the politician, who 
worked as an employment lawyer prior to his election in 2010, said it 
was for meetings at one of his two offices.

Defence secretary Phillip Hammond has also been counting the pennies.

The Conservative minister submitted two 40p expenses for ‘office milk’ and a £1.65 claim for milk and water, the latest figures show.

The expenses data has been published by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority and includes 35,508 claims  processed in August and September.

Of these claims, more than 130 related to milk expenses and were submitted by a total of 34 MPs.

They include four by Labour’s Andy  Burnham and three by Health minister Norman Lamb, whose claims also covered tea and coffee.

Former business minister Rosie Winterton – who in 2009 repaid £8,250 wrongly claimed on her mortgage – had £12.90 in milk expenses.

Home Office minister Norman Baker also made three claims of £15, £12 and 89p for 'office milk'.

Labour’s
 Hugh Bayley, previously criticised for claiming cycling expenses, 
former Tory minister Malcolm Rifkind are also among the milk drinkers.

The most milk related expenses were from Scottish Labour MP Sandra Osborne, who made 17 claims.

A spokesman for Mr Umunna said: ‘We regularly hold meetings with constituents and local organisations as well as surgeries at our office and this cost was incurred  for those purposes.

'The claims were submitted and approved in the normal way.’
