A devoted husband's 4,000 mile search for his missing wife has come to an abrupt halt - after the homemade cart he used to criss-cross China was destroyed by fire.

Loyal Li Guanjun, 57, turned a farm truck into a makeshift mobile home and used it to travel the country in search of his wife Yao Guo, who disappeared in Beijing last year.

Li - who said he was lucky to escape with his life after the cart caught fire while he slept inside - has vowed to build a new mode of transport to continue his search, insisting: 'I can never give up'.

Disaster: The devoted husband's 4,000 mile search came to an abrupt halt when his homemade cart burned down

The couple were in Beijing when Li's wife, who has a mental disorder, disappeared.

Busker Li asked his wife to wait for him while he was performing in the street, but when he returned she had gone.

He has been searching for her ever since, but his truck has now been destroyed after it went up in flames in Tianjin, northern China.

'I was asleep when I suddenly woke up and smelled smoke,' said Li, who makes a living by playing traditional Chinese music.

'The whole thing 
was on fire and I was lucky to get out with my life,' said Li.

Determined Li has said he will build a new vehicle and resume his search for his missing wife, 56.

'I can never give up no matter how long it takes,' he explained.
