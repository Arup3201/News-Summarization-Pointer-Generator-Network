'He's got his life back but mine is ruined': Demi Bowers was aged just 13 when she was abused

When a neighbour who sexually abused her was jailed, Demi Bowers hoped she had seen the last of him.

So she was devastated when she looked out of her house and saw John Breckon staring at her from across the road.

She was even more horrified to discover that he had moved back into the street after completing his prison sentence.

Now the teenager has been forced to leave her family home and move miles away to escape Breckon, who groomed and abused her when she was 13.

‘I was home alone and I saw him across the street staring at me from the window laughing,’ said Mrs Bowers, now 18, who has waived her right to anonymity and is calling for a change in the law to ban paedophiles from living near their victims.

‘I rang my mum crying and she said I was seeing things. But then she came back and saw for herself. He’s got his life back whereas I have had to move house and I am the victim.’

Breckon, 52, showered her with gifts before sexually assaulting her over a five-month period while his wife worked night shifts.

The attacks happened after Mrs Bowers began babysitting after school for the former factory worker, then a family friend, in Bridlington, East Yorkshire.

She viewed him as a father-figure but he became infatuated with her.

She eventually told her teachers and in 2010 Breckon was jailed at Hull Crown Court after he admitted sexual activity with a child.

He was released in 2012 after serving half his two-and-a-half-year sentence but initially was banned from Bridlington. However, the restriction ended in February last year.

Mrs Bowers, who has moved away with 
her partner Natalia Bowers, 25, said: ‘When the ban ended, I saw him at 
the house his mother left him in her will across the road.

‘When he was jailed I became obsessed 
with thinking he was there. I was constantly locking doors. I suffer 
from depression and anxiety because of what happened to me.

Forced to move: She says she now suffers severe anxiety and depression and is too afraid to leave the house

'There’s nothing stopping him now and I still keep thinking he is there. He has his house and his wife and has his life back but I am suffering because I have to live far away from my family.’

'He's got his life back whereas I have had to move house and I am the victim'

It is understood that Breckon spends 
part of his time at the house, which he is renovating, and the rest of 
the time at his family home nearby with his wife Karen, 49, a nurse, and
 their five-year-old daughter.

Mrs Bowers said: ‘He was infatuated 
with me when I was 13. He placed a mirror in the bedroom angled so he 
could see directly across into my room.’

Her mother Angela Kingston, 39, a 
voluntary worker, said: ‘We are living in the 21st century and a 
convicted paedophile is allowed to live opposite his victim and nothing 
is stopping him.

New life: Mrs Bowers married her partner Natalia (left), 25, earlier this year and is hoping to go to college

‘My daughter was robbed of her 
childhood, she can’t come and visit her own mum. He was sat in the 
window watching her from her bedroom and now she is too scared to be 
here.’

She said Breckon was taunting them. 
‘There is no law stopping it and I feel let down. He has more human 
rights than she does. She has had to move away.’

Adam Pemberton of Victim Support said:
 ‘Too many times, too many victims of violent or sexual assaults tell us
 they do not feel safe when the person convicted of a crime against them
 is released.

Police declined to comment, as did Breckon. His wife told reporters: ‘He is entitled to live where he wants.’
