An Australian cricket announcer has been sacked on the spot after using an Indian accent to pronounce the name of Engand spinner Monty Panesar.

David Nixon was fired from his match-day duties by Cricket Australia after his announcement in England's tour match at Traeger Park.

He appeared to mock the cricketer, who plays for Essex, and was relieved of his duties after lunch on the second and final day.

There were reports that he used an Indian accent when announcing the name of England bowler Monty Panesar, but CA would not comment on the specifics of the dismissal.

Sacked David Nixon took to Twitter to say England's Monty Panesar was a cult hero and he 'loved' him

A spokesman for the Australian board 
did nonetheless say on Saturday afternoon: 'Cricket Australia deemed the
 conduct of the PA announcer as inappropriate and as such he will take 
no further part in the match.'

'There will be no further comment from CA until a review of events has been completed.'

But Nixon took to his Twitter account to explain that his 'style' did not work with the broadcaster.He wrote: 'Really? I love Monty P - cult hero. He should bat 3. My style didn't fit theirs. That's all.'

Nixon,
 an Austalian Broadcasting Corporation employee, undertook the PA job 
separately in the tourists' fixture against a CA Chairman XI.

He was already on a warning after being told off on the first day for making a sarcastic comment over the tannoy when Joe Root was out, along the lines of â€˜Now you can go and have a drink Joe.'

Panesar picked up three wickets for England as they drew their tour match in Alice Springs.

Ian Bell, leading England in Alice Springs in the absence of the rested Alastair Cook, appeared mystified by the turn of events.

The England and Wales Cricket Board made no complaint about Nixon, and was unaware of his sacking until told by the hosts.

At his post-match press conference, Bell said: 'We weren't aware of it, didn't know anything about it.

'Until now ... I don't think any of the team were. We were focused on the cricket.

'You could hear him through the game, but hadn't heard he'd been sacked.'

The
 controversy over Nixon's performance comes against an antagonistic 
backdrop so far in this winter's Ashes, which has included an outbreak 
of 'sledging' in England's first-Test defeat at the Gabba last week and a
 frosty, partisan reception for the tourists from media and home crowds 
alike.

Fellow spinner Graeme Swann also claimed four wickets, but fast bowlers Steven Finn and Boyd Rankin both struggled in the sweltering heat.

England head to Adelaide for the second Ashes Test, which begins on Thursday, looking to bounce back from their massive defeat in Brisbane.

The Test was overshadowed by some heated verbal exchanges, most notably when Australian captain Michael Clarke confronted Jimmy Anderson.
