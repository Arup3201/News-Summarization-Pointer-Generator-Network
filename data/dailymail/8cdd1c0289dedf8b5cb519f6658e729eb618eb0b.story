Embattled Clippers owner Donald Sterling received the SNL treatment in the show's opening gambit.

The show, hosted this week by Spiderman actor Andrew Garfield, got straight to the week's big story of Sterling's leaked racist rant and the subsequent fallout in its cold opener.

Bobby Moynihan as the octogenarian billionaire insisted that he, in fact, is the real victim in the whole affair.

Basketball diary: SNL's skit sees Sterling holding a press conference to redeem himself after racist remarks got him banned from the NBA

'My reputation has gotten a real black eye, which we all know is the worst kind of eye,' he says in a press conference in which he's apparently trying to redeem himself for the racist comments he was recorded making that were leaked last week.

He goes on to say that he intends to use every penny of the $1 billion that he'll earn from the sale of the Clippers to repair his relationship with the black community, especially Magic Johnson, 'who was clearly one of the good ones.'

'So I have been learning about your history,' he says. 'Today, I watched Roots on TV, and let me tell you, that Questlove, very talented, very talented boy.'

New love: Sterling says far from being racist, he has a new girlfriend who is 'three-quarter black'

He then explains that he plans to spend $3 million to take young black men on a cruise to the beautiful Ivory Coast off Africa 'to never come back!'

The show made no mention of Sterling's 'personal assistant' V. Stiviano who gave an interview to Barbara Walters on 20/20 last night, but the businessman's love life was fair game.

He explains that he has parted ways with his 'half-black mistress Ms Stiviano' and has now taken a mistress who is 'three-quarters black.'

'Listen, I know y'all are like, "She don't have no dignity!" Well you know what I do have? A new Lexus convertible!' says 'Kayla,' before describing sex with Sterling as 'like a leather tent's collapsed on me.'

Good judge of character: Dennis Rodman says Sterling is one of the greatest men he knows, right up there with Kim Jong Un

The next person to vouch for Sterling is former NBA star Dennis Rodman, who says Sterling is 'a good man,' and that he should know because he is, 'above all, a good judge of character.'

'And this is one of the greatest men I've ever met, right up there with my main man, glorious leader Kim Jong Un,' he says.

The LA chapter of the NAACP also came in for a drubbing from SNL for awarding Sterling a Lifetime Achievement award, essentially for giving them a lot of money.

The only person, according to the skit, who had a great week during the Sterling controversy, was NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who says, 'I have gotten more high fives from random black people this week than any other week in my life. And I have learned many wonderful new handshakes.'
