Workers at an electronics factory in China just wanted to have their carrot cake and eat it - but walked out in protest when they didn't get any.

Thousands of workers at the Dongguan Wintek plant in Guangdong province walked out after a row with managers over a promise to supply cash bonuses and free moon cakes, a traditional Chinese treat.

Moon cake, known in the west as carrot cake, is served at this time of year to mark China's mid-Autumn Festival, where people give thanks to the moon for providing light for night harvesting.

Protest: Thousands of workers at the Dongguan Wintak plant in Guangdong province walked out after a row with managers over a promise to supply cash bonuses and free moon cakes, a traditional Chinese treat

Managers appealed for calm after workers walked out of the Dongguan Wintak plant

Thousands of workers took to the streets claiming that bosses had broken promises of productivity bonuses.

They claimed managers had pledged to pay workers £60 a head for working through a public holiday, and provide a package of moon cakes to celebrate the feast.

Worker Cai Shen told local media: 'They promised us more money and moon cakes and we got neither.' 

Police and factory managers eventually convinced workers to return to their workshops after more than four hours of demonstrations.

Factory spokesman Dong Teng said: 'It was a misunderstanding which we are solving. We don't want our workers to be unhappy.'  

The factory workers were eventually coaxed back in
