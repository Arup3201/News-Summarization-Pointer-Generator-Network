Soaring numbers of young children are being sent to hospital because GPs are increasingly unavailable to deal with even common infections, a report claims.

The rate of children requiring emergency admission rose by more than a quarter in the 12 years to 2010, researchers say.

The largest jump was among under-fives, including a 52 per cent increase in emergency admissions of babies since 2003.

Common infections – not life-threatening illnesses – were to blame for much of the rise, which suggests a ‘systematic failure in the NHS’ according to the study involving seven million admissions.

It found a ‘persistent’ increase year-on-year of around 3 per cent among under-fives.

The study says there is a ‘reluctance’ to  treat children at surgeries, driven by changes to the GP contract in 2004 which led to  90 per cent of family doctors opting out  of caring for patients during evenings  and weekends.

Study leader Peter Gill, a researcher in the department of primary care health services at Oxford University, said emergency admissions put children at risk of hospital-acquired infections, medical errors, drug reactions and emotional trauma.

The study, published online in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, looked at hospital admission rates among the under-15s in England and national population estimates for the years 1999 to 2010 inclusive.

The emergency admissions rate among children rose by 28 per cent from 63 per 1,000 of the population in 1999 to 81 per 1,000 in 2010.

But the increase in admissions does not reflect an increase in the number of very sick children – on the contrary, the risk of serious illness is low and falling, the study says.

The number of deaths of children aged one to 14 fell by 36 per cent during the study. Mr Gill said parents and doctors were more likely to ‘play safe’ when a  child is ill.

Targets for A&E might also have  contributed to the rise, he suggested, with children being admitted for observation before the four-hour maximum wait  was breached.

He said that and ‘the change to general practitioners’ out-of-hours care may have played an important role’.

The British Medical Association said a key factor for the increase ‘is likely to be the more cautious approach being taken to the treatment of children’.
