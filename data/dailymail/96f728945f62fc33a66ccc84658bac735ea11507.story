Ravel Morrison has been pictured training again with West Ham despite still having a court case hanging over his head.

The midfielder will appear at Manchester Crown Court on August 28 after being charged with two counts of common assault, against his ex-girlfriend and her mother, and harassment.

But as he looks to step up his preparations for the new season, he has returned to training at Upton Park, along with free agent Matthew Etherington.

West Ham begin their Premier League campaign with the visit of Tottenham to Upton Park on Saturday.

Sam Allardyce hopes he can lead the Hammers to a top 10 finish, and is scouring Europe to find a striker who can help them along the way.

'If we score a few more goals than last season, we can finish top 10,' he told reporters. 'If we can do the same as we did last season defensively then 50 goals will be enough for us.

'We scored 40 last year and 46 the year before so if we hit the 50-goal mark that will be enough to take us into the top 10 or better.'
