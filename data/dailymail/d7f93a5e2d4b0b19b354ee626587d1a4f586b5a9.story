A woman with a desire to put wrongs to right
 combined with the ability to keep cool in a drama.

These are the characteristics that apparently spring to a man's mind when a woman reveals she is a human rights lawyer, according to a new poll.

Journalists, meanwhile, are perceived as quick-thinking, intelligent, with a sexy lifestyle.

Women who are journalists and human rights lawyers are thought to be sexy do-gooders

If you're a man though, a doctor is the most attractive job: the ultimate ‘caring' profession, doctors are seen as supportive and authoritative, according to a new report on the most fanciable professions.

The jobs guaranteed to bag you a partner are revealed in the Valentine's Day Dream Date survey, released by author and long-time matchmaker Mary Balfour, who's been running Britian's first personal dating agency for 30 years.

Mary's annual survey, now in its 14th year, reveals the most frequently
 requested professions for the perfect partner at her personal dating 
agency Drawing Down the Moon.

Between 1 January and 31 December last year, a female human rights lawyer and a journalist rated as the sexiest dream dates for men seeking the love of their life, whereas women seeking Mr Right were more likely to opt for a doctor, an architect or a man in another creative profession.

Photography and graphic design are also good choices of professional fields to get into for attracting a man

The survey suggests that modern women are looking for a mate who is in a creative or caring field rather than a 
high-powered banker.

And although earning power may be important when 
choosing a mate, job satisfaction, authority, plus concern with the 
human condition rate highly as turn-ons with both men and women.

Mary and her team interviewed 615 single women (ages 24-68) and 489 single men (ages 30-72) for this year's annual report.

Mary and her team at Drawing Down The Moon always do in-depth in person interviews with their clients.

To be accepted for matchmaking, applicants must be educated, whether that be at University, college - or even the School of Life. Mary says they have many clients who may have side-stepped formal education but who are successful in the creative world. And they don't accept people they can't match.

The team ask clients about their background, relationship history and more, and especially about the type of person they'd like to meet. The question for the survey was 'What is the most likely profession your future partner might be working in?'

The descriptions below are the team's intuitive take and expert analysis based on 30 years of feedback after clients have been on a date with someone who works in the professions listed.
