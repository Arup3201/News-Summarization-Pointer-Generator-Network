A cheating wife shot dead her husband so that she could be with her lover, police have said.

Cindy Reese, 40, and her boyfriend Jeffery Brown, 36, have been charged with murder nearly a month after Michael Earl Reese, 40, was found killed in the couple's kitchen in Morris, Alabama.

Cindy Reese had called Morris police at 8pm on February 18 to say that she had arrived home and found the house in disarray, indicating there had been a robbery, AL.com reported.

But when police arrived and checked the home on Banks Street, they found Mr Reese fatally shot in the head.

Arrested: Cindy Reese, 40, and Jeffery Brown, 36, were arrested on Wednesday for the murder of Reese's husband at their Alabama home last month. Police say the pair plotted the murder so they could be together

The department called the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office for help investigating a homicide, and detectives found that there were no signs of forced entry at the home and nothing was missing.

The day after the murder, Jefferson County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Randy Christian said it was unusual for a burglary to happen that time of night and there was 'a good possibility that was staged', WSFA reported. 

He said that the killing did not appear random and that the victim likely knew his killer. 

Investigators then learned that Cindy Reese, who married her husband in 2009, had been having an affair with Brown. Property records indicate that Brown lives with a woman.

Killed: Mrs Reese, pictured with her husband Michael Reese on their wedding day in 2009, called authorities to her home on February 18 saying that it was in disarray. Officers searched the house and found his body

Murdered: Detectives said they found no signs of a forced break in or anything missing at the home when they discovered Mr Reese's body. Investigators later discovered Mrs Reese was having an affair

The duo had plotted to kill Mr Reese so that they could be together, Chief Deputy Randy Christian of the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office told AL.com.

He said the murder was the result of 'dark hearts, stupidity and extreme selfishness'.

'I think we all understand matters of the heart and the ups, downs, ebbs and flows of relationships,' Christian said. 'What we can't understand and will never understand is someone getting so twisted, dark and lost that they believe cold-blooded murder is the answer. 

Brown and Reese were taken into custody on Wednesday as he dropped her off following a lunch date, police said, and both are being held on $100,000 bail.

The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office announced the murder charges on Wednesday.
