Ford has put its biggest-selling pickup truck on a radical diet before launching it today - stripping more than 700lbs from it compared to previous versions.

The F-150 - one of which sold every 41 seconds during 2013 making a $7.6 billion profit in the U.S. alone - is almost entirely made from lightweight aluminum. 

The redesign is an attempt to improve the trucks fuel economy after the U.S. government ordered manufacturers to make cars and trucks with a combined 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.

All new: Ford has totally redesigned its best-selling F-150 pickup truck, shedding 700lbs on the previous model

It was unveiled today at the North American International Auto Show at the Cobo Center in Detroit.

The use of light alloys in 97 per cent of the construction is a revolutionary change for a vehicle known for its heft and an industry still heavily reliant on steel.

The truck is Ford's response to small-business owners' desire for a more fuel-efficient and nimble truck - and stricter government requirements on fuel economy.

And it sprang from a challenge by Ford's CEO to move beyond the traditional design for a full-size pickup.

Chief Executive Alan Mulally said: 'You're either moving ahead and you're improving and you're making it more valuable and more useful to the customer or you're not.'

F-Series trucks - which include the F-150 and heavier duty models like the F-250 - have been the best-selling vehicles in the U.S. for the last 32 years.

But while the construction techniques and material are ground-breaking, the F-Series still bears a striking resemblance to previous models which date bake to 1948.

The key question for Ford, and the 
people who sell its trucks, is: Will customers embrace such a radical 
change? Dealers who have seen the new F-150 say they expect to encounter
 some skepticism, but the change had to be made.

'We're
 aggressive, stretching the envelope,' said Sam Pack, owner of four Ford
 dealerships in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. 'I think you have to do 
that. If you don't, then you get into that predicament of being a "me 
too" vehicle.'

Still, it's a
 big risk. Ford makes an estimated $10,000 profit on every F-Series 
truck it sells, making trucks a $7.6 billion profit center in the U.S. 
alone last year.

And the company has had some quality issues with recent vehicle launches, adding to dealers' worries. The 2013 Escape small SUV has been the subject of seven recalls.

The 2015 F-150 goes on sale late this 
year. While aluminum is more expensive that steel, Ford truck marketing 
chief Doug Scott says the F-Series will stay within the current price 
range.

F-Series trucks now range from a starting price of $24,445 for a base model to $50,405 for a top-of-the-line Limited.

It's difficult to calculate how much more aluminum costs, since there are different grades of aluminum and steel.

Pete
 Reyes, the F-150's chief engineer, said Ford expects to make up the 
premium by reducing its recycling costs, since there will be less metal 
to recycle, and by slimming down the engine and other components, since 
they won't have to move so much weight.

Refinement: Ford has redesigned the F-Series range under pressure from the Government to improve their fuel efficiency

Aluminum was used on cars even before the first F-Series went on sale in 1948. It's widely used on sporty, low-volume cars now, like the Tesla Model S electric sedan and the Land Rover Evoque. U.S. Postal Service trucks are also made of aluminum.

Ford has spent decades researching the metal. Twenty years ago, the company built a fleet of 20 all-aluminum experimental sedans.

Later, it used aluminum on exotic cars
 from Aston-Martin and Jaguar, brands it used to own. But up to now, 
Ford limited the aluminum on its trucks to the hoods and used steel for 
the rest.

New government 
fuel economy requirements, which mandate that automakers' cars and 
trucks get a combined 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025, are speeding the 
switch to aluminum.

Chrysler's Ram is currently the most fuel-efficient pickup, getting 25 mpg on the highway.

The
 current F-150 gets as much as 23 mpg. Ford won't say what the new 
truck's fuel economy will be, but says it will trump the competition.

Profit: 2009 Ford F-100 Pickup is part of the F-Series range which has helped the company book considerable profits

That could be an especially important 
incentive for landscapers, carpenters and other small business owners 
focused on their bottom line.

'I
 think that's going to outweigh the aluminum part of it,' said Brian 
Jarrett, a Ford dealer in Winter Haven, Fla., who hasn't yet seen the 
new truck.

Improvements in 
aluminum are also driving the change. Three years ago, for example, 
Alcoa Inc. - one of Ford's suppliers for the F-150 - figured out a way 
to pretreat aluminum so it would be more durable when parts are bonded 
together.

Carmakers can now use three or four 
rivets to piece together parts that would have needed 10 rivets before, 
Alcoa spokesman Kevin Lowery said.

And
 Ford is able to take more risks. When the F-150 was last redesigned, in
 the mid-2000s, Ford was losing billions each year and resources were 
spread thin.

But by 
2010, when the company gave the green light to an all-aluminum truck, 
Ford was making money again. CEO Alan Mulally, a former Boeing Co. 
executive who joined Ford in 2006, encouraged his team to think bigger.

After
 all, it was Mulally who led early development of Boeing's Dreamliner, 
which replaced aluminum with even lighter-weight plastics to be more 
efficient and fly further.

'Everything
 becomes more efficient once you take the weight out,' Mulally says. He 
expects aluminum to be used across Ford's model lineup in the future.

In the genes: The F-Series trucks have been one of Ford's most profitable models, including this 1967 F-100

Ford is convinced truck buyers will accept the change. The company says the new truck will tow more and haul more, since the engine doesn't have to account for so much weight. It can also accelerate and stop more quickly. Aluminum doesn't rust, Ford says, and it's more resistant to dents.

Reyes says the company planted prototype F-150s with three companies - in mining, construction and power - for two years without revealing they were aluminum. The companies didn't notice a difference.

Mulally says Ford's customers have already shown a willingness to adopt new technology. Forty percent of the F-Series trucks sold last year had Ford's more efficient EcoBoost engines, for example, which were introduced just three years ago. And Mulally says owners trust Ford.

Ford will still have a tough time wresting customers from the competition, mainly Chevrolet, GMC and Ram, says Jesse Toprak, an independent auto industry consultant in Los Angeles.

'Movement between brands in the full-size truck segment is extremely minimal,' Toprak says. 'It's the strongest loyalty of any segment.'

Hit: The F-Series trucks, a 1948 F-1 model pictured, has been a hit with American customers since it was launched 66 years ago

Still, about 20 per cent of pickup buyers traditionally are open to jumping from brand to brand based on features or price, Toprak said. The company with the newest, most advanced truck has the advantage in getting those customers, plus those who are new to the market, Toprak says.

Some steel remains on the truck. The frame beneath it is built primarily of high-strength steel, which Ford says will make it tougher and stiffer than the current frame.

There's also steel in the front dashboard, because Ford thought steel was better at dampening nose from the engine.

In all, a four-door F-150 has 660 pounds of aluminum, or nearly double the average use of aluminum per vehicle used now, according to Drive Aluminum, an aluminum industry Web site.

If the Ford truck is a success, use of aluminum could expand rapidly at the expense of steel.

'People are beginning to truly understand the value that aluminum can bring to the table,' Lowery said.

Ford is expecting some issues with the design or the manufacturing as it makes the change, Mulally said. But the company is working hard to troubleshoot.

'I think the attitude is, expect the unexpected and expect to deal with it,' he says. 'Sometimes I think our core competency is scrambling. That's not unique to Ford.'
