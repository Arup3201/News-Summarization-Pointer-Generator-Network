In an interview with the National Enquirer, Lee 'Uncle Poodle' Thompson claims that his brother, Sugar Bear, June, and Sugar Bear's older brother Billy had a 'threesome.'

What's more, Uncle Poodle even shared text messages he had with June talking about the incident.

Shocking report: A new interview claims that June 'Mama June' Shannon and her estranged husband Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson had a threesome with his brother

Third: The other man in the threesome was Billy (above with June's daughter), Sugar Bear's brother

'June said all of the kids were out of the house and Billy came over to visit them,' Uncle Poodle told the Enquirer. 

'Billy happened to see her in her undergarments. He then told June, "If you are dressed like that when I get back, I'm going to have sex with you."'

Poodle then says that when Billy came back June was 'naked in bed and they ended up having a threesome.'

When asked about the incident, Billy said he 'couldn't remember.'

Then, over the weekend, Poodle posted  text message exchange he had with June in which she reportedly writes to him; 'IM GOING TO CONFRONT EVERYONE ON EVERYTHING BCYES YOU HAVE STARTED SOME LIES.'

She then reportedly goes on to write; 'OH AND YEAH YOUR FAKE DATE WITH NATIONAL ENQUIOR WHEN YOU TOLD HIM ABOUT ME BILLY AND SUGAR BEAR IT'S OKAY BC THAT IS MY PAST.'

Mama June has not responded officially to these claims, and Uncle Poodle is not backing down. 

'I would be more than happy to take another polygraph test (based) on what June told me,' he said.

'If she denies it.'

This all comes as Mama June's annual toy drive has taken a massive hit after she was accused of getting back together with her sex offender ex Mark McDaniel.

Her popular reality show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, was cancelled by TLC after photos emerged of her with the convicted child molester and youngest daughter Alana Thompson.

What's mire, June's oldest daughter, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, recently came forwards and said that McDaniel repeatedly abused her when she was just a child.

Mail Online reached out to Sugar Bear from comment but has not heard back.
