Jose Mourinho claims it would not be a failure if his Chelsea team finish second, despite being title favourites and having spent £75million in the transfer market.

Mourinho derided Arsene Wenger as a ‘specialist in failure’ last season, referring to the Arsenal manager’s nine years without a trophy, which finally ended in May when Arsenal won the FA Cup.

But the Portuguese seems to have softened his tone for this season, saying: ‘It’s the only league in the world where four, five or six clubs are title contenders. Only one can win. Do the other five fail? I don’t think so.

‘One view is that one succeeded and five failed. Another view is that three, four or five did fantastically but only one won.’

Chelsea open their season at Turf Moor against Burnley on Monday and Mourinho added: ‘I can do nothing more than say: “We feel we are title contenders.” The only thing I can add is that probably, if you ask every manager in the Premier League are you a title contender, probably four, five or six will tell you, “Yes.”

Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich and the Stamford Bridge board expect Mourinho to challenge for the title. But they seem to have a greater understanding of the increased competitiveness of the Premier League and appreciate that winning the league is more difficult than ever.

Mourinho is the only manager in the Abramovich era to have kept his job despite not having won a trophy at the end of the season, Claudio Ranieri and Avram Grant being the two previous incumbents sacked for that failing. But despite their heavy spending, Chelsea have balanced the books this summer, selling David Luiz for £50m, Romelu Lukaku for £28m and Demba Ba for £4.7m.

And Mourinho said: ‘If the team finishing first is better than us — if we are very good but somebody is better than us — that’s football. That’s not a failure. The only thing you can do is be good.

‘We have to be good, we have to better than last season as a team, the quality of our game, in everything we have to be better.

‘We have to fight for the title and after that if somebody is really better than us, it’s because they were fantastic.’
