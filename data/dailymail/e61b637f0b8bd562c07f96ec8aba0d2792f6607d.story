Real Madrid will sell Sami Khedira in January unless there is a breakthrough in contract negotiations.

The Germany international was poised to leave in the summer with Arsenal and Chelsea keen to take him while Bayern Munich also wanted the midfielder.

However, Bayern’s surprise move for Xabi Alonso instead meant Madrid put the blocks on his departure.

Now Khedira and his representatives are no closer to committing to Madrid and with the player out of contract in the summer, the European champions are looking to sell rather than lose him for nothing in the summer.

They will contact Europe’s top clubs to test the market with Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester United among those they will look to.

Madrid have a good relationship with United following summer business involving Angel di Maria and Javier Hernandez, however, the lack of Champions League football will affect the player’s decision.

Khedira has a good relationship with Jose Mourinho from his time at Madrid while he is a fan of Arsenal’s footballing style but they may struggle to match his £200,000-a-week wages.

Further talks are planned with his representatives but if no progress is made, Madrid will look to sell for around £10million.
