Bournemouth have added extra firepower to their promotion effort with the loan signing of Kenwyne Jones from Cardiff City.

Prominent sources at Bournemouth and Cardiff told Sportsmail on Thursday that the deal will be completed subject to international clearance.

The move will infuriate elements of the Cardiff support, who have seen their squad decimated since relegation as Russell Slade seeks to slash their wage bill.

Jones is the club’s top earner on a salary understood to be in excess of £30,000 a week, but in January Slade insisted he wanted to keep the 30-year-old, saying: ‘He is our leading scorer. I’ve had assurances. At this stage there is no kind of mandate to lose Kenwyne Jones at all.’

Jones has scored 13 goals for City this season but, assuming the move goes through ahead of Thursday’s loan deadline, he will join the Championship leaders.
