Robert F Kennedy Jr. is being subpoenaed over the exact nature of his relationship with his alleged mistress Chelsea Kirwan, Daily Mail Online can reveal.

The Kennedy scion, who only married actress Cheryl Hines in August, is being dragged into the bitter divorce battle between Mrs Kirwan and her estranged husband, plastic surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan.

Dr Kirwan’s lawyers have filed a motion to depose Bobby, 60, in New York State on February 10 and he can be called upon under New York State law to testify.

Close friendship: Chelsea Kirwan, pictured in June outside her local gym in Bedford, New York, is believed to have had a friendship with Bobby Kennedy Jr. that spanned two years

The case is being heard in Conneticut, and court papers state: 'Since the said person resides outside the state of Connecticut and is not subject to jurisdiction of this Court, his testimony cannot be compelled at the trial of this action, but said testimony can be obtained by deposition before the Commissioner appointed in New York by this Court, who can then under New York State law compel the attendance before him of such witness.

'Defendant thus requests that he be permitted to use the transcript of said deposition at trial.' 

As MailOnline has reported, Dr Kirwan, 62, was aware that his former wife had enjoyed a close friendship with Bobby. 

A source said: 
‘Laurence was well aware that his wife and Bobby had a friendship before
 their split and that they have had ongoing telephone calls.’

Bobby, who this week was seen hobnobbing with his wife, potential 2016 Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Ethel Kennedy at the RFK Ripple Of Hope Gala at the Hilton Hotel in Manhattan, allegedly had a two-year 'affair' with Chelsea, 42, which was reported earlier this year.

Soon
 after the news became public, a source said Bobby was set to be 
questioned under oath as part of the Kirwans' divorce case, saying: 
'Chelsea fears Laurence’s lawyers want to discredit her as a wife and a 
mom.

It is believed a 
friendship between Bobby and Chelsea started well before the Kirwans 
separated on July 4, 2012 - and a source told how Chelsea’s cell phone 
records showed she was speaking to Bobby five times a day in August 
2012.

The pair were also 
pictured together at an event in Seattle in April 2013, where Bobby 
feted mountaineer Jim Whittaker. And she is believed to have accompanied
 him around the country.

Dr Kirwan's lawyers want to ascertain whether the friendship started during the Kirwans marriage - and what the exact nature of the friendship was.

Estranged: Surgeon to the stars Laurence Kirwan and his soon to be ex wife Chelsea at a party. Sources close to Prof Kirwan claimed the mother of three of his children had an 'inappropriate' relationship with Robert F Kennedy Jr

Father-of-six Bobby married Curb Your Enthusiasm actress Cheryl, 49, on August
 2 at the Kennedy compound on Hyannis Port, Mass, in front of the Kennedy 
clan, including his mother Ethel Kennedy, and watched by a starry crowd 
including Cheryl’s former co-star and good friend Larry David and Julia 
Louis-Dreyfuss, while Natasha Bedingfield serenaded them.

His second wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy - the mother of four of his children - killed herself in May 2012.

And
 asked about their relationship, Cheryl said: 'We share the same values.
 Family first. We like to have a good time and work hard. It’s fun to 
have a partner...It’s a good match-up.'

The
 new Mr and Mrs Kennedy have since bought a $5m home in Malibu, 
California and Bobby now spends the majority of his time on the West 
Coast with his family.

He is believed to be spending two days a week in New York teaching at Pace Law School.

The 
Kirwans have had an acrimonious split.  Last month, Dr Kirwan had charges dropped after completing two years probation after being charged with attacking his ex-wife and step-daughter at their home in Connecticut. 

He also has been reinstated at the Hospital of St John and St Elizabeth in St John’s Wood, London, following a month-long suspension after his arrest.

However, Dr Kirwan, who has offices in London, New York and Connecticut, is now dealing with another legal issue after a bookkeeper at his Norwalk, Conn. office was accused of stealing at least $209,075.

Gloria Tamayo, 43, was arrested after Norwalk Detective William Maloney, a certified fraud investigator, examined financial records in Dr Kirwan’s office. \

He discovered Tamayo had been writing unauthorized checks since 2010, embezzling at least $209,075, according to the Hour report.

'We share the same values': Cheryl Hines - pictured with Robert F Kennedy Jr at the Deer Valley Celebrity Skifest in Utah in December 2012 - spoke out about their  marriage, saying: 'It's fun to have a partner. It's a good match up.'

When reached by Daily Mail Online, Dr Kirwan declined to comment, while Chelsea Kirwan Chapman declined to comment.
