With less than 10 months to the next General Election, politicians are keen to make a good impression on the public.

If the findings of new research by consultants The Buzzz are anything to go by, they have a lot of work to do.

One thousand voters were shown photographs of each main party leader and asked for an instant reaction.

'Frustrating', 'disgusting' and 'confusing' - the poll's verdict on  David Cameron (left), Nick Clegg (centre) and Ed Miliband (right)

David Cameron frustrated the public, Ed Miliband confused them and Nick Clegg disgusted them.

Twenty-nine per cent of potential voters were 'frustrated' by the Prime Minister compared to Nick Clegg who left 24 per cent frustrated and 21 per cent who felt the same way about the leader of the Opposition.

Deputy Prime Minister Clegg will be shocked to find that 21 per cent of respondents find him 'disgusting', just ahead of his boss on 20 per cent with Mr Miliband trailing on 10 per cent.

None of the three leaders inspired positive thoughts among the polled voters – Ed Miliband's 'net emotional resonance' score was -32. Mr Cameron scored -42. Mr Clegg suffered the worst score of -51.

Nigel Farage (with the wine bottle): 'people have conflicting emotions about him'

Nigel Farage, the leader of Ukip and possible future MP for South Thanet, did well with 19 per cent of voters being 'intrigued' by him.

The final report says: 'Results confirm the apathy and anonymity political leaders engender in the public — the largest proportions said they felt 'nothing' or 'frustrated', even 'disgusted'.

'Nigel Farage is different because people have conflicting emotions about him ... he is five times more intriguing than Cameron and Clegg and twice as intriguing as Miliband.

'The big question is whether people will vote for a politician they find intriguing. Farage stands out from the pack, who appear to be receding into neutrality, which is worrying in a democracy admired around the world.'

Nigel Farage did well but pollster wonders if people will vote for someone they find 'intriguing'
