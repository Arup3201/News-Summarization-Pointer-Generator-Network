A Maine woman says she was forced to use a pair of Karate nunchucks on her knife-wielding, jealous ex-boyfriend when she couldn't get through to 911.

According to police, the unidentified woman and her ex-boyfriend Christopher Fox got into a fight at the woman's apartment after Fox thought the woman was seeing another man.

Fox, 33, of Winslow had been drinking when he arrived at his ex-girlfriend's and start banging on the door, according to Winslow Police.

A woman used a pair of nunchucks to keep fight off ex-boyfriend Christopher Fox, 33, of Winslow, Maine.

Fox entered the apartment and refused to leave despite repeated requests by the woman.

Police say the argument grew physical, with Fox throwing the woman against the refrigerator and oven with such force that the appliances were moved from their original locations.

The
woman tried to call 911 on two occasions, according to the Bangor Daily News. However, both times Fox managed to take away her phone away.

Fox reportedly hit the woman with a pull-up bar at one point, according to the Bangor Daily News, but she was able to strike back, grabbing a pair of Karate nunchucks from her living room to fight off Fox.

A Maine woman used karate nunchucks like these pictured to fight off her ex-boyfriend who had allegedly hit with a pull-up bar and threatened her with a knife.

With Fox temporarily stunned by the blow, the woman managed to call police with her phone, Veilleux said.

She had enough time to give police her address before Fox grabbed the phone again and pinned her against the wall.

The woman slipped away from Fox and locked herself in the bedroom.

At this point, Fox grabbed a knife from the kitchen and made threats against himself and the victim.

At some point, police say the
woman managed to escape from the apartment.

Police
soon arrived, and found her bleeding from the mouth.

Fox fled the scene and was tracked down and arrested, Veilleux said. 

He faces charges of aggravated criminal trespass, criminal threatening with a
dangerous weapon, domestic violence assault, criminal mischief and possession
of marijuana, police said.

The woman was taken to the emergency room where she was treated and released for injuries.
