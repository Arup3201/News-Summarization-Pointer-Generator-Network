The ABC is set to face annual budget cuts of about $50 million, which  means the national broadcaster will potentially lose some 500 jobs before Christmas.

Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull is expected to announce within the next week cuts between $200 million and $300 million to both the ABC and SBS.

Mr Turnbull confirmed the ABC's annual funding would be cut by five percent during an appearance on Q&A on Monday night.

The federal government announced a $9 million to the ABC in its May budget.

Mr Turnbull declined to put a dollar figure on the controversial cuts to the national broadcaster, but said they were 'relatively modest'. 

'It's about five per cent of the ABC ... it will average over five years about five per cent off the top,' he said on the ABC's Q&A program on Monday. 

'We're spending more than we are receiving... so we've got to raise some more money and we've got to spend less.

'There is no reason for the ABC and SBS to be exempt from that.' 

Mr Turnbull confirmed the annual funding would be cut by five percent during an appearance on ABC program Q&A on Monday night 

The ABC and SBS both declined to comment on the budget cuts and opted to wait for an official government announcement.  

Mr Turnbull said he would have a lot more to say about the issue later this week, but denied the government was breaking an election promise and maintained savings could be found from administration cuts rather than cuts to programming.

'I have gone to considerable pains to ensure that the ABC is well able to deliver these savings without cutting into the resources available to programming, through cutting back office costs, administrative,' he said.

'Anyone here who has been in business ... that could not manage to find five per cent out of efficiencies is not even trying.'

ABC's Media Watch broke the news on Monday night with sources telling the program cuts would see Friday's state-based 7.30 editions axed, Lateline trimmed back, TV production in SA cut, $6 million will be sliced off ABC radio and bureaus in Tokyo, Bangkok, New Delhi and New Zealand scaled back.

The program said cuts at the ABC will cost between 400 to 500 jobs before the end of the year. 

Oposition communications spokesman Jason Clare accused Mr Turnbull of weasel words.

'They're cutting the guts out of the ABC,' he told ABC TV on Tuesday.

'Julia Gillard was crucified for breaking one promise. Tony Abbott is a serial offender, he's broken every promise he made before the election.'

Mr Clare said any savings from back office efficiencies should be channelled back into the ABC to invest in programs and content.
