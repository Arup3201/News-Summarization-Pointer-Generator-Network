The normally stoic coach of the Newcastle Knights revealed he lost interest in football in the weeks after one of his players Alex McKinnon suffered a devastating spinal injury that ended his career.

Wayne Bennett sat down with the NRL Footy Show's Erin Molan on Thursday night and opened up about the emotional time.

When asked if he ever contemplated ending his coaching career, Bennett takes a deep breath before answering: 'I wasn't interested in football for a couple of weeks.'

Fighting off tears during the interview, the seven-time premiership coach said he cared about his players but 'didn't really care whether we won or lost'.

'Football was still important to me, but it wasn't that important,' he said.

The interview was part of a telethon special to raise money for Newcastle Knights player Alex McKinnon who ended up in a wheelchair after he was tackled during his team's March 24 clash against the Melbourne Storm.

The 'Rise for Alex' campaign is aiming to raise funds for McKinnon's ongoing medical expenses and a league of stars threw their support behind McKinnon - including Australian surfer Mick Fanning, singer Jimmy Barnes, and Sydney Swans players Kieran Jack and Adam Goodes.

Mc Kinnon, 22, was also interviewed by Molan and renewed his vow to walk his fiancee, Teigan Power.

'I love her so much and I always will,' he said.

Four months after the accident, McKinnon described how he felt when he was left lying on the pitch.

'I just wanted to get off the field...and people to stop looking at me,' he said.

And also joked about his time in hospital: 'I was waking up a bit three days after and the surgeon said "you're a very lucky boy Alex" and I said "hmm I don't know about that".'

'Someone always told me that God gives the toughest challenges to his best soldiers and that's the way I'm taking it and the only way you can take it,' he said.

After initially being told he would never walk again, a full recovery is a realistic goal for McKinnon who says he has come to terms with his situation.

McKinnon said he tried to maintain upbeat - focusing on his rehabilitation - but he did have his 'low points'.

'They're pretty bad...[but] it would only be 20 minutes or 30 minutes,' he said.

'Hopefully I can impact on the game another way.'

The interview was particularly emotional for his coach Wayne Bennett who announced last week he would be leaving the side at the end of the season.

He said right off the bat he knew McKinnon's injuries were bad.

'I knew it wasn't good. I didn't want to go back to the replay, I didn't want to look at it,' Bennett told Molan.

'I was very confused with myself, very confused. I didn't feel as emotional as I thought I should and then it dawned on me that I was living a lie and not letting my emotions come through because I couldn’t afford to.

'But I've shed a lot of tears since about him...and I suppose I'll shed some more.

'It's good to get it off my chest.'

He later added during his first live appearance on the Footy Show: 'It's the toughest thing that's happened for me in rugby league.'

Bennett said what he wanted for McKinnon now was for him to be happy.

'I saw a bit of myself [in him] when I was younger,' he said.

'I like his style and how he carried himself and I'm really proud of him.'

Speaking to the media at the launch of the NRL's 'Rise For Alex' round 19 at ANZ Stadium on Monday, he said he was hoping one day soon to resume a normal life.

'As much as I would love to get home and get back to my family and get back to Newcastle and get on with my life, I want to walk again,' McKinnon said on Monday.

'You see a lot of stories about people who get on with their lives and don't walk again. My focus is to get as much back of my movement as I can and I am slowly improving.

'For example, when I first got diagnosed I was a C4 - all that is shoulder movement. Nothing else. No fingers, no movement in your legs, or anything like that.

'I am slowly progressing with the movement, I am a C7 now.'  

Newcastle Knights player Alex McKinnon was tackled by Melbourne Storm players, with his head hitting the ground first and causing severe spinal injuries

McKinnon suffered the devastating spinal injury in March but he promised he would walk his fiancée down the aisle

'It's going to be a slow and long process but I am willing to do that.

'I'm 22 and I'm going to give it my best shot.'

McKinnon says he doesn't remember the round three incident at Melbourne's AAMI Park, only the aftermath of 'the whole ground looking at me'.

'Obviously being thrown into a situation like this you don't know how to handle it but the people around me and their help has really motivated me to get back to the person that I am,' he said.

'There is no point of me being angry. You would think I would be filthy on the world and filthy on the game but I'm not. You may as well be content with the situation.

'What rugby league has done for myself and my life is ridiculous and I wouldn't be the person I am today without it. I wouldn't have met Wayne [Bennett]. I wouldn't have met some of my best mates. I wouldn't change it for anything.'

McKinnon launched the round alongside Knights coach Bennett with teammates Willie Mason, Darius Boyd, Dane Gagai and Korbin Sims looking on.

Bennett said the way McKinnon was dealing with the situation was an inspiration.

'He was very valuable before he was injured and he's more valued now because we all feel his pain,' Bennett said.

'He's a pretty outstanding young man and he's become even more outstanding in my eyes since the accident because he's made sure it has been easier for all of us.

'Despite all the pain and all the grief and all that is in front of him he is more concerned about us and how we feel and when we come to see him he's always putting on a brave face.

'It's remarkable the way he has carried himself.'

A full house is expected at Hunter Stadium on Sunday when the Knights host the Gold Coast.
