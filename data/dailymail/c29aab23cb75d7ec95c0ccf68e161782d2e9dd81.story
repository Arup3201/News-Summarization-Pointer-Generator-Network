A former SAS sniper - known only as Soldier N - believes the Princess of Wales' death was carried out by British special forces

David Cameron and the head of the army, General Sir Peter Wall, both received letters in February containing a claim that the SAS killed Princess Diana – but neither alerted the police to the matter.

Diana, Dodi and their driver were killed when their Mercedes crashed in the Pont de L’Alma underpass in Paris in August 1997.

A former SAS sniper - known only as Soldier N - believes the Princess of Wales' death was carried out by British special forces who then 'covered it up'.

Soldier N claimed driver Henri Paul was blinded by an intense flash of light moments before he lost control of their Mercedes.

The wife of soldier N wrote to the Prime Minister, General Wall and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond, voicing fears that her husband might kill her, according to the Daily Express.

This letter, the paper says, also contained the allegation that the SAS were involved in Diana’s death.

It’s claimed that both No 10, which receives thousands of letters a year, and General Wall wrote back to soldier N’s wife expressing their concern.

A Downing Street official is said to have written: ‘I was sorry to hear of the difficulties you are experiencing. Mr Cameron appreciates you taking the time and trouble to share your concerns.’

It's claimed General Wall wrote: ‘I have been in touch with [soldier N's] regiment to see what measures can be taken to address this situation.’

Neither mentions the allegation about the SAS and Diana’s death, the Express claims.

A Downing Street spokesperson declined to comment on the matter to MailOnline.

The claim about the SAS and Diana's death was brought to the attention of the Army's Service Prosecuting Authority in September 2011, didn't come to the attention of a senior member of the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Army or government until this summer.

A senior defence source told the Daily Express: ‘The handling of this very serious allegation could not have been worse. The question is, was this failure to act due to incompetence or a cover-up?’

However, an MoD spokesperson told MailOnline: ‘We don’t comment on Special Forces matters and as far as we’re concerned it’s a live police investigation, so we wouldn’t comment on it for that reason, too.’

An inquest in 2008 found that Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed were unlawfully killed due to the ‘gross negligence’ of driver Henri Paul, a security manager at the Paris Ritz Hotel, who had been drinking. But the families of Dodi and Mr Paul have long claimed it was a murder. 

Soldier N's credibility has been called into question, with Royal bodyguards and Met experts calling it a  'mystifying stunt' based on 'nonsense' evidence.

He is currently in jail for illegally keeping guns at home, and was described by those who know him as a  'loose cannon'.

As well as hiding weapons in his house, in a 'reign of terror' on his family Soldier N allegedly attacked his son after mistaking him for the Taliban.

Soldier N is also accused of saying he could enlist the help of his colleagues to ensure his wife – the mother of his two children and the woman who defended his theory to police – would ‘disappear’.

His allegations surfaced in a letter linked to the trial of former sniper Danny Nightingale.

The document was written by the mother-in-law of 'Soldier N', Nightingale's housemate, in September 2011 and sent to military prosecutors.

The eight-page correspondence claims Soldier N boasted it was the SAS that had ‘arranged Princess Diana’s death’ and that it had been ‘covered up’.

Sergeant Nightingale, 38, was found guilty last month of illegally possessing a pistol and ammunition at a Hereford house he shared with Soldier N.

Soldier N, who is serving a custodial sentence for possessing firearms at the same address, was originally reported to the police by his wife, from whom he is now separated.

The letter was sent to Soldier N’s commanding officer in September 2011 and passed to the Service Prosecuting Authority before the start of the Nightingale trial.

All references to the SAS were removed by the SPA.

The paragraph referring to the death of Diana says: ‘He also told her (his wife) that it was the XXX who arranged Princess Diana’s death and that has been covered up.’

The letter says Soldier N told his wife there is a ‘box which members of his unit use for private jobs’.

‘They put in the box the name, address and details of what they want done and then one of them who wants to earn extra money does that job.’
