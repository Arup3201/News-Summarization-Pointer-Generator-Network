A woman was arrested after a brawl broke out between dozens of travellers at a bridal reception party.

Police were called twice after trouble flared between guests celebrating in Gravesend, Kent.

Fighting broke out at 11pm on Wednesday in the clubhouse at the 10-acre Elite Venue sports ground.

Neighbours reported hearing shouting and screaming in scenes likened to the flamboyant TV show My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding.

The guests, believed to be Irish travellers, were asked to leave the reception venue after police were called - with dozens of people involved.

The incident began at the 10-acre Elite Venue sports complex in Gravesend, Kent, pictured. Neighbours said they heard shouting and screaming after the brawl broke out on Wednesday night

But two hours later, police were called again to the car park of a nearby Premier Inn, where the guests had moved on.

A 23-year-old woman from Wolverhampton was arrested on suspicion of a public order offence.

It is not known if she was related to the bride or groom. She was held in custody before being released without charge.

A spokesman for the reception venue, which runs corporate events, conferences, weddings, functions and birthday parties, said the bar was closed at 10pm when trouble began.

The spokesman added: 'When we saw things were getting out of hand, the bar was closed and the staff handled the situation well.

'We had our own security there and police were happy with how we dealt with it. We made them aware of what was happening. The incident was contained within the venue.'

Referring to the second call-out, a Kent Police spokesman said: 'We were called around to reports of a disturbance at a hotel in Hever Court Road, Gravesend.

'It was reported groups of guests were shouting and being abusive.'

No one is thought to have been seriously injured.
