Craving a nice, fresh home-cooked meal but too lazy to whip one up yourself?

A new website and app that connects home cooks to hungry people in the same area thinks it has the answer.

Cookisto allows amateur chefs to sell their food to hungry, time-poor people living nearby.

Grubs up: Cookisto, launching in the UK this month, is an app and website that allows amateur cooks to sell their food to hungry people nearby

Launching in the UK this month, Cookisto is already a popular concept in Athens, Greece, where over 12,000 people have signed up to purchase leftover meals for as little as £3 per portion.

The site, which takes a 15 per cent cut from the cook's earnings, is ideal for people looking to earn a little extra cash from leftover meals, as well as budding chefs who want to share their culinary skills.

Anyone can join, as long as chefs sign up to the terms and conditions relating to UK health and safety standards.

'The public is getting accustomed to using collaborative marketplaces,' says Nikki Finnemore, Cookisto’s UK marketing director.

'And you can easily see that a lot of the home chefs who have signed up are legitimate - they run supper clubs or have their own YouTube channels, or a food blog.'

Cook up a storm: The site is ideal for people looking to earn a little extra cash from leftover meals, as well as budding chefs who want to share their culinary skills with the world

On the Athens site, you purchase delights such as boeuf bourguignon and beetroot gnocchi in orange and sage sauce.

The site is also set to launch a bespoke service where you can get your favourite cook to create a particular meal, whether it's a Malaysian curry or canapes for a cocktail party.

Users can then rate cooks and meals, leading to some chefs becoming pretty in-demand.

Prices on the London version will be higher than the Greek version, with meals on sale for around £8.

Food for thought: Users can collect their meal or have it delivered and can then rate a chef after they've sampled their culinary delights

The site is the brainchild of Michalis Gkontas, who came up with the the business plan as part of his Masters degree.

'I had this daily problem of wondering 
what to eat and I saw so many concepts that build platforms and connect 
people and create local markets, and I thought that this idea could 
potentially do really well,' he told The Independent.
