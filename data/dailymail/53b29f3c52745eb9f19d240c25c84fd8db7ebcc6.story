Little Nadia Isle was bullied throughout her young life for being different. 

She was tormented by her peers, who taunted her incessantly for her ears, which protruded from her head further than normal.

But thanks to a charity organisation, Nadia received a transformative surgery that she says has restored her confidence, and for the first time, made her feel beautiful.

Confidence: Nadia Isle, who has been bullied all of her life for her protruding ears, said she felt beautiful after a surgery sponsored by a charity organisation

Point of operation: The Baby Face Foundation paid for Nadia's flight to New York, where surgeons worked to correct her ears, nose, and jawline

Transformation: Speaking to CNN after the procedures, Nadia looked radiant and confident

The charity organisation, Little Baby Face Foundation, was founded by Dr Thomas Romo III, a plastic surgeon with many high-profile clients.

Board member Don Moriarty explained to MailOnline: ‘Dr Romo felt the need on a personal level to utilise his expertise to help transform the lives of children who were facially deformed.’

Nadia’s mother contacted the organisation, which flew her and her daughter to New York City from their home in Georgia, where Nadia was evaluated with a team of specialised surgeons.

CNN’s chief medical correspondent Dr Sanjay Gupta followed Nadia’s story from start to finish. Before the surgery, Nadia told Dr Gupta that the constant bullying ‘hurt so much.’

Because she was made fun of, Nadia stopped socialising and became incredibly withdrawn. She said she was the victim of bullying from first grade and onward.

Her mother told CNN that she had often inquired about surgery, but the sky-high costs made it far beyond their reach.

The four-hour surgery, led by Dr Romo at the Manhattan Eye, Ear, & Throat Institute of the Lenox Hill Hospital system, included pinning Nadia’s ears back and doing corrective work on her jawline.

A partial rhinoplasty was also performed to correct a deviated septum. 

The operation, which was seven years in the making, helped balance out Nadia’s facial features.

The surgical procedures would have cost the Isles an estimated $40,000, but the foundation – which is fuelled solely by donations – picked up the check.

Dr Gupta spoke with Nadia after her initial surgeries, showing a person transformed. Nadia’s deviated septum was corrected, her ears lay flat against her head, and her jawline was more pronounced.

Trail of torment: Nadia said she was bullied starting in first grade, saying classmates would make fun of her looks and ears

‘I look beautiful,’ she had said after the operation.

While in New York, the Baby Face Foundation also paid for Nadia to go to counselling, to help her cope with the years of cruel words from her peers.

According to Mr Moriaty, that is exactly the purpose of the foundation. ‘We like to say that Baby Face transforms the lives of these children and gives them new-found confidence,’ he said.

’They’re able to navigate socially, and not afraid to engage with people.’
