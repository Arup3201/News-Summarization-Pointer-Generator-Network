Jim Davidson has provoked an angry backlash from Big Brother fans after telling a fellow contestant, 'if you were my daughter I'd still be bathing you.'

The former Generation Game host, 60, prompted angry reactions on Twitter by disgusted viewers after making the comments to glamour model Casey Batchelor, 29, during last night's episode.

Many who showed their disbelief on the social media site referred to his arrest by Operation Yewtree detectives last year.

Anger: The 60-year-old comedian made the comments during last night's episode of Celebrity Big Brother

Some fans called the comments 'sick' while one viewer asked 'does anyone have the number for Operation Yewtree.'

One user said: 'So digusting, I would be ashamed', while another said, 'Jim Davidson not doing himself any favours.'

He was arrested in January 2013 by officers working on the national investigation sparked by
 the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal, and re-arrested in March after further 
allegations emerged.

But in December, he was completely cleared of sex assault allegations after prosecutors told said there was insufficient evidence in relation to the claims.

At the time, he said: ‘I’ve always refuted the allegations in both the UK and the Falkland Islands.

The Falklands claim made by a woman dated from the 1980s when Davidson visited to entertain troops.

In August, officers from Scotland Yard told the 60-year-old that he would face no further action after he had spent eight months on bail following his arrest on suspicion of sexual offences.

Odds-on: Despite the comments, the former Generation Game contestant is still favourite to win the show

Critics have claimed Yewtree has become a runaway train, with an ‘arrest first, gather evidence later’ policy. Scotland Yard chiefs insist it is ‘fair and proportionate’.

Despite the comments, the comedian is still favourite to win the reality television contest at 4/11, according to Boylesports.com.

During last night's episode, he was visited by his wife and daughter during a housemate task.

He was left speechless as they both told him how proud they are of him, assuring him everything is okay at home and that he is being missed.

His daughter then insisted he needs to keep up his 'one liners', insisting they're making him 'famous on Twitter'.
