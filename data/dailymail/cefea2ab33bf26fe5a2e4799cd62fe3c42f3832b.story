President Obama has told Americans that they can still sign up for health insurance 'the old fashioned way' to avoid the problem-prone website, but now callers are being greeted by busy signals in spite of the extra staff that have been sent to call centers.

He went on the defensive today during a press conference as he argued that the 'kinks' in the heathcare website need to be ironed out but his administration is pushing for shoppers to sign up online.

'There's no sugar-coating it: the website has been too slow, people have been getting stuck during the application process and no one has been more frustrated by it than me,' President Obama said.

Calming fears: President Obama did his best today to brace the tension that has arisen over the malfunctioning website where Americans are directed to sign up for national health insurance

He stressed that the White House have had 'some of the country's best tech talent join the team' and they are working overtime to help fix the problems.

The website 'hasn't worked as smoothly as it was supposed to work. The
number of people who have visited the site has been overwhelming which has
aggravated some of these existing problems,' Obama said.

Since being elected to office in 2008, President Obama’s administration has prided itself on their tech-savvy ways making the disappointing website a source of embarrassment- and an expensive one at that as it was said to cost $394 million to build.

Though they have been tight-lipped regarding the actual numbers of prospective buyers who have visited the website, today the President revealed that nearly 20 million people have visited the website since it was unveiled on October 1.

Of those visitors, half a million people have successfully put through their applications for insurance, though that means that the number of people who have gotten insurance through those applications is much higher as many of the applications cover multiple people within one family. 

Friendly faces: The President surrounded himself with people who had successfully signed up for health insurance using the Affordable Care Act website

The President's remarks came the same day as healthcare administrators tried to push citizens to sign up for health insurance by phone to avoid using the buggy website.

In addition to the sizable green button prompting visitors to Apply Online, they also now have an option to click on a button suggesting they Apply By Phone.

The button directs users to a 1-800 number that is 'available 24/7'.

That solution does not appear to be a 
solution at all as a number of tests by journalists ended with busy 
signals or dropped calls.

Others
 in the 36 states that have their own state health insurance 
marketplaces are directed to call the individual numbers of those sites.

The same kind of treatment is found on the website, as applicable users are directed to their state's individual website for health insurance sales after typing in their zip code.

'While the website will ultimately be the easiest way to buy insurance, it is not the only way,' President Obama said.

Addressing the problem: Obama said that have had 'some of the country's best tech talent join the team'

Under scrutiny: The Department of Health and Human Services, headed by Kathleen Sebelius, has been criticized for the slow website that cost an estimated $634m to build

He went on to suggest that part of the reason why people have grown so frustrated by the process is because they have 'forgotten what it's like to buy insurance'.

He used the press conference as an opportunity to highlight some success stories, surrounding himself by a crowd of happy customers who waited out the length virtual process but eventually were able to sign up and save money.

He took a minute to chide his Republican colleagues, many who he said have been using their fight against the Affordable Care Act as their sole uniting cause.

'It's time for folks to stop rooting for its failure because hard working middle class families are rooting for its success,' he said.
