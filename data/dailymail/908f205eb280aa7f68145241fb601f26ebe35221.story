'Oh what a grand reunion we shall have at the S. School when you come home. My word, the school will look full and how we shall talk. I wish someone had a camera and could just snap us.'

Sadly for Ethel Gawthorp, her humble dreams would never come true. Instead, her fiance, Walter Shaw, was killed on the Somme on the very day she wrote her touchingly hopeful letter.

The poignant story of Miss Gawthorp, her childhood sweetheart and her last letter to him is one of many heartbreaking stories that emerge from a new collection of wartime correspondence - much of it between lovers and families who would never be reunited.

Poignant: The new book includes letters written by both soldiers and their sweethearts at home

Writing home: British soldiers weren't the only ones to write - this is a German postcard, dated 1916

Although most were written by British soldiers, not every epistle was destined for these shores.

Among the missives unearthed by editor Mandy Kirkby are loving words penned by the spouse of Indian trooper, Prayag Singh, and a love letter written by Austrian Lieutenant Erwin von Freiherr Pflanzer-Baltin to his English sweetheart.

Tragically, like so many of the correspondents, Lieutenant Pflanzer-Baltin was killed just 10 days after writing his letter while fighting in Belorussia on the Eastern Front.

While most of the letters come from ordinary sweethearts, the collection also includes the words of famous names, among them Winston Churchill, whose final goodbye was happily never sent.

Words penned by writer Vera Britten, who immortalised her fiance, Roland Leighton, in Testament of Youth after he was killed in 1915, also appear as does an early letter written by Ernest Hemmingway.

Although Britten and Hemmingway's letters are well-known, the words of the ordinary men and women torn apart by the war are not - but are just as poignant.

Particularly heartbreaking is the goodbye letter written by Gunner Frank Bracey to his sweetheart Win, written while on leave in May 1916, three months before his death.

Tragic: Gunner Frank Bracey's final letter to his sweetheart, Win, is splotched and blurred with tearstains

The note, which is marked by tearstained splotches, is oddly prescient and begins: 'I am writing just a line Win in case of accidents. Just to let you know I have always loved you Dear.

'You are the best little girl on God's Earth have I told you before [sic]. But I am writing this because I have a feeling that I shall not come back again.'

Another letter, written by Sergeant Francis Gautier to his young daughter Marie as he was dying of his wounds in an Essex hospital, expresses some of the bitter grief felt by the soldier fathers who never got to see their children grow up.

In it, Sergeant Gautier writes that he had 'wished to spend many happy years with you' and, poignantly, concludes: 'I am writing because I want you to know in after years how dearly I loved you.'

You can only hope that, unlike so many letters, this was one of the missives that made it through.

Love Letters of the Great War, edited by Mandy Kirby with a foreword by Helen Dunmore, Â£16.99, Pan Macmillan

Grief: Phyllis Iliff wrote of her love to Private Phillip Pemble but he was killed flying for the nascent RAF in 1918

Tragic: Wilfrid Cove kept his daughters' photo in his breast pocket (r). It was found when he was killed in 1917

Nursemaid Amy Handley wrote this letter to her sweetheart Private John George Clifton (Jack) from her Buckinghamshire home in July 1918.

Tragically, Jack, whom she had known since 1913, would become one of the last British casualties of the war when he was killed in action on 21 August 1918.

'Jack - my own - my only love - how I look for your next letter - How much longer shall I have to wait?

Dearheart, I want you - My life - Jack - how changed it is when you are by my side - what different air I seem to breathe into my lungs!

Jack - Jack - Oh! hasten the day - the moment when I shall be by his side again - Jack - my Jack - my same, same heartmate!

Goodnight my love - God bless you my own.

Tuesday Jickie Jock - my own & how today? How you would have smiled if you could have met me up the road today - Yes! you would then.

To have seen me pushing David in his pram to Brayfield all on my own - Jack, if only - but then how can I say, how can I express all that is in my heart?

Does my Jack know? My love, my own, at such moments, Jack, when my love has looked, has seen into the very depths of my soul...

My Jack - My, 'Our' sacred love - when my very soul has been revealed to him - Jack - you know - How it grows and grows!

My heart - surely it will burst! Jack - Jack - I want you - Oh! let me feel you crushing my very life into yours!

Jack - Jack - I live for you - always, always my own. '
