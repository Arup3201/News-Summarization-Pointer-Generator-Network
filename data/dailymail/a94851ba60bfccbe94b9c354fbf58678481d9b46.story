This is the shocking moment  police fired tear gas at a crowd of protesters who were carrying an apparently unconscious woman to safety during violent clashes in Ferguson on Monday night. 

The group was captured on video dragging the collapsed woman toward heavily-armored officers in the St Louis suburb, while screaming: 'She's having a heart attack, she's having a heart attack!'

When they reached the line of police shields, they continued to beg, 'She needs help, she needs help just get her', to which one officer replied: 'Let her go, back up, we will get her.'

But seconds later, police suddenly threw a tear gas canister into the crowd - causing protesters to cover their faces and flee - before firing rubber bullets and reportedly deploying stun grenades.

Concern: A group of protesters is seen carrying an apparently unconscious woman (pictured, in a pink hat) toward armored officers in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson, while screaming: 'She's having a heart attack'

Asking for help: When they reached the line of police shields, the demonstrators continued to shout: 'She's having a heart attack!' (pictured), before telling officers 'She needs help, she needs help just get her'

Response: One officer, donning a gas mask and holding a gun, replied: 'Let her go, back up, we will get her'

As plumes of smoke filled the air, the woman was apparently laid on the ground as a young man could be heard shouting: 'That's my momma!'. The woman's condition remains unknown.

The incident, filmed by Fusion-affiliated journalist Tim Pool, occurred just hours after the grand jury's decision not to indict officer Darren Wilson in the Michael Brown shooting case was announced.

Earlier in the evening, St Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch had declared the jury found that 'no probable cause exists' to indict Wilson in the shooting on August 9 in Ferguson.

The dramatic Fusion footage was later uploaded to the TV channel's YouTube page, where it was branded 'mindless', 'heartless' and 'unbelievable' by some users.

Tear gas: Seconds after the officer's comment, police threw a tear gas canister into the crowd, causing protesters to cover their faces and flee, before firing rubber bullets and reportedly deploying flashbangs

Distraught: As plumes of smoke filled the air, the woman was apparently laid on the ground as a young male demonstrator (pictured protecting his face from the tear gas) could be heard shouting: 'That's my momma!'

However, others pointed out that the police seemingly directed the tear gas and rubber bullets at a number of protesters behind the group carrying the woman. 

On Tuesday, Wilson broke his months-long silence to say his conscience is clear and he does not think he could have done anything differently on the night he shot the unarmed black 18-year-old.

In a preview, ABC's George Stephanopoulos told viewers that he spent more than an hour with Wilson in a 'secret location' within 24 hours of the grand jury's verdict.

He said Wilson told him that he is 'sorry' for the death of Brown, but that he was only doing what he was trained to do, has a clear conscience and would not do 'anything differently' 

Some 61 people were arrested in Ferguson on Monday night and the early hours of Tuesday, mainly for burglary and trespassing, St Louis County Police spokesman Brian Schellman said. 

Meanwhile in St Louis, there were 21 arrests, according to mayor Francis Slay, where some protesters broke windows of businesses.

Violent clashes: At least one man died in the night of arson, looting, random gunfire and pitched battles. Above, a protestor poses for a 'hands up' photo in front of a burning building on West Florissant Avenue, Ferguson

At least one man died in a night of arson, looting, random gunfire and pitched battles, with heavily armed riot police unable to cope with the scale of the mayhem.

As violence flared and Brown's mother collapsed in tears, President Barack Obama appeared on television to appeal for calm, saying 'there is no excuse for violence'.

However, he said anger was an 'understandable reaction' from people who believe 'the law is being applied in a discriminatory fashion,' a reference to Wilson being white and Brown being black.
