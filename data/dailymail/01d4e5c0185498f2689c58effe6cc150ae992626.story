This is the dramatic moment a tram carrying passengers stopped just yards from hitting a car stuck on the line.

This picture was taken just seconds before the tram driver managed to avoid crashing into the red Toyota.

It is thought the car driver had mistaken the section of line, which runs from Oldham to Rochdale, for a side road.

As he drove along the line the car became stuck on a sunken section, wedging him between the tracks.

A tram which was heading from Shaw towards Oldham at the same time, managed to stop after spotting the car's headlights, avoiding a serious incident.

Police arrived at the scene shortly after along with a recovery truck and managed to free the vehicle from the line.

The driver was not injured but appeared shaken by the ordeal that happened on Christmas Eve.

The tram driver said: 'I saw the car as I came round the bend and managed to stop in time after spotting the car's headlights facing me.'

It was the second time in as many days a car became wedged on the tracks at Mumps, Oldham.

Tram passengers were also stranded for up to an hour after a motorist drove on to the track on December 23.

The car was left stuck with damaged tyres after the driver turned on to the Oldham-Shaw line at around 5pm, close to the A62 Bottom o’th Moor and Brook Street junction.

Transport for Greater Manchester suspended services and trams were left queuing behind the car, which triggered the track’s safety device. Services resumed after the vehicle was towed away, Oldham News reports.
