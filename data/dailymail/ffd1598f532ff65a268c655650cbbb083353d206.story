When Aly Femia asked doctors when she should get married so her sick mother could be there for the big day, they answered: 'Tomorrow.'

So she did.

Aly’s mom, Mary Quinn, had gone to check up on a pain she felt in her neck less than two weeks ago.

Little did anyone expect the diagnosis to come back as lung cancer, which had spread to her brain.

After initially hoping there were treatment options, Mary and her family were told her condition was incurable, according to BuzzFeed.

She now only has a short time left to live.

Aly Femia was married at Vale New Haven Hospital on Wednesday January 29 after her mother was suddenly diagnosed with incurable cancer

Mom Mary Quinn was able to see every part of the ceremony from her hospital bed

Aly and Anthony Femia managed to pull together their wedding in 24 hours, much to the credit of staff at Yale New Haven Hospital

The ceremony was officiated by the hospital chaplain

Mother-of-the-bride: Aly's mom, Mary Quinn, went to the doctors for a neck pain last week and was told she had lung cancer that had spread to her brain

Aly met her boyfriend, Anthony, at Greenwich High School in Connecticut.

In December 2012, Anthony proposed to her during a weekend getaway.

They celebrated their engagement with friends and family and were originally supposed to get married in September 2015.

Despite the short notice, Aly wasn't prepared to walk down the aisle without her mother present.

So in 24 hours they planned a wedding.

The nuptials were held at a room in Yale New Haven Hospital, with Mary able to watch from her bed.

Aly said she could not have thanked the hospital staff enough for the help they did, with one doctor even offering to take her wedding dress shopping.

The couple were engaged in December 2012 after meeting in high school

Having celebrated their engagement with family and friends, the pair had originally planned to wed in 2015

Doctors say that Mary Quinn does not have long to live. She is seen here in a family photo with her daughter Aly

Aly's father died 16 years ago from metastatic cancer, making the wedding even more important and poignant

The hospital chaplain officiated the ceremony and staff organized the food, flowers and cake.

Some staff even chipped in to buy Aly a bracelet that she wore on the day.

'The hospital was incredible!' Aly told Buzzfeed.

'They made my wedding possible.'

Aly was walked down the aisle by her stepfather.

Her own father died of metastatic cancer 16 years ago.

'Maybe that’s why it was even more important to me to have one of my parents at my wedding,' she explained.

Aly was walked down the aisle by her stepfather, who she said: 'Loves me like a daughter.'

She said the best part of the day was knowing her mother was watching and being able to wear her pearls

Aly described her groom, Anthony, as her best friend

The food, flowers and even the cake were arranged by staff at the hospital

Family and friends gathered for the ceremony with just 24 hours notice

'My favorite part of the day was having my mom see me in my wedding dress wearing a string of her pearls, and seeing her smile.

'I’m so glad that she was there to watch me say ‘I do’ and see me marry my best friend.

'I couldn’t have asked for a more perfect day.

'We have a beautiful family, and no matter what happens we’re all going to stick together.'
