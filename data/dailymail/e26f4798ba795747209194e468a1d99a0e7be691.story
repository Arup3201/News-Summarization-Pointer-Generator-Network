Baby Vale weighed in at 8.5lbs and mother and the newborn are doing well, Guthrie's Today show colleagues reported on Thursday after tweeting this adorable picture

The girl's full name is Vale Guthrie Feldman, according to an email sent by Savannah's husband and proud new dad Mike Feldman.

He retweeted Savannah's tweet, adding: 'This sound is like music to my ears.'

Mr Feldman, 45, was by Savannah's side when she gave birth. The political consultant and the TV presenter married on March 15 this year in Tucson, Arizona. They announced at their wedding reception that Savannah was pregnant with her first child. 

Today reported: 'At the moment, she has blue eyes, a little bit of blondish hair and the chubbiest cheeks you've ever seen.' 

Savannah sent a message adding: 'The baby is more cheek than baby at the moment.'

The name Vale is taken from an old English word meaning 'valley by a stream', anchor Matt Lauer shared with viewers.

Lauer said: 'They named her that because she was so calm and so serene until ten o'clock last night.

'I actually talked to Savannah and Mike on the phone last night and the baby was fussing a little bit and she said ''but she was so peaceful!'''

He added: 'They are over, overjoyed and everybody is doing great.'

Lauer said that he had then been texting with Savannah on Wednesday when she suddenly she went quiet. After a probing text, Savannah replied with a text of a baby's foot.

Today host Natalie Morales told viewers on Thursday she had spoken to Savannah and that although her friend only had one hour of sleep, she was on 'cloud nine'.

Guthrie said she was 'on cloud nine' after the birth of her gorgeous baby girl Vale Guthrie Feldman

The morning show anchor tweeted this cryptic message in the early hours of Thursday leading to a rush of messages from fans asking if she had given birth 

Viewers and colleagues rushed to tweet their congratulations about the happy news.

Rival morning show GMA tweeted: 'Big cheers to @SavannahGuthrie - welcome to the world baby Vale! #CongratsSavannah.'

CNBC anchor Carl Quintanilla posted: 'Now, THAT'S a welcome. #congratsSavannah ;-) @TODAYshow 

Eun Yang, morning anchor at NBC Washington, tweeted: 'So happy for you @SavannahGuthrie and @feldmike! Welcome to your beautiful baby girl Vale! What a blessing! #CongratsSavannah'

Dateline anchor Lester Holt tweeted: 'Welcome Vale! Guess who's trending today and EVERYDAY in her moms eye? #CongratsSavannah' 

Savannah had just started maternity leave on Monday, around one week away from her due date. 

NBC has not revealed who will fill in for Savannah while she is away learning the ropes of first time motherhood. 

In May, NBC News president Deborah Turness said in a statement to The New York Times: 'Savannah has been such a big part of the Today show’s momentum over the last few months.

'While she’s with her newborn we’ll keep that momentum going with our own homegrown talent with perhaps a few surprises mixed in.'

The delighted Today show team posted this picture at the start of Thursday's show as they shared Savannah's happy news with viewers

Savannah had been a sharing intimate details of her journey with viewers on air and via her Today.com blog since she first announced her surprise pregnancy in March; and has gladly relaxed into her growing size of late.

Last month, she finally ditched the heels and appeared on her live segment wearing sneakers. 

'Unbutton those jeans and glory in the elastic waistband,' she wrote on her blog. 'There is no point in sucking in your stomach, or squeezing into a dress, or trying to look good in a bathing suit.'

Opening up about the sacred connection she has with her unborn child, following a long struggle with fertility issues leading up to it, she wrote in May: 'The baby is the first thought when I wake up, and the last thought as I sink into slumber at night. 

'I whisper little encouragements to the baby: "You’re doing a great job growing up!" or "I’m so happy you’re here!"'

'I pray for the baby. I sing to him/her. I wonder about the baby constantly: ''What are you up to? Are you sleeping right now? Are you awake? How do you feel about the Indian food we had for dinner?'''
