Demarai Gray should only leave Birmingham City for a team challenging the Champions League places, Gary Rowett believes.

Birmingham have rejected three bids from Championship rivals Bournemouth – the latest of £3million rising to £3.5m in add-ons – and top-flight clubs are interested.

‘He’s a fantastic talent,’ said Rowett. ‘I think he’s best served being here until an opportunity comes his way that is befitting of his talent. For me at the moment it’s only probably a top four team that can do that. That’s not being disrespectful to anyone else.’

A report on Sky Sports News suggested Gray was inclined to leave the club, but Rowett insisted that desire had never been communicated to him.

Gray began Birmingham’s 2-1 FA Cup defeat to West Bromwich Albion on the bench but was sent on with 20 minutes to go to provide a genuine spark.

He brought two fine saves from Ben Foster with driven shots – one from long range – and would only have enhanced his reputation.

Explaining his decision to omit Gray from the starting line-up, Rowett said: ‘One of the biggest things, this was before the morning’s comment on TV, I just felt it has been a big month for him.

‘A lot of speculation, a big game, and I wondered whether it might be a little bit too much for an 18 year old. I just felt t would be nice to get him out of limelight for a little bit, and that his pace and trickery might be best served as impact later on in the game.

‘I’ve had lots of conversations with him recently, he’s never once told me he’s keen on leaving the club, I just think it’s one or two people trying to stir things up. He’s our player, I hope he stays.

‘I’m not too worried about any speculation. I prefer to concentrate on his performance when he came on. He showed what he’s all about.’
