This is the moment a foul-mouthed police officer pulled his gun on a group of teenagers - reportedly because they were having a snowball fight.

The officer, filmed walking from a patrol car, shouts 'don't f*****g move, guys!' at the group of six people standing at a snowy intersection.

He demands they get down on their knees, and frisks one while pointing his gun towards the others, in footage thought to have been recorded in New Rochelle, New York, this week.

Aggressive: The cop, thought to be responding to reports of a snowball fight in New Rochelle, New York, has the group of six youths kneel, and frisks at least one

The video, made of two shorter clips stitched together, later shows the officer asking the group to stand up, and seemingly lets them go.

The woman recording the footage then says: 'They were having a snowball fight - This group of guys was having a snowball fight and now a cop has a gun on them.'

New Rochelle's police department has so far refused to comment on the video. 

According to New Rochelle news blog Talk of the Sound, local sources confirmed that the officer was called to reports of a snowball fight.

En masse: The officer drew his gun on the group of six, reportedly on Wednesday in the wake of winter storm Juno

The footage shows two police cars, though only one officer can be seen in the clip.

Talk of the Sound reported that the incident probably happened on Wednesday, in the wake of winter storm Juno, and was around the Lincoln Avenue area of New Rochelle.

When contacted by DailyMail.com, the New Rochelle Police Department said it would not comment or release any information on the video until Monday.
