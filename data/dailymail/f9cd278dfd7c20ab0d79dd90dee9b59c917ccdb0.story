She's made it through a very public divorce with a smile on her face, so when Miranda Kerr offers life advice, we're all ears.

The former Victoria's Secret supermodel, who has penned two self-help books, shared her wisdom with Lucky magazine.

Speaking about what she'd tell her younger self now if she had the chance, Miranda said: 'Just enjoy every day; don't sweat the small stuff. Stay grounded, stay true to yourself and follow your own intuition.'

The 31-year-old, who is mother to Orlando Bloom's son Flynn, also shared her top summer tips.

Miranda cites her favourite summer song as Here Comes The Sun by The Beatles, because it reminds her of 'a little trip I took with some friends and we had the music playing and the sun was shining and it was really good energy and vibes'.

The exercise enthusiast also revealed that her favourite summertime activity is swimming in the ocean.

'It feels so good,' she said. 'Just diving into the ocean and floating on my back. '

She added: 'I fight jet-lag by drinking lots of 
water and when I get off the plane, I try to get a little bit of 
sunshine on my face and put my feet in the grass because I find it 
re energises me and it's very grounding.'

Good
 nutrition is also an integral part of her life and she regularly preaches about the power of superfoods.

Miranda tries to 
keep sugar and wheat out of her daily diet but does indulge in them once
 in a while and sticks to a diet high in vegetables, meat, fruit and 
nuts with her favourite summer holiday snack being fresh papaya with squeezed lemon and lime.

The fashionista, who has fronted countless fashion campaigns, says her go-to summer outfit is a vintage summer maxi dress and when looking for a bikini, she maintains that it's important to find a shape that works for your body type and have fun with prints and colour.

'I love a one-piece, it's super sexy but a two-piece is better for a tan,' she adds.

While she's remaining coy about her own love life, Miranda, who cites Audrey Hepburn and Jane Birkin has her fashion and beauty icons, added: 'I feel that the best thing to wear on a first date is something that you feel comfortable and confident in so something that makes you feel good. I feel like that's attractive.'
