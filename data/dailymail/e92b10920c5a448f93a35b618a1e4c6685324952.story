Sacked coach Jagoba Arrasate insists he is departing Real Sociedad with a clear conscience even though he leaves with the team stuck in the Primera Division relegation zone and already out of Europe.

Arrasate was handed his marching orders on Sunday night following a miserable start to the season that has seen Sociedad pick up just six points from a possible 30 in La Liga.

That has left the Basque club - who finished fourth in 2013 and seventh last term - in 19th place in the standings and two points from safety ahead of next weekend's daunting visit of champions Atletico Madrid.

Sociedad were also knocked out of the Europa League before the group stages following a humiliating defeat to Russian side Krasnodar in August.

Nevertheless, Arrasate, who enjoyed a decent first season in charge last term having previously been a youth team coach and then a first-team assistant to his predecessor Philippe Montanier at the Anoeta, feels he can leave with his head held high.

He said at a press conference on Monday: 'I'm sad to be going, but with a clear conscience.

Arrasate admitted being upset over leaving Sociedad with the club stuck in the relegation zone in La Liga

'I understand the board's decision, they maintained their confidence in me until the last moment. What hurts me most is to leave La Real in this situation. I will be relieved when the team is much higher.

'I've been proud to have been coach of La Real, it's been a privilege

'There were a lot of demands after the fourth-place finish, last year I think things went well, despite the bitter-sweet end to the season, and this season things haven't gone as we hoped.'

Former Manchester United boss David Moyes has been linked with the Real Sociedad post

Former Manchester United boss David Moyes has been linked with the vacancy, along with ex-West Brom and Real Betis boss Pepe Mel.

On the subject of his successor, Arrasate said: 'I'm sure that whoever comes in will be well prepared and I wish them the best. I believe in this squad, the key thing is that the team needs to loosen up and recover their confidence and their football.

'I think that the new person can do that. There is the potential here to be much much higher.'
