His internationally renowned Clean & Lean diet has picked up a host of celebrity fans, from supermodels Elle Macpherson and David Gandy, to actor Hugh Grant and Victoria's Secret model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

And now fitness guru-to-the-stars James Duigan has updated and re-released his healthy living plan for everyone on Kindle this month, promising to banish yo-yo dieting forever and give you the streamlined body of which you've always dreamed.

Duigan has filmed a series of exclusive exercise videos, each targeting a specific problem area - just for Femail readers. Last week he revealed how to get the abs you really want, and this week, it's all about lovely legs.

British model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is a staunch supporter of James Duigan's Clean & Lean diet plan

In today's short video, Duigan reveals three exercises which he promises will give you perfect pins.

The disco lunge is his favourite exercise. It's also the favourite of supermodels the world over. Great for posture, great fat burner, engages tummy and tones legs. Stand tall with thumbs up - a fab way to engage deep postural muscles - as you lunge forward throw arms back.

The drop lunge is a great way of stretching through the hip and working the bottom at different angles which keeps your body guessing and burns more fat. It's also great for stability and keeping your joints healthy and safe. Make sure you keep your tummy engaged and your hips stay facing forward.

The single leg Romanian dead lift is not as scary as it sounds. It is brilliant for improving stability and toning the bottom. Maintain perfect posture throughout and keep your tummy drawn in so that your spine stays safe.

The three exercises are easy-to-do and can be carried out anywhere at any time.

Rosie Huntington-Whiteley
has been following the Clean & Lean plan for years, and David Gandy is also a fan

And although it's loved by supermodels, 
Victoria's Secret girls and film stars, Duigan says that the real magic 
is that is can work for anyone, from housewives to office workers - and 
everyone in between.

Huntington-Whiteley met James several years 
ago and is such a fan that she penned the introduction to his book Clean
& Lean: Flat Tummy Fast.

Rosie said: 'James knows exactly how I want my body to look: lean, taut and strong, yet soft, curvy and feminine.

'What
I've learned through working with James is that by focusing on creating
a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things, faster than I
ever thought possible.'

James Duigan's Clean & Lean plan is loved by supermodels and anyone who wants to detox and tone up

The
diet has never been advertised, but those who follow it (and who follow
Duigan's workouts, which he teaches from his London gym Bodyism, 
recently voted as best in the business by Tatler) become enthusiastic to
the point of fanaticism, making the Clean & Lean plan popular 
through word of mouth alone.

It recommends you rely on natural, nutritious foods to 
give you energy rather than a roller coaster of unnatural highs provided
by sugar and caffeine, that invariably end in a crash that will 
have you reaching for the next stimulant, whether that be coffee, carbs,
sweets or wine. That means, yes, ditch the booze.

Go for fresh food, as close to
its natural state as possible - no refined sugar, which Duigan describes
as like a 'toxic fat bomb' for your waistline.

Cut back caffeine
to one cup of coffee in the morning, which will help to banish cellulite.

The revised and updated Clean & Lean plan can be downloaded onto Kindles or iPhones and iPads using the Kindle app.
