A Jetstar employee has lashed out at passengers  affected by Saturday's flight delays, calling them 'a bunch of whingers' and 'nuts freaking about delays'.

In a Facebook comment, the budget carrier's staff member, Emily Capewell, blamed passengers who were affected by a computer glitch which caused delays of up to 90 minutes on one of the busiest travel days of the year.

'Obviously don't travel enough. Happens to everyone and today it's jetstars day,' Ms Capewell wrote on the Sydney Morning Herald's Facebook page, which has since been deleted.

'You are all a bunch of whingers! Grow up and think about the people that are working today and have to deal with all you nuts freaking about delays!'

Jetstar employee Emily Capewell lashed out at passengers on social media on Saturday, calling them 'nuts freaking about delays' who need to grow up. 

The Jetstar staffer complained about painful passengers on the Sydney Morning Herald Facebook page this morning, as flights were delayed because of a computer glitch on one of the busiest travel weekends of the year

The airline had an IT outage overnight which caused issues for flights from early Saturday morning, a spokesman told AAP. 

More than 60,000 Jetstar passengers' Christmas travel plans were affected across the country. 

A Jetstar spokesman told SMH the company was in the process of contacting Ms Capewell, adding 'these comments are inappropriate and don't reflect the views of Jetstar or our employees.'

The problem has now been fixed but passengers experienced delays of between 60 to 90 minutes throughout the morning.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, a different Jetstar employee said the system was beginning to come back online earlier today, but delays were to be expected.

A Jetstar spokesperson apologised for the disruptions and urged passengers to check their flight status on the company's website.

'We've experienced delays this morning across the Australia and New Zealand network as a result of an IT outage. Flights have been delayed by 60 to 90 minutes.

'Our systems are now coming back online and flights have departed this morning. Please check your flight status on our website.'

'We apologise for the disruption these delays have caused.'

Qantas, who is a partner airline of Jetstar, was not affected by the outage.  

However, it is not clear whether the airline has yet reviewed its flight plans. 

Disgruntled passengers took to social media to express their anger at the airline

Russ M told passengers that they should have used Virgin or Qantas as Jetstar is a budget airline 

Sydney Airport released a statement, urging people to allow plenty of time to travel to the airport, as this is one of the busiest weekends in Sydney. 

'Jetstar is experiencing delays across the Australia and NZ network this morning as a result of an IT outage impacting operations,'

'This is a very busy weekend at the airport - please allow plenty of time for your journey.' 

Tim Roxburgh took to Twitter to reveal that his flight departed two hours behind schedule

Frustrated passengers were told to expect up to 90 minutes delays today 

Outraged passengers took to social media to express their frustration at the outage.

Stephen Oxley said: 'Flight delayed? This is so unlike you Jetstar'

Mary Beretov took to Facebook to lay into the budget airline.  

The IT system failure has lead to chaos at airports across the country

Passengers were urged to check the company's website before making their way to the airport 

'Shame Jetstar with your domestic flights so many times you provide excuses and no proper communication with your customers...,, not good enough by lowering your prices you also lower you care,' she said. 

Another disgruntled passenger Daisy seemed distraught at the airline's delays. 

'The only time I need a Jetstar flight the whole system crashes and everythings delayed' she said.
