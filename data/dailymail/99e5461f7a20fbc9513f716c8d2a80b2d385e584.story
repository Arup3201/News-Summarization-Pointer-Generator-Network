Revealed: Britain had a role in the 1984 massacre at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, pictured

David Cameron pleaded with the Sikh community to forgive the Tories last night after an inquiry found the Thatcher government advised India on how to attack a Sikh temple.

He ordered the inquiry by Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood after papers released under the 30-year rule exposed the British role last month.

It found that an SAS officer was sent to brief the Indian army in 1984 on launching a surprise special forces dawn raid against the Golden Temple in Amritsar, which had been seized by Sikh rebels.

But the advice was ignored and Indira Gandhi’s government instead launched a frontal assault – codenamed Operation Blue Star - which became a massacre in which up to 3,000 people were killed.

Foreign Secretary William Hague told MPs the SAS advice had a ‘limited impact’ on the raid, which led to an official death toll of 575 and claims that 3,000 people 
perished in the crossfire, and that there was ‘no record’ of the British
 government receiving advance notice of the operation.

He told MPs 
the SAS assessment ‘made clear that a military operation should only be 
put into effect as a last resort’ and recommended that any military 
operation use ‘an element of surprise and the use of helicopter-borne 
forces in the interest of reducing casualties and bringing about a swift
 resolution’.

But British Sikhs last night voiced concerns, demanding a full public inquiry.

Dabinderjit Singh, of the Sikh Federation UK, said Britain’s involvement was clear, adding: ‘We are actually very disappointed with the announcement today.’

Mr Cameron said he wanted the dialogue between the Government and the Sikh community to continue, adding: ‘British Sikhs have made – and continue to make – a vital contribution to our national life.

'Thirty years ago, a great tragedy unfolded...in Amritsar. Many lives were lost and the scars in the Sikh community still run deep.

‘I tasked the Cabinet Secretary with getting to the truth. He did so, and there are two main findings.

‘One: around four months before the 
events, at the request of the Indian Government, a single UK military 
officer provided some advice. But critically, this advice was not 
followed, and it was a one-off.

Anger: Lord Indarjit Singh said Mr Hague's statement was 'smug and condescending'

‘Two: there is absolutely no evidence of UK Government involvement in the operation itself.’

The Prime Minister travelled to Amritsar last year to visit the temple - a trip that appeared to have led to a rise in Conservative support among British Sikhs, who are a key voting bloc in marginal constituencies in London and the Midlands.

His efforts are seen by many to have been dashed by the new revelations.

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said 'serious questions' remained, adding: ‘The pain and suffering still felt by many about the tragic events of 1984 places a particular duty on the Government to provide what answers it can to address very genuine concerns.’

Lord Indarjit Singh, director of the Network of Sikh Organisations, called Mr Hague’s statement ‘smug and condescending’ and said the language in the documents was ‘insulting’ to Sikhs since it suggested they were all extremists.

On the claim that UK advice had a ‘limited impact’ of the Golden Temple attack, Lord Singh said: ‘It is like saying that I had only a minimal involvement in a massacre or a holocaust.’

Jasvir Singh, director of the City Sikhs Network, which represents Sikh professionals in the UK, said the information disclosed in the review ‘harks back to colonial times’.

He added: ‘I think there are lots of people in the Sikh community who are upset that the British could be involved in this, even to a limited extent.’
