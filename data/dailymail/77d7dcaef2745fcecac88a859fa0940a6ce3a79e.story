Luke Shaw became Manchester United's 40th injury of the season on Saturday evening, but Louis van Gaal was still able to have the last laugh after a 2-1 victory against Arsenal.

United entered the game with five defensive absentees - the inexperienced pair of Paddy McNair and Tyler Blackett were part of a back-five - and Shaw made it six when he had to be substituted after just 16 minutes. 

Despite their problems, the visitors went on to win 2-1, and Van Gaal admitted he was very happy with his first away win as manager of Manchester United.

'It's a fantastic victory at the right moment,' Van Gaal told Sky Sports. 'We have a lot of injuries, but in spite of that we win. They are a very attacking team and I knew that in advance. 

'That's why I have chosen this strategy. At the end I can laugh.'

When asked if it was a big result for him and the team, Van Gaal said no, citing two huge home games against Hull and Stoke as the important fixtures.

'No, we have to wait and see. It's the first away victory, so the players were very excited in the dressing room. But it's only one victory. We have to win two more at home. Then we can say, "okay, we have the spirit now."'
