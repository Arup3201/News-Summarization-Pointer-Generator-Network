Former dictator Hosni Mubarak appeared red-eyed and frail but nonetheless defiant as he appeared locked inside a caged dock in an Egyptian courtroom today.

The 86-year-old, dressed in a blue prison uniform and sitting on a hospital stretcher, denied ordering the killing of hundreds of protesters during the 2011 revolt that dethroned him.

Instead, in his first lengthy statement to the court as his retrial draws to an end, he described his 29-year reign as one that stabilised Egypt - a theme he previously drew on in his final days in power.

'Hosni Mubarak speaking to you today would never order the killing of protesters or shedding the blood of Egyptians,' Mubarak said.

'I voluntarily chose to give up my responsibility as president to prevent bloodshed and to preserve national unity, for Egypt not to slip into a dangerous path toward the unknown,' he said.

Mubarak was found guilty in June 2012 of failing to stop the killing of over 900 protesters during the 18-day uprising and was sentenced to life imprisonment, but his conviction was overturned in January 2013.

That decision was appealed by prosecutors, and a retrial began in April 2013.

Standing trial alongside Mubarak was his security chief, Habib el-Adly, convicted and sentenced to life in prison on the same charges, as well as six of el-Adly's top aides.

All six were acquitted in the earlier trial. The final verdict will be issued on September 27, the judge said.

Retrial: Mubarak was found guilty in June 2012 of failing to stop the killing of over 900 protesters during the 18-day uprising and was sentenced to life imprisonment, but his conviction was overturned in January 2013 

In the first days of the 'Arab Spring' uprising that overthrew Egypt's U.S.-backed military regime, protesters stormed police stations across the country after officers responded to demonstrations with deadly force.

Nearly 200 policemen and security officials were subsequently put on trial, but all were acquitted either for lack of evidence or under the pretext that the police acted in self-defence.

The acquittals became a cornerstone of Mubarak's defence strategy.

Mubarak said that the 2011 protests began peacefully but were taken over by 'exploiters of religion inside and outside the country' who steered the demonstrations toward violence.

It was the same language often used by Mubarak-era media men and officials to refer to the Muslim Brotherhood, whose leader Mohammed Morsi became Mubarak's successor in the country's only ever free elections in 2012.

A year later, the military overthrew Morsi after millions staged demonstrations against him demanding his resignation for what they called abuse of power.

The government branded the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist group and unleashed a deadly crackdown against its supporters, who staged near daily rallies demanding Morsi's return to power.

Hundreds were killed and thousands jailed on violence-linked charges. Morsi himself faces charges that carry the death sentence.

The Brotherhood is preparing for mass demonstrations on Thursday to commemorate the anniversary of the violent dispersal of pro-Morsi sit-ins.

Human Rights Watch accused authorities of using lethal force and said the killings amount to crimes against humanity, which the government angrily rejected.
