Like a leaking roof, it was always going to get worse. With Shane Long transferring from Hull to Southampton for £12million, the ceiling has finally caved in.

This is the summer when transfer spending escalated from mildly crazy to pants-on-the-head bonkers.

The Premier League has always had big deals and strange transfers, but this summer looks set to break the mark of £630m spent ahead of the 2013-14 campaign, which in turn bettered the £500m record established in 2008.

Staggering: Shane Long joined Southampton from Hull for £12million in August

Value for money? Long (centre) scored four league goals in 17 appearances for Hull last season

With the Premier League's £5.5bn media deal, it should come as no surprise. But some of the individual transactions have made for incredible viewing.

Long, of course, is a good forward. When he joined Hull from West Brom for £7m seven months ago it was a bargain. But to add £5m to the 27-year-old’s value after four goals in 17 games is extreme.

A player’s value, as they say, is like the value of a house – it’s all about how much someone is willing to pay. Southampton’s number of departures this season meant their necessity for players was perhaps greater than most, with the world knowing how much cash was stuffed under their mattress.

They, in turn, have benefited from that market this summer. Luke Shaw going to Manchester United for £30m is a staggering transaction. The fact Shaw is a talented left back of excellent promise is not in doubt. But the amount paid by United has raised eyebrows across the game.

As Huw Jenkins, the Swansea chairman, told a supporters’ forum on Thursday night: ‘Southampton have probably overpaid to get Shane Long. Obviously they need to bring in players because they're selling them. As they're getting big fees in for their players, they are, in my opinion, overpaying to bring players back in.’

After raising a reported £97.6m from selling players, Southampton have since spent a reported £9m on Graziano Pelle, £10.9m for Dusan Tadic, £7m for Florin Gardos, £12m for Long and £10m for Fraser Forster. Ryan Bertrand has come in on loan.

But this summer has been about far more than Southampton. To replace Long, Hull are understood to be considering a £10m move to sign Troy Deeney, from Championship club Watford.

Deeney is also a fine player. He scored 24 league goals last season, with four assists, and returned 19 goals in 2012-13. He has one goal from one game for this campaign. But this move would rate him just outside the top 10 of Britain’s most expensive strikers in history – territory already reached by Ross McCormack, who moved to relegated Fulham from Leeds for £11m this summer.

Massimo Cellino, the Leeds chairman, reacted to the offer like this: ‘Ross McCormack is a beautiful player. I didn’t come to Leeds to sell Ross McCormack. But for him I was nothing, a new owner, he’s got a lot of money from Fulham, the chance to live in London. What can I say? I love you McCormack, stay with me?

‘He doesn’t give a f***. He didn’t show up to training. He didn’t fly with the club to pre-season. I was so p***** off that when Fulham called me I asked them for £10m to make them not buy the player. They said yes! Bloody hell.’

That deal falls outside of the Premier League, but that in itself highlights the situation.

In context, in January 2013, Daniel Sturridge was transferred from Chelsea to Liverpool for £12m. By then he was an England international with the added premium of being homegrown and having more than a year on his contract; by now he is one of the country’s brightest lights and younger than McCormack, Deeney and Long.

Perhaps the biggest surprise was David Luiz, a player that never seemed to have the full confidence of Jose Mourinho, was still able to attract an accepted offer of £50m from PSG.

Mad, bonkers or whatever Cellino might say.

The window doesn’t close for two and a half weeks. Who knows what will happen next?
