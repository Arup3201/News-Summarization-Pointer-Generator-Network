For years, the more energy-conscious among us have habitually switched off lights in empty rooms and made sure televisions are never left on stand-by.

But it appears these daily efforts to cut ever-rising bills could be in vain as our increasing reliance on electronic gadgets means we are consuming more electricity than five years ago.

As a result, Britain will miss its 2020 domestic appliance carbon reduction target by seven million tons, a report by the Energy Saving Trust warned today.

Hi-tech home: Large plasma-screen TVs, tumble dryers and fridge-freezers, particularly those with an ice-maker, are the worst energy-usage offenders

Study author Dr Paula Owen said: 'Our love affair with domestic gadgets and gizmos has to change.

'Just because you have bought an efficient appliance, doesn’t mean you can use it carelessly and never switch it off.'

Households now own three-and-a-half times as many electricity-powered gadgets as they did 20 years ago.

Among the worst offenders in eating up energy are large plasma-screen TVs, tumble dryers and fridge-freezers, particularly those with an ice-maker.

The rise is also the result of a marked decrease in the number of appliances that run off disposable batteries.

The government had set a target of reducing 1990 carbon emissions by 34 per cent by 2020.

Almost a third of the Britain's carbon dioxide emissions come from the home.

In 2009, the average British household contained three-and-a-half times as many gadgets and appliances as it did in 1990.

If every household in Britain replaced their old fridge freezer, washing machine and dishwasher with the most efficient, they could collectively save £585million on fuel bills, the report claims.

Changes: Electricity use and projected demand between 1990 and 2020

Such a widespread switch would also 
prevent two million tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the 
atmosphere, the equivalent of filling Wembley Stadium with gas 257 
times.

Dr Owen said: 'Our domestic choices and behaviour in our homes can make a bigger impact than people think.

'We
need to ask ourselves is that ice-maker in the fridge a necessity? Do I
need to leave those chargers on the whole time? Do I need a 50+ inch TV
screen?

'There’s more 
to this issue than using energy efficient light bulbs. Not only can 
people cut their carbon footprint, but they can also bring down their 
electricity bills considerably.'

Designer Wayne Hemingway, who has worked on award-winning eco-friendly housing projects, insists it is not too late to act.

He said: 'This report is clearly a kick 
up the backside to all of us who imagine that we are taking big steps to
a more sustainable future.

'Clearly we are not going to reverse, nor do we want to reverse the tremendous technological strides that mankind is making.

'But we must harness all this creativity to ensure that we are not storing up an environmental time bomb that will lead future generations to regret our technological advances.'

The report - called Elephant In The Living Room - found there has been good progress since 2006 in improving standards and legislation such as banning patio heaters and incandescent light bulbs.

But the findings also picked up worrying trends in consumer energy usage.

Experts point to the popularity of home computers and all the extra gadgets that go with them - in 1985 only 13 per cent of the population owned a computer, but by 2009 ownership levels had topped 75 per cent.

Leaving your printer turned on permanently, even though you only use it for a few minutes a day, vastly increase your electricity bill.

Although many household appliances such as fridges are now more energy efficient than in 1990 this is being undermined by our preference for larger US-style products.

Similarly, our move towards larger washing machines has the potential to reduce energy use if this means fewer washes - but often no change in washing behaviour makes them a bigger burden on household bills.

The Energy Saving Trust is an independent body set up to help householders reduce their energy bills and combat climate change.
