Raheem Sterling is tired because of the pressure of trying to fill Luis Suarez's boots at Liverpool... not playing for England 

If Mesut Ozil leaves Arsenal for Bayern Munich he will be considered an expensive Premier League flop 

True measure of a top coach like Jose Mourinho or Louis van Gaal is to find a lower-league gem and make him into a world beater like Ian Rush or Stuart Pearce 

The two recent qualifiers for England didn’t exactly get the pulses racing did they? Two routine wins in the end.

But one thing that did excite me a lot from both games was the link up play between Jack Wilshere and Wayne Rooney.

There’s an understanding which is on the brink of being telepathic and it’s something special that England have rarely had.

When Fabio Capello was in charge of England, Rooney linked up with Steven Gerrard in an equally exciting way. They instinctively knew where the other was. Go back and check out a 3-1 win in Belarus – Rooney and Gerrard made Minsk magic that night.

In fact that whole qualifying campaign for the World Cup 2010 saw England play some of their best football of recent times with Rooney and Gerrard at the heart of everything good.

Sadly, Capello lost his nerve and seemed to lose his mind with team selection, tactics and pretty much everything else about managing a team at a World Cup, once they pitched up in South Africa.

This time it could be different.

Roy Hodgson seems to understand what makes Rooney tick. The England captain can make some great runs, peeling off a defender, finding time and space - even in the box.

Wilshere loves to play a killer pass. I’m not one for checking pass completion statistics – if I make 50 two-yard passes back to my keeper as a centre half per game my pass completion stats will be amazing.

I suspect his stats suffer because he tries to play difficult balls sometimes. But that’s what you want from top players – adventure, trying the spectacular, having that imagination and creativity to go for something amazing.

It was only San Marino last week, and only Estonia on Sunday – I get that. But I saw the signs of a link up between Wilshere and Rooney that might not win England the European Championship in 2016, but it will definitely make us pleasing on the eye.

They have an excellent understanding of each other's game

It was reminiscent of Rooney and Steven Gerrard in Belarus back in 2008

Roy Hodgson must harness this when England head to Euro 2016
