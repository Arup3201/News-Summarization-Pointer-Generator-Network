A campervan driver said he planned to boycott a court hearing where he was due to fight a speeding ticket - because it would be against his religion.

Charles Lawson, 60, was fined £60 by authorities who said he drove at 37mph in a 30mph zone.

He was due before magistrates to defend himself today, Christmas Eve, but said he could not because it was the Sabbath of the Ecclesia Bible Church.

A major church called Ecclesia was founded in 1949 in Texas, but its leader told MailOnline Mr Lawson is not a member and it does not have holy days at all, let alone on Tuesdays.

Unholy row: Charles Lawson insists he cannot attend court to contest a speeding fine because the hearing falls on the Sabbath day of his non-denominational Ecclesia Bible Church, based in Texas

Mr Lawson, from Telford, Shropshire, said he was about 70 miles away when the alleged offence happened in Bontddu, west Wales.

He added: 'I was sent photographs supposedly speeding in Bontddu, in the direction of Barmouth.

'According
 to them I was travelling at 37mph in a 30mph zone but I can’t agree to 
that because my campervan’s speedometer is in kilometres but I’ve been 
told that’s no excuse in the eyes of the law.

'I was on the road at that time, yes, but it says I was going in direction of Barmouth.

'At the first court hearing I said I couldn’t admit to have been speeding in the direction of Barmouth as it was a lie.'

Heavens above! Mr Lawson with his court summons and a calendar with which he keeps track of the Sabbath

Lead pastor of Ecclesia: Church Without Religion Andrew Farley said Mr Lawson was not a member, adding: 'We have no holy days of any kind. We hold our services on Sundays like nearly any other Christian church'

Billed as 'church without religion', a church named Ecclesia was founded in 1949 as is based on the high plains of west Texas, part of America's firmly religious Deep South.

Followers believe in a seven-point 
'statement of faith', including the total perfection of the Bible as the
 'verbally inspired word of God and without mistakes as originally 
written'.

But its lead pastor Dr Andrew Farley, who hosts a nationwide radio show and has written several books about his strand of Christianity, said it could not possibly have been his church.

'Charles Lawson is not a member of Ecclesia: Church Without Religion,' he said. 'The calendar he holds in his hand, in the photo, is not anything that we recognise.

'We have no holy days of any kind, and we hold our services on Sundays like nearly any other Christian church.

'Tuesdays are not special in any way, ever.'

Mr Lawson was due today before Mold Magistrates' Court, north Wales, for a date to be fixed for his trial.
