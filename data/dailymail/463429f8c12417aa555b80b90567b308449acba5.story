Encircled by a growing forest of high-rise tower blocks, a couple's home has become an isolated island of dirt - cut off from water and electricity for almost four years.

Niu Chuangen and Zhang Zhongyun dared to stand in the way of a local property developer in Zaozhuang, in the Shandong Province of China.

Now the resolute couple, both in their 60s, have been left stranded on their tiny spot of land, while all around them the ground is dug up and skyscrapers erected.

They became stuck after refusing, what they considered was derisory compensation, offered by developers to move from their home.

The distraught pair now face regular threats from gangsters and have had to fend over a number 
of attempts to illegally demolish their ramshackle home.

They were cut off from utilities in 2009 when a local developer started the enormous earthworks involved in building dozens of high-rise residential 
buildings in the area.

Niu says he has spoken with the 
developer many times in an effort to negotiate an agreement but they 
refuse to offer him more than half the market price of the land his 
house sits on.

Trapped: Niu, right, said he the developers offered them only a small amount of compensation to move, which they were unwilling to accept
