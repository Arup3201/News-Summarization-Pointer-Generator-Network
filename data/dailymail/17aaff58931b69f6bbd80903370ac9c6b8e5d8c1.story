Play for England at the World Cup? I need to learn how to play union first! 

I hung up on Gladiator Russell Crowe the first time he called 

I lived in an apartment owned by Russell Crowe and went to the beach every day... My time in Australia was a dream 

My father's death made me stronger... He was my hero and I know he'd be proud  

When Sam Burgess makes his debut for Bath on Friday night at The Rec, it will actually be the cross-code sensation’s second game of union. The first didn’t go well.

As a league-mad teenager, he had shown no inclination to try his hand at the 15-man game, but after being talked into it, the experiment was short-lived. ‘I was about 14 and I went to Old Brodleians, near Cleckheaton,’ he said.

‘I trained with them for a bit and had one game, because a couple of my mates from school were playing for them. I played fly-half. It was a cold, rubbish day and I just didn’t enjoy it. I didn’t get the ball very much and I was happy to stick with league.’

Fascination with the oval ball gripped Burgess from an early age. ‘I used to sleep with a rugby ball in my arms,’ he said. ‘I was obsessed.’

Yet, as was the case with union, his first match in league - at age five - did more to put him off than entice him. ‘I’ll never forget it,’ he said. ‘I was given the ball and I got tackled straight into a big puddle. It was freezing, I ran off crying and didn’t play again for a year.’

The first time Burgess played Rugby Union as a 14-year-old he did not enjoy it

As one of four brothers, Burgess would play in the back yard at home in West Yorkshire, with Luke -eldest of the siblings - and younger twins George and Tom. Their father, Mark, had played and eventually coached the boys at Dewsbury Moor, while mum Julie also inspired him by going from playing touch rugby to taking up the sport competitively at weekends.

Sam also had his league idols, one of whom is now an England coach in union. ‘Andy Farrell, Adrian Morley and Jamie Peacock were my heroes,’ he said. 

‘If I had to say one, it was Faz. I wasn’t a Wigan fan, but I just thought he was an amazing player. I’ll never forget the first time I saw him, as a kid. I was in a lift at the JJB Stadium, the doors opened and he walked in. I looked up at him and thought “Wow”!’
