A Texas father is suing several lacrosse coaches over claims that his son was kept out of high school games because of a 'pay for play' scheme.

Attorney Bill Munck claimed in his lawsuit that coaches at a Dallas lacrosse academy threatened to give less time on the playing field unless players' parents paid for more training sessions.

The Dallas lawyer said when he refused to give into demands for extra lessons at the private academies his son, also called Billy Munck, was kept on the bench at school matches.

Claims: Billy Munck claims his son was mostly kept on the bench during his sophomore year at high school

In a 39-page lawsuit, he claimed that coaches at Dallas Lacrosse Academy and Episcopal School of Dallas had broken federal anti-corruption laws.

'Through the use of illegal and 
fraudulent conduct, including threats, intimidation and even extortion, 
defendants have tried to ensure that student athletes who want to play 
lacrosse in North Texas have to pay for play and have to go through the 
defendants' enterprise,' the lawsuit, seen by Fox News, claimed.

It went on to claim that Billy had been a victim of 'this criminal enterprise' while playing for his school.

During his sophomore year, the lacrosse fan was kept mostly on the bench by coach Kevin Barnicle.

Accusations: Kevin Barnicle is one of six lacrosse coaches named in the lawsuit

His family claim it was because they had not taken part in classes offered by the for-profit Dallas Lacrosse Academy, which Mr Barnicle was part of.

The lawsuit added that the family were acting to ensure 'others, including Billyâ€™s younger 
brother  ... do not suffer a similar fate.'

The Muncks claimed that lacrosse academies, and six coaches including Mr Barnicle, threatened to cut playing time on high school teams for students if their parents didn't send them to costly private camps or training sessions.

It was alleged that the high school coaches tried to use their position to boost attendance at the academies where they also worked.

The Dallas Lacrosse Academy is also accused in the lawsuit of asking better players to replace weaker team members and to play in recruiting tournaments under other player's names.

In a statement made to Mail Online, the family said: 'Filing this lawsuit was an absolute last resort and is not something that the Munck family took lightly.

'Mr Munck was the volunteer lead coach of a not-for-profit 
lacrosse program for the North Texas Chapter of US Lacrosse. 

'There
 were more than a 150 kids in this program from all walks of life. The 
defendants "asked" that the Muncks abandon their support for this 
not-for-profit program so that the majority of these kids (those whose 
families could afford to pay) would join the Dallas Lacrosse Academy. 

'When
 the Muncks refused to abandon this North Texas program, their son was 
prevented from playing by the defendants, and ultimately transferred 
schools.'

The family claimed that other children and families were also affected by the alleged 'pay for play' scheme.

The coaches and academies named in the lawsuit have not yet responded to a request for comment.

The coaches told the Dallas Observer that they deny the allegations and that this is the second lawsuit the family has tried to bring against them.
