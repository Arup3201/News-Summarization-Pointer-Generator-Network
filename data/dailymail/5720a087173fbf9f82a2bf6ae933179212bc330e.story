Major League Baseball umpire Wally Bell has died of a suspected heart attack aged just 48.

Bell, who worked the Nl playoff series between the Pittsburg Pirates and the St. Louis Cardinals just a week ago, had been feeling ill over the weekend and was scheduled to see doctors on the same day he died.

The father-of-two had quintuple bypass surgery in February 1998 and his father also survived two heart attacks before dying.

He is reported to have suffered a massive heart attack at his home in Youngstown, Ohio.

In a statement commissioner Bud Selig said: 'All of us at Major League Baseball are in mourning tonight regarding the sudden passing of Wally Bell.

'I always enjoyed seeing Wally, who was a terrific umpire and such an impressive young man. On behalf of our 30 clubs, I extend my deepest condolences to Wally's family, fellow umpires and his many friends throughout the game.'

According to Bell's biography on MLB.com, his proudest moment as a big league umpire was returning to the field after having open heart surgery.

Two of his arteries had been 100% blocked, two more had been 80% blocked and another 70%.

Bell came back for a game in San Diego and plate umpire Mark Hirschbeck took the first ball out of play and kept it as a souvenir for Bell.

Bell worked the 2006 World Series and three All-Star Games, including this year's event at Citi Field, where he was stationed at first base.

A veteran of 21 big league seasons, he also had worked four league championship series and seven division series since joining the major league staff in 1993.

The umpires for Game Three of the NL Championship Series at Dodger Stadium heard about Bell's death an hour before they took the field.

Gerry Davis, crew chief for the series, commented that the game was tough but they had to focus and remind themselves that Wally would have wanted the game to go on.

The Los Angeles Angels went on to beat the St Louis Cardinals 3-0.

After the game Davis added: 'It was a devastating loss for us. Wally was a true umpire's umpire. I think if you'll check with the players and teams they felt the same way because Wally always gave 110 percent on the field.'

Several players from around the majors expressed their condolences on Twitter including Dodgers catcher A.J. Ellis, who wrote: 'Wally kept game fun and loose and I always looked forward to catching with him behind plate. I will miss his personality and professionalism.'

Meanwhile Toronto slugger Jose Bautista remembered Bell for his banter, saying: 'He always had great spirits on the field, i will always remember how he teased me about my beard.'

Finally, Red Sox outfielder Shane Victorino commented: 'My thoughts and prayers go out to the family of Wally Bell. So sad to hear (and) will remember him tomorrow as I take the field.'

Bell is the first active MLB umpire to die since John McSherry passed away of a heart attack on the field in Cincinnati on opening day in 1996.

Joe Torre, MLB executive vice president for baseball operations, also offered his condolences, saying: 'I am deeply saddened and shocked at the loss of umpire Wally Bell.

'Umpiring was his life, and he touched so many people within the game of baseball. Aside from being an accomplished, All-Star-calibre umpire, Wally was a loving dad to his two teenage children.

'I extend my deepest condolences to them, his girlfriend Renee, the rest of his family and his admirers across Major League Baseball.'
