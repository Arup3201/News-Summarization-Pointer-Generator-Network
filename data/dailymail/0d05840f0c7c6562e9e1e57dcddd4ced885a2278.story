This is the moment a hairdresser was caught on film shamelessly stealing money from her boss's purse - after she set up a secret camera when cash started to go missing.

Lucy Horton, 23, who had worked at the salon for seven years, was caught red-handed taking cash and stock worth £410 from mother-of-three Siobhan Meadows, 39.

Ms Meadows claimed she was 'devastated' after watching the shocking video as she had been 'very fond' of Horton having trained her - and even invited her to family occasions.

Caught red-handed: Hairdresser Lucy Horton is captured stealing money from mother-of-three Siobhan Meadows after the salon owner set up a secret camera

The salon owner said: 'I was devastated when I saw the footage. Three times in one day I caught her on camera in my purse. I was very fond of Hannah, I can't lie.'

She told the court that she had been advised by police to install a hidden camera in the staff room of Siobhan Meadows Hairdressing, Hartlepool, after she noticed cash was going missing.

Ms Meadows, who herself started hairdressing from the age of 16 before opening her salon in 2002, said she sacked Hannah for gross misconduct after a disciplinary hearing.

The betrayed salon owner said afterwards: 'It's terrible when someone I've employed for seven years from them leaving school could breach your trust in the work place.

'Hannah was a fully-trained hairdresser, I put her through her training and paid her as an apprentice, giving her a contract after qualifying.

'The money she took from me was from my own personal money from my purse, it wasn't takings.

'Thankfully it's rare to come across employees like this.'

Horton pleaded guilty to the theft in November 2014 at Hartlepool Magistrates Court and offered no explanation for her actions.

She was hit with a curfew and fitted with an electronic tag for eight weeks, prohibiting her from leaving her home from 7pm to 7am, and issued with a two-month community order.

Horton was also ordered to pay £410 compensation to her former boss, £85 court costs and a £60 victim surcharge. 

Horton's solicitor Tony Jackson said: 'My client is full of remorse about this. She lost her job, her good name and her previous good character.

'She has offered, both at the police station and to the Probation Service, to pay back the money. She could offer no reason for why she did it. She is really sorry.'

Chairman of the magistrates bench Martin Slimmings told Horton: 'This is a serious crime that you have committed, it's a breach of trust which is particularly nasty.'
