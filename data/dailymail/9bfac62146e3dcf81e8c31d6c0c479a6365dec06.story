A couple has welcomed a set of healthy quintuplets just in time for Father's Day.

Roxanna Hoffman gave birth to four girls and one boy on Friday the 13th as her husband, Michael Hoffman, stood by her side at Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center in Phoenix, Arizona.

The couple, who were living at Luke Air Force Base, New Jersey where Michael was a staff sergeant, until they relocated to be close to the Phoenix hospital, let their son Conner name his new siblings.

The six-year-old chose Aurora, Brielle, Delilah, Elias and Felicity - so the children's names, including Conner's, now match up with the first six letters of the alphabet.

'It became an early Father's Day present and it'll definitely make Father's Day a little bit more memorable now for the rest of my life,' Michael Hoffman said at a press conference. 

The babies were born between 8.15am and 8.17am and ranged from 3 pounds, one ounce to three pounds, 11 ounces in weight. 

'The boy was such a gentleman - he opened the door and let all the girls come first,' perinatologist Dr. Diana Danilenko told AZ Family.   

The newborns are now receiving care at the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit, where they are using respiratory support but otherwise healthy.

They will stay at the hospital until they are big enough to go home, doctors said without giving a date.

Tiny: Baby Delilah is pictured. The couple already have a 'C' in the family - their six-year-old son Conner

'Little gentleman': Baby Elias allowed his four sisters to come out before he was born, doctors said

New addition: Baby Felicity, pictured, was born just in time to wish her dad a happy Father's Day

At a press conference, the couple said their six-year-old son had been shocked by the number of new arrivals.

'He's like, "Oh no, I've got four sisters now I have to watch after. They're going to drive me crazy",' Mr Hoffman said.'But he's a good little boy and if he wants to or not, he's going to be a great help.'

Mrs Hoffman gave birth to the babies after 31 weeks and one day; the national average gestation for quintuplets is 28 weeks.

She had undergone fertility treatment after the couple struggled to conceive following Conner's birth and suffering a miscarriage.

They visited a fertility specialist in New Jersey between May and September 2013 and were diagnosed with unexplained infertility.

In November, Mrs Hoffman started receiving medications and underwent Intrauterine Insemination - and they were stunned to discover they were expecting five babies, she wrote on her blog.

'My husband was pale white, mouth open, and was in complete shock,' she said.

'When we 
walked out of the ultrasound room and sat in the waiting area to talk 
with the doctor, other patients kept looking at him and asking if he was
 okay. His only response was, "There's five"!

'I
 just kept explaining to the other patient's who were waiting what he 
meant. Needless to say, I think he gave the entire waiting room a 
scare!'

Hi mom! Mrs Hoffman smiles as she meets one of her babies for the first time during the delivery on Friday

Happy: The couple pictured after the press conference. The babies will return home when they are big enough

She added: 'The fertility doctors kept apologizing to us, said they did not know how this happened. They urged us to strongly consider selective reduction with this very high-risk pregnancy.'

But the couple, who met in the military, decided to keep the five babies and chose the Phoenix hospital after hearing about Dr John Elliott, a perinatologist and multiple-birth specialist.

'Without this team here, they wouldn't have made it this far and they definitely wouldn't have been this healthy,' Michael Hoffman said.
