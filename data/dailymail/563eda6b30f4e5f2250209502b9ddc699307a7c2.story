The grandfather of Alexandria Hollinghurst, the British teenager who with Brandon Goode, her American boyfriend, killed a policeman, blames himself for the tragedy.

David Hollinghurst also dismisses suggestions that his granddaughter had drug problems or mental illness.

‘She’s a spoilt brat,’ he said. ‘She hadn’t got her own way, so she did whatever she did.’

'Spoilt brat and it's all my fault': Alexandria Hollinghurst, 17, just wanted her own way says her grandfather who blames himself for moving the family to America

Blames himself: David Hollinghurst,  the grandfather of  Alex Hollinghurst, believes that he is at fault for the tragedy that befell her

Mr Hollinghurst emigrated to America in 1995 with his wife Lynett. Their son, Tom, his wife Jane and their two daughters followed 12 years later. They moved into a bungalow in one of the new neighbourhoods on the edge of Disney World.

He blames himself for the tragedy. ‘I’m the one that came here,’ he said. ‘It sucks, this place, it’s horrible. I’m angry at myself for coming here.’ 

Another ex-pat Brit, a property developer from Oldham in his 50s, told The Times: ‘A lot of Brits live here. Like Disney World, it’s a fine place for children and adults of a certain age, but it can be a hard place to keep a teenager.

Alexandria Hollinghurst had an uneasy relationship with her mother but adored her father (left); Officer Robert German was on duty last Saturday when he encountered Hollinghurst and her boyfriend Brandon Goode. They murdered him before committing suicide

‘There is a void there,’ he said. ‘One of my son’s friends just hanged himself. Florida is a pill mill.’ 

Alexandria Hollinghurst was bright – she completed school a year early – but frustrated in the confines of her home and had a rocky relationship with her mother.

In a letter she wrote to 18-year-old Goode, after the pair was arrested on drugs charges, she revealed that she hoped she would go to prison. ‘I need a break from the bitch.’

She had met Goode in 2012 and saw a new life with him. They would drive to Kissimmee to buy marijuana. On a trip back in February this year the police stopped the car and found drug paraphernalia inside. Goode was sent to jail and Hollinghurst to a juvenile assessment centre.

They wrote to each other several times, hatching more and more unlikely plans including one that involved stealing a boat and sailing to Panama.

Both sets of parents wanted the couple apart. On March 19, the day before he was due in court, Goode delivered a letter to Hollinghurst’s home.

'Brat': Alexandria Hollinghurst moved to America in 2007, following her grandfather, David, who emigrated in 1995. He later regretted the move and blamed himself for the tragedy that befell his granddaughter

She climbed out of her bedroom window, leaving a rude letter for her mother.

‘Thank you for accusing me of being anorexic FOR YEARS,’ she wrote. ‘After trying to fix things, thank you for turning a conversation about depression and suicide into something all about you.’

Ironically, neither Goode nor Hollinghurst were going to see the inside of a prison – he was to be sent to a rehabilitation unit and no further action was to be taken against her.

By that time, it was too late and the two teenagers were on the run.

Officer Robert German was tasked with intercepting the couple as they made their way to Goode’s father’s house in Windermere, an affluent area.

He caught up with them around 4am last Saturday. Three shots rang out – Officer German was murdered. Five minutes later, the two teenagers were also dead.
