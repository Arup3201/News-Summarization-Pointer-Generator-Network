A San Francisco man has claimed he is the son of the late former Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers NBA star Wilt Chamberlain.

During a 12-year long search to find his real parents, Aaron Levi, 50, received confirmation from his birth mother that the Hall of Fame basketball player  is his father.

After he found his biological mother 'Elizabeth', whose real name is not used for privacy reasons, the white British woman told him she conceived him after a one-night stand with Chamberlain, he told Sports Illustrated.

Documents with background information about Levi's biological parents noted that Elizabeth would not identify the father to protect his name, and that she gave Levi up for adoption because she felt she could not raise a bi-racial child.

During a 12-year long search to find his birth parents, Aaron Levi (left), 50, received confirmation from his birth mother that the Hall of Fame basketball player, Wilt Chamberlain, is his father. But Chamberlain, who died in 1999, claimed that he would never have a child

The 7'1' star, who once scored 100 points in one game, boasted about having slept with 20,000 women in his memoir, A View From Above. He worked out he slept with, on average, 2.3 women a day since he was 15 years old

Even though the 7'1' star claimed he slept with 20,000 women in his memoir, A View From Above, he maintained until he died in 1999 that he did not have any children.

Chamberlain, who once scored 100 points in one game, worked out he slept with on average 2.3 women a day since he was 15 years old.

Levi, who stands at 6'5' tall, said that had he known the San Francisco Warrior  player was his father 20 years ago, when Chamberlain was still alive, his life would have been completely different.

Born in 1965, Levi was raised in Oregon by adoptive parents Don and Harriet, and only knew very few details about his birth parents growing up.

'Elizabeth', whose real name is not used for privacy reasons, said she met Chamberlain at a jazz club in San Francisco and then went out with him a few nights later. She said she had too much to drink and ended up at his apartment, and that night Levi was conceived

He began the search for them in 2003 and got closer to answers after collecting background information  in 2004.

The information, which is believed to be provided entirely by Elizabeth, said that Levi's mother was a white woman of English-French descent; while details of his father included that he was was a black professional basketball player who was 6'10', born in Kansas and held a Masters degree.

However, the details did not exactly match with those of Chamberlain: the NBA star was from Philadelphia and attended the University of Kansas for only three years without obtaining a degree.

As he continued to search for more answers, in 2009, Levi received a birth certificate with Elizabeth's name and was eventually connected with her.

He said: 'It's been a burden on me to feel that I am her secret, and I am Wilt's secret, and I am the Chamberlain family's secret. 

'That's been hard for me...I already know what's going to happen if I don't do anything. I'm going to have an unfinished journey.'

After a more than hour-long conversation, she revealed the details of her 'casual relationship' with Chamberlain.

Elizabeth said they met at a jazz club in San Francisco and then went out a few nights later, when she said she had too much to drink and ended up at his apartment.

When Chamberlain learned of the news that Elizabeth was pregnant, he chuckled and said: 'Oh, so I'm gonna have a kid out there, huh?'

That night, she conceived Levi and five months later told him she was pregnant and had plans to give the child up for adoption.

When Chamberlain learned of the news, he  chuckled and said: 'Oh, so I'm gonna have a kid out there, huh?'

Levi has tried to reach out to some of Chamberlain's relatives who remain closed to meeting him and refuse to participate in DNA tests because they feel doubts surround his claim.

In his continued mission of self-discovery, he hopes to inspire other people who have been adopted to begin their searches earlier than he did.

Levi and Elizabeth met in person in 2010, where they had different feelings about Chamberlin, and spent time together again in England last Fall.

He said: 'I wanted her to tell me something good about him, but that wasn't going to happen. I realized that we had different feelings about him. 

'She sees him as a womanizer...to me, he's my father.'
