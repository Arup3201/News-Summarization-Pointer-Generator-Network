Recovery workers have found human remains on Tuesday inside a cement silo in Medley, Florida, where a plant worker disappeared more than two weeks ago following a roof collapse during Tropical Storm Isaac.

The identity of the victim has not been confirmed, although the only missing employee was 58-year-old Pierre Mezidor, who was standing on the roof when it gave way underneath him.

The father of two plummeted into the towering silo storing tightly-packed cement powder, which quickly filled with rainwater from the approaching storm.

For more than two weeks, the recovery
effort has been led by Miami-Dade police, the federal Mine Safety and 
Health Administration, and workers hired by Titan America, the company 
that owns the Pennsuco Plant, according to the Miami Herald.

Pierre Mezidor, a 58-year-old immigrant father of two, was standing atop the silo, measuring the quantity of dry cement inside, when the accident occurred

Attorney Edward Blumberg, who 
represents Mezidor’s family, hired three structural engineers to 
investigate the scene in order to determine the cause of the collapse.

‘Something went seriously wrong, but 
it would be a mistake to say for sure until we have everything squared 
away,’ Blumberg said. ‘We don’t want to jump to a conclusion until all 
the dots connect.’

Wind and rain from Isaac slowed an already difficult task to find Mezidor’s body. The storm dumped rain into the silo that was about 70 per cent full of cement.

Police said the remains found inside the silo were taken to the medical examiner's office for an autopsy and identification, Local 10 News reported.

Mezidor's co-workers who witnessed the collapse on August 17 described it as a 'a horribly gruesome event.'

'His son is like collapsing inside,' family friend Yolaine Casimier told Local 10 News outside Mr. Mezidor's Florida homestead.

Mezidor was reportedly standing atop the 200-foot silo located in Medley, Florida, at around 8.30am, measuring the level of dry cement inside, when the roof beneath him  buckled and collapsed.

Along with the piecemeal roof, Mezidor reportedly fell some 140 feet into a silo that one fire official said was only 20 per cent full of dry cement at the time.

Rainwater from Isaac quickly poured into the suddenly-open silo, not quite creating wet concrete, but rather a gooey mush that has bound to debris - and hampered recovery efforts.

'I just look at the situation myself, my head ready to blow and seeing that big thing,' Casimier told Local 10 News.

'From what we see the situation he's not going to come out alive.'

Freakish Accident: The incident occurred at Titan America's Tarmac Cement Plant in Medley, Fla., which manufacturers dry cement

Mezidor had been working at the Tarmac Cement plant, which is owned by Titan America, for 19 years, according to Local 10 News. His step-daughter has said that he loved his job so much that he would go into work on his days off.

Titan America told The Miami Herald that company officials 'deeply regret the incident and emphasize that employee safety is their primary concern.'

'I just look at the situation myself, my head ready to blow and seeing that big thing. From what we see the situation he's not going to come out alive.'

But family members have already hired an attorney in anticipation of filing a civil suit.

'This type of death in and of itself is unspeakable,' Blumberg told The Herald, 'and the family still does not have the closure of having a body.'

Miami-Dade Fire Rescue reportedly lowered sophisticated cameras and listening devices into the silo - devices sensitive enough to hear someone tapping -  but heard no signs of life.

'We have cadaver dogs that detect only dead people and we have live rescue dogs,' MDFR Lt. Arnold Piedrahita told Local 10 News in the day. 'Hopefully, with those dogs we will be able to determine whether this is going to be a recovery operation or continue as a rescue operation.'
