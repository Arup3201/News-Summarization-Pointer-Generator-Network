Officials seeking to prosecute a nine-year-old boy who is accused of accidentally shooting a classmate have said they do not want the child to go to jail.

'Nobody is trying to lock this little boy up,' said Washington state prosecutor Russ Hauge.

He said prosecutors hope to hold the boy accountable not through incarceration, but rather probation, treatment and other services.

Consequences: A boy appeared in court, supported by his uncle and father, facing charges of shooting a classmate with a handgun he had brought in his backpack to their Washington school

The third-grader faces charges of unlawful possession of a gun, bringing a dangerous weapon to school and third-degree assault.

He is facing a capacity hearing in 
which a judge will determine if he knew what he did was wrong. If the 
judge decides the boy knew, the charges go forward.

An eight-year-old classmate - Amina 
Kocer-Bowman - was wounded. She is in a Seattle hospital in critical 
condition after undergoing surgeries.

Few additional details of the case 
have been released, though the investigation may include a look at how 
the boy got the .45-calibre pistol that went off in his backpack.

Mr Hauge said his office is working with the investigative agencies involved in the shooting.

Victim: Amina Kocer-Bowman was accidentally shot in the abdomen when the gun that was inside another student's backpack went off and hit her

Police believe the boy got the gun during a weekend visit with his mother, Jamie Lee Chaffin.

According to court documents, Ms 
Chaffin has been convicted of forgery and drug crimes. As a felon, her 
right to own a firearm was revoked.

She completed court-ordered drug treatment, and no additional criminal charges were filed against her after 2007.

The boy's father, Jason Cochran, has 
been convicted of violating protection orders relating to Ms Chaffin and
has been taken to court for child support.

Both parents relinquished custody of the boy and his two sisters to his paternal grandmother.

She died shortly after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2010, and the boy's uncle Patrick Cochran was granted custody.

Horror: Kiomi Pavlock, 12, hugs her dad James as a friend shows her anguish over the incident. The school went into lockdown on Wednesday

Distraught: Savannah Anderson, 13, hugs her little sister Kaylee, 10, after arriving in the school's gymnasium to take her home after the shooting

The boy's family bailed him out of 
juvenile detention and took him to his uncle's home on Thursday night. 
Bail had been set at $50,000.

The boy will remain under house arrest and must check in daily with the county juvenile department.

Shaking in his orange jumpsuit, the boy wept as he faced his first court hearing after the incident.

As court officers led the boy away after the hearing, his father hugged him and gave him a kiss while they both cried.

The boy's father, Mr Cochran, said 
outside the courthouse: 'I just want everyone to know that my kid made a
mistake. It was a terrible mistake.'

'He's a good kid. It's all I can say,' said his uncle. 'I apologise to the family of that girl. I really do.'

He added: 'I just want him back home.'

Probe: The third-grade boy who allegedly brought the gun into school is being held at a juvenile detention centre on suspicion of illegally possessing a firearm and third-degree assault

Emergency: A police officer stands watch by the entrance to Armin Jahr Elementary School in Washington, where eight-year-old Amina Kocer-Bowman was shot when a gun discharged inside a boy's backpack

Court documents stated that the boy 
told a classmate five days ago that he was going to bring his 'dad's 
gun' to school and run away.

The gun discharged after the boy slammed his backpack down on a desk, it was reported.

Dr Eileen Bulger said the girl will likely be in hospital for several weeks and face further surgeries.

She was sedated and on a ventilator but has woken up and interacted with her parents.

Her father, John Bowman, thanked his 
daughter's teacher. He said: 'Had she not administered first aid and 
stopped the bleeding from the gunshot wound, this event would have 
surely been tragic.'

Lori Morsette, a friend of the 
victim's family, said: 'She is a sweet little girl and I don't know what
to do. I'm trying to be supportive for my friends, I'm trying to be 
there for them.'

The school is in a quiet residential neighborhood about 20 miles west of Seattle, across Puget Sound.
