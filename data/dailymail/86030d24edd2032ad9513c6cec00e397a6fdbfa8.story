Against all odds: Grant Virgin was hospitalized for months after the hit and run that almost took his life

A California teenager left dead after a horrifying hit and run made a miraculous recovery – and his family says fish oil saved his
life.

Grant Virgin’s long road to recovery began in September 2012
after he was run over by a car. He was clinically dead until paramedics revived
him – but he suffered severe brain damage.

The now-17-year-old also suffered a torn aorta, skull
fractures and bleeding on the brain, and bone and spine fractures, the Virgin
family told CNN. Doctors said he would likely not survive through the night.

‘It's like, how dare you not fight for my son's life?’
Mother JJ Virgin recalled. ‘It really took us ... getting very aggressive and
assertive to save our son's life, because they weren't going to do it.

‘They told us not to. They told us to let him go,’ she
continued.

But the family, from Palm Desert, refused to accept that
Grant would not live to see another day.

Police soon closed their investigation into the case having never found the person who hit the teen, according to the Desert Times, but his family fought on to save his life.

A long road back: The Virgin family began administering high doses of fish oil to Grant soon after he woke up

JJ Virgin, a renowned fitness expert, decided to try any and
everything she thought would help her son.

The teen underwent several surgeries to stabilize his
condition, but his brain function did not dramatically improve – until a friend
suggested they try fish oil and progesterone.

Progesterone has been shown in studies to reduce swelling on
the brain – though not when rubbed topically as the Virgin’s did.

The suggestions came after a mine disaster survivor was left
brain dead but came back to almost complete normalcy after large doses of fish
oil.

Remarkable results: Within two days, Grant (pictured with father John) was making phone calls home

Even more amazing: Grant was soon on his way home and walking again

Grant Virgin soon woke up and began speaking – but only with
a limited vocabulary, his family recalled.

‘Let’s go,’ he would say, ‘I love you,’ he often repeated.

Improvement was slow at first, but it was noticeable.

‘When your kid is in a coma, and then coming out of a coma,
you watch every nuance,’ JJ Virgin told CNN. ‘If his eyelash fluttered, 'Oh,
his eyelash fluttered!

‘You're holding on to anything that you can see and
monitoring everything, every single day. And so it was very clear when the
acceleration happened. Really clear.’

The Virgin family started administering high doses of the
natural remedy to Grant to see if it would speed his recovery since the brain’s
cell wall is made of omega-3 fatty acids.

‘If you have a brick wall and it gets damaged, wouldn't you
want to use bricks to repair it?’ Dr. Michael Lewistold CNN. ‘By supplementing
using (omega-3 fatty acids) in substantial doses, you provide the foundation
for the brain to repair itself.’

Fish oil did not work, though, in every instance it was
tried, CNN notes, but the Virgin’s went ahead with the unorthodox therapy at a
dosage of 20-grams-per-day. The largest known dosage ever given to anyone.

‘If someone said to me, you know what, you can give him fish
oil, you can give him better nutrition, you'll get maybe 5% (improvement), I'll
take that,’ the mother said.

JJ Virgin got a late night phone call only two days after
Grant started taking the fish oil.

'A miracle': Workers at the hospital Grant healed in called him a miracle during his recent visit

‘I get this call like midnight, and I'm asleep, and I wake
up the next morning and go, 'Did Grant call me and did we have this whole
conversation?’ she recalled.

‘I just remember waking up the next morning going, 'I must
have dreamed that, that couldn't have possibly happened.’

She drove to the hospital that morning in shock, two months
after doctors told her to ‘let him go,’ Grant Virgin was talking.

‘We had been told he'd never be able to recognize anybody,
he will never be able to focus his eyes, all the grim stuff,’ father John
Virgin told CNN.

‘[They said] the diffuse damage to his brain is so much that
he's never going to be Grant again,’ he continued.

The teen hasn’t made a full recovery, he may never, but he
has recovered to a point far greater than anyone thought possible.

Physically healed: The 17-year-old is fully healed physically, he has resumed weight lifting and other activities

Realization: Despite all the progress he's made, Grant Virgin knows he still has a lot of work to come fully back

A recent visit to the hospital he spent more than two months
in showed him greeted by a nurse calling him a ‘miracle.’

He returned with presents for 20 children and gave them out
while smiling, laughing and joking with the younger patients.

‘From when he first arrived compared to now is just night
and day,’ occupational therapist Elly Schoap, who works at the hospital, told
the Desert Times. ‘When he left us he was able to walk and talk, but he was
still very impaired.

‘This is why we work in this area,’ she continued. ‘To have
him come back and see this kind of success story is just amazing.’
