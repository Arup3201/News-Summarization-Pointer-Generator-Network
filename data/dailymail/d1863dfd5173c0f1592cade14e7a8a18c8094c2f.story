A decision to ban a same-sex couple from a school ball has been overturned after a 250-signature petition called for its reconsideration.

James Fallon High School Year 11 student Sami Burgess wanted to take her girlfriend, Karlina Macartney, to a presentation ball at the school on September 19.

But when the 17-year-old asked her principal at the Albury school - in rural New South Wales - for permission, Sami told The Sydney Morning Herald she was rebuffed and told it was 'socially unacceptable' for her to bring her 21-year-old partner.

After telling her friends about what happened, it sparked a petition that garnered more than 250 signatures.

When the decision was overturned, Ms Macartney took to Facebook to rejoice.

'Thanks...everyone for the support, Sami Burgess deserves happiness and so does the future same sex couples,' she wrote.

A NSW Department of Education spokesman said the school's principal had denied using the words 'socially unacceptable' in her conversation with Sami.

'The initial decision was not made because of the partnerâ€™s gender,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was based on the long-standing practice of encouraging students to select partners from within Year 11 or when that was not possible to avoid choosing someone with a significant age difference or a current boyfriend/girlfriend.

'The principal finalised the decision after reconsidering the strength of the student's commitment to the issue and discussion with the student's parents.'

The spokesman also added: 'James Fallon High School strongly fosters the value of respect for all and does not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, sexual preference, politics, age or disabilities.'

Sami said the overturning of the decision was for all gay people, not just her.

She revealed another of her classmates asked to take their same-sex partner to the ball but did ask because they thought they would be refused.

'I want this to be for everyone in every school,' Sami told The Sydney Morning Herald.

'Everyone should have the right in society to be able to go as a same-sex couple.'

Despite this setback, Sami said the school's staff had been supportive of her in the past.
