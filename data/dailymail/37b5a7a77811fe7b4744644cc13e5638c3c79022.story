Babysitter Jay Miller, pictured, has been jailed for 30 months for beating a toddler in his care

A babysitter who battered a toddler so badly his thumb and fingerprints were left on the child's face, has been jailed for 30 months.

Jay Miller, 21, broke the two-year-old's arm, held her by her ears and hit her head while the youngster's mother was out of the house, Cardiff Crown Court heard.

A judge told Miller that the 'emotional impact' on the little girl he attacked could not be measured.

The bruises and arm fracture - caused by pulling and twisting, according to doctors - were sustained while the little girl's mother was attending a hospital appointment and on another was out at a JobCentre meeting.

The mother said Miller told her, 'they'll blame me - I'm going to prison' when she called an ambulance.

Her mother claimed she had heard him muttering 'I'm sorry, I'm so sorry' while her granddaughter was being put in plaster.

Miller, from Barry, South Wales, had denied one charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm and four of actual bodily harm.

He claimed the spiral fracture happened by her falling off a bed.

And he said the bruising had happened a couple of days before when she slipped down a grass bank and into a wall after he allowed her out of her pram while taking her for a walk.

Miller told Cardiff Crown Court: 'I have got a bit of a temper but it is not as bad as everybody is making out.'

Prosecutor Ieuan Bennett accused him of losing his patience when the child either didn't use her potty or would not eat food he had prepared for her.

Expert witnesses Dr Stephen Chapman, from Birmingham Children's Hospital, and Dr Paul Davies, who works at the University Hospital of Wales, said a spiral fracture would be 'unique' and a case for the record books if it was caused simply by falling from a bed.

Defence lawyer Kevin Seal told the court: 'He still protests his innocence and he faces jail with trepidation.'

Recorder Jonathan Furness told Miller: 'There are profound implications for the child and mother and the emotional impact of the case cannot be measured.'
