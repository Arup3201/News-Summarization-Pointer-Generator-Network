A rogue wallaby spotted bounding around north London has finally been captured after one final escapade in a children's playground.

The animal, known as Jean, was seen hopping through the famous graves in Highgate Cemetery two weeks ago and snacking in Hampstead's Fitzroy Park the week before.

But finally, after a major search by Londoners and RSPCA officials, the wild animal has been rescued as she tried to venture further afield.

But it does not signal the end of the month-long hunt as witness reports claim another wallaby is still on the loose.

Capture: Jean the wallaby was cornered in York Rise estate, Hampstead, London, yesterday morning

Chaos: 18-year-old Oscar Chettleborough called the RSPCA when he saw the animal after a night out

RSPCA inspectors received calls from an 18-year-old on his way home from a night out at 5am yesterday who spotted the creature in the children's playground of York Rise estate near Dartmouth Park.

A confused Oscar Chettleborough exclaimed down the phone: 'A large wild animal is causing chaos,' as Jean bounced around the 1930s red brick courtyard.

Inspector Leigh Summers was alerted at 7am, and armed himself with a tennis net to wrap around the wallaby, a notoriously fierce and strong creature.

Although Inspector Summers was apprehensive about tackling the wallaby, it seems Jean had had enough of adventuring.

By
the time the inspector arrived, local children were feeding apples to the gentle creature, who readily tumbled into the inspector's tennis net and remained 
calm throughout the journey to her new pound near Heathrow airport.

Inspector Summers said: 'I had 
been told to handle the wallaby by grasping its tail and hold it as high
as I could off the ground and as far away from me as possible to stop 
it finding any purchase for its legs.

'In
fact, when I did grasp it the animal just hung there, relaxed, very 
much like a cat does when it is scruffed by its mother so I knew it was 
used to being handled like this.

'The biggest problem I had was untangling the netting around it when I got it back to the van.'

He told the Camen New Journal: 'I've worked for the RSPCA for nine years and this is my first wallaby.'

He added that he is still unsure as to how Jean managed to get out of the high-walled 
Highgate Cemetery and through the busy streets to York Rise.

It is the finale in a large-scale bid by Londoners and RSPCA officers to track down the animal for fear of it being injured on the busy roads.

Unexpected: A wallaby was filmed hopping around Highgate Cemetery in north London two weeks ago

Adventure: The marsupial hopped around some of the 53,000 graves at the burial site to onlookers' amazement

Wallabies are marsupials, like kangaroos but smaller.

Unlike kangaroos who mainly eat grass, they feed on leaves and as a result they have very different teeth.

They originate from Australia but zoo owners brought them to the UK in the late 1800s.

The most prolific free colony of wallabies in the UK was in Staffordshire when a family famously broke free from a private zoo in Leek.

They made a home in the Midlands' countryside and survived happily in the wild.

Their population peaked in the 1970s.

Although they were reported to have died out in the early 2000s, a photographer spotted the tribe in 2009.

The colony has cousins living in Norfolk's Fenland and Ashdown Forest, Sussex.

There is also a population in Inchconnachan, an island of Scotland's Loch Lomond, created by Lady Arran Colquhoun in the 1920s.

A spokeswoman for the charity said the 
animal is believed to be one of a pair dumped in Highgate Woods, and a 
second wallaby is still thought to be on the loose in north London.

Maurice Melzak, a documentary maker and zoologist living in the area, spotted the creature during a walk through Highgate Cemetery two weeks ago.

He grabbed his camera to capture the unusual moment as the wallaby bounded over the 53,000 graves.

He and other concerned Londoners contacted numerous local zoos when the animals were first spotted - but none of them were missing a wallaby.

The nearby Golders Hill Park Zoo homes wallabies but a spokesperson said that none of their animals had escaped in recent years.

London Zoo in Regentâ€™s Park also confirmed that none of their animals had escaped.

However, the search for the second wallaby is under way, with inspectors hoping to find new homes for them in the near future.

An RSPCA spokesperson said: 'We've had reports of more than one wallaby being seen. They are herd animals and don't live on their own, they live in a family.

'It would've been strange for one wallaby to be living so healthily and happily without another one, so we're pretty sure there's another one to be found.

'We're not sure where they came from 
but we think they could have been dumped by their owner or escaped from 
some sort of establishment.

'It
is the first time Inspector Summers has rescued a wallaby before, which
is why he spoke to London Zoo and got advice from their kangaroo and 
wallaby experts.

Not alone: The sighting follows news that another wallaby was seen on Hampstead Heath three weeks ago

'The wallaby is now doing well at its temporary home near Heathrow.'

The charity said populations of red-necked wallabies became established in the wild in Britain back in the 1940s.

However, the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prohibits the release of them as they are a non-native species, so the Highgate wallaby will end up in a zoo or somewhere that has a population of the animals.
