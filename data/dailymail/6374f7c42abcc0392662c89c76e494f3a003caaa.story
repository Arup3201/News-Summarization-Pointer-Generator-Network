The triumph of an anti-austerity party in the Greek elections appears to have upset a higher power.

An icon of Jesus Christ being crucified at a church in Asprokambos, Corinth, is said by priests to have been ‘crying’ since January 25 - the day that the left-wing Syriza government won the vote.

Crowds have been flocking to see the weeping icon at the church of St Nickolas in the Greek village, which is believed to have a clear, oily, sticky and odourless liquid running down it.

'Tears': An icon of Christ being crucified at a church said by priests to have been 'crying' since January 25

Liquid: Crowds have been flocking to see the icon at the church of St Nickolas in Asprokambos, Greece

People amazed by the phenomenon have been visiting the church to pray at the shrine - and priests have vowed to get a team of scientists to examine the tears, reported La Repubblica.

Dionysios Mantalos, the Metropolitan Bishop of Corinth, said he would inform the Greek Holy Synod of the findings, but cautioned that conclusions should not be made until tests have been carried out.

The crying of the icon, which is around a century old, has been billed by some as the 'Miracle of Syriza' - but Bishop Mantalos called for prayer, adding: ‘In matters of faith we must be very careful.’

Last month Greece’s new Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras - who is an atheist - broke with tradition by not being sworn in by the head of Greece’s orthodox church, currently Archbishop Ieronymos II.

TV comedy: The incident has drawn comparisons to a 1986 episode of BBC sitcom Only Fools and Horses, which sees Del Boy (David Jason, right) witness an apparent miracle of a crying Virgin Mary statue

The incident has drawn comparisons to a 1986 episode of BBC sitcom Only Fools and Horses, which sees Del Boy (David Jason) witness an apparent miracle of a crying Virgin Mary statue.

But, in the 'The Miracle of Peckham' episode, following a media frenzy the priest realises that the miracles always occur when it is raining - and discovers that all of the lead tiles are missing on the church's roof, causing a leak.

Greek investigative journalist Yiannis Baboulias told Newsweek of the latest incident: ‘The weeping icon is an urban legend that resurfaces every now and again in Greece. Stories like this happen all the time, and this one is really funny.’

He said he believes the 'paint on the icon is starting to leak due to environmental changes'.
