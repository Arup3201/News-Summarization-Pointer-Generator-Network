Tom Daley admitted he considered quitting diving after winning bronze at London 2012.

Daley said the post-Olympic hangover was so persistent he struggled to commit fully to training and even considered other career options.

‘If you ask any Olympic athlete, the year after the Olympics is always the toughest year,’ said Daley.

‘You spend four years training as hard as you possibly can and you then realise everything you have built up to is over.

'You are on that high and when you come back to training you have got another four years to do the same thing, so it is tough to get back into it and especially hard for me because last year was full of injury.’

Daley, 20, denied he was planning to quit after the Commonwealth Games and insisted he is fully committed to competing at the Rio Olympics in 2016.

‘Pigs might fly, Rio is still my main aim,’ he said.

‘You can’t always stay on that high all the way through your diving career. You have to go down to come back up.’

Next week Daley, 20, attempts to defend the 10metre individual and 10m synchronised Commonwealth titles he won in Delhi in 2010. Daley, who relocated his training base from Plymouth to the Aquatics Centre in Stratford, added: ‘It’s given me a fresh look on diving and everything is changing.

‘I miss Plymouth a lot because it is my home town but London has given me a fresh take on everything and got me to step up a little bit.’
