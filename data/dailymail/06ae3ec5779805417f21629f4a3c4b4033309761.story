Argentina star Carlos Tevez has revealed his excitement at returning to Upton Park on Wednesday night to take on Croatia.

Tevez joined West Ham for the 2006-2007 season along with compatriot Javier Mascherano, before moving to Manchester United.

And the 30-year-old, a crowd favourite with Hammers fans after saving them from relegation, will return to the Boleyn Ground as Argentina play the first of a double-header of friendly matches in England, with a match against Portugal lined up at Old Trafford on Tuesday.

Carlos Tevez's record at West Ham in the 2006-07 season:

Matches: 26 Starts: 19

Goals: 7 Assists: 3 Chances created: 29

Shots: 48 On target: 28 

(all goals came in final 10 matches) 

West Ham finished 17th 

In an exclusive interview with whufc.com, Tevez said: 'I'm looking forward to it. I know I'm going to be playing a home game. I know the pitch very well and I know the fans very well. I've got great memories of West Ham, they were my first European club, so I'm very relaxed and looking forward to it.

'I would like to thank everyone, because the welcome here is always brilliant. I care very much about all the West Ham people and I always miss them.

'I'm very, very thankful for everything, I'm No 1 West Ham fan for ever, because of the way they welcomed me, the love they showed me and everything, it was my first time in Europe and they made me who I am today. 

'I will always be very thankful to West Ham fans and I'll be West Ham's No 1 fan.'

Tevez, who now plays for Juventus, scored the only goal in a 1-0 win against Manchester United on the final match of the 2006-07 season to help keep the Hammers up.

And the Argentine clearly still takes much satisfaction from the part he played that season.

Tevez said: 'The fact that we had a very tough year, meant that it was very special fighting against relegation. I think the club, as well as the fans, did everything they could to get the best out of me in order to save them.'
