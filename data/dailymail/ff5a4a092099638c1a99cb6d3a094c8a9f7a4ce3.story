Legendary Fifties siren Shirely MacLaine has listed her sprawling, 7,450-acre New Mexico ranch for sale at $18m.

Her reasoning for the price? Because one plus eight equals nine. And the number nine is significant according to her 'numerology' beliefs, which are based on the 'vibration and meaning' of figures.

'Nine is the number of completion,' says the 79-year-old Oscar-winning actress, who is famed for her kooky new-age spiritual beliefs. 'To me, it's not about money, it's about completion.'

Unorthodox pricing: Actress Shirely MacLaine has listed her 7,450-acre ranch near Santa Fe, New Mexico, for $18m, based on the principle that one plus eight equals nine, and nine is the 'number of completion'

According to the Wall Street Journal, Ms MacLaine originally consulted a number of psychics, who advised her to list the property for a cool $30 million, but the headstrong screen legend ultimately settled on her own logic.

'If it works for Shirley, it works for us,' says her realtor, Susan Kline of Sotheby’s International Realty’s Santa Fe office.

The beautiful landscape holds a roughly 9,000 square-foot main house and comes with a caretaker's cottage, a horse barn, a yurt, a swimming pool and two ponds.

Ms McLaine
 says the moment she set foot on the property, some 20 years ago, she 
was struck by its energy. Indeed, on a 2011 Oprah show appearance, she spoke freely of the 'numerous' UFO encounters she and a neighbor had witnessed for 'extended periods of time.'

Fully equipped: The property boasts a 9,000-square-foot home with a horse barn, swimming pool, two ponds and a stone labyrinth atop a hill which Ms MacLaine says helps her listen to her 'inner guidance'

As you'd expect from a woman who takes an active interest in transcendental meditation, metaphysics, reincarnation and extra-terrestrial activity; the elaborate home comes with some rather otherworldly features.

The Plaza Blanca Ranch, as it's known, 'insists on peace,' says Ms MacLaine, and boasts a stone labyrinth, built atop a hill, which she claims helps her listen to her 'inner guidance.'

'When I 
was writing or when I had decisions to make or had something bothering 
me, or when I wanted to thank the universe for something, I would go up 
and walk the labyrinth,' she affirms.

After purchasing the property, Ms MacLaine split the main house into two, and says that whenever she hosted 'reincarnation seminars', participants were regulated to only one side.

She also built an apartment underneath the house, modeled after the Native American concept of Kiva, which functions as an underground room for spiritual ceremonies.

Film buffs will be interested to know that her dining room holds the large table which appeared in the film Terms of Endearment, for which she won an Oscar for Best Actress in 1984.

'It was such a difficult shoot - I said, "I'm taking it!"' she allegedly told the production crew.

As for Ms MacLaine's unorthodox pricing methods, MailOnline spoke to Brendon DeSimone, a national real estate expert, CEO of DeSimone & Co, and author of upcoming book Next Generation Real Estate.

Ms DeSimone explains that while he can't comment on 'how far off' the listing price might be, his is an industry where anything goes.

'People can price at whatever they want,' he says, adding that celebrity-owned properties with stories behind them have a tendency to 'push people over the edge' in terms of closing a sale.

It's a statement echoed by New York-state based broker Harris Safier, who once sold a house that reputedly belonged to Isabella Rosellini. Despite his market value estimation, the buyer chose to pay five per cent over Mr Safier's highest suggested price range.

'They did it for the cache they perceived,' he tells us.

At the end of the day, despite Ms MacLaine's deep spiritual ties to the place she has called home for 20 years, she says she is moving closer to New Mexico's capital, Santa Fe, for somewhat materialistic reasons.

'I want to go to the movies, good restaurants,' she says. 'I really need to be closer, or I would tend to become a complete recluse out there.'
