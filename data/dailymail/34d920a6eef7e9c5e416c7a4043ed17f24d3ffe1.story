A jealous husband who shot his wife five times with an illegal firearm after learning of her secret affair with a younger man was today jailed for 12 years.

David Leeman, 60, shot Jennie, 44, with a semi-automatic pistol at close range in a barn on the farm they once shared in rural Devon.

Their marriage was already on the rocks when Mrs Leeman, who had two sons and two daughters with the defendant during a 20-year relationship, started seeing another man, Norman Laramy, 40.

Guilty: David Leeman, left, has been jailed for shooting his wife Jennie with a a semi-automatic pistol

Leeman discovered the couple’s affair six days before he killed Mrs Leeman, Exeter Crown Court heard.

He said he heard voices in his head in the moments leading up to the death.

Leeman admitted manslaughter on the grounds of a 'loss of control' because he was taking anti-depressants at the time, which he said had an impact on his thought process.

Senior medical professionals were divided on whether the dosage Leeman was taking was sufficient to cause his behaviour on the day he shot his wife.

It took the jury nine and a half hours to acquit the property developer, of Higher Cowley Farm, Parracombe, near Barnstaple, north Devon, of murder but guilty of manslaughter.

Passing sentence, Mr Justice Butterfield said he was 'wholly unimpressed' with the evidence that Leeman had been affected by the prescription medication he was taking at the time.

'You have been convicted of the manslaughter of your wife and you have pleaded guilty to the possession of a prohibited weapon, a semi-automatic pistol,' the judge said.

'There is no evidence that you were violent towards your wife until the day you killed her and indeed no evidence that you threatened her with violence.

'You were convicted of manslaughter and you had in fact pleaded guilty to that offence once it was added to the indictment.

'You killed your wife without any justification. Your conviction for manslaughter is on the basis that when you killed your wife you had lost your self-control.

'This was a terrible tragedy. It is a tragedy for Jennie Leeman, whose life you took, and for her family.

'A precious life has been needlessly lost and the sentence I am about to impose is in no sense a value of that life.

'Her life was precious and you have taken it from her.

'But my sentence is also informed from my view of the evidence placed before the jury and my assessment of what happened that terrible day.

'It is clear that in the days before the killing you learned that your wife was going to leave you and make a new life with Mr Laramy.

'You loved her and accepted the situation as best you could. It is evidently clear that you became concerned about Mr Laramy upon hearing of the rumours and what your son had told you.

'You became obsessed with the view that Mr Laramy was a paedophile and that your young daughter was going to live with your wife.

'It was false in the extreme but I am satisfied it was a view you genuinely held.'

The judge said Leeman had not lost his self-control when he took the handgun from its hiding place, cleaned it, loaded it and placed it in his pocket to meet his wife on the day he killed her.

'In my view you had probably intended to threaten your wife,' he said.

'You were not out of control when you recovered the gun, you were not out of control when you cleaned it and you were not out of control when you put it in your pocket.

'You took out the loaded gun and pointed it at her. You were not, in my judgment, out of control even though you were in a highly charged emotional state.

'But she laughed at you and you did lose control and pumped five bullets into her at point blank range.'

The judge said that had Leeman been convicted of murder the starting point would have been 30 years in prison.

'In my judgment the degree of provocation was low and your wife presented no threat to you,' he said.

'You acted out of anger and frustration rather than fear. It is clear that your intention when you discharged that weapon was to kill your wife.

'I take into account your conduct immediately after you killed your wife, your lack of previous convictions for violence and your remorse, although how much of that is self-pity is difficult to assess.'

Leeman showed no emotion as he was told he would serve a 12-year sentence for manslaughter to run concurrent with a five-year term for possessing the gun.

The judge explained that the 296 days Leeman had already served in custody would be taken into account and he would spend half the sentence in prison before being released on licence.

In mitigation, Martin Meeke QC told the judge of Leeman’s genuine remorse.

'We cannot add to the facts of the case but we would like to emphasise the defendant’s evidence, the intention to commit suicide and, of course, his comments made to the police, which were of loving his wife, wanting to die and wanting to be with her,' he said.

'We say it was immediate and genuine remorse.'

The trial heard that Mrs Leeman and Mr Laramy started their affair in June last year, having known each other for three years.

The following month, Mr Laramy, a builder, moved into a converted barn at the Leemans’ farm and continued seeing Mrs Leeman.

When the defendant found out about his wife’s affair, she left their home and moved in with Mr Laramy. Six days later, she was dead.

The jury of seven men and five women were told that Mrs Leeman was killed at around 5.30pm on September 18, all five of the shots being fired from close range, with the last two at a distance of less than 1in (2.5cm).

Jurors were told Mrs Leeman had gone to the farm, accompanied by Mr Laramy and two of his children, to return her young daughter to her father.Leeman asked his wife to accompany him to his office for a two-minute chat and they were then seen walking towards a barn.

Mr Laramy then heard raised voices, Mrs Leeman screaming and then gunshots, the court was told.

Geoffrey Mercer QC, prosecuting, said: 'She went with him into the barn and in fact to her death, unaware he had a loaded gun with him.

'Mr Laramy heard arguing and screaming, then a gunshot and then further gunshots.'

The court heard that Mr Laramy told his two sons to run to a neighbouring house to raise the alarm and he then ran to the barn. As he did so, the defendant came out of the barn with the gun in his hand.

The jury heard that Leeman pointed the gun at Mr Laramy and said: 'It should have been you first.'

The court was told that Leeman wanted to speak to his wife because of unfounded rumours that Mr Laramy was a paedophile.

When Leeman was arrested, he told police: 'I did it. She would just not listen.

'I shot the woman I loved because she didn’t do what I wanted.'

He also told the court he said the Lord’s Prayer over his wife’s limp body, before trying to kill himself, though the weapon had no further ammunition.

Members of Mrs Leeman’s family were not in court to see her husband jailed although they attended the trial.

Yesterday, a spokesman for her family said: 'No-one has the right to take another person’s life.

'We, Jennie’s family, feel disappointed and that justice has not been done for such a terrible thing that David Leeman has done to our wonderful daughter, sister and friend to so many people.'
