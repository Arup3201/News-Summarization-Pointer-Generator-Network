Despite having one of the busiest year's of their lives, it appears the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge still manage to relax in front of the television from time to time.

The royal couple - who recently returned from their first official overseas trip to Canada and America - have admitted to enjoying the hit ITV period drama Downton Abbey.

The pair made the confession to talented actress Jessica Brown-Findlay - who plays Lady Sybil Crawley in the show - while at a party in Los Angeles.

TV fans: Prince William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, have revealed they enjoy watching Downton Abbey

The 21-year-old star told the Sunday Express: 'They said they'd watched the show and were excited to see the second series.

'Prince William is very handsome and Kate is a gorgeous girl. They make a perfect couple. They seemed really at ease and so in love.

'I didn’t think when I was watching the wedding at home on TV that I’d get to meet them. I was nervous the whole night, but what an honour! I’ll never forget that.'

The first series of Downton Abbey hit the TV screens last year.

It was watched by 13 million viewers and sold around the world, transforming Miss Brown-Findlay from an unknown actress into a global star.

The show has received 11 Emmy nominations and the second series - which is set during the First World War - will return to the screens in September.

Miss Brown-Findlay's character is the youngest daughter of Lord Grantham, who is played by actor Hugh Bonneville in the show.

And she gave some revealing insights into how Lady Sybil's character will develop during the new series.

'She’s still got that rebellious streak in her,' Miss Brown-Findlay told the paper. 'That doesn’t disappear. But with the weight of the First World War comes a lot more responsibility.

'The biggest change in Sybil is in that young naivety of ‘surely everything could change’. She’s forced through her own will and by circumstance to see and experience the real world outside the house.

'It’s great that my character is developing like that. You don’t often get the chance to do that.'

Meanwhile, this year's Emmy Awards promise to be fascinating as two great dames go head to head in a clash of the costume dramas.

Dame Maggie Smith and Dame Eileen Atkins are both nominated in the category for supporting actress in a mini-series or movie for their roles in Downton Abbey and Upstairs, Downstairs respectively.

Veteran actress Jean Marsh is nominated for lead actress in a mini-series or movie after she reprised her role as Rose Buck in the BBC1 remake of the hit show and is up against London-based American actress Elizabeth McGovern, who plays the Countess of Grantham in Downton Abbey.
