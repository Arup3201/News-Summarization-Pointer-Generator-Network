Police are hunting a thug who spray-painted a Staffordshire Bull Terrier bright pink.

The young male dog - who has since been named Neon - is thought to have been stolen, attacked and them dumped.

The bull terrier's jaws were been tied together before he was daubed with pink and purple paint.

Paint attack: The two-year-old Staffordshire Bull Terrier had his jaw tied shut before being sprayed with pink and purple paint. He was found in Coventry

Police discovered the animal, aged around two or three, wandering the streets in Coventry. He was handed over to a dogs' home where he has been cleaned up.

Darren Calveley, manager of Birmingham Dogs' Home where he is being looked after, said: 'The poor animal has been through so much
caused by pure cruelty and abuse but has remained good natured and will
require rehoming once his wounds have healed and has been given the all
clear by our vet.'

He added that the dog - who is still not completely clean - was in a good condition despite the mis-treatment.

'The dog has been assessed and is 
understandably nervous at first, but once reassured he is extremely 
friendly and loves a fuss,' he said.

'Our canine carers have named him Neon and 
have very much fallen in love with his playful antics.

Julie Gallagher, Coventry City Council's lead animal welfare and pest controller, described the attack as 'incredibly stupid'.

Hunt: Police believe Neon may have been stolen before being 
attacked and dumped. He is being cared for at Birmingham Dogs Home.

'The injuries to his nose are quite fresh. Someone has obviously tied his nose up and sprayed his face,' she said.

'This is an incredibly stupid thing to do. The vet examined him and he's going to be OK though.

'Once his nose has healed a bit more the dogs' home will be able to give him a more thorough wash and get more of the paint off.

'It would've been really unpleasant to have paint sprayed directly into his face and in his eyes.

'Saying that we have had dogs in here
with nail varnish and one dog that had his name spray-painted on one 
side and the owner's mobile phone number spray-painted on the other 
side.'

He was found at around midnight last Friday.

Anyone who recognises the dog is asked to contact Birmingham Dogs Home.
