Hundreds of Olympic spectators were turned away from one of the Games' first events today after a ticketing mix-up before the archery.

Olympic fans had streamed towards Lord's cricket ground early this morning for an event widely advertised as one of the first of the Games, only to be told it was a behind-closed-doors competition.

Dozens of would-be spectators were left angry and frustrated, having thought they could attend a free and unticketed pre-competition 'ranking event'.

Access denied: Archery fans, many of whom had queued from early this morning with what they thought were genuine tickets, were turned away from a ranking event this morning

No entry: A Locog official attempts to calm spectators who had been turned away from the Archery event early this morning

Double disappointment: Fans who could not get in were not only denied entry but also missed out on two world records being set today

But their hopes were dashed when stewards turned them away at the entrance to Lord's, saying that unofficial websites advertising the event were false.

The confusion led to frustration among fans, some of whom had travelled from abroad especially for the archery, only to be denied entry.

A queue of over 50 fans had gathered outside Lord's by 8am this morning, with dozens more who arrived before the 9am start hoping to get in on a 'first come first served' basis.

Some fans even produced what they thought were genuine tickets, purchased from a fraudulent unofficial website.

Among those turned away were four devastated archery fans from Siberia, who had travelled to London solely for today's ranking event.

The four men, part of an amateur archery team, were devastated after dashing to the cricket ground from Heathrow following a 16-hour flight from their homeland just to see the one event.

Speaking on behalf of the men, two of whom were wearing special Olympics T-shirts, volunteer guide Jelena Petrova said: 'They have come from Siberia all the way for this.

'They are very upset - they don't have tickets to see any other events.'

She added: 'These guys have just come off a 16 hour flight at Heathrow this morning and rushed to get here in time. Then the security guard tells us that there's been a miscommunication and non-ticketed also means not open to the public.

'There are people from all over the world turning up here today - it's not good enough.'

There was further confusion as other events, such as the cycling road race and marathon running, allowing spectators to watch for free.

Royal approval: Team GB competitor Larry Godfrey takes a break in the Archery event, which was also watched by Princess Anne

False: Several ticket sites, such as SportTicket Exchange, confused fans by appearing to offer tickets for sale for the behind-closed-doors archery event today

Mix-up: Another website claiming to sell tickets, Global Ticket Market, also appeared to offer admission to the competition today

Many had assumed the archery was following a similar set-up, but the ranking event eventually went ahead with only members of the media watching.

One spectator, Anthony Hunt, had flown in from Mexico especially for the event.

The red-faced blunder for Locog at Lord's was the latest of several slip-ups by organisers before the Opening Ceremony.

On Wednesday, video producers sparked a diplomatic row by mistakenly displaying a South Korean flag during the warm-up of North Korea's women's football match at Hampden Park.

The incident saw North Korea's players walk off the pitch in protest, before the glitch was fixed an hour later.

It is thought a video producer in London - who has since offered to resign - was at fault for the gaffe.

And just yesterday, Olympic programme producers referred to Welsh Team GB footballer Joe Allen as being English.

He told The Times: 'There are some good Mexicans in the archery and I came especially for this day when I saw it advertised as free.

'This is all I have come over for.'

Locog's Lord's venue manager Vanessa Bellamy said: 'This has always been a non-ticketed event but it seems some people believed they could come down on the day.

'This was never the case but we believe some illegal websites may have suggested this was the case.'

Russell Miller, venue general manager for Locog, added: 'It’s a mistake. We are not licensed today. We had never intended to have spectators here and we cannot allow any in.

'We will look into the communications side and I appreciate that this is not an ideal start. I think the publicity has taken on a snowball effect.'

It is unclear from which websites spectators had bought tickets which they produced at Lord's.

A spokesperson for the cricket ground declined to comment.

A
Locog statement later added: 'We think we have made it very clear that 
this is not a free event, like the Road Races or Marathon which have 
been advertised as free events.

'This is a ranking round and there is no spectator access at all.  

'We
are dealing with this at the venue, along with some people who have 
turned up with fake tickets purchased from a fraudulent website.

'Tickets
have not been advertised or sold by LOCOG for the Archery ranking event
which starts today at Lords cricket ground we have always made it clear
that the preliminary rounds are not open for spectators.

Warning: Bosses at Lord's were forced to issue this tweet stating that tickets were not available for the event this morning

World beater: South Korean Im Dong-Hyun, who is legally blind, celebrates after setting a new world record in the men's ranking event this morning

'There are a number of unofficial 
websites claiming to sell tickets, we therefore advise people to be 
extremely cautious and vigilant when attempting to buy tickets and only 
purchase from an official source – if in doubt there is a url checker on
our website which will identify official sources.'

Even
more frustratingly for the fans, the ranking event saw two world 
archery record smashed - including one by a competitor who is blind.

South Korea have claimed the first two world records of London 2012 in the men's archery ranking round.

Im
Dong-hyun broke his own individual record for 72 arrows and joined Kim 
Bubmin and Oh Jin-hyek to set a new team mark for 216 arrows.
