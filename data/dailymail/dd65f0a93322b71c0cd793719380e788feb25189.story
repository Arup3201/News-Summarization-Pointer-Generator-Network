She may now be the Queen of Spain but new pictures of Queen Letizia show she was just like any other student during her university days, taking odd jobs to make ends meet.

Letizia first studied journalism at university in Madrid before taking a masters course at a university in Mexico, where these new pictures reveal she took a job as a hostess promoting a tobacco brand.

The images were taken in the mid-90s while the Queen studied at the University of Guadalajara in Mexico.

New pictures have emerged showing Queen Letizia of Spain during her time studying in Mexico where she took a job promoting a cigarette brand

Letizia can be seen offering information about the Boots tobacco brand and handing out cigarettes to congress visitors

Known as just Letizia Ortiz Rocasolano at the time, the wife of King Felipe VI can be seen in a shirt bearing the name of the 'Boots' brand of tobacco, along with jeans and a red scarf.

The pictures show Letizia smiling as she goes around offering information about the brand and giving out 'Boots' cigarettes to congress visitors to earn some extra cash.

It makes a stark change from today, where Letizia and her husband were on a two-day visit to Morocco on their third foreign visit since he recently became king.

The royal couple were in Rabat, where they visited the Mausoleum of King Mohammed V.

Letizia studied in Mexico after completing a course in journalism in the early 1990s at the University Complutense of Madrid.

After spending time studying in Mexico in the mid-90s, she eventually returned to Spain, where before meeting Prince Felipe, she worked as a newsreader for CNN.

She later went on to become the main anchor on Spain's TVE news programme, which led her to meeting her future husband.

Today Queen Letizia was on a royal visit to Morocco where she was dressed in an elegant white trouser suit and head scarf

They got engaged in 2003 and married in 2004 at Cathedral Santa María la Real de la Almudena in Madrid.

Letizia gave up her high-flying career on marrying Prince Felipe. The couple has since had two children, Infanta Leonor de Todos los Santos of Spain, born 31 October 2005 - who is next in line - and Infanta Sofía de Todos los Santos of Spain, born 29 April 2007.

In June, King Juan Carlos I announced his abdication as king of Spain, handing over the crown to his oldest son Felipe and Letizia, who was once married before and is often described as the 'Spanish Kate Middleton'.
