They are so intricate and colourful they look like they have been painted, but these works of art are actually created out of carefully placed grains fo sand.

Artist Joe Mangrum uses multi-coloured sand to create spectacular artworks anywhere from 15 to 25 feet in size.

Joe has created more than 800 larger than life murals since beginning in 2009.

Sandy Warhol: Joe Mangrum dazzles using coloured sand to create spectacular artworks

Each of his creations can be anywhere between 15 to 25 feet in size - and can be created outside or indoors

Joe has been creating these works since 2009 and approximates he's done about 800 since he first started

The designs - which he creates both indoors and outdoors - take anywhere from six hours to several days to complete.

From Brooklyn in New York, USA, Joe has been creating large-scale installations for more than 15 years.

He previously used flowers and computers but started using sand after hosting a solo show, for which he had to improvise with materials.

'I have one 'brush' - my hand,' Joe explains. He prefers not to use additional tools because it allows him to keep better control

Joe creates different designs based on how he manipulates the speed, flow, and height at which he pours

He said: 'This medium is fascinating because it's so direct.

'I have one 'brush' - my hand - and how I manipulate the flow, the speed and height at which I pour gives it so many dimensions.

'I just start in the centre and start improvising a design.

He starts off in the centre of the design and improvises as he goes, moving outwardÂ 

The medium of creating with sand using only his hands is what fascinates Joe the most. 'It's so direct,' he says

Joe, who is originally from Brooklyn, New York, is inspired by travelling and observing the world

'I have a whole visual library in my photographic memory - from my experience traveling and observing the world, bringing the abstraction to life.

'People of all ages love the colours and the fact that the designs are different every day.'

Joe is currently looking to raise $20,000 through a Kickstarter campaign titled Process into Permanence.

For the project, Joe, 45, will fix coloured sand onto a giant carpet, allowing him to create a permanent sand art fixture.

This sand rug will then be cut into segments and sent to the backers of the campaign.
