Felix Jeronimo Becerra-Gonzalez confessed to robbing two McDonald's including his own place of work, when questioned in custody

A McDonald's manager has allegedly confessed to robbing his own restaurant after being arrested in connection with two holdups of the fast-food chain.

Felix Jeronimo Gonzalez-Becerra, from Oakland, California, was pulled over by police after the San Mateo branch of the fast-food company was robbed at gunpoint.

Staff were forced into the freezers while the masked, gun-wielding robber stole cash from the restaurant, at around 10.30pm September 2.

According to local news service Pleaston Patch, the suspect then fled the scene in a dark coloured Chrysler PT Cruiser.

A police officer pulled over a vehicle matching that description after he spotted it approaching the San Mateo Bridge.  

Driver Gonzalez-Becerra, 42, was arrested and officers recovered money, a replica handgun, a backpack and a black hoodie, the news service said.

The robbery bore similarities to a masked, armed raid on Pleasaton McDonald's, California, five days earlier. This is the branch where Gonzalez-Becerra is the manager.

The robber also forced the employees into the freezer, according to the LA Times.

According to the news services, police said Gonzalez-Becerra, who was booked into San Mateo jail, confessed to robbing both restaurants, including his own, while in police custody.  

Alameda County District Attorney's office is expected to issue criminal charges against Gonzalez-Becerra. It is not known if he still holds his McDonald's job.

McDonald's restaurants at both Pleasanton and San Mateo, California, were robbed in the same way by a masked, armed man within five days of each other
