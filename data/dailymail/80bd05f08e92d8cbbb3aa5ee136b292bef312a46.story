Defence: Lord Saatchi defended his brother Charles today over allegations he grabbed his wife Nigella by the throat

Lord Saatchi has defended his brother Charles over allegations he grabbed his wife Nigella Lawson by the throat, claiming he was the victim of ‘persecution mania’.

Maurice Saatchi said it was impossible for anyone outside of any marriage to know what was really going on – and that would continue to be the case ‘unless CCTV is installed in people’s bedrooms’.

His comments come two months after Nigella and Charles were granted a decree nisi in the High Court – the first legal step to ending their ten-year marriage.

Pictures emerged in June showing Mr Saatchi apparently grabbing her throat during a heated exchange at a Mayfair restaurant.

Since then, the 70-year-old millionaire art collector has accused his wife of ‘illegal acts’, while his daughter Phoebe, 18, said she had felt ‘abandoned’ by her stepmother.

Lord Saatchi, the 67-year-old founder of advertising agency Saatchi and Saatchi, was on The Andrew Marr Show yesterday to discuss his new book Brutal Simplicity of Thought when the host decided to quiz him on his brother’s marriage.

Marr said: ‘I can’t end without asking you about your brother, Charles, who has been through a very torrid time of it, and ask how he is and how you feel he has been treated by the media and public opinion?’

Lord Saatchi appeared to suggest that ‘persecution mania’ had played a role. He said: ‘There are many aspects of human life, let’s consider them – persecution mania, love, sex, marriage, work.

'These are all areas which produce great difficulties in people, and family and marriage is certainly one of the most complex areas.’

Referring to his late wife, Josephine
Hart, he added: ‘As Iris Murdoch said to Josephine Hart on many 
occasions, marriage is a private place. What Iris Murdoch was saying or 
suggesting was that it’s impossible for anybody, even the best friends 
or relatives of the people involved cannot know what really happens 
between a man and a woman.

‘When
somebody installs CCTV in people’s bedrooms, which may be the next step
of our surveillance state, then we’ll have the answer, but until then 
we don’t know.’

Celebrity chef Miss Lawson, 53,  applied to divorce Mr Saatchi  on the grounds of unreasonable behaviour.

He
dismissed the throat-grabbing incident as ‘a playful tiff’ but then 
accepted a police caution for assault. She has denied any illegal 
activity.

Yesterday, 
viewers took to Twitter to criticise Marr’s line of questioning on a 
show which aims to deal with politics and current affairs.

One
wrote: ‘Andrew Marr crosses the line. Invasive cheek asking Maurice 
Saatchi about his brother’s private relationship with wife!’
