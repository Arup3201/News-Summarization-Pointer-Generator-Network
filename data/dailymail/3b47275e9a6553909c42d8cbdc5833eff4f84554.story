A youngster has had his foot and ankle reattached to his thigh back to front, so he can wear a prosthetic leg.

Three-year-old Hamish Hey was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer, which attacks muscle cells and affects just 50 children in the UK each year.

A deadly tumour was detected above his left knee and following intensive chemotherapy he underwent an eight-hour operation to remove the mass.

Using a limb-sparing technique called rotationplasty, surgeons amputated his leg above the knee.

They then rotated the ankle and foot and reattached it to the thigh, forming a knee joint.

The procedure means that Hamish will not be confined to a wheelchair and will be able to walk again when a prosthetic limb is finally attached.

Susan Hey, 33, who has spent months with her son at Glasgow’s Yorkhill Royal Hospital for Sick Children said he had been very brave.

'Hamish is the fourth child in the UK to
have this operation.

'He has astounded everyone 
with his resilience, he’s absolutely amazing.'

Hamish was in the bath with five-year-old sister Lily when his parents noticed a lump just above his knee.

Initially they thought it was a bite 
or an injury suffered as a result of a fall, but a GP advised them to go to Raigmore Hospital.

Hamish was immediately referred to 
Yorkhill and within a week of finding the lump, was diagnosed with 
metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a cancer which attacks muscle cells.

It is so rare, it affects just 50 children in the UK each year.

Hamish was started on a programme of intensive chemotherapy and almost died during the treatment.

'After the first few cycles he had a complication with his liver which started to shut down,' explained Mrs Hey, who has moved the family from their home in Osprey Crescent, Nairn, to Glasgow, so they can be closer to Hamish.

'The cancer was the most aggressive it could possibly be and we didn’t think he was going to make it, it’s amazing he’s still here.'

The chemotherapy shrunk the tumour to the size of a lemon, meaning doctors could proceed with the operation.

He is now recovering well although the cancer has spread to the lungs.

'He’s not out of the woods yet,' Mrs Hey added. “The surgery is a move in the right direction as the primary source of cancer is gone, but he still has some cancer in his lungs.'

Hamish is due to undergo more chemotherapy and radiotherapy this year.
