Small earthquakes linked to energy drilling are shaking Oklahoma and southern Kansas daily and may be dramatically increasing the chance of bigger and dangerous quakes.

This once stable region is now just as likely to see serious damaging and potentially harmful earthquakes as the highest risk places east of the Rockies.

A major quake is still a low risk, about a 1 in 2,500 years' chance of happening, according to geophysicist William Ellsworth of the US Geological Survey.

'To some degree we've dodged a bullet in Oklahoma,' Ellsworth said after a presentation to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Research says small earthquakes shaking Oklahoma and southern Kansas are dramatically increasing the chance of bigger, more dangerous quakes. Above, an Oklahoma man looks at damage from a 2011 quake

The number of earthquakes in Oklahoma has grown dramatically in the last several years, and the state saw 562 in 2014

But, he added, 'This is not to say we expect a large earthquake tomorrow.'

The change in risk puts Oklahoma on par with such areas as New Madrid, Missouri, where residents are warned that a devastating earthquake in 1811 could receive a dangerous aftershock.

During Dr Ellsworth's 90-minute session on human-induced earthquakes, three quakes larger than 3.1 magnitude hit northern Oklahoma. 

Federal records show that since Jan. 1, Oklahoma has had nearly 200 quakes that people have felt. These quakes started to increase in 2008 and made dramatic jumps in frequency in June 2013 and again in February 2014, Dr Ellsworth said.

The state saw three times as many quakes larger than 3,0 magnitude in 2014, according to Reveal News , the most perceptible tremors in the contiguous United States.Oklahoma saw 562 earthquakes to California's 180.

'Yeah, we are shaking all the time ... You put up with a few things falling off your walls, a few nights waking up with the shakes,' Medford Oklahoma City Manager Dea Mandevill told KCUR.

She said that energy drilling had benefited her town economically and did not discuss the possibility of large, damaging quakes.

The Midwestern states' earthquakes are mostly in areas with hydraulic fracturing, a process known as fracking.

Maintenance workers inspect the damage to one of the spires on Benedictine Hall at St. Gregory's University in Shawnee, Okla., after two earthquakes hit the area in less than 24 hours.

Many studies have linked the increase in small quakes to the process of injecting wastewater deep underground because it changes pressure and triggers dormant faults.

Until now, those quakes were mostly thought of as nuisances and not really threats. 

But Dr Ellsworth's continuing study, which is not yet published, showed the mere increase In the number of tiny temblors raises the risk of earthquakes that scientists consider major hazards. 

That's generally above a magnitude 5 with older buildings and a magnitude 6 for modern ones, he said.

'The more small earthquakes we have it just simply increases the odds we're going to have a more damaging event,' Dr Ellsworth said.

A 2011 earthquake in Prague, Oklahoma, was a 5.7 magnitude, causing some damage and hurting two people.

Some studies said that was a side effect of the drilling process, but other scientists are not convinced.

Experts at the science session said Dr Ellsworth's finding of a higher risk for big quakes makes sense.

'We are worried about this, no question about it,' said Rex Buchanan, interim director of the Kansas Geological Survey.

Not all states with fracking and wastewater injections are seeing increased quakes and not all those with increased quakes, such as Texas and Ohio, are at a higher risk for major quakes, Dr Ellsworth said. 

Arkansas and Ohio, for example, are also now seeing fewer man-made quakes, he said.

Areas in the Bakken formation in North Dakota and Canada, where there has been heavy drilling, have also not seen the same increase.

Much depends on geology and how the wastewater is injected, said Stanford University geophysics professor Mark Zoback. 

He said industry and regulators can be smarter about where they inject wastewater and where they do not, and can avoid many of these problems.
