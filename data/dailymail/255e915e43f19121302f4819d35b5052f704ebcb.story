England cricketer Monty Panesar's recent drunken rampage which ended with him urinating on nightclub bouncers was sparked by a bitter divorce from his wife, it was claimed today.

The spin bowler has kept his separation from his wife of three years Gursharan Rattan a secret.

But friends of the star have claimed his recent troubles are a result of his heartbreak over the breakdown of his marriage to the pharmacist.

A source told the Sunday Mirror: 'Monty was devastated by the breakdown of his marriage and is still coming to terms with his recent divorce. His personal struggles have been a direct result of that.

'He did everything he could to make it work,” said the source. But ultimately he felt there were some insurmountable family issues and this became an increasingly difficult factor within the marriage. He is still sad that they couldn’t make it work.'

Panesar's spokesman confirmed the divorce.

The devout Sikh, who is meant to abstain from alcohol under the Sikh code of conduct, was forced to apologise after being fined £90 for his drunken antics at a nightclub in Brighton two weeks ago.

The 31-year-old, who was dropped by England ahead of the Ashes series because of his poor performance, was thrown out of Shooshh on Brighton seafront after a group of young women complained that he was bothering them.

He is believed to have then gone on to the promenade above the club and relieved himself over the doormen below.Witnesses said the bouncers gave chase 
and cornered the cricketer in a pizza restaurant before putting him in 
an arm lock and dragging him back to the venue in tears.

A source added: ‘The bouncers noticed water falling on them – then realised what was happening.

‘They chased Monty into a pizza shop and he was shouting, “Help! Help!”.

‘He struggled a bit and didn’t want to go. But once they had him locked in, he gave up and walked back with them.’

The cricketer, who lives in nearby Hove, was detained for 45 minutes before the police arrived and issued him with a £90 spot fine for being drunk and disorderly.

He had been to a vodka bar before moving on to the club.

Panesar’s spokesman said he did not dispute being fined for his drunken antics and added that he wanted to express his ‘unreserved apologies for any offence caused by his behaviour’.

The sportsman married Gursharan in a traditional Sikh ceremony and the couple moved to Hove in East Sussex when he signed a three-year contract to play for Sussex.

But problems in their marriage soon began to show and he was arrested by police after reports of an argument with his wife in a pub car park two years ago.

He was interviewed before being released without charge.
