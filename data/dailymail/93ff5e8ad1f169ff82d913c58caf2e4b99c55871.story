An anonymous benefactor has been leaving cash hidden all over San Francisco - and inviting strangers to find it via a series of clues.

Using the Twitter handle @HiddenCash, the unnamed individual has left money under chairs and benches in public parks, on stairways and even a unisex bathroom.

Pay it forward: @HiddenCash shared this photo with the message 'Why not use this to tip your @YogaToThePeople teacher this morning? (Find it under the key box)' on Friday

Free money! @HiddenCash captioned this photo 'New drop: Look under me :)' on Friday

Going all over! @HiddenCash dropped off this money in a storage container, a bike rack, and a tree at the Lake Merritt BART station in Oakland on Friday

The user, who calls the program 'an anonymous social experiment for good,' leaves hints by sharing a photo of the drop-off spot, as well as written clue.

'Could you and 25 of your friends use a @Sightglass Coffee? Look in the abandoned phonebox next door,' one tweet said, along with a photo of a $100 bill.

'New drop: look under me :)' said another, which appeared to show a park bench.

Amounts at the drop spots have varied. @HiddenCash has shared uploads of multiple $20bills being tucked away for curious scavengers, as well as $50 and $100 amounts.

As of this writing, @HiddenCash has over 6,500 followers waiting for the next tip.

Generous: @HiddenCash wrote 'New Drop: Popular Chinese place near Market/Kearny in unisex bathroom #payitforward & drop couple 20s to next person' on Friday

Paying the bills! @HiddenCash said he or she left a couple of $20 bills to 'feed' this meter on Friday

The generous donor contacted The Bold Italic, and revealed that he or she became rich through real estate.

'I've made millions of dollars the last few years, more than I ever imagined, and yet many friends of mine, and people who work for me, cannot afford to buy a modest home in the Bay Area,' the person wrote to The Bold Italic. 'This has caused me quite a bit of reflection. I am determined to give away some of the money I make, and in addition to charity, to do it in fun, creative ways like this.'

@HiddenCash said he or she will leave money 'once or twice a week,' the site says.

'This is my way of giving back to the community and also having fun,' the anonymous person said. '[I] was just kicking around ideas with a friend yesterday and we decided to start hiding a bunch of cash in different places around the city.'

'The bigger idea is just to give back, both financially and a sense of fun to the community that has made me wealthy.'

Union Square: The anonymous donor also appeared to leave money by the square's palm trees on Friday

Run to City Hall! @HiddenCash shared this picture of $50 he or she left on the building's steps
