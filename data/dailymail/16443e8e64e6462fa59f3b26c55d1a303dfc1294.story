Condition: Nelson Mandela is still not well enough to leave hospital despite widespread reports that he had been discharged

Nelson Mandela is still not well enough to leave hospital despite widespread reports that he had been discharged, the South African president’s office has said.

Mr Mandela, 95, remains ‘critical but stable’, although at times his condition has become more acute and he has required medical intervention.

His family had hoped that his health would improve sufficiently for him to return to  his specially adapted home in Johannesburg and be cared  for there.

But his condition has continued to fluctuate since he was admitted to hospital in June with a lung infection, which is said to date back to his days in prison.

Around the time of his birthday in July, it was widely feared that Mandela was close to death, and crowds kept a vigil  outside his hospital in Pretoria.

However, he made an unexpected recovery and sources said that last week he was well enough to enjoy the company of the friends and family who have been visiting him.

Mandela’s health was said to have improved so much that he was sitting up and watching television in his hospital bed.

South African president Jacob Zuma has urged his country to pray for Mandela and said his predecessor in the role had shown ‘great resilience’.

However, it is understood  that despite a statement by Mandela’s former wife Winnie that he is breathing normally, he is still sometimes reliant on medical assistance.

One source told The Mail on Sunday that speculation spread because the few details about Mandela’s condition that have been released in recent weeks have been so tightly controlled by his family and the president’s office.

‘There’s been such a news drought on official statements about Mr Mandela’s condition over the summer that rumours are bound to start materialising,’ the source said.
