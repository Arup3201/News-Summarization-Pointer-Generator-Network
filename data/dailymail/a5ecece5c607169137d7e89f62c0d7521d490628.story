Drugs cheats in athletics are running out of ways to escape their fate, according to a leading anti-doping authority.

Abby Hoffman from the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) says that new innovations in technology means cheats who beat the system now will be caught in the future - with no place to hide after samples are retested.

The use of archived samples has already seen 15 athletes retrospectively charged - and Hoffman believes that the new prospect of being caught in future should help stop athletes doping now.

Speaking out: Abby Hoffman hopes that the changes in drug testing will help stop athletics cheats

Talking it through: Having spent years on fighting drugs, four-time Olympian Hoffman has seen a lot

And with competitors facing longer bans as the new four-year penalty for doping offences comes into effect in January - those who try to gain an unfair advantage need to watch their backs.

'The retesting is a really important innovation; the IAAF has been maintaining – that is retaining – samples since 2005, so we have samples from all of the medallists from our major events since 2005,' Hoffman said.

And with reanalysis soon to be allowed up to 10 years (from eight) - there are more opportunities to stop cheats.

Something to get sorted: Drugs in athletics are still a big problem but the changes could put off potential cheats

Innovation: Hoffman spoke about the retesting of samples that will stop today's cheats in years to come

'The purpose of this is as testing science improves we are going back to samples that originally tested negative but now we have new methodology and we’re getting positive test results so this is absolutely critical, she added.

'I think it’s sending a very strong message to any athlete who is tempted to dope that the fact that you might not get caught today is not going to provide you with assurance about something that may happen in the next decade and given the rate of scientific progress I’d be thinking twice myself about doing something if I thought sometime in the next 10 years my sample might be retested.'

The only route out for cheats is admission - as in the case of Tyson Gay, which saw the sprinter have his sentence reduced in a trade-off for information. Gay ended up with a one year ban.

Returning: Tyson Gay only suffered from a one year drugs ban due to his willingness to provide information

Plea: Hoffman and the IAAF are hoping that the changes in the way tests are handled will stop doping

'It sticks in my craw that Tyson Gay only gets the one-year penalty,' Hoffman said.

'There’s a trade-off: If we want to get information and intelligence that will help us better manage and curtail doping, then we’re going to have to bite our tongue, hold our nose, and a guy like Tyson Gay is going to get a penalty that is going to be reduced to one year.

'Under the new code he might not get a penalty all the way back to a single year.' 

Changing times: If Gay was caught next year under the new rules he might not get off as lightly
