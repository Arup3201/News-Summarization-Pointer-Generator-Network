Controversial crack cocaine-smoking mayor Rob Ford has been filmed dancing bizarrely in front of a gospel congregation.

As he swayed with parishioners, many shouted ‘hallelujah’ at the predominantly black West Toronto Church of God, while one churchgoer suggested that Toronto mayor Ford ‘smells like ganja’.

The video posted on YouTube comes after Ford, 49, admitted he had smoked crack cocaine and was stripped of most of his mayoral powers by the Toronto City Council when he refused to resign.

Hallelujah: Toronto Mayor Rob Ford (far right) was filmed dancing bizarrely in front of a congregation at the West Toronto Church

According to the NY Daily News, Jamal Lewis wrote on Twitter, ‘Man smells like ganja,’ along with a photo of himself and Ford with another churchgoer.

Dressed in a suit, Ford seemed to be enjoying himself, dancing and waving his hands.

The church appearance has come just days after Ford’s supporters launched a website to raise $50,000 to help him 
pay mounting legal bills.

In the headlines: The video was posted after he admitted that he had smoked crack cocaine and was stripped of most of his mayoral powers by the Toronto City Council when he refused to resign

In response to the video, one wrote on Twitter: ‘Say whatever u want, no one sweats for his constituents like Rob Ford. No one.'

Another posted: ‘By my count Rob Ford has now busted through about 20 hours worth of alcoholic "moments of clarity".’

Mayor Ford first made headlines in 
October when Toronto police chief Bill Blair announced they had a video 
which showed Ford smoking from a crack pipe. 

Initially, Ford denied that he had ever smoked crack and refused to resign. But
 on November 5, Ford admitted that he had smoked crack-cocaine in the 
past, maintaining that he is not addicted to the substance.

'Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine but... am I an addict? No. Have I tried it? Um, probably in one of my drunken stupors, probably approximately about a year ago.' 

Since then, Ford has been a constant headline fixture as his public behavior spiraled out of control and the Toronto City Council voted to remove his special privileges and reduce his office budget.

Revealing interview: In an interview with Canadian journalist Conrad Black (right), Ford (left) said he had not drunk alcohol for several weeks

But perhaps Ford's most embarrassing gaffe was when he described allegations that he made passes at a staffer, Olivia Gondek. 

'It says that I wanted to eat her p****. I would never do that. I'm happily married. I've got more than enough to eat at home, thank you very much,' he said in a press conference on November 14. 

Ford was forced to hold another press conference later in the day in order to apologize for his lewd language earlier.

In a revealing interview to disgraced Canadian journalist Conrad Black which aired last week, Ford said that he had not drunk alcohol for several weeks.

He said: 'I haven't had a drop of alcohol in five weeks. 

'I was never an alcoholic. But you know, I'd like to have a few drinks on the weekends, like I think a lot of people do. 

'But a couple of times I made a fool of myself, if you want to be frank.'
