The battle over homegrown players overshadowed the Premier League, FA and Government’s get-together on Friday in a fanciful show of harmony to promote grassroots facilities.

The League’s opposition to FA chairman Greg Dyke’s campaign to increase the homegrown players in their squads from eight to 12 made pictures of Dyke, PL chief executive Richard Scudamore and Minister for Sport Helen Grant at a new 3G pitch in Brixton rather incongruous, especially as how the money will be spent or who will administer it has not been decided.

‘The nitty gritty will be worked out,’ promised Grant on her last day in office before the election, just when she’s starting to looking the part.

The PL want to kick Dyke’s project into the long grass, claiming it will never get through the necessary committees on which the League have seats.

Dyke has ridden back from his aggressive approach on Monday when he said the FA had looked into forcing change but did not want to do so. When Southampton asked Dyke at the clubs’ summit if he was going to force it through — as the FA could — he denied he’d said that.

Instead, there will be a consultation process with an FA document arriving soon which the PL and their clubs will inevitably reject. Scudamore said: ‘We haven’t actually seen the consultation document, we haven’t seen the process. When that arrives, we will consult properly on it.’

The FA’s best hope is that UEFA can persuade the European Commissioner to allow 12 home-grown players in Champions League squads.

The non-stop spin about who’s giving what to grassroots football was in full force. Scudamore, Dyke and Grant were each accompanied by at least two of their PR team or policy advisors, all spinning like tops over a supposedly joint initiative. It was likened to a three-legged stool by Scudamore, who added: ‘They fall over if any one of the legs gets sawn off.’

The three speeches at the UEFA Congress from Sepp Blatter’s challengers for the FIFA presidency do not seem to have had much impact on voters. According to his supporters, Blatter  is still on course for a ridiculous fifth term in office with a landslide 160 territories out of 209, which explains why he doesn’t feel the need to go out on the campaign trail. That support includes around half of the UEFA countries, which is the percentage estimated by the Slovenia and Iceland delegations in Vienna.

FA of Wales’ loveable loose cannon president Trefor Lloyd Hughes gave the impression he didn’t really know where he stood at the UEFA Congress over his noisy claims to the British vice-presidency on the FIFA ExCo because it was Wales’s turn. And this was borne out by his official FAW statement congratulating the successful candidates after the elections in ‘Vienna, Switzerland’.

FA cutting to the Max

The FA’s desire to find 15 per cent cuts from every department to fund the England commission coaches and pitches initiative doesn’t stop them bringing in costly management consultants Maxxim to find more efficient ways for football’s ruling body to work.

Complaints from the national game about the proposed cuts to the FA Trophy and Vase prizemoney brought the FA board response that sponsors should be found by the commercial department. Hardly likely when the flagship FA Cup has been without a backer all season.

Four second places in the Six Nations is not stopping England head coach Stuart Lancaster talking about coming first for a change. His latest speaking engagement, for the NSPCC, is a glitzy evening with himself and Jonny Wilkinson at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London on April 23 talking to 450 guests about ‘What it takes to Win’. Whether it’s advisable, even for a good cause, for Lancaster, with his track record, to be talking in tandem with a fabled World Cup winner is debatable.

The ECB are negotiating a car deal for England with Toyota set to replace Jaguar. And if Kevin Pietersen does return, he should be required to arrive at matches in a Toyota. He famously annoyed Jaguar by refusing to drive their car when on a central contract because he wouldn’t commit to sponsors’ player appearances.
