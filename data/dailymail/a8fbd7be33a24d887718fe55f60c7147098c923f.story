Owen Farrell has been ruled out of the third Test against New Zealand in Hamilton on Saturday with a knee injury – leaving Freddie Burns on course to reclaim the England No 10 shirt.

The RFU confirmed on Tuesday morning that Farrell sustained a strained medial ligament in his left knee during the 28-27 second Test defeat in Dunedin last weekend and he will not be available for the series finale. It is a major disappointment for the 22-year-old, who missed the first clash with the All Blacks in Auckland due to his involvement in the Aviva Premiership Final.

Injury blow: Owen Farrell will play no further part in the series after damaging his knee

Below par: The Saracens man was not at his best last weekend, picking up a yellow card

Revealing the bad news about the Saracens stand-off, England head coach Stuart Lancaster said: ‘The knee has been scanned and there is a strain there. It’s disappointing for Owen as he was desperate to play in the final Test but such is his character that he is already working on his rehab and still contributing to the tour.

‘Fortunately we have three other fly-halves to call on and we’ll make that selection call over the next few days. The squad trained well this morning and we will narrow down selection over the next 24 hours following the game this evening.’

Burns produced a superb performance at Eden Park, in his first Test appearance for a year, and Leicester’s new recruit from Gloucester is certain to take on the playmaker’s role again. Yet, his return to the starting XV will leave a bench place up for grabs, with Danny Cipriani seemingly ahead of Stephen Myler in the tussle to fill it.

England’s injury problems appear to be easing somewhat, as centres Billy Twelvetrees and Luther Burrell – who picked up ankle knocks in Dunedin – both trained on Tuesday. However, there remain doubts about first-choice scrum-half Danny Care’s chances of shaking off a shoulder problem in time to play in Hamilton.
