Five teenagers have been arrested after a 600-person brawl erupted outside a Florida cinema on Christmas night.

The fight allegedly began when a group of young people stormed Jacksonville's Hollywood River City 14 without paying about 8.30pm, prompting a security guard to pepper spray the youths.

The scene turned to chaos when hundreds of people began fighting, yelling and jumping on cars in the parking lot, with 60 police officers called in to curb the melee.

Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Lauri-Ellen Smith said the security guard, who was an off-duty cop, called for police back-up after being rushed by the group.

'(The officer) administered pepper spray to disperse the group, locked the doors and called for backup, following protocol,' she told ABC News. 

'(That's when) upward of 600 people moving throughout a parking lot about the size of a football field began fighting, disrupting and jumping on cars.'

She said 62 police officers 'sequestered and separated' the rioters over about 90 minutes, with only minor injuries and damage reported.

Witness Alecia Williams said she was on her way to the movies with a friend when police turned her around.

'I saw a whole bunch of people fighting,' Williams told the Florida Times-Union. 'I got out of there as fast as I could. I got really scared.'
