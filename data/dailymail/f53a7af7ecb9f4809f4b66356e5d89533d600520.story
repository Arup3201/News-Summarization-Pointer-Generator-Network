Police have been accused of ignoring a whistleblower's warning about a paedophile care home boss - allowing him to carry on abusing boys for an extra ten years.

John Allen was yesterday found guilty of committing historical sexual abuse against 18 boys and one girl aged between seven and 15 at his residential care home in Wrexham, north Wales.

But today it has emerged that the finance officer at the care home, Des Frost, alerted police as long ago as 1980 after six youngsters complained about Allen's abuse.

Mr Frost said detectives visited him after he reported the matter, but that the claims were dismissed.

Allen, now 73, continued to carry out abuse at the Bryn Alyn care home until the early 1990s - a decade later.

Mr Frost, 75, told Walesonline.co.uk: 'My generation look on the police as very responsible people. I wrongly assumed they would do something about my report.

'I’m so disappointed nothing was done. If police had acted, 10 years of terrible sexual abuse could have been stopped. I thought they would challenge Allen about this. They didn’t.'

Allen was told he must spend at least 11 years behind bars for committing 'grave' offences against children at the care home he ran in Wrexham.

Mr Frost, a married father of four, accused police of  failing to prevent ten more years of abuse saying his report to police 'should have sounded alarm bells' because he was a senior member of staff at the home.

The accountant was living over the border in England when he said he told two detectives from Cheshire about his concerns that abuse was taking place and that he was told the allegations would be referred to the neighbouring force.

Walesonline quotes Detective Chief Superintendent Wayne Jones, from North Wales Police, as saying: 'All material in relation to any allegations made during that period has been given to the Op Pallial team.'

The website says neither force has been able to comment on any alleged wrongdoing.  

Cheshire Police said they were unable to find Mr Frost's report because it pre-dated computer records. 

A spokesman said that normal procedure would have meant they could presume the matter would have been passed to North Wales Police.

The National Crime Agency says it has spoken to Mr Frost. 

Mold Crown Court heard how Allen's victims considered him 'untouchable' over decades of sustained abuse as they had no one to report his behaviour to while under his care.

Yesterday, they hugged one another and their families after seeing the sex offender jailed, with one man telling how he felt as though his 'life sentence' had been lifted.

Allen denied all offences during the six week trial to the shock of complainants present at the sentencing.

He was given a discretionary life sentence for seven serious sexual assaults and received concurrent terms of 10 years for 23 indecent assaults. One count of gross indecency with a child brought a sentence of two years.

He was cleared of two other serious sexual assaults. 

Allen had already spent six years in jail over abuse in the 1970s and avoided prosecution in 2003 over more alleged attacks when legal proceedings collapsed.

In 1995, after Allen was jailed for the first time, an inquiry was launched to look at the abuse of children in Gwynedd and Clwyd areas.

Following its publication in 2000, more complainants came forward with claims they had been abused by the 73-year-old. 

But the case was stunted by a Crown Court judge who reportedly ruled that Allen would not receive a fair trial because of the publicity about his previous convictions. 

In 2012 he was arrested amid fresh allegations and found guilty last week of 33 offences against young boys and one against a girl.
