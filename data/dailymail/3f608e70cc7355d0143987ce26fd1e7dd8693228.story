There's a good chance that the only person more upset that the Denver Broncos lost this year's Super Bowl than quarterback Peyton Manning is the owner of a chain of furniture stores in Texas - Manning may have lost the game, but Jim 'Mattress Mack' McIngvale nearly lost his shirt.

Thanks to a promotion McIngvale ran at his chain of Houston-based furniture stores, he's out $7 million after the Broncos were blown out by the Seattle Seahawks in Sunday night's Super Bowl.

McIngvale's company, Gallery Furniture, is one of the largest chains of independent furniture stores in the U.S. And McIngvale is well-known around Houston for both his philanthropy and flamboyant promotions.

'Mattress Mack': Jim McIngvale is paying out $7 million in refunds to customers because the Seahawks won the Super Bowl

So, for Sunday's big game, McIngvale  promised customers who spent at least $6,000 in the past two weeks and 
took delivery before Sunday's game that he'd refund their purchase cost 
if Seattle won.

Seattle didn't just win, the Seahawks embarrassed the Broncos in one of the biggest blowouts in Super Bowl history.

A man of his word, McIngvale says he plans to pay up.

'The accountant is pulling his hair out this morning, but the customers 
are happy and that’s what’s most important,' McIngvale said to ABC News.

McIngvale  said Monday that his accountant told him the latest promotion was a 'crazy idea' and now the accountant is 'pulling his hair out.' In the long run, though, the businessman thinks the promotion will pay off.

'[The promotion] worked for making the customer say "This guy does what he says he’s going to do,’” McIngvale said.

Bad news: McIngvale says his accountant is 'pulling his hair out' but that he plans to honor the promotion

In all, he says, more than 1,000 customers will receive an average refund of about $7,000 from the promotion.  His insurance does not cover the losses.

The past NFL season already has cost McIngvale more than half-a-million dollars following a similar promotion.

After the AFC and NFC Championship games, Gallery Furniture paid a total of $685,000 to 100 customers who picked the Seahawks and the Broncos to make it to the Super Bowl.

In a similar promotion, a car dealership in Missouri lost more than $300,000 in this year's Super Bowl.

Promotions: McIngvale says the promotion was still a success because customers know that he is a man who honors his word

As part of a promotion, the Hutcheson Ford dealership in St. James, Missouri, 
offered potential customers the deal of a lifetime in its 'Super Weekend
 Sale': If a player returns an opening kickoff for a touchdown in the 
first or second half of the Super Bowl, anyone who bought a vehicle 
between January 29 and February 1 would receive a refund of the purchase
 price of the vehicle.

Unfortunately for the dealership, 12 
people bought vehicles between the 29th and the 1st - and Percy Harvin 
returned the opening kickoff of the second half 87 yards for a 
touchdown.

'We're like "Oh, my gosh," there's this five percent chance of this 
happening, and it just blew up in our faces,' Kathleen Frazier, 
marketing manager for the dealership, told ABC17News.

Philanthropist: McIngvale is well-known around Houston for his flamboyant promotions and his charity work

In all, the dealership ended up paying 12 customers more than $300,000 for purchases ranging from $10,000 to $50,000.

McIngvale says he plans to hand over the cash during a celebratory party at one of his stores on February 17.
