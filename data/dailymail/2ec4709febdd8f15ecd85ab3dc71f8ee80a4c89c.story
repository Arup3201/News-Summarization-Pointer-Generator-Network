Authorities are searching for a 7-month-old infant after a pickup truck, carrying the baby, rolled into a Florida river.

A 46-year-old man held his infant nephew in the bed of the pickup truck parked on the edge of the Withlacoochee River in Dade City, with the truck's rear facing into the water, according to theTampa Bay Times. 

The man and the infant were among relatives having a picnic at the river's edge when the pickup rolled down a steep embankment, carrying the two into the river at around 6pm.

Truck: The man was pinned under the truck's engine block as he struggled to jump to shore while holding his nephew

The man tried to save the baby by jumping to shore, but was pulled under water. The truck toppled over and the man was  pinned beneath the  engine block, the Times reports.

Panicked family members jumped into the river but could not find the man or the baby.  

Pasco County deputies responded around 6.30pm and found the man's body underneath the half-submerged truck 30 minutes later, WTSP reports. 

Deputies continued searching for the infant throughout the night, the Times reports, but their search was hindered due to strong river currents, darkness, and alligators. 

The Pasco County Dive Team and Marine Unit, along with officers with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission are continuing the search for the infant.

The commission had alligator traps on hand as they searched the river as the six-person dive team searched around the truck. The truck was pulled from the river at around 10pm.

Authorities say that what was once a life-saving mission has now become a recovery mission for the body of the baby boy, ABC reports.

The identities of the man and the infant have not been made public.

The incident began as an outing, with the man, his nephew, and more than 50 family members and friends spending the day at the Withlacoochee River Park, according to the Times.

When the park closed, the family parked their pickup at the river's edge and let down the tailgate at the private picnic area.

Soon, what was once a fun-filled day at the park turned into a tragedy.

Melanie Snow, Pasco sheriff's spokeswoman, told the Times Sunday that though conditions may be difficult, there are no plans to call off the search for the 7-month old boy. 

The searched continued Monday morning.  

'At this point we have no plan to call off the search,' she said. 

'We'll keep searching until we find the baby.'
