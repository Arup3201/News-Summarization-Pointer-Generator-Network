Emily Cooper had only just called an ambulance for her pregnant sister who had begun having contractions when a shout from the other room.

The baby was already coming into the world - and fast.

The whirlwind of emotions that the 24-year-old went through as she then proceeded to deliver her sister's baby on the bathroom floor of her Toowoomba home in Queensland – from panic, to sheer joy and relief – can be clearly heard throughout the 10 minute recording of her phone conversation with an emergency medical dispatch officer.

'I didn't know what to do or think – it was just crazy and so astonishing to see this baby coming out,' the mother-of-three told Daily Mail Australia.

'She [Ms Cooper's sister, Liza Chilly] was freaking out and in a lot of pain, but there's nothing much you can do. She was overwhelmed with excitement and there were so many emotions going at once.

'The whole time I was just looking at her in disbelief and we were smiling and laughing and crying at each other – it was an amazing experience.'

Ms Cooper and her sister, who has two other young children, had been expecting to have a quiet afternoon together on Sunday when a stroll to the bathroom quickly led Liza to realise she was actually in labour.

At the start of her telephone call to the ambulance, Ms Cooper can be heard telling the medical officer: 'My sister, she's pregnant and she's a week overdue, so she's having some contractions one minute apart now.'

Within the first minute of conversation, Ms Cooper was asked if she can see any part of the baby, to which she confidently replied 'no'.

Less than 20 seconds later, a loud scream is heard in the background and her sister is heard yelling: 'She's coming!'.

'Yep, she's in labour now and the baby's pushing out right now!' Ms Cooper is heard laughing.

'I see a big…oh, her head!' she added in worried tone. 

The officer can then be heard instructing her caller how to safely deliver her niece on the bathroom floor.

'With each contraction place the palm of your hand and apply firm but gentle pressure to the baby's head, to prevent it from delivering too fast and tearing her,' she said.

'As the baby delivers, support the baby's head and shoulders and hold its hips and legs firmly. Now remember the baby will be slippery so don't drop it.'

Meanwhile Ms Cooper, who is clearly in shock, reports that by two minutes into their conversation the baby's head and arms could be seen, followed by her body and legs less than 45 seconds later. 

'The whole time I was just looking at Liza in disbelief and we were smiling and laughing and crying at each other – it was an amazing experience,' Ms Cooper said

Just before the three minute mark, Ms Coopers panicked voice announced: 'She's moving she's moving, she's crying now.'

Thirty seconds later, the simultaneous sound of the crying newborn, named Summer Rose Chilly, and a woman can be heard before the officer eventually admits 'the baby certainly does have a very healthy set of lungs – that's terrific'.

Paramedics arrived shortly afterwards to assist them with the final stages of the birth and allowed Ms Cooper to cut Summer's umbilical cord. 

But it was Christine Phillips, the emergency medical dispatcher who provided step-by-step instructions during the birth, whom Ms Cooper believes saved the day. 

'We spoke to her at the hospital – she came up with flowers and congratulated us. I wouldn't have been able to do it without her,' she said.

Within two minutes of her conversation with the emergency medical dispatcher, Ms Cooper (pictured with one of her own daughters) could be heard saying that the baby's head and arms could be seen, followed by her body and legs less than 45 seconds later
