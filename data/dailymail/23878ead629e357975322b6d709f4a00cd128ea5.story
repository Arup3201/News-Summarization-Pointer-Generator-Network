New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced the state will legalise medical marijuana use

It will soon be possible to get high for medical reasons in New York State - but smoking the drug will remain prohibited.

Governor Andrew Cuomo has announced legislation to make New York the 23rd U.S. state to legalise marijuana use for medicinal purposes.

However, users will have to vaporize or ingest it through food or pills.

Not only does the new law make the region one of the largest states to allow the use of medical marijuana, it also cements its status as one of the country's more fiercely smoke free.

New York has enacted in recent years several crackdowns restricting the areas in which people can smoke tobacco.

Under the Bloomberg Administration, a 2011 bill was enacted banning smoking in public areas such as parks, beaches and boardwalks, sports stadiums and pedestrian plazas. This was then recently extended to include e-cigarettes.

Governor Cuomo's marijuana announcement stated acquiring the drug would involve a certification and registry process and will be available to people suffering from cancer, HIV/AIDS, Parkinson's Disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, inflammatory bowel disease, Huntington's Disease and more.

Registry cards will be provided for patients who qualify for the programme and no-one would be able to possess more than a 30 day supply at once.

Governor Cuomo said the rules struck the right 'balance' juggling helping those in pain and suffering and avoiding risks to public health.

'Medical marijuana has the capacity to do a lot of good for a lot of people who are in pain and suffering, and are in desperate need of a treatment that will provide some relief,' he said. 'At the same time, medical marijuana is a difficult issue because there are risks to public health and safety that have to be averted.

'I believe this bill is the right balance, and I commend the members of the legislature who worked so hard on this measure.'

The drug will be available to those suffering from often painful illnesses, but they will not be able to smoke it
