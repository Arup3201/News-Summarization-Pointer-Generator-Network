Fresh from leading his Chelsea team to a win against Derby County, John Terry celebrated making the Capital One Cup semi-final by taking his family to Winter Wonderland.

The Chelsea defender took to Instagram to show off a selfie with him and his family a day after Jose Mourinho's men won 3-1 over Championship outfit Derby.

'Great day at Winter Wonderland today with the family. Daddy can you come on the Waltzer. Mummy will #screamifyouwannagofaster' wrote Terry with the snap.

Derby are hunting for promotion to the Barclays Premier League and were given a taste of what they could face next year if they're successful in doing so.

Chelsea's Eden Hazard, Filipe Luis and Andre Schurrle were the scorers for Mourinho, while Craig Bryson managed a consolation for the home side.

Terry will face Liverpool next after the draw was made, with Tottenham against Sheffield United.
