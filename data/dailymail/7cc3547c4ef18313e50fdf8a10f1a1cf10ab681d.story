A decade before Gone Girl, the nation was captivated by a strikingly similar story of an adulterous husband who killed his pregnant wife in cold blood. But this wasn't any crime novel - it was a real-life horror. 

Scott Peterson was found guilty in 2003 of murdering his wife Laci and their unborn son Conner, and it was Peterson's mistress Amber Frey that helped put him behind bars. 

Now, ten years later, Frey is speaking out about her relationship with Peterson and how she has tried to distance herself from the infamous case.

Dark times: Amber Frey (pictured) spoke to Inside Edition this week about her relationship with Scott Peterson, who was sentenced to death ten years ago for the murder of his wife Laci Peterson

Scary situation: Frey started dating Peterson (left) around the time that his wife Laci (right) went missing. Laci's remains, as well as those of their unborn child, were discovered in April 2013 and her husband was arrested

Frey spoke with Inside Edition on February 10 - her 40th birthday - and revealed that she is now a single mom to a young daughter and son and is still working as a massage therapist. She also travels doing missionary work for her church. 

As for her feelings about Peterson, she says those are long gone. 

'That was put behind me so many years ago,' Frey said. 

When asked if she has anything left to say to Peterson, Frey responds: 'I really don't have anything to say.' 

New life: Today, Frey is a single mother to two young children and often travels the world performing charity for her church

But the case continues to haunt her. 

'It didn't matter if I had a hat on, glasses, people still recognized me years later.'

Frey started dating Peterson during the 2002 holidays, right around the time that his wife Laci went missing on Christmas Eve. 

When they first met Frey was under the impression that Peterson wasn't married. But she soon found out that he was and that his wife was missing. She agreed to help police in their investigation by having her phone conversations recorded.

Too close: Frey was a witness in Peterson's murder trial. She helped investigators by recording her conversations with Peterson when he was just a suspect. Pictured on the left promoting a book about the experience. Peterson's 2011 mugshot on the right

It wasn't until April though that Peterson was arrested in connection to her murder, when the butchered parts of Laci and her fetus' body parts washed up on the San Francisco Bay shoreline. 

Perhaps most jarring was the fact that when Peterson was arrested, he had changed his entire look and was found driving a car packed with knives, a shovel and directions to Frey's workplace - suggesting that she might be his next target. 

'It was creepy,' Frey recalls. 

Peterson is currently on death row, after a jury found him guilty in Laci's murder in 2004, but he is currently appealing the decision.
