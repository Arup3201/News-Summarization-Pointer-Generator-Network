She's the world's highest-paid supermodel with a figure that most of us can only dream of.

And this summer Gisele Bundchen is showing off her million-dollar curves in all their glory as the face and body of H&M's latest swimwear campaign.

The Brazilian beauty, 33, shows off washboard abs and golden limbs as she works her magic in front of the camera, and may well find herself stuck onto the fridges of women everywhere as today has been identified as the official date when most of us will start our 
beach body countdown.

The campaign was captured by fashion photographer Lachlan Bailey with styling headed up by George Cortina, hair by James Pecis and makeup by Yadim.

In addition 
to showcasing her toned and tanned bikini body in the stunning swimwear 
shoot, the catwalk queen has recorded a cover of iconic Blondie track 
Heart Of Glass for the advert.

The song was produced by acclaimed French DJ Bob Sinclair who worked alongside Gisele for the remix of the 1979 track.

Surrounded by a wall of speakers, the wind whips at the model's gorgeous luxurious mane as she prances about in an animal-print two piece.

Displaying her incredible beach body, the mother-of-two croons into a microphone as the ocean can be seen as a backdrop behind her.

And Gisele seemed pretty happy with the results as she encouraged fans to take a look at her video on Instagram.

She wrote: 'Here I am again... new song with @bobsinclaireofficial and
 @hm, soundtrack for the summer. Out soon, hope you like it!'

In fact, the model may soon be looking to change her career as this is not the first time she has jumped in front of a microphone.

Last year the star recorded another cover for H&M doing the iconic Kinks hit All Day And All Night. The record was made available on iTunes and raised money for charity.

H&M's
