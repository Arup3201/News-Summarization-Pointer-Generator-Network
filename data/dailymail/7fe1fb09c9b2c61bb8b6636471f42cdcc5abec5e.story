Stevan Jovetic has revealed he rejected a move to Roma to sign for Manchester City.

The Montegrin striker joined Manuel Pellegrini's side from Fiorentina for £25.8million last summer.

After 40 goals in 134 appearances for Fiorentina, Jovetic was wanted by a number of top clubs.

But the 25-year-old is happy he chose to move to the Etihad.

He said: ‘It's probably true (that Roma tried to sign me). There were many clubs after me. Roma are a big club but in the end I decided to sign for City and I'm very happy with my decision.’

City are in the Eternal City ahead of their Champions League decider with Roma and Jovetic is desperate to show the Italians what they missed out on.

He said: ‘I want to score. Its my duty to score. I've played a few games in this stadium and scored some goals against them, we won 2-1 a few years ago (for Fiorentina) and I also made one. I try to do the same again. It will be a nice, warm (think he means intimidating) atmosphere, but we are used to it.’
