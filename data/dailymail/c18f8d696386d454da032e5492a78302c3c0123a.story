A private Pennsylvania college expelled three students who made racist comments and used a slur during a late-night campus radio broadcast.

Bucknell University president John Bravman said in a email that he would share the comments made by the students, a DJ and two guests,  in the 'interest of transparency and candor'.

Bravman said one of the students used the N-word during the March 20 WVBU-FM broadcast. Another student said 'black people should be dead' and a third said 'lynch 'em'.

Private Pennsylvania college Bucknell University expelled three students who made racist comments, including 'black people should be dead' and 'lynch 'em', and the N-word during a campus radio broadcast

The university has not released the names of the expelled students. 

Bravman revealed the expulsions in a late-night email sent to students, faculty and staff on Monday. 

'Their conduct is an affront to our values, damaging to our community and in clear violation of our community standards,' he wrote .

Bucknell spokesman Andy Hirsch said that the incident didn't come to the administration's attention until last Thursday, according to PennLive.com. 

It was an inmate at the nearby Lewisburg federal penitentiary who heard the students' comments and brought them to light.

Hirsch said the inmate reported the broadcast to  the Lewisburg Prison Project, a prisoner advocacy group. 

The group contacted a university faculty member, who then reached out to the student-run radio station's adviser.

According to Hirsch, the three students were suspended and interviewed before the dean of students decided to expel them.   

'I would emphasize that the context really doesn't matter once you see what was said,' Hirsch said.

The spokesman declined to say if alcohol was involved, noting the investigation is not complete.

'I can tell you that there were other people at the station,' he said. 

'Whether or not they were there at the time when this happened, we're still looking into all those details.'

The Bucknell student body is 79 per cent white, five per cent Hispanic, four per cent Asian and three per cent African-American. 

After the comments were revealed last Thursday, Bravman sent a message to the entire campus community declaring the behavior 'unacceptable and inexcusable'.   

'This is not who we are,' he wrote. 

'In fact, it is the antithesis of what so many of our students, faculty and staff are working hard to attain - a more diverse and inclusive environment.' 

'I urge you to defy this detestable conduct by not letting it thwart our progress toward a greater Bucknell.'
