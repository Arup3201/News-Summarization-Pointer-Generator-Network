Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said they are working with NHS employers to minimise the impact on patients if a planned four-hour strike goes ahead

NHS staff in England have voted to strike for four hours next month in a row over pay, in what will be the first walkout by health workers in 32 years.

Unions are in dispute over the Government's refusal to accept a recommended one per cent pay rise for NHS workers.

Unison, which represents 300,000 NHS staff in England, announced today their members have voted in favour of action. 

Several other unions are balloting  health staff - including midwives - for industrial action, with more expected to join in on October 13 from 7am to 11am.

It is thought up to 500,000 NHS staff represented by nine unions could take part in the planned walk out. 

Unison members have also voted in favour of four days of industrial action from October 14 to October 17 - when staff will be called on to take their breaks. 

An industrial action ballot saw 68 per cent of members vote in favour of strike action, and 88 per cent opting for action short of a strike. 

Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: 'NHS members don't take action often or lightly. 

'For many of our members, this will be the first time they walk out as the last action over pay was 32 years ago. 

'The NHS runs on the goodwill of its workers, but this Government has shown utter contempt for them.

'We are working with NHS employers to minimise the impact on patients. 

'But it's not too late for Jeremy Hunt  to act to avoid this and we repeat our offer to the Government to negotiate with us, despite him refusing to meet with health unions about pay.' 

The Department of Health said they are 'disappointed' Unison has rejected proposals to give NHS staff at least one per cent extra pay this year and at least a further one per cent next year.

A spokesman said they are keen to speak with union representatives to work to make the NHS pay system 'fairer and more affordable'.

The action will lead up to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) demonstrations in London and Glasgow on October 18. 

Unison is demanding proper funding for the NHS, to ensure the health service has enough staff who are well motivated and fairly paid.

They are calling for an immediate payment of one per cent consolidated sum to every member of NHS staff, as recommended by the NHS Pay Review Body.

Union bosses also want to see the living wage of £7.65-an-hour for low paid staff, an above inflation pay rise for the next financial year and a committment to future pay rises that will restore the value of NHS pay.

Unison's head of health Christina McAnea, added: 'We know health workers don't take strike action lightly or often.

As well as a four-hour strike on October 13, Unison, which represents 300,000 NHS staff in England, said its members will take action from October 14 to 17 - ensuring all staff take their regular breaks (File picture) 

'The last action over pay was 32 years ago.

'But we also know a demoralised and demotivated workforce isn't good for patients.'

In addition to the strike action on October 13, members in the Ambulance Service will be called on to work no overtime from October 14 to 17. 

Other unions are in the process of balloting their members on the same issues and should make their results clear in the next two weeks, Unison said.

Unison members in Wales will ballot in a separate dispute between September 30 and October 20.  

A Department of Health spokesman said: 'We are disappointed that Unison is planning industrial action and has rejected our proposals to give NHS staff at least one per cent additional pay this year and at least a further one per cent next year.

'NHS staff are our greatest asset and we know they are working extremely hard. 

'This is why despite tough financial times, we've protected the NHS budget and now have 13,500 more clinical staff than in 2010.

'We want to protect these increases and cannot afford incremental pay increases - which disproportionately reward the highest earners - on top of a general pay rise without risking frontline NHS jobs.

'We remain keen to meet with the unions to discuss how we can work together to make the NHS pay system fairer and more affordable.'  

If the planned strike goes ahead it will be the first time NHS staff have walked out in 32 years. Pictured are staff outside Hammersmith Hospital during the Health Service Strike of 1982

The action comes as the Government faces a series of strikes by public sector workers, following an announcement that civil servants are to stage a walkout next month.  

Members of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union will take industrial action on October 15 in a long-running row over jobs, pay and conditions, while council workers will strike the previous day.

The three days of disruption will be followed by a national protest in London organised by the TUC on October 18 under the slogan, Britain Needs A Pay Rise.

The PCS said that since 2010, taking into account pay cuts, the increase in monthly pension contributions and inflation, many civil servants have suffered a 20 per cent cut in their incomes.

The strike by up to a quarter of a million PCS members will include employees of Westminster government departments and agencies, and the Wales assembly, but not those who work in bodies under the jurisdiction of the Scottish government.

At the Labour Party conference yesterday, the union launched a new report by tax expert Richard Murphy that claimed tax evasion deprives public finances of £80 billion a year.

Collecting a fraction of these 'stolen billions' would change the debate about public spending overnight, the union said.

PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: 'These strikes show we are serious about bringing an end to pay cuts that have slashed the living standards of public servants while the super rich have been rewarded with tax cuts.

'Until we chase down the tax dodgers and invest properly in our communities and public services, the so-called economic recovery will only ever benefit millionaires, while the millions pay the price.'
