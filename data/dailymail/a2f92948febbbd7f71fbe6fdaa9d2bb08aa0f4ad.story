Joan Rivers's personal doctor is 'devastated' and 'unable to sleep' over reports she was involved in the throat surgery that led to the death of the star, it was today claimed.

Dr Gwen Korovin - who was not authorized to be in the operating room at the time - also plans to cooperate with investigators in a bid to clear her name, according to a close source.

The 56-year-old ENT has remained silent following claims she took a selfie with the comedienne before the fatal procedure at Yorkville Endoscopy clinic in Manhattan on August 28.

But today, a source close to her revealed she is determined to prove she has nothing to hide.

Doctor: Dr Gwen Korovin (pictured leaving her office in New York City this week) is 'devastated' and 'unable to sleep' over reports she was involved in the throat surgery that led to the death of the star, it was today claimed

'This has been devastating for Dr Korovin,' the source told Radar. 'Her patients are extended family, not just the celebrities. She has been unable to sleep and has been hounded by the media.

'She will absolutely cooperate with investigators from the New York Health Department and Medical Examiner's Office.' 

Rivers, who rose to fame as a guest on The Tonight Show, died aged 81 after she stopped breathing and went into cardiac arrest during the routine surgery.

She was rushed to nearby Mout Sinai hospital, where she was put on life support, but never regained consciousness. She passed away on September 4.

Earlier this week, Dr Korovin, known as 'throat specialist to the stars', released a statement saying she has 'no comment' to make about the tragic incident.

However, sources close to the medic have accused CNN - who originally published the story of her alleged involvement - of 'making up lies'.

According to TMZ, Dr Korovin has also denied performing a biopsy on Joan. However it is unknown whether she performed any other procedure while reportedly in the room.

In the statement, attorneys from Abrams and Fensterman acting on behalf of Dr Korovin said she is 'respected and admired' in the medical community, but will not be discussing the incident.

It read: 'Gwen S. Korovin M.D. is a highly experienced, board certified otolaryngologist. She maintains priveleges at one of the city's most prestigious hospitals. She is respected and admired by her peers in the medical community and she is revered by her patients.

'As a matter of personal and professional policy, Dr Korovin does not publicly discus her patients or their care and treatment. Further, Dr Korovin is prohibited by state and federal confidentiality laws from discussing her care and treatment of any particular patient.

'For these reasons, neither Dr Korovin nor her attorneys will have any public comment on recent press reports regarding her practice. We ask that the press pleases respect Dr Korovin's personal and professional policy of not discussing her patients as well as the privacy of her patients.'

Dr Korovin, who counts Hugh Jackman, Julie Andrews, Lady Gaga, and Ariana Grande  among her celebrity patients, is an esteemed ear, nose and throat specialist based in Manhattan.

She has even been involved in a documentary with singer Celine Dion.

Rivers's surgery, which was with gastroenterologist Dr Lawrence Cohen, intended to help diagnose her hoarse voice and sore throat, and involved the insertion of a camera down her throat.

Dr Korovin is pictured with comedienne Joy Behar at the Celebrity Dinner Talkfest held at the New York Friars Club in June 2011 

During the operation, an ear, nose and throat specialist - who was not certified by the clinic, as required by law - performed a biopsy on the star's vocal cords.

The medic was described by the source as Joan's personal ENT specialist, who is reported to be Dr Korovin.   

According to CNN, Dr Korovin also allegedly snapped a selfie with Rivers while the star was under anesthesia.
