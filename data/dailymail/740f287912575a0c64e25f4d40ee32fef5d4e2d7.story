I’ve lived and worked on Tyneside and I totally understand the frustrations of Newcastle United fans.

Years ago, by day, I was a poorly paid young football reporter trying to make my way in the industry; by night I was the friendly barman making up my income, chatting about the Toon until the early hours on the Tuxedo Royale, a nightclub on a boat moored under the Tyne Bridge, with a revolving dancefloor and lots of scantily clad barmaids.

I’m beginning to wonder why I ever left!

Newcastle fans were vocal in their calls for manager Alan Pardew to be sacked at Southampton on Saturday

Alan Pardew clung on to his job despite Saturday's 4-0 thrashing but the pressure is growing by the week

Newcastle owner Mike Ashley seemed in high spirits despite the heavy defeat

Micky Quinn was the top dog back then – he used to come in regularly, I even served Gazza and his mates once. If I knew then what I know now I’d have refused for his own good.

But Newcastle United was at the centre of everything for most of the punters in there – win, lose or draw that’s what they wanted to talk about.

The lack of trophies was always a massive problem for Newcastle United fans, but even though that hurt they could still take pride in the goals of Quinn, the trickery of Ginola, the local pride of Shearer, the passion of Keegan.

Right now there is nothing for the St James’ Park faithful to enjoy, and whilst they angrily vent their frustration at manager Alan Pardew, they also want answers from the owner Mike Ashley, answers he never ever looks likely to give.

Newcastle miss players who show pride in the club and the city, like Alan Shearer

The days of brilliant players like David Ginola wearing the black and white seem an age ago

Pardew has shown some glimpses of brilliance in his managerial career – witness the incredible run he took Newcastle on last season – seven wins from nine games in November and December until Yohan Cabaye was sold and not replaced.

But right now Pardew’s stock is lower than a snake’s belly.

Managers come and go but an owner usually sticks around for much longer.

So it’s always puzzled me why Newcastle United fans have never seized the initiative and bought the club.

More than 50,000 go to watch home games regularly, there must be thousands more who don’t go, including many who love Newcastle United but have left the city and even the UK for work or family reasons.

The commitment and passion of Newcastle's fans has never been in doubt - perhaps they should buy the club

There are surely enough fans, some of whom will be incredibly wealthy, who can put together a fans’ trust to launch a credible, effective takeover of this great club, and then they can run it they way the fans want it to be run.

Why hasn’t this happened already? Geordie legends would be queuing up to be part of this, as figureheads or to even put their own money in.

It’s a massive city, with one club in it. The fanbase is huge and more importantly they deserve so much more than they’re getting right now from Newcastle United, and far more than they have received from the club for many years.

I’m at St James’ Park on Saturday for what many think could be Pardew’s final game in charge. It’s a place I love going back to, and a stadium where I spent many working hours cutting my teeth in this industry. It’s special.

So here’s my question for the Toon Army – if you dislike Mike Ashley and Alan Pardew so much, why don’t you buy the club from him and fire the manager yourselves?

At the moment, there is absolutely nothing for them to look forward to

Newcastle fans should seize the moment and buy the club from Mike Ashley

It could prove to be the most straightforward way of removing Pardew
