A devoted mother-of-four who was found murdered in her own living room on Tuesday morning had previously shared her experience with domestic violence in a bid to get others to seek help.

Anthea Mari revealed in an undated newsletter to the Catholic community group, Micah Group, that she had spent 15 years 'in and out of domestic violence refuges, couch-surfing… and even sleeping in her car' while raising her three children.

'Don't think you’re the only one. There are plenty of other women going through it, too,' Ms Mari said.

Only twelve days before her body was found, the 34-year-old also shared a cryptic insight into her current state of mind on her Facebook page.

'I swear this was written about me', the mother-of-three wrote on the social media site before posting an image with the words: 'If she flinches when you go to put your arm around her … Someone else’s hand once wasn’t so sweet.

'Behind every cranky, complicated girl or girl who is scared to love is … a girl who is tired of being broken.'

The mother  was discovered in the lounge room of her house in Norman Park, 4km east of Brisbane, by her two flatmates at around 3.30am.

Ms Mari, right, gave advice to other domestic violence sufferers. 'Don't think you're the only one. There are plenty of other women going through it, too,' Ms Mari said

The 34-year-old's 11 and 12-year-old daughters were also at home at the time and one of them was woken by the assault. They were seen leaving the house in forensic clothes early on Tuesday morning.

On Tuesday evening, police announced they had launched a manhunt for Jacob Michael Smith, 38, who they claim 'may be able to assist with their investigations'.

The public have been warned not to approach Mr Smith.

'If this person is involved in it we are mindful that he could be a danger to [the] public. We just don't know what his involvement is until he comes forward,' Inspector Kemp said.

Mr Smith is reportedly an ex-prison convict who served time for armed robberies, according to News Corp.

'Anyone who may have information about his whereabouts is urged not to approach him but to instead contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or Dutton Park CIB on 3028 8150,' a police statement said.

Another post on Ms Mari's Facebook page on August 15 read: 'A man who hits a woman is not a man'.

Clearly devoted to her family, Ms Mari's Facebook page is filled with images of her children and shared parenting tips.

'The girls are most concerned, they are getting counselling,' Detective Inspector Rod Kemp said.

'It's horrendous. It's their mother. Absolutely horrendous,' he added.

Police believe a man in his thirties, thought to be a friend of Ms Mari, came to the house at around 2am.

Police said no weapon was used and Ms Mari's flatmates, who are giving statements, didn't hear anything.

An autopsy will be conducted on Wednesday to determine the cause of death.

He said police are looking at previous relationships but have 'no idea what sparked it' at the moment.

One of Ms Mari's male flatmates spoke to the man as he was leaving.

'They saw this person leave and then one of the person's has then checked on the deceased,' he said.

'He is known to the person, he has been there before.'

'We don't know if it's a relationship,' he added.

Police are appealing for anyone who saw anything in the street or at the nearby Norman Park railway station to come forward.

They believe the man may have fled from the scene by car or train.

Ms Mari, who rented the home she was found dead at, also has a 15-year-old daughter who lives with her grandmother as well as a three-year-old son.
