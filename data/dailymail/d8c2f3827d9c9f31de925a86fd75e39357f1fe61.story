A violent stalker has been spared jail despite sending his ex-girlfriend texts threatening to kill her, following her home from work and trying to punch her.

Daniel Rowlands, 27, was let off with a community order after Jade Davies, 25, asked the judge to be lenient on her former boyfriend.

Cardiff Crown Court heard that Rowlands sent messages her messages including 'Get yourself a fire extinguisher, it's going to get a little smoky', 'Don’t wear anything flammable' and 'I’m going to kill you, I swear.'

He then crept into her home to look for evidence of her having a new boyfriend, before trying to attack her.

Rowlands, from Caerphilly, South Wales, 
had previously accused her of having a new boyfriend. He sent a message 
asking 'Who's that boy?', and when she denied there was one, replied 
with 'Liar'.

Prosecutor James Evans told Cardiff Crown Court that Rowlands: 'ran into the Miss Davies’s room and started looking through the drawers for evidence of some kind of infidelity.

'He aimed a punch at her but fortunately didn’t make contact. Then he pushed her with both hands to the chest.'

But despite his campaign of intimidation against her, Rowlands was spared prison thanks to Miss Davies.

In light of an 'eloquent' letter Miss Davies sent to him, Judge David Wynn Morgan avoided a prison sentence, saying Rowlands he would benefit more from rehabilitation after his crimes..

Merciful: Miss Davies wrote to the court asking them to be lenient on her former boyfriend

Rowlands admitted burglary, assault by beating and stalking with a fear of violence, for which he was given an 18-month community order and instructions to complete a domestic abuse programme.

Sentencing, Judge David Wynn Morgan told Rowlands: 'Jade Davies has written a very eloquent letter to the court. The fact is you are someone who would benefit more from rehabilitation than from going to prison.'
