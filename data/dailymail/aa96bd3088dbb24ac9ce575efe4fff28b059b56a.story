A man has been stung multiple times while paddle boarding at a popular water activity spot in Rose Bay, in Sydney's east.

The man, believed to be in his 50s, was heard screaming for help after he fell feet first into the ocean and landed directly on a stingray.

At the time of the incident, the man and his son-in-law were the only ones paddle-boarding in the area on Friday morning.

An elderly man has been stung multiple times while paddle boarding at a popular water activity spot in Rose Bay, in Sydney's east

The man, believed to be in his 50s, was heard screaming for help after his foot was stabbed by a stingray

Tommy Woodruff, part owner of Rose Bay Aquatic Hire told Daily Mail Australia that he had hired two paddle-boards at around 11.00am. 

'He happened to fall off the board and fell directly on the stingray, which is really, really unlucky,' Mr Woodruff said. 

'He was in a lot of pain and it took a bit to reassure him.

Steve Irwin 'The Crocodile Hunter', who was famed for his daring stunts with dangerous animals, died in 2006 after he was stabbed by a giant stingray as he made a documentary on the Great Barrier Reef.

The larger-than-life TV personality was 44-years-old when the stingray stabbed him hundreds of times, with one of the blows fatally piercing his heart.

A cameraman who witnessed Irwin's death said he got into the water and approached the huge ray from behind before it lashed out, apparently believing the shadow was a shark. 

Mr Woodruff said stingray injuries occur quite frequently, but this time of the year it is uncommon. 

'If it does happen it is on a low tide - it was mid tide coming in and he was right out on the sand bay.

'If it is low tide we always reassure people and get them to shackle their feet. 

'People need to know they are not going to die from it - I've been through it - it is very common.

'Steve Irwin died from a massive one and it went directly through his heart - we don’t have those big ones down here'

Rose Bay Aquatic Hire had paddle-boarders go back to the sand board, where they spotted the stingray. 

Mr Woodruff said his biggest concern was to prevent the man from going into shock.

'We were straight onto it - we poured hot to boiling water, whatever he could withstand, to submerge the sting. 

'That is all that we could do until paramedics could give him something for the pain.'  

Passer-bys rushed to the man's aid and called triple 000 at around 11.18am on Friday
