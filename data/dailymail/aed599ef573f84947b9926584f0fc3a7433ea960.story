With tears streaming down her face, Britain’s most prolific woman fraudster clearly realised her game was up.

Maria Michaela’s mask of deception slipped when she was confronted by police – and she was still weeping when this mugshot was taken.

The 33-year-old, who used more than a dozen identities to con almost £15million out of high street banks, was jailed today for nine years.

Sobbing: Maria Michaela, crying in her police mugshot, ripped off banks in an elaborate mortgage fraud

Facing prison: Maria Michaela has been convicted of the massive fraud in which she assumed up to a dozen identities. Passport photos show her in various guises used to defraud money out of banks

Posing as an heiress worth £250million, she used fake documents to con her way to a fortune.

She cheated the banks by claiming she was an heiress to the luxury Sun City resort in South Africa worth £250million.

Exclusive: This home in Chelsea's Cheyne Walk is one of several properties Maria Michaela bought in a con totalling £13m

A senior banker at HBOS gave her  four
loans worth £10.5million, and she repeated the con at RBS and was 
given  a further £2.5million.

She used the money to buy luxury homes
in some of the most expensive districts of London, including a 
£3.5million home in Chelsea and a mews property in Belgravia, close to 
Buckingham Palace.

The banks which lent her the money 
thought they were going to get it back when Michaela sold on the 
properties at a profit. However, the bankers were unaware that she had 
bribed chartered surveyor Mary-Jane Rathie, a policeman’s wife, to write
fictitious reports in which she doubled the real value of the 
properties.

This meant that Michaela, who is from Mauritius, received loans which were far higher than the cost of the houses she bought.

Michaela gave Rathie, 44, £910,000 in 
cash, a £143,000 Bentley Continental and a £49,000 Range Rover Sport as a
reward for her part in the scam. Michaela then defaulted on her 
mortgage payments and disappeared for three years.

Police finally caught her in January 
and discovered thousands of stolen identity documents which she had been
using to submit fake mortgage applications.

Today Detective Inspector Andy 
Fife, of City of London Police, said: ‘We think she is the biggest 
female fraudster. We have not had any female on this scale before.’

Police suspect the true scale of Michaela’s fraud during her 11 years in the UK may be far higher than is currently known.

Jailing her at Harrow Crown Court, 
Judge Graham Aering said: ‘You were a very experienced, highly skilled, 
and exceptionally well-equipped fraudster.

‘These frauds were carefully and 
professionally planned.

Scam: The con-artist had at least a dozen identities, pictured left as Bruna Louise, and right as she really looks

'They involved the hijacking of other people’s 
identities and extensive use of fraudulently-created  identity 
documents.’

Michaela admitted two counts of fraud, three counts of 
conspiracy to defraud and two charges of conspiracy to money-launder at a
previous hearing.

She appeared in the dock alongside accomplices Guy Steel, Stephen Hunter-Scott  and Saba Humadi.

Hunter-Scott, 53, of Fulham, West 
London, admitted three counts of conspiracy to defraud, two counts of 
conspiracy to money launder, and possession of false identity documents. He was jailed for five years.

Humadi, 56, of Battersea, South London, was given a 12-month  sentence suspended for two years for money laundering.

Steel, 51, of Knightsbridge, Central London, was jailed for four years for money laundering and attempted robbery. Rathie, from Finchley, North London, was jailed for six years last year.

Accomplice: Mary-Jane Rathie outside the Old Bailey, accepted more than £1m in gifts after she gave inflated valuations for homes in London's most exclusive neighbourhoods
