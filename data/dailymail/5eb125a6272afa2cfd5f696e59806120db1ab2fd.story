Begging for forgiveness: Gary Oldman has issued a grovelling apology over his controversial new Playboy interview

Gary Oldman has made a grovelling apology after saying Hollywood is a 'town run by Jews' in his now infamous Playboy interview.

The Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes star made the comments as he claimed Mel Gibson was being unfairly ostracised over his anti-Semitic rants, while also complaining that political correctness 'is c**p.'

And after he was attacked over his choice of words by the Anti-Defamation League, he issued his fawning apology, in which he hailed Jews as 'the chosen people.'

In a statement addressing the 'gentlemen' of the organisation, which was printed on Deadline, he wrote: 'I am deeply remorseful that comments I recently made in the Playboy Interview were offensive to many Jewish people.

'Upon reading my comments in print - I see how insensitive they may be, and how they may indeed contribute to the furtherance of a false stereotype.

'Anything that contributes to this stereotype is unacceptable, including my own words on the matter.'

The 56-year-old Dark Knight Rises star went further as he tried to distance himself from his statements in the forthcoming edition of the pornography magazine, insisting he is a huge admirer of the contribution Jewish people have made to showbusiness.

He said: 'If, during the interview, I had been asked to elaborate on this point I would have pointed out that I had just finished reading Neal Gabler’s superb book about the Jews and Hollywood, An Empire of Their Own: How the Jews invented Hollywood.

'The fact is that our business, and my own career specifically, owes an enormous debt to that contribution.

'I hope you will know that this apology is heartfelt, genuine, and that I
 have an enormous personal affinity for the Jewish people in general, 
and those specifically in my life.'

He then finished by begging for forgiveness, going as far as to say he is unworthy of using a Hebrew greeting meaning 'peace be upon you.'

The working class actor, who is the son of a welder, said: ''The Jewish People, persecuted thorough the ages, are the first to hear God’s voice, and surely are the chosen people.

Oldman's controversial interview has derailed his tour promoting Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes

'I would like to sign off with “Shalom Aleichem”—but under the circumstances, perhaps today I lose the right to use that phrase, so I will wish you all peace.'

Gary, who is in the middle of promoting his forthcoming Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes film, caused outrage after claiming Mel Gibson is 'all right,' despite the actor's previous use of anti-Semitic and racist epithets.

He also claimed the current vogue of political correctness was rife with hypocrisy.

The Dracula star insisted: 'Mel Gibson is in a town that’s run by Jews and he said the wrong thing because he’s actually bitten the hand that I guess has fed him - and doesn’t need to feed him anymore because he’s got enough dough.

'He’s like an outcast, a leper, you know?

''But some 
Jewish guy in his office somewhere hasn’t turned and said, “That f***ing
 kraut” or “F*** those Germans,” whatever it is? We all hide and try to 
be so politically correct. That's what gets me.'

Gibson,
 58, made anti-Jewish slurs when he was arrested for suspected 
drink-driving in Malibu in 2006, two years after his film The Passion Of
 The Christ was criticised for depicting Jews negatively.

His words prompted an angry backlash, with antisemitism group the Anti-Defamation League's national director Abraham H. Foxman saying: 'He should know better than to repeat and give credence to tired anti-Semitic tropes.

'Mel Gibson’s ostracization in Hollywood was not a matter of being "politically incorrect," as Mr. Oldman suggests, but of paying the consequences for outing himself as a bigot and a hater.

'It is disturbing that Mr. Oldman appears to have bought into Mr. Gibson’s warped and prejudiced world view.'

He also added the assertion Jews control Hollywood is, 'an anti-Semitic stereotype based on the "Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion," the 19th Century anti-Semitic forgery that suggested Jews conspire to control major industries such as banking and finance.'

The apology is the latest piece of backpeddling from the English star's camp, with his manager Douglas Urbanski earlier saying: 'This notion that he's defending Mel and Alec is preposterous. Gary Oldman would not defend hate speech or any divisive speech. The piece lacked a kind of balance on that regard.'
