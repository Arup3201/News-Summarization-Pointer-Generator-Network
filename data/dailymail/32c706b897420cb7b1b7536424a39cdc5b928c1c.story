A mentally disabled man was allegedly chained up in a basement by a convicted killer who stole his benefit cheques, the first victim testimony in the Philadelphia 'House of Horrors' case has revealed.

Edwin Sanabria, 31, was one of four adults found locked in the squalid basement in October. Police said he and his fellow victims had the mental capacity of 10-year-olds. He bore scars on his back and chest.

Linda Ann Weston, 51, is accused of being the ringleader of a gang that, over 10 years, kept as many as 50 adults and children in the same kind of conditions in order to 'steal' their government benefit cheques.

Emaciated victims: (L-R) Tamara Breeden, Derwin McLemire and Herbert Knowles gave a TV interview after being rescued from the basement

Horror chamber: The dark and filthy basement where four disabled people were kept chained to pipes

Stairs to basement: Weston's daughter Jean McIntosh, 32, lived in a property above the boiler room where the victims were found

Weston's daughter Jean McIntosh, 32, 
boyfriend Gregory Thomas, 47, and friend Eddie 'the Reverend Ed' Wright,
50, have also been charged in the case.

There were gasps as hospital 
photographs of Mr Sanabria's injuries were shown in court, along with 
images of the injuries to his girlfriend Tamara Breeden, and their 
fellow victims Drwin McLemire and Herbert Knowles.  The victims have the mental capacity of 10-year-olds, authorities have said.

Emaciated Breeden's hip bone was 
protruding through her skin, she had a badly damaged ear and dozens of 
welts, bruises and lacerations on her scalp, legs, arms and back.  

Drwin McLemire had several open, 
infected wounds on his legs. Knowles, who was found chained to a boiler,
had a lump on his forehead.

Weston is accused of running the 
benefit-fraud scheme in several states from 2002 until her arrest in 
October, after a landlord stumbled on the captives.

Mr Sanabria testified that Weston 
took him to a government office in 2001 to sign paperwork and that he 
never again saw his monthly $674 cheques, or his food stamp card.

Prosecutors suspect Weston had 
perhaps dozens of adult and child victims, including her 19-year-old 
niece. She was in possession of more than 50 Social Security cards, 
power of attorney documents and similar forms when she was arrested.

At the preliminary hearing, Mr 
Sanabria testified that the victims had been kept in the Philadelphia 
basement for 10 days, using a bucket for a bathroom and being fed just 
once or twice a day. Weston's daughter had an apartment upstairs.

Police officer John Murphy testified 
that when he entered the basement, 'The stench in the room and on their 
person was unbearable.'

Asked to describe the smell further, he said, 'Basically, death.'

Mr Sanabria said that he, along with 
the other victims, moved with Weston's gang between Philadelphia and 
Texas, Florida and Virginia over the past decade.

However, Weston's lawyer told the court that the group - the victims and the accused - were 'a family'.

Vile: Makeshift beds and dirty blankets filled the sub-basement which was home to four vulnerable individuals

Makeshift prison cell: Authorities fear as many as 50 victims - adults and children - have been kept in the same kinds of conditions over the last decade

Under questioning from Weston's 
lawyer, Mr Sanabria conceded that he was never forced to move with them 
or give her control of his finances.

'Everybody moved as if you were a family, right?' said Weston's lawyer, George S. Yacoubian Jr.

'Right,' said Mr Sanabria.

'At any point during the last 10 years when you were living with Linda, did you ever scream for help?' asked Mr Yacoubian Jr.

'No,' Mr Sanabria replied.

But Mr Sanabria also said he was not 
allowed to go outside without permission and was typically kept in a 
locked basement, attic or wardrobe.

Mr Sanabria testified that Weston, 
Thomas and, less often, Wright beat some of the victims with bare hands 
or weapons that included bats, chains and extension cords.

Mr Sanabria said that he, too, had frequently beat Breeden and McLemire when Weston told him to.

Mr Sanabria, who also testified he 
was once kept in a wardrobe that was nailed shut by Weston, is now 
recovering well, according to his brother.

In the last few days prosecutors 
added a list of new charges to the case with counts against Weston 
including promoting prostitution and custody interference.

The existing charges include kidnapping, 
aggravated assault, custodial interference, theft by deception and 
neglect of a care-dependent person.

The suspects, all from Philadelphia, remain in custody. They haven't yet entered pleas.

Weston is a convicted killer. She was jailed for the 1981 killing of Bernardo Ramos, 25, who she locked in a wardrobe and fed just twice in two months.
