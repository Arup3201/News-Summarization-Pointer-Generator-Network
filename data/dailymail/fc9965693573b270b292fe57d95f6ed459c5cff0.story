The heartbroken parents of the three friends stabbed to death by virgin killer Elliot Rodger have spoken of their devastation at the loss of their sons.

The parents of Weihan 'David' Wang said that their 20-year-old son had been planning to move out of the Isla Vista home he shared with Rodger because he was anti-social and played loud music in the middle of the night.

His tearful mother Jinshuang 'Jane' Liu said her only son was supposed to come home to Fremont, California for the summer, go on a family vacation to Yellowstone National Park and celebrate his 21st birthday in July.

His father, Charly Wang, could only stand in the doorway of their home, hugging his wife and uttering deep, guttural cries.

Last Friday, Rodger, the son of Hunger Games assistant director Peter Rodger, murdered six people before shooting himself dead.

Mr Wang, 20, of Fremont, and Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, of San Jose, were both stabbed to death by Rodger on Friday at the apartment they had shared with him.

Investigators are looking into whether he killed the pair in their sleep.

The body of another UCSB student, George Chen, 19, of San Jose, was also found at the apartment, but he did not live there.

Rodger then climbed into his SUV and 
drove towards the Alpha Phi sorority house, where he shot dead Katherine
 Cooper, 22, and Veronika Weiss, 19.

He
 then got back into his car and drove to a nearby deli, where he opened 
fire. There, he killed student Chris Michael-Martinez, 20, in an attack 
that was captured on surveillance footage.

Wang,
 20, and his parents immigrated to the country from China ten years ago.
 He graduated from Fremont Christian School and was studying computer 
engineering at UC Santa Barbara.

Liu called her son 'the joy of the family,' someone who aced his SATs and never bragged about it.

'I wish I could go in exchange of my son's life,' she said. 'I'm just heartbroken. You can't imagine for a mom.'

George Chen's parents visited a 
makeshift memorial set up for their son, Hong and Wang in Isla Vista on 
Monday night and added their names in chalk to the sidewalk.

They told KABC-TV the country needed tougher gun laws to avert another mass killing.

'We
 would die a hundred times, a thousand times, but we don't want our kids
 to get hurt,' Chen's mother, Kelly Wang, said as she fought through 
tears.

'This shouldn't happen to any family. This should be the last one in the United States.'

His father Johnny Chen told the 
station that when they heard the news, they initially didn't think their
 son was hurt because he did not live in the building and they knew 
nothing about Rodger.Â 

A family friend said Chen, 19, was a gentle soul who had a fondness for working with children.

'He was a very good kid, very smart,' Sherry Shih told the San Francisco Chronicle on Monday.

'This is just a terrible, and (his parents) cannot understand at all how something like this could happen,' Shih said.

Johnny Chen, the father of George Chen, spoke about how no family should deal with such the tragic loss of a child when they visited a memorial in Isla Vista on Monday night

Chen, who was also studying computer science, graduated from Leland High School in San Jose and was originally from Ottawa, Ontario.

Cheng Yuan Hong, 20, who went by the name James, grew up in Taipei and was pursuing a degree in computer science, according to his Facebook page.

Friends said he was a hard-working and bright student who was always willing to help others.

'I wish I could go in exchange of my son's life. I'm just heartbroken. You can't imagine for a mom.'

'He would always smile at everyone he knows,' said Han Chou, who knew the victim at UC Santa Barbara.

He graduated from Lynbrook High School in San Jose. His drama teacher remembered him as a quiet student who was happy to work backstage to ensure that his classmates could shine.

'James was shy, quiet, gentle, sweet, kind and most respectful,' Laurel Cohen told the San Jose Mercury News on Monday.

'Not someone who easily could engage in conversation. But I remember his earnest nature, conviction, honesty and mostly his smile; it lit up a room.'

In January, Rodger accused Hong of stealing three candles, valued at $22, said Joyce Dudley, Santa Barbara County district attorney.

When Mr Hong said he didn't know where the candles were, Rodger performed a citizen's arrest and called 911. Sheriff's deputies found the candles on Hong's bed. He was arrested and charged with a petty theft infraction.

The strange incident was one of three contacts authorities had with Rodger before he went on the deadly rampage.
