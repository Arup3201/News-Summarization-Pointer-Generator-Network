West Brom head coach Alan Irvine insists he is ready to make the big decisions after axing Swedish defender Jonas Olsson from his starting line-up.

The Baggies chief warned he is prepared to drop any under-performing players ahead of Wednesday's Capital One Cup clash with Hull.

Olsson's errors had cost goals against Swansea and Everton, and he was replaced by Joleon Lescott in Sunday's 1-0 Barclays Premier League win at Tottenham.

Irvine has a fully-fit squad available after previously struggling with injuries and can now shape his team.

'It wasn't easy telling Jonas what I intended to do,' he told the club's official site.

'I have huge respect for him. He is a top professional and a very, very good player, but he has made a couple of uncharacteristic mistakes which have proved costly in the last couple of games.

'I have a full range of choices for the first time and I had to look a couple of people in the eye and tell them they were not playing. It is never pleasant but it is part of the job.

'And you can be absolutely certain that Jonas will remain a very important member of the squad.'

Olsson could be recalled for the visit of the Tigers, with Irvine considering changes.

Silvestre Varela could also be involved after he scored in the Baggies' Under-21 win over Brighton on Monday.

The Porto loanee is yet to make his debut as he has not been match fit and fellow new boys Georgios Samaras and Sebastian Blanco are also on stand-by.

Lescott, who signed in June after leaving Manchester City, is likely to be rested after almost two months recovering from a knee injury before making his debut on Sunday.

And Irvine said he was not prepared to rush him into action despite the Baggies' winless league start to the season, before James Morrison struck at White Hart Lane.

'We would have been taking a big risk with Joleon had we put him in before he was ready and I hope the fans understand that,' he said.

'I keep trying to explain that we want to put people in the team but they have to be ready.

'We already had a setback with him in the pre-season friendly at Forest but we felt he was ready this week.

'There were no niggles or aches after his work, everything was good and it was also the right opportunity to put him in.'
