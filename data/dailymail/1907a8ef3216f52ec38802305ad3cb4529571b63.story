A woman in Russia has sparked outrage after burying her dog in a human graveyard, with locals describing it as ‘sick’ and ‘an affront to the Christian faith’.

She could now face jail on blasphemy charges after prosecutors were alerted.

Ludmilla Yelsukova's burial ceremony for her pet Yorkshire Terrier happened three years ago in the village of Chesnokovka, in Bashkortostan, a federal subject in south-western Russia.

But it was only recently that other people whose relatives were buried there found out that the well-tended tomb was for a dog.

They said it was blatant ‘paganism’ and an affront to religion, and demanded it be moved.

‘This is the revival of the ancient religions of animal worship and is not only sick but a massive insult to the Christian faith,’ said Maria Papova, one of the local residents.

But the tearful 47-year-old woman has so far refused, saying the plot was paid for and she still needed a place to mourn.

She said: ‘I have had no-one else in my life since, and no-one ever treated me as well as Ursu.’

Vyacheslav Archangelskyy, 61, rector of the village's Cathedral of the Ascension, agreed however with the angry residents and has now ordered an investigation as to whether the local priest who was in charge of the church graveyard knew what was going on.

Meanwhile a report has also been sent to prosecutors who are probing whether she has broken any laws.
