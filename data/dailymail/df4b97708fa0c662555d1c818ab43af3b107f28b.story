On stage, Michael Davenport plays Bernard - a lady loving Lothario with three fiancees from multiple countries - in a far-off-Broadway adaptation the 1960 French play Boeing Boeing.

But on Friday, Davenport ditched his on-stage persona as a three-timing ladies man to propose to his longtime girlfriend - and he did it on stage in front of a live audience.

At the conclusion of Friday's performance of Boeing Boeing at the Des Moines Community Playhouse in Des Moines, Iowa, the play's director announced to the audience that he would like audience member Renee Schwarz to join the cast on the stage because the play's star, Davenport, had something to ask her.

'Line?': Michael Davenport pretended to forget his line when he proposed on stage following a performance of Boeing Boeing

Schwarz, of course, is Davenport's girlfriend.

Davenport appeared shocked by the announcement, but directed his leading lady through a door on the right side of the stage.

Then, one of his co-stars handed him a tiny box - at which point, the jig was up.

As soon as she sees the box, Schwarz covers her mouth - apparently aware of what was coming. And then Davenport began to ask her his question, as seen in a video posted on the Des Moines Register's website.

Yes: Davenport's girlfriend, Renee Schwarz, said yes after he proposed to her following a performance of Boeing Boeing

'You know I love you very much...line?' he joked, before running over to the director who pretends to whisper the line into his ear.

The thespian then marched back over to his girlfriend, dropped to one knee and asked 'will you marry me?'

As expected, she said yes - and the crowd roared in approval before giving the newly engaged couple a standing ovation.
