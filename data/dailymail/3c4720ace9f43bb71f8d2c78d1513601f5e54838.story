A Navy SEAL and his service dog were the unexpected stars of an NFL game this weekend when the pair rappelled from the scoreboard onto the pitch before a Dallas Cowboys game.

Dangling from above, the serviceman and his canine companion dropped from the roof of the AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, on Sunday using a rope before the home side faced down the Arizona Cardinals.

The unidentified soldier and his dog were delivering the official game coin to the team captains ahead to toss ahead of the game, which the Cardinals won 28-17. Other military personnel were also involved in the game's halftime show.

Their performance was part of a 'salute to service' drive by the NFL, which will see patriotic displays at 32 games, and a donation of $100 per point scored by each team during the program.
