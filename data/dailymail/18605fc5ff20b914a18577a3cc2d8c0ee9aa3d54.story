Red meat allergies caused by a single, tiny species of tick are becoming increasingly common in a well-known enclave of some of the wealthiest people in America.

Tucked away at the tip of Long Island, New York, the Hamptons have long been a refuge for the rich from the sweltering New York City summer.

And it may also increasingly be a haven for the Lone Star tick, a small critter that causes a big problem. That is, if  you’re a meat eater.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO...

Odd reaction: The increasingly common lone star tick, named for the spot on the female's back, appears to inject a substance when it bites that causes victims to become allergic to red meat, sometimes violently

‘It's a huge problem out here,’ says Erin McGintee, an allergist in East Hampton, N.Y. told WSJ.com. ‘I've been trying to get the word out.’

There may be a lot fewer filet minons hitting the grill this summer. Symptoms of the strange illness range from mild, like abdominal cramps, to severe, like anaphylaxis and even death.

Hives, difficulty breathing, and vomiting are also possible.

And they all stem from eating red meat. Though researchers say the symptoms, unlike those from typical food allergies, may take hours to take hold.

Burger time? Residents of the Hamptons, New York's summer playground for the rich, are increasingly being bitten by ticks that cause severe reactions to red meat in some people

Little bugger: The head of a lone star tick. Researchers think the bug's bite can inject a sugar called alpha-gal that causes future encounters with the substance, also found in red meat, to trigger an allergic response

Six years ago, Tony Piazza of Southampton, New York says he began waking up unable to breath in the middle of the night, covered in hives. It happened every few months for years and doctors could only say it was some sort of allergy and administer antihistamines.

But then Piazza, 49, noticed the symptoms only occurred when he ate meat. First it was lamb, then steak, then burgers.

‘I swore off red meat completely, and the reactions stopped,’ he said.

Researchers believe the tick passes on a kind of carbohydrate called alpha-gal that is present in meat. It is believed that, after a tick encounter, some people’s immune systems begin to treat alpha-gal as an allergen. Hence, the often serious reactions.

And the problem may be becoming more widespread. The lone star tick—which is not named for the state of Texas, but for the single white spot on the backs of females—was once confined to the ‘tick belt’ of the Southeastern U.S., but has increasingly been found further into Western and Northern states.

Along with the tick, the cases seem to be spreading. Hence, the sudden increase of cases in the Hamptons.

Worse and worse: And the problem is spreading. Once confined to the Southeastern U.S. 'tick belt,' the lone star tick is now found further west and north, such as in the wealthy Long Island enclave

McGintee said she currently knows of around 70 cases and sees more every week.

Unfortunately, there continues to be scepticism  regarding the what exactly causes the reactions.

Most allergic reactions are immediate, which means people aren’t always able to identify the cause of their symptoms, much less trace them back to a tick bite that could have occurred been months prior.

Confusion: Reactions and triggers vary, making diagnosis difficult. Unlike other food allergies, the meat reaction occurs hours after consumption. And the allergy itself may not begin until long after contact with the tiny tick

The good news: Thankfully, contacts with the vegetarianism-inducing tick can be avoided and scientists think the allergy may fade after years of avoiding subsequent bites

Adding to the confusion is the range 
of triggers for the allergy. Some people react more seriously to some 
meats than others and some people’s reactions can even be triggered by 
something as simple as the gelatin in gelcap vitamins or marshmallows.

And even with people like McGintee sounding the alarm, she says ‘There are still a lot of people who don't believe it.’

Despite
the questions and lingering confusion, there is some good news. The 
allergy, researchers are finding, seems to fade after years have passed 
since the initial trigger so long as recurring tick bites are avoided 
and no deaths have thus far been reported.

Doctors don't know how long the allergy could last, but its increasingly common and becoming more widespread in the United States
