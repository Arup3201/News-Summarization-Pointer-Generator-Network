Tie the knot: Adele Vellacott and Dave Cobain became the first Take Me Out couple to get married on Saturday

Adele Vellacott and Dave Cobain have become the first Take Me Out couple to get married.

The couple, who live in London, met on the hit dating show but ended up going on dates to the show's fictional date destination - the Isle of Fernando's - with other people.

Two years later they have a one year old baby, and on Saturday tied the knot in an intimate ceremony at Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel in Monmouthshire, South Wales.

Adele, 34, and Dave, 30, appeared on the second series of the ITV show in 2012.

Each 
episode sees single men trying to impress 30 single girls, eventually 
selecting their favourites from those who still have their lights left 
on.

But it wasn't love at first sight as Dave picked Lucy Evans - and Adele ended up going out with someone else.

When they were in Fernando's, however, they didn't end up hitting it off with their respective dates, and love slowly blossomed.

Adele confesses to MailOnline that pined after Dave for months, but he kept spurning her advances.

'It was between me and another girl at the end, we were both from Wales, and he ended up on the date with the other girl. We all got flown over to Fernando's but our dates didn't work out, and Dave and I ended up building up a great friendship.

'He's lovely. Something about him pulled me towards him.

'In
 the months that followed we ended up meeting at parties and reunions...
 he made me chase him for quite a while, playing hard to get. I really 
liked him, he's a cheeky chappy.

'I liked 
him from the start but didn't realise they were these strong 
relationship feelings. I thought I wasn't his cup of tea because he kept
 blowing me out when I'd ask him out on a date.

'I hadn't been in a serious relationship
 for five years before I got with Dave. I lost my confidence a lot... so
 for me to start chasing somebody. I couldn't carry on.

Didn't work out: The decision was between Adele and another girl at the end, and he ended up on the date with the other girl. 'We all got flown over to Fernando's but our dates didn't work out, and Dave and I ended up building up a great friendship,' she said

'Eventually I thought, I cant keep asking him out. I just told him outright that I had feelings for him...

'He had no idea. He actually said he thought I was out of his league.'

Soon after, the couple got together, and by June 2013 they had their beautiful boy, Freddie, Take Me Out's first baby.

He was even page boy at the big day yesterday and 'stole the show'.

Just 100 close family, friends and fellow 足contestants were in attendance, including Take Me Out's Natalie Booth, a red-haired burlesque performer, and blonde, tattooed Kate McGann.

But the show's presenter Paddy 足McGuinness, 40, was absent.

'I met 
Paddy again a while back when I did a pilot for another show. He joked 
about being invited to the wedding but we didn't think he'd want to come
 all the way to Wales.

'We keep in touch with some of the production team and they tell us he often asks how we are,' Adele tells the Star.

'We love telling people how we met. It's
 such a lovely story. People say to Dave "I bet you never live it down 
that you turned her light off".

Sealed with a kiss: The couple are setting sail on a cruise around the Canary Islands, including Tenerife - the real home to the fictional Isle of 足Fernando's where Take Me Out couples have their first dates

Cupid? Adele said: 'I met Paddy again a while back when I did a pilot for another show. He joked about being invited to the wedding but we didn't think he'd want to come all the way to Wales'

In a week's time the newlyweds are off on honeymoon to - where else - the Isle of Fernando's.

They will take a cruise around
 the Canary Islands, including Tenerife - the real home to the fictional

The Welsh presenter for Psychic TV, who has lived in London for ten years, has now relocated back to Wales with her new family.
