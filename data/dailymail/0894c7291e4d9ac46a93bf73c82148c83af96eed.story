Domain names linked to the tragic events at the Boston Marathon are being bought up to keep them out of the hands of 'conspiracy kooks'.

Visitors to bostonmarathonconspiracy.com will find only a message asking them to 'keep the victims... in your thoughts', after a man purchased the web address to prevent it becoming a forum for rampant speculation over who was responsible for the bombings.

Jaimie Muehlhausen's 'impulsive action' has inspired others to buy up similar addresses in the same way, after conspiracy theorists suggested U.S. government forces could have been behind the atrocity.

'Keep the victims in your thoughts': Jaimie Muehlhausen said he bought the domain name out of respect for those affected by the 'horrible tragedy'

'Buying the domain name was an impulsive action in anticipation of the inevitable reaction from a certain group of people, nothing more,' Mr Muehlhausen, from California, told the New York Daily News.

He added that he did not do it for media
attention, but rather 'out of respect for the victims and the families 
of those affected by this horrible tragedy'.

Mr Muehlhausen cited the '9/11 conspiracy nuts' and the 'heartless and sick Sandy Hook conspiracy theorists' in an e-mail to Slate.com.

The message that appears on the homepage initially read: 'I bought this domain to keep some conspiracy theory kook from owning it. Please keep the victims of this event and their families in your thoughts. Thank you.'

The first line of the text has since been removed.

Similar messages now appear on bostonmarathonconspiracies.com and bostonconspiracies.com after people inspired by Mr Muehlhausen bought the domain names.

Conspiracy theorists began speculating about the Boston Marathon bombings just hours after the blasts brought carnage to the city on Monday.

In the first press conference after the explosions that left three dead and scores more injured, a conservative blogger asked whether it was a 'false flag staged attack'.

The term false flag refers to instances where covert government forces set up violent incidents in order to scare citizens into handing over control to federal authorities.

Dan Bidondi of right-wing site InfoWars posited the loaded question, implying that the bombing was designed to increase federal authority.

'Why were the loud speakers telling people in the audience to be calm moments before the bombs went off? Is this another false flag staged attack to take our civil liberties and promote homeland security while sticking their hands down our pants on the streets?' Mr Bidondi said.

His suggestion was flatly dismissed by Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick.

Meanwhile right-wing radio host Alex Jones tweeted: 'Our hearts go out to those that are hurt or killed #Boston marathon - but this thing stinks to high heaven #falseflag'.

A massive investigation is ongoing in Boston as detectives trawl a 12-block crime scene in the city following the blasts on Monday afternoon.

The two explosions, which erupted close to the finish line of the Boston Marathon shortly before 3pm, claimed the lives of eight-year-old Martin Richard, restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, and Chinese student LÃ¼ Lingzi, 23.

The latest figures emerging after the attack indicates that the number of people injured stands at 183.
