Television producer Shonda Rhimes hit out at an article posted on Deadline which claimed television has become too diverse this season and the 'trend' may not last.

The article, by  Nellie Andreeva, published Tuesday is titled 'The Year Of Ethnic Castings – About Time Or Too Much Of Good Thing?' Andreeva wrote that though ethnic diversity in television is long overdue, 'the pendulum might have swung a bit too far in the opposite direction.'

The article quickly drew a wave of criticism on Twitter with Rhimes, 45, leading the charge.

She tweeted: '1st Reaction:: HELL NO. Lemme take off my earrings, somebody hold my purse! 2nd Reaction: Article is so ignorant I can't even be bothered.'

Tweet: Shonda Rhimes led the backlash Tuesday night with this tweet after Deadline posted an article calling minorities 'hot commodities' and saying casting ethnic actors may be 'too much of a good thing'

Andreeva noted that though African-Americans are the most 'loyal' television viewers, the group only accounts for 13 percent of the U.S. population. She went on to say that 'grossly underserved' African-American actors are being compensated, but said the growth in ethnic roles may have 'reached its peak.' 

Additionally, she noted that other 'hot commodities' are contributing to the trend, including 'occasional foreigners with that 'sparkle.''  

Just hours after the article was posted Tuesday evening, many Twitter users blasted the article causing Deadline to trend for hours, The Wrap reports.

Rhimes, creator of 'Grey's Anatomy,' 'Scandal,' and 'How to Get Away With Murder,' retweeted a few critical tweets about the article from the New York Times' Emily Nussbaum, Dave Itzkoff, and the Huffington Post's Mo Ryan

Many celebrities, television industry journalists, and Twitter users criticized the article and even created the hashtag #DeadlineHeadlines with offensive headlines they believe the publication would use.

Retweeters of Rhimes' post include actress Garcelle Beauvais, Helena Andrews, author and Washington Post journalist, Ava Duvernay, the director of 'Selma,' and more than 1,000 others.
