A taxi driver who knocked down and killed a father-of-two before dragging his body 90ft along the road has walked free from court.

Mohammed Irfan, 42, was chatting to a female passenger in the back of his cab when he mowed down Shaun Hodgkinson on October 27 last year. 

Despite feeling the car go over the 26-year-old, Irfan continued driving along the road in Sandyford, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, before finally stopping and discovering his lifeless body wedged under the car.

However, despite pleading guilty to one count of causing death by careless driving at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court yesterday, Irfan walked free from court. 

Sentencing him to 24-weeks, suspended for two years, Recorder Christopher Goodchild said: 'You caused the death of a person by reason of careless driving by a lapse of concentration.

'This was not a case of a man driving at high speed, or under the influence of alcohol, or without the lights on.

'What it was, was an ordinary working man like you momentarily lapsing. But that lapse killed a man.

'I must take account that he should not have been where he was and he bears that responsibility.'

The court heard how Irfan had been twisting around in the seat of his Toyota Avensis to chat to a female passenger and did not see Mr Hodgkinson lying in the road after he struck him at around 4am.

Prosecutor David Bennett said: 'There was a conversation between the defendant and the rear passenger.

'At times she leant into the gap between the seating. She described him as twisting in his seat to speak to her over his left shoulder.

'Immediately after the roundabout near KFC she noticed something and realised it was a person lying motionless in the road.

The incident occurred in Sandyford, Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire (above) at about 4am and Mr Hodgkinson died at the scene after suffering a fractured skull, ruptured heart, punctured lungs and a ruptured liver

'She assumed the defendant would stop but he carried on, running over Mr Hodgkinson. The taxi shuddered.

'He brought his taxi to a stop. He got out and had a look but got back in and said he could not see anything.

'She suggested he looked under the vehicle. He did and saw someone trapped under his car.'

Mr Hodgkinson suffered a fractured skull, ruptured heart, punctured lungs and ruptured liver. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Ahmed Nadim, defending, said the incident was a 'catastrophic tragedy'.

He said: 'It was a momentary lapse. If his liberty must be denied it can be denied in the context of a curfew.'

Irfan, of Codbridge Stoke-on-Trent, was made the subject of a five month curfew and banned from driving for two years and until he passes an extended test. He was also ordered to pay £300 costs.

He refused to comment outside court yesterday.
