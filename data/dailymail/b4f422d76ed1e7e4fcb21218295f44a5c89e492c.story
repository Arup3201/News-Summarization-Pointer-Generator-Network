A young father gunned down on his doorstep has been named by murder squad detectives today.

Sebastian Jamal Hyman-Knight, 21, was found with a gunshot wound in Battersea, south-west London, on Thursday night.

He was taken to hospital, but died in the early hours of yesterday.

Today, Scotland Yard confirmed Mr Hyman-Knight's identity and released a photograph of him.

Police also revealed a 30-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and taken to a south London police station.

Detectives from the Homicide and Major Crime Command are investigating the shooting and say they 'retain an open mind as to any motive'.

Police were called at around 11.30pm on Thursday to reports of a shot fired in Tennyson Street.

Officers attended and found Mr Hyman-Knight in the street.

A post-mortem examination will be carried out today. His family have been informed, police said. 

Yesterday, neighbours say they witnessed the young father being being beaten up in the street before he was killed. 

Officers were called to the scene on Tennyson Street, in Battersea, at around 11:30pm where they found the victim lying in a pool of blood outside his house.

Mr Hyman-Knight, who is believed to be the father of an 18-month-old daughter, was taken to a nearby hospital for surgery but died shortly after 1am.

Forensic teams arrived on the scene at around 9am on Friday and cordoned off the whole road while they looked for clues.

Yesterday, two family members visited the scene and described Mr Hyman-Knight as a 'lovely man', according to the Evening Standard.

Neighbour Zoe Kaye-Bradley said: 'There was a massive row outside the house and screaming it was really vicious. We are in total shock over this.'

One female resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'I heard an argument late (on Thursday night) and it was definitely heated.

'I think it was further up the road from me but I'm not sure. I just closed my blinds and turned up the TV. But then a while later, I'm not sure how long, I heard a loud bang and it must of been the gunshot. It's shocking really.

'My neighbour told me she could see lots of police outside and paramedics were giving CPR to a man for quite a while.' 

Banker Alex Ultahan, 24, who lives on the street added: 'I heard a bang and it sounded like a gunshot but you just don't think it's going to happen in a nice street like this.'  

Family members visiting the house where he was shot described him as a 'lovely man' while neighbours said he enjoyed bodybuilding and kept himself to himself

Rosemary Watkins, 50, lives on Montefiore Street, which runs parallel to Tennyson St with a small playpark running between part of the roads.

She said: 'I was on my sofa (on Thursday night) when I heard a gunshot. It was loud enough to get me off my sofa and unfortunately I know what a gunshot sounds like because I used to live in Stockwell.

'I looked out my blind but I couldn't see anything because the park was in total darkness. But when I did see police later they cordoned off the park straight away.'

According to residents, the victim had lived at the address for between six months and a year.

Another man who lives down the street, who asked not to be named, said: 'I was watching a movie, so I had the television on pretty loud. But I heard a bang, something that sounded like a car back firing.

'But then a while later I saw the police lights going down the street, and I thought s**t, it must have been a gun shot.

'It is worrying, and I didn’t want to get involved so I stayed inside and let the police do their job. So, I didn’t see anything until this morning when the police cordon was up.'
