Pastor George Hunley has been arrested for falsely reporting a crime after police said they did not believe his versions of events that he was shot 

A pastor who claimed he was shot in the arm after a man he attempted to help turned on him, has been arrested because police do not believe his 'good Samaritan' story. 

George Hunley told officers he had acted selflessly to try and help a black man and white woman on the side of the road who were having car trouble in Louisa County when he was robbed and shot twice in the leg.

Hunley, who claimed a struggle ensued during which he broke his attacker's arm, has now been arrested himself for falsely reporting a crime.

Police are now investigating how Hunley, who was arrested on Friday, suffered the gunshot wounds.

Major Donnie Lowe, the Louisa County Deputy Chief. told WRIC: 'Everything right now points to us believing that there was no armed robbery, there was no bi-racial couple, that all of that didn't happen.

'The vehicle that he was in, where he drove home from the robbery, there was no blood in it at all. And we did manage to find his wallet and his checkbook and everything in his vehicle.' 

Officers also said they had been unable to find the crime scene Hunley described. 

The 54-year-old's story began to unravel when he refused to take a polygraph test after the incident.

At the time he told WWBT: 'I'm on painkillers.

'I've been in shock. I've been shot twice. I had to wrestle for my life. There is no way in this world I'm going to take a polygraph test. They are too inconclusive.'

Police said pastor George Hunley's story did not add up and they had found his wallet in his car 

Officers said everything points to no armed robbery and no couple Hunley claims he tried to help

Hunley had previously claimed he pulled over in Chalk Level Road to help the couple, who were travelling in a blue Taurus with a one-year-old child, because they were having car trouble.

The pastor, who has been a minister for 32 years, then said the man turned on him with a gun and demanded money. 

He was released from the University of Virginia Medical Center and is due in court on February 17.
