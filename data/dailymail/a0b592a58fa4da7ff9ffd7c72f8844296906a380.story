The prospect of a Formula One race through the streets of central London took a huge step forward today when ministers entered a consultation over a radical overhaul of road safety and speed limit laws.

A detailed 3.2 mile circuit is believed to have drawn up by Formula One supremo Bernie Eccleston that would see the likes of Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton start on The Mall and race past Buckingham Palace and through Parliament Square.

Experts predict a Monaco-style event through the capital could be worth well over £100million in ticket revenue and endorsements but would currently require an Act of Parliament to suspend 30mph speed limits and other safety laws along the length of the route.

The route will take in some of the capital's most famous and iconic landmarks, including Buckingham Palace and Trafalgar Square

The event could become the richest 
race in the road with around 120,000 fans filling the grandstands around
 the capital's most famous landmarks along a 3.2 mile route with a 
potential global TV audience of a billion.

Local authorities already have the power to close roads for sporting events but not to suspend traffic laws and the requirement for a vehicle to be road legal.

The consultation launched today by Culture Secretary Maria Miller is over whether they should also be allowed to suspend the Road Traffic Act and, if successful, would pave the way for a London Grand Prix.

Mrs Miller said: 'The excitement and buzz of motor sports attracts a legion of dedicated fans and drives investment.

'Looking at whether local authorities should be able to close public roads for road races and other motor sports could mean millions of extra pounds going to local communities.

'The UK is a world leader in the motor sport industry, supporting jobs and promoting our manufacturing and high tech engineering skills.'

If the proposal is successful Formula One bosses would still need to secure permission from Westminster City Council to stage the event.

Tim Owen, the council's Events Commissioner, said: 'We are always keen for Westminster to set the stage for world-class events and attractions so will obviously be following the progress of this legislation very closely.

'If it passes, however, it would just be the first step. We would then explore the practicalities with our partners to see if and how F1 really could take to the streets of London.'

Mayor Boris Johnson has previously spoken in favour of the plan provided issues with pollution and noise impact are addressed.

His spokesperson said today: 'The Mayor thinks F1 is a fantastic event that any city would feel privileged to host, and he is always interested in projects that attract jobs and bring growth.

'He is positive that London would do a spectacular job of holding a Grand Prix; but it is impossible to say what the impact might be without detailed planning, consultation and research and the question of air quality and noise impact would have to be looked at very carefully.'

The Mayor added it was important to see if there was 'a really good economic case' for a London Grand Prix.

The idea also has the support of several senior Government ministers including Minister Without Portfolio Kenneth Clarke, Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretery, and Patrick McLoughlin.

Mr Clarke said: 'I am delighted that the Government has been able to propose the necessary legal changes to enable motor racing events to be held occasionally for various categories of racing in towns and cities in different parts of the country. 

'Sensible safety and environmental standards are always protected at sports events. 

'The proposal is to sweep away a few absurd legal problems to exempt a motor race from the ordinary traffic rules that apply to a commuter traffic jam. 

'Motor sports is one of the this country’s industrial and sporting strengths.'

Ecclestone believes the race would be even more impressive than the Monaco Grand Prix, currently the most famous and glamorous of motor racing’s street circuits.

In 2012 Ecclestone said: ‘With the way things are, maybe we would front it and put the money up for it. If we got the okay and everything was fine, I think we could do that.

'Think what it would do for tourism. It would be fantastic — good for London, good for England — a lot better than the Olympics.’

A London Grand Prix is not a new idea and was first raised by the Government in 2011, but since then the launch of a formal consultation has been tied up in Whitehall wrangling.

The move is expected to meet with opposition from environmental groups. Darren Johnson, a Green London Assembly member described the race through London as a 'terrible idea'.

He said: 'Formula One should stick to the dedicated race tracks and leave our streets form ordinary Londoners to enjoy.'

The consultation could also reach outside Formula One and remove potential legal obstacles to holding Tour de France cycle stages in Yorkshire and Cambridgeshire this July.

Under existing laws support vehicles following the riders will technically be breaking speed limits.
