One of Britain's most expensive country homes has gone on the market - and it really is fit for a Queen.

The Grade I listed Mynde Park, set in a 1,180-acre estate, has a right royal price tag - a princely £15m.

But the estate agents handling the sale say there is no shortage of potential buyers wanting to view the property.

Home fit for royalty: Mynde Park is Grade I listed and was completely renovated over a three year project by the current owners. The Queen held a picnic here in rural Herefordshire for 3,000 guests in 2003

It is one of Britain's most expensive country homes and has gone on the market for £15million. Craig Hamilton, the renowned architect, oversaw the restoration including the kitchen and study extension with private walled garden

‘The King’s Hall was described by Nikolaus Pevsner (architectural historian) as 'the finest room in Herefordshire', and has vast ceiling heights and remarkable plaster work. It takes up a large proportion of the house.

Listed: The house has 12 bedrooms, 10 of them ensuites, a drawing room, library, study and morning room. The spacious master bedroom has two dressing rooms, bathroom and shower

Stately: The estate agents handling the sale say there is no shortage of potential buyer. The extended kitchen is a wonderful family space with dining and sitting area with door out to the garden

And the guided tour can take up to four hours because there's so much to see. The Queen held a picnic at the property in rural Herefordshire for 3,000 guests.

Clive Hopkins, head of Farms and Estates for Knight Frank estate agents, said: 'It is a unique property, one of the finest anywhere in the country.

'We are getting interest from international clients, from Eastern Europe and other parts of the world.'

The dining room retains its original panelling, has a fireplace at either end and would comfortably seat at least 24 people

Mynde Park dates back to 1350 and was once the home of Walter Pye, attorney-general to Charles I. The library room enjoys views over the surrounding countryside

But the house also has 12 bedrooms, 10 of them ensuites, a drawing room, library, study, morning room, billiard room, games room, two kitchens and various cellars.

The London office of Knight Frank describe the house near the village of Much Dewchurch as 'deceptively compact' inside.

A separate five-bedroomed house - the Little Mynde - stands in the grounds, along with six cottages and an entrance lodge.

The manor is approached along a mile-long private 'carriage drive' with views of the swimming pool, gardens, lake and the surrounding Herefordshire countryside.

Local historians said Mynde Park dates back to 1350 and was once the home of Walter Pye, attorney-general to Charles I.

The house was later acquired by the Duke of Chandos who, in 1709, added the King's Hall with its Buggatti and Attari plasterwork.

It is currently owned by Caroline and Audley Twiston-Davies, whose daughter Antonia was a God-daughter of Princess Diana.

The Twiston-Davies family spent four years and millions of pounds restoring the manor house to its former glory 10 years ago.

The estate hosted the Queen, Prince Philip and 3,000 guests at a picnic in the grounds in 2003.

Mr Hopkins said: 'The joy of the manor house is it stands in the middle of its own land at the end of a mile-long drive.

'It will appeal to someone who wishes to be the master of all they survey.

'It is a rare property because this isn't about the location - it could be anywhere in Britain.

'It's all about the property, its grounds and its history,. That's what makes it unique.

'It's only been on the market for two weeks but it is attracting a lot of people and we've shown a few around.'
