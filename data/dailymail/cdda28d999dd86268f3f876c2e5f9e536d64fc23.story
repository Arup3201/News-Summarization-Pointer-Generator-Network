Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers says captain Steven Gerrard will not find an easy route back into his team on return from injury, particularly given the side's excellent form.

Gerrard has been absent from Liverpool's last six matches with a hamstring injury but he could return in this weekend's FA Cup clash with Blackburn Rover having resumed training this week.

But his manager says that with Liverpool in a good run of form, Gerrard will have to fight for a place in a side that has enjoyed success recently

Brendan Rodgers says Gerrard does not have a god-given right to return to the team straight away

'There is no-one in the squad who has a God-given right to walk straight into the team,' Rodgers said. 'It probably would be (an issue) for other people but certainly not for me and it wouldn't be for Steven. 

'He is very much a team player and if he was on the bench because the team was in good form and playing well I think everyone respects that.' 

'It wouldn't be significant for me or for him. If the team is in good form, there wouldn't be an issue. The most important thing is having Steven available.

Rodgers said Gerrard would not have a problem if he was benched for the in-form outfit

'To have him back is the most important thing. Let's see how the season pans out. Steven is one of the best players of all time in the Premier League.

'He has still got a couple of days to go and we will assess it. He is still with the rehabilitation team. The team is playing very well. To have him back available for selection is the most important thing.'

Rodgers brushed off comparisons between Gerrard and his vice-captain Jordan Henderson after the former Sunderland midfielder scored against Manchester City and Burnley.

'Jordan is a wonderful player, a different player,' he said. 'Because he shoots from outside the box doesn't mean he is the new Steven Gerrard.

'His stature as a footballer is growing all the time. He is already a first class footballer but he is going to go on and become even better.

Henderson has stood in as Liverpool captain during Gerrard's absence and has scored twice in a week

Rodgers did not want to label Henderson as the 'next Gerrard' but talked up his development

'He is vice-captain and has a wonderful role model in Steven but I would ask every young player to follow Steven Gerard by example because he is an incredible professional and football player.

'His stature as a footballer is certainly growing all the time and that is because of his performance level.

'He assists goals, he scores goals, and for me he is just improving every single day. His tactical understanding of systems is developing and he will go on over the next few years.

'He really is a first-class footballer but I think at a big club he will go on and show what a top player he is.'
