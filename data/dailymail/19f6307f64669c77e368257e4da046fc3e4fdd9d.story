Cruel: Christine Morgan (pictured) also held the child’s head under bath water, threatened to kill her and hit her in the face

A girl subjected to a decade of abuse was forced to drink bleach from a dirty cloth that had been used to clean toilets, a court heard today.

The youngster was left with a 'burning sensation' in her mouth after Christine Morgan, 61, shoved the grimy rag into her mouth.

Morgan also held the child’s head under bath water, threatened to kill her and hit her in the face.

The violence - which included grabbing the girl by the throat - started when the child was just four years old.

She is now an adult but still suffers nightmares and is 'haunted' by her memories of the widow, Southampton Crown Court heard.

A judge today told Morgan she can expect to be jailed after a jury took five hours to convict her of two charges of cruelty to a child under 16.

The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, gave evidence from behind a screen so she could not be seen from the dock.

She recalled how Morgan told her moments before holding her head under water: 'No one wants you - I’m going to murder you in the bath.'

She added: 'I have vivid dreams about when I was pushed in the bath. That’s an incident I can always remember.'

And the woman said she had been left with a 'burning sensation' in her mouth and 'felt a bit sick' after being force fed the bleach-soaked rag.

In a police interview played to the court, the victim said: 'It’s been affecting me for a long time.

'I need something to be done about it for my peace of mind because it’s affected my mental health, everything.

'It’s playing on my mind all the time. It’s always felt in the back of my head that she’s haunting me all the time and I’ve lately just cracked.

'I’m paying for what she did.'

Prosecutor Elizabeth Bussey-Jones said: 'She describes from a very early age being subjected to various forms of verbal abuse.

'She was told by Christine Morgan that she hated her, that she was a waste of space and she wanted to kill her. She recalls various acts of violence towards her.

'They vary from being pinned up by the throat against the wall, being smacked and having her hair pulled.'

Morgan, from Romsey, Hampshire, was cleared of one charge of indecent assault on a girl under 13.

She denied all charges but told police in interview: 'I would strangle her now.'

David Reid, defending, said Morgan was of previous good character and lived on her own.

Judge Gary Burrell QC told Morgan she had been convicted of 'serious offences' and 'must expect, inevitably, an immediate custodial sentence.'

She will be sentenced at a later date.
