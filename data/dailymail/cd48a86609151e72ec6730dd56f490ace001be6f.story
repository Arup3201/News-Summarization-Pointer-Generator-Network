A mother was killed on the pavement in front of her husband and two-year-old son after a pensioner ploughed into her in his Mercedes because he mistook the accelerator pedal for the brake.

Geoffrey Lederman, 83, killed Desreen Brooks and almost crashed into the whole family as he ploughed into a wall and mounted a pavement in West Hampstead in north London at 50mph.

The pensioner had been driving home from a bridge game when he realised he had lost control of the powerful 3.8 litre V8 engine Mercedes and deliberately steered it into a garden wall in a bid to stop it, Blackfriars Crown Court heard.

But Lederman had failed to spot there were pedestrians on the pavement. He clipped the toddler's pushchair before he crashed into Mrs Brooks, 33, who was killed.

Desreen Brooks, 33, was walking home with husband Ben Brooks-Dutton (left) in West Hampstead when she was hit by a mercedes driven by Geoffrey Lederman, 83, who had lost control of the car and appeared to have confused the brake and accelerator pedals as he steered it into a garden wall at 50mph in a bid to stop it 

The powerful classic car also hit a young woman who suffered brain damage and lost an eye.

Lederman has been accused of causing death by dangerous driving and grievous bodily harm, which he denies. 

The court heard Mrs Brooks had been walking home with her husband, Ben Brooks-Dutton, the boss of Mischief PR, and their son Jackson from a friend's house at the time of the accident in November 2012. 

Witnesses described seeing Lederman's car 'screaming' along the lane, amid a cloud of smoke before it hurtled along the footpath in West End Lane at speed.

Lederman ploughed into Mrs Brooks, 33, and also struck 23-year-old American student Amy Werner, who was left with permanent brain damage.

Lederman, who had impaired eyesight and had previously suffered a stroke, floored the powerful car and didn't brake once before hitting the women, the court heard.

Tom Kark QC, prosecuting, said: 'Over a period of just under 20 seconds it seems he accidentally put his foot on the accelerator instead of the brake.

'The car was very powerful and when he realised his car was out of control, not understanding why, Mr Lederman deliberately steered it onto the pavement and into the front garden wall of a house.'

Widower Ben Brooks-Dutton arrived at Blackfriars Crown Court for the trial of Geoffrey Lederman 

Jurors were shown CCTV footage of the blue Mercedes travelling at high speed before crossing onto the wrong side of the road, onto the path and into the women, at around 8.30pm.

Mr Kark added: 'The first was Desreen Brooks who was walking down the road with her husband and two-year-old who was in a pushchair.

'The car scraped the pushchair but struck Mrs Brooks killing her.

'The car continued on its journey and struck a young American student named Amy Werner and she was severely injured.

'She suffered brain injuries and lost sight in one eye.'

Lederman had spent the day at a bridge conference in Barnet, north London, before setting off for his west London home.

He suffered minor injuries in the crash and had to be cut from the wreckage of his automatic Mercedes 380SL.

Tests showed he had not been drinking and had a clean driver's licence. Investigators also found no mechanical faults with the car which he had bought second-hand in 1982.

Mr Kark said: 'There is no evidence to suggest that vehicle defects caused or contributed to the accident and neither victim caused or contributed to the collision in any way.'

Moments before the crash he had stopped to check his car after 'nudging' a pizza delivery man before carrying on his way, the court heard.

Mr Kark said: 'He said he lost control soon after that, within seconds he seemed to be on the wrong side of the road going at almost racing car speed.

'He was tugging on the handbrake with no effect.'

In the minutes before the crash Lederman's Mercedes was seen revving loudly for up to ten seconds as it sat stationary outside West Hampstead Underground Station.

The pensioner crashed into the wall at 50mph and may have confused accelerator and brake, the court heard

Investigators found he had mistakenly kept his foot on the car's accelerator when he thought it was the brake before careering off, the court heard.

London Underground staff told police that they had heard a 'loud crunching sound' seconds before.

Unlike modern automatic cars, the classic Mercedes did not require the brake to be pressed before engaging drive.

Mr Kark said: 'It may be that when Geoffery Lederman engaged the drive gear when he believed he was pressing the brake or hadn't realised the car had slipped into neutral.'

Richard Savours, a bridge partner of Geoffrey Lederman, told the court he found Mr Brooks-Dutton standing over his wife, Desreen, who was lying on the pavement, as she shouted for help. 

Mr Savours had taken part in a six hour bridge tournament with Lederman in Barnet when he overtook them on the pavement in his classic Mercedes.

He told the court: 'I heard a scraping noise. The car overtook us on the right hand side and was on the pavement scraping along walls of gardens, which is what the noise was.

'Coming up to junction with Dynham Road, the car went over the junction, crashed into a wall and came to a stop.

'My wife stopped the car as the car went past us.

'I got out of the car and immediately saw a man standing directly opposite where I was standing shouting 'Please help us, won't somebody help me?'

'I first thought he was hurt and then I saw a woman lying on the pavement and he was standing over her. She was lying completely still. My first thought was she might be dead.

Paramedics in a passing ambulance then got out to help and Mr Savours said it was impossible to get Lederman out of the car by the door as the handle had been sheered off by scraping along the wall. 

Lederman claimed he felt 'fine' throughout the day and had undergone an eye test in April 2012, adding that he didn't think he had to wear glasses as a condition of his licence but wore a contact lens in his left eye.

He said he 'saw a gap' where he could crash the car and had not seen any pedestrians, believing he had 'done the right thing'.

He told police he hadn't suffered any 'medical episode' that day and there is no evidence of a medical cause, the court heard.

Mr Kark said lawyers acting for Lederman were expected to claim he had suffered 'some sort of seizure' before the accident.

Lederman, of Maida Vale, who has been excused from attending the trial on health grounds, denies causing death by dangerous driving and grievous bodily harm.

The trial continues.
