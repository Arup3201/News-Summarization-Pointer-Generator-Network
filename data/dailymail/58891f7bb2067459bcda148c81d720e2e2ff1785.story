Yorkshire has been named the best travel destination in Europe for the second consecutive year thanks to its stunning countryside and coastline – and everything in between.

The UK's largest county received the top gong from tourism industry professionals at the World Travel Awards in Athens, beating out the likes of Barcelona, Istanbul, London, Paris and Venice.

Famed for its medieval heritage, scenic hiking trails and sandy beaches, Yorkshire's wonders are no secret to holidaymakers, registering more than 200 million visits every year.

Number one: York Minster helped Yorkshire win the title of leading travel destination in Europe for 2014

Fun in the sun: Yorkshire's tourism board says the county registers 216 million visits a year

Yorkshire's tourism industry is worth an estimated £7 billion annually and it employs almost a quarter of a million people.

Travellers flock to the county because it is steeped in history and decorated with incredible landscapes, and it offers something for every visitor.

One of its crown jewels is York Minster, the largest Gothic cathedral in Northern Europe, and it is also home to six national museums, three national parks and five Michelin star restaurants.

Ingleton Waterfalls is one of the attractions that draws millions of visitors to Yorkshire every year 

This summer, Yorkshire was propelled onto the world stage again as it hosted the first two stages of the Tour de France.

More than two million fans lined the roads in cities and towns to catch a glimpse of the competitors as they raced through the region, giving another boost to the tourism industry in God's Own County. 

London is a 10-time winner of the award introduced in 1996 and it was the last destination to win back-to-back titles (2007 and 2008).

Yorkshire was a double winner on the night as the Welcome to Yorkshire tourism agency won the award for the best marketing campaign at a ceremony hailed as 'the Oscars of the travel industry'.

The ancient Acropolis of Athens edged Rome's Colosseum and Paris' Eiffel Tower as Europe's top attraction

Travel agents cast votes to crown Europe's best in more than 80 categories, ranging from the top airport hotel and leading chauffeur company to the most romantic resort and best travel club.

Athens' Acropolis was named the leading tourist attraction, while the top island destination was the Portuguese archipelago of Madeira.

The leading beach destination was Corfu in Greece and the top city break destination was Geneva, Switzerland.
