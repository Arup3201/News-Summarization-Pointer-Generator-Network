Resigned: Afzal Amin was exposed after plotting with far-Right extremists to stir up racial hatred 

The Tory Election candidate exposed for plotting with far-Right extremists to stir up racial hatred is a former member of a fanatical Islamic sect that believes the Nazis were misunderstood and that Jews control the world.

Afzal Amin, who resigned after The Mail on Sunday published undercover recordings of him meeting the English Defence League, joined the Birmingham wing of the Murabitun, a fundamentalist cult which questioned the Holocaust and praised Hitler.

In 1992 when Amin was 18, he left the group, founded by Scottish hippy Ian Dallas, after becoming disillusioned. 

Two years later, a book crediting him as author Raja Afzal Raza Amin al-Quraishy, was published in which he criticised the Murabitun and called for jihadi warriors to establish a Muslim state in Europe.

Amin says his words were doctored to include the extremist views, which he yesterday described as ‘disgusting’. 

In the pamphlet Amin – described last week by a colleague as a ‘Walter Mitty character’ – demeans women and calls for restaurants that serve alcohol to be burned.

The book, which is entitled Ian Dallas: The Shaykh Who Has No Clothes, criticised the group for not being radical enough. 

It states: ‘My troubles with the Birmingham community began when I realised that we were all illiterate, in Shar’iah terms, ignorant, and nobody had a plan to take the city in which we lived.

‘My pushing for study of the Shar’iah and a militant Islam resulted in my expulsion to Slough.

‘Those of us in the cities of Europe need to free ourselves economically from kafir [unbeliever] institutions, state and private, by creating our own arenas of trade, with Islamic coinage… and the building of independent villages for Muslims, from where the mujahidun [jihad warriors] can burst out and conquer lands establishing Dar ul-Islam [a Muslim region].

Extracts: Passages from the pamphlet credited to Afzal Amin

‘May Allah bless the men currently engaged in military conflict against the kuffar [unbeliever] and may He assist us in preparing the liberation of the Muslims wherever we are.’

Recounting the tale of another Muslim, a passage in the book says that he ‘as any man would, refused to be taught the “methodology of jihad” by a female. You see nobody can be strengthened by somebody that is weaker.’

Discussing Indian restaurants which sell alcohol, he says: ‘My complaint is primarily with the hypocrisy of a group of people who claim to be the “cutting edge” of Islam, yet instead of burning the alcohol-selling restaurants are accepting…’

Last week, former student Abu Abdullah, who said he met Amin while studying at the School of African and Oriental Studies in London, claims Amin proudly gave him a copy of the pamphlet in 1998.

He said: ‘We were shocked when we saw what he had written and asked him to move out.’

Amin said yesterday: ‘This work is not a book, it is merely stapled photocopied pages. It has been the subject of legal action and any suggestion that I share these views is defamatory. My rights were infringed by the author.

‘When I was 19 years old I was asked by a former member of the group to send him my account of the few months I spent with them.

‘He has inserted phrases throughout which are not my words and the last few paragraphs are a complete fabrication. I have been actively opposing such extreme and rejectionist views my whole life.’

Amin, 40, was exposed for hatching a plot with the EDL to announce a demonstration in his Dudley North constituency which would then be cancelled, allowing him to claim credit for brokering peace. 

A Muslim campaigner claims Amin asked him to publicly attack his military career to make him more appealing to working-class white voters.

Asghar Bukhari, founding member of the Muslim Public Affairs Committee UK, said: ‘He thought it would help distance him from Muslims and get white people to support him.’

Amin responded: ‘If I have met him I do not recall doing so.’

AND... He hinted at Westminster deal for lobbyist

Amin wanted cash in exchange for helping clients once elected, it is claimed. Financial services lobbyist Simon Gentry said Amin told him he would ‘take care of his clients’ and be ‘a friend in the House’. Mr Gentry added: ‘He worded it in a way that sounded financially beneficial to him.’ Amin said: ‘No such discussion took place.’ 

AND... He 'was always abroad' 

Amin preferred going abroad to canvassing, according to Anne Millward, of Dudley North Tory Association. She said: ‘He was often disappearing on trips to Dubai and Somalia.’ Amin said: ‘Performance issues should be referred to the party.’ 

So why DID the Tories let him stand for a seat? 

Serious questions were raised last night over the vetting process which put Afzal Amin on Tory Central Office’s ‘approved list’ of candidates.

Calls for a review came from the leader of his local constituency association, who said Dudley North had been saddled with a ‘complete maverick’.

Anne Millward said: ‘On paper, Afzal Amin was a very good candidate when he was selected in 2013, but I think the whole process needs to be thoroughly looked at after this Election.

‘If someone is on the list, you would have thought that they’d have been thoroughly vetted by Central Office and they’d be there on merit, but you then find you’ve got a complete maverick who doesn’t want to do what he’s told or toe the party line.’

Of Mr Amin’s explanation about the fake EDL march idea – comparing it to ‘negotiations with the Taliban’ – Mrs Millward added: ‘This is not Kandahar. It’s Dudley North.’

Meanwhile, Paul Goodman, editor of the Conservative Home website for grassroots members, said a long and highly critical comment about Amin’s military career – describing him as ‘a fantasist with questionable integrity’ – was posted at the end of an article Amin wrote 16 weeks ago, but was not followed up.

‘I’m sure plenty of senior people in the party would have seen it,’ said former MP Mr Goodman. ‘You might have thought it would ring alarm bells.’
