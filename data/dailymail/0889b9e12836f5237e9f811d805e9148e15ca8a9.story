The Queen has sent a message of support to the first Canadian astronaut to take command of the international space station.

Colonel Chris Hadfield, 53, a former test pilot and Twitter sensation, is now in control of the orbiting station after taking over from a Nasa colleague.

The Queen said in her message: 'I am pleased to transmit my personal best wishes, and those of all Canadians, to Colonel Christopher Hadfield as he takes command of the International Space Station on Wednesday.

Regal: Colonel Chris Hadfield, of the Canadian Space Agency, seen here aboard the International Space Station, has been honoured with a message of goodwill from Queen Elizabeth. He said it made his 'jaw drop'

Her transmission to the International Space Station said: 'I am pleased to transmit my personal best wishes, and those of all Canadians, to Colonel Christopher Hadfield as he takes command of the International Space Station'

'Our thoughts and best wishes are with him and the entire crew, as are our prayers for an eventual safe return to family, friends and fellow Canadians.'

Col Hadfield, a prolific Twitter user with more than 500,000 followers, tweeted in response: 'If anything can make one's jaw drop in weightlessness, it is to be honoured by the Queen herself.

'I am amazed & humbled.'

His mission on the space station began in December when he and colleagues blasted into space aboard a Russian rocket and he will remain in orbit until May.

In June 1992 he was selected to become an astronaut - one of four chosen out of 5,330 applicants - and three years later was part of a Nasa space shuttle mission that docked with the Russian space station Mir.

He also became the first Canadian to complete a space walk in 2001, helping to install a robot crane on the international space station.

He has been orbiting over the UK today and earlier tweeted about different parts of the country he could see.

The astronaut even tweeted a picture and described the image: 'Hull and the Humber Estuary, Yorkshire, England, on a picture-perfect beautiful day.'

The astronaut told Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper that his role was crucial: 'If someone has a serious medical problem...if we had a major technical emergency on board, a puncture, so that we start losing pressure, or contaminated atmosphere or smoke or fire, then...I am in charge.'Â
