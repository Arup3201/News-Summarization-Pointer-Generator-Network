An Arizona high school may face charges it violated the civil rights of minority students after it held a 'Redneck Day' for students.

The school-wide event May 1 at Queen Creek High School, just outside Phoenix, AZ, was designed to satirize a reality TV show called 'Duck Dynasty,' school officials said, but what started as a way to motivate students to attend the prom ended up outraging minorities around the country, prompting the US Department of Education to open an investigation.

Federal investigators will be investigating the extent of the hostilities created in the school by the ill-advised festival.

The investigation will look into 'whether a racially hostile environment was created due to language and actions that were not protected by the First Amendment,' a letter from the DOE to the Reverend Jarrett Maupin II, who filed a complaint over the controversial celebration.

One student wore a large Confederate flag to school, which he is allowed to do under his First Amendment rights, but was asked to take it off and did, according to the letter.

'The display of the Confederate flag concerns rights protected by the First Amendment,' the letter continued.

Seemingly pleased with the impending investigation, Rev. Maupin said the DOE will 'determine the remedy, including moderating conversations between school administrators and civil rights community leaders to shape new policy and racism prevention measures.'

Local residents were outraged by the racially insensitive send-up of the hit TV show.

'We all know the connotation of 
"redneck," Rev. Ozetta Kirby, pastor of Holy Trinity Community AME 
Church in nearby Mesa told the newspaper.

The day 'really got to' his 16-year-old grandson, Marcus, who attends the school, Rev. Kirby added.

Steve Montoya, a prominent civil-rights attorney in Phoenix, said the Confederate flag was the most offensive part.

'The Confederacy represents the horrible 
institution of slavery, and that is a direct attack on 
African-Americans, Mr. Montoya told the Arizona Republic.

The only intent of 'Redneck Day' was to spoof the characters on the reality show, which follows a family of duck hunters in Louisiana, Tom Lindsey, the superintendent of the Queen Creek Unified School District, told the paper.

He said the student wearing the Confederate flag wasn't from Arizona and didn't appreciate the reaction the flag would receive.

The boy was pulled aside and asked to change his clothes by an assistant principal and the meaning of the flag in Arizona was explained to him.

'We apologize to any people who, because of the word (redneck), were offended,' said Mr. Lindsey.
