We've only just got used to younger generations talking about selfies and twerking â€“ but 2013â€™s most popular words are already in danger of being overtaken by a new set of weird and wonderful terms.

Expert Adam Jacot de Boinod has released his annual list of words creeping into newspapers, broadcasts and on electronic and social media over the past 12 months, which include phubbing, facekini and on the bubble.

Here are just some of the dozens of additions to the English language he identified, a legacy for which future generations may or may not be grateful...
