Ross Mc Ewan, chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland, will not take a £1million bonus this year

The chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland has admitted it will still pay 'outrageous' bonuses totalling £421million as the bank posted losses of £3.5billion. 

Ross McEwan, who took over running the ailing bank in 2012 after it was bailed out by the taxpayer, said he will not take a £1million bonus this year.

He conceded that people were 'quite right' to regard the bonuses as outrageous - but said there was nothing he could do to change this  because it was necessary to pay people awards to carry out 'fairly technical' jobs.

RBS, which is 80 per cent owned by the taxpayer and was bailed out in 2008, posted a £3.5billion deficit this year - the seventh consecutive year of losses.

The losses suffered by the bank now total £50billion.  

Mr McEwan said the bank had become 'stronger and simpler' but said there was still a long way to go and they were focusing on getting the 'bank back for shareholders, who are effectively the British public.'  

The chief executive said he had decided not to take his bonus this year because he wanted to focus on getting the bank back to the highest possible standard.

He said: 'What I can do is give you the guarantee we are building a really good customer bank and we are centering that bank on the areas that are strong in the UK and in western Europe so we can get it right.' 

This is the second time Mr McEwan has decided to forgo the annual bonus awarded on top of his salary, which is expected to top £2.7million this year.

The company's bonus pool was cut by 21 per cent to £421 million for 2014, but customers have criticised the high award levels. 

Mr McEwan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme people were 'quite right' to regard the £421 million in bonuses that the bank was handing out as 'outrageous'.

'Yes, and to be quite honest they are right,' he said.

'It's not something I am going to change or can change today. What I can do is focus on this business and you are starting to see the progress we have made after one year.' 

The bank posted losses of £3.5billion this year - the seventh successive year of losses for RBS 

Role-based allowances are designed to allow the banks to get around the EU bonus cap. This came into force on January 1 last year and limits annual payouts for 2014 onwards to 100 per cent of annual salary, or a maximum of 200 per cent with shareholder approval. 

Mr McEwan, who took over managing the bank from Stephen Hester,  said he understood the issues with the bonuses being paid, but it was important to get fair pay for people to do highly technical jobs. 

RBS also confirmed that Sir Howard Davies, the former head of the now defunct Financial Services Authority, will be its chairman from September. He replaces Sir Philip Hampton, who is set to join GlaxoSmithKline.

In a letter to Sir Howard, Chancellor George Osborne called on the new chairman to ensure the bank's business is 'conducted to the very highest ethical standards' and said he would not expect senior executives to be given bonuses. 

'I would also expect that, as in the past, no executive directors or members of the executive committee will receive bonuses, despite improved profitability,' he wrote. 

'Given the extraordinary support it has enjoyed in the past from taxpayers, I know you recognise that RBS must remain a backmarker on pay and continue to show responsibility and restraint.'

* Chairman of the UK Airports Commission, which is due to recommend where to build a new UK runway shortly after the general election.

* He will complete his work with the Airports Commission before taking the role at RBS, when Sir Philip Hampton steps down on September 1.  

* Sir Howard is also a non-executive director of Prudential and a board member of Morgan Stanley.

* 1997 - 2003 - Worked as chairman of the Financial Services Authority (FSA). 

Sir Howard was a director at LSE 

* 2011 - Resigned from his position as director of the London School of Economics after it accepted funding from a foundation linked to the family of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

* The incoming RBS chairman has also been director general of the CBI and chief executive of the Audit Commission.

It is the seventh successive year of losses, taking the running total to nearly £50 billion since it was bailed out in 2008.

But the bank's losses this year are considerably less than the losses of £9billion the year before.

Last year the government warned RBS it should not go ahead with a planned £576million worth of bonuses as it slipped £8.2billion into the red.  

Mr McEwan also said he could not give a guarantee that there would not be a repeat of scandals such as fixing of the Libor rate.

He also said while it would not be months before the bank was able to return to the private sector, it certainly wouldn't be as along as ten years. 

The bank is cutting some of its overseas business, and Mr McEwan said there would be inevitable job cuts.  

RBS said the latest loss was attributable to a £4 billion write-down on the value of its US arm Citizens, having recently cut its stake in the business.

Operating profits were £3.5 billion - the highest since 2010 - as RBS said it had made significant progress towards building a bank that is 'stronger, simpler and better for both customers and shareholders'.

Other one-off items included £2.2 billion of conduct and litigation charges, including £320 million in the fourth quarter relating to the rigging of foreign exchange markets and a further £400 million to cover compensation for the mis-selling of payment protection insurance.

After news of the £3.5billion profit was released shares initially consolidated at their three-year high above 400p before slipping more than three per cent or 14p to 389.2p.

Investec Securities analyst Ian Gordon reiterated his sell rating and noted a bigger-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter of the year.
