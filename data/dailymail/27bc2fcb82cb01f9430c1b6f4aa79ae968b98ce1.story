The Bali Nine duo could have their case delayed for months, after The Indonesian Supreme Court has agreed to review the case of a Filipina drug courier scheduled to be shot at the same time.

Indonesian courts have consistently said they will execute all 10 drug felons at the same time, while the review is expected to take months.

The Supreme Court said a panel of judges would be appointed this week to review the case of Filipina domestic worker Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso, a process which can take up to three months, reports Sydney Morning Herald.

The pair may be waiting months for their execution as the review of Filipina domestic worker Mary Jane Fiesta Veloso could take up to three months

Veloso was sentenced to death in 2010 for attempting to smuggle 2.6 kilograms of heroin from Malaysia to Yogyakarta.

She maintains she was deceived and did not know the drugs were in her luggage. 

The family of Brazilian Rodrigo Gularte are appealing for his life to be spared on account of him being diagnosed with schizophrenia. 

Nine of the ten drug felons set to be executed together have now launched legal proceedings. 

It comes after Attorney-General spokesman Tony Spontana said all ten prisoners would face the firing squad simultaneously.

'We don't want one to have to wait for another's execution before his own. That will affect the convicts' psychological state,' he said.

The Indonesian Governor-General has said the death row inmates will be executed 'simultaneously'

Mr Prasetyo also claims the death row inmates will be put through an 'assimilation' process which he believes will help them mentally prepare for their death.

'They will be accompanied by religious figures until they're truly ready,' he said. 

The two men are currently being held in isolation cells where they are able talk to each other. 

Their interaction with other inmates is limited to one Nigerian who is also on death row.

Prison authorities claim there's been no order to move Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran from 'Death Island' even though the appeals process may be lengthy.

Although the appeals process may be lengthy there have been no orders to transfer Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan from the prison referred to as 'Death Island'

President Widodo is adamant he will show no leniency to drug offenders caught on his shores 

The pair's lawyers will return to Jakarta court on Thursday to challenge President Widodo's decision to deny clemency to all drug offenders.

Their last appeal was adjourned until March 20 as the president's representative did not have the required legal documentation.

Two weeks earlier, the Administrative Court dismissed their argument that President Widodo failed to consider their rehabilitation.

The claim was rejected on the grounds that the court had no authority to overturn presidential decree.

The Australian government, alongside several notable public figures, have made repeated pleas to spare the lives of Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has written to the Indonesia government offering to cover the cost of life imprisonment for the condemned pair if they agree to call off their executions. 

Ms Bishop is yet to receive a response.
