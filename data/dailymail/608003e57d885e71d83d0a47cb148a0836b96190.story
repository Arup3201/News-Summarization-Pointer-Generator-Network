In New York, this will not have gone down well. In Chelsea, West London, they won’t be too thrilled either.

Manchester City’s decision to keep Frank Lampard in England rather than release him to fulfil an obligation to their feeder club New York City FC has been received predictably badly in the United States. At a stroke the Barclays Premier League champions have undermined the very credibility of their MLS project and alienated a customer base they have desperately been trying to court.

Here on our side of the Atlantic, though, Lampard has simply proved too valuable to lose and it was perhaps to be expected that he would play a defining role in his first appearance since his decision to remain at City until the end of the season was announced late on New Year’s Eve.

What Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho thinks now of his own decision to release Lampard last summer only he will know. What is beyond doubt, though, is that the 36-year-old has already played a significant part in shaping the landscape of this Premier League season.

Back in September Lampard scored his first City goal to hold Chelsea to a 1-1 draw here. On New Year's Day he scored his fifth in the league after coming off the substitutes’ bench to rescue his team when calamity beckoned for the second home game running.

Having scored twice through Yaya Toure and Stevan Jovetic to lead in the second half, City were inexplicably pegged back by a Sunderland team that had spent much of the afternoon showing absolutely no attacking intent at all.

But Lampard’s headed goal from a Gael Clichy cross with 15 minutes to go was straight from the back catalogue. It was born of technique, timing and anticipation and perhaps it was only to be expected.

Having thrown away two points so carelessly here against Burnley at the weekend, City certainly needed something from this.

Manuel Pellegrini did his best to bring some freshness to his team, resting goalkeeper Joe Hart and rotating a number of other positions. Interestingly, Lampard began the afternoon on the bench.

For almost an hour, however, City toiled. Sunderland came to Manchester determined to frustrate the champions by setting up camp on the edge of their penalty area. 

Given the attacking talent they have available, one would have expected City to break through but it was only in the last half hour of the game that they found something of their true selves.

Prior to that, City were very average indeed, looking just as leggy and short of ideas as they had last time out.

In the first half, precious little of note actually happened.

Toure – back in the team after being rested at the weekend – saw one shot blocked by a sea of red and white bodies while David Silva drove the follow-up wide.

Silva himself then had a shot saved on the half an hour, as did Toure from the edge of the area moments later. It was Sunderland, however, who came closest to scoring as Sebastian Larsson brought a full length save from Willy Caballero with a right foot free-kick.

At this stage referee Roger East wasn’t winning any friends at the Etihad with some decisions that angered the City faithful and the usually phlegmatic Pellegrini. City, though, were not helping themselves. Their football lacked real quality and, unusually, their discipline was sketchy too.

In to the second half, though, and Toure eventually scored to bring the game to life.

Some goal it was, too, as Stevan Jovetic laid the ball back to Toure and the big Ivorian drove it high past former City goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon from 20 yards.

It really was a special goal and it set the tone for the rest of the afternoon.

Moments later City were two ahead and seemingly home and hosed. Jovetic laid the ball off to Clichy down the left and then made terrific ground in to the penalty area to nudge the ensuing low cross in to the corner with an elaborate flick.

Just as they did on Sunday, City looked comfortable and Sunderland’s race – such as it was – seemed run.

Once again, though, the hosts faltered and moments after Jesus Navas ran clear to hit the post Sunderland hot back to score two goals in three minutes, both coming from former City players.

First holding midfield player Jack Rodwell leapt above Clichy at a corner to head in to the far corner and then Adam Johnson buried a penalty after Pablo Zabaleta had felled Sunderland full back Billy Jones rather like a lumberjack would fell a tree.

With just over a quarter of an hour to go, City were facing embarrassment and frustration for the second time in just a few days.

This time, though, Lampard emerged to rescue them. The 36-year-old had only been on the field four minutes when he drifted in to the box off Wes Brown’s shoulder to head Clichy’s cross down and in to the corner, the ball brushing the post as it went in.

It was a classic Lampard moment and one that showed why City have risked such a PR disaster in America in order to keep him. The Premier League is all that matters here and Lampard would appear to have a role to play between now and May, whether the good folk of New York like it or not.
