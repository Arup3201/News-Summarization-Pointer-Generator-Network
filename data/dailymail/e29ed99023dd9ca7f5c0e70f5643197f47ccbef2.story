A one-year-old puppy has been left with casts on both of his front legs after they were broken when a brick fell on them. 

Bruno, a Chihuahua-terrier cross, was left in agony after fracturing both his front legs in the accident.

But after undergoing extensive surgery, the puppy is now on the road to recovery.

Severe breaks: These x-rays show where Bruno's legs were broken - just above his paws on both sides

He will have to wear the casts for a few more weeks and will then be put up for adoption.

Dr Zach Crouse, who treated Bruno at MSPCA-Angell’s Emergency and Critical Care Unit in Boston, said: 'This dog’s legs were very obviously and very badly fractured.

'Not only could he not bear weight, but his two front limbs were completely limp.  And he was in severe pain.'

Bruno was taken to the centre on March 24 by his owners who claimed he sustained the injuries when a brick fell on him.

He was immediately given pain medication while x-rays were carried out.

They revealed the severe fractures would need surgery and Bruno was taken into the operating theatre.

Help: Bruno's owners took him to MSPCA-Angell in Boston and decided to leave him in the charity's care. He is now being looked after by veterinary technician Andrea Bessler, pictured, until he is adopted

Looking for a new home: Bruno will get his casts off in a few weeks and can then be put up for adoption

Angell surgeons Andrew Goodman and Matthew Cleveland inserted plates and screws to bind Bruno’s leg bones and he was fitted with casts on both legs.

Bruno is recovering from surgery but will not be ready for adoption for at least six more weeks. 

Bruno's owners decided to leave him in the care of the charity.

He is currently in foster care in the home of Andrea Bessler, veterinary technician at the MSPCA’s Shalit-Glazer clinic in Boston, which is adjacent to the charity's adoption center.

According to Ms Bessler, Bruno is not letting his injury hold him back. 

She said: 'Of the many dogs and other animals I’ve fostered while they recover from injury or illness, Bruno is one of the most playful, charming and all-around most socialized.

'He gets along perfectly with my other pets and my children and I’m sure that after he’s completely healed he’s going to make one very lucky adopter feel very special.'

Bruno is expected to be available for adoption within two months.

Playful: Staff say Bruno hasn't let his injuries prevent him from getting around - or begging for treats
