Flower bulbs sold for up to £100 each at a rural horticultural show after hundreds of buyers from all around the world sought to take advantage of beautiful blooms following Britain's warmest year on record.

Keen gardeners from the UK, Europe and even the United States flocked to the 'Great Snowdrop Rush' sale at Myddelton House Gardens in Enfield, Greater London, on Saturday to get their hands on the in-demand bulbs.

Many paid up to £100 for a single bulb of the white flowering Galanthus – also known as the Castle Green Dragon – which were on sale from Cambridge's Monksilver Nursery.

The sought-after bloom – which has green outer leaves and a stunning white 'snowdrop' flower – was described as a 'lovely virescent plicate from Scotland' and a 'snowdrop of great quality'.

While several people splashed out on the bulbs, others paid between £10 and £20 for a plant at the event.

Andrew Turvey, head gardener at Myddelton House Gardens, said 'people will pay a lot for a particular snowdrop.'

He told The Sunday Telegraph: 'They attract a very dedicated breed of enthusiast.'

Despite the considerable price tag for the snowdrops at the event, it is not the most ever paid for a Galanthus bulb.

In February 2012, a single Scottish Elizabeth Harrison snowdrop bulb was sold for a record £725 on eBay.

The record-breaking sale more than doubled the price of the previous most expensive bulb, a Green Tear, which went for £360 at the beginning of 2012.

Snowdrops are considered highly-valuable among keen horticulturists, with many collectors hiring security guards or using tags to protect their rare species.

An increasing number of galanthopiles – snowdrop collectors – are willing to pay hundreds of pounds for the small white flowers, which first became fashionable in the mid-19th century.

There are at least 20 species of wild snowdrops in the world, with more than 2,000 cultivated varieties.

Saturday's sale comes after a study by the Botanical Society of England and Ireland recorded a whopping 2,908 plants currently in flower across the country.

The study of Britain's flora and fauna – dubbed the New Year Plant Hunt – found a total of 368 different species of flower across England and Ireland.

Dr Tim Rich, co-founder of the Society's plant hunt, said: 'With 2014 being the warmest year on record, we were expecting lots of wild flowers still to be in bloom over New Year.

'368 species in flower is an unprecedented 15 per cent of the flowering plants in Britain and Ireland. The books suggest there should only be 20-30 species in flower.

'The most commonly recorded plants were daisy and dandelion, each of which were recorded in 115 lists (75 per cent).

'As expected, the mild south and west of Britain had the highest numbers of species still in flower, but we also had lists of over 50 species from the east and north of England, and an amazing 39 flowering in Edinburgh.'
