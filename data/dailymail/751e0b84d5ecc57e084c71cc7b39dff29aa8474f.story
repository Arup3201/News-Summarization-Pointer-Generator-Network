It takes high-tech computing power, dummies fitted with up to $700,000 in sensors and about 600 tests a year to ensure Ford vehicles meet global safety standards.

The car manufacturer today opened the doors of its Dearborn Development Center in Michigan to show what it takes to get a new vehicle on the road.

Ford, which recently completed its 20,000th crash test since 1954 at Dearborn, this afternoon put a 2014 Explorer through its paces.

In the blink of an eye, the vehicle rolled down a track and slammed into a barrier at 30 miles an hour, with slow motion cameras and expensive dummies capturing every millisecond.

Test: Ford invited reporters to its Dearborn Development Center in Michigan today to watch a crash test demonstration involving a 2014 Ford Explorer

Wrecked: The 2014 Ford Explorer rebounded off the barrier after colliding at 30 mph during a crash test demonstration at Ford Motor Company's Dearborn Development Center today

Protection: The demonstration showed how an airbag protected the face of a crash test dummy following a collision

Measurements: The faces of the crash test dummies are painted so analysts can see where they hit the airbag during a collision

Fordâ€™s Steve Kenner said the company is constantly updating its testing regimen to keep up with changing safety standards. One of the latest tests, for example, involves
 simulating a crash into a tree or phone pole.

'We need to make sure these global products can meet all of the regulatory and public domain testing requirements for the markets that they are going to,' Kenner told CBS Detroit.

The automaker has more than 500 safety engineers around the world 
who have conducted more than 31,000 tests at 1,800 sites.

Crash test dummies: Ford uses these full-scale anthropomorphic test devices which represent children and adults in their crash tests

Costly: Dummies cost between $50,000 to $700,000 each when fully instrumented

Sensors: Crash test dummies are fitted with up to 100 devices streaming 300 channels of data to document the impact and effects of a collision

Detroit Free Press reported Ford has more 
than 100 dummies - or full-scale anthropomorphic test devices (ATD) - ranging from an 18-month-old toddler for 
child seat testing to a large male.

They range in price from $50,000 
to $700,000 each when fitted out with up to 100 
devices which stream 300 channels of data 
documenting the collision impact.

The crash vehicle is also painted to 
highlight critical elements, with sensors, accelerometers and high-speed cameras 
installed to capture as many as 30 different views of the crash and 
measure the forces of the impact.

The faces of the dummies are also painted to show where they hit the airbag. 

Expert: Jerome Ng, supervisor of full-vehicle crash and ATD Laboratories, examines the data collected from full-scale anthropomorphic test devices used during crash tests

Research: Ford has performed two million crash test simulations in the past ten years

Dearborn crash lab supervisor  Jerome Ng said the crash data, which is downloaded within half an 
hour of the crash, is analyzed over about two weeks. 

But before a vehicle is launched into a wall, engineers spend weeks running 
thousands of computer simulations.

Detroit Free Press reported Ford has 
increased its computing power by 50 percent in the last decade and is doubling its
 power every two years to produce safer vehicles.
