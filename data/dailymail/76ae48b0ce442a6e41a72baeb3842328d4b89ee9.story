A female British terror suspect dubbed the 'White Widow' has broken cover to have a Twitter spat with a fellow fanatic.

Fugitive Samantha Lewthwaite, wife of London 7/7 suicide bomber Jermain Lindsay, called suspected terror chief Omar Shafik Hammami  'an irritating prat' during the online feud.Hammami - also known as Abu Mansoor - who has a Â£3.3million price on his head, responded by dismissing Lewthwaite as just 'a girl in Kenya.'

Lewthwaite, 29, who is wanted by authorities in Kenya for involvement in an alleged bomb plot, used Twitter to call Hammami an 'irritating obnoxious contemptible little Muj PRAT.'

When he called her just a 'girl in Kenya' she responded by saying 'yes, am a girl in Kenya like dat makes a difference u misogynist!'

The row is believed to stem from a feud involving US-born Hammami and the al-Shabaab network, which supports al-Qaeda, according to The Sun.

Lewthwaite, from Aylesbury, 
Buckinghamshire, is being hunted by Kenyan police after they foiled a 
plan to blow up Western hotels in Mombasa in 2011.

It is thought she may be sheltered in either Somalia or Kenya by Al Shabaab, the East African arm of Al Qaeda.

Her former husband, Lindsay, carried out the worst single attack during the 7/7 bombings. Lewthwaite was seven months pregnant when he blew up a Piccadilly Line train in 2005, killing 26.

She is believed to have travelled to East Africa on a stolen passport where police believe she became an integral member of Al Shabaab.
