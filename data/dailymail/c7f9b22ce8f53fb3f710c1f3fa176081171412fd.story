Southampton boss Ronald Koeman says he would jump at the chance to manage former club Barcelona after admitting his deep affinity with the Catalan giants.

The Dutch coach spent six seasons playing for the La Liga club, winning four consecutive league titles and a European Cup between 1989 and 1995.

Koeman, who has led Southampton to the brink of qualifying for Europe despite the club selling several of its best players last summer, also joined Barcelon'a backroom staff becoming assistant to Louis van Gaal in 1998.

The 51-year-old was also asked about the possibility of replacing Manuel Pellegrini, who is under increasing pressure after falling behind Chelsea in the Premier League title race and facing elimination from the Champions League - as Manchester City manager.

'I am friends with [director of football] Txiki [Begiristain], there is contact with him and he has my telephone number,' Koeman said.
