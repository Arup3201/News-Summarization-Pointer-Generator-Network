The Queen and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been voted as the public figures who provide Britons with 'moral leadership' according to a poll.

The findings released in a YouGov survey suggested that Britons looked towards the actions of  the Royal family ahead of church leaders like the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby.

The poll surveyed 2,109 adults and asked respondents to choose three or four names from a list of public personalities who they believed showed strong moral leadership.

Guidance: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, pictured, was not seen as providing 'moral leadership'

The Queen -- 34% 

Duke and Duchess of Cambridge -- 30%

Malala Yousafzai -- 19%

Archbishop of Canterbury -- 15%

David Cameron --8% 

At least 34 per cent chose the Queen and she was followed by her grandson Prince William, and his wife Kate who snagged 30 per cent of the vote.

It's a far cry from the scandals which dogged the Royals in the 1990s when a series of divorces and the death of Princess Diana threatened to eclipse the monarchy. 

The Royals, however, were closely followed by Pakistani teenager Malala Yousafzai, who gained international notoriety when she was shot by the Taliban for going to school.

She received 19 per cent of the vote. And was recently honoured when she became the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, at a ceremony in Oslo on December 10.

The Pakistani teenager was ahead of Justin Welby, who only came in fourth place in the poll. 

But the findings come as The Church of England revealed it attracts fewer than 800,000 worshippers to its churches on a typical Sunday.

The amount of people sitting in the pews has fallen to less than half the levels of the 1960s.

The signs of continuing decline in support for the CofE followed census evidence of a widespread fall in allegiance to Christianity.

Meanwhile, British politicians did not do very well as  champions of moral leadership, the poll revealed.

British Prime Minister David Cameron only managed to get fifth place, with 8 per cent of the vote. 

Labour leader Ed Miliband landed 15th place with just 5 per cent of the vote. 

Meanwhile, Nigel Farage, of Ukip, got 39 per cent of the vote for worst moral leadership.
