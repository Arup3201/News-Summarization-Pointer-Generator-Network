Game: The Duke of Edinburgh on a shoot in Suffolk in 2008. He has recently been joining shooting parties at Balmoral to regain his strength following surgery

It’s a particularly regal form of recuperation. Since arriving at Balmoral three weeks ago, Prince Philip has been joining the shooting parties at the Scottish estate in a bid to regain his strength after undergoing major surgery.

The Duke of Edinburgh had an exploratory abdominal operation in June, spending 11 days in hospital followed by a two-month period of convalescence at Sandringham.

The 92-year-old is now back on his feet and, according to a source, has been enjoying grouse shoots at the Royal Family’s retreat. The source said: ‘Philip goes on all the shoots. He says he’s feeling fine. He only goes out for half a day and then joins the Queen for lunch.’

The Duke, a formidable shot, was told to give up shooting after a heart scare in December 2011 because doctors feared the recoil could dislodge a stent fitted to unblock a coronary artery.

Prince Philip was said to have accepted their advice reluctantly in the hope that it was on a temporary basis. Last night, Palace officials claimed the Duke had not picked up a gun in two years, although they admitted he still enjoys accompanying shooting parties.

In fact, he is believed to have gone on a hare shoot earlier this year.

The source said: ‘He goes out in the morning and insists he’s now on the mend.’

The Queen traditionally spends the summer at the 50,000-acre estate and is usually joined for the duration by her husband, while other members of the Royal Family drop in. This year, Philip arrived on August 12 – the first day of the grouse season – more than a fortnight after the Queen as he was not well enough to travel.

Prince Edward, Prince Andrew, the Duchess of York and Princess Beatrice have all been to stay.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are also expected to introduce baby George to the Duke of Edinburgh within the next three weeks.

Philip is the only member of the Royal Family not to have met the new arrival.
