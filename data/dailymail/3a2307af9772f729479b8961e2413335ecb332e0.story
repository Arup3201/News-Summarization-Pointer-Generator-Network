One man has set about transforming weapons of manifest brutality into objects of sublime beauty by creating amazing rare jewellery out of war zone weapons.

Fonderie 47, run by Peter Thum, is a social venture that removes AK47s from war zones and transforms them into rare jewellery and accessories.

Thum
became so outraged by the extreme violence and mass deaths he had 
witnessed during his time in The Democratic Republic of Congo, that he 
decided to create some optimism in the form of these ornate, wearable 
creations.

And he has even called in renowned designer James de 
Givenchy, (nephew of fashion designer Givenchy) to lend a creative eye 
to the latest collection, which features ten limited edition pieces 
crafted from AK47 steel, sustainably sourced 18-karat rose gold, 
platinum, and conflict-free diamonds.

Lethal weapon: The collection features ten limited edition pieces crafted from AK47 steel, sustainably sourced 18-karat rose gold, platinum, and conflict-free diamonds. Cuff (L) £28,000, Ring (R) £38,000

Nearly a decade after selling 
social-consciousness-raising Ethos Water to Starbucks for $8 million, 
New York–based Thum set up, Fonderie 47, with similar humanitarian 
ambitions.

Alarmed by the spread of an estimated 100 million assault 
rifles throughout Africa, Thum began purchasing confiscated AK-47s from 
the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2010 to make jewellery from the 
parts.

Making a change: Fonderie 47 only utilises guns procured through verified government sources, thereby erasing demand for replacements and cutting off the supply chain

Expensive: The sale of each Fonderie 47 piece funds the destruction of a specific number of assault rifles in Africa but they don't come cheap. Sheath Earrings (L) £18,000 and Ear Pendants earrings (R) £26,000

Thum and partner John Zapolski (along with LinkedIn billionaire Reid Hoffman as an investor) use these to make rings, necklaces, and other objects of art.

The James de Givenchy Phoenix Collection
was inspired by the concept of the egg as a symbol of budding 
possibility, fundamental beauty, and the potential for rebirth.

The sale of each Fonderie 47 piece funds the destruction of a specific number of assault rifles in Africa through NGO partnerships as well as programmes to support young people to build prosperity in conflict zones, from child soldiers to exceptional youth leaders in business, civic and academic pursuits. 

Helping hand: Fonderie 47 has destroyed more than 25,000 assault rifles in Africa

Destruction: Thum began purchasing confiscated AK-47s from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2010 to make jewelry from the parts

To date, Fonderie 47 has destroyed more than 25,000 assault rifles in Africa.

Unsurprisingly, the items don't come cheap. A steel, diamond, 18K rose gold and platinum ring that removes 160 assault rifles from circulation costs £31,000 while a bracelet will set you back £58,000.

But those lucky enough to be able to part with the money are assured in knowing that a pair of Fonderie 47 
cufflinks made from decommissioned guns, for example, are completely unique and 
can even be linked together into a one-off bracelet to give to a loved one.

‘These creations by James embody the purpose of Fonderie 47 by transforming the AK47, a relatively crude, mass-produced, industrial tool, into something fine. 

'They make this feel simple, and yet again not. 

'Each piece also challenges if not transforms preconceptions of worth and meaning, while tangibly funding the destruction of more guns in Africa upon purchase' said Peter Thum, CEO Fonderie 47.

James de Givenchy added: 'I believe that I was destined to make this collection for Fonderie 47.

Unique: If you're planning on shelling out over £150,000 on this necklace, you can be assured in knowing that it is totally unique

'With the Phoenix Collection I wanted to reinvent the way people view the AK47. With the egg form as its foundation, the Phoenix Collection is whimsical and optimistic.

'It embodies rebirth and thus is revolutionary in the proper sense of the word.

'I would like the wearer to feel all the different fates given to our human destiny and know how they are agents of the noblest of these.'
