Shocking dash-cam footage captures the terrifying moment a mother and four young children were pulled over by police at gunpoint.

The incident happened two weeks ago when cops in Forney, Texas were looking for a motorist who was waving a gun outside their window.

But they ended up pulling over the wrong car, frightening the four children under the age of 10 who thought they were going to jail.

Wrong mom: Kametra Barbour was driving her two children and two godchildren when she was pulled over by police in Forney, Texas for allegedly waiving a gun out the window. Police quickly realized they had confused her car with another. Above, dash-cam footage shows her 6-year-old son Ryan exiting the car

Mother Kametra Barbour was driving her two children and her two godchildren when she was pulled over.

According to local police, they had received a call from someone saying a driver was on the freeway waiving a gun out the window.

The car was described as a beige or tan-colored Toyota with four black males.

Barbour was driving a burgundy red Nissan Maxima at the time.

Different description: Police were looking for a beige or tan-colored Toyota at the time, but pulled over Barbour's red Nissan Maxima 

Abandoned: They then ordered Barbour out of the vehicle while the four terrified children were left alone in the car 

What's going on? Barbour followed the police officers' instructions, but continued to ask why she was being arrested 

Put your guns down: Barbour's 6-year-old son Ryan eventually gets out of the car and officers realize they have pulled over the wrong vehicle

Angered: Barbour says she's still upset about the incident

Police say they confused Barbour's car for the suspects' since she got off at the same exit the caller said the other car drove down.

So when she was pulled over the police were extremely defensive, and yelled out: 'Driver, let me see your hands! Everybody stick their hands out the window!'

Barbour listened to the police's instructions and walked out of her car, but she was confused and continued to ask why she was being arrested.

Police then told her that they got a complaint that a vehicle 'matching your description and your license plate' was waiving a gun.

Eventually Barbour's 6-year-old son gets out of the car with his hands raised and the officers lower their weapon, realizing the mistake.

The officers then walk up to the vehicle to reassure the children that everything is fine.

'Are we going to jail?' one of the children asks. 

'No. No one is going to jail,' an officer answers.   

'Hey, stop crying. It’s okay. It’s okay. Everything’s fine now,' an officer adds 

The police have defended their actions.

Detective Michael Clay says that police treated the situation properly because of the nature of the call and the fact that a weapon was involved.

But Barbour isn't as impressed with their apologies.

'I need you to make sure you have all the facts, because you can't just say, "Okay, I'm sorry," and then I'm over it. I can't. Every time I listen to and hear or think about it, it bothers you. I can't just say, 'I'm fine. It's okay. It's not a big deal.' It is," Barbour told WFAA. 

Officer: 'Put your hands on your head. Right here. Come on back.'

Barbour: 'What is wrong? My kids!'

Officer: 'How old are they?'

Barbour: 'They’re six and eight and ten, nine. What are we doing?'

Officer: 'Hold on a second, okay?'

Barbour: 'What is going on? Oh my God, you will terrify my children.'

Officer: 'We got a complaint of a vehicle matching your description and your license plate, waving a gun out the window.'

Officer 1: 'Do they look young to you?'

Officer 2: 'They do to me.'

Officer 1: 'Huh?'

Officer 2: 'They do to me.'

Officer 1: 'Yep, they’re young.'

Officer 1: [To other officers] 'Gun down, gun down, gun down.'

Officer 1: [As the child exits the vehicle] 'Come on back here, son. Come on back here, you’re alright.'

Officer: 'Y’all okay?'

Child: 'I’m scared.'

Officer: 'It’s okay.'

Child: 'Are we going to jail?'

Officer: 'No. No one is going to jail.'

Child: [Scream, crying]

Officer: 'Hey, stop crying. It’s okay. It’s okay. Everything’s fine now.
