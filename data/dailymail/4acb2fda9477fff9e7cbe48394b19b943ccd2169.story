It has been a World Cup rich in narrative – the heroes and villains jumping off the page - and on Sunday night one last act will be penned; it promises to be the captivating climax this tournament deserves.

A record one billion people will devote 90 minutes – or more – to a television relaying the drama as it unfolds in the Maracana; make sure you’re one of them.

For do not allow your memory of previous finals to erode enthusiasm ahead of this one.

Relief: Argentina celebrate their penalty-shootout victory over Holland in the semi-final

Destruction: Germany humiliated hosts Brazil 7-1 in their semi-final

In South Africa, four years ago, the most tedious tournament of recent times got the final it deserved, 120 minutes of boredom and brutality between Spain and Holland settled at the death by Andres Iniesta, it even robbed us of a penalty shootout.

This latest edition – thankfully – has been far removed from the depression of 2010. Even England’s early and entirely predictable exit has been forgotten amid the infectious, attacking spirit which has coursed through these finals.

Even the lesser contests – notably a handful of knockout matches – have hurtled to a conclusion in much the same manner as a playground battle with the bell about to sound. Think the closing stages of Argentina 1 Switzerland 0, Germany 2 Algeria 1 and Belgium 2 USA 1 and there you have football stripped of tactics but laced with tension.

There have been individuals - Colombia's James Rodriguez chief among them - underdogs - Costa Rica had bark and bite - upsets - Spain's demise and Brazil's capitulation the most shocking - goals - Robin van Persie's diving header this scribe's favourite - and a few baddies thrown in to darken the plot, he who now resides in Barcelona the most villainous of them all.

Germany and Argentina, though, have been the best two teams in Brazil and boast the protagonists to ink a fitting finale.

Lionel Messi, you suspect, has been keeping something back for this occasion, the genius which hauled his side through the group stage set to sparkle once more with the prize in sight.

While Javier Mascherano carries the water, Messi turns it to wine and they will need their messiah to be at his mesmeric best to toast victory in Rio; the stage, as they say, is set.

I(n the mood? Argentina will need Lionel Messi to be at his best if they're to triumph

Leg up: Five-goal Thomas Muller could prove the difference for Germany

Main men: Messi and Muller have been two of the best players on show in Brazil

The Bayern Wall: Manuel Neuer has been immense in goal for the Germans

Tackle of the tournament: Javier Mascherano denied Holland's Arjen Robben in the closing stages of the semi-final

But Germany are favourites for good reason. Their destruction of Brazil in the semi-finals made for a confusing cocktail of pain and pleasure as a viewer, but it left an undeniably moreish taste.

On Sunday, we will get more.  We will get more of the 'Bayern Wall', Manuel Neuer, more of his club-mates Bastian Schweinsteiger and Toni Kroos, the men who tease passes and torment opponents, and more of Thomas Muller, the player of whom it is said doesn’t have a trick or turn of pace yet has still been the best in Brazil.

That is the current vintage, factor in the history as well – this is their third final – and the stakes are heightened. It is 1-1 on finals won but Germany have proved Argentina’s nemesis in the last two tournaments, a 4-0 humiliation in South Africa sure to motivate Messi and Co. Indeed, as many as 18 of the players from Cape Town could feature on Sunday.

If revenge serves as added motivation then so be it, but you get the feeling the incentive this time is far more pure – to be crowned champion of the greatest World Cup in living memory, certainly of the colour-television age. We are set for one last illumination so be sure not to miss it.
