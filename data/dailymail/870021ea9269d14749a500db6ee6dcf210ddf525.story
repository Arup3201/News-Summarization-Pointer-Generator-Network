In the nineties the difference in the sexes was highlighted in the bestselling book Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus but has anything changed in the last two decades? 

In the modern era, are males and females becoming more aligned on issues from what's considered attractive to gender equality?

Not all the time, according to a new nationwide sex survey carried out by Men's Health and Women's Health magazines.

Different ideals: Women think Cameron Diaz has the perfect figure, left, while men prefer curvy Kate Upton

According to their poll of 1,000 men and 1,000 women, when it comes to having the perfect body, men and women think differently about what is sexy.  

While women are hell-bent on achieving the slim, boyish shape of Cameron Diaz it is the curvy figure of Kate Upton that men most desire. 

Meanwhile, while Hugh Jackman's beefy Wolverine look was the dream physique for men, more than half of women yearn for their man to look like Ryan Gosling.  

Mr muscle: Men aspire to look like Hugh Jackman but women prefer Ryan Gosling's look

According to Women's Health readers, the sexiest body part of a man is his chest, closely followed by his face and bottom. 

And they would rather their man had hairs on their chest with just 28 per cent thinking it was acceptable for men to shave it. This contrasts to 44 per cent of men who think shaving their chest is an acceptable grooming ritual along with moisturising (84 per cent) and tweezing their eyebrows (43 per cent).

These statistics led Men's Health Editor Toby Wiseman to comment: 'Understanding what women want is one of the great mysteries all men have confronted down the ages, and some of our female respondents' answers have been genuine eye-openers. 

'The good news is we can stand down on the preening – women are still in the market for someone distinctly masculine.' 

The sexes were in agreement over a hairstyle influencing their opinion of someone and 67 per cent of women and 63 per cent of men think tattoos are sexy.

Footing the bill: Eighty per cent of men think they should pay for dinner on a first date compared to 59 per cent of women

When it comes to our most secret desires, half of those British men surveyed would love a two-girl threesome, whereas a woman's favourite fantasy is light bondage (48 per cent). 

Both Men's Health and Women's Health readers also add spice to their love lives with some sexy role play.

Which of the following counts as cheating?

Which of the following grooming rituals are acceptable for a man?

Have had one to four one night stands

Men: 58%, women: 41%

Men should pay for dinner on a first date 

Men: 80%, women: 59%

Would be happy if their partner earned more than them?

Men: 81%, women: 91%  

Relationships in the modern era have become influenced by technology and social media - but men and women's opinions differ on what constitutes cheating which could cause some heartache.

A majority of 82 per cent of women think sexting is cheating while just 67 per cent of men feel the same way. Meanwhile nearly half of the women questioned think having a Tinder account is being unfaithful while only 37 per cent of men agree. 

When it comes to promiscuity, the genders are becoming more aligned with 58 per cent of men admitting to having one to four one night stands compared to 41 per cent of women.

Women's Health Editor Farrah Storr said of the findings: 'The notches on the bedpost might be equal but the gender revolution hasn't reached all corners of a relationship. 

'Our sex survey shows how certain attitudes of young men and women are increasingly aligned but when it comes to physical attraction, there's confusion over what attributes the opposite sex really desire most. We always have and always will want a real man.' 

When it comes to starting a family, the effect of the rising cost of living in the UK is the number one factor putting half of all men and 28 per cent of women off having a child. 

Loss of social life (18 per cent) and mess (11 per cent) are also contributing factors for men, but women worry about their career (23 per cent) and loss of figure (20 per cent).
