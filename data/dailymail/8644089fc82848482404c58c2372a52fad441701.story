These adorable mug shots show the lost teddy bears left on carriages and platforms that one train company are hoping to reunite with their owners.

First Great Western has launched the appeal in time for Christmas and allows people to look through a series of images to see if their toys have been found.

The firm are using mug shot type pictures, which show the cuddly bears and detail their height, weight, the date where they were found and at which station.

This Paddington bear was found abandoned at Reading station in October. The train company is wanting to reunite it with its owner 

Their website enables people to submit a search for a teddy, even if they are unable to remember exactly where it was lost.

The vast array of bears and dolls are now being stored in lost property offices across the south of England, with the bulk being held in a vault at Bristol Temple Meads station.

First Great Western, which covers the Thames Valley, Hampshire, Dorset, Sussex, Devon and Cornwall, is hoping to repatriate all the bears before Christmas.

This floppy eared bear was left inside a backpack, which was discovered at Reading station back in September 

These two lost bears were found at First Great Western stations in Truro and Penzance in Cornwall 

The vast array of toys and dolls are being held at First Great Western stations across the south of England, including this knitted elephant found in Slough 

It is thought the campaign has been inspired by release of the new Paddington Bear film later this month.

The movie, based on a series of books, tells the story of of a Peruvian bear, with a love of marmalade sandwiches, who is sent to England by his Aunt Lucy when she goes to live in a home for retired bears in Lima.

He is discovered by the Brown family at Paddington station and is taken in to live with them.

A spokesperson for the train company said: 'Unable to negotiate the gap unaided, these little bears and other cute cuddly toys have been separated from their families.

The new appeal is thought to have been inspired by the new Paddington Bear film, which is released later this month 

'Eventually, aided by our helpful and friendly staff, they have found their way to Lost Property in the vaults of Bristol Temple Meads Station.

'They have been fed, looked after and many adventures have been had. But now they are missing loved ones and want to return home.'
