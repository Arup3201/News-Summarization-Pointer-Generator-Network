Ralf-Werner Dehmer, 50, claimed he tripped over his dog and severed the digits on a circular saw. However insurers said what happened was no accident

 A German insurance agent who cut off his own finger and thumb to claim £1.2million in compensation has been found guilty of fraud after judges heard experts say what happened to him was no accident.

A court in Norderstedt, near Hamburg, gave Ralf-Werner Dehmer, 50, a 22-month suspended sentence when he was found guilty of trying to defraud his insurers.

Judges heard how Dehmer took out three seperate insurance policies - each one with a special clause covering hand and finger wounds - shortly before the 'accident' in February 2010.

He was rushed to hospital from his home that month with the thumb and forefinger of his left hand missing. 'I tripped over my two dogs and fell into a circular saw,' he said. But police and insurance company officials smelled a rat.

One report commissioned by an insurance fraud specialist said it was 'particularly astonishing' that the rest of his hand wasn't mangled.

'If I take out three insurance policies eight weeks before such a serious accident for such an irrational sum, something isn't right,' the prosecutor said.

'There's a lot of evidence against the accused. There was too little blood on the saw. An automatic car was ready to go. That number of coincidences can't be real.'

The missing digits from his hand were not found in a police search of his basement workshop - his wife said she 'found' them in the snow outside a week later.
