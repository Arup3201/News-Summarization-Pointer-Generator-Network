For 22 years, police searched for the identity of 'Baby Hope' - the 4-year-old girl sexually assaulted, murdered, then stuffed in a picnic cooler and tossed on the side of a road. In all that time, no one ever came to claim her. She was burned in a grave without a name, paid for by the detectives working her case.

But on Monday the girl's mother spoke, saying that she was 'devastated' to learn that her daughter Anjelica Castillo was Baby Hope. She told reporters that no one could understand her pain and that she only wanted justice for little Anjelica.

Margarita Castillo, however, would not say why she never reported her daughter missing or why no one from her family ever came forward during the high-profile search for Baby Hope's next-of-kin.

Margarita spoke out from her apartment in Elmhurst, Queens, for the first time since being identified by NYPD detectives as Baby Hope's mother.

She refused to open the door for reporters, but could be heard sobbing as she described learning that Baby Hope was her missing child.

'We are too emotional to talk right now because of everything we are going through. You wouldn’t understand my pain,' Margarita Castillo said.

'We are just waiting for justice. We are not going to have peace. You can't even describe a punishment.'

The mother of ten, who has children by three different men, is an illegal immigrant. Some neighbors say she didn't come forward because she feared deportation.

Others don't buy that explanation.

'Killer': Conrado Juarez being walked from the NYPD Cold Case Precinct in Brooklyn,  on Saturday. Juarez allegedly confessed to the rape and murder of the long-unidentified 'Baby Hope'

In custody: Juarez, 52, was arraigned on Saturday at Manhattan Criminal Court for the alleged murder of 4-year-old Anjelica Castillo, nicknamed 'Baby Hope', in New York

'I don't believe that. I don't believe that's true. They look like they are very aware. They're educated so I don't believe it,' neighbor Omar Delarosa told WABC-TV.

NYPD detectives arrested Conrado Juarez, 52, a cousin of Anjelica, this weekend after a break in the notorious cold case.

Juarez confessed to tying the girl to a table then sexually assaulting her and smothering her with a pillow when she wouldn't stop screaming.

The attack occurred at his sister's house in the Bronx. When his sister, who died years later, found out, she demanded that Juarez dispose of the body. 

He confessed to stuffing her in a blue cooler and dumping her along the Henry Hudson Parkway. She was found by construction workers on July 23, 1991.

A law enforcement official told NBC 4 
New York that Margarita Castillo claims Anjelica's father took her and several of her daughters to live with family members. He then returned to his native Mexico.

Margarita is said to claim she lived in fear of the baby's father 
and was afraid to go to police after her daughter disappeared.

It was not until she was reunited with all of her children years later that she realized Anjelica was gone, she says.
