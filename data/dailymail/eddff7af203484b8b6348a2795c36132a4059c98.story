Teenage girls are being manipulated and confused by role models who turn from clean-cut to raunchy, a leading headmistress warns.

Jo Heywood, who runs a £30,000-a-year girls’ boarding school,  singled out Miley Cyrus for her damaging ‘mixed messages’.

The singer, 20, became a child star in 2006 as the wholesome lead in the Disney series Hannah Montana.

Role model? Miley Cyrus as Hannah Montana in 2009, left, and performing with Robin Thicke at the MTV awards. Girls' school headmistress Jo Heywood says teenage girls are confused by role models who turn from clean-cut to raunchy

But in the past year, she has become embroiled in controversy, culminating in a provocative ‘twerking’  performance at the MTV Video Music Awards in August.

Miss Cyrus appeared in a skin-coloured bikini, danced suggestively with singer Robin Thicke and made lewd gestures with a foam finger.

Mrs Heywood, of Heathfield School in Ascot, Berkshire, said she hoped the success of athletes such as  Jessica Ennis and Victoria Pendleton at the London Olympics would give girls a new generation of women to admire.

Speaking out: Head teacher Jo Heywood singled out Miley Cyrus for her damaging 'mixed messages'

It had seemed that ‘finally women were being recognised for their achievements rather than their looks, which reality show they were on or which celebrity they were dating’, added Mrs Heywood.

‘As head of a girls’ school, I have long been yearning for more appropriate female role models for today’s young women,’ she continued.

‘We knew what these sportswomen stood for: hard work, sacrifice and achievement. They were clear-cut role models for young women.

‘A year on, I am not so sure that 
anything has really changed. I am more than a little concerned that some
 of the so-called role models young girls may look up to are giving them
 confusing, mixed messages.

‘Fast forward to another example of how young women are being manipulated and confused by potential role models.

‘Many
 young girls have grown up as fans of Hannah Montana. Hannah, played by 
petite and pretty Miley Cyrus, was the archetypal all-American teenager:
 a girl to look up to.

‘A 
few years later and we find Cyrus giving a headline-grabbing and 
controversial performance at the MTV Video Music Awards. Worryingly, 
Miley has apparently said she does not know what all the fuss is about.

‘However,
 there is plenty to be concerned about, especially when these once 
clean-cut role models steer another course so publicly.’

Writing on the Independent School 
Parent website, she also pinpointed Leah Totton, the 24-year-old doctor 
chosen by Sir Alan Sugar as the winner of the latest series of The 
Apprentice.

Praiseworthy: Mrs Heywood said she had hoped the success of athletes such as Jessica Ennis, left, and Victoria Pendleton, right, at the London Olympics would give girls a generation of women to admire

He is 
backing her in a venture launching a chain of cosmetic surgery clinics.

‘What message is this young woman projecting by her choice of business 
and what message is Lord Sugar giving by investing in this business?’ 
said Mrs Heywood.

‘Leah is a confusing role model. As a woman who has worked hard and excelled in her medical career and as a winner of The Apprentice, she has many admirable qualities and yet what she stands for and what she plans to do is far less admirable.’

Questions: Mrs Heywood asked what message Apprentice winner Leah Totton was sending to young women by launching cosmetic surgery clinics

Mrs Heywood said her school, which charges more than £30,000-a-year for pupils aged 11 to 18, was examining the ‘confusing’ way women are depicted in the media.

Yesterday, a teachers’ union leader joined the debate, criticising airbrushed images of stars for damaging the self-esteem of both male and female pupils.

Dr Mary Bousted said: ‘With the greatest ever proportion of women gaining degrees, and with girls outperforming boys in school at many levels, it’s disgraceful and damaging that the majority of women in magazines are airbrushed celebrities.’

The general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers added: ‘This bombardment of images demonises those who do not conform to the unrealistic and narrow depictions of the female body.

‘ATL members report that body image pressure not only impacts on female pupils but increasingly leads to low self-esteem, lack of confidence and anxiety in male pupils too.

‘With academic and social pressures, young people have enough to deal with.

'Comparing and competing not only with their peers on looks, but with airbrushed celebrities in the media, only leads to misery.’

Miss Cyrus has declared she paid no attention to negative reactions to her appearance at the MTV awards.

She has also had a spat with singer Sinead O’Connor and spoken publicly about her use of drugs.
