A minicab driver who claimed he was earning just £700 a month but was living a luxury of life in his Nigerian mansion, has been ordered to pay almost £1.2million.

Ovo Mayomi and his wife Juliet Ubiribo were convicted of fraud in 2010 after using an identity and immigration scam to falsely claim £43,000 in benefits.

Mayomi, 44, claimed he was earning £700 a month and was living in Croydon, south London, while his wife, 32, claimed benefits after telling benefit bosses she was a single mother and a victim of domestic violence.

£700 a month and living in Croydon, south London. His wife Juliet 
Ubiribo, 32, right, told benefit bosses she was a single mother and a victim of
 domestic violence

But fraud investigators found Mayomi 
and his wife were actually living in a large luxurious house in Lekki near the Nigerian city Lagos worth more than £1million 
complete with chandeliers and £89,000 worth of sound equipment. He also 
had a £25,000 watch. His wife wore a Rolex watch and drove a Mercedes 
Sport Coupi.

Now a judge has ordered Mayomi to pay £1,197,743.54 in a confiscation order under the Proceeds Of Crime Act, or go to prison for six years.

As well as two money-transferring 
businesses and bank accounts, investigators also discovered Mayomi owned
 a fish farm in the country.

The couple's benefit scam unravelled when a visa application by Mayomi showed they had married a year
 earlier and that Ubiribo had a job in order to support him.

Ubiribo also asked the council to rehouse her because she was the victim of domestic violence.

However,
 the telephone number she gave revealed the man she named as her 
landlord - Ayiomike Neburagho - was, in fact, her husband Mayomi using a
 false identity.

At a police interview, Mayomi 
admitted that while living in Nigeria he had bought the identity of 
Ayiomike Matthew Neburagho and had entered the UK as him.

Mayomi was also shown a wedding photograph of himself, using the Neburagho identity, marrying a Nigerian woman in the UK.

He admitted he was the groom in the wedding photo but he said he was 'just standing in for someone'.

Ubiribo and Mayomi pleaded guilty to all charges.

Mayomi was jailed for 30 months two years ago and his wife was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for two years.

She was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of community service and be under curfew for four months from 9pm to 6am.

Court orders were signed freezing 
their assets in the UK and abroad in 2010, and an investigation was 
launched to find out how much the Nigerian-born couple had gained from 
their criminal lifestyle and what the extent of their assets was.

Mayomi, of Ashburton, disputed the 
results of the assets investigation, and a subsequent four-day 
confiscation hearing took place at Croydon Crown Court.

Scam: Ubiribo stated she was a single parent to claim housing and council tax benefits to help her pay £900 in rent each month. A visa application by her husband 
showed Ubiribo had a job
 in order to support him

On Friday, Judge Nicholas Ainley 
ruled that Mayomi must pay £1,197,743.54 by 14 March next year. It is 
one of the largest confiscation orders carried out by a council. 

Failure
 to do so will see him sent to prison for six years, during which time 
interest will accumulate on his debt, which will remain due following 
his release.

At a hearing 
in July, a confiscation order was made against Ubiribo for £9,357.42 to 
be paid by 19 October or face five months in prison.

Investigators had discovered she was the owner of a Rolex watch and a Mercedes Sport Coupi.

Councillor Dudley Mead, deputy leader
 of the council, said: 'This is a landmark case for Croydon as it is the
 first time the council’s in-house financial investigator has pursued a 
major confiscation order of this nature.

'Usually
 these cases are dealt with by the police rather than local authorities.
 It is rare for councils to have their own in-house investigator, so it 
is to the anti-fraud team’s immense credit that it is pioneering the way
 forward in reclaiming the proceeds of crime.

'As
 a result of our investigator’s fine work, the council expects to be 
able to claw back as much as £400,000 in taxpayers’ money.

'This
 case should serve as a clear warning that crime does not pay. Croydon 
Council will always prosecute in fraud cases and seek to recover money 
or assets wherever they are.

'This is to protect decent taxpayers from having to pay more.'
