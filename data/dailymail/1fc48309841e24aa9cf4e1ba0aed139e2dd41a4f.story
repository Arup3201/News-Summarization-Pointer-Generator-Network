The happiest year of our life begins when we turn 34 because it's when we start ticking off boxes such as tying the knot, having children and making strides in a chosen career, according to a survey.

A study of 2,000 over-40s asked people to reflect on their levels of happiness through different stages of life and compiled the key factors for each decade.

Results showed age 34 was the happiest year for most people on average.

A study of 2,000 over-40s asked people to reflect on their levels of happiness through different stages of life and found 34 was the age when people were at their happiest in every aspect of their lives

The study also found it is the age when we are most comfortable in ourselves, earn enough money to get on the property ladder, meet monthly payments with confidence and start to enjoy the finer things in life.

Meanwhile, those who thought their 20s were the happiest cited the freedom, social life and career progression they enjoyed in that decade.

Those who chose a year in their 40s as their happiest enjoyed watching the children grow up and getting a bigger home, the study by home security specialists Yale found.

People who chose their 50s said work winding down, the children leaving home, paying off the mortgage and getting a new start after a divorce as their happy factors.

Getting on the property ladder was a recurring theme throughout the study and the age a person gets their first home often correlated with their happiest year

2. I had less responsibility/more freedom

3. I was comfortable with my appearance

4. I got married

6. All my money was spent on myself

7. I met someone I fell in love with

8. I had children

9. I had a wider social circle

10. I partied a lot

10. Finally got on the property ladder

11. I moved abroad

12. My family members got married

The study also found those choosing a year in their 60s as their happiest year so far said the ability to retire, travel more and finally relax as crucial boosts to a positive outlook.

A key reason behind being most happy included 'meeting someone I fell in love with' which appeared in the happy moments for 20s, 30s and 40s, while 'getting married' appears in every decade.

People were most likely to state that they had become happier as they had grown older rather than the other way round, results showed.

People cited having children and grandchildren as one of their 'happy factors' throughout each decade

Overall people reflected on their lives happily, with 47 per cent able to say most of their life had been happy so far.

And 43 per cent said their life had been an equal balance of happy and rougher times, while one in ten unfortunately looked back on their life as mostly unhappy.

Nigel Fisher, MD of home security Yale, said: 'With the average age we're most happiest coming out in the mid-thirties, it suggests that the feeling of being settled in your work and personal life while still looking to the future is important.   

'Getting on the property ladder was a recurring theme throughout the study and the age a person gets their first home often correlated with the happiest year they chose.

'That sense of a permanent home and place to create new and happy memories is a big part of the study and shows the importance of a secure home environment in making us content with life.'
