An Indiana police officer was found shot to death in his patrol car on Sunday on what coincidentally was the Operation Desert Storm veteran's 47th birthday.

The Lake County Sheriff's Office says it has taken three young men into custody in connection with the apparent murder of Gary police Officer Jeffrey Brady Westerfield, one of those men has been referred to by officers as 'a person of interest.'

Westerfield's body was found slumped in the driver's seat of his patrol car about 5:45 a.m. Sunday by a person driving near the intersection of Gary's 26th and Van Buren streets. The motorist noticed that the patrol car's lights were on as it sat parked on the side of the road.

Tragic: Gary Officer Jeffrey Westerfield, a father of four, was found fatally shot in his patrol car Sunday morning

Response: Authorities say Westerfield had responded to a call earlier in the morning that could be related to his death

Engaged: Westerfield and his fiancee, Denise Cather (pictured right), planned to get married in August

Police say the officer had responded to a call in the area, but wouldn't say what that call was related to.

'At this time we are not in a position to elaborate on that,' Gary Mayor Karen Freeman Wilson tells ABC 7.

However, Gary Police Chief Wade Ingram said at a morning news conference that Westerfield's death might be related to a call the officer answered earlier that morning.

'We don't think it was a traffic stop,' the chief said. 'It may have 
stemmed from something earlier... We do have several leads.'

Just hours later, at about 9 a.m., tactical teams as wells as state, local and federal law enforcement officials surrounded a house just a block-and-a-half from the intersection where Westerfield's body was found.

The entire area was shut down for nearly six hours, according to ABC 7. At 3 p.m., the tactical teams moved on the house alongside an armored vehicle.

When authorities emerged from the house, they had taken three of its occupants into custody. One of those arrested may have had a gunshot wound, but authorities say they were met with no resistance when they took the three men into custody.

'They're being taken into custody for interrogation,' said Lake County Sheriff John Buncich. 'More for you in a little bit.'

Westerfield was a beloved member of the community. He had served in the military during Operation Desert Storm and had three daughters. He had been a police officer for 19 years.

Westerfield's fiancee, Denise Cather, wants justice for the man she planned to marry less than two months from the day his body was discovered.

'I want the man or the kids or whoever it is…I want them caught,' Cather told WGN. 'I want them to look at me in the eye and tell me why they killed my fiance.'

Heartbroken: Cather says she and Westerfield had planned to go out to dinner for his birthday and then ride their motorcycles to a lake

The heartbroken fiancee went on to talk about Westerfield's big heart.

'My oldest daughter, he took her as his own, too. He took my
 grandchildren as his own. He was a fantastic man,' Cather said. 'He 
was wonderful he had a heart of gold. He’d help anybody -- 
all they had to do was call.'

The couple had known each other for 20 years and had been engaged for two. They planned to get married on August 24.

'We were in the middle of moving; we just bought a house,' Cather said.

She says they had planned to go out to dinner for his birthday and then ride their motorcycles to the lake.

'We’d 
go out there, have ice cream and look at the water,' she said.

Cather says she was informed of her fiance's death shortly after she got out of bed. She also says she never liked his job.

'Wake up, look out your window, and see six squad cars outside your 
house? You pretty much know what happened,' Cather said. 'That’s a way 
to wake up right?

'This is senseless...I just lost my best friend,' she continued.

Heart of gold:  Cather says Westerfield had a kind heart and would do anything for anyone

More details about the officer's death are expected to be revealed Monday.

This is the first time in six years that a law enforcement official had been killed in the line of duty in Gary, a once-booming steel town that is part of the Chicago metropolitan area. As industry began to move out of Gary, so did much of its population - the city's population has dropped 55-percent since its peak of about 178,000 people in 1960.

The town best known as the home of Michael Jackson and his musical family has been ravaged by crime in recent years, as industry continues to abandon the city.

According to a 2013 article by NWITimes.com, as of October 10, of that year, the city's homicide rate was 53 per capita (the rate per 100,000 residents). That equals one homicide for every 1,900 residents.

To put that into perspective, the website compares that to Hammond, Indiana, which has roughly the same size population as Gary. Hammond had a homicide rate of eight per capita.
