This is the dramatic moment a self-styled 'paedophile hunter' snared a pervert  by posing as a 14-year-old girl.

James Turner, 46, was caught after  writing sick messages to the youngster - who was actually Stinson Hunter pretending to be a schoolgirl - begging her for sex.

Footage of the moment Turner was caught was given to West Mercia Police and he was arrested.

Pervert: James Turner (pictured) was caught after writing sick messages to the youngster - who was actually Stinson Hunter pretending to be a schoolgirl

Turner, the managing director of a health supplement firm, now faces jail after he admitted attempting to incite a girl of 14 to engage in sexual activity at Worcester Crown Court.

Last year, Hunter featured in a controversial documentary which revealed how he trawled the internet posing as underage boys and girls in order to catch paedophiles.

In his latest sting he pretended to be young girl who caught the attention of Turner.

The court heard Turner never questioned the girl's age, even when she made it clear she was sexually inexperienced and told him 'I'm 14 so I'm guessing that will put you off'.

Shockingly, Turner continued to contact the girl and even pestered her to send him 'sexy' photographs of herself before arranging to meet for 'drink and lots of fun'.

In other messages, Turner, of Broomhall, Worcester, promised to be 'gentle' with her and talked about using contraception.

Last September, Hunter arranged to meet Turner at a hotel in Nuneaton, Warwickshire but when Turner arrived he was confronted by the self-styled 'paedophile hunter'.

Turner was bailed and ordered to return to court for sentencing on February 27. 

After Turner appeared at court on Wednesday January 28, Hunter, who has caught 18 paedophiles in the past two years, said: 'This guy confirms and proves that what I'm doing is right.

'If people are talking about me then they're talking about an issue.

'[Turner] is a prime example of a guy that I would suggest is from a nice background.

'That's an example of who these people are, it's not just your stereotypical greasy, dirty paedophile.

'His attitude was disgusting - at one point he laughed.

'I just want the whole world to realise that this is an issue and the Government are ignoring it.

'It's not to get people locked up, it's to get people talking, to raise awareness and hopefully get people to look at a serious issue.

'I want to get into schools, talk to parents and kids and work with them about online safety.

'I want to reach both parents and kids and hopefully change something.'

Smug: '[Turner] is a prime example of a guy that I would suggest is from a nice background. That's an example of who these people are, it's not just your stereotypical greasy, dirty paedophile'

Hunter, who is based in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, works with his team to entrap internet perverts - including soldiers, teachers and solicitors. They track down suspects through the internet and dating apps.    

The vigilantes usually pose as boys or girls in their early teens. Once they are sent explicit messages and videos by the men, the team lure them to  meet up.

There, they are filmed with handheld cameras and mobile phones and told to explain themselves. The messages and footage are then handed to police. 

Hunter's methods came under fire last year after one man he confronted, 45-year-old Michael Parkes, took his own life.

He hanged himself after being questioned by police after he was confronted by  Hunter, and footage of the encounter was uploaded to the internet.

Police later said they would have sought to charge Mr Parkes in connection with the incident, in which he arranged to meet someone he thought was a 12-year-old girl.

Mr Parkes’ partner, who was also interviewed for the Channel 4 documentary, said she 'may agree' with the vigilante going online to gather evidence, but said publishing the videos was 'what probably tipped him over the edge'.
