Wearing natural make-up and her hair in its trademark beachy curls, Rosie gives us a lesson in summer style.

Rosie's made no secret of her love of all things green and it seems that it helped her on the way to the glowing skin and svelte physique she parades in the new campaign.

Speaking about her love of green juices, she told the Irish Independent: 'I make one every morning and try to have them in hotels.

'I put in quite a few sprigs of kale and spinach, apples and celery - anything green. You put in the right amount of everything and it's delicious.'

She also works out with James Duigan, the man behind the hugely successful Clean & Lean empire.

Rosie met James several years ago and is such a fan that she penned the 
introduction to his book Clean & Lean: Flat Tummy Fast.

Rosie said: 'James knows exactly how I want my body to look: lean, taut and strong, yet soft, curvy and feminine.

'What
 I've learned through working with James is that by focusing on creating
 a healthy body you can really achieve all of these things, faster than I
 ever thought possible. Oh, and by the way, nobody can get a stomach as 
flat as James can!'

Wise words: Sharing her life advice in a recent interview, the Devon-born beauty said: 'Keep your wits about you. Be smart. Say no if something makes you feel uncomfortable. Have goals and go after them, and practice good manners'

Aside from her modelling duties, Rosie has been spending a lot of time with long-term boyfriend Jason 
Statham.

Proving that they are stronger than ever, the lovebirds stepped out for a
 romantic dinner on Sunday evening.

Rosie,
 27, of course looked incredible for the occasion wearing a stunning 
floral maxi dress which no doubt made her 46-year-old man swoon.

The in-demand model recently covered the June issue of Violet Grey,
in which she opened up about her idol. 'I love Elizabeth Taylor. She 
always strikes me as the ultimate femme fatale,' she gushed.

Super smoothie: The model often uploads snaps of
 herself slurping on smoothies and juices, which she describes as 'the 
perfect way to start the day

'Keep your
 wits about you. Be smart. Say no if something makes you feel 
uncomfortable. Have goals and go after them, and practice good manners.'

And
 though she has a thriving career and is perhaps considered one of the 
world's most beautiful women, she admitted she is not always feeling 
quite so on top of the world.

When
 asked if she is happy, she said: 'Mostly, yes. I do believe to be happy
 you have to work on yourself. You have to listen to yourself and stay 
true to your heart.'

 Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who has one of showbiz's most enviable figures, recently praised her ‘delicious green juice' which she described as 'a 
great way to start the day.'

But what’s behind this mysterious 
concoction? Along with other super healthy ingredients such as cucumber,
 kale and parsley, the Japanese wholefood Chlorella is added to the 
juice.

And it’s not just Rosie 
who’s caught the Chlorella bug, Miranda 
Kerr has admitted that she takes Chlorella supplements to keep her skin 
in check.

green vegetable smoothie

Nadia Brydon, who’s a 
nutritionist and green food expert at Sun Chlorella, has shared her tips
 for the perfect morning smoothie....

'With
 everyone from Rosie Huntington-Whiteley to Millie Mackintosh drinking 
green smoothies recently, you’d be forgiven for thinking this is just 
another beauty fad.

'We
 all know that we’re probably not eating enough greens, yet our greens 
contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat, and are the 
most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help 
keep us healthy. 

Green
 smoothies can be high in vitamin B12, which can help reduce tiredness, 
and magnesium, which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as 
nature’s tranquiliser, helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so 
it’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it! 

You’ll
 notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their 
juices, to up their nutrient intake even further. For instance, a daily 
serving of the Japanese wholefood Sun Chlorella contains iron content 
equivalent to nine cups of spinach (270g) and the same B12 content as a 
32oz steak.

Perhaps 
most importantly, these drinks provide large quantities of whole food 
natural vitamins and minerals and help increase our daily intake of 
fruit and vegetables – for busy people who still want to remain healthy,
 this is hugely important.

Smoothies
 are also full of fibre and water along with a whole range of nutrients 
which naturally makes us feel fuller which reduces the desire to consume
 food generally especially sugar and carbohydrates. We recommend the 
Rolls Royce of blenders, the Vitamix blender, as it breaks down the cell
 walls of fresh, whole foods to deliver the full benefit of nutrients. 
It also saves time as all of the ingredients can be added at once.'

Miranda
 and Rosie’s green juices and smoothies are so nutritious, simply 
because greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we 
eat, and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily 
basis to help keep us healthy. 

Combining
 these into an easy to drink smoothie can help busy people cram as many 
of these vegetables into their daily diet as possible. Juicing and 
blending raw green vegetables and living micro greens (sprouts) 
containing fresh vibrant green chlorophyll are extremely nutritious ways
 of creating optimum health and energy.

Just juice: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has revealed that she loves Chlorella (like those pictured right) green juices

Juicing
 or blending any raw green vegetable, especially the living leafy 
varieties, is an effective way of increasing oxygen in the body and 
helping to build healthy tissues. Oxygen maintains life and is a 
rejuvenator of all body systems.

Green
 smoothies containing the ingredients seen in Rosie and Miranda’s can be
 high in vitamin B12, which can help reduce tiredness.

The
 spinach in Rosie’s signature smoothie is high in magnesium, which is 
found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature’s tranquiliser, 
helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it’s no wonder so many 
busy celebs are trying it! 

You’ll
 notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their 
juices, to up their nutrient intake even further. For instance, a daily 
serving of the Japanese wholefood Sun Chlorella contains iron content 
equivalent to nine cups of spinach (270g) and the same B12 content as a 
32oz steak – vitamin D in particular is important for winter, as this 
nutrient is produced by natural sunlight, and long cold winters can 
cause Brits to become deficient, meaning it’s important to top up where 
possible.   To make a Rosie or Miranda style green 
smoothie, try the delicious recipe below at home. Freshly juiced fruits 
should always be diluted 50:50 with water in order to dilute the sugar 
content.  Blend the below ingredients, adding the water first.•    600ml mineral water (still) •    ½ chopped cucumber (skin & pips included) •    ¼ peeled avocado •    1 chopped celery stick •    Juice of ½ lemon or lime •    ¼ teaspoon unrefined salt •   
 Sun Chlorella ‘A’ tablets: initially starting off with 5 tablets for 
the first three days, moving up to 10 for the next 3 days and then 15 
tablets herein after. •    Small double handful (60-80mg) of mixed 
green leaves from the following (they can be combined): spinach, 
watercress, rocket, savoy cabbage, chard, lettuce, chicory, kale, bok 
choy, sprigs of mint, parsley, coriander, basil.
