Soaring high above the Earth, this thrillseeker has a unique perspective on the planet below.

Travelling in a glider, Jan Thinoks, from Lyon, France, captures stunning footage as he flies over the Vercours Massiff - a mountain range in east of the Rhone Valley.

The video shows Thinoks taking to the sky in a number of different gliders, solo and with co-pilots.

With the sun reflecting off the diverse landscape, views from the glider are incredible

He flies dangerously close to rock-faces, taking in greenery and snow depending on the day.

With a large section of the plane made of perspex or glass, views from the cockpit are stunning and spectacular. 

Gliding is a skill that sees the pilot measure conditions of the day, such as wind strength and direction, and then direct the plane - which has no engine and only propellers.

It's essential that all checks are carried out ahead of the glider getting airborne

Thinoks allows family and friends to enjoy his gliding adventure

It's definitely a thumbs up for the terrific views high above the Vercours in France

It is key to use 'lift' to continue your journey - this is taking advantage of invisible currents of air that can help to take your speed to around 100mph.

Mr Massiff clearly enjoys the ride - spinning his glider upside down, and giving the camera the 'thumbs up' while overlooking incredible views.

This is one for the strong of stomach as the pilot is pictured upside down

The pilot comes very close to the rock faces as he wants to take in all the surroundings

The snow-covered mountains are a spectacular sight that stretch for miles
