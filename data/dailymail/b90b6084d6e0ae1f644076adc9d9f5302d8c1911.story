She has grown to be something of a national treasure since becoming a judge on the Great British Bake Off.

But Mary Berry, who has no problem whipping up a Victoria Sponge, has managed to upset Yotam Ottolenghi over her hummus recipe.

The Israeli cook, who is famed for transforming vegetarian cooking in the UK, was outraged that the baking star added olive oil to the dish – and leaves out the tahini.

Yotam Ottolenghi said he was 'upset' that Mary Berry added olive oil to hummus recipe and leaves out tahini

During his appearance at the Cheltenham Literature Festival in Gloucestershire he said: ‘Hummus cannot have anything but chickpeas, soaked overnight and never from a tin, lemon juice and tahini and water and a little bit of garlic.

‘Some people put olive oil in their hummus, or other oil, which is a big no no.

'That makes me really upset.' 

But after watching the 79-year-old preparing her version of hummus on television he was left fuming.

He added: ‘I love Mary Berry but I saw her make hummus in one of her shows without tahini and it had chickpeas crushed with olive oil.’

The renowned restaurant owner reportedly put his head in his hands as he became frustrated at the thought.

Mary Berry says you could also add chopped coriander leaves and a pinch of cumin to hummus

He was further infuriated to learn that she uses tinned chickpeas, among other non-traditional ingredients.

Her recipe recommends adding chopped coriander leaves, a pinch of ground cumin and three tablespoons of Greek yoghurt.

She also says that tahini – a thick paste made from ground sesame seeds – can be used if you like the ‘traditional sesame seed flavour of hummus’.

And Berry is not alone in the oil debate – Delia Smith adds olive oil to her hummus and Nigella Lawson prefers garlic oil.

While Heston Blumenthal further waded into the debate, saying he would even consider leaving out the lemon juice.

‘I use one third olive oil and two thirds groundnut oil,’ he told the Times.

‘The oil brings richness. You have got to put in salt and you need acidity, lemon juice or vinegar. Without that it would all be wrong.’

But Ottolenghi, who maintains olive oil is fine as long it is drizzled on top of the dish, said the dispute is far more heated in Jerusalem.

One of the chapters in his books entitled Hummus wars explains the so-called ‘hummusia fetish’.

He says there is evidence in scriptures that Jews ate it in biblical times but that ‘nobody seriously challenges the Palestinian hegemony in making hummus, even though both they and the Jews like calling it their own’.

The dip has become so popular among Brits that a survey last year revealed that 41 per cent of people had a pot in the fridge.

And we reportedly get through 12,000 tonnes a year with sales at Waitrose growing by 40 per cent annually.
