Allen and Company's Sun Valley Conference is called the 'summer camp for billionaires' and it lives up to the name. All manner of wizened political and business leaders are attending this year's event.

Rupert Murdoch, the 82-year-old chairman and CEO of News Corp, has been pictured with both of his sons. Also in attendance are Berkshire Hathaway founder Warren Buffett, also 82 and ranked as the fourth richest man in the world; New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, 71; and Phil Knight, the 72-year-old founder of Nike.

But it's the young, hip - and significantly dressed-down - tech executives who have become the center of attention at the Idaho mountain resort this week.

Nothing to prove: Ben Silbermann, left, the CEO and co-founder of Pinterest, and David Ebersman, CFO of Facebook, didn't seem too worried about their appearance at Sun Valley resort in Idaho on Tuesday

The new cohort of Silicon Valley power brokers is led by Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, 29, and his wife Priscilla Chan. Other notable figures include Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, 36, Pinterest founder Ben Silbermann, 30, and YouTube CEO Salar Kamangar, 35.Â 

These new 'masters of the universe' seem to have a few things in common. They're coders by trade. They made their careers by writing computer programs and working on the technical side of Silicon Valley. They're all insanely rich. Zuckerberg has a $13.1billion fortune. Dorsey is worth $1.1billion. Kamangar was the sixth employee every hired at Google.

And none of them seem to dress the part. Highly powerful and super rich - they prefer unassuming t-shirts and jeans to a suit and tie. Billions of dollars in wealth and hardly a collar in sight.

Zuckerberg has famously led the way in this trend with his insistence on wearing a hooded sweatshirt - even to some powerful business meetings.

He did not deviate from his fashion trend at Sun Valley, either. While his new wife Priscilla Chan looked lovely in a white blouse and scarf, Zuckerberg sported a black hoodie and jeans.

Selbermann - whose Pinterest social networking site has nearly 50million users and was valued at $1.5billion last year - was pictured in an ill-fitting grey t-shirt.

Power player: Salar Kamangar, the 35-year-old CEO of YouTube, is said to be in high demand for the website's content delivery capabilities. He's seen here with his boss, Google chairman Eric Schmidt

He was seen next to David Eversman, the Chief Financial Officer of social networking rival Facebook. Eversman, a 44-year-old Brown University graduate, who was wearing a blue and white-striped polo shirt.

Dorsey, the founder of Twitter, seemed to be going for a hipster look. He was seen with on-again-off-again girlfriend Kate Greer wearing a leather jacket, cowboy boots and a simple t-shirt tucked into his jeans.

Despite their geeky appearances, these tech gurus have become some of Sun Valley's most powerful voices.

TheWrap, a Hollywood news site, reports that the heads of major content producing companies like Murdoch, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes and Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai are lining up to speak with the young tech executives.

These old-media power players see Zuckerberg and social media leaders as the best way to market their movies and television shows in a world where more and more young people are getting their entertainment online.

Other executives like YouTube's Kamangar and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, 52, are also in demands because they control the delivery methods for content. Tens of millions of users stream movies and shows online through Netflix and YouTube.

Those companies, though, need to hammer out agreements with the content producers in order for their businesses to grow.

Sun Valley, afterall, was founded as place where the world's most powerful men and women could gather to rub elbows - and hammer out major business deals.
