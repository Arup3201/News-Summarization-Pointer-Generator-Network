Abuse: Sidney's biological father claimed that Cornell had abused Sidney, saying that he 'slugged her in the mouth'

As the search for the teenager continues, her biological father claimed that Cornell had abused Sidney, saying that he 'slugged her in the mouth'.

Victor Randall told KAIT-TV: 'She was scared of him.' He also said that his daughter 'was going to tell' of Cornell's alleged behaviour.

Describing Sidney as a 'sweet, caring person', her brother Ben said she was also 'keeping something'.

He added: 'She never did tell anybody but she was keeping something from everybody.'

Suspect: John Cornell, who was named as the main suspect in her disappearance, was found 200 yards from his truck having died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound

Sidney was last seen at her home in Walnut Ridge, Arkansas, on Saturday March 4 at 10pm wearing a brown Aeropostale jacket.

Her mother Denise Cornell woke at 3:30am but could not find her daughter or husband Cornell in the property.

When Cornell returned home without Sidney, Mrs Cornell called 911, before her husband once again left the house.

His body was found on Monday, having died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, approximately 200 yards from his truck. 

Lawrence County Sheriff Jody Dotson said that Cornell had gone on a spending spree after collecting his tax return.

He purchased a computer, the gun that inflicted the fatal wound and a number of smaller items.

Mrs Cornell told KAIT-TV she believes her daughter was forced from the house, pointing to the fact that she left her makeup behind.

She added: 'She has an upcoming pageant in 
April, and that’s how I know she wouldn't have left willingly.'

An extensive police search has yet to find locate Sidney, described as 5'04" with green eyes and brown hair, having deployed helicopters, sniffer dogs and scuba divers.

A team of volunteers has renewed their search for the beauty queen, focussing on northeastern Arkansas.
