One British holidaymaker is arrested every two hours as they travel abroad in search of cheap drink and sun.

More than 5,400 were detained by police overseas last year, including 653 held in connection with drug offences.

Ministers issued a stark warning to Brits that they risk ‘throwing years of your life away in a foreign prison’ as they released a map of the parts of the world where Brits are most likely to get into trouble.

Trouble: Alcohol was a 'major factor' in emergency cases involving young people visiting Ibiza, Turkey and Greek islands, the Foreign Office said. Brits are pictured on the Punta Ballena strip, the notorious bar and club area of Magaluf on the Spanish island of Mallorca

Too many people fail to respect ‘local laws and customs’ when jetting off to countries like India and United Arab Emirates, the Foreign Office warned.

Serious punishments can be handed down for offences that seem ‘trivial’ back home.

Alcohol continues to be a ‘major factor’ in cases involving young people visiting the Balearics, Turkey and Greek islands.

More than 19,200 Brits abroad needed emergency help from embassies around the world  in 2012-13, new figures show.

It included 3,600 who ended up in hospital, with a sharp increase in Thailand blamed on young tourists having accidents on mopeds.

There were also dramatic rises in the number of Brits raped or sexually assaulted in some of the most popular resorts, including Spain, Portugal and Cyprus.

Travellers were urged to take precautions to avoid being attacked, including avoiding lifts from strangers or leaving drinks attended which could be spiked.

Danger: The number of people hospitalised in Thailand rose 31 per cent, with officials warning many were caused by young Brits riding mopeds without helmets

The three countries in which the largest number of sex attacks reported were Spain, Turkey and Greece – ‘destinations popular with young Brits for their busy nightlife’, the Foreign Office said.

As British holidaymakers travelled further afield, embassies in India, United Arab Emirates and the Philippines saw increases in serious cases including arrests and hospitalisations.

Thailand saw a 31 per cent increase in both hospitalisations and deaths, despite falls worldwide.

The increase was in part blamed on a rise in road accidents involving young people on mopeds after the number of people admitted to hospital hit 285.

Bikers were warned that they should always wear a helmet and most insurers will not pay out for treatment if they have been drinking alcohol.

In 2012-13 there were 5,435 British citizens arrested overseas, down around 10 per cent on a year earlier.

But the number of arrests was up in United Arab Emirates, Canada, Netherlands and New Zealand, and there was an increase in drug-related arrests in USA, Greece, Portugal and China.

The Foreign Office issued a blunt warning to anyone planning to holiday abroad this summer:  ‘Don’t take risks with the law abroad – or you could end up throwing years of your life away in a foreign prison.

‘Think about what you are doing at all times and trust your instincts – do not take risks that you would not at home.

‘Many countries have a zero-tolerance approach to offences involving drugs and alcohol and sentences can be long.

‘It is a good idea to research the local laws and customs of the country you are visiting - there may be serious penalties for breaking a law that might seem trivial at home.’

A total of 6,193 Brits died abroad last year, down around 100 in 2011-12.

Most were ex-pats and holidaymakers in Spain, followed by France and Germany.

Overall 28,783 people’s passports were lost or stolen, the highest number since 2008.

Foreign office minister Mark Simmonds said: ‘I encourage all British travellers to do everything they can to ensure a safe and enjoyable trip by taking some basic steps to prepare themselves before departure, including taking out comprehensive travel insurance and researching their destination.’
