An Olympic hopeful who had to give up her sporting dreams after breaking her neck has managed to walk down the aisle, and had a baby, thanks to her unflagging determination and the devoted care of her fiancé.

Natalie Burr, 30, from Maidstone, Kent landed on her head while trampolining, leaving her paralysed and unable to walk or use her arms.

But with the unwavering support of her fireman fiancé, Shane, 35, she went on to walk down the aisle and give birth to baby Holly, now one.

With Shane's encouragement and intense physiotherapy, in 2009 Natalie walked down the aisle with her father

Natalie had been trampolining since she was four years old, and dreamed of making it to the Olympics.

But in 2007, she was training for the World Championships when she fell during a move. 'I knew I'd broken my neck - I heard it crack,' Natalie says. 'I couldn't move or feel anything. I was terrified.'

Natalie's day job as an ambulance 
technician meant she knew staying still was crucial, so she asked a 
bystander to call her fiancé, Shane.

'I remember saying to him: "I've broken my neck. You're going to leave me",' she says.

'He promised he wouldn't, but I was in 
complete shock.' In hospital, doctors discovered Natalie had broken most
of the bones in her neck, and she was put on life support.

A week later, a metal plate and bone 
from her hip were inserted into her neck. While she was still on life 
support, Shane was told the devastating news that she'd never walk 
again.

'I couldn't believe it,' Shane says. 

'I remember wondering how I'd break it 
to Natalie when she woke up. I didn't want her to lose hope - I had to 
be strong for her.'

Natalie stayed on life support for two months, Shane visiting every day.

'Not being there wasn't an option,' he says. Despite doctors warnings that Natalie would be paralysed for life, with Shane's support she was determined to defy the odds.

'I remember my knee moving slightly,' Natalie says. 'I showed Shane and we were really excited.'

After just a month in rehab, Natalie defied doctors by taking her first tentative steps. Looking forward to finally putting the accident behind her, she left hospital and returned to work in a desk role.

But the couple's challenges weren't over.

A year later she was struck down with meningitis, caused by the metal plate in her neck. Surgery meant Natalie was unable to eat for six months, during which time Shane fed her through a tube.

Her vocal chords were also damaged so Shane - travelling 140 miles a day to visit in between working as a fireman - could only understand her by lip reading.

'She was the same Natalie underneath, even if she couldn't express herself,' he says.

When Natalie finally recovered, the couple began to discuss getting married. 'I was still confined to a wheelchair, but determined to walk down the aisle,' Natalie says.

With Shane's encouragement and regular physiotherapy, in May 2009 Natalie walked down the aisle with the help of her father.

'We even managed a first dance, Shane holding me up as we swept around the floor to Take That,' she says. 'It felt like a dream.'

The icing on the cake for the couple came in August 2012, when Natalie gave birth to daughter Holly.

To help Natalie adjust to motherhood, Shane adapted a buggy to fit Natalie's wheelchair. 'It was incredible to know we'd made it and were a family, after everything we'd been through,' she says.

Today, Natalie - pictured pregnant with Holly - is back coaching trampolining, having defied doctors' predictions

Today, Natalie is back coaching trampolining, having beaten insurmountable odds thanks to the love and support Shane has given her.

'It's not easy, but I've confronted my fear,' she says. 'Nothing scares me anymore.'

Natalie's sister, Kirsten MacDonald, says: 'Natalie and Shane have always been close, but Natalie's accident made Shane realise exactly how important they were to each other.

'They make a great couple - one's weakness is the other's strength. There wasn't a dry eye on their wedding day.'

Natalie and Shane have been shortlisted for the Love Story category of The Cosmopolitan Ultimate Women of the Year Awards  2013 with Vauxhall Adam
