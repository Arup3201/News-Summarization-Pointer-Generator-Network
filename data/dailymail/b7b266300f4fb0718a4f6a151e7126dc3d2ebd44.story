A YouTube prank video uploader has taken a more serious turn with his latest video, lending a camera to a homeless friend so that he could document a few days in his life.

From studying computer science to sleeping under a bridge, Sandy Shook has seen and done a lot of things in his life.

The homeless Austin, Texas, man claims to have spiralled into homelessness after developing anger problems, while following a religious group several decades ago.

Quiet Assassins YouTube channel creator Joseph Costello first came across Mr Shook while filming some segments for his popular YouTube channel.

The two hit it off, and Mr Shock asked if he could borrow a video camera to record some time in his own life.

‘Really exciting, huh - the life of the homeless,’ he says.

Filming his own pieces to camera, Mr Shook shows audiences how he sleeps rough at night.

Mr Shook holds a religious group responsible for his situation, claiming he developed anger issues as a result of becoming entangled in the church.

He explains: ‘So here I am, an old homeless man. Not because I’m an alcoholic, not because I’m a narcotics user, not because I’ve ever had a substance abuse problem - but because I joined a church.’

The computer science graduate even films through the night as he wakes up due to cold

‘Things like that shouldn’t happen,’ he adds.

‘It was one of those mind control groups that nobody gets out until you’re completely crazy.’
