The estranged wife of George Zimmerman faced news cameras with her lawyer on Wednesday to insist that she thought her husband had a gun when she called 911 during a domestic dispute on Monday.

Shellie Zimmerman's lawyer also explained that she isn't pressing charges because she just wants to get a divorce and move on.

'Shellie Zimmerman wants this relationship to end with a whimper and not a bang,' Orlando attorney Kelly Sims said.

Shellie stood quietly by her attorney's side for the 40-minute news conference. She did not speak at the request of Sims.

Shellie Zimmerman's lawyer also explained that she isn't pressing charges because she just wants to get a divorce and move on.

The news conference was held as MailOnline reported that George Zimmerman has been accused of cheating on his wife a second time since his acquittal for the murder of Trayvon Martin.

The first woman was his ex-fiancée. The second woman, Samantha Scheibe, was by his side on Monday afternoon at the Zimmermans' marital home when Shellie confronted her husband over his serial infidelity as they split their belongings days after she filed for divorce.

At the end of her 911 call she can be heard shouting: 'There's a woman in there!'

A source close to the couple told MailOnline: ‘George took off after the acquittal and struck up an affair with his ex-fiancée but now he’s got a new girlfriend, a blonde woman who was there that afternoon. He brought her back to Shellie’s father’s place.

‘She was there at the domestic [dispute]. The audacity of the guy is unbelievable. None of his friends know where his head is.’

MailOnline revealed earlier this week that Zimmerman had an affair with former fiancee Veronica Zuazo, 31, sometime after his acquittal in July.

Injuries: David Dean, Shellie Zimmerman's father, sustained a cut nose in the altercation

The existence of a second lover emerged on the day that police revealed it could be months before Shellie and her husband learn if either of them will face charges in relation to the altercation.

Surveillance footage taken outside the home - which the couple previously shared - shows George Zimmerman holding an iPad as he is approached by police. He then throws it to the ground.

Officers believe it contains vital evidence and have handed it to experts to see what can be retrieved - causing the delay.

In the hours following the dispute which, according to Lake Mary Police Department Officer Zach Hudson, rapidly deteriorated into a ‘typical “he said, she said” domestic’ conflicting versions emerged.

The police report reveals that when Shellie had arrived to pick up her belongings, he started taking pictures, so Shellie started recording on the iPad. The meeting quickly escalated when Zimmerman stuck his hand in her father's truck, the report said. Shellie heard her father, David Dean, yelling and then found her 'father's glasses on the floor and a red mark on his nose'.

It states Zimmerman then took her iPad and she felt 'shocked, powerless and shaken' when Zimmerman smashed the iPAd and used a knife to pry it open before throwing it on the ground.

It went on: '(Zimmerman) reached his hand into his shirt to what she assumed was a gun when (Zimmerman) said to her father, "step closer".' The police were called and Mr Dean then said to Zimmerman: 'What are you going to do, shoot me?'.

Shellie’s initial panic-stricken 911 call also suggested that her estranged husband was threatening her and her father with a gun.

Pictures have also emerged of Mr Dean with a cut nose. Shellie claimed in her 911 call that Zimmerman had punched him. However, Mr Dean has said he doesn't want to bring charges.

In retaliation, Zimmerman has claimed that Shellie was the aggressor and she too could face charges.

He claims in the police report that he was being hit with the iPad, so he snatched it away.

The heated fight began after Shellie 
and her father went to collect her belongings from the house on Monday, 
just days after she filed for divorce, claiming the six-year marriage 
was 'irretrievably broken'.

On
Tuesday, a new video revealed the dramatic moment police swarmed 
Zimmerman's car and ordered him to get down on his knees before taking 
him into custody after the altercation.

When police arrived on the scene of the argument, which had allegedly turned violent, Zimmerman was in the driver's seat of his car.

Police ordered him out of his car and shouted for him to raise his hands, turn around and walk backwards toward them.

By the time he appeared to be about 20 feet away, police shouted 'Get on your knees! Lock your feet!'

Zimmerman dropped to his knees and two officers approached, one with his gun drawn, while the other handcuffed him. 

Then several other officers ran toward the house where the dispute allegedly took place. The video was first reported by TMZ.

The video, recorded by a police cruiser's dash cam, surfaced as his lawyer revealed he would no longer represent him, despite the possibility that Zimmerman could face charges in the dispute.

Mark O'Mara, who represented Zimmerman 
when he was acquitted of murder in the death of Trayvon Martin, made his
shock announcement that he would be leaving his client on Tuesday.

O'Mara
said that his client did nothing wrong on Monday afternoon but added that he was no longer going
to represent Zimmerman due to their impending divorce.

'I've come to know them as a family, and it's not a good idea to get in between them,' O'Mara said.

O'Mara will continue to be Zimmerman's
lawyer in a defamation suit pending against NBC and in the remaining 
motions from the Trayvon Martin trial.

ABC
News reported that O'Mara appeared to struggle with his anger at his 
client during Monday's incident when he arrived at the home.

During a press conference, O'Mara was asked if he had any advice for Zimmerman, and he responded: 'Pay me.'

The
encounter on Monday was the latest in a string of events for Zimmerman.

He
has twice been pulled over on suspicion of speeding and ticketed once. 
He also appeared in photos at a gun maker that were published online and
he helped members of a family from their vehicle following a car wreck.

He has also been involved with a domestic case at least once before.

In 2005, Zimmerman's former fiancee filed for a restraining order 
against Zimmerman, alleging domestic violence. Zimmerman responded by 
requesting a restraining order against his then-fiancee.

In
an interview with ABC's Good Morning America that aired last Friday, 
Shellie Zimmerman said her 29-year-old husband
is reckless and feels invincible.
