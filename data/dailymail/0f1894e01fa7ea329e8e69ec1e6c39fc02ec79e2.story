A German man went down an unusual route to ask his girlfriend to marry him, by having his proposal photographed by a speed camera. 

Christian Breier, 31, held up a sign reading 'Will you marry me?' as he sped past a police camera near his home in Leipzig.

German police send offenders photographs of offending drivers with a speeding notice to their homes, so Mr Breier's girlfriend found the proposal in the post.

Drive-thru proposal: Christian Breier, 31, from Leipzig, proposed to his partner Anja, 29, by getting caught speeding by a police camera

Mr Breier's says he had broached the subject of marriage with his partner Anja, 29, who had told him that if he wanted to propose he had to 'think of a cool way of proposing,' the couple told Bild newspaper. 

Mr Breier, a graphic designer, said: 'I kept turning it over in my mind and eventually came up with the idea of getting the message delivered by police.

'In Germany, the police routinely send a photograph of the driver together with a speeding notice, to prove who was at the wheel at the time of the offence.

'All I needed to do was hold something with the message so when she went off to a brunch with friends I drove off in our Volkswagen.

'Getting a speeding ticket isn't as easy as you think. It took me five times until I actually saw the camera flash.'

Big ask: Mr Breier was snapped by a speeding camera holding up a banner reading: 'Willst du mich heiraten?', meaning 'Will you marry me?'

When Anja, who did not give the paper her last name, opened the envelope on Christmas Day, she found the picture of her boyfriend holding the banner reading: 'Willst du mich heiraten?' - 'Will you marry me?' 

Anja said: 'After I'd read it I looked up and saw Christian down on one knee holding out the ring. And of course I said yes.'

Mr Breier told the magazine that he had to drive with precision to avoid a hefty fine under Germany's staggered penalty system.

If a driver stays within 10 km/h (6mph) of the speed limit, the offense results in a 15 Euro fine (£11) and no points. 

However, when a driver goes 25km/h (15mph) over the limit, it results in an 80 Eurp (£60) fine and one  point on his licence.

Although Mr Breier was fined £11, he said it was 'most definitely worth it, after all, she said yes and that is priceless'.
