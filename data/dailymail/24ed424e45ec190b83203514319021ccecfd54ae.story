Though one year ago Miley the husky was discovered as a stray dog sitting on top of a mound of trash and suffering from mange, she now has a full, fluffy white coat and is full of energy.

Her complete change was revealed in a YouTube video by dog rescuer Eldad Hagar and the rescue group Hope for Paws, which Hagar founded with his wife Audrey.

'I think dogs really appreciate the rescuers, you can really feel it,' Eldad Hagar says in the video, which was uploaded to YouTube last Saturday.

Going in for a kiss? Miley the husky is seen playing next to Eldad Hagar, who found her last year 

New start: Miley was lured away from the trash where she was found after an hour of reassurance, Hagar said

He continues 'Sometimes I see dogs long time after they were rescued, and you can tell that they appreciate it. It's just a special bond that was created between us during the rescue.'

Archival footage of Miley in the YouTube clip shows her being approached with food and a leash by Hagar in November 2013 as she sits on the mound of trash. 

'Okay so she definitely has mange,' Hagar said in the November footage. 

In the YouTube video, Hagar says of retrieving Miley 'We spent quite a while on that pile of trash. We spent an hour just to reassure her that everything will be fine because I wanted to be a positive experience for her, to create a less stressful event from this whole thing.'

He also recalls 'I mean it's interesting. She actually like, jumped into my car. She was so ready to be rescued.' 

Not alone: Miley has recovered from her illnesses and mane - and now has a fluffy white coat to prove it

'Many people don't realize how exhausting it is to be a stray dog,' Hagar also says. 'You're always on alert because you don't know who is gonna come behind you or who is gonna attack you or who is going to be not kind to you.'

The sickly pooch is then seen being taken in and cared for by workers. The video also shows her burgeoning friendship with Frankie, a chihuahua who was pullet out of an underground tunnel.

The healed pet runs around and hops on a bed as Hagar looks in the clip. 

The Huffington Post, which earlier reported on Miley's turnaround, said she was adopted four months after Hagar found her and took her in.  

He told the website last week 'To see Miley transforming from that dog who dying on a pile of trash, and now living in one of the most beautiful homes I have ever seen in my life is so amazing to me. It was very rewarding to see her so happy.'
