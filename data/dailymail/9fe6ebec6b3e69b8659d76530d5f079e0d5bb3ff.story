Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria are seeking medical attention to improve their sexual prowess and subjecting their wives to 'brutal, abnormal' sex acts, according to local doctors.

In an interview with activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, who are based in the terror group's de facto capital, doctors anonymously revealed details of the jihadis' warped sex drives.

Despite their claim to be ultra-conservative Islamic extremists, many of the militants are spending part of their monthly salary on kinky underwear for their wives and for the hundreds of young women and children they kidnapped and now keep or sell as sex slaves.

'Abnormal': Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria are seeking medical attention to improve their sexual prowess and subjecting their wives to 'brutal, abnormal' sex acts, according to local doctors

Kinky: Despite their claim to be ultra-conservative Islamic extremists, many of the militants (such as notorious commander Abu Wahib, pictured) are said buying 'strange' underwear for their wives

Details of the Sunni extremists' twisted sexual appetites emerged in a report by Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently into the terror group's brutally oppressive treatment of women.

'A large section of ISIS members suffer from sexual anomalies and brutal instinctive desire for sex,' the report reads.

It goes on to list the key reasons young women and girls particularly fear the militants' vehement sexual advances, stating that many females are too terrified to leave their homes due to the fighters' threats to subject them to 'sexual practices of a brutal and abnormal manner'.

Other so-called 'perversions' detailed in the report include ISIS fighters 'buying strange underwear for their women, desperately searching for 'blue pills in order to increase their strength to have more sex', and medical reports detailing injuries sustained by women due to the fighters' violent sex acts.

The activists also claim that the fighters take numerous wives to satisfy their demand for sex, and spend large amounts of time searching for 'sabaya' - kidnapped women and children, some of them as young as nine, who have been sold into sex slavery.

The near constant threat of rape and sexual assault has forced many of the women in Raqqa to fear walking the streets. 'The houses became their current tombs, because of fear from falling into the arms of the soldiers of the Caliph,' the report states.

Brutal: Local activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently claims ISIS' first act on seizing control of the city last year was to 'crack down on women' and to launch a 'vigorous search by ISIS fighters for wives'

Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently's report in to the militants' treatment of women focuses on the terrorists forcing local females into marriage.

It claims that the group's first act upon completely seizing control of Raqqa last year was to 'crack down on women' and to launch a 'vigorous search by ISIS fighters for wives'.

The reasons for the local marriages are three fold, the report says - firstly to tie the mostly foreign terrorists to local families, and secondly to bind the militants to the local area - giving them familial responsibilities that mean they are unlikely to desert or defect from the Islamic State.

The report says the militants have broken local rural customs, which traditionally saw young men and women marrying cousins or other relatives in order retain their family bonds. 

With ISIS fighters demanding the local women marry them instead, the local women are said to have been left utterly miserable, and in some cases suicidal.

The militants are understood to pay a dowry of between £2,000 and £5,000 for each marriage, depending on whether the marriage is to a woman from the city or the surrounding countryside.

Oppressed: Details of the Sunni extremists' twisted sexual appetites emerged in a report by Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently into the terror group's brutally oppressive treatment of women

As part of their so-called 'crack down' on women after seizing control of Raqqa, ISIS fighters demanded all women completely cover their body in public - including their hands; insisted women only venture outdoors when accompanied by a close relative, and prevented any woman older than 50 leaving the house, except in medical emergencies.

They also closed any centres of education catering to women, demanded women are surrounded by close female relatives if they are working, and relentlessly harassed those seen outdoors alone.

To force local families to effectively 'sell' their daughters to a jihadi husband, the militants took advantage of the poverty sweeping Raqqa to offer high dowries and welfare payments.

They also offered male relatives of the forced brides prominent jobs both within the terror group and the local area, in order to win the albeit reluctant support of the local citizens.

According to Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, ISIS even spread rumours that unmarried women were being kidnapped and never seen again - a rumour that encouraged young females into getting married out of fear for their safety if they chose to remain single.

The activists say that ISIS' barbaric treatment of the local female population has seen women risking their lives by trying desperately to escape their marriages. If they are later discovered, as many of them are, the women are either stoned to death as apostates or adulterers.
