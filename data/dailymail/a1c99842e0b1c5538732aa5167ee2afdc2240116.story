Shocking attack: Trevor Gray raped the woman after the pair had been out for drinks in Nottingham city centre the same night

A detective sergeant was jailed for eight years today for raping a mother in her home.

Trevor Gray attacked the 43-year-old woman after the pair had been out for drinks in Nottingham city centre that night, after meeting through mutual friends.

The Nottinghamshire detective forced the security chain on the front door of the mother of one’s house, climbed the stairs and attacked her as her child lay sleeping in a nearby room.

At Derby Crown Court today, Judge John Wait told Gray: 'These are grave offences.

'You forced an entry into a home where your victim and her child were entitled to feel safe.

'You took advantage of her intoxication to rape her. She felt - and was - violated in her own home.'

The jury took less than three hours to convict Gray yesterday of rape, attempted rape and sexual assault.

Judge Wait jailed Gray for eight years for rape, six years for attempted rape and four for sexual assault, to run concurrently.

The victim told the court she could not recall much of their date, despite only having three glasses of wine and lemonade and a 'strong' vodka and Coke bought for her by Gray.

She said she was shocked when Gray followed her out of a taxi outside her home.

She invited him inside 'through courtesy', before asking him to leave after 15 minutes because she was going to go to bed.

He left through the back door, saying he was going to get a taxi at the top of the road.

Gray then sent a text 
message to the woman from the street outside, which read, 'You are 
harsh' and forced his way back in minutes later.

The mother sobbed as she told the court her next recollection was of him being naked in her bed on top of her and raping her.

She told the court she had felt unable to confront Gray because her young child was in the house at the time.

Sentencing the father of two, who had separated from his wife just a month before the attack, Judge Wait said: 'You are intelligent and arrogant, you thought you would get away with it. You did not believe she would have the courage to complain or that if she did she would be believed.

'These are grave offences. You forced entry into the home where your victim and her child were entitled to feel safe. You took advantage of her intoxication to rape her. She felt and was violated.'

The detective, who has served in the police for more 20 years, will now be removed from Nottinghamshire Police.

Judge Wait said: 'I take account of your previous good record, your excellent service in sensitive roles within the police force and the high regard in which you were held by your colleagues. I take into account the fact that a sentence because of your profession will be harder for you to serve.'

Relatives, friends and police colleagues were in court today for the sentencing. Many sobbed as he was jailed for eight years.

But Judge Wait added that Gray’s actions had had a 'catastrophic effect' upon his victim’s life.

He said: 'She no longer feels safe in the home she had moved into with pride only eight weeks before. She cannot go to bed without feeling your presence in the room. Her life has been devastated.'

Gray was told he will serve half of the eight-year sentence in custody and the remainder on licence.

A restraining order was also put in place preventing him from contacting the victim either directly or indirectly and his name will be placed on the sex offenders’ register.

The detective sergeant was suspended from duty on July 27 last year, four days after the attack, pending the outcome of the investigation. He will now also face misconduct proceedings, Nottinghamshire Police said.

After the sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Mick Windmill-Jones, of the force’s professional standards directorate, said: 'We expect our officers and staff to act with the very highest standards of behaviour, integrity and professionalism - on or off duty.

'When they fail to display these qualities and commit a criminal offence, they can expect, like any other member of society, to be arrested, charged and prosecuted in a court of law.

'Trevor Gray’s actions go against everything the role of a police officer stands for, which is ultimately to protect innocent people.

'We take all reports of sexual assault and rape extremely seriously and do everything we can to both support victims and ensure cases like this are brought to justice, regardless of who the alleged offender is.'

The officer shook his head in the dock yesterday as he was convicted.

The court was told Gray, of Watnall, Notts, had 'plainly intended' to have sex with the woman and she had 'upset' his plans.

Steven Coupland, prosecuting, said: 'He tried to call her but she ignored his calls, and texted her and asked her to get him a cab.

Grave offences: The judge said Gray had 'violated' the mother in her own home

'Instead of him calling a cab himself, he decided to return to her address despite the fact it had been made plain he was being asked to leave.

'He rang the bell. He did not take the message. He found the door was not locked but had security chain on to make it secure.

'What he did was the force that chain. He went upstairs to where she was sleeping and went into her room. She woke to find he was on top of her.'

Mr Coupland said the victim recalled he tried to get her to touch him intimately, before raping her - even though she told him to stop.

Jurors were told the next memory the woman had was waking up at 5.30am to find Gray still in bed with her.

The woman said Gray appeared to be unaware she was 'uncomfortable' - even when she asked him several times how he had got into her home.

She eventually plucked up the courage to call him a taxi and, as he was leaving, spotted the broken security chain.

She told the jury Gray said: 'Don’t worry, I’ll fix it', causing her to lose her temper and push him out of the house.

Later that day, she told a friend her version of what had happened, then called Gray 'to go through the sequence of events'.

However, she said Gray appeared 'cold', and when he asked her, 'Does this put you off me?', she hung up.

The next day, she spoke with a police officer friend, who reported the matter to her superiors.

Gray claimed he had returned to the woman’s home and found her door ajar before forcing his way in because he 'thought something might have happened to her.'

He told the jury he 'fell back into his mode as a trained police officer and decided he would enter to save a life effectively', before finding the woman sitting up in bed awake.

The court heard Gray, who was suspended after his arrest, told officers she had initiated sex, and the pair had 'parted on good terms' with a kiss on the doorstep the following morning.

He said he had no idea anything was wrong until he received her call.

The court was told the pair had met on a night out with mutual friends around a month before the attack on July 24 last year. They swapped phone numbers and exchanged 'jokey' texts before meeting for a drink.

The woman said Gray appeared 'articulate, funny and pleasant', and they met again a few days later.

However, the woman said that despite only having a few drinks, she 'could not remember much' of the evening', and just had a 'vague recollection' of being unable to understand why Gray got out of the taxi at her house.

The woman added: 'I never invite people back to my house. Even if I have decided someone is OK, it is not something I do. I did not even find him attractive.

'I vaguely remember saying he needed to go, I needed to go to bed, and he needed to get a taxi from the top of the road. He went out the back door.

'My memory is of locking the door and putting the chain on. I remember being woken by the bell ringing lots and lots of times. I just ignored it and went back to sleep.

'The next thing, I was aware of a naked person. He was over me. I was in bed. I said "don’t do that". It was not what I wanted.'

Gray had denied rape, attempted rape and sexual assault.
