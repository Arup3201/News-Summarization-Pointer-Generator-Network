A Los Angeles man has survived an apparent suicide attempt at a gas station after setting himself on fire on Wednesday night.

Investigators say the driver - who has not been named or aged - was filling up at the Shell station on Clairemont Mesa Boulevard in Kearny Mesa, San Diego, about 5.30pm.

The man allegedly took the gas hose to his SUV, sat inside, sprayed fuel over himself and set himself alight.

The car quickly went up in flames, prompting a quick-thinking attendant inside to flip an emergency switch that cut the gas lines, according to NBC San Diego. 

Flamer: A man has somehow survived setting himself on fire in apparent suicide attempt in San Diego

Fire: Footage of the dramatic incident in Kearny Mesa was taken by a passer-by

Help: The footage shows one man (left) running over to the car with a bucket to try and put out the fire

Extinguish: The man throws the water on the SUV but it does not put out the flames

Close call: The car at the gas pump next to the one on fire only narrowly missed going up in flames too

The move, according to authorities, prevented a potential explosion.

Witnesses at the next pump said the man fled the car once he caught fire.

Covered in flames, he ran away from the pump, jumped to the floor and did the drop-and-roll technique.

He suffered burns to 50 percent of his body.

However he somehow survived and is now recovering in hospital.

Cell phone video from witnesses showed fire shooting from the vehicle.

Shut down: The gas station had to be closed for several hours following the fire

Scene: The fire occurred at the Shell station on Clairemont Mesa Boulevard in Kearny Mesa, San Diego, about 5.30pm Wednesday

One bystander can be seen running over with a bucket and throwing water on the car.

Firefighters extinguished the flames, and paramedics rushed the patient to the UCSD Burn Center.

The incident is still being investigated, with police reviewing video footage from the gas station.

If it turns out to be a suicide attempt - which they are suspecting - the man could face numerous arson charges.
