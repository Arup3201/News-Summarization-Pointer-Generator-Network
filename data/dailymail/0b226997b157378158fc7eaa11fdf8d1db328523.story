They say you either love it or hate it and it seems after years of hate Denmark is finally ready to love Marmite again after overturning a ban on the spread.

David Darlington, 49, owner of a supplier which sells British and American products to supermarkets, had a licence to stock the product approved three years after it was taken off the shelves.

The savory spread was first outlawed in 2011 because it contained added vitamins, a practice which is illegal under Dutch law.

A ban on Marmite has been overturned in Denmark meaning the yeast spread will be available in supermarkets for the first time in three years

However after paying £900 for a 'risk assessment' test to prove the spread isn't dangerous Mr Darlington has been granted a licence to stock Marmite.

Speaking to MailOnline, he said:  'I feel like it’s a victory. The Vikings have been defeated at last in the battle of Marmite.

'I hate Marmite myself, I can't stand the stuff, but I did this on the principle of the matter. I thought, how dare those b******* ban Marmite, it's a British institution.

'Plus I've had people, British, American and some Danish too, hounding me for years over this so I thought 'something's got to be done'.

Mr Darlington, who is originally from Birkenhead near Liverpool, added: 'It’s a victory that the British people should have because there are those who can’t live without Marmite.

'Don't get me wrong, I won't became a millionaire from selling the stuff, but it is a travesty that we've been without it for so long.'

The divisive vegetable spread was banned in under food laws passed in 2004 governing the sale of products fortified with added vitamins.

British shoppers in Copenhagen (pictured) campaigned for the spread to be brought back. The battle was eventually won by David Darlington, who owns a food supplier

Until it was removed from sale in 2011, Marmite had escaped the attention of food chiefs. However it was deemed unsafe because it contained added vitamin B12.

Marmite was among other products such as Australian alternative Vegemite, Horlicks, Ovaltine and Farley’s Rusks - all of which were banned.

While Mr Darlington does not have any Marmite in stock now, he has promised to have it back on shelves by September 15.

He has also successfully overturned a ban on American products such as Poptarts and pancake mix which use enriched flour.
