Part of Real Madrid's abject performance in the midweek 4-3 Champions League defeat by Schalke may have been a consequence of their two most attacking players occupying the same space.

Despite securing passage into the quarter-finals with a 5-4 aggregate win, the reigning champions were heavily criticised for their performance at the Bernabeu on Tuesday.

It has since emerged that fellow forwards Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema spent most of the game sharing the same No 9 position, according to a FIFA stats package

Nonetheless, both forwards found the target, with Ronaldo heading a brace to become the all-time top scorer in European club competitions, although the Portuguese remained angry by the performance and has refused to speak publicly again until the end of the season.

'I wont talk again until the end of the season,' Ronaldo told reporters. 

Ancelotti had earlier defended his top scorer, saying: 'He scored two very important goals but the rest were not at his level'.

But Ronaldo cut a frustrated figure after Madrid narrowly escaped elimination despite his two goals. 

Ronaldo notched up his 77th and 78th goals in Europe and put himself above former Real Madrid team-mate Raul and Barcelona's Lionel Messi.

The former Manchester United star is also level with Messi as the joint record all-time goalscorer in the Champions League proper - with 75 goals apiece in Europe's elite competition.
