Manchester City's injury woes continue to deepen after Edin Dzeko was ruled out of his side's game at Leicester after picking up a knock in the warm up.

Manuel Pellegrini was forced into a late change ahead of the match with 18-year-old Jose Pozo replacing the Bosnian striker.

It what come as a big blow to Pellegrini with his two other main strikers, in-form Sergio Aguero and Stevan Jovetic both out injured.

City lie three points behind the leaders Chelsea heading into a busy festive period, so Pellegrini will be hoping that Dzeko is available sooner rather than later.

Any potential lay off for Dzeko may force the City boss to delve into the January transfer window next month to sign a new forward.
