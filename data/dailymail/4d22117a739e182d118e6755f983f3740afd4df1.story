Annual tradition: Russian military academies cadets march at the Red Square

It is Russia's most important secular 
holiday, honoring the huge military and civilian losses of World War II 
and showing off the country's modern arsenal

Putin told 11,000 
servicemen standing in tight formation on the square and the war 
veterans in the spectator stands that 'we remember what the tragedy of 
war means and will do everything so that nobody will ever dare to 
unleash it anew, threaten our children, our homes and our land.'

He added, 'We will do everything to strengthen security on the planet.'

The Soviet Union lost an estimated 26 million people in the war, of whom 8.5 million were soldiers.

Among the thousands of spectators along the square were elderly World War II veterans, displaying rows of medals.

Putin
 lauded them, saying "We will always remember that it was Russia, the 
Soviet Union, that ruined the misanthropic, bloody, arrogant plans of 
the fascists.'

Although Russian armed forces 
suffered from severe funding shortages and morale problems in the early 
years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the parade put forth the 
image of a spit-and-polish and vigorous military, with an emphasis on 
discipline and precision.

In 2010 the Victory Day period was marked by repeated complaints from Dmitry Medvedev
 and other officials that some countries denigrate the Soviet Union's 
contribution in WWII, in which some 26 million Soviets died, according 
to some estimates.
