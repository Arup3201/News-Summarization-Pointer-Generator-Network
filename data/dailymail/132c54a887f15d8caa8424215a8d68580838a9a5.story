More than a year on from the birth of Prince George the world is gearing up for the birth of another royal heir, this time in Monaco.

Prince Albert II of Monaco and his wife Princess Charlene attend the annual picnic in 'Le Parc Princesse Antoinette' in Monaco yesterday, once again giving the excited population – and world’s media- a glimpse of the Princess’s burgeoning baby bump.

The 36-year-old royal certainly seems to be enjoying an early pregnancy glow, looking tanned and radiant at her husband’s side holding a delicate bouquet of pink and white roses.

The royal couple announced they are expecting their first child just two months ago, and a tiny bump was just visible under Charlene's deep blue dress 

The Princess, 36, carried a small bouquet of pink and white roses as the pair greeted children in the park

The Princess wore a collared sleeveless dress in a deep blue, with a matching belt resting just above her tiny bump.

She kept her footwear sensible with a pair of tanned ballet pumps and swept her blonde hair back off her face in a chic low chignon.

Charlene and her 56-year-old husband were welcomed by dancers wearing traditional costume as they arrived for the event, known as ‘Monaco’s picnic’.

They looked relaxed throughout the low key event, though Albert kept his attire formal for the official engagement in a blazer, shirt and tie.

The pair married on July 1 2011 and announced they were expecting their first child just two months ago.

Charlene wore a collared sleeveless dress in a deep blue and swept her blonde hair back off her face in a chic low chignon, while Albert chose a smart blazer, white shirt and tie

The annual event, known as 'Monaco's picnic' is held in the Princess Antoinette Park 

In June, Prince Albert told The Associated Press that he and his wife were 'overjoyed', 'thrilled' and 'very excited' about the impending arrival of their child.

He said they are 'taking every cautious step to make sure everything goes well'.

Albert, now 56, was a longtime bachelor who has acknowledged fathering two children out of wedlock - daughter Jazmin Grace Grimaldi, born in 1992 to American Tamara Rotolo, and Alexandre Coste, born in 2003 to Togo native Nicole Coste.

The couple have not slowed down their royal duties since the announcement however, attending a charity event together on Friday.

The expectant mother, who is due to give birth in December, wowed in a sleeveless midnight blue floor-length gown, which gave just a small hint of her growing baby.
