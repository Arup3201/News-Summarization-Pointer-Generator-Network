Dark horses two, dark forces nil. Uruguay can now join Luis Suarez in watching the World Cup from home, banished not by FIFA or a dastardly European conspiracy, but a young man who has proved it is possible to play football from the heavens, without simultaneously dragging the game into the gutter.

James Rodriguez, now the tournament top scorer, made it five goals in four World Cup games for Colombia, including what may prove to be the highlight of this World Cup. It is human nature to hope that we have not seen the best already, but it is also possible that tonight we did.

Any contender for goal of the tournament will have to go some to top the strike that put daylight between these teams after 28 minutes of stalemate. Before Uruguay had a chance to respond after regrouping in the dressing-room, James – known throughout Colombia by his first name – followed it with a beautifully-worked second four minutes after half-time, and the contest was over.

James Rodriguez was a 100-1 outsider to win the Golden Boot behind more well-known players such as Lionel Messi and Neymar.

But the Colombian midfielder struck twice in the last 16 clash with Uruguay and now has five goals in the tournament and leads the race to be the top goal scorer.

Rodriguez is now as short as 2-1 to end the World Cup with the Golden Boot

It was a 
match of karmic delight. Colombia got what they deserved: a 
quarter-final date with Brazil that will leave the hosts more than a 
little apprehensive; Uruguay got what they deserved: nothing and the 
bum’s rush to the airport. They were confirmed as a one-man team, their 
shameful indulgence of Suarez’s worst excesses exposed as nothing more 
than a shield to cover their own inadequacies. Uruguay must tolerate 
Suarez, for without him they offer so little.

They
 have played 22 World Cup matches with him since 2010 and have lost 
five. They have played five without him in that time, and lost four. 
Once he was gone it was a matter of time before they followed. 

How
 fitting that the architect of their downfall was the player of the 
tournament so far, 22, but looking younger, an anti-Suarez, playing with
 a smile not a snarl.

Pick that one out: Rodriguez celebrates his wonder goal

James’s
 bite in Brazil has come from having decisive influence on Colombia’s 
impressive progress, not a malevolent act of aggravated harm, and it was
 fitting that Uruguay’s unlovable apologists were removed from the 
competition by his wit and talent, an elevation of football’s spirit 
that was met with joy in the fitting surrounds of the Maracana Stadium.

By
 the end, the Uruguayans in the crowds were reacting angrily to 
Colombian mockery of their limitations. Good. They deserved it. Many 
turned up with their Suarez masks and chants and a well-honed victim 
mentality encouraged by their coach Oscar Tabarez, but it was not 
enough. They will depart feeling hard done by, but were not. The best 
team won. The good guys, too.

Colombia
 are deserved quarter-finalists and Brazil will not look forward to 
facing them on this evidence. James in particular, is an exquisite 
talent, a player of true fantasy, capable of scoring a goal to grace any
 game, in any competition, and certainly worthy of this famous stadium. 
The execution was close to perfect.

The
 play was switched from one flank to the other, for a cross headed out 
by Uruguay’s Maximiliano Pereira. It was put back in, hopefully, by Abel
 Aguilar and fell to James. He took the ball on his chest, pivoted, 
checked his position and volleyed it with his left foot from 20 yards.

The
 ball dipped over Fernando Muslera’s despairing hand, struck the 
crossbar – as the greatest-looking goals often do – and bounced down and
 over the line. Fans of a certain age may know this as a Tony Yeboah.

There
 were cheers when it went in, but gasps for the many replays. It was a 
special goal, one that will be replayed, revisited and savoured 
throughout the coming weeks. Colombia’s next, while not as spectacular, 
was equally well worked.

Another
 lovely passing move found its way out to Pablo Armero and his deep 
cross was met by the impressive Juan Cuadrado, unselfishly cushioning a 
gentle header back into the path of James, who finished smartly from 
close range. Uruguay were done. Colombia eased off after that, but 
without fear of reprisal. Minus Suarez, Uruguay are snarky, but 
toothless. Their captain, Diego Lugano, managed to get booked for 
complaining from the substitutes bench, which seemed appropriate.

James
 will turn 23 on the eve of the final if Colombia stick around, and has 
now scored in every game of Colombia’s four, the first player to perform
 this feat in the competition since Ronaldo and Rivaldo for Brazil in 
2002. The two R’s – there was a third, of course, in Ronaldinho – were 
playing for the eventual world champions, though. A free-scoring, 
free-wheeling Brazilian team, dragged from the wreckage of a horrid 
qualifying campaign by Luis Felipe Scolari and transformed into 
something quite miraculous.

James,
 by contrast, is not playing for one of the world’s superpowers, or 
tournament favourites – certainly not since Falcao was invalided out of 
the action towards the end of last season. Yet he currently tournament 
top scorer having started the competition the same price to win the 
Golden Boot as Rickie Lambert, who made it onto the pitch for three 
minutes in a single game against Uruguay. Who says the English are 
deluded?

Falcao,
 a powerful striker of the type that is so popular right now, was seen 
as crucial to Colombian hopes and, without him, it was feared Jose 
Pekerman’s team would be shorn of their cutting edge. Now they have to 
be considered an outside bet for the competition such is the optimism 
inspired by James’s form. He scores, he creates, he torments, he tests.

The joke's on you: Uruguay fans wear fake fangs and a dog mask to mock Suarez's bite against Italy 

Already
 a £37.5m player after moving from Porto to Monaco, he may well yet be 
one of the stellar transfers in Europe this summer, on the back of this 
campaign. A goalscorer, a match-winner, a classic number ten but with 
the heart and energy required of the modern game, he has looked a cut 
above many of the more famous names on display in Brazil and has now 
scored in Colombia’s last six matches. Who could afford him – and, of 
those that could, who wouldn’t want him?

Out
 here, in the international game, Brazil would love him, so too Spain or
 Germany and Italy have nothing like him, either. England? Well, we’d 
find a way of ruining him obviously, but that’s not the point. James has
 been a thing of beauty at this World Cup and Brazil will not enjoy 
dealing with his invention in Fortaleza next Friday. It is often said 
that Scolari’s team it stronger defensively than going forward, and it 
will need to be. Yet Colombia showed they could defend, too – not least 
enforcer and captain Mario Yepes and goalkeeper David Ospina.

Their
 passing was, at times, superb, producing enthusiastic cries of ole from
 their fervent, colourful support. Brazil, obviously, intimidate their 
continental rivals, as was shown in yesterday’s penalty shoot-out with 
Chile, when all confidence seemed to drain from Jorge Sampaoli’s men. 
Colombia will need to overcome those feelings of inadequacy, too.

Yet
 one player, at least, has nothing to feel inferior about. James is 
being mentioned in the same breath as some of the greatest players to 
ever wear Brazil’s yellow shirt. He is having the tournament of a 
lifetime. Come July 12, he may have a lot more to celebrate than just 
turning 23.
