Masa Vukotic was murdered in a random attack at a Melbourne Park last Tuesday 

In the lead up to the funeral for random stabbing victim Masa Vukotic, the school girl's mother has shared her 'heartache' after her daughter's tragic death.

Natasa Vukotic has publicly paid tribute to her 'funny, intelligent and kind-hearted' 17-year-old for the first time since she was killed at a Melbourne park near Doncaster last Tuesday.

'The loss of Masa has left a heartache that will never heal, but her love has left us with memories that no on can take from us,' Ms Vukotic said, according to the Herald Sun. 

'She will be remembered for her bright smile and her inspirational attitude to life… she was our everything.' 

A funeral for the teenager, who was killed just five minutes from her home at 7pm while exercising at the park, will take place on Thursday with hundreds of people expected to attend.

Devastated friends and family have  organised numerous pink-themed parades and marches for Masa, who was known to have loved 'Lolita Japanese fashion', with her mother thanking the public for their support.

Hundreds of flowers, stuffed toys, cards and candles have also been left at the scene of the tragedy by loved ones and strangers alike, who have also paid tribute to 'beautiful Princess Marci' on Facebook.

Sean Price, 31, was charged with murdering Masa, along with committing six other crimes, at Melbourne Magistrates Court last week.

Police allege he went on a rampage of rape, assault and an attempted car-jacking in the hours after he is accused of killing the 17-year-old and before he handed himself into police.

Ms Vukotic's grief-stricken father, Slabvoljub Vukotic, locked eyes with Price during the court hearing while sitting just 10 metres away from the accused.

In a Facebook event post for the memorial tribute, Ms Vukotic's friends wrote: 'On the 28th of this month, we will be holding a memorial for our dear friend. Please, invite your friends to come. No alcohol or drugs are permitted as this is strictly a memorial event. Marci needs to be remembered - her name needs to be known. She was an amazing influence on so many lives.'

The memorial picnic will be held at Queen Victoria Gardens and will be called 'Princess Marci's Royal Picnic'.

Her friends are asking people to wear pink or 'Lolita Japanese fashion' as an ode to Masa's style, or something 'rabbit-related' as she was so fond of her pet rabbit, Roger. 

'The world has certainly become a darker place without her,' a friend told Daily Mail Australia. 

'Marci was without a doubt one of the most wonderful people I've ever met,' another friend said.

'She was so full of personality and passion and her sense of humour was incredible.'

'Everyone who met you loved you Marci, you're gone but will never be forgotten,' one of her friends wrote on Facebook

Using the hashtag #pinkformarci her friends drew these touching tributes of Princess Marci. One friend wrote: 'I had no pink clothes to wear in her honour so here's a pretty pink piece for the friend we lost'

One of her talented friends drew her as an angel with the caption 'rest in peace, Princess' 

'She inspired myself and so many others to love ourselves and be confident in who we are. She never missed a moment to remind her friends that she thought they were wonderful.'

Friends spoke fondly of her love of the colour pink, her pet rabbit Roger, dressing up and Japanese fashion.

Masa, who only just turned 17 in December, was one of three children from a Serbian family who had moved to Melbourne from Montenegro.

Her distressed relatives were pictured arriving at the park following news of her death.

Ms Vukotic has been remembered as a 'loving, sweet, smart' young woman with a zest for life and a bright future

Her body was found by police along a walking track when a neighbour called triple zero after hearing screams and saw a man fleeing the scene.

She was in cardiac arrest when she was found, but paramedics were unable to save her and she died at the scene.

Police say she was wearing headphones at the time and may not have heard the attacker approaching.

Ms Vukotic has been described as a bright girl who knew three languages and was focussed on her dream of becoming a lawyer.

'It's such a shame she'll never reach those dreams now,' a friend said.

'She never let anything or anyone stand in her way. She was passionate and driven and I love her very much.'

'She was an absolutely gorgeous girl and without fail would always make me laugh or smile,' said a friend.

'I can only wish her self-confidence and will to learn inspires others and her memories live on for the years to come.'

The friends shared photos of Ms Vukotic with a bright smile on her face as she dressed up for 'Cosplay', where people dress up as fictional characters for conventions.
