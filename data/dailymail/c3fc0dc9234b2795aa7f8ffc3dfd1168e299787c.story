Strong direction: Allen, pictured, who has been criticized before for not featuring homosexuals in his movies, admits he had a heavy hand in producing the Broadway show

Woody Allen is under fire for failing to have any black gangsters in his Broadway musical about legendary 1920s Harlem nightspot, the Cotton Club.

Allen insists he always casts regardless of race, but the New York Daily News cites a source as saying the quirky filmmaker specifically requested there be no African-American stars in his show.

'Bullets Over Broadway' is an adaption of Allen's 1994 screenplay of the same name and stars Zach Braff as the lead. 

'Everyone's white at Woody’s Cotton Club and in the gangster numbers,' a Broadway insider told the Daily News' Confidential.

The
 source told the newspaper a big-name African-American actor was being 
considered but Woody pulled out, deciding for some reason that 'a black 
gangster wouldn't be good,' despite the play being set in Harlem.

The musical opens tonight, and contrasts starkly to another Broadway show based on the Cotton Club, called 'After Midnight.'

The
 iconic club was popular with black clubgoers, so casting reportedly 
told Allen a scene re-creating the nightspot would look strange without 
any.

The only actor in the entire show who isn't white is Kelcy Griffin, who is in the dance ensemble, the Daily News reports.

The Daily News earlier reported that he had banned reporters from a meet-and-greet and ignored actors' pleas to drop a finale number.

A spokesman for Allen told the Daily News: 'Your item is completely untrue. It has always been Woody Allen's priority to cast the exact appropriate person for a role regardless of race, which has never been a consideration.'

In contrast, 'After Midnight,' which opened in November, has a completely black cast apart from singer k.d. lang.
