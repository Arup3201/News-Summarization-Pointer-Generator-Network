Fuel supplier Caltex is to cut 350 jobs in Australia as part of a huge business shake-up.

The job losses at the petrol and diesel company will come over the next 12 months and are expected to deliver benefits of about $100 million a year before tax by 2016.

The cuts to operational and support function staff are in addition to the previously announced reductions relating to the October closure of the Kurnell refinery in Sydney.

They were announced on Monday by Caltex Chief Executive Julian Segal and come as the company declared a one per cent rise in profit to $173 million.

Caltex is currently converting its Kurnell refinery to an import terminal.

'As a result of the review, headcount will reduce by approximately 350 people across operational and support functions,' Caltex said.

'The reduction will take place over time with the majority expected to occur within the next 12 months,' the company added.

Staff are expected to be offered redeployment opportunities and redundancy entitlements.

Caltex's shake-up is part of its plan to 'evolve into one value chain from product sourcing to customer' its website said.

In July 2012, Caltex announced it would cut up to 630 jobs while closing the Kurnell refinery.

'Our balance sheet remains strong and, despite operating within a competitive and ever changing environment, the outlook for our business continues to be positive,' Mr Segal on Monday.
