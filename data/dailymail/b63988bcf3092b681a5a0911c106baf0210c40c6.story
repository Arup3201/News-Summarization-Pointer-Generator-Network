More than 7,000 Kia cars owned by British drivers are being recalled because of faulty seatbelts.

The recall affects 5,787 Sportage models and 1,432 Soul vehicles and concerns a possible fault with the vehicle’s seatbelt pre-tensioner.

The problem was noticed during monitoring of customers’ vehicles, and the Korean carmaker said it did not think the fault had led to any injuries.

Precaution: The recall affects 5,787 Sportage models made in Kia's Slovakia factory between 2011 and 2012

But it said some pre-tensioners might not work properly because of a faulty piston in the mechanism.

Introduced in the 1980s, pretensioners
 are devices which use sensors in a car to pre-emptively tighten the 
belt if the car comes to a sudden stop.

The Sportage models affected were built at Kia’s Slovakia factory between October 2011 and November 2012, and the Soul vehicles were built at Kwangju in Korea between August 2011 and March 2012.

The fault does not affect the latest Soul, which has just gone on sale in the UK.

Although Kia is not aware of any injuries
 due to the possible fault, the firm said it will contact all British 
owners of the cars and advise them to take their vehicles to a Kia 
dealer for a full system check.

Fault: Also affected are 1,432 Soul models which were built in Korea between 2011 and 2012
