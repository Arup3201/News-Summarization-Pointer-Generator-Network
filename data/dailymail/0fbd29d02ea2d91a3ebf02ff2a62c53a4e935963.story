A scuba diver was forced to wrestle an octopus after it tried to dismantle his £9,000 underwater camera.

Joe Kistel set up his equipment next to what he suspected to be the lair of an octopus off the coast of Jacksonville, Florida.

The curious subject emerged to investigate the camera, Mr Kistel couldn't believe the amazing footage he was getting as the octopus latched its suckers onto the camera lens for an extreme close-up.

Trapped: The octopus began to wrap its tentacles around the camera which could have destroyed the footage

However Mr Kistel soon realised that all was not well when he spotted in its tentacles a gasket keeping water from rushing into the camera and destroying the footage.

Mr Kistel, an underwater videographer for the marine-conservation nonprofit TISIRI, was forced to desperately wrestle it back in a dramatic game of tug of war with the underwater critter.

He said: 'The octopus came out of its lair to see what the camera was really about. At this point, he engulfs this camera. 

'It looked as if he wanted to take a selfie - he embellished this thing.

Inquisitive: The octopus coming out of this den to investigate Mr Kistel's underwater camera

Mr Kistel soon realised the octopus had a gasket in its tentacles which  stops water getting into the camera

'All you can see in the footage is this octopus' legs coming around this thing and where his mouth would be covering the lens.

'So I thought I'd leave the camera running and see what we capture here.

'But as I'm off to the side watching this take place, I noticed it had something string like in its arms.

'At
 first I didn't know what it was, but then I started to panic because I 
knew exactly what it was - one of the critical gaskets on the underwater
 camera housing. 

'The gasket is what keeps the water out. The octopus just dismantled the camera.

'I
 panicked and started flailing around. I'm actually fighting with this 
octopus, playing tug of war trying to get the gasket back.

'Fortunately I got lucky and the octopus let go and the camera stayed dry.'
