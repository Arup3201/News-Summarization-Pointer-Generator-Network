Sobering numbers: World Trade Organization Director-General Pascal Lamy warned of a Depression-era protectionism (file photo)

Global trade almost stagnated last year and the world is at risk of a return to Depression-era protectionism, a leading international watchdog warned yesterday.

The World Trade Organisation said trade between nations grew by just 2 per cent in 2012 – down from 5.2 per cent in 2011 and the second-worst figure since records began in 1981.

The Geneva-based body said trade would increase by 3.3 per cent this year instead of the 4.5 per cent it forecast  in September.

WTO director-general Pascal Lamy described the figures as ‘sobering’.

He said it was now more likely that countries would resort to putting up trade barriers in a futile attempt to protect their economies from outside competition.

‘The threat of protectionism may be greater now than at any time since the start of the crisis, since other policies to restore growth have been tried and found wanting,’ said Mr Lamy.

A wave of protectionist measures such as trade barriers exacerbated the Great Depression in the 1930s and it is feared that a return to such policies would be a disaster for the global economy.

The threat of a worldwide currency war, in which countries deliberately devalue their currencies to make exports more competitive and drive economic growth, could lead to governments putting up tariffs to protect their manufacturers.

Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, has warned that such measures  could ‘lead to a disastrous collapse in activity around the world’ with every country suffering ‘ruinous consequences’.

Global trade has grown at an average rate of 5.3 per cent a year over the past two decades, according to the WTO.

But the two per cent rise in 2012 was the weakest increase since records began in 1981. The only worse performance was in 2009 during the depths of the Great Recession when trade fell.

The WTO blamed the sharp slowdown on weak economic growth in developed countries and continued uncertainty over the future of the crisis-torn euro.

‘The events of 2012 should serve as a 
reminder that the structural flaws in economies that were revealed by 
the economic crisis have not been fully addressed, despite important 
progress in some areas,’ said Mr Lamy. ‘Repairing these fissures needs 
to be the priority for 2013.’

He went on: ‘The final trade figures for 2012 are quite sobering,’ sadding that 2013 would see ‘more of the same’.

The WTO warned that a ‘double speed’ global economy was emerging with developing countries outperforming richer nations.

It said: ‘Improved economic prospects for the United States in 2013 should only partly offset the continued weakness in the European Union, whose economy is expected to remain flat or even contract slightly this year according to consensus estimates.

‘China’s growth should continue to outpace other leading economies, cushioning the slowdown, but exports will still be constrained by weak demand in Europe.’

But Mr Lamy said global trade would pick up next year with growth of five per cent.

The 158 economies which make up the WTO set trade rules among themselves in an attempt to ensure a level playing field and spur growth by opening markets and removing trade barriers, including subsidies, excessive taxes and regulations.

Created in 1995, the WTO launched its Doha round of talks in 2001 with the stated aim of underpinning development in poorer nations, but the talks have faltered.
