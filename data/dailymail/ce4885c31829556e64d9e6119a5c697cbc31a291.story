A border terrier fell from a 150ft clifftop after chasing a blackbird off the edge - and survived without a scratch on her.

Eight-month-old Lola was running at Splash Point in Seaford, Sussex, when she spotted the bird and chased it before running straight off the cliff and plummeting into the sea.

Her terrified owner 47-year-old Clare Callard, from Seaford, watched as her pet disappeared from view.

She feared the worst until another walker further up the cliff called to her that the tide was in and she could see the dog trying to swim to safety.

Mrs Callard frantically dialled 999 who put her through to the coastguard who then contacted the local lifeguard at Seaford.

The stay-at-home mum of two said: 'It is incredible, it is a miracle.

'She wasn't even close to the edge but it all happened so quickly I didn't even have time to shout her name.

'She is always chasing birds and crows but suddenly I just watched her disappear over the edge.

'Lola has never been swimming before so I couldn't believe she instinctively managed to get herself to safety.

'Remarkably the tide was not in completely so there was a small shingle area which she climbed out onto and sat on there.

'The lifeguard was able to take his paddle board and hold Lola's collar as she sat on it and he brought her to safety.

'My husband, Steve, wrapped her up in his big coat as she was shaking so much.'

Mrs Callard's husband and their two children, nine-year-old twins Joseph and Jessica, were beneath the cliffs playing with a kite when the accident happened on Saturday.

The family then took the dog to their local vets.

Mrs Callard said Lola was sitting subdued on her lap until another dog walked into the surgery when she started wagging her tail and jumped down onto the floor.

Mrs Callard said: 'The vet said it was a great sign as the next two hours after an accident are crucial.

'Animals can die of shock or have internal injuries. They observed her for a while and then checked her over. She didn't have a scratch on her.

'Her breath was slightly raspy because she had a small amount of water in her lungs which the vet said is not affecting her ability to breath and will pass through naturally.'

A Seaford lifeguard said: 'It's not common but it has happened a few times. Lola was very lucky because the tide was in and I suspect she hit the water with quite a thud.

'But it's good to hear she survived and I'm glad our team could help.'

Mrs Callard said: 'We don't usually go walking on the cliffs and had only gone that day to use the kites.

'Now I know I will never take Lola for a walk on those cliffs again. I would never have forgiven myself if something had happened to her.'
