The King of Belgium last night said he will abdicate in favour of his son.

King Albert, 79, said that because of his ‘age and health’ he will pass the throne to Crown Prince Philippe, 53, this month.

However, his decision follows the opening of court proceedings over his illegitimate daughter.

Announcement: King Albert II of Belgium is expected to announce his abdication after 20 years on the throne, this afternoon

Prime Minister Elio Di Rupo said he, too, would make an official announcement immediately after the king's speech, further heightening expectations the 20-year reign of Albert is drawing to a close.

In August, Albert would mark his second decade on the throne of the kingdom of 10.5 million people.

The nation celebrates Independence Day on July 21 and many have said that could be an ideal day to hand over the largely ceremonial post.

Albert’s reign has been largely peaceful although the nation has struggled with an increasing divide between the northern, Dutch-speaking Flanders and the southern, French-speaking Wallonia.

After he succeeded his brother Baudouin in 1993, Albert became embroiled in a major royal scandal when he was force to acknowledge the existence of an out-of-wedlock daughter, Delphine Boel.

His marriage with Queen Paola, the daughter of a member of the Argentinian Junta, suffered a major crisis, and the issue was brought into the spotlight yet again this spring when Boel opened court proceedings to prove she is the king's daughter.

She has called upon her alleged half-siblings, Crown Prince Philip and Princess Astrid to provide DNA to prove her case.

During his 20 years on the throne, Albert I has gone from turned from a king with a love of sleek motorcycles into an elderly monarch sometimes relying on a walking stick.

Adding to his troubles was the eternal political strife within the nation itself.

When Belgium found itself without a government for a record 541 days before the team of Di Rupo could take the oath late in 2011, Albert had to be involved in the protracted talks because one of the few real powers a Belgian monarch has is to appoint government brokers.

If he abdicates in favour of his son, he will be the second European monarch to do so this year. Belgium's neighbor, the Netherlands, has already seen an abdication this year. Queen Beatrix - now known as Princess Beatrix - stepped down after a 33-year reign of neighbouring Netherlands

Her eldest son was appointed King Willem-Alexander at a lavish ceremony in Amsterdam on April 30.
