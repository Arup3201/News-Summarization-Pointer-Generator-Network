A Tory MP has written to Lord Justice Leveson to ask him to investigate the BBC’s conduct over the Jimmy Savile affair.

Anne Main said the corporation has questions to answer over claims that senior figures were aware of allegations against the entertainer as far back as the 70s.

The MP for St Albans said the claims raised concerns about the ‘culture, practice and ethics’ of the BBC – and argued that meant Leveson should look at the organisation as part of his inquiry into media ethics.

Despite the increasing number of claims that Savile abused underage girls on BBC premises, the corporation insists it has no records of complaints against him.

But earlier this week Rodney Collins, who worked as a BBC press officer in the 70s, said the corporation was ‘certainly’ aware of the allegations.

The editor of the BBC’s flagship news programme Newsnight has also been criticised for pulling an investigation into the abuse claims.

In a letter to Leveson, Mrs Main said the allegations of a BBC culture of silence were ‘very serious’ and ‘at, the very least, of the same gravity levelled at some newspaper groups about which your inquiry has heard extensive and lengthy evidence’.

She went on: ‘Given that your inquiry’s remit also covers the UK’s broadcasters, I have concerns that the public would find it incomprehensible that such serious allegations have only been looked at internally by the BBC.

‘Your inquiry has heard from many that statutory regulation should be imposed  upon the press.

'However, it begs the question over the impact that statutory regulation has  had on the BBC.’

She added: ‘Given the huge public interest about the “culture, practice and ethics” of  the national broadcaster, and that your inquiry is not yet concluded, I believe it would  be timely and relevant, and within remit, to incorporate an investigation into the handling and reporting of numerous allegations, some of which are still coming forward into the public domain.’
