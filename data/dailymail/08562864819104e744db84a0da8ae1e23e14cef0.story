Harry Redknapp claims the days of QPR’s crazy spending is over after they won promotion back to the Barclays Premier League.

The Rangers manager guided the club back to the top flight on Saturday with a dramatic 1-0 victory over Derby at Wembley.

Redknapp said: ‘We're not just going to bring players in willy-nilly. We've got to make sure anyone who comes in is the right character and will come in and do a good job for the team. That's all that's important.

‘There are seven teams who are going to be the top seven teams again next year. You could name now, in whatever order they're going to be in, they're going to be the top seven. 

‘And it'll be a scrap everywhere else. I've not even thought about a player. 

‘I’ve not even thought about what kind of player we're looking at, because you don't know what division you're going to be in.’
