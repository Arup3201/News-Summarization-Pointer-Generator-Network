Peshmerga-chic? In videos and photographs to publicise its latest line, H&M stylists modelled the £14.99 jumpsuit with military boots and a high-waist belt

H&M has been forced into a grovelling apology after being accused of modelling a new khaki jumpsuit on the uniforms worn by female Kurdish soldiers battling Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

Dozens of Kurds took to social media today to vent their outrage at the perceived gaffe after the Swedish fashion retailer released its Autumn/Winter collection earlier this month, including the olive-green all-in-one. 

In videos and photographs to publicise the line, H&M stylists modelled the £14.99 jumpsuit - one of the collection's standout pieces - with military boots and a high-waist belt.

And today it was claimed the ensemble bears a striking resemblance to the loose-fitting fatigues worn by female fighters of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), who have been fighting alongside the Kurdish Peshmerga to repel the Isis onslaught.

'Disgraceful to say the least,' Arwin Banirad wrote on Facebook. 'At times like these, they choose to capitalise from the brave kurdish fighters in Kurdistan. They should be ashamed of themselves!'

Ali Najat Barzinjy added: 'Wtf this is our traditional uniform it is not for every one.'

Candace Ernst: said: 'H&M why don't you show some f***ng respect an fight with them in your stupid clothes.'

Another social media user, Rawan Barwari, even suggested that H&M should consider giving some of the proceeds from the jumpsuit sales to the Kurdish fighters and their families.

And today H&M apologised, claiming any similarities between its new range and the Kurdish uniforms are merely coincidental.

'We are truly sorry if we have offended anyone with this piece, this was of course never our intention,' said Ida Ståhlnacke, H&M's global press officer, in a statement. 'At H&M we want to offer the latest within fashion and trends and we continuously listen to our customers requests. 

'The last seasons we have seen an increasing demand on jumpsuits and therefore we currently offer a selection of jumpsuits in different colors and materials, such as denim blue and deep red. 

'The jumpsuit in question is made in a light and comfortable material and is a part of a larger collection consisting of many garments in khaki green, which also is one of the trendiest colors this season.  

'The opinions of our customers are very important to us and we will keep this feedback in mind for future collections.'

The so-called 'Peshmerga look' has been a hot topic on social media, with many Kurds agreeing that the jumpsuit looks more like the uniform of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG), rather than that of the renowned Kurdish armed group, the Peshmerga.

Consisting of both male and female soldiers, the YPG is the armed wing of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). 

It is one of several Kurdish armed groups which are currently fighting Islamic State in both Iraq and Syria. The YPG has been fighting hard to defend the strategic town of Kobani near the Syrian-Turkish border. 

Similarity? Many Kurdish social media users claimed the outfit bears a striking resemblance to the loose fitting fatigues worn by female Kurdish fighters battling Islamic State

Women fighters for the Kurdish PKK militia are protecting the area around Lalish mountain, where a Yazidi city is home to the most important shrine of the Yazidi faith. Some have suggested H&M should donate some of the proceeds of the jumpsuit to their cause

Since IS militants started their offensive on Kobani two weeks ago, thousands of civilians have fled the Syrian town and have been trying to escape over the Turkish border. 

Many Kurdish men and women have also joined the Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State.  

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported yesterday that a female YPG soldier carried out a suicide bombing mission, killing a number of Islamic State fighters. 

The fighter allegedly used a grenade to blow herself up near an important Islamic State position in the eastern part of Kobani. The woman has been named as Arin Mirkan, a commander in the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG). She is thought to be the first female suicide bomb attack against Islamic State.

The YPG have since released a statement, confirming Mirkan's death: 'Of our martyrs was valiant comrade Arin. She was able to perform a fedai [sacrifice] action and kill dozens of ISIS mercenaries and stop their advance. 

'Such strong will and determination shown by comrade Arin will be the spirit of resistance in the hearts of all of our combatants of the People's Defense Units and Women's Defense Units. If needed, all of our fighters will be comrade Arin and shall not allow the mercenaries reach their wishes at whatever cost.'
