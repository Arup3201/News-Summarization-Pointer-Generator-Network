Many Labour MPs privately think Ed Miliband will not win next year’s general election, according to former frontbencher Diane Abbott.

The outspoken MP told a fundraising dinner that a ‘substantial minority’ of her colleagues did not believe they would form the next government – despite being ahead in the polls.

She suggested even those at the top of the party doubted Mr Miliband’s credentials, saying it was ‘problematic’ that many of the Shadow Cabinet had not backed him as leader in 2010.

Miss Abbott was at the dinner at Monty’s Nepalese restaurant in west London to raise money for Labour’s candidate in Ealing Central, Rupa Huq - the sister of the former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq.

She was heard saying to senior local Labour figures: ‘Most MPs are worried that we won’t win in May - and that’s not based on figures.

‘Let’s say a substantial minority of Labour MPs don’t think we can win in May — despite the fact that statistically it can look like that. But then they tend to be MPs from outside of London.

‘Ed’s problem, one of his problems, is that he has a Shadow Cabinet and most of them didn’t vote for him, so that is problematic.’

Miss Abbott also apparently said during the unguarded exchange that whichever party forms the next government they would ‘have to put up taxation’, according to the Evening Standard.

The MP for Hackney North and regular television personality, was sacked as a public health spokesman by Miliband in his shadow cabinet reshuffle last year.

But she was recently revealed as Labour supporters’ top candidate in the next London mayoral elections fuelling speculation she will run.

She was responding to a question from chair of the local Labour branch Steve Donnelly, who said: ‘So how does it feel inside the tent Diane at the minute?’

Labour leader Ed Miliband has struggled to overcome doubts even among his own MPs that he has what it takes to be Prime Minister

Over a buffet supper and beers, she said: ‘Whoever wins will have to put up taxation if they are serious. They won’t admit it, but they have to’.

And she raised concerns about the shadow chancellor Ed Balls, saying he ‘reminds people of the Brown years, and it allows the Tories to say over and over again, ‘These were the people who crashed the car.’ But actually he is very able.’

Miss Abbott claimed today that the remarks were taken out of context, and insisted that she and most Labour MPs were very confident Labour would win next year’s election.

She said: ‘All the polls point steadily in the direction of Ed Miliband winning the election. I did say some Labour MPs are worried, but I don’t think they are a substantial minority.’

Labour currently have a 3-point lead in the polls, but fewer than one in five voters think Ed Miliband looks like a future prime minister.

Due to the way the electoral system works, however, the Conservatives will need a 6 per cent lead to win a majority next May.

Miss Abbott, who has been an MP since 1987, embarrassed Mr Miliband last year after he made a major speech on immigration.

In a newspaper article, she accused him of being too worried about opinion polls, and called on him to resist the ‘steady drumbeat of pressure’ to move to the right on the issue.
