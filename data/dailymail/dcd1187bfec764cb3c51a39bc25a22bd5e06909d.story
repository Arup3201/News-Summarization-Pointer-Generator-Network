Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen has urged Harry Kane NOT to play for England Under 21's this summer.

Kane is set for his first senior call-up later this month for the games against Lithuania and Italy.

But the plan then is for Kane to drop down back into the Under 21's for this summer's European Championships in the Czech Republic.

Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino has already warned the FA he wants talks with the FA before giving them his blessing to call-up Kane this summer.

And Vertonghen, who played in the tournament in 2007, says the 21-year-old, who has played 41 games already this season, should skip the tournament in preparation for next season.

The Belgian said: 'It’s difficult for me to judge. Of course England want him. He is a brilliant striker and he can be the main man, but I think he needs his rest for next season.

'It’s his call and I know a player always wants to play but sometimes you have to be careful. It’s a difficult one because last season I played with injuries, but sometimes you just can’t. You have to think about what’s going to come.

It’s his decision and it’s a totally different situation from when I played in 2007. Did that benefit my development as a player? It’s hard to tell.

'I enjoyed playing for my country because I never played international football at youth level.

'So that was my first tournament as a Belgium player and I enjoyed it. It was in Holland and I played in Holland for Ajax at the time, so for me it was brilliant.'
