An early morning wake-up call prank went horribly wrong for a couple of bumbling CNN anchors when they had phoned a total stranger.

Ashleigh Banfield and Zoraida Sambolin, the co-hosts of CNN’s new morning show Early Start orchestrated the prank to pull on comedian Chuck Nice in California, where it was 3:40am.

But it wasn’t Chuck Nice. It was someone else who was speaking Spanish and was extremely confused by the call.

And it was all going so well ...: The frown on the face of Early Start co-host Zoraida Sambolin (right) indicates she sensed from the get-go that something was wrong, but Ashleigh Banfield kept the joke going

As Ms Sambolin suspected that they were not speaking with Mr Nice at all, Ms Banfield kept going.

When the bumbling pair reached Chuck Nice, pictured, he revealed he had been watching CNN all along and saw the prank fall flat

'Chuck this is the FBI calling,' she said, before erupting in a fit of chuckles.

But her laughter was cut short as she finally realized they were not speaking with the comedian.

Ms Banfield asked: 'Is this Chuck Nice?' but got only silence.

Red in the face, she got up from her chair, saying: 'Know what, Zoraida, you're taking this one'.

Ms Sambolin tried to smooth things over.

She said: 'Disculpe! We didn't mean to call you so early in the morning. We apologise, whoever you are.'

Ms Banfield eventually returned to her seat in a state of disbelief. 'I totally don’t believe we just got a wrong number. Poor guy has no idea he was just on CNN'.

She
 also tried to explain away the error saying Mr Nice must have given 
them a bogus number because 'he does VH1,' where they’re 'hateful'.

The anchors tried again with a different
 number and finally reached the funnyman, who had been up and watched 
their prank fall flat.

Who is this? Ms Banfield's laughter was cut short as she realized they weren't talking to Chuck Nice at all, but to a Spanish-speaking stranger who had no idea he was on CNN

Right, I'm off: An embarrassed Ashleigh Banfield briefly got up from her chair, saying: 'Know what, Zoraida, you're taking this one'

He said: 'I'm already up and I actually happened to flip you guys on and you woke up some poor Latino guy'.

Early Start premiered on CNN just a week ago, replacing the news network's American Morning program.
