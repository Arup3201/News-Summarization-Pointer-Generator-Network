She is the star of some of the world's best-loved children's books, but as she approaches her 60th birthday Miffy the little white rabbit is to get a 21st century makeover.

Miffy was created in 1955 by Dutch artist Dick Bruna and her adventures have now sold some 85 million books which have been translated into 80 languages.

With a hugely successful toy range and last year's foray into cinema with a feature-length film, she is now worth an estimated £150m.

21st century rabbit: The much-loved Miffy books are to be revamped to appeal to a wider audience

Publisher Simon & Schuster announced a number of MIffy Books books, starting with Miffy, Miffy at the Gallery and Miffy at the Zoo will be updated 'to appeal to a modern British audience'.

Mr Bruna, 86, has always stuck to a rigid formula with the books. Most contain sixteen pages of story with one illustration and four lines of verse per page.

The last word of the second line always rhymes with the last of the fourth and they always have a happy ending.

Some books, such as Miffy's Dream, have no text at all.

Simon & Schuster have recruited award-winning poet Tony Mitton to revamp the original rhyming verse.

Simon & Schuster Editorial Director Meg Wang said: 'Generations of British children grew up with Miffy – and now as parents, are introducing this loveable and iconic character to their own children.

'Dick Bruna's stories explore the extraordinary wonder of everyday things in a child's life – which have proven to be both timeless and universal.

'We're thrilled to be bringing Miffy to a wider audience in the UK with brand new activity and novelty books, while also introducing a new generation to the classic Miffy stories through the newly-translated hardbacks.'

Mr Bruna created Miffy during a rainy seaside holiday in North Holland. He entertained his young son by sketching a little bunny in the garden of their holiday house, and making up stories about it every evening.
