A paraglider's flight turned to disaster on Sunday as he plunged 20 feet down a Hampshire cliff side, breaking his leg and sustaining serious injuries.

These dramatic pictures show emergency services scrambling to assist the stricken pilot in a tricky cliff side operation.

The unnamed man in his 50s remained conscious as he waited for rescuers to reach him on the ledge that broke his fall.

ambulance service, coastguard and Maritime Agency after plummeting 20 
feet down a cliff side in Hampshire on Sunday afternoon

He rolled over the edge of the cliff as he tried to land after soaring through the air, near Pebble Beach, Barton on Sea, Hampshire.

Specialists from the ambulance service's Hazardous Area Response team lowered the man to the ground by 7.20pm in a painstaking two hour effort before a helicopter from the Hampshire and Isle of Wight air ambulance flew him for treatment at Southampton General Hospital.

Photographer Matt Hardy, who lives nearby and witnessed the dramatic fall and rescue operation, said the man had landed in a difficult position for rescuers.

Mr Hardy, 24, said: 'When he came in to land somehow rolled down the cliff.

'He stopped about three-quarters of the way down.

'There were people everywhere.'

The man's paragliding companions were first at the scene before being joined by rapid response teams from the South Central Ambulance Service and crews from the coastguard and Maritime Agency from nearby Southbourne.

The British Hang Gliding and Paragliding Association website says that trainee paragliders undergo ten days of flying and sit an exam covering flight theory, meteorology and basic air lawÂ  to get their novice pilot's rating, which allows them to fly in their clubs around the UK.
