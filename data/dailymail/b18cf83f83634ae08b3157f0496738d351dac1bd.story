The new 'Spanish supernanny' hired by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to help them look after Prince George has been named as Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo.

William and Kate are said to be 'delighted' that the full-time nanny has decided to join their royal household

The couple's new employee will be joining them and their young son on their forthcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand - and she will have been specially trained in self defence as well as how to 'skid pan' a car in poor weather conditions.

A
 Kensington Palace spokesman said: 'Maria is a full-time nanny, who 
started work with us recently, and will be accompanying the Duke and 
Duchess and Prince George to New Zealand and Australia.

He added: 'We will not be giving further details on Maria or her employment, except to say that the Duke and Duchess are of course delighted she has chosen to join them.'

Ms Borrallo trained at the prestigious Norland College which has been producing childminders for the rich and famous since 1892.

The institution's students are known for their distinctive uniforms and are schooled in all aspects of looking after youngsters during their three-year degree course.

The training costs £36,000 in total and the college in Bath recently added martial arts training and stunt driving to its curriculum to cater for modern clients - many of whom are celebrities and the super-rich.

Tae Kwon-Do is believed to be the martial art of choice - which has been specially adapted to include how to dodge a potential kidnapped with a pram.

Nannies are also trained in how to deal with paparazzi and are taken to Castle Combe Racing Circuit in Wiltshire to perfect their driving skills and learn how to drive at high speed in any weather condition.

Driving away from pursuing photographers being the main reason for the training.

Ms Turrion Borrallo is from Spain and started working for the Cambridges a few weeks ago.

William and Kate met her before she was appointed and a Kensington Palace spokesman said the royal couple were 'happy and delighted she's come on board'.

Speaking about the tour of New Zealand and Australia he added: 'When they're out and about she will be looking after Prince George as she's been doing for the last couple of weeks.'

Earlier this month it was revealed that the couple had chosen Ms Borrallo, who was described as a 'Spanish supernanny' to help them care for baby George.

The nanny, thought to be in her mid-thirties, is believed to have worked for high-society families for two decades.

Earlier this month picture emerged of the eight-month-old prince with a childminder in Hyde Park, as his parents holiday in the Maldives.

It is not known if this woman was Ms Borrallo.

Before news was announced of Ms Borrollo's hiring, a friend of the, then unnamed nanny, told Hello! magazine: 'She has worked with other prominent high-society families in the past.

'It was from there that the Cambridges heard of her and hired her.

'She is not married and doesn't have a boyfriend as her life is totally dedicated to the family she is working with.

'She is known for being totally professional - married to the job.'

William and Kate have made clear they intend to be hands-on parents.

They have often enlisted the help of Kate's mother Carole Middleton, as well as occassionally employing William's former nanny Jessie Webb.

However, with their upcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand signalling the start of more frequent public engagements, sources claimed the royal couple were eager to secure an aide.
