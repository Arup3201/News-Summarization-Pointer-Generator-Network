A coroner demanded action yesterday after a critically ill pensioner 
died waiting for an ambulance while several crews in the area took 
‘undisturbable’ rest breaks.

Fred Pring could have survived if  his wife’s first desperate 999 call had been responded to in time, an inquest heard.

Joyce
 Pring, 63, made four increasingly frantic calls over 50 minutes after 
her  74-year-old husband was taken ill with chest pains.

'Unacceptable': Joyce Pring (left) frantically called 999 when her husband, Fred, 74, started suffering chest pains. Crews did not reach their home for 50 minutes

On her fourth and final attempt she was forced to accept: ‘It’s too late now, he’s gone.’

As
 she made the calls, six of the region’s 16 ambulances were on mandatory
 rest breaks, another eight were queuing outside two hospitals to hand 
over patients, and the remaining two were dealing with other incidents.

After
 delivering a narrative verdict, coroner John Gittins announced he was 
calling for urgent changes to reduce the risks posed by mandatory rest 
breaks and delays in dropping off patients at A&E.

The inquest 
heard harrowing recordings of the 999 calls made by the retired 
gardener’s wife at their home in Mynydd Isa, near Mold, North Wales.

Mrs Pring initially phoned at 1.08am on March 21 last year and was reassured an ambulance was on the way.

Tragedy: By the time Mrs Pring made her fourth emergency call, her husband (pictured) had died. She told the operator it was 'too late'

Half
 an hour later – and on her third call – her husband stopped breathing 
and died. She dialled 999 for the last time at 1.51am, when she said: 
‘This is the fourth time I’ve rung for an ambulance, it’s too late now, 
he’s gone.’

Mr Pring was suffering from heart disease and a chronic lung condition and died from heart failure.

The
 coroner told the inquest at Ruthin that three ambulances eventually 
reached the couple’s home, with the first ‘arriving 48 minutes after the
 initial call’.

Mr Gittins said: ‘Although it cannot be established 
with  certainty that Mr Pring would have survived if help had reached 
him sooner, it is probable that if an ambulance had arrived promptly 
after the first call, that is to say within their target response time 
of eight minutes, he would have lived long enough to be transported to 
hospital where further medical treatment would have optimised the 
prospect of his survival.’

The inquest had previously heard how one 
of the first paramedics on the scene, Michael Bennett, received a ‘red 
two’ call – the second most serious alert – at around at 1.32am.

But
 he ‘politely declined’ to help because he had been on shift for six 
hours without a break. Prior to the call he had waited 99 minutes to 
hand over a patient at Wrexham Maelor Hospital’s A&E department.

A 
short time later Mr Bennett and his colleague Vincent Clayton got 
another call requesting their help on a top priority ‘red one’ call, and
 they agreed to give up the break.

The strict rest break policy 
means paramedics must be stood down to take an ‘undisturbable’ 30-minute
 meal break once they have been working for five hours.

Delays: Paramedics had to wait 99 minutes to transfer patients from their ambulance to hospital staff, meaning a limited number of ambulances were available to attend the call

Ambulance 
service officials told the inquest that the break must be taken where 
hot food can be prepared and served, meaning paramedics cannot simply 
park in a layby to eat sandwiches.

Mr Gittins said the loss of any life to a ‘potentially avoidable delay’ was unacceptable.

He
 said he was writing to the local ambulance trust and health board to 
express his concerns that unless action was taken the risk of other 
deaths would continue.

The coroner wants to know why the system for 
prioritising 999 calls doesn’t take into account whether someone has 
been waiting for an ambulance to arrive.

Numbers: There were 15 ambulances on duty in the whole of North Wales on the night Mr Pring died

He also wants to encourage
 greater sharing of NHS facilities.

Canteens in hospitals appear not to 
be available to paramedics, meaning crews could be wasting precious time
 ‘returning to base’ for their mandatory breaks.

Professor Matt 
Makin, medical director of the Betsi Cadwaladr University health board, 
and Elwyn Price-Morris, chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service, 
issued a joint statement, saying: ‘We are taking a range of actions to 
ensure that our busy ambulances and emergency departments are available 
to those who need them most urgently.’

Joyce Pring (pictured) begged the emergency services for help for her husband, Fred

Mrs Pring:  ‘It’s my fourth call, I think my husband has just died.’

Operator asks for her full address

Mrs Pring: ‘This is the fourth time I’ve rung for an ambulance, it’s too late now, he’s gone.’

Operator: ‘Are you with him now.’

Mrs Pring: ‘There’s not much point now, he’s dead.’

Operator: ‘How old is he?’

Mrs Pring:  ‘He was 74.’

Operator: ‘Is he awake?’

Mrs Pring: ‘No’

Operator: ‘Is he breathing?’

Mrs Pring: ‘No.’

Operator: ‘Alright, what happened?’

Mrs Pring; ‘He just couldn’t take the pain anymore and couldn’t breathe anymore.’

Operator: ‘Okay, I’m organising help for you now.’

Mrs Pring: ‘There’s nothing I can do now for him, he’s just lying on the bed.’

Operator urges Mrs Pring to help her husband by laying him flat on his back on the floor.

Mrs Pring: ‘I can’t do that, there’s nobody here, he’s died.’

Operator:  ‘Are there any neighbours that can help you?’

Mrs Pring: ‘No, there’s nothing I can do, he’s dead.’

Operator: ‘I can tell you how to help him.’

Mrs Pring: ‘You’re too late, I’m sorry.’

Operator: ‘Are you wanting to help your husband?

Mrs Pring: ‘Just let him go. He was in pain, I do not want him to suffer. It’s not that I do not want to help him, he’s gone.’

Operator: ‘Let’s help him together.’

Mrs Pring: ‘I can’t he’s gone. Don’t you understand? I don’t want to get him back to suffer more.’

Operator: ‘When did he stop breathing?'

Mrs Pring: ‘Two minutes ago.’

Operator: ‘Just follow my instructions, you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do.’

Mrs Pring: ‘I just want someone to come and take him, it’s nearly an hour…What are your target times?’

Operator: ‘What do you mean…we try to get to patients as quickly as possible.’

Mrs Pring: ‘Well, you haven’t succeeded this time.’
