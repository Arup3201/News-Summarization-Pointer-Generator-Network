The highly anticipated return of ITV's Broadchurch has prompted a large increase in searches to the west country. 

An analysis of hotel searches from January 5-8 this year, compared with January 5-8 last year, have seen an increase as high as 200 per cent in some of series' production locations.

Interest in Bridport has surged by 161 per cent, while Portishead has seen the greatest spike - just days after the first episode's premiere.

Searches to West Bay in Dorset have also seen a 50 per cent increase. 

Clearly Brits aren't dissuaded by the dark content of the TV phenomenon, as hotels in both areas expect to see an increase in tourists in 2015, according to Hotels.com.

With only one episode of series two having aired so far, searches could increase further as David Tenant and Olivia Coleman unfold their latest mystery.

After all, following the first series' dramatic finale in 2013, the coastal area of Bridport saw an increase in holiday searches of 67 per cent.

Lizann Peppard of Hotels.com said: 'Broadchurch regularly attracted an average of nine million viewers per episode in 2013, perfectly showcasing this beautiful area to a huge audience.

'It is clear that Brits take travel inspiration from their favourite TV programmes, with this drama the latest to boost search figures to a specific UK location - as the series progresses, it will be interesting to see if the growth in popularity matches it.'
