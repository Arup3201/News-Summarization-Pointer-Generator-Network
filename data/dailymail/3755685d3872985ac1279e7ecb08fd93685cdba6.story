A factory has been accused of bringing in a jeweller to cut off workers' wedding rings as part of health and safety rules.

Unions claimed staff were in tears at having the rings removed, some for the first time since their wedding day.

However, the firm – Becton Dickinson, which makes sterile medical equipment and employs more than 700 people in Plymouth – said it had simply brought in a jeweller to resize the rings to make them easier to remove as part of the safety drive.

Unions claimed staff were in tears at having the rings removed, some for the first time since their wedding day. They added that workers had only agreed to the measure because they had a 'gun to their head'

A leaked memo suggests the rules have been introduced after a worker lost a finger when they got their wedding ring caught on a piece of equipment.

Dave Springbett, regional officer for the Unite union, said: 'There are women in tears, women whose husbands put that ring on their finger 20 or 30 years ago and it has never been taken off.'

He added: 'I work with plenty of people in factories who wear gloves or tape [over their jewellery], but they have said no to that. They have even had a jeweller here cutting people's rings off.' 

A memo sent out on December 15 said the new rules will come in on February 1, this Sunday, for workers in the operational, warehouse and toolroom areas, and anyone who works with equipment.

But it says stud earrings, necklaces, body piercings covered by clothing and medical bracelets will still be permitted.

While Mr Springbett acknowledged workers had been informed, he said the lack of information in the interim meant they thought the company had changed its mind.

He said: 'Apparently it's on health and safety grounds which is, quite frankly, ridiculous. There is no health and safety reason and no hygiene reason.'

Mr Springbett said that while workers have agreed to the policy, it is only because they had 'a gun to their heads' and wanted to keep their jobs. 

A spokesman for Becton Dickinson said: 'We have implemented a policy that excludes the wearing of jewellery, or any other personal items, in those areas in which they could constitute a safety risk.

'We understand that a small number of our associates may be unhappy, and we are sensitive to their feelings, but our overriding priority must be workplace safety.

'We have offered associates who were unable to remove their rings the opportunity for a professional jeweller to come to the site to resize their rings. This is entirely voluntary and the cost is being paid by BD.'
