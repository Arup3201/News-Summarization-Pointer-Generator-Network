Michael Jackson could still be alive if six 'extreme deviations' in his treatment had been avoided, a court heart yesterday.

Cardiologist Dr Alon Steinberg listed six flaws in Conrad Murray's treatment in Los Angeles Superior Court which had a direct impact on the 50-year-old 'Thriller' star's death.

Prompted by prosecutors, he described Murray's 'bizarre' behaviour in trying to revive Jackson after he stopped breathing on June 25, 2009, and his catalogue of elementary blunders in caring for the star.

On Wednesday a jury heard how Conrad Murray made a series of obvious errors in the minutes before Michael Jackson died

He told the court that Murray:

Cardiologist Dr. Alon Steinberg detailed numerous errors, including wrongly administered CPR, failure to call 911, misusing Propofol and not having proper medical equipment

'All these extreme deviations, giving Propofol in the wrong setting without proper equipment or personnel, not making proper preparations, not calling 911 in a timely manner, not keeping records, all directly impacted on Mr Jackson's life,' said the cardiologist.

'When you monitor a patient you never leave their side, especially after giving them Propofol. It's like leaving a baby that's sleeping on your kitchen counter top.

'You would never do it because there is a chance the baby could wake up and fall off or grab a knife or something. You just don't do it.

'If these deviations didn't happen, Mr Jackson could have been alive.'

Murray, 58, has pleaded not guilty to involuntary manslaughter by administering Jackson a lethal dose of Propofol to help him sleep.

But Dr Steinberg listed the medical equipment Murray should have had on hand for dealing with a potential emergency.

Murray tried giving one-handed chest compressions to Jackson as he lay on the bed, instead of using two hands on a hard surface. Either way Murray was wrong as Jackson still had a pulse when he began

They included equipment for checking his heart rate, his oxygen levels, a back-up battery, a backboard for CPR, a defibrillator to shock the heart, life-saving drugs and trained assistants.

'It is basic knowledge in America that when someone is down you need to call 911 for help. One of the first things Dr Murray should have done was call 911. There was a significant delay,' he said.

The cardiologist criticised Murray for calling an assistant rather than an ambulance.  'Every minute counts,' he added.

He added that he'd never heard of Propofol being used outside a hospital.

Dr Steinberg was testifying after Dr Christopher Rogers, the Los Angeles Deputy Medical Examiner, insisted Jackson could not have killed himself by self-administering Propofol.

He told jurors that the circumstances of Jackson's death didn't support the claim by Murray's lawyers that the singer was to blame for his own death.

'In order for Mr Jackson to have administered the Propofol to himself, you would have to assume he woke up and although he was under the influence of Propofol and other sedatives, he was somehow able to administer Propofol to himself,' said Dr Rogers.

'Then he stops breathing and all this takes place in a two-minute period of time. To me, that scenario seems less reasonable.'

Jackson could have survived had 911 been called, experts testified, who also said there is no way the pop star could have given himself the lethal dose of sedatives

Murray's lawyer, Michael Flanagan told the judge the defense was dropping the claim that Jackson may have swallowed a deadly dose of Propofol to cause his own death.

Dr Steinberg insisted that Jackson's life could have been saved if Murray called 911 the moment he discovered the star's breathing had stopped.

'He was definitely savable at that point. There was a delay in calling 911. If they had got there six minutes later Mr Jackson would still be alive,' said the cardiologist.

'He had a heart pressure and the heart was getting excited and there wasn't enough oxygen. If he had all the help and equipment that he didn't have, Dr Murray could probably have saved Mr Jackson at that point.

'He should never have started chest compressions. He should have called 911. Obviously, waiting didn't work.

'If you put all these things together, yes, he's responsible.'

He added that Murray's use of Propofol was 'unethical and untested.'

The case continues.

Botched Jackson's care after his breathing stopped, 'inexcusably' giving CPR with one hand on a bed. He should have tried to get air into Jackson's lungs after the star stopped breathing, rather than trying to jump-start his heart which was still beating. He should also have used two hands for CPR on a hard surface.

Took too long to call 911 after the pop star stopped breathing, especially since it took paramedics only four minutes to reach the scene.
