Middle-aged people who have a drink a day cut their chances of developing heart failure in later life by a fifth, claim researchers.

A US study of nearly 15,000 people found drinking up to seven drinks a week is linked with a 20 per cent lower risk of men developing heart failure in the future when compared to people who did not drink at all.

There was a 16 per cent cut in risk for women drinkers, says a report in the European Heart Journal.

Previous research has found drinking modest amounts of alcohol protects heart health, but this is the first study to look in depth at heart failure.

More than 700,000 Britons over the age of 45 live with heart failure, which occurs when damage to the heart leaves it too weak to pump blood efficiently round the body. Around 100,000 a year are thought to die from it.

Heart failure causes symptoms of fatigue, breathlessness, increased heart rate and swollen ankles, and it can lead to serious complications.

A team led by Dr Scott Solomon, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, analysed data from 14,629 people aged between 45-64 years between 1987 and 1989.

The volunteers were questioned about alcohol consumption at regular intervals.

During the 25-year follow-up period 1,271 men and 1,237 women developed heart failure.

The lowest rate of heart failures occurred in those drinking up to 7 drinks per week and the highest rate was among former drinkers.

A drink was defined as containing 14g of alcohol, equivalent to approximately one small (125ml) glass of wine, just over half a pint or a third of a litre of beer, and less than one shot of liquor such as whisky or vodka.

Former drinkers had the highest risk of developing heart failure – up to 19 per cent increased risk compared to abstainers.

There was an increased risk of death of 47 per cent for men and 89 per cent of women who reported consuming 21 or more drinks a week at the start of the study.

Professor Solomon said: 'These findings suggest that drinking alcohol in moderation does not contribute to an increased risk of heart failure and may even be protective.

'However, heavy alcohol use is certainly a risk factor for deaths from any cause.

'The people who were classified as former drinkers at the start of the study had a higher risk of developing heart failure and of death from any cause when compared with abstainers.

'This could be related to the reasons why they had stopped drinking in the first place, for instance because they had already developed health problems that might have made them more likely to go on to develop heart failure.'

Government guidelines recommend men should not regularly drink more than three to four units of alcohol a day. Women should not regularly drink more than two to three units a day.

Christopher Allen, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said 'Some studies have shown drinking small amounts of alcohol may have some benefits for your heart, but it's not just your heart health you have to think about.

'Drinking alcohol can increase your risk of liver disease and some cancers, and excess amounts can also lead to cardiovascular disease.

'There are much safer and healthier ways to protect your heart like exercising regularly and eating a healthy diet, so there's no reason to start drinking if you don't already. Anyone who is concerned about their alcohol intake should contact their GP.'
