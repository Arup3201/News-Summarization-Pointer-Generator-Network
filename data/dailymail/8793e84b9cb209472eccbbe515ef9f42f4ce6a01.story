Home loans taken on by first-time buyers are at their highest level since records began 40 years ago, according to alarming figures from banks and building societies.

Typically, young buyers are borrowing the equivalent of 3.47 times their gross household income, leaving them particularly vulnerable to any rise in interest rates, which could come later this year.

The trend appears to be at odds with the affordability tests brought in by the Financial Conduct Authority in April.

How much? First-time buyers are taking on the highest number of loans since records began 40 years ago

Its mortgage market review (MMR) has required lenders to make much more stringent checks on the income and spending patterns of buyers to ensure they can meet repayments.

In theory, these affordability tests look at everything from spending on haircuts to gambling, holidays and childcare before agreeing a loan. Many experts predicted that the review would lead to a sharp fall in new buyers and long delays in mortgage approvals.

However, figures released by the Council of Mortgage Lenders yesterday suggest this has not happened.

There were 28,600 loans adding up to £4.2billion to first-time buyers in June. This was a rise of 7.1 per cent on the previous month and 18.7 per cent higher than in June 2013.

At the same time, the average loan rose to £123,865. The June increase took the total number of loans to first-time buyers to 79,900 for the second quarter of 2014, which was up by 24 per cent on the same period last year.

Matthew Pointon, of analysts Capital Economics, said the figures ‘suggest that the mortgage market review has not slammed the brakes on lending’

The CML said the average loan in relation to income has been rising steadily over the past year from 3.33 in the second quarter of 2013 to 3.47 today.

This is the highest figure recorded by the CML since it began collecting the data in 1974. Looking at the whole property market, the CML figures show that a total of 171,000 loans for house purchases were approved in the second quarter of 2013, up by 19 per cent on a year ago.

Matthew Pointon, of analysts Capital Economics, said the figures ‘suggest that the mortgage market review has not slammed the brakes on lending’.

He added: ‘The breakdown between types of buyer shows that it is first-time buyers who are still driving the rise in lending. There is no evidence that the mortgage market review has tightened up lending criteria.’

Mr Pointon said an increase in interest rates would put a strain on those carrying big mortgages. ‘That said, we only expect interest rates to rise very gradually next year,’ he added. 

During past property booms, some young buyers were borrowing five or six times their income, while others effectively invented a claimed income in order to borrow huge sums under so-called self-certified mortgages.

However this was always a minority and the mean figure for all first-time buyers was generally around three times income.

Paul Smee, of the CML, said the review had not had the effect anticipated by many in the industry. He added: ‘For the second month running since new FCA rules took effect, lending characteristics remain similar to the market beforehand.

‘We now feel confident that, as we would hope, the MMR effect is more gentle dampener than hard brake.

‘As we recently suggested in our revised forecasts, lending levels should continue to increase modestly over the course of the year, driven mostly by house purchase but with remortgaging also recovering.’ 

Getting the right mortgage is essential to making sure buying a home is as affordable as possible.
