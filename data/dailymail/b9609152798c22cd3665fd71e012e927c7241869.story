A crowd of strangers will make 'life-changing decisions' for volunteers in a new Channel 4 show.

The Audience will feature a group of 50 ordinary men and women who will answer important questions such as 'Should I leave my job,'  'Should I start again and move abroad?' and 'Should we get married or split up?'

The jury will follow the person posing the problem around for a week in a bid to get to know them – including at work, at home and when they are socialising, before making a decision.

Golden questions: A crowd of strangers will make 'life-changing decisions' for volunteers in a new Channel 4 show

Sometimes they will quietly observe from a distance, but at other times they will be able to ask questions.

The programme makes say the crowd will 'delve into people's personal circumstances and uncover problems to inform a picture of their lives and how to improve it.

David Glover, the Channel 4 executive who commissioned the series, said: 'Sometimes I used to daydream about what 
life would be like if one were constantly being followed around by an 
audience. This series has huge potential and we are now waiting to see 
how the ‘wisdom of the crowd’ unfolds.' 

The producers promise that 'heartache, resistance and personal revelations,' will all feature in the programme.

The
seven-part series, is due to air later this year and comes from the 
same team behind the award-winning series 24 Hours in A&E.

Executive
producer Jonathan Smith added: 'We're finding, during filming, that 
living with an audience of 50 people for a week is an incredibly intense
experience. Although they can sometimes be cruel to be kind, they 
really do want to help - and we're seeing lives change for the better as
a result.'

Channel 4 are hoping the new format 
will be as ground-breaking as Big Brother which ran for 11 series, 
generating £88m in profits.

Another much-hyped concept, their docu-soap Seven Days, which followed a cross-section of Notting Hill residents had disappointing viewing figures.
