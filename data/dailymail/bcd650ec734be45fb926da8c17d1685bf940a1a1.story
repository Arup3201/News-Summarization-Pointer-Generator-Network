Ray Winstone said that he had 'no regrets' over tax avoidance and might leave Britain to avoid being 'raped' by its high taxes.

Winstone, 56, told students at the Oxford Union on Wednesday night: 'I did not pay taxes for 20 years. I got away with it.'

The People reported that he confessed to them: 'I was spending more than what I was earning. But I was a young fella. I did not understand the tax law.'

Winstone also told the students they did not need to be afraid of going bankrupt.

'All it means is, you can't have a business or a bank account. 
So f****** what? The second time they made me bankrupt, they did it for 
£28,000, just to make an issue of it.'

He said that after being plunged
into bankruptcy in the eighties he decided to 'knuckle down and go to work.'

However, he is still keen to avoid paying the top rate of tax.

His revelations at the Oxford Union followed his tax rant on radio 
last week.

It emerged that he was using a loophole to save 
nearly £100,000 of income tax.

He put nearly £350,000 of his £1.4million earnings for the year to April 2012 down as 'administrative expenses'.

The actor, who is well-loved for films 
such as Sexy Beast, Scum and Quadrophenia, reportedly paid 
£265,379 in corporation tax through his firm Ray Winstone Ltd.

By putting his tax affairs through a 
company, he is able to pay corporation tax at a rate of 26 per cent 
instead of at the higher income tax rate.

Comedian Jimmy Carr recently backed down 
after he was criticised for using legal loopholes to reduce his tax 
bill, but Winstone discussed his opinions of the British tax system 
frankly.

Last week he told talkSPORT Radio that the taxman was ‘taking too much in exchange for too little. I love this country but I’ve had enough.'

Winstone then threatened to leave the UK altogether to escape being 'raped' by taxes.

This would put him in a similar situation to French film star Gerard Depardieu, who left France for similar reasons.

Depardieu had a public row with the French government over tax, accusing it of penalising success, and now has Russian citizenship, and an investment firm in Belgium to give him a lower tax bill.

High earner Richard Branson has also waded in on the debate, but he does not believe anyone should be leaving Britain for tax reasons.

Branson told the Telegraph: 'Actually, it is a very reasonable system, especially if you compare it to a country like France, where it is 80 per cent for some high earners.'
