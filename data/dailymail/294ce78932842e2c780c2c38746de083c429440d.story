If you thought his party-loving days were over – think again. Prince Harry attended an aristocratic friend’s wedding where hotel staff say he fell asleep at the bar and lost his wallet and iPhone.

The Prince celebrated the wedding at the secluded, five-star Chateau Bela hotel in Slovakia, where for two nights he downed cocktails, was seen flirting with a mystery brunette and stayed up until 6am.

Harry’s ex-girlfriend, Chelsy Davy, 28, was among the guests, and reportedly remained at his side for most of the weekend as well as splashing around with him in a swimming pool.

Carrying on till morning: The picture, taken by a person at the wedding in Slovakia, shows the Prince, at about 6am, as he appears to be following the mystery brunette, who is wearing a flowing, dark-green skirt and a sleeveless black top

Our exclusive picture, taken by a person at the wedding, shows the Prince, at about 6am, as he appears to be following the mystery brunette, who is wearing a flowing, dark-green skirt and a sleeveless black top.

In the grainy image, Harry, 29, who had his white shirt hanging out, seems to gesture at another young woman to join him and the unidentified brunette.

In other photographs seen by The Mail on Sunday, the Prince was pictured talking to the two women while three male guests stand around and three others sit drinking and smoking at white tables on the hotel grounds.

The Prince was attending the wedding of his friends Alexander Mavros, 34, and Alexandra von Krockow, 29, earlier this month near Sturovo, 100 miles east of the capital Bratislava.

He was among 250 guests who included business tycoons as well as members of some of the most aristocratic families of Europe.

After arriving at the hotel on Friday afternoon, the Prince spent the early evening enjoying a barbecue accompanied by local gipsy music.

The Prince and his friends then went into the hotel’s main oak-panelled bar, and ordered rounds of Bloody Mary cocktails and rum and Coke.

A waiter, who didn’t want to be named, said: ‘The bar was open all night, and they just ordered Bloody

Marys, ten, 11, at a time. It was so busy. Harry also liked rum and Coke, and he ordered vodka as well.’

Following the first night of partying, reports appeared in Slovakian newspaper Novy Cas – which published the main picture above – and in the Hungarian newspaper Borsonline.hu. They claimed that the Prince fell asleep in front of a bus at the hotel and in the bar.

When asked if Harry fell asleep at the bar in the early hours of Saturday morning, a barman replied ‘yes’, and then quickly changed the subject.

Following the wedding on Saturday, Harry and his friends danced and drank until late at night. When they left a salon room, Harry forgot his wallet and iPhone on a table.

Luckily, waiter Stephan Csonto, found them and returned them to him after rifling through the wallet and finding Harry’s name on his HSBC bank card.

He said: ‘When I returned it to the Prince he was happy and thanked me and shook my hand.

‘I knew it was Harry’s as I had seen him with the same wallet before. He puts it on the table when he sits down.

‘He told us that the best thing about the wedding was that he could be himself, and nobody bothered him because he was Prince Harry.

Mr Csonto continued: ‘He was so funny. He drank a bit during the wedding, but they all drank.

‘The English, they like to drink at parties. But he was having such a good time. He also told us he had never been to Slovakia before. He spent a lot of time with Chelsy, but they seemed to be good friends,’ he added. The main bar closed at 6am, and Harry and some other guests, including Ms Davy, went into the front courtyard of the hotel.

A barman added: ‘I was about to drive off, and Harry was out in the grounds with friends.

‘He then jumped in front of my car with his arms stretched, shouting, “Arghh.” He then told me, “Don’t go, don’t go!” It was funny. His handprint is still on my windscreen.’

Brunch for the guests was served at 11am on Sunday, after which everyone gradually departed.

It is believed that London-based Mr Mavros, a scion of a Zimbabwean jewellery dynasty, has been friends with the Prince for about three years.

Harry caught a Ryanair flight from Bratislava on Sunday afternoon, bound for Luton.

The bride’s mother, Countess Von Krockow, said yesterday: ‘Harry had a good time.

‘Of course people were a bit tipsy at the wedding – that’s what happens.’

The 47-room Hotel Chateau Bela is one of Slovakia’s most famous historic hotels.  Once the seat of the von Krockows, it is still owned by the family.

Prince Harry stayed in a standard en suite double room on the first floor, costing about £90.

Buckingham Palace refused to comment about the wedding weekend, as it was a personal matter.
