The New York City Police Department is reviewing a video in which a man is seen being choked and punched by a police officer at a subway station in Harlem as the officer is trying to take him into custody.

The video, which was recorded during the unidentified man's July 14, arrest, comes nearly a week after a Staten Island man died after he was put in a similar choke hold by an NYPD officer, and the city's police commissioner ordered that all of the NYPD's 35,000 officers be retrained in use of force policies and techniques.

In the video, two officers can be seen wrestling the man to the ground, at which point one of the officers put him in a choke on two separate occasions, all while repeatedly punching him in the face.

Choked: Video shows the unidentified officer choking a suspect in a subway station as he was trying to take him into custody

Stop resisting: The officer repeatedly tells the suspect to 'stop resisting,' as is often the case when police know they are being recorded

Punches: As the officer was choking the man, he repeatedly punched him in the face

Blood: Bystanders were screaming 'you busted his nose' as blood began to splash on the ground beneath the man being taken into custody

'You busted his nose!' bystanders on the video are heard yelling.

According to DNAinfo.com, the video was anonymously sent to East Harlem community activist Rev. Kelmy Rodriguez.

'I was appalled when I saw this video, 
especially after the Eric Garner situation,' Rodriquez told the publication. 'Something 
like this adds more gas to the fire.'

Disturbing video footage shows Garner, who was accused of selling illegal cigarettes, struggling on the pavement saying 'I can't breath' before passing out. 

NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton said Garner's death was 'very tragic' and ordered Deputy Commissioner of Training Benjamin Tucker to conduct a 'top-to-bottom' review of officers' training. 

Victim: Eric Garner, 43, died after being held in a 'chokehold' by NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo in Staten Island. An initial report into his death has said he was 'not in great distress

According to the New York Daily News, Bratton is looking for inspiration from the Los Angeles Police Department's 'state of the art' training which was set up after the immigration rallies in 2007.   

The commissioner, who met with FBI officials following Garner's death, said he anticipated a civil suit by the family and 'would not be surprised if the U.S. attorney 'decides to open a civil rights violation investigation.'

An initial report into Garner's death released earlier this week did not mention a chokehold, claiming he 'was not in great distress' and his health 'did not  get worse' as he was held down.

The omission has sparked an angry reaction from City Hall, with state senator Bill Perkins shouting: 'This is murder' during a rally. 

In the video of Garner's death, veteran officer Pantaleo waved to the camera as the father was taken away on a stretcher.

One of the witnesses asked, 'Why is nobody doing CPR?' an officer responded, 'Because he's breathing.'

Sergeant Dhanan Saminath said Garner was in handcuffs with officers 'maintaining control of him' according to the report.

It also suggests that he 'resisted arrest' and failed to 'obey instructions' as police tried to handcuff him. 

However Sergeant Kizzy Adonis said she 'believed she heard the perpetrator state that he was having difficulty breathing'. 

The New York City Medical Examiner's office has not yet been able to determine what killed Garner - whether he died from a chokehold or an underlying health issue. 

Pantaleo, a plainclothes cop, has been forced to surrender his gun and badge and put on desk duty while the NYPD investigates the case.

Treatment: A witness asked why no one was giving him CPR, to which officers respond 'because he is breathing'  

It has also 
been revealed that he has seven civil rights lawsuit against him - 
including allegations of illegal strip searches and arresting men who 
were 'committing no crimes' at the time.

One
 resulted in the city paying $30,000 to two men who were unlawfully 
strip-searched. The other lawsuit, which is still pending, alleges an 
unlawful arrest. 

Garner's grieving son, meanwhile, has called for the New York Police Department officer who was filmed putting his father in a chokehold to be arrested and thrown in jail. 

This isn't the first time Pantaleo has been accused of abusing his police powers, the Staten Island Advance reports. The eight-year veteran officer has had two civil rights lawsuits filed against him.

The first was the result of a March 2012 traffic stop in which Darren Collins and Tommy Rice were arrested and then strip-searched in broad daylight on a Staten Island street. 

Gwen, Mr Garner's mother, said she was glad the incident was recorded so police could not shy away from what happened.
