Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma has been rewarded for his fine form with a call-up to Didier Deschamps' French squad.

Zouma was dubbed the new Marcel Desailly by Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho after an impressive performance against Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley.

And the 20-year-old’s form this season has clearly caught the eye of Deschamps who brings the former Saint-Etienne man in to his squad.
