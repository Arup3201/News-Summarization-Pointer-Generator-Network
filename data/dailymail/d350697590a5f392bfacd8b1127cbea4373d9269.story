Lipstick ban: Flight attendants on Turkish Airlines have been ordered not to wear red lipstick or nail polish in a move attacked as 'too religious'

Female flight attendants at Turkey’s national airline have been banned from wearing red lipstick and nail polish, prompting renewed fears from secular Turks the country is becoming more Islamic.

Turkish Airlines, Europe's fourth-biggest carrier, said the ban was aimed at keeping crews 'artless and well-groomed with makeup in pastel tones' because a natural look improved communication with passengers.

But critics say it reflects the creeping influence of the government's Islamic values.

The new rule will be imposed just one 
year after the airline lifted its ban on headscarves among its staff.

‘This new guideline is totally down 
to Turkish Airlines management's desire to shape the company to fit its 
own political and ideological stance,’ Atilay Aycin, the president of Turkish Airlines' worker's union, said.

‘No one can deny that Turkey has become a more conservative, religious country.’

Turkey is 99 per cent Muslim, but the NATO state and European Union candidate has a secular constitution.

There have been concerns in recent years that an increasingly wealthy but pious middle-class is emerging in Turkey that wants to practise its religion more freely.

Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party, which traces its roots to a banned Islamic party, has also come under strong pressure from grassroots supporters  to relax the state's control over the expression of religion.

Such restrictions were aimed at reining in Islamism and improving women's rights, but effectively prevented many devout women from studying at university or taking government jobs.

Mr Erdogan, whose wife Emine wears a headscarf, has previously said he is committed to secularism, but does not believe it should be at the expense of those who want to express their religious beliefs.

Turkish Airlines defended its new rule, 
saying: 'As a consequence of our current cabin uniforms not including 
red, dark pink, etc., the use of lipstick and nail polish in these 
colours by our cabin crew impairs visual integrity,'

It sent social networks into a frenzy, with many women posting pictures of 
themselves with red lips in protest.

One wrote: ‘Why not just ban stewardesses altogether so we can all breathe a sigh of relief?’

Some male Twitter users were indignant over the insinuation that red lipstick would induce a sexual frenzy.

'They are objecting to the lipstick and 
nail polish that we have been using for years,' said Asli Gokmen, 30, a former Turkish Airlines' 
flight attendant who lost her job with more than 300 others last year 
during a union protest.

No current employees were available for comment.

Turkey's Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said he is committed to secularism

Turkey has remained a secular consitution since the modernising reforms of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who threw religion out of public life in the 1920s and 1930s as he rebuilt Turkey from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire.

The powerful military views itself as the ultimate guarantor of Turkey's secular order and has ousted four democratically elected governments in the past 50 years, most recently in 1997 when with public support it drove out a cabinet it viewed as too Islamist.

The current government, led by Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, is run by the Muslim AK party which has its roots in a banned Islamic movement.

He is currently serving his third term as Prime Minister heading the conservative faith based Justice and Development Party, also known as the AK Party.

He founded the AK Party in 2001 upon his release from prison where the former mayor of Istanbul, served ten months for reciting an illegal Islamist poem during a public address in the province of Siirt.

As he was banned from public office following the speech including the poem, he could not become Prime Minister when the party won the general election in 2002, a ban which was lifted in 2003.

However, under Erdogan’s leadership the country has relaxed restrictions on religious expression, including lifting the ban on head scarves in courts and schools.

Turkish
 Airlines passenger Ahmet Yerli, 33, said he did not think the new 
guideline was a sign of creeping Islamisation but that the ban was still
 ‘absurd.’

‘I've never heard of a plane crashing because of a women's lipstick,’ he said before his flight.

The company caused a stir earlier this year after mockups of a new Ottoman-style uniform were leaked online.

The uniform for stewardesses, which 
featured loose-fitting ankle-length dresses and fez-style hats, were 
criticised for being too conservative and were branded 'a joke' by 
Turkish designers, saying they misrepresented the country.

'The
 clothes look like they belong to Kuwait or Saudi Arabian Airlines. 
However, they should reflect Turkey and Turkey is not this,' designer 
Vural Gökçaylı told Hurriyet Daily News.

In response to the critique, Turkish Airlines said the design was not the final product and the conservative uniform never materialised.

Islam is the main religion in Turkey 
with 99 per cent of the population identifying themselves as Muslim, 
including those who define themselves as secular with a Muslim 
background.

Despite 
this, the tradition of wearing a headscarf, a practice associated with 
Islam which is followed by many Muslim women, is banned in a majority of
 jobs in Turkey.

Turkey's
 constitution prohibits women working in the public sector, such as 
lawyers, teachers, or anyone working on state premises, from covering 
their head - a ban which and until 2008 also applied to university 
students.

In 2007 
Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, head of the moderately Islamic AK Party, 
tried to lift the ban, but was stopped by Turkey's Constitutional Court 
which ruled that removing the ban was against the founding principles of
 the constitution.

However, Prime Minister Erdogan, who won
 the 2007 promising to scrap the ban, said last month he did not believe
 constitutional change was needed to abolish the ban on headscarves in 
the public sector.
