Indian police have arrested a man who tried to blow up the house belonging to the driver of a Delhi bus on which a 23-year-old was gang-raped, as lawyers refuse to defend the accused rapists.

A man was arrested on Monday after he was found with two homemade bombs outside the house of bus driver Ram Singh in south Delhi's RK Puram area. Two other men escaped arrest.

Hearings are expected to begin on Thursday at the Saket district court 
in south New Delhi, where police will formally present a 1,000-page 
charge sheet against Singh and five others accused of raping the victim on December 16.

'We have decided that no lawyer will stand up to defend the rape accused as it would be immoral to defend the case,' Sanjay Kumar, a lawyer and a member of the Saket District Bar Council, told AFP.

It comes as the Indian government proposed to name a revised anti-rape law after the victim, a move her family referred to as an 'honour'.

The father and brother of the girl said that 'if the government names the revised anti-rape law after her, we have no objection and it would be an honour to her'.

Kumar said the 2,500 advocates registered at the court have decided to 'stay away' to ensure 'speedy justice', meaning the government would have to appoint lawyers for the defendants.

Five men are expected to face charges including rape, murder and kidnapping in the Saket court, with the prosecutor likely to seek the death sentence.

A sixth suspect is believed to be 17 years old, meaning he would be tried in a juvenilesâ€™ court, but police are conducting bone tests to determine his age.

The rape victim died at the weekend after 13-day struggle to survive 
injuries so severe that the majority of her intestines had to be removed.

She
was gang raped and violated with an iron bar on a bus before being thrown from the moving vehicle at the end of a 
40-minute ordeal.

Aware: The body of the tragic student victim was cremated amid tight security, police said

As protests about violence against women grow 
louder in India, a 17-year-old school student has come forward to claim 
she was sedated and raped by two men in the upscale south Delhi colony 
of Safdarjung Enclave on New Year's Eve.

The two men in their late 20s were arrested and sent to Tihar Jail.

The
men, identified as Rajesh and Naveen Jain, work in IT companies, police
said. They were arrested Monday night and sent to Tihar after they were
produced at the Saket court.

The victim had met one of the accused on a social networking site. She
met the man on Dec 31 at a south Delhi market and then asked her to 
accompany him to a flat in Safdarjung Enclave. There he was joined by 
his friend, police sources said.

The two are then said to have 
sedated her and took turns in raping her. They also warned her of dire 
consequences if she revealed anything.
