Mesut Ozil needs special treatment because he's 'sensitive', according to Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho.

Speaking as Yahoo’s Global Football Ambassador, Mourinho said that Arsenal's midfielder, who play for him at Real Madrid, 'needs trust' if you want to get the best out of him.

Ozil joined the Gunners at the beginning of last season, and was widely praised for some of his early displays.VIDEO Scroll down to see Ozil and Podolski film martial arts video

But injuries and fatigue followed, and he was on the end of some significant criticism as the campaign came to a close.

‘I think it's hard to criticize him, because Özil is Özil,' said Mourinho.

'If you were expecting Özil to be super aggressive and to be running miles and miles from side to side and to show great enthusiasm and aggressiveness, this is not Mesut.

‘If you are waiting for somebody where every time he touches the ball, the ball smiles.

‘Every time he makes a pass, the ball goes with the right direction, the right speed, the right intensity, this is Özil.'

The 25-year-old is currently at the World Cup with Germany, where he played a key role in the 4-0 demolition of Portugal in their opening game.

But the former favourite amongst German supporters was booed off in their unconvincing home win over Chile in March.

Mourinho added: 'At the same time, I learned with him because we were together for quite a long time, that he's a very sensitive boy. He needs confidence. He needs trust. He needs to feel that people is with him. When he's on the pitch, every time he touches the ball, the ball goes beautiful.

'And he’ll always finds the right man on the right place. So, sometimes, you don't see him, sometimes he doesn't go to screen many, many times. But when he goes he is a special player.'
