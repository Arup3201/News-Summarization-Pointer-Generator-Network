A staggering 221 new species were discovered in 2014  by one US institution alone, including a tiny elephant shrew with a distinctive 'trunk'. 

The list of new species include 110 ants, 16 beetles, three spiders, 28 fish and 24 sea slugs.

It was compiled using 64 scientific papers published by the California Academy of Sciences.

Nice to meet you: A total of 221 new species were discovered in 2014, including a tiny elephant shrew. The new species of round-eared sengi,  was found in the remote deserts of Namibia, in south western Africa. It is the smallest known member of the 19 sengis and was called Macroscelides micus

The animals were discovered in remote caves, at the bottom of the sea, in deserts and even in the heavily populated state of California.

‘Biodiversity scientists estimate that we have discovered less than 10 per cent of species on the planet,’ Dr Meg Lowman, the Academy’s Chief of Science and Sustainability said.

The new species include 110 ants, 16 beetles, three spiders, 28 fish, 24 sea slugs, two marine worms, nine barnacles, two octocorals, 25 plants and one mammal. Pictured is a poison-loving sea slug

Entomologists found and described 110 new species of ants on the biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar. One species of note was the Malagidris sofina, or the ‘hero ant,’ (pictured) which lives in non-porous clay, and is thought to build a striking, funnel-like nest to promote oxygen exchange and protect its colony from suffocation

The Etendeka round-eared sengi, or Macroscelides micus, was found in a remote part of the Namid Desert in south western Africa.

It is the smallest of all elephant shrews or sengis.

The animal is the third new species of sengi to be discovered in a decade.

It has rust-coloured fur, a large, hairless gland on the underside of its tail and lacks dark skin pigment.

Genetic analysis showed important differences between this specimen and close relatives.

Sengis are restricted to Africa and despite their small size, are more closely related to elephants, manatees (known as sea cows) and aardvarks than they are to true shrews.

‘Academy scientists tirelessly explore the unexplored regions of Earth - not only to discover new species, but also to uncover the importance of these species to the health of our natural systems.

‘Our findings help to sustain the future of life for our children and grandchildren. Even in our own backyards new discoveries abound.’

Among the discoveries was a new species of round-eared sengi, or elephant-shrew, which was found in the remote deserts of Namibia, in south western Africa.

It is the smallest known member of the 19 sengis and was called Macroscelides micus.

Experts now know that the creatures are restricted to Africa and despite their small size, are more closely related to elephants, manatees  - known as sea cows - and aardvarks than they are to true shrews.

Entomologists from the Acdemy found and described 110 new species of ants on the biodiversity hot spot of Madagascar. 

One species of note was the Malagidris sofina, or the ‘hero ant,’ which lives in non-porous clay, and is thought to build a striking, funnel-like nest to promote oxygen exchange and protect its colony from suffocation. 

Catch of the day: A gigantic deep water worm eel, called Pylorobranchus hearstorum is the largest of its kind found off the Philippines measuring nearly 50 inches (127cm) from head to tail - almost twice as long and three times heavier than any known worm eel

the tropical forests and reef-filled waters of Southeast Asia have yielded three newly discovered ray spiders, which are each about the size of a single grain of sand. This image shows the web of one of the tony creatures

It also exhibits a defensive behaviour known as ‘cliff-jumping’.

This is when a lone hero ant breaks from the colony and sacrifices itself to tackle an intruding foreign ant approaching the nest entrance by grabbing it and throwing it – and itself – dramatically over the lip of the nest, meaning the insects tumble to their death.

Also among the finds are 65 new species of marine creatures, including a type of 23-million year old megamouth shark identified by its fossilised teeth.

A total of 20 new species of gobies, one cardinalfish, one toadfish, two grenadiers, one yellow damselfish, one pipefish, 24 colourful nudibranchs, two octocoral, nine new barnacles, two marine worms, and a ghost shark from New Zealand were also found in 2014.

A gigantic deep water worm eel, called Pylorobranchus hearstorum is the largest of its kind found off the Philippines measuring nearly 50 inches (127cm) from head to tail - almost twice as long and three times heavier than any known worm eel.

It is related to snake eels and probably lurks at depths close to 1,000 feet (305 metres) beneath the ocean’s surface.

And the tropical forests and reef-filled waters of Southeast Asia have yielded three newly discovered ray spiders, which are each about the size of a single grain of sand.

Two were discovered on dormant Philippine volcanoes while a third was discovered in the forested hills of Malaysia.
