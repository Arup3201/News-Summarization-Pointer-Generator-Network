Pleased: The mother of a 6-year-old child who received an amended birth certificate looks at the new ID with the change in gender of her child

Argentina has granted a female identification card to a six-year-old boy who has been dressing like a girl for two years.

Lulu
was born a boy named Manuel, but the young child has never identified 
as such and has referred to herself as a girl all her life.

On Wednesday, he received an amended birth certificate and a new ID with the change in gender.

It's the first case of a gender 
change on a document for a minor in Argentina since the approval of the 
country's groundbreaking gender-identity law last year.

The law lets people change their names and sexes on official documents without first getting approval from a judge or doctor.

Her mother Gabriela says her child's new name is Luana.

After receiving the documents, she thanked those who, in her words, 
'trusted the identity of my daughter' and 'respected her rights.'

She has now been given new registration papers by the Buenos Aires provincial government, listing her as a girl.

According to her mother Gabriela, Lulu
chose the gender as soon as she first learned to speak and has insisted
on being called Lulu since she was just four years old, local media 
reported.

Last year, 
Argentina put in place liberal rules on changing gender, allowing people
to alter their gender on official documents without first having to 
receive a psychiatric diagnosis or surgery.

The term transgender refers to people who identifies with a different gender to that which he or she was born as.

The
term transgender includes those who refer to themselves as transsexual,
trans, genderqueer etc. as well as both those who go through gender 
reassignment surgery and take hormones and those who simply see 
themselves as a different gender but do not want to go through any form 
of therapy or physical change.

Identifying
as a different gender as the one which you were born into is called 
gender dysphoria and in order to legally change identity in many 
countries, a psychological diagnosis of gender dysphoria is needed.

With the passing of the
Gender Recognition Act in 2004, British transgender are allowed to 
apply to the gender recognition panel for legal recognition of their 
acquired gender.
