Three students at a suburban New York City high school have been suspended for allegedly posting racial tweets following a tense basketball playoff game against a rival school.

Officials say it happened after Mount Vernon defeated Mahopac on February 27. Students and school officials say scuffles erupted between the fans in the stands and the racial slurs were posted afterward.

Among the posts, which have since been removed, was one that stated: 'That's why you shouldn't let monkeys out of their cages #mtvernonzoo'

Tense game: Last Thursday, Mt Vernon faced off against their rival, Mahopac, in a playoff game

Tough crowd: Some fans who came to support Mt Vernon were overheard taunting Mahopac cheerleaders and threatening them with violence

Mount Vernon Mayor Ernest Davis condemned the incident. He says the district planned to meet with state education officials to prevent such incidents in the future.

Mahopac School Superintendent Thomas Manko says three students whose tweets were verified have been suspended. He says students will be given sensitivity training so they understand why they can't use such words.

According to Manko, tensions ran high during the game last Thursday, which ended with Mount Vernon's victory over Mahopac 43-40, CBS New York reported.

The top-seeded Mount Vernon team is made up mostly of black players.

Messages of hate: Following the tense game, some Mahopac students took to Twitter, putting up racist posts aimed at their rivals from Mt Vernon

According to Manko, some of the blame for the ugly incident rests in part with Mount Vernon fans, who were heard taunting Mahopac cheerleaders and threatening them with violence, MyFox New York reported.

A grainy YouTube video posted by user iGr8Dane shows a scuffle that broke out in the stands between warring fans.

The animosity between the two rival schools boiled over on Twitter that night when a number of Mahopac students unleashed a torrent of racially charged posts.

'Tough loss boys but at least we can talk to our dads about it #mountvernon,' one of the tweets read.

Another user wrote: ‘One of the few biological Mount Vernon fathers just tried to sell me crack outside the county center.’

One student allegedly posted a picture of a Confederate flag.

‘It just reminded us once again that racial intolerance is still on the agenda,' Mount Vernon Interim Schools Superintendent Judith Johnson said. 'It’s often the elephant in the room.'

Mahopac's head coach Kevin Downes, who is black, later admonished students from his school on Twitter, saying that it 'makes it hard to coach there #disappointed.'

Ninety-five per cent of students at Mount Vernon High School are minorities, compared to only 11 per cent at Mahopac, according to U.S. News & World Report.

Disciplined: Three students from Mahopac High School have been suspended

Superintendent Manko told News 12 Westchester the trio of Mahopac students who have been suspended in the aftermath of the incident will be banned from taking part in school activities as punishment for their online outburst.

Mahopac officials are also investigating whether players from their team made racist comments to Mount Vernon students as the two teams shook hands at the end of the game.

'We will not tolerate the bestiality and racism that has existed too long in this country,' Mount Vernon Mayor Davis said at a news conference. 'A bodacious outpouring of insults hurled at our future generation.'

On Wednesday, Mount Vernon scored another major victory, beating
Newburgh Free Academy 66-48 in a semi-final.
