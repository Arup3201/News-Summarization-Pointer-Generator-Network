Any Spanish players upset by a perceived lack of commitment from Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas will get another chance to win without them on Tuesday night against an understrength Germany side in Vigo.

Coach Vicente del Bosque told Spanish radio station Onda Cero: ‘It could be that when Costa and Fabregas come back another player has taken their place. That is not a threat, it’s just reality.’

Del Bosque’s comments were a reference to the storm that blew up ahead of Spain’s 3-0 Euro 2016 qualifying win over Belarus on Saturday when Sergio Ramos said: ‘I just wish players had the same level of commitment to the national team as they do with their clubs.’

Some players were said to be unhappy, particularly with Costa, who had made himself unavailable for the Spain squad but then played in Chelsea’s win at Liverpool the following day.

Captain Iker Casillas attempted to draw a line under the affair yesterday saying: ‘I am sure that the commitment from the players here and from those that haven’t come is the maximum.’

Germany are waiting on the fitness of Real Madrid’s Sami Khedira, who will captain the side if he recovers from an ankle knock.

Asked if this match could act as revenge for the way Spain beat Germany at Euro 2008 and the 2010 World Cup, midfielder Mario Gotze said: ‘Revenge? Why? We are the World Champions.
