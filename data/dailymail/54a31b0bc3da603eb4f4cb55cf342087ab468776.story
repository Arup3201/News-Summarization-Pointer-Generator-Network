Vladimir Putin is as dangerous as Joseph Stalin and much more of a threat to world peace than ISIS, a former defence secretary has claimed.

Bob Ainsworth said Mr Putin was more powerful than the jihadists in the Middle East because he had a strong state and military to achieve his ambitions.

The senior Labour MP called for the Government to launch an urgent review of its military cuts and take a much stronger line against Russian expansionism.

Russia's president Vladimir Putin (left) could become as dangerous as Second World War dictator Joseph Stalin (right), according to the former defence secretary Bob Ainsworth

Mr Ainsworth’s remarks come after Prince Charles likened Mr Putin to Hitler during a trip to Canada.

The MP made his stark assessment in an article for a Birmingham public affairs website called the Chamberlain Files.

He said: ‘No leader of a major power has behaved as overtly aggressively since Stalin in the postwar period, and sadly Putin would be very pleased with the comparison.

‘He has said the demise of the Soviet Union was the greatest tragedy of the 20th century and he claims the right to act on behalf of Russian minorities in other states.

‘As there are Russian minorities throughout the old Soviet Union and far wider he is in principle claiming the right to interfere in the affairs of all of the independent sovereign states of eastern Europe.

‘Stalin's policies pushed the world into the cold war. Putin has the potential to be equally as dangerous.’

Mr Ainsworth, in remarks published in the Times, said Europe needed to reduce its reliance on Russian energy.

He said: ‘The prime minister told the House of Commons recently there is no need to look at the strategic defence review of 2010 despite the fact that large scale cuts are still being imposed on our armed forces.’

The former defence secretary said: ‘We have an army stuffed full of the kind of vehicles best suited to fight a counter insurgency in Afghanistan, not those likely to offer reassurance to our European neighbours facing a Russia that is re-equipping its own forces.

‘These capabilities cannot be altered simply or quickly. All party agreement should be sought for a new review now, this side of the election, to look at what can be afforded and the kind of training and equipment needed in the face of the new scenario.’

Mr Putin - watching the launch of a missile during naval exercises in Russia's Arctic North on board the nuclear missile cruiser Peter the Great - has ramped up military spending, threatening eastern European states

The hard-man president has played up to his macho image to win support. Joseph Stalin rose to prominence as an enforcer for Vladimir Lenin

Mr Cameron slashed defence spending by 10 per cent in 2010 – but has vowed to increase the military budget between 2015 and 2020.

Last week, Gerald Howarth, a former coalition defence minister, called for a new comprehensive strategy for dealing with security threats arising from Ukraine, the Middle East and north Africa.

He said: ‘Since we completed our strategic security and defence review in 2010, fundamental changes have taken place across north Africa, the middle east and Ukraine.

‘Nothing calls more for a really serious new strategic defence and security review than the state of affairs at the moment.

‘I hope that the Foreign Office, the Ministry of Defence and other government departments will put time and effort into producing a strategy.’
