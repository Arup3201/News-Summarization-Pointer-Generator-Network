Lucas Leiva has admitted he is open to a move away from Liverpool and could join Napoli in search of regular football.

The Brazil international has only featured seven times for Brendan Rodgers' side this season with his current deal at the Merseyside club ending in 2017.

The 27-year-old nearly joined Napoli in the summer, a move which would reunite him with former Liverpool boss Rafael Benitez in Serie A.

'Is it possible that Lucas could leave Liverpool in January? Yes, naturally. Lucas likes Rafael Benitez a lot. After all, the two know each other well from when the Spaniard was coaching Liverpool,' Lucas' agent Henrique Coelho told Calciomercato.com.

Having only made two Premier League starts this campaign Lucas has revealed he is open to a move away with limited playing time under Rodgers.

'I must think about leaving as there is no room for me at Liverpool,' Lucas told Radio Marca.

'I'm not speaking to anyone at the moment because I'm under contract, but I am looking around, given I am not playing.

Lucas, being replaced by Steven Gerrard, is open to a move away from Anfield to gain regular football 

'There was contact with Napoli last summer, but the parties didn't reach a satisfactory agreement. The situation at Napoli was not advantageous for everyone but despite that, I know Rafa Benítez has always had a lot of faith in me.

'I want to play but at the same time, I need to be patient. I need to find a solution, be it at Liverpool or some other club. In the past there were rumours linking me to Atlético Madrid, but there was nothing concrete,' Lucas added.

Lucas has fallen down the pecking order behind captain Steven Gerrard, Jordan Henderson and Joe Allen in the Liverpool midfield this season, despite their slow start.
