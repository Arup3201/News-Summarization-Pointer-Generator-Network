Championship clubs spent over £14million on agents fees last season, with play-off winners Queens Park Rangers topping the bill.

Harry Redknapp's side paid over £1.8million to players' representatives in the 2013/14, on their way to reaching the Premier League thanks to a Bobby Zamora goal at Wembley.

Unsurprisingly three of the league's four lowest spenders were relegated, with only cash-strapped Blackpool (£10,000) paying agents less than Yoevil Town (£61,550), Doncaster Rovers (131,380) and Barnsley (£221,445).

Well worth it: QPR may have spent a lot of money on agents but it paid off when they won the play-off final

In the money: Bobby Zamora's strike at Wembley ensured Rangers more than made their money back

However Leicester City and Burnley showed that big spending is not always needed to get results, between them paying out under £700,000 and finishing first and second respectively.

The other sides to splash the cash were Blakcburn Rovers (£1,681,080), Wigan Athletic (£1,460,460) and Reading (£1,656,446). Between them the four biggest spenders account for 45 per cent of the Championship's total output to agents.

Expenses: Charlie Austin, signed from Burnley, was one of 11 players brought in last season

Costly: Blackburn Rovers were the second highest spenders, DJ Campbell one of their 13 signings

In total the Football League spent 18 per cent less last season than the previous year, but agents still raked in an average of over £32,000 per transfer in the Championship.

According to the Football League's Chief Executive, Shaun Harvey, the reduction was a result of the league's new Financial Fair Play regulations. 

However, he stressed that the more than £17million spent on agents was still 'a very significant sum leaving the game'.

Who needs money: Leicester City won last season's Championship despite just £343,900 on agents' fees

 'The 2013/14 campaign was the first season against which sanctions will be applied in all three of our divisions under The Football League's Financial Fair Play rules. It is therefore notable that we have seen a significant fall in payments to agents. 

'Hopefully this is a sign that they are having a positive effect but it's too early to know for definite at this stage. 

'Whilst a reduction of £4m is welcome there is still a very significant sum leaving the game to pay agents.'
