A Spanish woman who drowned in a vat of wine after becoming intoxicated by fumes has been pictured for the first time. 

Wine specialist Nerea Perez was watching the fermenting process at the cellar in the Spanish village of Salas de los Barrios, in the north west of the country.

The 25-year-old is understood to have been overcome by the fumes given off during fermentation, which caused her to lose her balance and fall into the vat of wine.

Difficult: The emergency services - were called to scene by Ms Perez's uncle Raul - were unable to save her and only managed to retrieve her body 

Emergency services were called to scene by Ms Perez's uncle Raul - himself a well-known winemaker, who is understood to have discovered his niece drowning in the vat in his warehouse.

The emergency services were unable to save Ms Perez, however, and were only able to retrieve her body.

The emergency services also had to give assistance to members of Miss Perez's family, who were said to be overcome with grief after the incident.

Colleague Ginebra Peralta Colunga, 32, said: 'Now is the time for harvesting grapes so a lot of villages around here have people working on stirring the wine in the barrels.

'This is the first time this has happened though.'

Perez was a political figure in the local town's Young Socialists group, who paused their campaigning for a day as a mark of respect for the woman after her death was announced. 

Alvaro Gerarfo Courel, the district secretary of the party told the website: 'We regret the loss of a member of the Bierzo, a companion, which is made more painful by the circumstance and her youth.

'We will show deepest sympathy and send a big hug to her family, friends and the Socialist Youth of Bierzo.'

Wine makers say accidents such as this are more common than many people think, due to the strength of the gases given off by wine while it is fermenting.
