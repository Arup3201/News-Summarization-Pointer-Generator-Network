A woman in Perth has employed a unique tactic to sell her used car, claiming that it would be suited to a feminist' and that it comes with a recommendation for a 'Ryan Gosling-style mechanic'.

Perth-based lecturer in gender studies Chantal Bourgault posted an advertisement on community classifieds website for her 2005 Holden Viva, and after receiving no interest, decided to amp up her marketing strategy.

'I just put a regular boring ad on Gumtree, and didn't get any responses and so I thought that I may as well try something different,' Ms Bourgault told Daily Mail Australia.

Ms Bourgault recommends a mechanic called Kevin, who is 'gorgeous' and Ryan Gosling-esque in philosophy

She said it was just 'how she thought, so it came easy', and enjoyed writing the ad as she was unwell earlier in the week.

'I have lots of like-minded friends, and I posted it on Facebook and many of them shared it. It's now outgrown me,' Ms Bourgault said.  

Advising that the car 'would suit [a] feminist', Ms Bourgault highlights several features of the car which would empower men or women interested in gender equality.

Ms Bourgault says in the ad that she bought the car, which shows 'demonstrable continuity, so no need to worry excessively about generations, waves, or postfeminism'.

She explains that the car has done 150,000 kilometers and has a new timing belt which means that 'there is sufficient mileage here to support a realistic appraisal of the status of women, but still plenty in reserve to 'keep going', as Thelma once said to Louise.'

Her recommended mechanic Kevin won't patronize women who employ his services, or 'mansplain', a term meaning men who offer opinions on topics they know little about.

'Manual controls and power steering are also beneficial for the modern feminist driver, as the features would allow the prospective buyer to 'empower [themselves] by retaining full control over [their] decisions on the road to equality', and would ensure they could 'rise above essentialist arguments about women's physical limitations.'

It would come as a given that Ms Bourgault would have a special interest in feminism, given that she is a lecturer in gender studies and English.  

'I guess I know that world well, and so was able to write to it. It's a really hard market at the moment, and I do really want to sell it,' she said.

Her recommended mechanic Kevin, who she says is 'gorgeous' and brimming with Ryan Gosling philosophies, won't patronize women who employ his services, or 'mansplain'.

'It’s a popular culture feminist word used to describe the experience of having a man explain something  to you that you already know, or even know more about than him,' Ms Bourgault explained.

'It can also mean that a man offers an opinion on something he doesn’t know much about,' she said.

'A lot of the time they are just responding to societal expectations, but it can be problematic in workplaces, as cultural habits can often silence women and perpetuate bad patterns.'

Her mechanic is also close to the University of Western Australia, so prospective buyers of the car 'can read Judith Butler in the library while he works'.

Ms Bourgault said that Jamie was always very sensible and straight-talking, spoke to her like an equal, and was just a very good mechanic. 

She said that one of the reasons she wrote the ad using feminist rhetoric was because she was aware that feminists were often depicted as humourless.

'I always try to retain my sense of humour when I engage in feminist theory,' she said.

'One of the nice things about the ad was that I was setting the agenda for the conversation. It wasn't 'oh, is feminism dead?' 

In explaining why she was selling her car, Ms Bourgault ends her ad with a nod to feminism in pop culture, poking fun at her satirically whimsical and well-worded classified.

'In the context of Time magazine's campaign to make feminism defunct, I have decided to upgrade to the newer and more powerful HeForShe model as endorsed by Hermione,' she quips. 

Ms Bourgault said that 'mansplaining' is 'built on social and cultural expectations of men that they are the authority and show expertise. I'm sure for many men it probably comes as a burden'
