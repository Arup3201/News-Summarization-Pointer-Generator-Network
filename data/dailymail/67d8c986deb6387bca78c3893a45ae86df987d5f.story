A car carrying a group of four young people burst into flames after it left the road in a horrific crash that claimed all their lives.

Bruno Vaccarezza, 19, is believed to have been driving at high speed when he lost control of the vehicle which flipped over a guardrail before it was enveloped in a fireball.

Pictures from the scene in Greenburgh, New York, show the terrible aftermath of the collision with the front wheels pushed back to where the front doors of the car should be.

His passengers were named as Fernanda Gomez, 19, Juliana Restreop, 18, and Vincent Mendoza, 20.

The three teenagers and 20-year-old were killed when the rented car they were travelling in slammed head on into a bridge abutment and burst into flames

Police are investigating what caused the accident which occurred on the Sprain Brook Parkway early yesterday morning.

State Police investigator, Joseph Becerra, said: 'We're not ruling anything out at this time.

'Part of the 
investigation is to determine if the operator lost control or was going 
too fast.'

Police identified Bruno Vaccarezza, from Greenwich, Connecticut, as the driver of the rented Volkswagen which the other three passengers who where from Port Chester, New York, and Norwalk,Connecticut.Â 

New York State Police Major, Michael Kopy told ABC news yesterday: 'Clearly
speed is going to be a factor. There was significant damage. The 
vehicle went off the road, and struck the abutment head on'.

Police at the scene said speed had played a factor in the accident which caused severe damage to the car and killed its four passengers

Major Kopy added there was no immediate evidence to suggest drugs or alcohol as a factor in the crash, but more analysis was needed.

Bruno Vaccarezza, 19, was driving the rented Volkswagen when it crashed and burst into flames killing three other people

Police also reported finding no signs of skid marks on the nearby pavement.

The accident took place on the Sprain Brook Parkway in Greenburgh, just 20 miles north of New York City.

Though no one witnessed the accident, a woman who later passed the scene called police to report the massive blaze at around 5.20am yesterday.

Firefighters put out the flames roughly 20 minutes later, but all four of the car's young occupants were dead.

Police have suggested the car may have been rented because he had been involved in a previous accident in his own vehicle.

The 19-year-old motor enthusiast posted several photographs and videos of cars on Facebook, including a YouTube video clip entitled 'Craziest Car Wreck EVER', which shows a vehicle slamming into an overpass on a busy road.

Another post from March of this year called 'Crazy Cop chase' shows a police car pursuing a quad bike at high speed.

Photographs reveal Mr Vaccarezza was selling two quad-bikes similar to the one depicted in the video.
