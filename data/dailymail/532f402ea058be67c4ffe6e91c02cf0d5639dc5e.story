'It was a legitimate sword that was seized...it was a weapon,' he said.

This comes amid reports a second Australian jihadi died during airstrikes that killed Australian Islamic State kingpin Mohammad Ali Baryalei in Syria.

A third Australian ISIL fighter told The Australian that Abu Noor al-Kurdi – who is believed to have used the name 'Abu Nour al-Iraqi' when he appeared in a video titled There Is No Life Without Jihad - was killed in Kobane.

A spokeswoman for Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop said the government was trying to substantiate reports of his death.

On Monday night, Mr Gaughan said he refused to apologise for the terror raids in September because law enforcement groups had information to suggest a terrorist attack was imminent.

'What we'll see now is more raids like we saw in Sydney because the environment has changed,' he said.

Mr Brandis told an audience in Bankstown more than 15 Australians had been killed in the conflict in northern Iraq and Syria where the Islamic State have been waging war

He refused to comment on whether there were current preparations for raids.

The officer also rejected claims the raids were 'overkill', saying future operations could yield similar results with only one or two arrests.

He denied the terror laws were used only for Muslims, saying a Caucasian Christian had been prosecuted in Brisbane for trying to fight in West Papua, Indonesia.

Meanwhile Mr Brandis revealed 71 young Australians have fought in northern Iraq and Syria while 73 people have had their passports cancelled to prevent them from joining the conflict.

The attorney-general appeared on Q&A where he took questions from the Muslim community and others concerned about recent terror laws and raids and the implication for civil liberties.

Mr Brandis told an audience in Bankstown more than 15 Australians had been killed in the conflict in northern Iraq and Syria where the Islamic State have been waging war.

Audience members included prominent Muslim community leader Imam Mohamad Abdalla and Lydia Shelley of the Muslim Legal Network.
