A mysterious hero in an LA Dodgers cap who carried an elderly man from the flames of his burning house has been unmasked as a local truck driver.

Thomas Artiaga carried 73-year-old Robert Wells from his flaming home in Fresno, California on Saturday.

Video of the dramatic rescue showed bystanders panicking outside the house, as flames stream from the building.

As Mr Wells's family shouted desperately for help, Artiaga was pictured emerged from the apartment building with Mr Wells slung over his shoulder - but left the scene soon after to avoid attention.

But his heroism caught up with him when he was honored last night on the Jimmy Kimmel show, and given the chance to make the first pitch for his beloved Dodgers at a game this weekend.

Sat in the audience with his wife Hannah, the father-of-three was surprised to be hauled onstage and presented with an LA Dodgers Jersey and a signed baseball by former manager Tommy Lasorda.

The Dodgers legend praised Artiaga's 'selfless heroism' as he shook his hand and offered him the chance to open the game this weekend.

Speaking to local news earlier in the week, Artiaga described his actions as 'instinct'. He revealed that he was passing by in his truck when he saw the blaze, leaped out and plucked the stricken Mr Wells from his backyard and carried him to safety.

He told ABC News: 'It's just an instinct - you see something and you help out people.'

On Kimmel's show last night, Artiaga elaborated, telling how he could feel the heat from the blaze as he carried Wells away. He laughed off suggestions that he was a serial do-gooder who wears a cape at weekends.

Reunion: Days after the destructive blaze, Artiaga met with Wells again, who thanked him

Describing Mr Wells's reaction to the rescue, Artiaga simply said: 'Yeah's he's happy about it.'

The two met in calmer circumstances earlier this week when Artiaga made a visit to the hotel where Wells is staying with his family after their home was destroyed.

He said: 'I'm glad you was there. I don't know where you were coming from or what, but I'm glad.'

Firefighters say the Saturday morning blaze started in the garage of the Fresno apartment, where Wells lived with his daughter, granddaughter and great-grandson.

Aftermath: The apartment was destroyed by the powerful fire on Saturday

Flames quickly spread. Wells is frail and relies on oxygen tank to breathe.

Wells' daughter, Roberta Francis, 51, escaped to the street, where she shouted for anyone to help her father still inside.

Meza, 40, was working on a nearby apartment and heard her cries. Artiaga was in the neighborhood helping an elderly friend with yard work when he saw the commotion. 

Firefighters arrived soon after the rescue and put out the flames that caused an estimated $100,000 in damage. Wells was taken to a local hospital for treatment and later released.
