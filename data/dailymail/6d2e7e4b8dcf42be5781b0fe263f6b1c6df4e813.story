A Chinese woman has claimed she was left with a scratched eyeball after her iPhone 5 exploded.

The phone user,  surnamed Li from Dalian, said she felt that her iPhone was hot after talking on it for 40 minutes.

She said that when she tried to end the call on the touch screen phone it was unresponsive and then it exploded at the top right hand corner, cracking the screen and sending particles of the device into her eyes.

Li said that she bought the phone last September and had dropped it on one occasion, leaving the phone with a small crack on its upper right corner, reported Want China Times.

Last month it was claimed that an air stewardess was killed by an electric shock when she answered a call on her iPhone 5 while it was recharging.

News of the death of Ma 
Ailun, 23, was posted on the internet by her sister, prompting criticism
 of Apple among the country’s millions of iPhone users.

‘I want to warn everyone else not to make phone calls when your mobile phone is recharging,’ her sister wrote.

Miss Ma, who was due to marry in 
August, was said to have bought her iPhone 5 in December from an 
official store in her home town in Xinjiang province.

Her brother told a Hong Kong newspaper the phone had been handed to Chinese authorities for examination.

There were also safety warnings about 
the millions of cheap copycat phones and chargers on the market. Apple 
products sell out quickly in China, the demand fuelling the factories 
churning out fake iPhones, iPads and iPods.

In 2011, 22 fake Apple stores were uncovered in one Chinese city, Kunming, alone.

Apple promised to investigate the death – a blow for the technology company in its second largest market after the US. 

It declined to say if it was investigating an isolated case or if it was considering a product recall.

The safety scare is the latest incident to blight the company’s reputation in China.

In April, Apple apologised to Chinese
 consumers and changed iPhone warranty policies, following criticism of 
its after-sales service.

Two years ago conditions at some of the factories making Apple products were blamed for a spate of  worker suicides.

Miss Ma's brother, Yuelun, told Apple Daily that the family believe she died from an electric shock while answering a call and that the phone and its accessories have been handed over to the Chinese authorities.

Her sister then wrote on social networking site Weibo: 'I want to warn everyone else not to make phone calls when your mobile phone is recharging.'

She said Ma had bought the iPhone in December at an official Apple store 
and was using the original charger to recharge the phone when the 
incident occurred.

Apple, said it had launched a 'thorough 
investigation', adding: 'We are deeply saddened to learn of this tragic 
incident and offer our condolences to the family.

Apple's mobile gadgets have a generally good safety record with few serious defects reported since the first generation iPhone was launched in 2007.

However, as smartphones become more powerful, with larger batteries needing more electricity to power them, there have been growing reports of dangerous malfunctions that have dogged the firm in recent years.

February 2013 - Marketing manager Shibani Bhujle, from New York, claimed the battery of her iPhone 4S spontaneously melted, oozing acid that destroyed the handset.

January 2013 - An Oregon fire crew blamed an apartment blaze on an overheated MacBook battery which dropped onto a mattress.

December 2011 - An iPhone 4 reportedly began 
emitting smoke in a plane cabin on a flight to Australia.

December 2011 - It was reported that an iPhone 4 was 
plugged in to charge overnight in Brazil when it began to emit smoke and sparks as
 its owner slept nearby.

November 2011 - Apple recalled all 
iPod Nanos amid fears the batteries on older models were prone to 
overheating and catching fire.

In 2010, a man in northeast China 
was killed by an electric shock when making a phone call with a handset 
that was being recharged with an unauthorized charger, according to the 
China Consumers Association.

In 2008 a 
3G owner claimed his phone overheated in his pocket and burned his leg 
while he was asleep.

But Apple is not the only smartphone maker to have come under fire for allegedly faulty gadgets.

A Swiss teenager suffered second and third degree burns when her Samsung Galaxy S3 apparently exploded in her pocket.

In May, a Reddit user posted pictures on the site of his charred Galaxy S3, claiming he was 'awoken by a loud noise and a 
weird squeaking sound' to find it smouldering by the side of his bed.

'We will fully investigate and co-operate with authorities in this matter.'

China’s popular social media chat 
sites, called Weibos, were flooded with posts urging fellow iPhone users
 not to make calls while charging their phones.

And many warned to only use original chargers and avoid plugging in cheap copy chargers which are widely available.

'Be sure to select only qualified, certifiable  products -  the best is the original because safety is most assured. Don’t buy fake chargers!' warned poster Zhao Chao.

Apple products are  popular in China but new items are quickly cloned by the country’s infamous copy merchants who produce look-a-like fake phones, laptops, iPads and iPods, which are often hard to distinguish from originals. 

Mobile phones have a relatively low 
electrical output of between 3 to 5 volts - much less than the 36 volts 
it takes for a person to feel a shock.

But experts say if the charger or the circuit has a problem, such as a broken wire, it can lead to a shock of 220 volts.

Johnny Sin Kin-on, a professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, told the South China Morning Post: 'There is a risk using an electrical device while its installed battery is being charged, be it a shaver or a phone.'

The iPhone 5's much-vaunted launch 
last September saw thousands of Apple fans queue for days outside Apple 
stores across the world to be the first to get their hands on the 
state-of-the-art gadget.

Grinning customers were greeted with 
cheers and high fives from staff as they walked into stores ready to 
grab the latest hotly-anticipated smartphone.

It costs between £529 and £699 in the UK and $199 and $399 in the US, depending on the amount of memory, has a
larger screen and is lighter and slimmer than previous models.

The news comes as it was revealed today that Apple has fallen off the top ten list of best-perceived brands 
in 2013.

The tech firm - known for its trailblazing innovation - lost its charismatic front man Steve 
Jobs in 2011 and then faced a chorus of disapproval over allegations of child 
labor in its supply chain, not to mention long-reported harsh conditions
 in its Chinese factories.

Most recently, the brand was convicted on
Wednesday of conspiring to raise and fix the price of e-books in an 
attempt to dominate the market leader, Amazon.
