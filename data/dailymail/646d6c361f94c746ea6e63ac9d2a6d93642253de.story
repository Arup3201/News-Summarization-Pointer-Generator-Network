Jailed: Kelly Harrison, 30, was sentenced to 27 months in prison for actual bodily harm and false imprisonment

A drug-fuelled girl gang who turned on their friend torturing her for four hours, threatening to cut off her fingers, pour acid in her face and dump her body in a river has been jailed after they posted pictures of the horror attack on Facebook.

Terrified Becky Miller, 21, was tied 
to a chair, and was slashed, burned with a cigarette lighter and kicked 
in the ordeal in Birkenhead, Merseyside, which has left her scarred for life.

Her four tormentors laughed as their victim screamed and begged to be freed and at one point the mother-of-one was told she would 
'never see her baby again' because her body would be dumped in a river.

She was also made to clean-up her own blood from the floor after being punched in the nose.

Liverpool Crown Court heard the four girls were so obsessed with 
Facebook they instantly posted shocking photos of the crime on their 
social networking sites.

But their pride over what they had done became part of their downfall after the images were used to help put them behind bars.

Unemployed Jocelyn Keating, 21, her 
cousins Ashleigh Gray, 20, and Kelly Harrison, 30, and Marie Frank, 22, 
showed no remorse when they appeared in the dock.

They have been jailed for a total of seven years for actual bodily harm and false imprisonment.

The attack in February last year has left Miss Miller afraid to go out and needing psychiatric counselling.

The court heard that trouble flared on a 'night in for 
the girls' which descended into a fight after several hours or snorting cocaine and drinking vodka and brandy.

After the attack Miss Miller only managed to escape after a row broke out between the gang and she fled, cowering behind a car.

Former shop-owner Harrison had invited Keating and Gray to her £175,000 flat in East Float Dock in Birkenhead where, with Frank, they spent the evening drinking and taking drugs with Harrison's four-year-old daughter Precious was asleep in another bedroom.

Miller arrived at the flat when Harrison and Gray picked her up from Liverpool when they were returning from picking-up more cocaine for the second time that night.

Jurors heard how Harrison's sister, 
who was not named in court, complained she had been 'jumped' while on a 
night out, blaming Miller for the attack.

After spending several hours drinking and taking drugs 'the atmosphere changed' for the worse at around 3:30am and there was a fight between Miller and Jocelyn Keating.

Attackers: Jocelyn Keating, 21,  left, was jailed for 22 months, whilst Marie
 Frank, 21, right was sentenced to 20 months, both for actual bodily harm and 
false imprisonment of Becky Miller, 21, at a house party in 
Merseyside

Prosecution counsel Mr Neville Biddle QC said: 'Miss Miller was begging to call a taxi and to be allowed to go home.

'But she was punched in the nose by Ashleigh Gray who made her clean the floor of her own blood before Jocelyn Keating dragged her around the floor. Kelly Harrison then slapped her and she heard someone say 'cut her fingers off'.

'There was an attempt to tie her up and she was told she would never see her baby again and one of the 'fellas' was coming round to pour acid on her face.

'Keating then took pictures and posted them on Facebook before she and Gray burned the jacket and her hair. Miss Miller told police 'they just kept burning me and burning me'.'

As the attack continued Miss Harrison and Miss Frank laughed as threats were made on their victim's life, as she screamed and begged them to let her go.

Frank was reported to have said: 'If I kill you I would get away with it because I'm a schizophrenic.'

Miss Miller managed to escape at 7:30am when an argument erupted between her tormentors, she fled the flat and cowered behind a car where she used a mobile phone dial to 999 but before police arrived another resident came to her aid.

Miss Miller was too scared to go near to the flat but when officers arrived they arrested the four women, despite their attempts to clear-up incriminating evidence.

Crime scene: The four-hour ordeal took place at Kelly Harrison's flat in East Float Quay in Birkenhead

In the 16 months since the attack she has been too frightened to go out socially and is scheduled for psychiatric counselling.

Each of the defence counsels told Judge Graham Morrow QC that the four felt 'remorse' for what took place and pleaded for leniency, saying they had troubled pasts.

At their trial Miss Harrison and Miss Frank were convicted on charges of causing actual bodily harm and false imprisonment. Miss Keating, Miss Gray, pleaded guilty to similar charges.

Sentencing them Judge Morrow QC said: 'Keating and Gray did most of the attacking and Frank did the least but Harrison it was your flat and your daughter was there.

'Each of you embarked on a campaign of mindless and atrocious violence which forced your victim to genuinely fear for her life. I can sum-up your crime simply - you tortured her.

'While you witnessed Miss Miller giving evidence I saw that you showed no emotion. There is only one sentence to impose and that is a custodial one.'

Keating, who pleaded guilty, was jailed for 22 months, while Gray was sentenced to 21 months detention in a Young Offenders Institute.

Harrison was jailed for 27 months and Frank was sent down for 20 months.

A restraining order was also imposed prohibiting any of them, friends, or agents from contacting their victim Miss Miller for five years.
