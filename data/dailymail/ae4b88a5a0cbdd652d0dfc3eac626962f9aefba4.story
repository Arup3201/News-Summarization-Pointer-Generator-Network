Arsenal will launch a January swoop for Ipswich star Tyrone Mings.

The 21-year-old has earned rave reviews from Gunners scouts and boss Arsene Wenger needs to bolster his defence next month after injuries left his squad exposed. Mings plays at left back but Arsenal see his future as a central defender.

The stumbling block is Ipswich’s asking price of £10million but Arsenal hope to compromise. Crystal Palace and Chelsea are also interested. 

Tyrone Mings is being tracked by several big Premier League clubs, with Arsenal leading the chase

Meanwhile, Arsenal goalkeeper Damian Martinez believes he can challenge Wojciech Szczesny as the club’s No 1 — after revealing he was ready to leave the club.

The 22-year-old kept his third clean sheet in a row in their win against Southampton. But Martinez feared for his future after Arsene Wenger signed David Ospina in the summer.

Martinez said: ‘I spoke to my agent and family and they said “let’s wait to see if you get the opportunity”. I got the opportunity, so I am really pleased.’

Asked if he could be Wenger’s first-choice, he said: ‘Yeah, Wojciech has got the spot when he is not injured.

‘Hopefully if I get a chance against Stoke, I will keep a clean sheet and we win.’
