Jake Ball is rugby’s equivalent of ‘the beard to be feared’ and on Saturday, when the bewhiskered Welsh lock faces Australia, his former home country, he will be hoping to do damage at the Millennium Stadium.

It is not just the facial hair that allows 23-year-old Ball to share a nickname with Moeen Ali, the England cricket all-rounder.

The Scarlets forward also has an impressive cricketing pedigree. At the age of 18 he was considered to be one of Australia’s brightest prospects and was offered a place at Brisbane’s Centre of Excellence.

Born in England, Ball emigrated from Berkshire to Perth with his family in 2006. It seemed that any hopes of a rugby career had been forgone to pursue a livelihood in Test cricket. He was mentored by former Test cricketer Geoff Marsh but got cold feet when a professional contract was put on the table.

‘I was a slinger so I was quite an unusual style,’ said Ball. ‘At 17 I clocked around 82mph. I played with the Marsh boys (Mitchell and Shaun) and I do miss the bowling but I hated standing in the field.

‘I was a tail-end batsman so I spent quite a lot of time sitting around. I realised I didn’t want to go down that path in the end. I’d had enough of cricket and missed my rugby so I went back and played some club games.

‘It’s probably the aggressive side of the game (that rugby offers over cricket). I was a bit over the top when playing cricket — I didn’t like getting nicked over the slips and all of that. I tried to keep my cool. Sledge? No, I was more of a quiet angry man.’

Western Force subsequently picked him up but then released him because he did not meet the standards.

A second opportunity arose with the Super 15 franchise where Ball eventually played alongside current Australia internationals including Matt Hodgson and Ben McCalman.

That opened the door to a return to Europe and, in 2012, the 6ft 6in and 19st 1lb giant agreed a three-year deal with the Scarlets in Wales, where his father grew up in Pwllheli.

Ball’s physicality suited the style of play in the northern hemisphere and the abrasive battle between the forwards.

‘I think I preferred it because it’s a lot more close-quarters in Europe,’ said Ball. ‘It’s more pick and go through the breakdown. I love the breakdown side of the game and I think the game suited me massively.’

Wales coach Warren Gatland rewarded Ball’s club performances with an international call-up for the 2014 Six Nations. Ball made his international debut off the bench against Ireland and then broke into the starting XV when Luke Charteris and Bradley Davies were injured. Ball has been named alongside Alun Wyn Jones in Saturday’s line-up, having risen up the pecking order and earned the confidence of the selectors.

‘To be selected without someone going down injured is big for me,’ said Ball. ‘I got my two starts in the Six Nations when Charts and Brad went down so to get picked was a goal of mine.’

Jones and Ball will be the engine room in a physical set of Welsh forwards in Cardiff. They will be tasked with attacking Australia up front to try to force a dangerous Wallaby back-line to play on the back foot.

Wales must also raise the pace to keep up with the tempo set by their visitors. Attack coach Rob Howley says GPS tracking systems show a Welsh player in an average club game covers 55 metres per minute. An Australian will cover nearly 50 per cent more ground at 75-80m a minute.

To combat that, Gatland has been turning up the heat in training to ensure his players are at their physical peak. There have been 6.30am wake-up calls and up to three sessions of cryotherapy a day.

‘It’s been a pretty brutal couple of weeks,’ said Ball. ‘We’ll gain the benefits from that in the game. I’d say it’s as tough as anything I’ve done. We’ve been up early and in the altitude chamber, which isn’t my favourite place.

‘I think running fitness has been something I’ve spent a fair bit of work on. When I first came into camp, the running side of things — some of the tests — were very different for me. I’d never really done that before so now I’m starting to get my foothold there.’

It will be fast and frantic this weekend; the days of standing around in the field will seem like a very long time ago.
