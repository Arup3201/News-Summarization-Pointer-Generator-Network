eBay has announced plans to turn online payments giant PayPaul into a separate company, months after being told to do so by activist investor Carl Icahn.

The online marketplace said the spin-off, set for the second half of 2015, was decided because the two giant internet businesses are now 'less advantageous' packaged together.

eBay has owned PayPal, which is growing rapidly, since 2002 when it bought out what was then a public company. PayPal now accounts for around 40 per cent of eBay's total revenue.

Announcement: eBay CEO John Donahoe, left, announced the move this morning. It was first suggested by investor Carl Icahn (right), who reportedly made $180million when the stock jumped after the news hit markets

Icahn, an activist investor and one of the richest men in America, put pressure on eBay to separate out PayPal in April - but was firmly rebuffed by CEO John Donahoe, until the u-turn today.

eBay's stock price climbed more than 10 per cent in response to the news, reportedly making Icahn $180million richer in a single move.

Donahoe said the move was a result of 'a thorough strategic review' rather than a simple acceptance of Icahn's demands.

He said: 'A thorough strategic review with our board shows thatkeeping eBay and PayPal together beyond 2015 clearly becomes less advantageous to each business strategically and competitively.'

Separation: eBay announced today it will spin off PayPal into a separate business, having owned it for 12 years. Pictured are the company's headquarters in San Jose, California

According to Business Insider, Icahn, who owns 2.48per cent of eBay, made $180million on his 30million eBay shares as their price jumped $6 each following the announcement. 

After the tax-free spinoff to shareholders, the new eBay
will be headed by Devin Wenig, president of eBay Marketplaces
and former head of the Markets division of Thomson Reuters Corp
.

American Express Co executive Dan Schulman joins
PayPal immediately as president and CEO of PayPal after the
spinoff, the company said.

Donahoe and Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan will oversee
the separation and serve on the boards of both companies.

Giant: PayPal, the online payments service, now accounts for around 40 per cent of eBay's revenue

PayPal was founded in the late 1990s and went public in
2002. It was acquired by eBay soon afterward for $1.5billion.

The PayPal business faces competition from Google Inc's Google Wallet and a number of other vendors. Apple Inc is scheduled to enter the online payments market next month with its newly unveiled service, Apple Pay.

'On PayPal, investors will still contemplate the risk of PayPal directly competing with Apple Pay and Google Wallet, which will likely add some uncertainty to PayPal's standalone valuation,' PiperJaffray analysts said.

PayPal has more than 152 million active users and accounts grew 15 percent last quarter.
