With its wings skimming across the water, this super yacht soars above the competition.

Its state-of-the-art design means the world's fastest yacht can clock an amazing 60 miles an hour - and reach 50mph in just ten seconds.

The Hydroptere, which uses marine and aeronautic technology, relies on giant wings to almost fly across the water.

Pictured in these gorgeous photos taken off of the French coast the yacht, which weighs 7.5 tons, it's easy to see why the powerful boat has broken so many world records.

Hold on to your hats! Almost literally flying across the water, this is the world's fastest yacht which can clock an amazing 60 miles an hour

Causing waves: The Hydroptere is an experimental sailing hydrofoil designed by French yachtsman Alain Thébault

The boat is meticulously studied while it is sailing - a hundred sensors measure the pressures, the twisting and the speed to make minute adjustments

The crew can be seen on the super speedy yacht as it dashes across the water. In in full flight only 2.5 square metres of the boat are in contact with the water

The boat's overall length is 22.78m (74.7 ft) - compared to the average British flat, which is 7.8m (25.7 ft).

The length of the floats is 6.7m (22 ft).

It spans 24m (79 ft) and the height of the mast measures 28 meters (92 ft).

The Hydropthre weighs 7.5 tons and the bindings that maintain the crossbeam can withstand 48 tons of strain.

The crew has just 10 m² living space in the central hull.

Maximum sail area in flight is 560 m² - much bigger than new UK one bedroom flats, which measure on average 76m.

In 2005 it sailed across the Channel faster than Louis Bleriot flew over it in 1909.

The super yacht is an experimental 
sailing hydrofoil designed by French yachtsman Alain Thibault and in 
full flight only 2.5 square metres of the boat are in contact with the 
water.

This means that it can shoot from 20 to 45 knots (23mph to 51.5 mph) in just 10 seconds.

Named after the Greek words for water 
and wing (hydros and ptere) the yacht uses the same principles as an 
aircraft to give it flight.

To take off, Hydroptere has 'marine wings', the foils, which are placed under each of the floats of the trimaran.

Once the boat reaches 10 knots, these 
immersed 'wings' deploy at 45 degrees in the water and generate an 
upward thrust which raises the boat like the wing of a plane.

Then the hull and the floats of 
Hydroptere fly five metres above the sea surface and as in the air, the 
higher the speed, the greater the lift.

When fully extended, its carbon fibre sails and mast reach 28m high - the same height as the Christ the Redeemer statue (minus the feet) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Over years of trial and error the 
designers came up with a unique shape to optimise the sail efficiency 
and minimise air friction.

The boat is made strong by the use of carbon fibre impregnanted with epoxy and titanium parts.

It's overall length is 74.7ft - three times longer than the average one bedroom British flat.

It's sail area in flight measures 560 m² - much bigger than new UK one bedroom flats, which measure on average 76m.

They
also installed a hundred sensors which measure the pressures, the 
twisting or the speed which is analysed in a flight simulator to make 
minute adjustments.

The design and the wings mean that the 78-feet long yacht can shoot from 20 to 45 knots (23mph to 51.5 mph) in just 10 seconds

To take off, Hydroptere has 'marine wings' - the foils - which are placed under each of the floats of the trimaran. The crew has just a small amount of room in the hull - but will undoubtedly want to be perched on the wings, where they can enjoy the view

Whizzing by: The initial model was made in 1985 and, 20 years later in 2005, it broke its first record

The Hydroptere earned the world record after sustaining a speed of 52.86 knots (97.90 km/h or 60.83 mph) for 500 metres in 30 knots of wind.

She later broke the 50 knot barrier for a nautical mile with a speed of 50.17 knots (92.91 km/h or 57.73 mph).

She did once manage 56.3 knots (104.3 km/h or 64.8 mph) - but capsized shortly afterwards.

The boat's creators and team have spent years perfecting the awesome design.

The initial model was made in 1985, and 20 years later in 2005, it broke its first record.

In 2005 it crossed the Channel faster than Louis Blériot did by plane in 1909.

The
Hydroptere then beat two world speed records ratified by the World 
Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC) on 4th April 2007: 44.81 knots of 
average speed over 500 meters and 41.69 knots of average speed over one 
nautical mile.

June will
see the yacht's greatest challenge yet when she tries to set a new 
record for sailing from Los Angeles to Honolulu in Hawaii.

The hull and the floats of Hydroptere fly five meters above the sea surface, with just 2 m² of the boat surface left in contact with water

With its mast and sails reaching a height of 28m, an owner would need a garage the height of the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil to keep the yacht inside

@highlight

Hydroptere can reach speeds of 60mph using its giant 'wings' to lift most of its frame above the water

@highlight

Mast is 28m high - almost as tall as the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

@highlight

It can reach 50mph in ten seconds and has broken world records with its aeronautic design
