Louis van Gaal wants Manchester United executive chairman Ed Woodward to sign German stars Mats Hummels, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Muller while he oversees Holland’s World Cup campaign.

The incoming United manager is now focused on Holland — but is expecting United to act decisively over the next few weeks, with the club also closing in on Southampton left-back Luke Shaw.

All three moves are fraught with problems, with Borussia Dortmund unwilling to sell Hummels, while Muller, who also interests Barcelona, and Schweinstiger will be difficult to prise from Bayern Munich due to their long contracts. The total spend on the Germans is likely to top £100million.

On the move? Borussia Dortmund will be reluctant to let star defender Mats Hummels leave

Muller, 24, has felt marginalised by new manager Pep Guardiola and is seeking reassurances from Bayern that he remains a key player, while Schweinsteiger, 29, is open to the idea of joining United.

Both played under Van Gaal at Bayern in the team that won the double and reached the Champions League final in 2010.

Van Gaal converted Schweinsteiger from an attacking wide player into a holding midfielder, then he plucked Muller from Bayern’s youth squad and made him a mainstay of his team.

Both players have enormous respect for the Dutch coach and would be happy to move to United if they feel their careers are stalling under Guardiola.

Muller’s Bayern experience could be replicated at United by Tom Lawrence, James Wilson and Michael Keane with Van Gaal giving his assistant Ryan Giggs responsibility for creating a production line of youngsters into the first team.

Focused: Van Gaal in concentrating on achieving World Cup success with Holland in Brazil

Ever since his Ajax days, Van Gaal has promoted young players and gave Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Victor Valdes their Barcelona debuts.

With Giggs having such detailed knowledge of United and the club’s younger players, Van Gaal wants him to make sure the first-team squad is populated with a high proportion of  home-grown stars.

Giggs gave Lawrence and Wilson Premier League debuts as stand-in manager at the end of last season and put Keane on the bench against Hull.
