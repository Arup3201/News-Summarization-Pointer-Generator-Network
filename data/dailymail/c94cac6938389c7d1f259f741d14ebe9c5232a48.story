Even as they squabble over the last piece of grain, these hungry squirrels remain stomach-churningly cute.

The small group of European ground squirrels were fighting for the last bits as they nibbled at their lunch at the Radouc nature reserve in the Czech Republic.

The scene was captured by 33-year-old engineer Jiri Michal, one sunny afternoon at the reserve.

Hungry squirrels squabble over the last piece of grain, at the Radouc Nature reserve in the Czech Republic

Err, can I have some please? This ground squirrel apparently doesn't feel much like sharing his food

Mr Michal, of Pilsen, Czech Republic, says: 'I love taking photographs in the Czech Republic, I think the scenery and wildlife that the region has to offer is beautiful.

'I laid quietly on the ground while I took the photographs and spent around five hours capturing the scene.'

Waiting patiently just four meters away from the squirrels, Mr Michal offered them some grain and watched as they fought over the last pieces.

'After seeing the photographs, people often comment on how cute the squirrels are, it was amazing to watch,' he said.

Mr Michal leads regular photography workshops for beginners in his home town of Pilsen and hopes to encourage more people to take on wildlife photography.

European ground squirrels can be found in many areas of Eastern Europe, including southern Ukraine, Austria, Greece and Bulgaria.

This tiny species can grow up to 20cm in length, and can often be seen filling up on seeds and roots during the summer in preparation for winter hibernation.
