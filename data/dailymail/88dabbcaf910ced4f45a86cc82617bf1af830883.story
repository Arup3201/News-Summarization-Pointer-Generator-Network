Women who have had mastectomies to decrease their risk of developing breast cancer have dared to bare by posing naked for a charity calendar.

Many of the 25 women involved in the photo shoot are confirmed carriers of a faulty gene - BRCA - putting them at greater risk of hereditary breast cancer.

Carly Perkins, 28, from Crawley, is one of the women who agreed to strip off to raise funds for the National Hereditary Breast Cancer Helpline.

The mother-of-one told the MailOnline earlier this year how she had taken the decision to have a mastectomy after finding out she is a carrier of the deadly BRCA1 gene.

Her mother had developed breast cancer when she was a teenager (she since recovered after treatment) and her aunt died last year in her fifties after contracting ovarian cancer.

After seeing what her mother and aunt went through, Carly said she would hate for her own daughter, Tilly, 22 months, to see her battling cancer.

She said: 'I saw my mum suffer from cancer growing up, it's really hard to see someone you love like that.

'I don't want my daughter to see me suffering. As soon as I found out I carried the gene, it was a not a case of 'if' but 'when' I would have a mastectomy. Having it now means Tilly will be too young to remember any of it.'

With the support of her family, friends and partner, Damian, Carly had the operation in March and chose to have implants fitted at the same time.

She said it took her five weeks to recover and at first she felt self-conscious about her new body.

But when she found out the Breast Cancer Helpline were looking for models to pose in their calendar, she decided to volunteer. She was supported by the construction company ISG who sponsored her to take part so that all proceeds of the production of the calendar can go to charity.

Carly said it wasn't easy baring all in front of the cameras.

She said: 'I was so nervous. It was really nerve-racking but the team at Model Mentor were great at putting us at ease. Taking part has really boosted my confidence and it was great to meet the other women who have been through the same experience as me.

'Having a mastectomy can be a taboo subject and a lot of people still don't understand why women do it if they carry the BRCA gene. I hope this calendar proves having a mastectomy doesn't make you less of a woman or less beautiful.'

The 24 hour National Hereditary Breast Cancer Helpline was founded 20 years ago by Wendy Watson, who was one of the first women in the 
country to have preventative surgery after discovering nine out of 12 women
in her family had suffered from breast cancer.

A genetic link to cancer had not been proven at the time but was then discovered in the early 1990s thanks to the work of geneticist Mary-Claire King.

'There is so much more awareness 
about hereditary breast cancer nowadays,' said Wendy, referring to how celebrities such as Angelina Jolie, Sharon Osbourne and Michelle Heaton have helped bring the subject to attention after making public their decision to have preventative mastectomies.

She added: 'When I had my operation doctors
still needed convincing that breast cancer could be hereditary, let 
alone given the choice of different options of surgery.'

With the 2014 calendar, the charity hopes they can 'not only to dispel the myth 
that mastectomies are horrendous and make you less of a woman, but also 
to show others with a family history that not only are they not alone, 
they do have options.'

The models, whose ages range from 20s to 50s, came from all regions of the UK. They all have a connection with the BRCA gene and were prepared to bare all to inspire others.BRCA BABES calendar is available to buy for £10 from www.brcababes.com

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human genes that belong to a class known as tumor suppressors. Mutation of these genes has been linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer

A woman's risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer is greatly increased if she inherits a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Men with these mutations also have an increased risk of breast cancer

Gene faults are extremely rare with only about 1 in 20 cases of breast cancer associated with a faulty inherited gene

If women have concerns about their family history of breast cancer, they should go see their GP.  If their family history suggests they might be at increased risk of developing breast cancer, the GP may refer them on to a specialist family history or genetics service where their options for genetic testing and/or managing their risk can be discussed
