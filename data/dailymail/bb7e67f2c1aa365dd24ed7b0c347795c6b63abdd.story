The Bulgarian Football Union has thrown its support behind Aleksandar Tonev after the on-loan Celtic winger was banned last week for seven matches, having been found guilty of racially abusing Aberdeen’s Shay Logan.

The 24-year-old was found to have breached disciplinary rule 202 by an SFA judicial panel.

The charge covered ‘excessive misconduct by the use of offensive, insulting and abusive language of a racist nature’.

Tonev is set to appeal against the ruling and could yet face Logan when Celtic travel to Pittodrie on Sunday.

The Parkhead club have already expressed their support for the player, with his manager Ronny Deila saying he was ‘livid’ with the decision.

And, on Tuesday night, Tonev’s home association came out with its backing of the on-loan Aston Villa player.

Celtic assistant manager John Collins accompanied the Bulgarian midfielder to his hearing on Thursday

‘The Bulgarian Football Union would like to express its full support for the player,’ said the statement.

‘We join Celtic and express our willingness to use every possible set of international football laws to reveal the truth.

‘And, in this case, it is undeniable.

‘A young and talented Bulgarian footballer is charged and punished for an offence he allegedly did not commit and no evidence of his guilt.

‘Aleksandar Tonev (has) always been a role model, put his heart and soul on the field and never violated the principles of fair play in the football game. 

Collins and Tonev leave Hampden after hearing the result, but the club have insisted they will appeal

‘The Bulgarian Football Union strongly condemns all forms of racism and xenophobia in football stadiums and will continue its policy of zero tolerance for such events.

‘In the case of Tonev, however, we demand to see evidence that he had committed that of which he is accused.

‘Otherwise, we will consider that the penalty is biased and exaggerated.’

Tonev has made eight appearances for the Parkhead club since joining on a season-long loan deal from Villa during the summer transfer window.
