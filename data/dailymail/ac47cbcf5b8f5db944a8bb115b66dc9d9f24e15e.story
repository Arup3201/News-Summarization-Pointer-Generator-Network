Up until last week the Boston Bombers were just a basketball team out of New England.

The city's only semi-professional women's basketball team has changed their name after abruptly closing their Facebook page and website in a bid to disassociate themselves from last week's horrific attack.

They revealed their new name of the Boston Bulldogs on Tuesday.

'We was planning on changing it once the Boston
incident happened,' a team spokesperson confirmed to MailOnline.

The Bombers were one of more than 40 teams part of the Women's Blue Chip League, a non-salaried league that provided its players with advanced exposure for opportunities to compete in the next level.

The team featured a red and black logo of a detonating bomb with four basketball seams crossing the front.

Their website BostonBombersBasketball.com has since been abandoned and their Twitter page shows Tweets only up until last December.

The city is still recovering after the two bombings that went off at the finish line of the Boston marathon which left three dead and injured more than 180 people.

Suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed in a police shoot out while his brother, 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a second suspect in the attack, is currently recovering in hospital.
