Steven Gerrard became the third player in Liverpool history to make 700 appearances for the club on Wednesday night against Bolton in their FA Cup fourth round replay.

The Liverpool captain was recalled to the starting line-up by Brendan Rodgers, and he joined Ian Callaghan and Jamie Carragher in the club's 700 club.

Gerrard, who has spent all his career at Liverpool, marked the achievement by wearing a special pair of boots with the No 700 on them, and also the names of his daughters Lilly and Lexie.

The 34-year-old posted a message on Instagram last week looking forward to his 700th appearance, but was left out of the squad that beat West Ham 2-0 at Anfield at the weekend.

Gerrard will likely remain third behind Callaghan (857) and Carragher (737) as he is set to leave in the summer to join LA Galaxy.

Carragher tweeted: 'Myself & Ian Callaghan would like to welcome Steven Gerrard into the 700 club!'

Speaking on BBC before the fourth round replay at Bolton, Gerrard's former team-mate Danny Murphy praised Gerrard's longevity and success.

He said: ‘It’s incredible, really. Success and longevity at one club isn’t common these days.

'Himself, Frank Lampard, Scholes maybe, you can only name a few. He’s been everything good about Liverpool in the last 10 years, and pivotal when they’ve won trophies.

'He’ll sense an opportunity now Chelsea and Manchester City are out of this cup. Is it fate that the final lands on his birthday? We’ll have to wait and see, but what a player.’

Liverpool advanced to a fifth-round clash against Crystal Palace on February 14 as they came from behind to beat Bolton with two late goals from Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho.
