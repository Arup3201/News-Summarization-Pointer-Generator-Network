AC/DC's Angus Young has revealed drummer Phil Rudd had been 'in a strange place' even before he was charged with allegedly hiring a hitman in New Zealand earlier this month.

Young opened up about his troubled bandmate in an exclusive interview with Sydney's Triple M Grill Team.

The guitarist says the band had been facing some issues with Rudd's 'strange behaviour' over the last few years.

AC/DC bandmates Angus Young and Brian Johnson have joked about Phil Rudd's recent run-in with the law with US radio host Howard Stern. In a more recent interview, Young also revealed drummer Phil Rudd has been 'in a strange place'

'He's in a strange place, in a strange situation…It's something we have to get resolved, if we're going forward, something has to get resolved,' Young said in the interview which will air on Tuesday.

'We had a few problems ourselves before he got into this situation. There was a lot of strange behaviour going on. I guess you could put it down to him just not showing up for a lot of what we were doing and when you have to get to a stage where you have to convince someone to be there, you know it wears thin after a while - but it's something we have to resolve.

'It is a bit of a question mark…we go back a long way, he is a great drummer, but I think over these last few years, I don't know what he's got into or anything - I guess it doesn't help the situation that he's in.'

Prior to the exclusive interview, Young and AC/DC singer Brian Johnson joked about Rudd's recent run-in with law in New Zealand with US radio host Howard Stern. 

'My wife woke me up and said "Phil's been up to no good",' Young told Howard Stern.

'Someone said "who was he trying to hit". It was his drug dealer.'

Police charged Rudd with allegedly hiring a hitman to kill two men in New Zealand in September. Those charges were later dropped.

Rudd, who has been with the band on and off for nearly three decades, was charged with threatening to kill and drug possessing in New Zealand earlier this month

Johnson said he was getting ready to fly home to the States and had a cup of coffee in his hand when he saw the news on TV.

'There was this guy getting led out of a car with no shoes on looking like he was f***ing drugged and his head was on backwards,' Johnson said.

Young and Johnson were being interviewed about their latest album Rock And Bust when they spoke of Rudd. 

Police charged Rudd with allegedly hiring a hitman to kill two men in New Zealand in September. Those charges were later dropped.   

The 60-year-old drummer still faces charges of threatening to kill and possessing methamphetamine and marijuana. He is expected to appear in court on November 27. 

Stern asked if Rudd was a still a member of AC/DC as a result of the charges.

'We've got to resolve that,' Young said.

Johnson suggested Rudd would not be back in the band.

'I don't think we need to do any firing,' he said.

'The situation will take care of itself. He has gotten himself into a pickle. There is nothing we can do about it. We are talking about criminal charges here. We are talking about judges, we are talking about juries. We are going to go on tour. Nothing is going to stop us.'

But the pair made it clear that AC/DC would not break up because of Rudd.

'In the past we have had good drummers who have worked with us,' Young said.
