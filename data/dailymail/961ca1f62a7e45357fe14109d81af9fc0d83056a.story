The January transfer window closes at 11pm on Friday.

As the deadline approaches, Sportsmail gives you a rundown on the business likely to be done in the Premier League this week…

Still short of the £36million valuation in talks with Schalke over Julian Draxler. Eintracht Frankfurt right back Sebastian Jung, Lazio midfielder Hernanes and Nottingham Forest defender Jamaal Lascelles are being tracked.

Talented individual: Could Schalke's Julian Draxler be the signing to inspire Arsenal to the Premier League?

Another midfielder? Lazio's Hernanes (left) would increase the competition for places at Arsenal

Want another attacker and midfielder. Wigan’s James McArthur and Dale Stephens of Charlton are admired with Norwich’s Wes Hoolahan a difficult deal to pull off. Wolves’ Leigh Griffiths is another possible.

Surprise signing? Charlton midfielder Dale Stephens is among the most talented players in the Championship

Wilfried Zaha has signed on loan from Manchester United and a permanent deal for Fabio has been agreed. Talks are ongoing with Wigan for Ivan Ramis while Stoke’s Kenwyne Jones has arrived in a swap for Peter Odemwingie.

Still a target? Wigan's Spanish central defender Ivan Ramis (left) could yet end up at Cardiff City

Mohamed Salah has completed his move from Basle. Defensive options include Southampton’s Luke Shaw and Saint-Etienne centre back Kurt Zouma. Both are the subject of offers which may not be sealed until summer.

Strength is needed throughout the spine of the side but a lack of funds is preventing deals for Scott Dann, Momo Sissoko and Brighton’s Will Buckley. Stephen Dobbie could go to Huddersfield, while Blackburn want Paddy McCarthy.

Interesting move: Brighton's Will Buckley (centre) appears capable of stepping up to the Premier League

Bryan Oviedo’s injury will prompt action. Celtic’s Emilio Izaguirre, Dundee United’s Andy Robertson and Valencia’s Sergio Canales have all been discussed. Roma and Galatasaray want Johnny Heitinga.

Talented: Valencia's Sergio Canales was once seen as the next big thing in Spanish football

Bids are in for Phil Bardsley of Sunderland and Swansea's Neil Taylor. Deals have stalled for Porto's Steven Defour and Leicester’s Liam Moore and Jeffrey Schlupp. They may land Brondby's Simon Makienok or West Ham’s Ravel Morrison.

On the move? Ravel Morrison could leave one relegation-threatened London team for another

A bid of £600,000 will go in for Wigan’s Jean Beausejour and one will follow for Spurs’ Jake Livermore to make his loan permanent. Jack Hobbs could yet go to Leicester or Wigan, while Danny Graham is talking to Nottingham Forest.

Bargain? Wigan winger Jean Beausejour (right) could be available for as little as £600,000

Scouts went to watch Saul Niguez on Sunday night after talks with his father. The 19-year-old midfielder is on loan from Atletico Madrid at Rayo Vallecano. They have been offered Benfica midfielder Andre Gomes, 20, too.

Competitor: Rayo Vallecano's Saul Niguez (left) would add to Liverpool's numbers in midfield

City’s main objective is to bring in a centre back but Eliaquim Mangala at Porto is over-priced and Pepe at Real Madrid is not being released. West Ham would still be keen to sign Joleon Lescott before Friday.

Jumping for glory: Porto defender Eliaquim Mangala (left) remains a target for Manchester City

David Moyes has interest in Southampton’s Luke Shaw and Saint-Etienne defender Kurt Zouma but Chelsea remain favourites for both players. Moyes will continue to pursue defensive targets before Friday.

Highly rated: But Manchester United are not the only club interested in Southampton's Luke Shaw (left)

Talks over a deal for striker Luuk de Jong from Borussia Monchengladbach continue and Lyon midfielder Clement Grenier is a possibility. PSG’s £14m bid for Yohan Cabaye has been rejected.

Classy midfielder: Paris Saint-Germain's interest in Yohan Cabaye will test Newcastle

Scott Dann is set to arrive from Blackburn Rovers. An improved £3.5m bid for the 26-year-old should resolve the deal. Exeter’s Matt Grimes, 18, is a target too. Sheffield Wednesday want Luciano Becchio on loan.

Premier League experience: Blackburn's Scott Dann (right) would strengthen Norwich City's defence

Mark Hughes has brought in Peter Odemwingie but remains keen on another striker such as Monaco’s Emmanuel Riviere and a midfielder while Burnley right back Kieran Trippier is an option.

One down: Peter Odemwingie will be expected to add goals to Stoke's forward line

Dani Osvaldo is expected to leave this week. Inter Milan are interested and the player is keen. Midfielder Fredy Guarin could be used in a swap. Luke Shaw will stay until the summer barring a £25m-plus bid.

Incoming? Southampton could sign Inter's Fredy Guarin (right) in exchange for Dani Osvaldo

Waving goodbye? Southampton striker Dani Osvaldo no longer appears to have a future at the club

Gus Poyet is chasing Valencia’s Ever Banega and will make another bid for Liam Bridcutt at Brighton. Internacional forward Ignacio Scocco is in talks. Defender Modibo Diakite is heading to Fiorentina.

Classy midfielder: Valencia's Argentinian Ever Banega (left) is a talented individual

David Ngog is expected to finalise a £450,000 move from Bolton on Monday. Middlesbrough’s utility player Rhys Williams remains a target while a £3m bid has gone in for Anthony Pilkington at Norwich.

Goalscoring midfielder: Could Norwich's Anthony Pilkington give Swansea's season the boost it needs?

Heurelho Gomes is keen to go to PSV Eindhoven and they are among the clubs to have enquired about Lewis Holtby, as are Schalke. Everton have an interest in Nacer Chadli but Spurs may not allow a loan to rivals.

Departing? Goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes has been out of Tottenham's first team since 2011

Pepe Mel is interested in former Liverpool winger Albert Riera who is available from Galatasaray, Burnley’s Danny Ings has been watched while Nicolas Anelka is expected to leave but has rejected a bid from Lazio.

Controversial figure: But West Bromwich Albion's Nicolas Anelka could be on his way out of the club

An improved offer for Leeds’ Ross McCormack is expected on Monday following the loan signings of Antonio Nocerino and Marco Borriello. Raul Meireles is an option. Manchester City’s Joleon Lescott is wanted on loan.

Eye on the ball: Manchester City's Joleon Lescott (right) could be just what West Ham need
