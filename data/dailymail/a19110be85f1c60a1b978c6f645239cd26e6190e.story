Pauline Kinghorn, 62, received a lifetime ban for her poor treatment of the animals

A woman has been banned from keeping animals for life after her dogs' coats were left in such an appalling condition, they could hardly walk or see.

Pauline Kinghorn's three shih-tzus were barely recognisable as dogs, as their fur was so long and matted with food and faeces.

They were forced to drag themselves along the floor using their front legs due to the mass of hair.

An RSPCA officer finally rescued the dogs from Kinghorn's filth-laden home in Linton Colliery, Northumberland.

An experienced vet and expert dog groomer said their overgrown and unkempt coats were in the worst condition of neglect she had ever seen.

Bedlington Magistrates Court heard how the three shih-tzus had been neglected for five or six months, and that an elderly German Shepherd dog also found at Kinghorn's home had to be put down as it was in such poor health.

RSPCA Inspector Trevor Walker said: 'I have worked for the RSPCA for more than 15 years and during that time I have witnessed some pretty horrific things.

'However, I can honestly say that I've never seen such a deeply depressing sight as these three shih-tzu dogs.

'I can only describe them as dog-like, because there were no discernible points of the mouth, nose, or eyes through the mass or fur and dreadlocks.'

Kinghorn, 63, was yesterday handed a lifetime disqualification from keeping animals.

Kinghorn was also given an eight-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, and a two-month curfew order, which involves her having to stay at home between 7pm and 7am and be electronically tagged.

She was previously banned from owning cats for five years in 2003.

She admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the three shih-tzus and the German Shepherd between October last year and April this year.

She also admitted four charges of failing to ensure the welfare of the four dogs and 12 cats in her care.

The court was told the animals were found living in the ‘most appalling and unimaginable' conditions.

Paul Watson, defending, said Kinghorn had health problems, including visual impairment caused by dense cataracts and had no-one to help her look after the animals.

He said: 'This is not a case of deliberate cruelty, but one of neglect.

'She didn't know where to turn for assistance.'

Kinghorn was also ordered to pay £250 towards the RSPCA costs and the magistrates ordered the transfer of all of her animals to the charity.
