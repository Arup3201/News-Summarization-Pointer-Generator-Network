A quarter of British households throw away food amounting to £437 a year just because it ends up at the back of the fridge and they forget that it's there.

The Scots are the worst offenders, with more than one in ten (13 per cent) finding produce that has gone past its sell-by date.

Those in East Anglia (12 per cent), the North East (11 per cent) and Wales (10 per cent) were equally as bad when it came to wasting food.

Almost 10 per cent of the weekly shop ends up getting thrown away - be it leftovers, half eaten lunch packs or food that has gone past its expiration date. 

The  study by Samsung UK also highlighted that over a quarter (26 per cent) of Brits confess to 'top-up shopping' (buying food every other day), with more than one in five (23 per cent) only deciding what they're going to eat for dinner on the day.

More than one in five (22 per cent) think that a better food organisation system would help to reduce their food wastage.

And nearly a quarter (23 per cent) say that being able to more easily see what they buy once in their fridge freezer would help.

De-cluttered: Introducing more organisation into fridge-freezers may be the answer to reducing food waster

More than one fifth (22 per cent) confess to throwing away food that is more than a week past its sell by date, whilst four per cent have found an item in their fridge that was a year past its expiration date.

People are even more in the dark about the food left in their freezers, with 12 per cent confessing to throwing away an item that was a year past its perishable date.

Professional organiser and de-clutter Vicky Silverthorn, who counts Lily Allen, La Roux and Ed Sheeran among her clients, said that introducing more organisation into fridge-freezers may be the answer to reducing food wastage.

Ms Silverthorn said: 'Whether you're throwing away lunch leftovers or a bottle of milk that has gone out of date, no one likes to waste food. 

'A well-designed fridge can instantly help you to stay organised and keep on top of your weekly shop.'

The more visible the food, the more likely you are to use it up: If you can't see it you don't use it.  The easier the contents of your fridge are to see, the less likely you are to throw away out-of-date products. 

Make notes: Take a mental note of what you end up throwing out each week and make sure you have these products in a more visible place so you don't make the same mistake twice.

Keep the items you use most at the front of the fridge: Having the items you use most to hand as soon as you open the fridge door can make a world of difference.

Store at eye level the food you want to eat most of: If you're trying to eat more healthily, then make sure your fresh fruit and vegetables are the first thing you see when you open the fridge..

Make the most of flexible storage: Remember you can often move your refrigerator shelves up and down. So adjust to suit what you are storing to ensure you don't have any dead space. 

More than a third (34 per cent) of Brits have a partial storage system in their fridge freezer, storing bulk items like milk and eggs separately but 16 per cent confess to having no system at all, storing food wherever they find space.

Lana Sanleandro, Head of Marketing, Home Appliances, Samsung UK said; 'Every household in the UK will remember a time when they have found something in the back of their fridge that has gone past its sell-by date. 

'In spite of this, there are lots of ways to help reduce our household waste, whether that be through planning meals in advance, stricter trips to the supermarket or rearranging the way we store our food.'
