Jose Mourinho is far from choosing his first choice goalkeeper at Chelsea – despite a stunning save from Thibaut Courtois on his debut.

The returning Belgian ‘keeper and established No 1 Petr Cech are competing to be Mourinho’s first choice at Stamford Bridge this season and each played 45 minutes in Chelsea’s 3-0 pre-season defeat at Werder Bremen.

But Mourinho spoke afterwards about the situation, praising the man he says is the best young goalkeeper in the world but also flagging up how quiet Courtois was on his first outing with his new team-mates.

‘Courtois has only had two days of training, he is not ready. He needs to play, we don’t have lots of time until the beginning of the season – there’s two more weeks so we need to give him more playing time.

‘Petr (Cech) is the same so the decision was 45-45 here and the next match in Turkey will be exactly the same thing.

‘He (Courtois) had a fabulous save from the (Franco) Di Santo header, after that in the other two goals he has no chance and he was quiet - but the save was fantastic.’

Big call: Mourinho has the hard challenge of choosing between the two goalkeepers
