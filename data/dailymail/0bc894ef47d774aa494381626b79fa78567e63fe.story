Two high school girls who ran away and were feared to be in the clutches of a sex trafficking gang have been found unharmed.

Samantha Eldredge and Keyanna Monson, both 16, were tracked down by the FBI last night in Tacoma, Washington, some 60 miles from home.

The girls, who were found together, left home unexpectedly on January 28. Messages from older men found on their cell phones led to fears they had been lured away.

Investigators would not give details of exactly how or where the girls were found - but said that they are safe, local TV station KIRO reported. 

After the girls vanished from Snohomish County, near Seattle, friends said they had packed their bags and said they were leaving town.

They had not said where they were going, and just a few days later all their belongings were found in the trunk of a car - except for a pair of backpacks.

The girls, who have not yet been returned to their families, are believed to be in the car of federal agents.

A member of Samantha's extended family told the station: 'It's kind of an emotional thing for the whole family I think.

'But we're just really glad that they're home safe and uninjured.'
