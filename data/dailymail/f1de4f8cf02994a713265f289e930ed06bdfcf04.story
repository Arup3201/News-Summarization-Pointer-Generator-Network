Trainer Willie Mullins says unbeaten Faugheen will arrive at the starting line for the williamhill.com Christmas Hurdle a much fitter horse than the one which extended his unbeaten record to seven races with an easy three and a half length win in the Coral Hurdle at Ascot last month.

Ireland’s champion trainer also believes that Ruby Walsh’s mount will also have no problem with the two-mile Kempton test, one of the sharpest examinations of speed a hurdler can face.

Faugheen, whose opponents include Fighting Fifth Hurdle winner Irving, won the two-mile Grade One novices’ hurdle at Punchestown in April but every other time he has raced over hurdles it has been over further.

Over Christmas last year at Limerick, he won at three miles. He landed the two mile five furlong Neptune Investment Novices’ Hurdle at last season’s Cheltenham Festival and the Coral Hurdle is over two miles three furlongs.

Mullins said: ‘It is another big step up for him. We are going into Irving’s home ground — a flat right-handed track will suit him but he is in good order.

‘A lot of the time we raced over a longer trip because we were keeping him apart from the other horses (like Supreme Novices’ Hurdle winner Vautour). I knew he would stay but I knew he could come back in trip all right.

‘This year he has come back a hundred weight heavier. I was really worried with the size of him when he went over to Ascot. Dan Skelton, who stood in for me, passed a remark to Ruby that he had never saddled a horse to win a race like that which was as fat as he was.

‘If he can do that with that sort condition on him, there must be huge improvement for him for the rest of the season.’

Faugheen is 4-9 to win the Christmas Hurdle and 2-1 to win the Champion Hurdle despite the impressive performances of The New One in Britain.

Mullins admitted that Faugheen’s swift elevation to being regarded as one of the most exciting horse in jump racing has wrong-footed him.

He added: ‘He has surprised me that he is as good as he is. He was very ordinary point-to-pointer. To look at him last season he was so raw and scrawny, you wondered if he’d have the strength to run two mile five furlongs at Cheltenham.

‘He was skin and bone whereas Vautour was the apple of everyone’s eye. He is an oil painting of a horse.’
