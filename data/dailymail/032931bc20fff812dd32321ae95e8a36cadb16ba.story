Having failed to score a single Premier League goal since his £16million move to Liverpool this summer, Mario Balotelli is desperately trying to prove he is not a rip-off.

But the injured Italian striker, who hasn't played since picking up an injury on international duty in early November, is happy to wear ripped clothing while he awaits a first-team return.

Balotelli was at a Manchester Fashion Industry event on Sunday night, wearing a bizarre black leather jacket.

The Liverpool striker climbed into an expensive car after the party, the night after his team had beaten Stoke 

Balotelli, who hasn't played since early November because of injury, attracted plenty of attention at the party 

He has been taking advantage of his injury lay-off to enjoy his celebrity lifestyle - last week he was at the boxing match between Tony Bellew and Nathan Cleverly, before stepping out at the exclusive fashion show this weekend.

The Liverpool star was among several sporting stars at the Milton Club for the AW14 Monochrome party, which was advertised with the dress-code 'stylish monochrome attire'.

Former boxer Ricky Hatton was also spotted, though he was dressed rather more conservatively in a suit.
