Genetics will determine whether a person infected with Ebola dies, scientists  claimed today.

A new study has found DNA could be the key to tracking the deadly effects of the virus which has ravaged West Africa.

The World Health Organisation revealed nearly 5,000 people have died from the disease, which has devastated Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. 

A team of scientists at Washington University believe their study has identified genetic factors behind the mild-to-deadly range of reactions to the virus.

Some people exposed to the virus completely resist the disease.

Others suffer moderate to severe illness and recover, while those most susceptible succumb to bleeding, organ failure and shock.

Past studies of people who have contracted Ebola found these differences are not related to any specific changes in the virus itself, making it more or less dangerous.

Instead the body's attempts to fight infection seems to determine the severity of the disease. 

Researchers believe their new findings could accelerate vital drug and vaccine development, reflecting the diversity of reactions to the virus.

The study examined how the disease affects mice.

Study leaders Angela Rasmussen and Michael Katze said research on Ebola has to date been hampered by the lack of a mouse model that replicates the main characteristics of human Ebola.

Their study was conducted in a highly secure, state-of-the-art biocontainment lab in Montana. 

The scientists examined mice that they infected with a mouse form of the same species of the Ebola virus responsible for the current West African outbreak.

Conventional lab mice previously infected with the strain of virus died, but did not develop symptoms of the disease.

In the new study, researchers noted all the mice lost weight in the first few days after infection.

However, nearly one in five (19 per cent) not only survived, but also fully regained their lost weight within two weeks.

They showed no signs of having any gross pathological evidence of disease and their livers appeared normal.

One in nine of the mice (11 per cent) were found to be partially resistant and less than half of them died.

A third had blood that took too long to clot - a hallmark of fatal Ebola in humans.

Those mice also suffered internal bleeding, swollen spleens and changes in liver colour and texture. 

Dr Rasmussen said: 'The frequency of different manifestations of the disease across the lines of these mice screened so far are similar in variety and proportion to the spectrum of clinical disease observed in the 2014 West African outbreak.' 

While acknowledging that recent Ebola survivors may have had immunity to this or a related virus that saved them during this epidemic, Dr Katze said: 'Our data suggest that genetic factors play a significant role in disease outcome.'

Dr Katze said that, in general, when virus infection frenzied the genes involved in promoting blood vessel inflammation and cell death, serious or fatal disease followed. 

However, survivors experienced more activity in genes that order blood vessel repair and the production of infection-fighting white blood cells.

He added: 'We hope that medical researchers will be able to rapidly apply these findings to candidate therapeutics and vaccines.'

The researchers believe their mouse model can be rapidly implemented to find genetic markers, leading to studies to examine how symptoms originate and take hold.

They hope to evaluate drugs and broad spectrum anti-viral activites against all strains of the Ebola virus, including that responsible for the current West African epidemic.

The study was published in the journal Science.

Professor of Virology at Warwick University, Andrew Easton said the paper demonstrates that genes do play a role in determining the outcome of Ebola. 

'This is not surprising as similar observations have been made for many viruses,' he said.

'The paper shows that the precise cells infected and extent of Ebola virus replication is, in part, determined by the host genes.

'Most of these genes are involved in the very earliest stages of our immune response to infection, again an observation seen with other viruses.

'While this is valuable information the date in the paper cannot be directly extrapolated to the human situation and used as a basis for potential therapy at the moment, as, unlike the mice used in the study, humans are extensively outbred and have a large variety of genetic combinations, making assessment of the impact of the genes in humans difficult.

'The paper does not assess the role of environmental factors that undoubtedly also play a role in the disease process such as the underlying health status of the at-risk population.

Professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, Jonathan Ball, added: 'We know that host genetics influences infection outcome for a range of viruses, like HIV and norovirus. We've also suspected that genetics plays a role in susceptibility to Ebola virus infection.

'In the current mouse model study, the finding that levels of expression of a gene involved in coagulation differs between mice showing different severity of disease symptoms is really intriguing.

'Of course, this is merely an association and needs to be explored more to know definitively how expression is controlled and how it might influence disease. It will also be important to see if a similar phenomenon is happening in humans

'It's a reminder of how infectious diseases shape the evolution of a host; and the human host is no different to any other.'
