A veteran nurse was stabbed to death on Tuesday as she bravely tried to protect her patients from a knife-wielding man.

Gail Sandidge, had been on the hospital staff
since 1978, hospital CEO Steve Altmiller said at a news
conference.

'She was protecting her patients by an act of courage, and she lost
her life as a result,' he said.

Four other people were injured on Tuesday in a stabbing attack at the Ambulatory Surgical Center of Good
Shepherd Medical Center in Longview, Texas.

Kyron Rayshawn of Longview, Texas has been charged with murder after a nurse was stabbed to death at the Good Shepherd Medical Center on Tuesday

A 22-year-old man has been charged with murder in the stabbings
which happened around 7am.

Gregg County Jail booking records show Kyron Rayshawn Templeton
of Longview is also accused of four counts of aggravated assault.

Officer Kristie Brian, a Longview police spokeswoman, said it’s
not yet clear what led to the attack.

Of the four others wounded, one was in critical condition, one
was in good condition and two were treated at the hospital and discharged,
Altmiller said.

Templeton was at the hospital with his mother when he went on a
knife-slashing rampage, Longview police said.

Templeton fled on foot but was
caught nearby, subdued after a brief struggle and arrested, Brian said.

Neither Templeton nor the arresting officers were injured, Brian
said. A knife believed to have been the weapon used in the attack has been
recovered, she said. 

His bond has
been set at $2.6 million. Jail records did not list an attorney for Templeton.

Surveillance video was being reviewed by the hospital’s security
team and would be turned over to police, said Kenny Jernigan, Good Shepherd’s
security director.

Good Shepherd Medical Center is a 425-bed acute-care hospital
about 120 miles southeast of Dallas.

All surgeries scheduled for Tuesday and
Wednesday were postponed and were being rescheduled, Altmiller said.
