It seems the apple doesn't fall far from the tree when it comes to LeBron James Junior's incredible basketball skills.

The son of basketball superstar LeBron James is just eights years old but it appears he's already mastered some of father's renowned skill on the court.

And the proud NBA Miami Heat player was more than happy to show what his son is capable of after posting a video on Twitter showing LeBron Junior sinking a trick shot - from a second-floor mansion balcony.

Difficult: The eight-year-old missed on his first three attempts

The footage filmed by the basketball player shows his son up on the balcony of their $9million Coconut Grove home in Miami, Florida, with two basketballs.

The schoolboy then launches the first one all the way across the court but narrowly misses the net.

He then gives it a second and third attempt but misses both.

His father then encourages him to give it another go, calling 'come on buddy, you were close that time', before LeBron James Junior gives it a fourth shot and incredibly sinks the ball in the hoop effortlessly.

LeBron Junior is seen jumping up and down with delight while his proud father can be heard cheering in the background.

Alongside the short video clip, his father James, 27, tweeted: 'Iâ€™ve seen a lot of highlights the last couple of days but none better than this one #bronny #trickshot.'

LeBron Raymone James - nicknamed King James - is an eight-time NBA All-Star and has earned eight All-NBA honors and four All-Defensive honors.
