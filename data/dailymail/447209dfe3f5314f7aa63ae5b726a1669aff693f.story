At first glance, this picturesque Welsh manor house appears to have little in common with the grand mansion featured in Downton Abbey.

But according to historian Rev Geraint Hughes, Penybont Hall in Powys is the building that inspired writer Julian Fellowes to create his hit television show.

For Mr Hughes has revealed that the house once employed Oscar winner's family as servants.

At that time it was far larger boosting a further 60 rooms. It was only downsized to its present size after the owner demolished an entire wing to save money.

As it stands today: The manor house is half of its original size after an entire wing was demolished to save money and make it a more manageable size

As grand as Downton: Penybont Hall as it stood in 1885 after it had been extended adding a further 60 rooms

Highclere Castle which is used as the backdrop for the TV series. Historian Rev Geraint Hughes said: 'It is easy to see the similarities between what it was like at the Hall and what is shown on Downton Abbey.'

But back in the 1800s when Lord 
Fellowes' relatives worked on the mid-Wales estate Penybont Hall was the
hub of the wealthy and well-heeled.

Rev Hughes has revealed that in 1875 Lord Fellowes great-grandfather, Pat Mackintosh, worked for landowner John Percy Severn.

Downton's Earl of Grantham is 
believed to be based on Mr Severn who was a wealthy director of two 
railway companies as well as the owner of Penybont Hall.

It was during this period that the 
buildling was given a massive makeover and the building was extended 
with a further 60 rooms being added.

Rev Hughes said: 'The son of John Severn, Percy had very grand ideas and he wanted to extend the buildings.

'He had great plans for expanding it and they built on it far more than they ever needed.

'Percy made considerable changes to the house soon after his father's death in 1885.'

Setting the scene: In the hit TV series, Downton Abbey provides a grand backdrop for the drama centered around the Grantham family

Sophie McShera who plays housemaid Daisy Robinson in the series. Historian Jennifer Newby said the servants in the country house drama look too clean and act far too familiar with their employers.

But some 30 years later after the 
house had been sold to a former Army general the extensions were 
reversed to become a 32-room building.

Rev Hughes isn't sure when this took place but placed it between 1907 and 1926.

'The servants in the programme are 
far too clean. The reality would have been a lot more grubby, I don't 
think people realise the servants stank'

He said: 'The general's wife was widowed and it was too much for her to take on.

'It is a lovely building and much of what you see in Downton Abbey reflected life at Penybont Hall.

'The Severns were wealthy landowners and were very much at the heart of the local community.

'It is easy to see the similarities between what it was like at the Hall and what is shown on Downton Abbey.'

However, despite the plaudits the 
series has received some experts are critical that the series is not as 
true to the past as it could be.

Historian Jennifer Newby said the image of life at Downton Abbey is completely wrong and 'infuriating to watch'.

She claims the servants in the country house drama look too clean and act far too familiar with their employers.

'I find it infuriating to watch, it sets my teeth on edge,' she said.

'The relationship they have with their employers is totally wrong.'

Viewers who watched the Christmas Day
special saw members of the aristocratic Crawley family support valet 
John Bates and his wife, housemaid Anna, during his trial and eventual 
conviction for his first wife's murder. The Crawleys also hosted a dance
for the servants.

The two-hour episode ended with Matthew Crawley finally going down on one knee and proposing to Lady Mary.

Ms Newby, the editor of Family 
History magazine and author of a new book called Women's Lives, has read
hundreds of letters and diaries kept by people who worked in service 
and the families they worked for.

'There was one butler who said that 
even if in a moment of weakness an employer could ask for advice they 
wouldn't give it because it could be held against them,' she said.

'The servants in the programme are 
far too clean. The reality would have been a lot more grubby, I don't 
think people realise the servants stank.

Gun enthusiast and former editor of 
the Shooting Times, Tony Jackson, also picked out inaccuracies with 
clothes during the Christmas special.

Mr Jackson, 74, said the show was 'full of errors', especially the scene involving the game shoot.

'The scene is supposed to depict a shooting party in 1919-20, but they are dressed as though they are in the 1890s,' he said.

'It is full of errors. Why on earth didn't they do their research properly and get it right.'

Mr Jackson, who has published several
books on shooting, added: 'The guns are wearing leather gaiters - an 
item of clothing that would not have been work during the Twenties.

'All would have worn stockings, plus 
fours and possibility light-coloured spats. The only people who would 
have worn gaiters would have been the hired help.'
