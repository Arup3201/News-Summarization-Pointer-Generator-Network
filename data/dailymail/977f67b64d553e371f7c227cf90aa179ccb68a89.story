Roy Hodgson has revealed that England striker Danny Welbeck will be fit to face Italy in England's World Cup opener on Saturday.

The Manchester United forward had limped out of training on Wednesday with a slight thigh injury.

Hodgson said: 'Danny Welbeck is fit. Even after four weeks, the only player not available is Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. No complaints on that score.'

The 66-year-old also thanked the people of Manaus for the fabulous welcome they have afforded England but his players had abandon a stroll in the park yesterday because they were mobbed by well wishers.

Hodgson said: 'Our trip to the supermarket... the shopping mall, I mean, we thought it might be nice for the players to get out and see the place, but the mobbing was so much we had to abort the trip.'

Captain Steven Gerrard added: 'There wasn't any shopping getting done. We went for a morning stroll, that's all, mixing with the locals. But the serious stuff starts now.â€
