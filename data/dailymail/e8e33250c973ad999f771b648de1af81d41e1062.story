The cause of death of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham has been confirmed by a medical examiner - but is being kept secret at the request of investigators, it today emerged.

Miss Graham, 18, went missing in downtown Charlottesville, Virginia, after leaving a bar at 2am on September 13. She was last seen with Jesse Matthew Jr, who has been charged with her abduction.

The sophomore's remains were discovered buried in a shallow grave in a densely wooded area of Albemarle County, eight miles from Charlottesville, in mid-October following a month-long search.

Now, more than a month on, the cause and manner of her death have been confirmed by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Virginia, it has been revealed.

However, the details will not yet be disclosed to the public after a police officer investigating the high-profile incident asked for the information to remain secret, according to CBS News.

The medical examiner’s office said the Charlottesville officer had requested the cause and manner of Miss Graham's death to be 'withheld' for the time being, but refused to say anything further.

Strangely, Charlottesville Police department is not leading the investigation into the case - Albemarle County Police is in charge. Neither police department, nor Albemarle Commonwealth's attorney, Denise Lunsford, would comment on the revelations, according to the Richmond Times Dispatch. 

Last weekend, hundreds of people gathered at West Potomac High School to pay tribute to Miss Graham, whose disappearance in September made headlines across the world.

Friends described her as 'smart and sassy', while teacher Nicole Borghard said members of staff would often scan their rosters, hoping for an opportunity to teach the 'witty' student.

The victim's classmates Rachel and Campbell and Hannah O'Neil spoke of how they previously made smores over a campfire with Miss Graham, who had a buoyant personality and a droll British wit.

In front of 1,000 attendees, they recalled how their friend insisted on 'bringing her own British chocolate [to the campfire] because Hershey's was not up to her standards.'  

Meanwhile, teacher Allison Satterwhite told of how Graham relished the opportunity to correct her teachers in a way that still managed to be endearing.

She recalled a hallway encounter in which the teacher was lecturing a group of students for causing a commotion in the hallway, prompting Graham to tell her that 'disruptional' was not a word.

'She had a great wit - it could be snarky at times but that's what we loved about her,' said her band teacher, Steve Rice, who shared stories about Graham's love of Elvis songs and the saxophone.

Miss Graham's parents, John and Sue Graham, thanked the community for their support, particularly those who turned out to help police in the 35-day search for their daughter. 

'Hannah was always able to steal the show,' Mr Graham said. 'We think she would have made important contributions to society in the years ahead.'  

It comes just days after 32-year-old Matthew, from Virginia, pleaded not guilty to attempted capital murder, rape and abduction in connection with an unrelated case.

The suspect made his first in-person court appearance in Fairfax County, Virginia, last Friday morning following the alleged attack on a 26-year-old woman in September 2005.

The victim had  been walking home from a grocery store when she was reportedly dragged into a wooden area and sexually assaulted. Her attacker ran away after being startled by a passerby.

Donning a green jail jumpsuit and with his dreadlocks tied back, Matthew bowed his head as he entered a not guilty plea in the nine-year-old case. The judge set a trial date for March 9, 2015.

Matthew was arrested and charged two months ago with abducting Miss Graham. Authorities claim DNA evidence links Matthew to the 2005 assault in Fairfax, as well as the 2009 disappearance and death of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington, according to NBC 4.

As news of Miss Graham's disappearance hit the headlines earlier this year, reports emerged that the suspect had been accused of sexual assault multiple times in the past 12 years. 

He first came to police attention when the first sexual assault allegation was made against him at Liberty University on October 17, 2002, when a woman accused him of raping her on campus.

The allegation was investigated by Lynchburg Police and turned over to the prosecutor's office - but the woman declined to press charges and no witnesses could be found, so the case was dropped.

His last day at the school was the day the accusation was made, the Washington Post reported.

Matthew then attended Christopher Newport University, where he was accused of another sexual assault on September 7, 2003. 

Five days after the alleged incident, Matthew quit the school's football team and a month after, he left the school. It is not yet clear how this second incident was resolved.

Last month, Matthew made his first court appearance in the 2005 case via videolink in Charlottesville. Earlier this week, he was transferred to Fairfax Jail ahead of his in-person appearance.

He will now be returned to Charlottesville for a preliminary hearing on December 5 in relation to the alleged abduction of Miss Graham with the intent to defile. He is not yet facing murder charges.   

Albemarle County Police and Charlottesville Police were not immediately available for comment when contacted by MailOnline.
