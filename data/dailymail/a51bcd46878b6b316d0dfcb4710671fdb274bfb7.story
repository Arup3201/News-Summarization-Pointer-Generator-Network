Caught on camera: Career criminal Calvin Reid has been jailed for two years after he stole a cancer patient's handbag and was identified after he was chased and this picture was taken

A career criminal with 227 convictions stole a cancer patient's handbag as she lay in her hospital bed but was caught after mattress delivery men gave chase and took a picture.

Calvin Reid, who has been banned from virtually every shop in Britain, was described as 'the lowest of the low' by a judge who jailed him for two years.

The victim, a 67-year-old woman, was receiving treatment at Essex County Hospital, Colchester, when she woke to find Reid leaning over her bed and then saw her handbag was missing.

Hospital staff suspected Reid, 46, was the culprit and chased him before confronting him outside.

Alan Price, a hospital contractor who had joined the chase with colleague Jamie Thompson, wrestled the bag off Reid and took a picture of him on his mobile phone.

Police used the image to identify Reid and arrested him.

Reid, 46, of Colchester, admitted theft when he appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court and was jailed for two years.

Judge Patricia Lynch QC told Reid: 'You are the lowest of the low.This was particularly mean and unpleasant.

'Your victim was lying there prone, asleep and you entered the room and took advantage of the situation.'

The court heard the victim was in a private room in Jefferson ward at the hospital in Lexden Road and was receiving cancer treatment.

She alerted staff after finding Reid in her room and her bag missing, on April 14 this year.

Alan Price, named in court as simply 'Alan the mattress man', was making a delivery to Essex County Hospital when the drama unfolded.

The 42-year-old father-of three said: 'We heard the cry for help from two of the nurses.

'The adrenaline kicked in and we chased this chap across the road towards the town centre and caught up with him in Crouch Street.

'It was a bit like Rodney and Del Boy coming after him.

'Jamie and I blockaded him and challenged him.

'He was against some railings and we wrestled the bag back.'

Hero: Alan 'mattress man' Price with picture he took after he trapped Reid. Mr Price admitted that he and his friend Jamie looked 'a bit like Del and Rodney' from a classic Only Fools and Horses episode as they gave chase

Reid broke free and ran up a nearby street, forcing a motorist to swerved to avoid him.

Medical help: Nurse Rachel Minter also chased the thief off the ward to get the handbag back

Mr Price took a picture of the crook before he ran back into Crouch Street.

He said: 'I am a keen amateur photographer and had my phone on me. I thought a photograph might be useful.

'I sent the picture to the nurse and she sent it to the police.

'I had no idea it would lead to his arrest within an hour.

'We were in the right place at the right time and just wanted to get the lady's bag back.' 

The pair work for Talley Medical, which delivers mattresses to hospitals. 

The handbag, which still contained £200 and personal items, was returned to the patient.

Speaking after the hearing, Rachel Minter, ward sister on the hospital's Jefferson ward, said: 'Staff nurse Danielle Woods was looking after this particular patient and she ran past my door with student nurse Gemma Eley.

'They chased after a man who had come onto the ward and had possibly taken a handbag.'

Mrs Minter joined the pursuit, along with deliverymen Mr Price and Mr Thompson.

Nurse Woods had called the police and officers arrester Reid nearby.

Reid claimed he and a friend were taking a short cut through Essex County Hospital and his friend had handed him the bag.

Gavin Burrell, mitigating, told the court Reid now realises how bad the incident had been.

He had written a letter to the court expressing remorse and sorrow for his actions.

Calvin Reid has previously been branded Colchester's most prolific shoplifter and 'a complete social menace'.

Chelmsford Crown Court heard his criminal record stretched to 227 offences and he had been given a suspended prison sentence for stealing a Help for Heroes charity tin last year.

Six years ago he was banned from every shop in the country.

However, an exception was made for his local Tesco so he could still buy food.

He was also allowed to go to his nearest pharmacy so he could get his methadone prescription.

He was a homeless drug addict at the time.

The ban came after he was caught trying to steal a carton of cigarettes from the Co-op supermarket on Abbot's Road, Colchester.

A year later he was banned from Colchester town centre indefinitely after clocking up 78 convictions for 188 offences.
