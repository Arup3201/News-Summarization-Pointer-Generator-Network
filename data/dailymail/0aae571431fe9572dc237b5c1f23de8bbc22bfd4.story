Judy Murray followed in her son's footsteps by crashing out of a tournament well before the final hurdle.

After weeks and weeks of trying to win everyone’s approval on Strictly Come Dancing, it was time for the 55-year-old tennis coach to say goodbye.

Strictly saw the remaining nine contestants take to the stage at the Tower Ballroom in Blackpool for the show's famous and dazzling Blackpool Week.

‘You are just wonderful,’ Anton added. ‘I want you to keep going with dancing wherever you are.’

Judges Len Goodman, Darcey Bussell, Bruno Tonioli and Craig Revel Horwood all chose to save Sunetra.

Head judge Len said: ‘I would like to say tonight’s performance was fantastic… and you are wonderful.’

An emotional Judy went on the praise the efforts of her dance partner.

‘We got lucky,’ she confessed. ‘Anton has been lovely, he’s made my Strictly experience very special’.

To which Anton went on to say: ‘She’s such a great person. The fun that we had is purely because of her humour. She’s been such a sport… I have had the best time ever.’
