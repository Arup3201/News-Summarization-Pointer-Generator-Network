A British doctor can thank her lucky stars for seeing her stunning photographs of the night sky turned into stamps.

Dr Samantha Crimmin was working as an 
emergency medic for the British Antarctic Survey team, when she took the 
celestial images over South Georgia.

Using long exposures and plenty of patience, Dr Crimmin was able to capture these incredible shots, which show star trails in a perfect circular motion.

A series of stunning photographs by Dr Samantha Crimmin, which show the night sky over South Georgia, have been turned into a series of stamps for the south Atlantic territory

Her gallery of photographs depict the night sky above different locations on the tiny outpost in the south Atlantic, which is 800 miles away from the nearest light pollution.

They include one above the Harker Glacier, named after British geologist Alfred Harker, and over the wrecks of two Norwegian whaling ships at Grytviken.

Dr Crimmon, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, also captured beautiful photographs of the Milky Way above the southern seas.

She was able to create the circular starry effect, by taking multiple snaps from the same point on a 30-second exposure over a two-hour period.

Because the shutter was open for 30 seconds, each star had a little trail behind it from where the Earth moved in that time-frame.

Using computer software, the 33-year-old then 'layered' the images on top of one another to create the images.

The keen photographer usually sells prints of her photographs for £15 to £45.

A spokesman for the Government of South Georgia said: 'South Georgia is an ideal location for astrophotography, as the nearest light pollution is over 800 miles away.

'On a clear night the quantity of stars is simply breathtaking.

'The images used for our Star Trail stamps were collected over six months and created by pointing the camera towards the south celestial pole and taking long exposure photos.'
