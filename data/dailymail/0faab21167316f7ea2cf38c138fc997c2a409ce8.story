Forget Seventies vibes and parka coats, because there's an even bigger trend taking off at Paris Fashion Week - and it's not on the catwalk. 

Fashion editors have noticed  manspreading has, quite literally, spread from New York to the French capital via Milan.

The term, which was originally coined to refer to men who spread their legs and hog an unfair amount of space on packed subway trains in New York, is apparently gaining momentum on the show's hottest front rows.

Times style reporter Matthew Schneier posted an exemplary photo on Instagram with the caption: 'Manspreading, dreaded NYC subway phenomenon, has arrived at the front rows in Paris.'

And it seems he's onto something. Elle magazine has also picked up on the trend, noting that Miles Teller went wide at Prada, Renzo Rosso kneed his seatmates at DSquared2 and Giuseppe Zanotti cleared the stands at DSquared2.

Even British racing car champion Lewis Hamilton was keen to open up at the Louis Vuitton show.

The term first came to light at the end of 2014, when men taking the New York subway were asked to sit more considerately as part of a new campaign to tackle 'manspreading on the city's public transport.

Indeed, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority this month unveiled public service advertisements aimed at men who spread their legs and hog an unfair amount of space on packed subway trains.

Perhaps all the men should take note from Charlie Hunnam and Jim Nelson

The poster reads: 'Dude...Stop the Spread, Please', alongside an image of two subway commuters forced to stand because a man is sitting in the typical 'manspread stance - legs splayed into a wide V-shape.

The campaign, which carries the slogan, 'Courtesy Counts: Manners Make a Better Ride', is also targeting other subway users, such as those whose bulky backpacks get in the way of other riders.

Manspreading has become a hotly debated topic for subway riders, who go so far as to post photographs of the worst culprits on Twitter or even confront them on video.

A reporter for The Gothamist set out to confront 'manspreaders' on the New York City subway and did not have trouble finding interviewees.

She asked each man if they think their own 'leg splay' is appropriate given the people around them. Many insist this is not normal behavior.

One commuter explains that his splay is to accommodate a bag, while another says that he is exhausted. And one defiant passenger insists all men biologically require ample space.
