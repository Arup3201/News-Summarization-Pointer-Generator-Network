An aeroplane which veered off a runway after landing in strong winds was re-painted white to conceal the airline's insignia to avoid bad publicity.

The ATR-72 turboprop plane, which belonged to Romanian carrier Carpatair but was leased by Italian carrier Alitalia, was re-painted to protect the brand's reputation, officials have said, causing anger among unions.

Displaying the Alitalia colours and logo, the plane crashed on Saturday injuring six, but by Sunday it had been painted white by Alitalia staff - before it was even moved from the crash site.

Italian colours: The plane veered off a runway after landing in strong winds while operating under Alitalia colours, injuring six people onboard

Paint job: The plane on Sunday after it had been re-painted, leaving no evidence of the Italian carrier's insignia

The plane, which was traveling from Pisa-Galileo Airport to Leonardo da Vinci airport in Rome, had the Italian airline’s name visible on its fuselage but after it was re-painted, all that remained was a small Romanian flag indicating the origin of the aircraft's owner, a budget airline based in Timisoara, Romania.

Alitalia argued that the paint job was standard corporate practice to protect brand reputation and operated all over the world .

Giancarlo Schisano, Alitalia's director of operations, was quoted in The Daily Telegraph saying: ‘Blocking out a carrier's livery is a normal way of protecting a company's reputation, and even more in this case, because it is not an Alitalia plane.’

Protecting the brand: The ATR-72 turboprop plane clearly showed the Alitalia logo and colours after the crash but the plane, which was leased by the Italian carrier by Romanian carrier Carpatair, was painted soon afterwards

Evidence disguised: The small Romanian flag (above the windows) indicated that the plane was actually a Romanian aircraft. After the plane was re-painted, the flag was all that remained of the insignia

An Alitalia spokesperson said: ‘This is something that is done by airline companies in many countries and we are surprised that such a fuss is being made. It is a matter of brand protection.’

Passengers onboard said the Italian carrier's insignia was misleading because they thought they were flying on an Alitalia plane.

One female passenger told Italian media: ‘I bought the ticket online from the Alitalia website and all the markings on the plane are Alitalia. What happened is shameful.’

Passengers felt misled: About 50 people were aboard the plane and some told Italian media that they were under the impression they were flying on an Italian plane

Of the six passengers injured, a girl with a spinal injury was transported to the Gemelli hospital by ambulance.

Winds were steady at about 32 mph with gusts up to 47 mph and there were scattered clouds at the time of the crash, according to local reports.

About 50 people were aboard the plane, which ended up in the grass, slightly inclined and with damaged landing gear.

The accident temporarily closed the airport.
