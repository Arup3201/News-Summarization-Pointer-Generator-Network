One Cardiff City employee is set to 
leave the club and another two are being investigated over the spying 
scandal  surrounding their game against Crystal Palace.

The
 Welsh club’s former head of recruitment, Iain Moody, now director of 
football at Palace, is accused of obtaining team information ahead of 
Palace’s 3-0 win in Wales last Saturday.

Cardiff have reported their suspicions to the Premier League and Sportsmail can reveal that the allegations also include an assertion that Moody contacted at least three individuals at the club between Wednesday and Friday of last week, asking for information about the team.

A prominent Cardiff source has told us that manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was made aware of what was going on when a message sent from Moody’s phone, listing the starting 11 against Palace, was received by a Cardiff employee. The employee tipped off Solskjaer, who reported the matter to the club hierarchy, but the Norwegian did not change his team.

Moody and Palace have strenuously denied they attempted to obtain team information from anyone at Cardiff.

Cardiff have not complained formally to the  Premier League, but chairman Mehmet Dalman has handed over a dossier and requested the incident be reviewed.

The dossier has been built around what the source calls ‘real evidence’, including the phone records of staff who would have had access to the information that was leaked, and text messages from Moody, who was sacked by owner Vincent Tan last year.

Solskjaer referred all matters relating to the incident to Dalman, but he did not wish to comment.Solskjaer
 raised eyebrows after the Palace defeat by indicating there was a lack 
of ‘loyalty’ among some elements of the dressing room, though he said it
 related to players following his instructions.

On Saturday he said: ‘I
 have no reason to doubt any of my players’ professionality (sic), 
honesty, integrity or loyalty. I have said what I have said and the rest
 will come from Mehmet. I have just answered the question and how many 
times have I got to tell you?’

Responding to the allegations on 
Thursday, Moody said: ‘I don’t think I have done anything wrong. That is
 incredibly, extraordinarily untrue. That is untrue, completely untrue.’

While he strongly denied  contacting anyone at Cardiff to try to 
elicit information, he did admit to using wider contacts in the game, as
 is standard practice.

‘That is the whole point of what we do as scouts,’ he added

Cardiff
 captain Steve Caulker said yesterday: ‘To be honest with you, there 
have been problems like that all season, where certain things have been 
leaked.

‘It is frustrating. We need to focus on getting things right 
on the pitch, not what’s going on off the pitch. I will be telling the 
boys that we need to get performances in and get results, not concern  
ourselves with off-the-field issues.

‘It has obviously come from 
somewhere. That’s down to the gaffer (Solskjaer) and the staff above him
 to sort out, and we can just focus on playing football.

‘A lot of 
stuff has been going on off the pitch all season, and that has been 
highlighted in the press. It is important we all ignore all that stuff. 
Our performances have not been up to scratch of late.’
