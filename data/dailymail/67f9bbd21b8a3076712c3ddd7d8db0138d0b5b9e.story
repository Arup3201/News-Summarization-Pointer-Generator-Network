The final desperate hours of rock star Michael Hutchence were revealed yesterday by the two detectives who investigated his death.

Before he hanged himself in his hotel room in Sydney in November  1997, Hutchence had been rummaging through a bin, desperate to  find drugs, they said.

In the same bin, they found the lyrics of the last song he wrote – which have never been published.

Battle: The detectives tell how the singer, pictured left with Paula Yates and their daughter Tiger Lily, was pushed to a state of self-destruction during a bitter custody battle with between Yates and Bob Geldof, right

Traumatic: Paula Yates, they claim, drank a bottle of vodka when she arrived at the Ritz-Carlton after he died

They also told of the despair of his 
girlfriend, Paula Yates, and her very public insistence that Hutchence 
had died accidentally during a sex game.

Former
 detective inspectors Mark Smith and Michael Gerondis spoke out publicly
 for the first time amid controversy in Australia over a two-part TV 
film about Hutchence’s band, INXS, shown over the weekend and criticised
 as inaccurate by his family.

The
 37-year-old singer killed himself at the height of a bitter custody row
 over Miss Yates’s children with her husband Bob Geldof.

The
 two Australian detectives told how they found evidence of a troubled 
man on the path to self-destruction. Hutchence’s fingers were dark with 
nicotine stains and he had an old cigarette burn so deep that it exposed
 the bone, they said.

‘The 
cigarette went right through his fingers and it was sort of infected,’ 
Mr Gerondis told Sydney’s Sunday Telegraph newspaper.

The
 officers said there were signs that Hutchence had been trying to  find 
drugs before he died. The singer had even rifled through a bin. ‘He was 
trying to get some cocaine but he did not get it so he was going through
 the bin,’ said Mr Gerondis.

It was at 11.50am the next day  that a hotel maid found the singer who had hanged himself.

‘The
 maid could not get in because he was behind the door,’ said Mr Gerondis.

Hell-bent on self-destruction: Michael Hutchence hunted for cocaine in the bin before penning his final lyrics then  took his life on November 22, 1997. He left nothing in his will for the family he fought with

Coroner
 Derrick Hand later ruled that Hutchence had committed suicide in a 
depressed state of mind while affected by drugs – a mind that was also 
tormented by the battle over custody of Miss Yates’s children. The legal
 fight meant that Hutchence’s own daughter with her, 16-month-old Tiger 
Lily, was not going to be able to visit him in Australia that Christmas.

Discovered: The maid found the singer's body at 11.50am. She pushed the door and he fell from behind it

Miss
 Yates never accepted the ruling that Hutchence had committed suicide, 
claiming in a TV interview that he had died during an auto-erotic sex 
game.

Such was her 
determination to make her point about this to police that when she 
arrived in Australia following his death she shouted at the detectives 
in a restaurant while giving graphic details of the sex games she and 
Hutchence played. ‘He would strangle me during sex,’ she told them.

‘She was shouting at us, everyone was listening in, and I thought “How embarrassing is this?”,’ Mr Gerondis told the newspaper.

Mr Smith said Miss Yates went ‘berserk’, drinking a bottle of vodka at a luxury apartment she had checked into.

‘It was a circus getting her in and out,’ said Mr Gerondis. ‘We could not talk to her for a while because she was so upset.’

Mr
 Smith said nothing would convince Miss Yates that Hutchence had taken 
his own life. ‘She was just adamant that she wanted her child growing up
 believing that it was an accidental death by auto-eroticism, instead of
 the fact that he killed himself because he wanted to see his child,’ he
 said.

The two police 
officers said they were convinced that it was an argument with Geldof on
 the phone that day that had resulted in him plunging into depression.

Mr
 Gerondis said the row and the involvement of drugs meant that ‘nothing 
was working’ for Hutchence that night. He rang his agent and said: ‘I’ve
 had enough.’

The singer’s 
devastated family asked police to hand over personal items collected 
from the hotel room, including the partially-written song. But it all 
went to the executor of Hutchence’s will, Hong Kong accountant Colin 
Diamond, and it is unknown what happened to the song. Hutchence’s family
 received no money from his estate.

Miss Yates died of a heroin overdose in 2000. Geldof has brought up Tiger Lily along with their other three daughters.

Band: The INXS frontman, here with the band, is believed to have scraped through a bin in search of cocaine during his final hours before penning his last lyrics. It is not know what happened to that song
