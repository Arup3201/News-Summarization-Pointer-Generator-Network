President Barack Obama is seeking an increase in taxes on the wealthiest Americans by raising the capital gains rate and eliminating a tax break on inheritances, then using the revenue to fund new tax credits and other cost-saving measures for the middle class.

The president's proposals are to be announced during Tuesday's State of the Union address. 

They are likely to be cheered by liberal Democrats and considered non-starters with the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill.

Tax increase: President Obama plans to call for billions in tax increases on top earners  in order to fund new tax credits and other measures the White House claims will help the middle class

The president’s address is intended to lay out an agenda for his final two years in office and help the Democrats retain the White House in the 2016 election with a legacy of policies that appeal to middle- and lower-income voters, who continued to lose ground as the economy rebounded from the recession. 

The proposal's centerpiece is an increase in the capital gains rate, to 28 percent, on couples making more than $500,000 per year.

The tax rate for capital gains now stands at 20% for the highest-earning Americans.

Obama will ask lawmakers to close a loophole allowing capital gains on inherited funds to go untaxed -- a so-called "trust fund" loophole the White House says allows billions of dollars in capital gains to go untapped by the government every year. 

The administration’s proposal would exempt the first $200,000 in capital gains per couple plus $500,000 for a home, along with all personal property except for valuable art and collectibles. The rest would be treated for income-tax purposes as if it had been sold.

The total amount of money raised for the government by these actions would be about $210 billion over 10 years, 

According to the White House, 99 percent of the tax burden from the capital-gains proposals would be paid by the top 1 percent of households, and more than 80 percent would be paid by the top 0.1 percent.

People with significant amounts of unrealized gains include founders of successful businesses and others who inherited businesses decades ago.

The moves -- likely to meet resistance from Republicans in Congress -- are meant to pay for the long slate of new programs the President began laying out two weeks ago designed to bolster the middle class, including offering two free years of community college to qualified students.

Obama's aides have been seeking ways to expand a robust economic recovery beyond top earners, who have been buoyed by record closes on Wall Street. Despite reams of positive economic news, most Americans still say economic conditions in the country are only fair.

Obama is set to propose Tuesday a $500 tax credit for married couples who each hold jobs; the intention, officials say, is to help alleviate the costs of child care and commuting that lead some spouses -- usually women -- to determine it makes more financial sense to stop working.

He'll also spell out ways to simplify the way taxpayers apply for education and child care credits, including increasing the top child care credit to $3,000.

The total cost for the new provisions: $235 billion,

Obama has spent the last two weeks offering up an advance look at his State of the Union address, including the community college proposal, a plan to expand high-speed Internet and reducing rates of federally backed mortgages.

 In addition to the tax plan, he said he will push Congress for legislation allowing workers to earn seven days of paid sick leave per year and make community free for millions of students, at a cost of $60 billion over 10 years.

The early look is meant to introduce Americans to each scheme individually, said administration aides, who determined the yearly laundry-list of plans -- combined with updates on America's foreign policy -- wasn't digestible during a single prime-time event.
