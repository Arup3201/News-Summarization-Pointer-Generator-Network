Sportsmail cricket writer Lawrence Booth's view of day one of the fourth Test between England and India at Old Trafford in which the tourists were bowled over by Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson, ending their first innings on 152. England, meanwhile, were 113-3 at stumps.

BEWARE HISTORY

England were jubilant at reducing India to 8 for 4.

But the last three times they took four wickets in the first innings before the score reached 25, they have lost: against Pakistan (21 for 4) in Dubai in 2011-12; South Africa (21 for 4) at Headingley in 2003; and New Zealand (19 for 4) at Auckland in 2001-02.

FRED DID FOR INDIA

Only twice before have India lost their first four wickets in a Test innings for fewer runs than this. In 1952, Fred Trueman and Alec Bedser reduced them to 0 for 4 at Headingley. 

Later in the same series at The Oval, the pair were at it again, having India 6 for 4.

BROAD’S BIG LEAP

Stuart Broad took a giant leap up the all-time Test wicket-taking list with his 6 for 25, from 255 to 261. He passed his old friend and team-mate Graeme Swann (255), West Indies giant Joel Garner and Australian quick Jason Gillespie (both 259).
