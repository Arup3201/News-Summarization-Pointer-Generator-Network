It was once a grand music hall which hosted huge stars Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. But now this historic Victorian music hall has dwindled to a crumbling wreck.

The Palace Theatre in Plymouth, Devon, drew some of greatest names in show-business in its heyday. After opening in 1898, the Flemish 
Renaissance-style theatre hosted the likes of Chaplin and Gracie Fields -
 but its ornate splendour is long gone.

The
 plaster friezes and ornamental cherubs are now coated in a thick layer 
of dust and the floor is covered with debris and broken glass. Laurel
 and Hardy can still be seen smiling down from a battered painting on 
the tiered auditorium which originally seated 1,440 theatre-goers.

The legendary duo performed at the Palace in 1954 but their week-long run was cut short after one night when Oliver Hardy had a severe bout of flu and a mild heart attack. The Palace was built for the 
Livermore Brothers as a music hall, forming part of a development which 
included the adjoining Grand Western Hotel.

The Grade II listed building was one of the few Victorian properties to survive the devastating blitz of World War Two.  In 1983 the curtain finally came down on the theatre for the last time. It
 was given a new lease of life after it was turned into a wrestling club
 and bingo hall before being reborn in 1996 as the Dance Academy 
nightclub.

But it has remained empty since 2006 when police targeted it in a massive drugs sting. Former
 club boss Manoucehr Bahmanzadeh, who bought the property for £550,000, 
was jailed for allowing the building to be used for the supply of 
Class A drugs. He was also ordered to hand over £1million under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

Bahmanzadeh,
 who has since been released from prison, has previously offered to give
 the venue away to an Islamic charity so it can be turned into a mosque. The Palace features on the 'at risk' building lists published by English Heritage and the Victorian Society.

A
 spokesman for Bahmanzadeh said: 'We are speaking to English Heritage, 
the Heritage Lottery Fund and Plymouth City Council about raising funds 
to put it right.'

The paintwork is faded and peeling, and rubbish litters the floor. The building, built in the 19th century, is on the English Heritage's 'risk' list

Once a stalwart of Plymouth, the old theatre - which was used as a bingo hall and a nightclub - has been closed since 2006
