Arsene Wenger is confident of concluding a deal for Barcelona forward Alexis Sanchez on Wednesday - and two more players could follow in a £50m spree.

The Chile star has opted for the Gunners ahead of Liverpool and Juventus and his representatives are in London to agree personal terms and conclude the deal.

Sanchez is set to be offered a similar package to top-earner Mesut Ozil, who is paid £140,000 a week. Arsenal will meet Barcelona’s £30m valuation, allowing the Spanish side to complete a £75m deal for Liverpool forward Luis Suarez.

An £11m move for Newcastle defender Mathieu Debuchy is almost complete and an £8m swoop for QPR striker Loic Remy is held up only by his personal terms.

Sportsmail understands Remy, who earns £75,000 a week at Loftus Road, and Arsenal are still some distance apart on terms but Debuchy is on the brink of completing his protracted switch to the Emirates after having a medical on Monday.

He will replace Bacary Sagna, who has joined Manchester City, as the club’s first-choice right back.
