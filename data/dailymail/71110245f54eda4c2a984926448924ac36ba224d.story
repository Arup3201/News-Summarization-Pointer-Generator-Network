Uber driver Adnan Nafasat has been charged with kidnap and sexual assault in Chicago

A driver for the ride-sharing service Uber has been charged with kidnapping and sexually assaulting a male passenger in Chicago.

Cook County prosecutors said that 46-year-old Adnan Nafasat, a married father-of-three from suburban Villa Park, overpowered and choked a 21-year-old passenger during a July 31 attack.

Assistant State's Attorney Jennifer Cooper said at a bond hearing on Wednesday that Nafasat refused the man's pleas to take him home. 

According to the Sun-Times, Nafasat had managed to get the young man to sit in the front of the car by telling him that the back seat was dirty and broken after picking him up in the early hours in the Boystown area. 

The 46-year-old allegedly groped and choked his passenger to the point of unconsciousness before driving to a neighborhood he did not know.

He then allegedly became violent, kissing the man, exposing himself and trying to force him into a sex act. 

The attack only stopped when the victim begged the driver to take him home. 

The driver's attorney, Carey Crimmins, said in court that Nafasat owns a business and drives to supplement his income.

Nafasat was ordered held in lieu of $150,000 bail.

Uber spokeswoman Jennifer Mullin says the company has removed Nafasat from its platform and is assisting investigators.

It was the second time in two weeks that a driver was charged with sexually assaulting an Uber passenger in Chicago. 

Maxime Fohounhedo was not authorized to drive for the ride-sharing company and used an account created in his wife's name to pick up customers, the company last month.

San Francisco-based Uber has come under scrutiny over its driver screening process, including from prosecutors in California who filed a lawsuit in December accusing Uber of exaggerating how comprehensive its background checks are. 

Uber said Fohounhedo was driving under an account created in his wife's name in violation of Uber's rules prohibiting account sharing. Prosecutors said he used his own photo and phone number on the account. 

Uber driver Maxime Fohounhedo was also charged with sexually assaulting a female passenger in Chicago in the last month

Uber spokeswoman Jennifer Mullin couldn't immediately explain how that discrepancy could have been missed during the application process or despite what she said were Uber's 'regular re-checks' of driver photos.

'We do our best to send drivers though our background check process, which far exceeds what's expected of taxis,' she said. 

'But there is also a responsibility for the rider to make sure that when they get into an Uber that they're checking the license plate and they're checking the driver's face and making sure all that matches up.'

In this case, though, such scrutiny by the rider might not have helped because Fohounhedo's own photo would have showed up on the user's smartphone, Mullin acknowledged.

The Uber app allows smartphone users to search for rides from regular taxis, limos and private individuals such as Fohounhedo who use their own vehicles in an arrangement known as ride-sharing.

Fohounhedo was arrested on December 28 and has been charged with sexual assault in an alleged attack in November. A judge ordered him held Tuesday in lieu of $500,000 bail.

The 22-year-old victim told police she was attacked between 3am and 4am after being picked up from a bar.

Assistant State's Attorney Robert Mack said the woman was intoxicated and woke up on a couch at the driver's apartment with the man sexually assaulting her. Afterward, he told the victim, 'I made you happy,' Mack said.

Public defender Sandra Bennewitz told reporters Fohounhedo 'has evidence that will support his claim that he did not do this and that whatever happened was consensual'.

Fohounhedo would not have been eligible to drive for Uber in Chicago, where regulations require ride-share applicants to have held a license for at least a year. Fohounhedo has only held a temporary Illinois visitor driver's license since August, according to the Illinois Secretary of State's office. His wife, however, has had a regular Illinois license since 2009.

Uber says its background checks screen would-be drivers against county, federal and multi-state records going back seven years.

It also cites records showing several hundred physical violence complaints against traditional taxi drivers in recent years in Chicago.
