A cellist who had his memory almost completely wiped out by a serious brain infection stunned doctors because he is still able to remember music.

The German, who played for a famous orchestra, was barely able to recall anything about his life before 2005.

But despite being struck down by the condition which affects just one in half a million people, he was able to recognise the scale and rhythm of music he was played.

Brain virus: The German, known only as PM, suffered from herpesviral encephaliti and had his memory almost completely wiped

In tests his musical memory was classified as 'normal' - even though the rest of his brain was so badly affected he could not remember the layout of his flat, the Guardian reported.

The 71-year-old - known only as PM - has continued to play his cello in his own home.

He suffered from an infection called herpesviral encephalitis which is extremely difficult to treat. The virus travels along nerves before getting into the brain.

Neurologist Carsten Finke, based at Charite University Hospital, Berlin, said the case is significant as it could give doctors a new insight into how memories are stored.

The case is similar to that of Clive Wearing, a conductor who was also hit by the virus. He is still able to play music despite remembering very little before he suffered from the rare condition in 1985.

Neurologist Mr Finke told the Guardian that PM had effectively lost everything apart from his knowledge of music.

'He can hardly remember a thing. He has no memory of any personal or professional events,' he said.

'He is living in the moment, more or less. He has lost his whole life.'

PM's brother and care worker were the only people he could recognise.

The medial temporal lobes, used to remember important information, were very badly damaged by the virus.

Mr Finke, speaking at a Society for Neuroscience event in Washington, said the case suggests that music is stored in a different part of the brain to other memories.

Doctors played PM music he was familiar with before he was struck down by the virus in 2005. They then played him more recent work.

Asked which he knew better, the cellist said said 93 per cent of the time it was the older music.

However, when the newer music was later replayed to PM he said he was 'familiar' with it in 77 per cent of cases.

Doctors are hopeful that they will be able to harness the cellist's ability to recall music as he recovers from the virus.

It is thought it may be possible to use music to get him to perform certain tasks - such as taking his medication.
