The owners of a rare antique steam engine could face a £100,000 repair bill after the machine slipped off the back of a lorry and was badly damaged.

The 21-tonne Fowler engine, named the 'Giant Panther', which was made in 1917, missed an electric pylon by inches after falling off the low loader as it went around a blind bend.

The ploughing engine's flywheel, boiler and steering mechanism were damaged in the accident in Crays Hill, Billericay, Essex.

The 21-tonne steam engine Giant Panther, which dates back to 1917, was 
badly damaged after falling from the back of a lorry as it drove around a blind corner in Billericay, 
Essex

The engine's flywheel, boiler and steering were damaged in the crash and could cost up
 to £100,000 to repair, according to Barleylands Farm, which owns the 
vehicle

The lorry was driving the engine back from the Essex Young Farmers' 
Country Show, near Chelmsford, where it had made its first appearance since 
being lovingly restored by the farm

Barleylands Farm, which owns the ploughing engine, had spent five years restoring the historic engine to working condition before the crash.

The farm owners also restored its sister engine, The Giant Tiger, also dating back to 1917, which works in tandem with the Giant Panther.

Spokesman Jenny Sparkes told MailOnline that the steam engine - which must work in a pair - arrived back to the farm this morning and a mechanic was starting repair work today.

She said: 'The engine has pride of place in our show every year. We don't know the exact damage but we are expecting to look at around £100,000. 

'The plan is to repair it if we can and we are hoping to have it fixed by the time of the Essex County Show, in September.

'The engines work in a pair so must go together. Although there are more ploughing machines around, it is so rare to get the exact pair so we really hope we can get it working again.'

The crash took place around 7.30pm, but the machine was not recovered 
for another five hours because those removing it had to be so careful not to do further damage to the antique model

The drama 
unfolded on Sunday evening as the steam engine was being brought back 
from the Essex Young Farmers' Country Show, near Chelmsford, where it 
made its first appearance since being restored.

After the crash, four cranes worked through the night to recover the steam engine.

Because of its age, recovery workers had to treat the machine delicately to ensure there was no further damage. It was finally moved at 1.30am the following morning.

Mike Kirby, 59, who lives close to where the accident took place, told The Brentwood Gazette: 'I was standing in the lounge looking out the window and saw it coming round the corner.

'The next minute there was a crash and it fell off. I came straight out and it was steaming.

The steam engine is one of two ploughing engines owned by the farm which owners hope will make an appearance at the Essex County Show in 
September

The rare vehicle works in tandem with its sister engine, The Giant Tiger, which has also been restored by the farm. Both vehicles work to plough a field, one pulling from the left and the other pulling from the right

The Giant Panther is one of the ploughing machines famously created by John Fowler in Leeds.

There are still around 3,000 Fowler machines in preservation.

Of these, it is believed a few hundreds are ploughing engines, although it is believed there are just a handful that were also made in 1917.

The two-gear engine, labelled as the 14729, works in tandem with its sister engine The Giant Tiger, which also dates back to 1917 and is labelled as the 14728.

Located on either side of a field, the engines are designed to pull a plough, or a scoop on a cable, backwards and forwards across a paddock, travelling at around 4mph.

The engines are identical 
except that one engine pulled the rope from the right and the other from
 the left.

The paired engine system was developed 
because the heavy traction engines caused the soil to be heavily compressed if driven across a paddock pulling a plough.

'I was concerned someone was hurt so I went to see if the driver was okay and he was alright. A few people called 999 to get the police out.

'It was a nightmare - they had four really big cranes and the road blocked off. It was very lucky that no one was on the verge and that it didn’t take any power lines down with it.

'Everyone was down here – no less than 50 people with the road closed off.'

As well as damage to the vehicle, the kerb, a chevron sign and the grass verge were all damaged.

Passerby David De’ath of Queens Park, Billericay, said: 'It will have done a lot of damage to the engine. Luckily it fell onto the grass verge rather than the road and no one was walking on it.'

A police spokesman said: 'Officers attended and assisted with traffic management. The road was subsequently closed completely while the steam engine was recovered. It was fully reopened at 1.30am.

'Essex Highways were also notified about the incident due to suspected damage to the road surface.'
