The Welcome to Vanchester billboard that appeared on Monday was the work of a bookmaker and not, it has to be said, anything to do with Manchester United or their new manager Louis van Gaal.

The Dutchman is pictured in triumphant pose, mimicking the poster dedicated to Carlos Tevez by Manchester City which caused more than its fair share of commotion after the forward swapped Old Trafford for the Etihad five years ago.

Monday's imitation might have been little more than a publicity stunt, but the timing could not have been better because the moment has come for Van Gaal to make his mark in Manchester too.

After leading his team from one coast of America to the other — a commercially-driven venture that did not go down particularly well with him — the 63-year-old will take his place in the Old Trafford dugout for the first time on Tuesday when they face Valencia in their final pre-season friendly.

In four days’ time, Swansea are the visitors for the opening Premier League game of the season and the Van Gaal era will begin in earnest.

After getting to work on overhauling the coaching staff, playing squad and formation at United, he must now set about rebuilding the fortress established under Sir Alex Ferguson, whose Theatre of Dreams became the stuff of nightmares for David Moyes during his ill-fated spell.

Not only did the likes of City, Liverpool and Tottenham walk away from Old Trafford with three points, it turned into a happy hunting ground for West Brom, Everton, Newcastle and Sunderland —teams who previously had never given themselves a prayer at United — as records tumbled.

United went out of both domestic cups at home and the fear factor that had gripped opponents for so long was suddenly transmitted to them.

That it is not something Van Gaal will tolerate. Already he appears to have re-established a winning mentality in a group aware of the price of failure.

It would be dangerous to read too much into pre-season, but United have won all five games under their new boss, including matches against Real Madrid, Liverpool and Roma.

Valencia are next and the fact Van Gaal has had his opponents scouted indicates he is treating it as more than a friendly. United are expecting a crowd in excess of 60,000, although tickets were still available over the weekend so there are no guarantees the game will be a sellout.

New signings Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw are set to make their home debuts but Van Gaal is unlikely to risk Robin van Persie, Marouane Fellaini and Adnan Januzaj after all three players had extra time off following the World Cup.

The United boss met with Fellaini over the weekend and it is understood the Belgium midfielder has not been told outright he will be sold. However, Van Gaal made it clear the £27.5million signing from Everton last summer will not be first choice and the possibility of a move to Napoli remains.

Uncertain future: Marouane Fellaini could yet leave the club amid interest from Napoli
