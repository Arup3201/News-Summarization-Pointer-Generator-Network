A mom charged with killing her daughter in a brutal scissor attack has pleaded not guilty on grounds of insanity.

Danielle Yvonne Slaughter, 27, claims she heard the 6-year-old speak and laugh in what she later told police was an 'evil voice'.

Slaughter spoke clearly while answering the judge's questions and entering her plea during a brief arraignment in Clark County District Court on Thursday.

Evil: Police say that Danielle Yvonne Slaughter killed her 6-year-old daughter with scissors, because she used 'evil words'

Judge Melisa De La Garza ordered Slaughter to appear for trial on May 16. She was refused bail and faces life in prison if convicted.

Slaughter was found by police running naked and covered in blood through Las Vegas on March 11, according to court documents. 

Drugged: Slaughter had been taking diet pills and was unable to sleep

She told officers the blood on her hands was the ‘lamb of God’ and asked 'Did I kill my daughter?' Is she dead?’

Police went to Slaughter’s house, where her six-year-old daughter, Kayla Franks, was found dead.

The
mom told police she had been having trouble sleeping since she began 
taking slimming pill Hydroxycut four days earlier, a drug which was 
temporarily withdrawn from the market in 2009 over liver damage fears.

She said she had felt an evil presence in her home for several days, adding that it was not something she had experienced before.

In a police interview she told how she and her daughter were sitting on the bed when the girl spoke in 'evil words', laughed 'in an evil voice' and clawed and kicked at her. 

Slaughter said she picked up scissors and struck the child several times.

She added that she had slept for just one hour the previous night.

Homicide Lt. Ray Steiber said: ‘There was no rhyme or reason to it. I don't think there's anything that anyone could have anticipated.’

Jailed: Police found Slaughter running naked and bloodied in Las Vegas. She was held at the Clark County jail (pictured) pending an initial court appearance.

He added police believe that Slaughter was sleep-deprived and may have been affected by the diet pills she had been taking.

Her
lawyer, deputy Clark County Public Defender Andrea Luem, said she isn't
contesting Slaughter's competency for trial. Instead, Slaughter is 
claiming temporary insanity.

Ms Luem said on Thursday it was too early to tell if lack of sleep and taking the dietary supplement had any effect on the killing.
