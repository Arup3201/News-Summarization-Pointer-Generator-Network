A Dallas woman faces up to 20 years in federal prison for her role in the overdose death of a 19-year-old apparent first-time heroin user.

Rian Lashley, whose teenage YouTube debut revealed a talented and beautiful singer rife with potential, died in March 2014 after a stripper's implausible attempt to rob her of $3,000 went terribly wrong.

That stripper, Cierra Rounds, gave her disgusting account of the ill-fated plot in court on Tuesday as she pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance.

Sad: 19-year-old Rian Lashley was killed in an attempt to rob her by injecting her with heroin that went terribly wrong, prosecutors say. Dallas stripper Cierra Rounds, right, revealed in court Tuesday the calamitous chain of events that led to Lashley's demise

The trouble began when Rounds, along with some of her friends, met with the young woman at a Plano, Texas IHOP in order to sell her $100 worth of heroin.

While they ate, the New York Daily News reports, Rounds and her friend Kathryn Dirks, 25, came to discover that Lashley was carrying $3,000 cash ion her purse.

Rounds soon reached out to her drug dealer, identified as J.C. or Jaymo, NBCDFW reports, and the plan was hatched.

'I figured ud (sic) want me on this money,' Rounds texted J.C.

The trio then drove to a home in Dallas. J.C. told Rounds via text message to keep Lashley there.

'Ima bout (sic) to shoot her up for her first time,' Rounds said.

At the home, prosecutors say Rounds and Dirks, at Lashley's request, injected heroin into the teen.

China White: The 19-year-old had never done heroin. She was sold three bags of China White by Rounds' cohort Glen Brunton, according to prosecutors

Later that afternoon, Lashley began to appear distressed. Rounds said Tuesday that they then put the teen in a bathtub of ice water in order to try to counteract the heroin.

She appeared to go to sleep thereafter and died that afternoon. An autopsy revealed her death was due to heroin overdose.

Dirks and a man to whom J.C. gave the heroin to sell to Lashley, 28-year-old Glen Brunton, were indicted on drugs charges last year, the Dallas Morning News reports.

Brunton goes to trial in April. Dirks is still a fugitive. 

Rounds remains jailed pending sentencing and faces a $1 million fine along with her potential jail time. 

She returns to court in September.
