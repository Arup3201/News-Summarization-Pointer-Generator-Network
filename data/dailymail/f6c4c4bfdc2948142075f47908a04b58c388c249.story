Unleashing the full might of the justice system on a Lithuanian for the theft of two 10p plastic bags might, even in itself, have seemed a little heavy handed.

But when the justice system then got into a muddle over the difference between a Lithuanian and a Latvian, the case descended into farce.

The prosecution of Tadas Tarkutis, 26, for stealing two supermarket ‘bags for life’ has ended up costing taxpayers £5,000 – after a blunder in which the wrong translator was sent to court.

Tadas Tarkutis, 26, was arrested after he swiped two 'bags for life', costing 10p each, from a Sainsbury's store in Scarborough, North Yorkshire

The Lithuanian national was arrested for the theft from Sainsbury’s on Wednesday last week and detained by police.

But
 when he went to court the following day, a Latvian-speaking interpreter
 was accidentally sent instead of a  Lithuanian speaker and the hearing 
had to be postponed. Tarkutis then spent a second night in custody 
before returning to Scarborough Magistrates’ Court for another hearing, 
after a translator who spoke the correct language had been found.

A
 court source commented afterwards: ‘It’s like someone somewhere had 
just picked out a country that begins with “L”. It’s ridiculous.’

By this time the estimated bill for keeping Tarkutis in custody and dealing with his case had risen to around £3,000.

He admitted stealing the bags from the supermarket in Scarborough, North Yorkshire.

But
 because he was in breach of a suspended sentence for a previous crime 
he was jailed for six weeks – of which he will serve half – adding a 
further £2,000 to the public’s bill for holding him in prison.

He was not ordered to pay any contribution to court costs or for the stolen 10p bags.

The trial of Tadas Tarkutis, 26, ended up costing £3,000 after the wrong translator was hired for his appearance at Scarborough Magistrates' Court (above)

The
 Crown Prosecution Service said the jail sentence validated its decision
 to bring the case to court. Tarkutis’s previous offence, for which he 
was given the suspended jail term, was not revealed but is believed to 
be theft.

After the case, 
Andy Silvester of the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘Criminals must always 
be brought to justice, but this seems a remarkable amount of taxpayers’ 
money to spend on a rather minor case.

‘Ordinary
 people rightly expect justice, but they don’t expect it to cost over 
the odds. Avoidable errors have only put the cost up more.’

After
 Tarkutis – a Lithuanian national said to have been living in Birmingham
 – was arrested for stealing the bags, officers summoned a Lithuanian 
translator to make the 60-mile trip from Harrogate to Scarborough to 
enable him to be questioned.

The
 interpreter spent around four hours with him before returning home. But
 the same person was not available to translate for him in court the 
following morning, and Capita TI, the translation services firm 
contracted to provide interpreters for court cases, sent a 
Latvian-speaking woman instead.

Due
 to a shortage of Latvian speakers, this interpreter made a 160-mile, 
three-hour trip from Rugby in Warwickshire, only to discover she 
couldn’t do the job.

Magistrates realised what had happened and apologised, before advising the translator to ensure she still got paid.

Tarkutis
 spent another night in police custody, and when he was brought back to 
court on Friday a Lithuanian interpreter had finally been found.

Yesterday
 a Capita spokesman blamed police for the blunder: ‘Capita Translation 
and Interpreting supplied a Latvian interpreter on May 29 because the 
police booked a Latvian interpreter.

‘When the magistrates’ court realised the error they informed us that a Lithuanian interpreter was required instead.  

‘We therefore supplied a Lithuanian interpreter on May 30.’

A
 North Yorkshire Police spokesman said: ‘We will be working with Capita 
to look into the full circumstances as to why the wrong interpreter 
attended court.’

Official 
figures released last month show the cost to the taxpayer of hiring 
court interpreters under the outsourcing deal has almost doubled to 
£15.5million in just one year.

There
 are around 11,000 foreign nationals in UK prisons – about 13 per cent 
of the total population – and many require interpreters at court 
hearings and appeals.
