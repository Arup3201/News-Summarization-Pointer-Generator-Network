A retired couple  have been slapped with a noise abatement notice by the council after their neighbours complained that their guinea fowl were too loud.

Owners Maurice Dainty, 69, and his wife Phyllis, 71, keep 34 of the birds at their home in the quiet village of Scorton, North Lancashire, as well as a dozen ducks and a few chickens.

But after 15 years of keeping the animals in their gardens, their new neighbours complained to Wyre Council that the flock are too noisy. 

Ruffled feathers: Phyllis and Maurice Dainty have been told they have to move their guinea fowl because they are too noisy, following a complaint from their neighbours

After an inspection by the council, the couple received not one, but four letters from the local authority, telling them they had 21 days to move the guinea fowl.  

The couple, who have been married for 49 years, have just 10 days to go until the birds have to be moved or they face a fine of up to £5,000.

Mr Dainty, a former farm worker, and his wife have been warned the case could be taken to the High Court if necessary to secure 'the abatement, prohibition or restriction of the nuisance'.

Speaking to MailOnline, an upset Mrs Dainty said: 'We have to move the birds somehow or else. The council have offered to help but they said they would charge.

'We can't move them anyway as we don't have any more space. The ducks are noisier than the guinea fowl anyway. 

'We're both just fed up of it. We'll never be friends with neighbours like that. It's very awkward.' 

Mr Dainty said: 'Everyone thinks it’s a joke. It’s got past the joking stage.

'I’m 69 and Phyllis is 71 - we’ve never had anything like it in our lives. We are not going to part with them.'

The couple say they will write to Defra and the National Farmers' Union to see if either body can help.  

Fowl play: The retired couple were given 21 days to move their birds or face a fine of up to £5,000

Planning consultant and family friend Mel Lawrenson said: 'There is a clay pigeon shoot in the next field and they are less than a mile away from the motorway and there are cows and sheep all around.

'They are a registered smallholding - they are allowed to keep these things.'

The abatement notice was dated October 1, and gave the family 21 days to move the birds or appeal to a magistrates' court. 

The council has advised the couple to increase the distance between the guinea fowl and the house next door, or relocate them away from the properties. 

Rebecca Cavies, from Wyre Council’s environmental protection service, wrote to the Daintys, stating: 'Evidence gathered during our investigations has established the existence of a ‘statutory nuisance’ due to noise from guinea fowl.' 

The Dainty's next door neighbours, Helen and Richard Leach, moved in just over a year ago and were behind the complaint. They declined to comment. 

A spokeswoman for Wyre Council said: 'The council is currently investigating a case of noise nuisance at this location.

'It would not be appropriate to comment further.'
