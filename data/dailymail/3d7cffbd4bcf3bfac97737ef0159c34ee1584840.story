A former smoker is demanding the Government puts her picture on cigarette packets as a health warning - after she had to have both her legs amputated because of her 20-a-day habit.

Victoria Marks, 41, had her first cigarette when she was 13 and smoked heavily through her teens and twenties.

The mother-of-four gave up ten years ago when she was 31, but by then had developed a rare and devastating form of thrombosis called Buerger’s disease.

Victoria Marks, 41, had to have both of her legs amputated after developing a rare smoking-related form of thrombosis. The condition means her limbs are slowly starved of oxygen, causing the tissue to die

Mrs Marks (pictured marrying husband Scott in 2004) has Buerger's disease. It is feared she will eventually lose her arms as well as her legs

The condition slowly starved Mrs Marks’ limbs of blood, meaning both her legs had to be amputated - and her arms could be next.

The former barmaid now has to use a wheelchair and is so desperate to spare others the same anguish that she wants to see photos of her ravaged body on the side of cigarette packets.

Mrs Marks, who lives in Liskeard, Cornwall, with husband Scott, 42, and youngest daughter Beth, 11, said: ‘There needs to be more done to inform people of the dangers of smoking - and not just the major diseases, but the rare and life-changing ones too.

‘If anything, the government should put pictures of real people like me on the side of cigarette packets if they really want the message about smoking to hit home.

‘Young people would relate far more to stories like mine than they would to a picture of clogged up lungs.’

Ms Marks was 26 when she first suffered pain in her legs and swelling in her ankles but she put it down to long shifts and being on her feet all day behind the bar.

Mrs Marks (pictured with husband, Scott) believes her condition was linked to her 20-a-day smoking habit. She started smoking when she was 13 and gave up when she was 31

The pain got worse over the following years and she decided to get it checked out and, after months of tests, was diagnosed with Buerger’s disease.

By May 2006, with Ms Marks in excruciating pain and unable to walk, medics decided to amputate her lower left leg.

A week after the operation she developed an infection and doctors had to remove more of the limb above the knee.

Buerger's disease causes inflammation of the blood vessels in the legs and arms.

It leads to narrowing and blockage of the blood vessels so blood flow to the limbs is reduced.

This initially causes pain but can eventually lead to tissue death.

If the tissue dies, amputation can be required.

The cause of Buerger's disease is not known but it is linked to smoking.

The most important step a person can take to avoid the disease, or to stop it worsening, is to stop smoking.

The disease is rare but it is more common in men than women.

Treatment involves antibiotics for infections and taking painkillers.

Surgery may be required to amputate dead tissue.

Most people with the disease avoid amputation if they give up smoking when they are diagnosed.

After coming to terms with her illness and learning to walk with a prosthetic limb, Mrs Marks started feeling similar pains in her right leg in December 2012.

Her doctor called her an ambulance and within hours a consultant had broken the news that the tissue was dead and she risked gangrene if the limb wasn’t removed immediately.

Surgeons amputated her leg above the knee the same day.

Buerger’s disease causes chronic inflammation of the blood vessels, which narrows the arteries and eventually damages and kills tissue in the limbs.

The cause is unknown but medics say the use of tobacco is a key factor and it normally only occurs in men aged over 45.

Mrs Marks says that, like most people, she had not come across Buerger’s disease before her bombshell diagnosis.

She said: ‘I’d never heard of the disease before and there wasn’t much information about it online.

‘It wasn’t until a year later that I discovered that the condition affected smokers and the best thing to do would be to quit the habit.

‘It was the push I needed to stop the addiction and I haven’t touched a single cigarette since.

‘But it was too late, the damage was done. I gave up smoking ten years ago but had my first amputation three years later.

Mrs Marks now requires round-the-clock care and her husband has had to give up work to look after her

‘I’m always on tenterhooks waiting for the day when I have to have my arms amputated too. Every little pain I feel in my arms, I worry and panic.’

Mrs Marks used to enjoy coastal walks and bike rides with her husband and Beth, and her older children Chris, 24, Charlotte, 22, and Jack, 20.

Now a wheelchair user, she relies on Mr Marks as her round-the-clock carer and needs Beth to help with the cooking and housework.

She has undergone 14 separate operations in the past decade but there is no known cure for her condition.

She and her husband believe every 
single consequence of smoking should be listed on cigarette packets - 
not just the obvious illnesses like heart disease and lung cancer.

Mrs Marks said: ‘I have no doubt that Buerger’s disease was caused by smoking.

‘By the age of 18 I was addicted and smoking 20 fags a day. I knew it was bad for me, but I kept telling myself that I would give up when I was older.

‘If I read and seen that smoking could lead to the amputation of my legs as a 13-year-old girl. I would have stopped there and then.

Mrs Marks (pictured in 1997) is aware that there is worse to come as her condition continues to worsen

‘At that age you are vain and you care more about the way you look than your health.

‘Putting more people like me on the cover of the cigarette packets will raise awareness of the dangers of putting a cigarette in your mouth.’

Mr Marks, who quit his job as a fireman to look after his wife, added: ‘We have got worse to come and it’s going to kill her eventually.

‘It’s been very difficult - she doesn’t get up much and she can’t get about. She can’t be a mother to her daughter.’
