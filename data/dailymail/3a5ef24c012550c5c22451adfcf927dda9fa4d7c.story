An overflow crowd in a Southern California community where protesters turned back Homeland Security busloads of immigrants gave a harsh reception to federal officials behind the decision to bring them to Murrieta in the first place.

Local politicians calling for secure borders proved far more popular with the crowd Wednesday night.

'Send them back! Send the back!' the special-meeting crowd chanted, shouting down Chief Border Patrol Agent Paul Beeson after he took responsibility for transferring the Central American children and families to Murrieta from Texas, where the numbers are too much for facilities to handle.

On Tuesday, the buses were rerouted an hour south to San Diego after they were met with flag-waving protesters in Murrieta.

The latest protest comes as President Barack Obama attempted to use a White House citizenship ceremony to regain control of the immigration debate.

'If we want to keep attracting the best and the brightest from beyond our shores, we’re going to have fix our immigration system, which is broken, and pass common-sense immigration reform,' Obama said at the ceremony today, according to The Washington Times.

The Wednesday night crowd gathered at a high school auditorium that seats 750 in the desert city of 100,000 people, groaned when Beeson said four of the immigrants had to be hospitalized, two with scabies and two with fevers.

And Beeson conceded that he did not know where Tuesday's immigrants nor several more waves slated to arrive from Texas in coming days will end up.

'We will make decisions when they arrive where it makes the most sense to put them,' he said.

The federal government is working to deal with a flood of Central American children and families fleeing to the United States.

More than 52,000 unaccompanied children have been detained after crossing the Texas-Mexico border since October in what President Barack Obama has called a humanitarian crisis.

Many are under the impression that they will receive leniency from U.S. authorities.

Murrieta Mayor Alan Long, who urged locals to oppose the immigrant transfer plan before it began, said the city will track any spending it does over the issue and send a "big fat bill" to Washington.

'Change needs to occur at the federal level in many ways,' he said to a loud ovation.

Riverside County Supervisor Jeff Stone, was wildly cheered after calling for secure borders and denouncing what he called the "exploitation" by the federal government of the traumatized women and children immigrants.

Another group of roughly 140 immigrants arrived from Texas for processing on Wednesday, but they were sent to El Centro more than 140 miles away and were met without incident.

Obama used a naturalization ceremony for active duty service members and civilians to address the issue.

'I’m going to keep doing everything I 
can to make our immigration system smarter and more efficient,' 
President Obama said at the White House ceremony today.

The
 politically divisive immigration issue is earning renewed attention 
after the influx of tens of the unaccompanied children from Central 
America who, under U.S. law, must be sent back across the border to 
their home countries.

That has upset advocates of overhauling U.S. immigration policy who want Obama to allow the children to stay.

At the same time, Obama blames House Republicans for delaying action on an immigration overhaul.

A
 comprehensive measure the Senate passed last year has been blocked by 
House leaders who also have done little to advance legislative proposals
 of their own.

Obama 
announced earlier this week that, as a result of lawmakers' inaction, he
 will pursue non-legislative ways that he can adjust U.S. immigration 
policy without waiting for Congress to act.

Obama
 and his wife, Michelle, spent the Fourth of July with service members 
they invited to the White House for an all-American barbecue on the 
South Lawn and choice seating for the fireworks on the National Mall.

Obama said some of the service members are unique.

'They signed up to serve, to sacrifice, potentially to give their lives for the security of this country even though they weren't yet Americans. That's how much they love this country,' Obama said in announcing the ceremony earlier this week.

'They were prepared to fight and die for an America they did not yet fully belong to. I think they've earned their stripes in more ways than one.'

He said it is worth celebrating that the U.S. is 'a nation of immigrants.'

'We won this country's freedom together. We built this country together. We defended this country together,' he said.

'It makes us special. It makes us strong. It makes us Americans. That's worth celebrating. And that's what I want not just House Republicans, but all of us, as Americans to remember.'

Obama participated in naturalization ceremonies at the White House in 2009, 2010, 2012 and last year.

Friday's ceremony will also recognize internationally known celebrity chef Jose Andres for outstanding achievements by a naturalized U.S. citizen. Andres, who is 44 and was born in Spain, became a citizen last November and also will mark his first July Fourth as a citizen.

Andres serves on the boards of the DC Central Kitchen and the L.A. Kitchen, in addition to international philanthropic work carried out through his World Central Kitchen.

Andres runs restaurants in California, Nevada, Florida, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C.

He has prepared meals for White House and other Obama administration events, and Obama and the first lady have gone out to dinner at some of his Andres' restaurants in Washington.

Andres also contributed financially to both of Obama's presidential campaigns.
