Conan O'Brien has become the first late night host to film an episode of his show in Cuba since the embargo of 1962.

O'Brien spent Presidents Day weekend in Havana, Cuba, filming an upcoming segment for an episode of his TBS talk show which will air next month. 

The network said the host is taking advantage of President Barack Obama's efforts to improve relations with the country.

According to TBS O'Brien spent 'multiple days taking in the sights, sounds and culture of the country to give his audience a rare glimpse into the daily life of a country not often seen by American viewers.'

His show on Cuba will air March 4 at 11 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. 

In December, President Obama proposed to effectively ease the trade embargo on the country which has been in place for decades. 

He announced that the U.S. would be moving to re-establish diplomatic relations with the island nation, including reopening an embassy in Havana and freeing travel restrictions.

Cubans can now apply for visas to travel to the Unites States, at the U.S. Interests Section building in Havana's Malecon in the district of Vedado, Plaza de la Revolucion.

The Cuban government has so far offered a guardedly positive reception to Obama's loosening of the trade embargo, saying it welcomes the full package of new economic ties on offer. 

Meanwhile, O'Brien reportedly picked the weekend before Presidents Day because his show does not tape on the holiday and he would have been available to travel, according to Deadline.com

However, it's not the first time that the show has stepped outside of the confines of the studio. It has filmed in Toronto, Chicago, Dallas and Ireland.

In January, it was announced that a production of 'Rent' will be performed  with the Cuban National Council of Performing Arts, according to CNN.

This will be the first full Broadway musical held in the country in 50 years.
