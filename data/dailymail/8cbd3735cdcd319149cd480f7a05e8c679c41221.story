Chancellor George Osborne has a special civil servant who guards his own padlocked fridge in the Treasury, it has been revealed.

Lib Dem Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander revealed Mr Osborne had his own full-length fridge, which he kept under lock and key to stop colleagues raiding his milk.

But sources have revealed there is also a Treasury insider known as ‘the Chancellor’s Messenger’ who has been given the job of guarding Mr Osborne’s fridge.

The fridge is protected by a small padlock, which has been specially drilled into the door.

Mr Osborne is understood to keep semi-skimmed milk and food in the 'double-length' fridge.

His Lib Dem colleague in the Treasury Mr Alexander told a gathering of reporters this afternoon: 'It is fair to say that we have got our differences – I get my burgers from Burger King. 

'We do share things – but not the milk which to my amusement he still keeps under lock and key.

'Yes really the fridge in the Treasury kitchen is replete with a padlock – it must have been tough in St Paul’s.'

The Chancellor is known to keep close watch on his diet after ballooning in weight after the 2010 election.

He was photographed last year wearing a computerised wristband that monitors exercise and sleeping patterns.

He regularly jogs in St James’s Park opposite the Treasury and follows the 5:2 followed by celebrities including Beyonce, Philip Schofield and Benedict Cumberbatch.

The diet means he has to fast twice a week. Labour’s shadow chancellor Ed Balls has previously been a devotee of the weight-loss plan.

Mr Osborne has lost 'a couple of stone' since going on the 5:2 diet as well as undergoing a make over

Mr Osborne ditched the diet after losing ‘a couple of stone’.

He revealed: 'I found myself putting on weight being stuck in here and the Treasury. I asked my doctor which diets he thought worked. He recommended the 5:2.

'I lost a couple of stone – and once you’re there, you just have to be careful. I just eat less and go running round the park.’

Mr Osborne also underwent a makeover by changing his hairstyle as a smart London hair salon.

He has insisted he was always prepared for unpopularity after taking charge of the nation’s dire finances in 2010.

The Chancellor was confronted with voters’ anger very publicly in 2012 when he was booed while handing out medals at the Paralympics in London.

He later hired Thea Rogers, a former producer for BBC political editor Nick Robinson, to manage his image.

She is credited with his repeated visits to building sites, inevitably wearing hi-vis, to portray a more business-minded politician outside the Westminster bubble.

But one of the most striking changes was unveiled at the Tory party conference in 2013, when his long, unruly style was replaced with the sharp, cropped look.

At the time, Mr Osborne admitted that the new look was in part designed to disguise a bald spot.

He joked that Michael Gove had told him: ‘You have applied your economic policy to your hairstyle. You have turned it around to stop the recession.’

A spokesman for Mr Osborne said the allegation that he had his own fridge under lock and key was untrue. The source said: ‘There is only one fridge with a lock on. It's communal and it is next to Danny's office.'
