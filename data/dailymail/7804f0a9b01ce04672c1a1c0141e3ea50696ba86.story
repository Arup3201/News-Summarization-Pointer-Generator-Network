A space entrepreneur and billionaire has teased plans for a 'hyperloop' super train which he claims will enable people to make the 380-mile journey between Los Angeles and San Francisco in just 30 minutes - faster than it takes to fly.

Elon Musk claims his super train, which he describes as a cross between 'a Concorde, a rail gun, and an air-hockey table', will travel at speeds twice as fast as a plane and make the trip in half an hour.

He plans to reveal the full details, including how the train would work and the maximum running speed, next month but claims an engineer who tweeted a hypothetical drawing of the train and its tracks was the 'closest guess so far.'

Elon Musk will reveal his 'alpha design' for a 'hyperloop' super train next month. Many people have tried to guess how the proposed transport system might work but engineer John Gardi's explanation (pictured) has come the closest so far, according to the tech entrepreneur

An alternative theory, put forward by physicist Brian Dodson, suggests the hyperloop could be a pneumatic transport system consisting of a closed tube making loops between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The idea was inspired by plans proposed during the early 1900s, pictured

While some may think his ideas plain loopy, Musk has a track-record of thinking big.

He
 is the CEO of SpaceX, the first private company to send supplied to the
 International Space Station as well as founding PayPal and electronic 
car manufacturer Tesla Motors.

Musk said that he will publish an 'alpha design' for his ambitious transportation project on 12 August.

Musk teased the plans initially during the D11 Conference in California in May.

Many people have been trying to guess what Musk's hyperloop system might look like and how it might work.

It currently takes around 12 hours on the Coast Line train to make the journey between the two cities.

The journey can be done in around eight hours in a car and it takes just one and half hours to fly.

The top secret hyperloop train will take passengers along a route from Los Angeles to San Francisco, pictured, in a mere half hour.
In a tweet, the Tesla Motors co-founder behind the plans promised to publish the alpha design by 12 August

Engineer John Gardi tweeted his vision of how hyperloop could be realised and Musk responded to his drawing with a tweet that said: 'Your guess is the closest I've seen anyone guess so far'.

Musk has been teasing his high-speed transport network plans for around a year and has previously described it as 'a cross between a Concorde, a rail gun, and an air-hockey table'.

Another idea about how the super-train might work came from Gizmag physicist Brian Dodson.

Dodson ruled out two popular theories; that the train could involve a vacuum tunnel or could be accelerated along the track using an electromagnetic cable system.

Instead, Dodson believes that Musk is proposing a subsonic train.

He thinks the hyperloop will be a pneumatic transport system that 'consists of a closed tube making loops between Los Angeles and San Francisco and passengers would ride in capsules within the tube.'

The tech entrepreneur claims that his hyperloop super train could be three to four times faster than a ballet train like this one from the East Japan Railway. However he has plenty of problems to overcome from finding a business partner to obtaining land for this ambitious transport project

Elon Musk claims that his hyperloop super train will connect the Californian cities of Los Angeles (Venice Beach is pictured left) and San Francisco (right) with journey times of just 30 minutes

He first talked about the hyperloop in July 2012 in an interview with tech site PandoDaily.

He said that the system will never 
crash, is immune to weather, is three or four times faster than a 
conventional bullet train and travels twice as fast as the average speed
 of an aircraft.

He has also reportedly said that the 
ambitious system could be powered by solar energy and even generate more
 energy that it would use.

Musk believes the super fast service would have a build cost of around $6bn.

While this might sound like a lot, current plans for a bullet train service between L.A. and San Francisco with a time of around 3 hours is predicted to cost in the region of $68bn.

Responding to questions on Twitter, Musk said that his first design and possibly the technologies involved will be open source and that 'critical feedback for improvements would be much appreciated'.

Elon Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa before moving to Canada and later the U.S.

He taught himself how to program a computer and by the time he reached 12 year's old he had created and sold his first software program - a space game called Blastar - for around $500.

Musk started Zip2 - an online content publishing software - in 1998 with his brother, Kimbal Musk, which was bought in 1999 by Compaq's AltaVista division for a reported $300million.

Musk then co-found X.com - an online finance and email payment company - and a year later this firm merged with Confinity, which later became known as PayPal.

In October 2002, PayPal was bought by eBay for $1.5billion in stock and Musk, the company's largest shareholder, owned 11.7 per cent of these shares. 

In June 2002 Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX). SpaceX develops and manufactures space launch vehicles.

The company's first two launch vehicles were the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 rockets and its first spacecraft is Dragon.

SpaceX was awarded a billion-dollar NASA contract in December 2008, for 12 flights of their Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station, replacing the Space Shuttle after it retired in 2011.

Initially, Falcon 9/Dragon will replace the cargo transport function of the Shuttle and astronaut transport will be handled by the Soyuz.

Musk is also co-founder and head of product design at Tesla Motors. He was previously CEO of the company but due to reported layoffs in the company, he took a different position in 2008.

He is reported to have a 32 per cent stake in the car company, which is currently valued above $12 billion, as of 29 May 2013.

Additionally, Musk provided the initial concept for SolarCity, which was co-found with his cousin Lyndon Rive, and Musk is the company's largest shareholder and chairman of the board.

SolarCity is the largest provider of solar power systems in the U.S His cousin Lyndon Rive is the CEO and co-founder.

He said: 'I really hate patents unless critical to company survival. Will publish Hyperloop as open source.'

He also suggested that he could consider a partnership if he can find someone with the 'shared philosophical goal of breakthrough tech done fast & without wasting money on b******t' he tweeted.

There is much speculation about how the grand project could work.

According to The Register, the most likely scenario is a maglev train running in vacuum tubes.

This type of train is non-contact and electric-powered so is not slowed down by friction and could reach incredibly fast speeds using a relatively small amount of power.

The idea has been around for years but have never been really successful executed.

As well as relatively new technology, the hyperloop transport system faces additional challenges, including securing land in a picturesque and expensive location.

However, answering questions from the public about his latest venture, Mr Musk said that the super train will be safe to use in areas prone to earthquakes.

Previous theories of how hyperloop might work include a series of conveyor belts and even pneumatic tubes to push passengers along the line.
