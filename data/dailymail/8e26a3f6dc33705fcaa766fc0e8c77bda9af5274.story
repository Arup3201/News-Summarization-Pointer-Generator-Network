Former Governor of Virginia Bob McDonnell has told his and his wife's corruption trial that she was anxious about his election win.

Mr McDonnell and his wife were arguing just hours after his 2009 election victory - and he had to calm her down moments before taking a congratulatory phone call from President Obama.

The former Governor said that he sensed that his wife was worried about the pressure of living in the public spotlight as first lady the day after he won the vote, and they spoke of Maureen moving out of his mansion and seeking counseling.

Former Governor of Virginia Bob McDonnell and his wife Maureen are on trial for corruption after being 'showered with $165,000 in gifts and loans' by the CEO of a dietary supplements manufacturer

Taking to the stand for the first time, Mr McDonnell told the court in Richmond, Virginia: 'She seemed to be upset, concerned about her role.

'I could tell she was not as happy as I was about the result.'

The former governor said that the morning after his victory, his wife began yelling at him because he was focused on making and receiving calls. 

The court also heard that Mr McDonnell had to 'calm his wife down' after an argument moments before President Obama called to congratulate him on his victory. 

Other witnesses, including several former aides to Mrs McDonnell, have testified that she was miserable as first lady. She hated public speaking and the loss of privacy, and she was prone to angry outbursts. 

James Burke, a management consultant brought in because of what he called 'the undue amount of chaos' in the governor's mansion stemming from Maureen McDonnell's unhappiness and rage, said the possibility of her moving back into the couple's home in suburban Richmond was briefly discussed but nothing came of it.

Mr McDonnell added that he had reassured his wife that she would do a good job. 

Mr McDonnell, whose term ended in January, says there was nothing unusual about organizing a meeting between a top health official and Jonnie Williams - the CEO of Star Scientific supplements

Bob and Maureen McDonnell are on trial on charges that they took the gifts and loans from Jonnie Williams, the former CEO of dietary supplements maker Star Scientific Inc., in exchange for promoting his company's products. 

Mr McDonnell admitted yesterday that they did host a launch event for one of Mr Williams' products and organized a meeting between him and a top health official, but said this was not unusual - the Times Dispatch reported.

Mr McDonnell said the maker of tobacco-based anti-inflammatory Anatabloc only received basic help - no state funds or appointments.

'I — my administration — did very little but provide routine access to government,' he told the court.

Mr Williams, who testified for the prosecution under the condition of immunity, said he showered the McDonnells with gifts and loans to entice them to help him gain acceptance and state-backed research for his company.

Mr McDonnell said he did little more than provide 'routine access to government' when he hosted a launch meeting for one of Mr Williams' products

Among the favors prosecutors said the McDonnells provided were hosting a product launch event at the mansion and arranging a meeting with a top health official.

Mr McDonnell said there was nothing unusual about either, citing countless meetings he had arranged and at least two mansion events that were held for specific companies.

The former governor said   more than 300 events with 25,000 guests were hosted at his mansion during his four-year term, which ended in January.

He added that it was routine to add names to guest lists for events at the mansion or to attend an event where attendees gave checks to the administration, though he claimed to be aware that most people who handed over money hoped for 'something' in return.

He said: 'My rule of thumb is every contributor wants something. ... For many it's good government, clean government.' 

The trial continues.
