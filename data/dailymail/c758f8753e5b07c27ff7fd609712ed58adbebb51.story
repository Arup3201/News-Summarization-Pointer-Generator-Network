Residents in southwest Florida are reporting several recent UFO sightings.

A cell phone video taken by Cape Coral resident, Jeremy Rebstock, shows three orange lights in the night sky slowly moving from east to west. The video was taken on November 13 during a local festival.

Two more residents, Bob Buehler and his wife, were leaving the Coconut Festival when they noticed the same thing.

Other believers: Local residents, Bob Buehler and his wife, say they saw the same lights in the sky

‘Up in the air I would say 20 of them, a little group of three or four,’ Buehler told Fox4. ‘I think it was UFOs. I have no other explanation.’

Buehler says he is still shocked at what he saw and that he has never seen anything like it.

Another resident, Eric Sellers, took a similar video of lights in the sky, but says his video was taken the night after the Coconut Festival.

Sellers told Fox 4 that he is now a believer in UFOs.

Others are apparently becoming believers as well.

Reporters at the local Fox station say they have been ‘swamped with emails from folks saying they’ve seen UFOs in the area.’

For well over a year many unidentified flying objects have been seen flying in the Cape Coral skies, according to gather.com.

On the move: The white light hovers out of sight

A YouTube video from September shows a white light in the sky hovering over a local home in Cape Coral, near Santa Barbara.

Peter Davenport, the director of the National UFO Reporting Center in Washington state, told Fox4 that Cape Coral is not alone.

'The reports that came to the National UFO Reporting Center on Saturday night the 10th of November, they were remarkable,’ he said. ‘I don't think I fully understand the phenomenon that I am dealing with.’

Davenport said he compiled reports from across the United States all from that same night.

‘Clusters of red, orange, or yellow or amber fireballs,’ he said.
