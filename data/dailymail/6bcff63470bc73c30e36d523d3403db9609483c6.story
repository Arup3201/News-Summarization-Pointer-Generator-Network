Detectives investigating the disappearance of Tia Sharp have made two further arrests.

The Metropolitan Police has confirmed that Tia's grandmother, 46-year-old Christine Sharp, was arrested on suspicion of
 murder yesterday, she has been taken to a south London police station where she 
remains in custody.

Paul Meehan, a 39-year-old neighbour of Christine Sharp, was also arrested yesterday, on suspicion of 
assisting an offender. He also remains in custody in a south London police station.

Police were accused of incredible blunders last night after the body of Tia Sharp was found hidden at her grandmother’s home.

They even allowed ‘step-grandfather’ 
Stuart Hazell to go missing for several hours before he was arrested 
following a tip-off from a member of the public.

He
 was being detained last night on suspicion of murder. Neighbours were 
left questioning why it took more than 100 officers seven days to locate
 Tia, 12, when her body had been in the house all along.

And last night police refused to 
discuss where in the property the discovery was made even though they 
used ladders to access the loft.

Three searches had already been carried
 out and detectives are investigating whether the 12-year-old’s body was
 moved between the roof spaces of neighbouring properties.

Hazell was arrested by officers on Cannon Hill Common in Morden, South-West London, at 8.25pm.

Sources said he was the subject of a ‘controlled arrest’ after a member of the public had alerted them.

The arrest brought a relatively swift end to a manhunt into which the Met had poured vast resources.

Witnesses claimed Hazell appeared to be drunk and was calling out ‘Have you seen Tia?’ before he was held.

Chloe Bird, 11, said Hazell was in a mini market on Cannon Hill Lane, beside a hairdressers, buying a small bottle of vodka.

She said: 'He was crying and looked drunk. He just kept saying 'have you seen her - I want her back, I miss her so much'.'

Chloe
 recognised Hazell from the news. After the encounter at around 5.30pm 
she ran home and told her stepfather Nick Keeley, 40, who called the 
police.

Bryoni Goodwin said Hazell walked into the salon where she worked smelling of alcohol saying a little girl was lost.

The hairdresser described the suspect, who was wearing a baseball hat, a white vest and a red jacket, as ‘all over the place’.

She said Hazell entered the Sculpture 
hair salon on Cannon Hill Lane at around 5.30pm, a short distance from 
the park where he was later arrested.

After walking into the salon he entered a neighbouring shop in which he was seen on CCTV buying a bottle of vodka and a lighter.

‘He came into the salon and my boss dealt with him. He said “Have you seen Tia?’’,’ said Miss Goodwin, 18.

Tia has been missing 
since last Friday and police have found a corpse but will not 
confirm if it is her

‘He told us that he was her granddad 
and I did recognise him from the TV but at that stage I didn’t realise 
he was wanted. He said she was used to walking in the area as she went 
to school around here and that he was looking for her.

‘He had tears in his eyes the whole 
time but we thought that was normal. We told him we hadn’t seen her and 
then he walked out with tears in  his eyes.’

Staff in the salon realised Hazell was
 wanted in connection with the incident only after a customer checked 
the news on her phone.

The owner of the salon then phoned the police who, Miss Goodwin said, arrived five minutes later.

Neighbours expressed disbelief that 
the 37-year-old was able to disappear in the middle of Britain’s highest
 profile missing person inquiry.

There are fears that the week’s delay 
in discovering Tia could mean vital evidence inside her grandmother 
Christine’s home has been lost.

Dozens of people, including relatives,
 friends, media and police, entered the small terrace council home 
during the search for the missing girl. The tragic discovery of her body
 ended hopes that the schoolgirl could still be found alive one week 
after she disappeared from New Addington, near Croydon in South London.

Police were alerted to the possible 
presence of a body when sniffer dogs trained to detect decomposition 
returned to her grandmother’s home early yesterday.

A forensic team was sent in as a 
cordon was erected around the shabby property, followed by large 
screens. Officers will now undertake a painstaking examination of the 
house before removing the body for a post-mortem examination.

A pathologist will be asked to determine how and when Tia died and whether she was physically or sexually assaulted.

It is understood that the roof spaces 
of the row of 1960s properties are only partially separated by dividing 
brick walls. Senior officers launched a huge manhunt when they realised 
Hazell was unaccounted for.

The jobless painter and decorator was last seen on Thursday evening after he fiercely denied harming Tia.

Senior officers held a series of 
emergency meetings as dozens of angry neighbours gathered around the 
house when news of the discovery spread.

Residents, including many who joined searches of streets and woodland, warned of a potential riot over police mistakes.

Ginny Oteng, 46, said: ‘I was praying 
their little girl would be found alive and well. I had suspicions but it
 is still such a shock.’

A former senior police officer also 
expressed his shock at the way the inquiry, a murder investigation in 
everything but name, was conducted. Colin Sutton, who caught Milly 
Dowler’s killer Levi Bellfield, said he was ‘surprised’ at how long the 
police operation had taken.

‘The first rule of a missing child 
inquiry is to search the home. I am desperately sad for the family and 
desperately angry  the house wasn’t cleared earlier,’ he said.

Criminologist Professor David Wilson said he could not understand why the house was not treated as a crime scene from day one.

Former Met detective Kevin Hurley said
 he was concerned police were scared of ‘robustly’ investigating crimes 
and should be allowed to act on instinct without fear of repercussions. 
Police revealed they had searched Mrs Sharp’s home three times in the 
past seven days, including a detailed search of Tia’s bedroom.

Commander Neil Basu, of the 
Metropolitan Police, said last night he wanted to  ‘clarify some of the 
speculation’ over how police missed the body,  suggesting it had been 
moved.

Only the day before Tia’s body was found, Stuart Hazell gave a TV interview insisting he was innocent.

He broke down on Thursday afternoon as he complained people were ‘pointing fingers’ at him and claimed he ‘loved her to bits’.

He said: ‘Did I do anything to Tia? No, I bloody didn’t. I’d never think of it, I loved her to bits like she is my own daughter. She wanted it, she got it. She has got a loving home. I know deep down she walked down that path. What happened after that I don’t know.’

Hazell, who was interviewed by detectives as a witness for two hours on Wednesday, pleaded: ‘Tia come home babe, come home – come back and eat your dinner. I want things back to normal.’

Hazell gave what he claimed was a step-by-step account of his movements in the hours before Tia left.

He described how after meeting Tia in Croydon on Thursday afternoon they travelled home by tram and spent the evening playing computer games together, while Mrs Sharp was working overnight as a carer.

The following morning he claimed he made coffee and did some chores and told Tia to put her phone on charge which is why she did not have it on her when she went out.

'She was telling me what she was doing but I wasn’t really logging it into my head,’ he told ITV News. According to Hazell, he was vacuuming at 12.10pm when Tia said goodbye to him.

‘I said, “Make sure you’re back at six”, she went “yeah yeah yeah” and that was it and the door closed and she walks out.’

He said that Tia did not have a front door key or Oyster travel card and had instead gone into town using £10 he had given her for household chores and gardening.

Hazell, 37, added: ‘It’s not about me it’s about Tia – we have got to get her home.

‘She’s got no problems at all, she’s a happy go-lucky golden angel.

‘She’s perfect, there’s no arguments, nothing we can think of.’
