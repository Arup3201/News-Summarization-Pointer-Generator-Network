Liverpool lost in the region of £25m in the deal which saw Luis Suarez join Barcelona.

The sale of Suarez was always going to happen this summer as reported in this column FIRST.

But the predicted £100m fee that Liverpool wanted did not materialise.

Unmistakeable: Luis Suarez joined Barcelona with a trademark grin

Costly: Suarez's bite on Giorgio Chiellini hit Liverpool hard in the pocket

Everton and Tottenham still want Romelu Lukaku despite his poor World Cup showing.

But the Belgium striker is being pursued by Bundesliga outfit Wolfsburg.

That was because an auction between Barca and Real Madrid did not happen.

Madrid withdrew any interest after Suarez’s bite saga at the World Cup.

But Liverpool feel they have done well at £75 million, even though the Uruguayan’s confirmed buy-out clause was £100m. 

Wilfried Zaha is poised to leave Manchester United for Newcastle.

Manchester City wanted to sign Lionel Messi this summer.

City would have gone as far as paying Messi’s buy out clause from Barcelona of £200million.

With the addition of crowd funding with sponsors the deal had been a matter of negotiation for months with City’s hierarchy and several agents.

But Messi recently signed a new contract with Barca worth £16.3million a year.

Leader: Lionel Messi has dragged Argentina to the World Cup final with a string of fine displays

Happy to stay: Messi's new deal at Barcelona is worth over £16m a year

Lionel Messi is 9-2 to be first goalscorer in the World Cup final with Coral.

City could afford the money given their oil rich Arab owners and other partners.

But the Argentine, who is the central figure of the World Cup final, is satisfied with how he has been looked after by Barca.

Even given the massive amount Messi has been paid he showed a sense of loyalty.

City were willing to outbid Barca, but the impact of FIFA's Financial Fair Play regulations de-railed their bid.

Manchester United are still trying to lure Toni Kroos from Bayern Munich in a £40 million deal.

Liverpool and Tottenham are in a battle for Ivory Coast striker Wilfried Bony.

After signing Alexis Sanchez, Arsenal 
will try to lure German midfielder Sami Khedira in a £24m move as the 
Gunners seek to re-assert themselves as a Barclays Premier League title 
contender.

I-Say

No, I’ve never seen a game quite like it and I doubt I ever will again.

Germany 7 Brazil 1. In a World Cup semi-final. In Brazil. It was fantasy fussball from Germany.

Brazil expected fireworks in the favelas but in the end it became a funeral pyre.

In many ways, they got what they deserved.

Having abandoned their romantic roots of stylish samba soccer in favour of a mean, rough, win at all costs approach insisted upon by manager  Big Phil Scolari, they were simply outplayed by a group of superior players, in a superior system, who were never going to be out muscled.

Brazil, having sold their soul ended up in hell; Dante’s Inferno, indeed. The Brazilian player Dante, like all his team-mates, ended up being tortured before being condemned.

Germany passed them to death. It was, to turn a phrase on its head, just like watching Brazil but with added efficiency.

The football was sublime but ruthless too.

Yes the absence Neymar and Thiago Silva made a difference but in that respect it was a case of bonfire of vanities for Brazil.

The Neymar fixation, right down to Scolari wearing a cap bearing his name when they arrived at the stadium, and the players waving his shirt during the national, undermined them.

Even when Pele was in his pomp the team did not rely so heavily on him. There were plenty of others who could play Jogo Bonito like Rivelino, Tostao, Gerson and Jairzinho.

But having shelved the samba soccer Brazil didn’t have a clue what to do without Neymar in attack and without Silva had no spine or leadership.

David Luiz went from being King of the Copacabana to playing like Coco the Clown.

Fred and Hulk?  They wouldn’t even get into the England team and that’s saying something.

In the 1970 semi-final, West Germany lost a titanic battle 4-3 to Italy after extra time, in a match which became known of The Game of the Century.

Last Tuesday in Belo Horizonte we surely witnessed The Game of this Century.

But for the Germans to remember it with pride not just nostalgia then they have to crown it all in Rio on Sunday and win the World Cup.

Of course, Argentina won’t roll over like Brazil did. And there is a certain Lionel Messi to deal with.

But if Germany produce another performance close to that level then surely they will crack  Argentina so that the names of Bastian Schweinsteiger, Philipp Lahm, Toni Kroos , Thomas Muller  Miroslav Klose and  Manuel Neuer et al  will be up there with World Cup legends of any era.

And after such an entertaining World Cup, it would be fitting if the winners are the team who have consistently played the best and we are left to reflect that Germany delivered Fussball Uber Alles.

Back Heel

Most people’s abiding memories of the 1986 World Cup are Diego Maradona’s two goals against the England; the Hand of God in the 51st minute in the quarter-final then three minutes later the Greatest Goal as Argentina won 2-1.

Maradona then scored two more remarkable goals in the semi-final win over Belgium.

In the final Maradona did not notch. 
But after Germany had come from a two goal deficit and with Argentina on
 the ropes Maradona produced a sublime pass that was ‘half a goal’, as 
he released Jorge Burruchaga who raced clear to score the winner six 
minutes from time.

Brilliant: Maradona scores his second, sublime goal against England in the last-eight clash in 1986

Libero

It seems a long time since England shuffled out of the World  Cup after a woeful showing.

But the English game still has a massive allure given the global popularity of the Premier League.

It’s what attracts so much TV and sponsorship money.

And it’s good to see some companies putting something back too.

As part of their Vodafone Firsts project, the mobile network giant flew over an Under 15 team from Ghana, the Anokye Stars, to compete against four British teams in London last week. The action was streamed back to their village at a pop up cinema.

But clearly there is plenty of work to do at grass roots level in this country given the Ghanaians won the tournament with some ease.

Humble beginnings: The team from Ghana faced four English sides and won the tournament

BTW

It seems there are some West Ham fans who are getting hot under the collar about the change to their club badge.

The club have ditched the back drop of the Boleyn Castle, given they will move to the Olympic Stadium in a couple of years, and now have a simpler crest of two hammers, like the club had in the glory days of the Sixties.

They have also added the name London.

Both moves seem sensible to enhance the club’s brand without ditching the heritage. Exploiting the name London is especially shrewd.

Besides, over the years West Ham have had 15 badge designs, eight of which have not had the castle.

And to those stick in the muds, in the early 1900’s the club was advertised as West Ham London

Y-factor

Why do footballers keep lying ?

On the one hand Luis Suarez says he is ‘Leaving Liverpool with a heavy heart’.

But then he says that ‘playing in Spain is a lifelong dream.’

The truth is he couldn’t wait to get out of Liverpool this summer despite having led them to Champions League football so that he could fulfil an ambition and earn more money. So why not just admit it? Or bite his lip?
