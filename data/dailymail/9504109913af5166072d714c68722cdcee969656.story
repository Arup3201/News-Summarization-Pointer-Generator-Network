A woman who ballooned to size 38 has lost more than 20 stone after getting so fat she was forced to give up riding her beloved horse Rocky.

As a teenager Faith Riley, now 42, was a slim size 10 and loved riding horses, competing in eventing, cross-country and shows every weekend.

But her weight soared to 33 stone after an adverse reaction to contraceptive injections led to crippling depression and agoraphobia.

By the time she was in her thirties, Miss Riley had to give up horse riding altogether.

Faith Riley, 42, of Warrington, lost 20 stone after realising she was too heavy to ride her horse Rocky

Miss Riley's weight ballooned to 33st (left) after an adverse reaction to contraceptive injections led to depression and agoraphobia, but she managed to slim down to a size 14 (right) through exercising

As a teenager, Miss Riley was a slim size 10 who loved horse riding and competed in shows at weekends

She could no longer work in her job as a cleaner and a horse riding instructor, and hardly ever left the house.

After making a firm decision to lose weight, she turned to her horse Rocky to inspire the motivation to exercise. 

Mrs Riley, of Warrington, said: 'I cut out all the junk food from my diet and decided to get back out there again.'

Miss Riley was prescribed contraceptive injections when she was 23 after the pill caused her to experience extreme nausea and migraines.

She said: 'In my late teens I was a size 10 but the injection caused me to put on four stone in one month.

'I was horrified. The doctor, who suggested my weight gain was simply down to my diet, sent me to a nutritionist, but I knew I hadn't been eating lots of chocolate or junk food.

BEFORE 

Breakfast: Nothing

Lunch: Chips, peas, gravy and an energy drink

Dinner: Lasagne with garlic bread

Snacks: Crisps and chocolate 

 

AFTER

Breakfast: Bran flakes

Lunch: Ham salad sandwich

Dinner:  Grilled chicken and vegetables

Snacks: None 

'After a year of visiting the nutritionist the doctor agreed the injection had been a cause of my weight gain after all. 

'By then, I'd stopped taking the injection, but it was already too late.

'My weight had reached the point where I felt I couldn't do anything about it.

'I became extremely depressed and couldn't face leaving the house. 

'I had to give up work and couldn't even bare to see friends.'

Over the next decade Miss Riley, who was also diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis - a condition which causes painful periods and abdominal pain, when she was 26.

She saw her weight increase to the point where she had to stop riding.

She said: 'When I topped 30 stone I had to stop riding. Rocky would have been able to carry me because he was strong, but I was terrified that I would be too much of a burden to him.

'I thought it would have been cruel to ride him so although I was heartbroken I decided to stop riding.'

In 2006 Miss Riley attempted suicide. But after reaching her lowest point, following the breakdown of a relationship, she made a lasting decision. 

She said: 'I was 33 stone and wearing size 38 clothing.

'I spent some time on my own before I decided to get back to being me - the person I was before I became overweight and depressed.

'I knew it would be extremely difficult but I aimed to get back to the size 10 I once was.'

Sadly Miss Riley's horse Rocky, who inspired her weight loss, passed away, but she is determined to stay slim

Miss Riley turned to her faithful four-legged companion, Rocky, for the push she needed to make her lifestyle change happen.

She said: 'I knew Rocky would always love to go out with me. Although I couldn't ride him, I knew that spending time with him would always be useful to me.

'I put his bridle on and led him along the road for a walk every morning and every evening, without fail, for months.

'Sometimes motorists would pass and make horrible comments, but I didn't care because I knew I was trying my best and making a difference. 

Now Miss Riley is light enough to sit on a horse

'I was determined to shed the weight to get back to riding Rocky properly.

'I also completely changed my diet, getting rid of all the high-fat, high cholesterol food and replacing it with high-fibre and healthier options.'

Before beginning her weight loss regime, Miss Riley ate nothing for breakfast, followed by chips, peas and gravy with energy drinks for lunch.

Her evening meal was commonly lasagne with garlic bread and she snacked constantly on chocolates and packets of crisps.

As part of her healthy-eating regime, Miss Riley began the day with a bowl of bran flakes, followed by a ham salad sandwich for lunch.

Her transformed dinners include grilled chicken and vegetables and the 42-year-old has rid her diet of snacks.   

Today, Miss Riley weighs 12st 8lb and wears size 14 clothing.

She has been with her current partner, gardener Paul Bigg, 31, for two years.

She said: 'I met Paul when I was still a size 20, and I'm happy to say I've lost even more weight since then. I'm very confident in myself now.

'I know I'll never go back to the bad old days of being overweight and depressed.'

Although Rocky died while Miss Riley was on her weight loss journey, she is now looking forward to getting back in the saddle.

She said: 'I'm now light enough to sit on a horse and ride without any concerns. I'm currently recovering from knee surgery but as soon as I'm healed I'll be back out riding as regularly as I ever was.

'I have Rocky to thank my weight loss. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be where I am today, and goodness knows what state I'd be in. I owe him everything.'
