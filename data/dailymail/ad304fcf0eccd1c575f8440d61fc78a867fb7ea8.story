Millionaires are often used to getting what they want.

But it would appear that no matter how much they throw their wealth at estate agents in London, their millions aren't getting them much in these days of soaring house prices.

Estate agents are reporting that homes costing between £50million and £200million are extremely rare - despite people's willingness to part with huge sums of cash.

Homes for the super rich are few and far between, as the capital's house prices soar

David Adams, managing director of luxury estate agent John Taylor, said that the pool of mansions that both met clients' demands and were within their budget had considerably shrunk, the Guardian reported.

Investment firm London Central Portfolio claims there have only been nine properties sold for more than £20m in London this year.

However, these figures exclude those properties bought in the name of a company, a technique used by many overseas buyers, the Guardian reported.

As the London property market booms, the capital has been turned inside out over
the past decade because the highly-paid are now choosing the gritty 
inner-city over once-affluent leafy suburbs.

All change: This map from property experts show 
how areas of London have gone upmarket, in red, and downmarket, in blue,
in the past decade based on the earnings and professions who live there

A
map compiled by housing experts shows that the 21st century capital has
gone through 'reverse gentrification' at a dramatic pace.

Based
on the professions and salaries of those living there, the red areas 
show places that have gone 'upmarket' and communities that have gone 
'downmarket' since 2001.

Experts from estate agency 
Savills 
used socio-economic data from the Office for National Statistics and 
compared who lived where in 2001 and then in 2011, the latest data 
available.

It reveals the 
end of the trend where those who could not afford areas like Kensington,
Chelsea, Islington and other salubrious areas of Central London headed 
to the outer edges of the city.

The capital saw rises of almost 10 per cent in July, but prices fell in Scotland, Wales and the north of England.

London's house prices are now double those in many areas, and rising faster

The latest House Price Index showed values in England have now exceeded the peak in January 2008.

But it is almost entirely fuelled by a sharp rise in prices in London and the South East.

The Office for National Statistics said that UK house prices in July were 3.3 per cent higher than in 2012, up from a 3.1 per cent rise in June.

But when London and the South East are removed, prices are only up 0.8 per cent.

This surge in price has prompted fears

Last week, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) suggested that a 5 per cent cap should be placed on annual house price growth to stop any future house price bubble and borrowers taking on too much debt for fear of missing out on a boom.

'House price growth remains stable across most of the UK, although prices in London are increasing faster than the UK average,' the ONS said.

'The year-on-year increase reflected growth of 3.7 per cent in England and 1.8 per cent in Northern Ireland, offset by falls of 2 per cent in Scotland and 0.7 per cent in Wales.'
