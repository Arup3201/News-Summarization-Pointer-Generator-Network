 A 28-year-old Washington State resident fearfully filed two restraining orders against her allegedly abusive ex-boyfriend and now she is dead.

'A piece of paper isn’t going to save my life when he finally gets me, but at least you will know who killed me,' said Hargrove in a 2012 petition to King County Court for a restraining order against her allegedly abusive 28-year-old ex-boyfriend and the father of her third child, Michael Cushman.

The Seattle Times reports that friends of Amy Hargrove say that she moved to her mother's home out of fear for her safety.

Michael Cushman has been named 'a person of interest' by police but has not been charges

Michael Cushman, has been named a 'person of interest' in the murder.

Hargrove claims that he raped her at 
gunpoint and forced her to have sex with another person, raped her 
repeatedly when she was pregnant with their now 2-year-old son, stole 
her debit card and drained her account, and fractured her eye-socket.

She
 also claims that he once sped 120 miles per hour on a police speed 
chase and eventually flipped the car with the children in the back seat.

'He has cooperated with our detectives,' said a spokesperson for the Kirkland Police Department.

'They believe they're talking to the right person.'

Cushman has been interviewed but not arrested as detectives are still investigating the crime.

Police are also waiting for the Washington State Patrol Crime Lab to process evidence.

The Business Insider reports that Hargrove first sought protection from her boyfriend in 2012 over a child custody battle. Police did not say who the children are currently staying with in the wake of theri mother's death.

Hargrove once wrote in a statement for police, 'I just need my children safe. I want them to know how much I love them.' She feared Cushman would try to seek revenge on her.

The Seattle Times spoke to Cushman's 
former girlfriend. In 2009, he allegedly punched her in the face eight 
times, forced her into his house, and stole her cellphone.

When hearing about Hargrove's death she sobbed uncontrollably and said 'oh my god, oh my god' then denied talking any further.

Cushman was arrested in 2011 for a DUI and Reckless endangerment. Cushman also has an Assault 3 conviction for punching an ex-girlfriend in the face.

Amy Hargrove sensed that her husband would seek revenge and unfortunately she may have been right
