A British climber has scaled a 3,000ft rockface considered to be one of the most dangerous in the world - despite being blind.

Steve Bate, 35, has become the first registered blind person to conquer the El Capitan monolith in California.

The former climbing instructor spent six days hauling himself up the granite slab in Yosemite National Park and spent the nights sleeping in a hanging hammock.

Mr Bate was diagnosed two years ago with degenerative eye condition retinitis pigmentosa and is legally registered blind.

Climbing over all obstacles: Steve Bate, 35, from Elgin, Moray, was diagnosed with a degenerative illness called retinitis pigmentosa two years ago and is registered blind

Determined: Steve Bate, who was told he would be completely blind within five years of his diagnosis, wanted to complete the climb before losing his sight altogether Â 

He said: 'It was really tough and when I finished I couldn't really understand where all my strength had come from.

'It took a couple of days for me to recover from the exhaustion of it all, but I am so glad I did it. The feeling when I got to the top was just incredible and I am so happy with how it went.'

Mr Bate, from Moray, Scotland, lugged more than 100kg of equipment with him on his ascent and experienced a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the expedition.

At one point he almost threw in the towel after hearing a climber friend's girlfriend had been hit by a car.

He said: 'Spending so much time on my own, going through the motions over and over, had me making more mistakes than I would usually make because my guard was down.

Diagnosis: Steve Bate's condition, called retinitis pigmentosa, is incurable and is destroying his sight from the outside in, leaving him with severe tunnel vision

'I fell twice on the climb and it was so hot out there, I became tired a lot quicker than I had accounted for.'

Mr Bate's incurable eye disease is slowly destroying his sight from the outside inwards, a condition known as 'tunnel vision'. He has been told by specialists that he will be completely blind within three years.

'My eyesight hasn't been completely right for up to 10 years but I was only diagnosed two years ago,' he said. 'Now I have completely lost my peripheral vision, so it's like looking down a tunnel.

'I had to make a lot of changes to my lifestyle. For example, my driving licence got taken away and I couldn't go mountain biking anymore because it was too dangerous.

Not for the fainthearted: The entire climb took Steve Bate six days so he slept in a hanging hammock at night

'But climbing is something I really love, so I hope I never have to give it up. I'm certainly going to make the most of it, while I still can.

'When I was diagnosed two years ago, I was told that I could expect to be completely blind within five years, so I wanted to do the climb before it was too late.'

The bike charity project manager is the first blind person to conquer the granite monolith solo along the challenging 'Zodiac' route, in a bid to raise money for sight charity North East Sensory Services.

Mr Bate, who is married to Caroline, said: 'I'm not sure I will ever realise what I have done, being a climber it's just another great climb.

'I just hope it helps to inspire people, especially with disabilities, to believe that anything is possible if they set their minds to it. If I can do it, anyone can.'
