She laughed it off at the time and bravely carried on with the broadcast like a true professional.

But underneath it all, Fox NFL reporter Pam Oliver was in excruciating pain after she was hit in the face by a football thrown by Indianapolis quarterback Chandler Harnish during a pre-game link.

The Colts were in New York to take on the Giants on August 18 ahead of the new season and were warming up when Harnish threw the errant ball.

Oliver, a seasoned vet with more than 20
years broadcasting experience, was able to laugh off the unpleasant 
incident. Later she and Harnish were spotted hugging and making up.

After the incident: Pam Oliver's slight headache turned into a pounding one and the next day she woke up with so much pain in her head that she had to book an appointment with the doctor

She has now revealed that adrenaline got her through the rest of the broadcast, telling the New York Daily News: 'You don’t want to be wimpy, you just have to push through it.'

Afterwards, her slight headache turned into a pounding one, she revealed, and the next day she woke up with so much pain in her head that she had to hold it and booked an appointment with the doctor.

'I want to get it out there. It was a painful, shocking moment. I didn’t really know
what happened. The sensitivity to light started and some nausea too, my whole body was sore.'

Though the CT scan came up clean, she was diagnosed with a concussion and spent the next five days in a dark room in her home.

'I slept for hours on end. The minute you wake up you’re reminded. Your head is pounding,' she told the New York Daily News.

'I really could not take light — the light from the TV, the accent lighting. The sun was completely my enemy. My blinds were drawn. It was miserable.

'I worried about my memory, but after five days things began clearing up. I felt clear-headed and stronger, but the headaches still come and go.'

Concussion is a common injury in the 
NFL and Pam often has a birds eye view of the violence that takes place 
on the field every Sunday.

'Players don’t want to be reminded 
about their concussions. They don’t want to be known as the guy who went
down with one. They downplay it,' she said. 'Then it happens to me and I
start wondering how these guys go back to being hit, taking all that 
punishment, a week or two later.'

The broadcast journalist will return to the sidelines on September 8 when the Packers play the 49ers in San Francisco.

Amazingly considering his throw, Harnish earned a reputation for passing accuracy at Northern Illinois. 

He performed well enough to get selected in the 2012 NFL draft although as the last player chosen, he did earn the unfortunate title of 'Mr Irrelevant'.

Later Harnish also apologized for his wayward actions on Twitter and promised Oliver some flowers.

'Would like to take this time to apologize to Pam Oliver, for the bad pass to the face.. Be expecting flowers in the mail soon! #ToughLady

‘Would like to take this time to apologize to Pam Oliver, for the bad pass to the face.. Be expecting flowers in the mail soon! #ToughLady,’ he tweeted.

Mr Irrelevant: Harnish, left and number five, is unlikely to be giving his rival for the Colts' QB position any sleepless nights with his wayward throws
