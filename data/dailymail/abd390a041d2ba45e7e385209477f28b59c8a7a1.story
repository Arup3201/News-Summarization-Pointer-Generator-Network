Two teenagers charged with shooting dead a 13-month-old baby in his stroller appeared in court on Monday.

De'Marquise Elkins, 17, made his first court appearance in Brunswick, Georgia today, charged as an adult.

Elkins and a 14-year-old boy, who has not been identified, are both charged over last Thursday's shooting of baby Antonio Santiago and the wounding of his mother, Sherry West.

Murdered: Baby Antonio was shot in the head as he slept by two boys who attempted to rob his mother

Antonio died of a gunshot to the head 
after a botched robbery by two teenagers while West was out for a walk 
in the historic city.

'My client is absolutely, 1,000-percent not guilty,' public defender Kevin Gough, who represents Elkins said on Monday.Â 

Elkins is 
charged as an adult with first-degree murder, along with a 14-year-old 
who was not identified because he is a juvenile, Police Chief Tobe Green
said.

At Monday morning's hearing, the 14-year-old came into the courtroom shackled and wearing a baggy orange jumpsuit.

He glanced at the few members of the media allowed into the courtroom for the initial appearance as he shuffled to a lectern facing Glynn County Magistrate Tim Barton.

The magistrate told the boy he couldn't set a bond because only Superior Court judges can do so in murder cases.

'I'm going to see that you get a lawyer immediately,' Barton told the boy.

Horror: Demarquis Elkins, 17, allegedly threatened Sherry West then shot her infant son when she didn't give him any money

The 14-year-old was in the eighth grade at Glynn Middle School before his arrest, said Jim Weidhaas, a school spokesman.

Elkins was last a student in the 
system in October 2011 when he left Ombudsman, an outsourced alternative
school program, Weidhaas said.

The baby's mother said she was 
walking home on Thursday morning when two boys confronted her and one of
them opened fire. Police say she was shot in the leg, and her baby was 
shot in face.

Gough said he has demanded a bond hearing and filed a request for a speedy trial for Elkins.

'We look forward to our day in court,' he said.

Ms West recounted the attack this weekend. She said: 'He asked me for money and I said I didn't have it.

'When you have a baby, you spend all your money on babies. They're expensive. And he kept asking and I just said "I don't have it." And he said, "Do you want me to kill your baby?" And I said, "No, don't kill my baby!"'

Authorities said one of the teens fired four shots, grazing West's ear and striking her in the leg, before he walked around to the stroller and shot the baby in the face.

West said her son was walking well on his own and eight of his teeth had come in. But she also mourned the milestones that will never come, like Antonio's first day at school.

'I'm always going to wonder what his first word would be,' West said.

Luis Santiago, the boy's father, said he must take comfort in his faith that his in a better place.

'He's all right,' Santiago told the boy's mother, trying to smile. 'He's potty training upstairs in heaven.'

West said she took one look at a teenage suspect's jailhouse mugshot on Saturday and said he was definitely the killer. Yet an aunt of the teen said he was eating breakfast with her when the slaying took place.

Despite the conflicting stories, police have charged 17-year-old De'Marquise Elkins with murder, along with a 14-year-old suspect whose name has been withheld because he's a juvenile.

Brunswick police spokesman Todd Rhodes said even though Elkins' aunt provided an alibi, authorities have good reason to bring the charges.

'That's what she's saying, but the evidence we're looking at says something else,' Rhodes said, though he would not elaborate.

Also Saturday, police in the coastal 
port city released 911 recordings from neighbors who sobbed and pleaded 
for help right after 13-month-old Antonio Santiago was shot in the head a
few blocks from his mother's apartment.

Two teddy bears, a vase of flowers and a decorative cross had been left on Saturday against a wooden fence near the shooting scene.

Katrina Freeman said Saturday the 
shooter can't be her nephew, Elkins, because he showed up at her house 
on Thursday at 8.15am - roughly an hour before the killing. She said she
cooked eggs, grits and sausage for breakfast and that Elkins 
accompanied her and her children to run errands when they left at about 
11.30am.

'He was with us the whole time,' said 
Freeman, adding that she gave police the same account of her nephew's 
whereabouts. 'There is no doubt in my mind that he is innocent.'

The slain boy's mother said she picked
the gunman out of a photo lineup of 24 mugshots police brought to her on 
Friday. When a reporter showed her the photo of Elkins taken when he was
booked into the Glynn County jail Friday, she wept and nodded.

"He killed my baby, and he shot me, too," she said.

At her apartment on Saturday, West had 
filled several bags with her son's clothes and diapers to donate to 
charity. She said she hopes prosecutors pursue the death penalty in the 
case.

'My baby will never be back again,' West said, sobbing. 'He took an innocent life. I want his life, too.'

In 2008, West's 18-year-old son was 
stabbed to death in an altercation in New Jersey. Prosecutors said the 
stabbing was self-defense and did not file charges.

In Georgia, police said they are still searching for the gun. No eyewitnesses have come forward.

In the 911 recordings, two callers 
said they heard gunshots and then saw West take her son out of his 
stroller, lay him on the ground and try to revive him using CPR.

'Yes, I heard the shots. Somebody shot
this child,' said one sobbing caller, who told the operator there were 
three shots fired. 'She's got him on the ground. Please, we need 
everything we can get.'

The 911 operators asked the callers if
the boy was breathing. Finally, a man in a grave voice, answers: 'No, 
the baby's not breathing.'

He says the child was shot 'right between the
eyes'.

A woman can be heard screaming in the background just before police arrive. Sirens drowned out her cries.

Elkins' older sister, Sabrina Elkins, said
police arrested him as he came to her home on Friday.

'The police came pointing a Taser at 
him, telling him to get on the ground,' she said. 'He said, ''What are 
you getting me for? Can you tell me what I did?'''

The suspect's sister said he returned 
to Brunswick a couple of months ago after living in Atlanta for a while.
While he wasn't enrolled in high school, she said, he had been taking 
classes to earn his GED.

'He couldn't have done that to a little baby,' Sabrina Elkins said. 'My brother has a good heart.'
