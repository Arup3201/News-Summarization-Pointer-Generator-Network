Mollie King, who edited a fashion collection for Oasis, better watch her back because there's another Saturdays fashion designer hot on her heels.

Rochelle Humes has joined the ranks of celebrity designers at Very.co.uk to create her first-ever fashion collection - and the new mother looks incredible as she models every piece herself.

Drawing on her own sense of personal style and taking inspiration from the season’s latest trends, the 25-year-old has created a 19-piece capsule collection full of statement summery pieces.

Rochelle has created colourful lace dresses and jersey knits, which she hopes will be ideal for your Saturday night out while her printed summer dresses have been designed to take you easily from desk to dance floor.

Speaking about her debut fashion range, which ranges from sizes 8-20 and is priced between £25 -£59, The Saturdays singer said: 'Creating my first fashion line has been a dream come true.
