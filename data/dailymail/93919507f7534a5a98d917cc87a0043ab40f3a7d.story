Selfie king Lukas Podolski celebrated Germany's emphatic 7-1 win over World Cup hosts Brazil by taking a team snap on the plane back to their base.

It comes as no surprise that Podolski, who tweeted the picture of himself alongside seven team-mates on his official Twitter account, and the likes of Sami Khedira and Thomas Muller were beaming with pride after their impressive victory.

Goals from Muller, Miroslav Klose, Toni Kroos (2), Andre Schurrle (2) and Khedira helped the Germans book a spot in the World Cup final against either Argentina or Holland.

Joachim Low's side raced into a 5-0 lead after just 29 minutes (including four goals in six minutes) which left Brazilian fans, players and manager Luiz Felipe Scolari gobsmacked.

Germany, on the other hand, were able to celebrate their surprise win before preparing for Sunday's final in Rio.

Mesut Ozil, who played the full 90 minutes, also posted a celebratory picture on Twitter. The Arsenal star was snapped posing next to Julian Draxler in Germany's changing room.
