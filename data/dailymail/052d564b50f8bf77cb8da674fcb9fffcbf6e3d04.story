Juventus striker Carlos Tevez believes that playing in Italy has made him a more complete football player, claiming that the country is ‘the university of football’.

The Argentinian left Manchester City at the end of last season but has no regrets about the move to Serie A, claiming the Italian top flight is the hardest he has played in.

‘It's still the toughest league in the world. It's the university of football. Tactically, it's at the highest level here and we suffer on the field,’ the former West Ham and Manchester United striker told Gazzetta dello Sport.

‘Italy is completing me. If you can score goals here, you can anywhere.’

Juve are eight points clear at the top of Serie A and Tevez is determined to add another domestic title to his vast collection. The 29-year-old, who has netted 11 times this season for the Italian giants, is even eyeing a double with a Europa League win.  

‘I'm thinking about both competitions. I want them both,’ he added.

‘I won titles in Argentina, Brazil and England. Italy would be the fourth country. I dream of writing a page in the history of this club.

‘[The Europa League] is the only international competition I'm missing at club level.’

Despite
 Juventus having opened up a healthy gap at the top over second-placed 
Roma, Tevez, who won league titles at Boca Juniors, Corinthians, 
United and then City, is taking nothing for granted. 

‘Unfortunately,
 it's not finished. We have some of the toughest away matches: Napoli, 
Roma, Lazio, AC Milan and Udinese, for example,’ he said.

Another United old boy who is flourishing since swapping the Premier League for Serie A is Paul Pogba.

The fledgling midfielder has been outstanding in the Juve engine room this season and is almost certain to be a key part of France's World Cup squad in Brazil next summer.

Both players will be turning their attentions to Saturday's crunch clash with Sampdoria as Juve bid to increase their stranglehold on the Italian top flight further.
