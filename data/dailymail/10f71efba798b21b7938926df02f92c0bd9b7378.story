Prince Harry enjoyed a low-key night out with friends at a smart private members' club last night.

The 29-year-old Royal was seen leaving the Arts Club in London's Mayfair, where he reportedly hosted an intimate dinner for some of his closest friends, dressed in a smart black blazer, white shirt and jeans.

A source told Georgina Littlejohn of EntertainmentWise that the event was a 'private little get together' for friends, including England rugby star James Haskell.

Made In Chelsea star Mark Francis Vandelli and WAG Lizzie Cundy were also seen leaving the club on the same night.

Harry's girlfriend Cressida Bonas was absent from the event, with the source explaining: 'Cressida wasn't there but a lot of his rugby friends were as well as a few others, it was just a quiet little night.'

According to the entertainment site, Harry shunned champagne and caviar for simple grub, choosing chicken and chips washed down with white wine.

Prince Harry recently enjoyed a four-day skiing holiday with Cressida and friends - including 41-year-old Norweigian former stockbroker Inge Solheim - in Kazakhstan.

Mr Solheim, who met Prince Harry on a
 2011 expedition to the North Pole, flew with the couple and his wife, 
Anna, on the private jet of Turkish-born property developer Burak Oymen.

My
 Oymen, 40, who now lives in Monaco but has homes across the world, is 
understood to have sent his private plane to London to collect the four.

Across town, Harry's cousin Princess Beatrice was seen leaving trendy new Marylebone 
eatery, the Chiltern Firehouse.

Coleen Rooney and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

Delevingne there last week.
