Nina Pham, the first person to contract Ebola on U.S. soil, thanked the prayers she received from all over the world and a blood transfusion from Dr Kent Brantly - the American doctor who caught the disease in Liberia - as she was released from hospital on Friday, 12 days after being diagnosed with the virus.

After being released from the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, and fronting a press conference, the Dallas nurse was transported straight to the White House for a meeting with President Obama.

The President warmly greeted the health worker with a hug.  

'I feel fortunate and blessed to be standing here today,' the 26-year-old told reporters at the press conference.

'I would first and foremost like to thank God, my family, and friends.

'I would especially like to thank Dr Kent Brantly for his selfless act of donating plasma to me.

'I believe in the power of prayer, because I know so many people all over the world have been praying for me.'

Quarantined: Miss Pham's beloved dog, Bentley, has been placed on a 21-day incubation following his owners Ebola diagnosis. He is due to be released on November 1

'Although I no longer have Ebola, I know it may be a while before I have my strength back.'

Dr Anthony Fauci, the infectious disease chief at the NIH, was sure to reiterate at the press conference: ‘(Nina) is cured of Ebola.’

Miss Pham was one of two nurses in Dallas who became infected with Ebola while treating Thomas Eric Duncan, who died of the virus October 8.

She was diagnosed on October 12, but has since tested negative to five DNA exams

Amber Vinson, the second nurse to be diagnosed with Ebola, was cleared of the virus earlier this week, her family said.

Miss Pham received a blood transfusion from Dr Kent Brantly, who was given the all-clear from Ebola after controversially being flown into the U.S. from Liberia.

Those who have survived Ebola have antibodies in their blood which can help new sufferers beat the disease, doctors believe.

Pham was transferred to the biocontainment unit of the NIH facility last week from Texas Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas, where she contracted Ebola. 

White House press secretary Josh Earnest told The New York Times that Obama requested a meeting with Miss Pham when she heard she was about to be discharged.

Earnest told the newspaper that no extra precautions were taken by having Miss Pham inside the Oval Office because a 'clean bill of health' is precaution enough.

Earnest added that the President wanted to thank Miss Pham for caring for Thomas Eric Duncan.

Miss Pham was expected to leave for her home in Dallas following the White House visit. 

At the press conference today, Miss Pham said she was eager to be reunited with her dog, Bentley, who was quarantined following his owner's diagnosis.

Bentley will have see out a 21-day incubation, which is due to end November 1, before his properly reunited with Miss Pham.

She is expected to visit Bentley before his release. 

Tragic: Nina Pham, 26, was fighting for her life after contracting Ebola from Thomas Eric Duncan earlier this month. She has now been declared virus free and was released from hospital on Friday

Treatment: Nina Pham is seen here inside Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas on Thursday October 16, 2014, before being flown to the National Institutes of Health outside Washington

Despite wearing protective gear that included gowns, gloves, masks and face shields while caring for Mr Duncan, Miss Pham became the first person to contract the disease on U.S. soil.

Pham's parents live in Fort Worth, where they are part of a closely-knit, deeply-religious community of Vietnamese Catholics. 

Dr Brantly's blood donation is the third time the medic has helped an Ebola victim. He was found to have the same blood type as previous patient Dr Nick Sacra and NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, who is still being treated.

Ebola survivor Dr Kent Brantly 'selflessly' provided blood for a transfusion for Nina Pham

Incredibly, the nurse also matched with Dr Brantly and was given a transfusion of his blood in a move that doctors believe could save her life.  

Brantly is believed to have traveled to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where Pham worked, to make the donation. 

Dr Kent Brantly was flown back from Liberia to the U.S. after contracting Ebola during his missionary work for Samaritan's Purse.

He survived after receiving a dose of the experimental serum Z-Mapp and round-the-clock care at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. 

On September 10, Dr Brantly donated blood to a fellow doctor, Dr Rick Sacra, who also contracted Ebola during his work in West Africa and survived the disease. 

He also offered his blood to Thomas Eric Duncan but their blood types didn't match.  

Pham was diagnosed after admitting herself to hospital when her temperature spiked – one of the first symptoms of the deadly virus. 

On Friday the Texas Department of State Health Services acknowledged the release of Miss Pham, who was moved to Maryland to recieve better care.

On the mend: Miss Pham, seen here in a 2010 yearbook photo from Texas Christian University, will now return home to Dallas

'I’m happy that Nina Pham is now free of Ebola, and her health continues to improve,' the department's commissioner, Dr. David Lakey, said in a statement.

'Ms. Pham’s recovery is a testament to her perseverance in the face of the disease, the excellent care she has received and the support she had of so many here in Texas and across the nation.

'Ms. Pham is returning to Texas where she will continue to rest and regain her strength, but there is nothing medically that will prevent her from resuming a normal life.'

'Based on all of the clinical findings and lab tests, we are completely confident that she has cleared the virus and is of no risk to transmit the virus to others.'

Her release came on the day when New York was still reeling from the diagnosis of its first Ebola sufferer. 

Dr Craig Spencer, a Doctors without Borders volunteer, was diagnosed as carrying the virus on Thursday night after returning to the city from Guinea where he had been helping sufferers for a month. 

The doctor's fever spiked to 100.3 on Thursday which caused him to alert officials. He said he felt sluggish two days before but didn't necessarily think it was a sign of the illness. 

He enjoyed seven days in New York while carrying the disease and sparked terror across the affected areas. 

The 33-year-old went on a jog near his Harlem home, ate dinner at a restaurant and even went bowling. 

His fiancee is currently quarantined in New York's Belle Vue Hospital alongside him but is showing no signs of having caught the virus. Two friends the couple spent time with are also in self-isolation and are being monitored for signs of the disease.
