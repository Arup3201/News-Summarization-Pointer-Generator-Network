Kell Brook has vowed to prove he is a world class fighter by ripping the IBF welterweight crown from Shawn Porter when they clash at the StubHub Center in Carson, California on August 16.

Brook has had to bide his time for his first world title fight with three clashes against previous champion Devon Alexander cancelled through injuries to both men.

The unbeaten Sheffield star, who arrived at promoter Matchroom’s open day in a helicopter on Wednesday, will travel to America in two weeks’ time to complete his training camp, and Brook says that the time has come to show the world he belongs at the very top.

‘I’ve been through the mill the last 18 months but all that is forgotten now,’ said Brook. ‘We’ve got the date and after all the blood, sweat and tears it’s going to be worth it and I will prove to all the doubters that I am the real deal on the big stage when I win the World title on August 16.

‘We have been in training for a long time thinking it was going to be in July, then we thought it was August, then the beginning of September and now we’re back to August. I don’t know what is going on in their camp and really I don’t care, I don’t believe they want the fight, it’s risky for them with little reward. I am a 32-0 Brit and they would prefer to fight someone else but that’s why we worked hard to get the mandatory position so he has no option but to fight me.

‘The last few fights have been designed to keep me on track and focused but I have been ready for this world title shot for a long, long time. Funny things can happen in boxing but you have to stay professional, I’ve had a lot of advice from people who have been in my position, trying to secure a world title shot but getting frustrated, and that’s helped me a lot.

‘I didn’t want to fight for a vacant belt, I want to take it from the best. People have doubted that I am the real deal, people say I haven’t been tested and as soon as I step up I will get beat; I don’t want easy fights – I want the best out there. Shawn is the current champion and people are going to write me off, that’s why I am excited because I am going to go out there to put a show on and take Porter out and bring the belt home.’
