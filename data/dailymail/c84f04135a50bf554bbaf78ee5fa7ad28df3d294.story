A shameless prisoner has sparked outrage after smuggling a phone in to jail and posing for a selfie which he then uploaded on to Facebook.

Jack Carter took the picture with another inmate, who was also snapped staring down the camera in Wymott Prison in Lancashire. 

The 29-year-old then posted it on Facebook with the caption: 'selfie in my cellfie haha get on it.' 

A friend asked him to send him his number and asked if he had credit, referring to him as a #LEGEND.

Carter is currently serving time following a recall for prison, in which he breached the conditions of his licence. His original offence was for attempted grievous bodily harm.

A Prison Service spokesman said an investigation was ongoing and could not give a comment about the prisoner.

She said: 'We have made clear that it is totally unacceptable for prisoners to access social networking sites or instruct others to do so on their behalf.

'No prisoner should be in any doubt that if they break the rules they will be stripped of their privileges and may be reported to the police for further action.

'We have an agreement with Facebook to close down accounts being updated by or on behalf of serving prisoners.'

The prison holds 1,100 prisoners - use of a mobile behind bars is punishable with up to two more years inside

The selfie comes in the wake of new legislation proposed in Parliament to cut prisoners off from their mobile phones. 

Phone networks will be forced to block mobile phones and SIM cards if they are being used in prison as a suggested amendment to the Serious Crime Bill. 

It is hoped the new legislation will take advantage of cutting-edge detection equipment to allow prisons to identify unauthorised phones.   

Prison guards seize around 130 mobiles every week which are frequently used to run rackets inside from drug smuggling to contract killings or to harass their former victims or witnesses,

Use of a mobile behind bars is already punishable with a sentence of up to two more years in jail and an unlimited fine, but around 7,000 criminals still use them inside.

The most recent figures available show that a total of 7,451 illicit mobile phones were seized in prisons in England and Wales in 2013. 

Glyn Travis, from the Prison Officers' Association, told MailOnline: 'There's nothing unusual about this. It's another example of prisoners abusing the system.

'I think the Ministry of Justice have shown some form of action but it has not been done quick enough. It is too little too late. 

'The only thing they can do is to put blockers on mobile phones in prisons. 

'What the Ministry of Justice should do now is to fine the prisoner who has posted this selfie and give him an additional prison sentence to send a message out. 

'As far as I'm aware, that has never been used yet but they should now prosecute to show it is being taken seriously.'
