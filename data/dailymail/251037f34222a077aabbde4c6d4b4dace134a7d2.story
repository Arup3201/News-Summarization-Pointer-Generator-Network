Price promise: Ed Miliband said he would freeze gas and electricity bills in the UK

The boss of one of the biggest energy companies has said it would be too risky to cut prices ahead of winter because of Labour’s threatened price freeze.

Paul Massara, head of Npower, said the firm had not reduced fuel bills despite a slump in wholesale prices – as an election victory for Ed Miliband would see them forced to stick with the new tariffs for 20 months.

Critics last night said it showed Labour’s price freeze promise – which it heralded as the key part of its drive to help struggling families cope with increased living costs – had backfired spectacularly.

So far this year, wholesale gas prices, which make up nearly half of energy bills, have fallen by more than 50 per cent.

But in a letter to the energy regulator Ofgem, Mr Massara, whose company supplies 3.5million households, said Labour’s proposal had made it impossible to lower prices.

‘The potential Labour price freeze has, of course, also complicated  all pricing decisions further,’  he wrote.

‘The political and media pressures at the moment make it more difficult to reduce prices and then increase them again next spring.  Then we are acutely aware that if the Labour party were to implement their proposed price freeze, we will be living with the consequences of our standard tariff price for a very long time and beyond the level of risk that we could manage in the wholesale market.’

He added: ‘However, I can assure you that we review prices regularly and assess our options on a monthly basis.’ The correspondence, which was written in June but has only now been made public, came after Ofgem wrote to suppliers asking why price drops had not been passed on to customers.

Last September, Mr Miliband said he would freeze gas and electricity bills in the UK for 20 months if he wins the general election in May next year.

The commitment is credited with keeping his party high in the opinion polls, although new research claims it has wiped billions off the value of shares in energy firms. And Conservative politicians last night said that bills are likely to be artificially inflated all through next  winter because of the proposed price freeze.

Some City analysts had already warned that Labour’s policy would backfire, and the admission from the energy boss suggests they were right.

Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Dover and Deal, said: ‘Clearly Ed Miliband’s policy has backfired and is driving up energy bills today at a time when people can least afford it. Instead of making things easier, they are making them worse.

Paul Massara, head of Npower, said Miliband's promise had 'complicated 
all pricing decisions' for energy bills. Wholesale prices have dropped 
by 50 per cent but the company has not shifted its tariff (file picture)

‘Labour do not have an economic plan or credible policies. They are not fit to govern.’

Andrew Rosindell, Tory MP for Romford, added: ‘People have not had a reduction in energy bills and will not get one because of Labour before they are even in power. If Ed Miliband is elected it will lead to energy shortages. Labour’s energy price freeze is a false promise, and before they have even had a whiff of power it has backfired.’

Last night Labour defended its policy. Energy spokesman Caroline Flint said: ‘All the energy companies have 101 excuses about why they won’t cut their prices, but if Npower are publicly admitting that they are keeping their prices artificially high and the Government is doing nothing about it, that shows exactly why we need reform of the energy market.’

Mr Miliband has previously suggested that a Labour government could possibly seek control over other markets, fuelling speculation that Labour might step in to regulate water, rail and petrol.
