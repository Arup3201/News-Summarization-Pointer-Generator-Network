A mother of four described  as a ‘beautiful woman in chains’ has been found dead at the home where she cared for her disabled husband.

Alison Taylor’s wheelchair-bound spouse Ashley was arrested on suspicion of murder but was later released on bail.

A post-mortem examination failed to reveal how Mrs Taylor, 41, died and police are treating her death as unexplained.

'A beautiful woman in chains': Alison Taylor, 41, is pictured with her wheelchair-bound husband, Ashley, 42

After her body was found on Friday, a 
bunch of pink carnations was left outside the couple’s home with a note 
reading: ‘Alison RIP. A beautiful woman in chains XXX.’

Mr
 Taylor, 42, was released on Saturday evening, but did not return to the
 house as forensic officers continued their investigation yesterday.

Neighbours
 in the quiet cul-de-sac in Maidenhead, Berkshire, where the pair had 
lived for seven years said they were a reclusive couple who were both 
unemployed and had been together since they were teenagers.

Yesterday,
 an elderly neighbour who did not want to be named said they had fierce 
arguments that the whole street could hear and that they were widely 
claimed to be drug users.

She
 said: ‘They had lived here for a long time and Ashley seemed all right 
at first, but I think it was about a year ago that he started to use a 
wheelchair.

‘Alison cared for him full-time. She was a tiny woman, very thin and fragile looking.

‘They didn’t go out much and were very reclusive.’

The couple’s children – Courtney, 23, Oliver, 21, and 19-year-old  twins Paige and Paris – had all moved out.

Family: Mrs Taylor, pictured with her four children and husband, was found dead in her home in Maidenhead, Berkshire, at 8pm on Friday. Police arrested a man on suspicion of murder, but he has now been bailed

'Reclusive couple': Neighbours said Mr and Mrs Taylor lived only in the downstairs rooms of their £225,000 home (left), situated in a quiet cul-de-sac. Mr Taylor (right) has been unable to walk for the past three years

Another
 neighbour, Katie Allen, 36, said: ‘She was as sweet as  pie. She did 
everything for Ashley and she doted on her kids  and grandchildren.

‘When
 I spoke to her on Friday last week, she was looking forward to the 
birth of another grandchild. She seemed really happy and in good 
spirits.

‘I just can’t get my head around what has happened.’

A woman who lives nearby said: ‘There are always all sorts of people calling around there asking for money that they owe.

Police tape cordons off the scene: Police were called shortly after 8pm on Friday and found Mrs Taylor's body in the house. Neighbours described teams of forensic officers coming and going from the property until 3am

‘She
 would barely speak. When they came out of the house and I said “Hi 
Alison”, she would sort of mutter hello back and he would just stare at 
her. Something wasn’t right.’ She added: ‘I’m close with their kids, but
 haven’t had much to do with them. Their kids are lovely – I feel so sad
 for them. It’s tragic.

‘She did absolutely everything  for him. He couldn’t do anything for himself.

‘I
 know they were childhood sweethearts who had been together since they 
were 17, but they did have problems.’ It is understood that the couple, 
who married in September 1995, lived in the downstairs rooms of their 
£225,000, three-bedroom semi-detached house. A spokesman for Thames 
Valley Police said: ‘A post-mortem examination was carried out but 
proved inconclusive, so toxicology tests have been requested by the 
pathologist.

‘Formal identification of the woman is yet to take place.

‘A
 man was arrested on suspicion of murder. He has been released on police
 bail until May 15. Thames Valley Police is continuing to treat the 
death as unexplained at this stage of the investigation.’
