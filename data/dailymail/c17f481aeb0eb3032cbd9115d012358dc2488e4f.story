Alaskan serial killer Robert Hansen, who killed 17 women in the early 1970s and 80s. He died in prison last month aged 75 

The remains of an unidentified victim of an Alaskan serial killer who hunted down his victims as if they were game have been exhumed in a bid to establish who she was.

Robert Hansen confessed to killing 17 women in the 1970s and early 80s and after the murder 30 years ago, led authorities to her body near a lake in the north of Anchorage.

However, she was never identified and Hansen died last month aged 75, while serving a 461-year sentence in Alaska.

Now her body has been exhumed from from the cemetery at Anchorage Memorial Park with the hope that DNA testing and facial reconstruction will lead to her being identified.

The woman, who was believed to in her late teens was found on April 25, 1984, near Horseshoe Lake.

This led to her becoming known by many as 'Horseshoe Harriet' within the state's medical examiner's office.

The work is being paid for by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and a former forensic anthropologist for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is working for the center on the case.

Stephen Hoage, operations administrator for the state medical examiner's office said: 'We know what happened to her.

'We're not trying to solve the crime. We just want her to be identified.'

Mr Hoage said the woman was among cases of unidentified and missing people that were being reviewed by the center, with authorities receiving permission for the exhumation, the day before Hansen died.  

The date on her grave marker is April 24, 1984, one day off the date the body was found. 

But that's not the only discrepancy, another Hansen victim, DeLynn Frey, reportedly also was found near the same lake on the same day, but Mr Hoage said Frey was found near another lake in 1985.

Hansen was convicted in 1984 after confessing to killing 17 women, mostly dancers and prostitutes, during a 12-year span  in the 1970s and 80s. 

He was convicted of just four of the murders in a deal that spared him having to go to trial 17 times.

Hansen was the subject of a 2013 film titled, 'The Frozen Ground,' which starred Nicolas Cage as an Alaskan State Trooper investigating the slayings, with actor John Cusack portraying Hansen.

Hansen owned a bakery in a downtown mini mall and lived across town with his wife and children, who knew nothing of his double life.

He would abduct the women and take them to remote places outside the city, sometimes driving them and other times he would fly his private plane. 

The identity of one of his victims, who was found near Horseshoe lake north of Anchorage has never been established and now her remains are being exhumed 

Investigators have said that in some instances Hansen would rape the women but return them to Anchorage, warning them not to contact authorities.

Other times, he would let the women go free in the wilderness and then hunt them with his rifle.

In June 1983, one of his victims, Cindy Paulson, managed to escape his car as he loaded his plane to take her to his cabin.

He had already tortured and raped her, and she was still handcuffed when she ran from his car to flag down passing traffic.

She described the kidnapper and his plane to authorities, but when police questioned him, he had an alibi and a gentle demeanor, so they let him go.

But after some bodies were found by hunters in the area, investigators re-visited suspects and realized he fit the profile. His alibi - two friends - also admitted they had been lying.

They searched his plane, home and car and found he had some items, including jewelry, that had belonged to the women.

Only 12 bodies of the 17 women Hansen confessed to killing have been found. The others were never located.
