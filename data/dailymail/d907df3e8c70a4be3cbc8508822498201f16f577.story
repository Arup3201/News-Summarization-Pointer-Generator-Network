The uncertainty surrounding Mikel Arteta's future at Arsenal appears to have been lifted after the player's agent claimed he had signed a one-year contract extension at the Emirates.

The 32-year-old - who is currently sidelined with an ankle problem - arrived on a four-year deal in 2011, which was due to expire at the end of the season.

However, the Spaniard's agent Inaki Ibanez has told footmercato.net that his client will still be a Gunner next season.  'Mikel is no longer free next June, because he now has an extra year on his contract,' Ibanez said.

It has been reported that former club Everton were interested in convincing Arteta to return to Goodison Park.

Arteta has not played since limping off during Arsenal's 2-0 Champions League defeat of Borussia Dortmund in November and is not expected to return until April. 

The veteran playmaker was named club captain by Arsene Wenger following the departure of Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona, but has made only seven Premier League appearances this season.
