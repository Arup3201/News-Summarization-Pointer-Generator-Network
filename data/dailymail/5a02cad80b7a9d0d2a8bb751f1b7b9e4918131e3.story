De'Miyia Walker, four, was tragically killed while asleep in her room after a space heater caught on fire in her family's home in Alabama

A four-year-old girl was tragically killed in a house fire caused by a space heater.

De'Miyia Walker was asleep in her bedroom at the family's mobile home in Duncanville, Alabama when the heater in her room caught on fire last Saturday around 4am.

Her father, Demonia Clay, was unable to rescue her due to the thick smoke. 

State Fire Marshal Ed Paulk said the fire was caused by an electrical problem with the space heater, which led to the girl's death, according to WBRC.

Her mother had purchased it the day before - and in the early hours of January 31, it caught on fire while the family was inside the home.

The girl's sister and parents managed to escape.

Jacob Henderson, De'Miyia's great uncle, said the family was awakened by the oldest daughter, and their nephew tried to rescue the girl but the black smoke made it too difficult, according to ABC3340.

The child's great aunt, Juanita Tucker, said the family is hurting as they mourn De'Miyia's loss.

She said the young girl was everybody's joy and that she had just spoken to her on the phone the day before as she was leaving for work, according to Alabamas13.

Relatives were unable to find her due to smoke from the fire, and when firefighters arrived at the scene, they eventually found her body

The girl's family is mourning her loss after the horrific fire, said her great aunt Juanita Tucker (left). They are hoping others will be cautious when choosing methods to keep warm. Di'Miyia's great uncle Jacob Henderson (right) said everyone should take care how they heat their homes each year

Ms Tucker said: 'I told her I love her. She said "I love you too.'''

The family hopes the incident will be a warning to others when it comes to how they choose to warm their homes during the colder seasons.

Mr Henderson said: 'May everyone just be aware of what they're doing to heat their home each and every year.'

Marshal Paulk also said that there are safer options to staying warm at night which include wrapping up in quilts and covers, and not leaving space heaters running all night.

Funeral arrangements for Di'Miyia have been scheduled for Saturday. 

Services are at 1pm at Friendship Baptist Church in Duncanville.

More than 25,000 residential fires and more than 300 deaths are caused each year by space heaters, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. 

There are also more than 6,000 Americans who receive hospital emergency room care annually for burn injuries associated with room heaters. 

The Burn Center at Loyola University Medical Center said around 40 per cent of their burn cases are children with the majority being aged two and younger.

The center has offered tips for those who use space heaters:
