The former partner of a mother who was battered to death by her teenage son in a killing he copied from Coronation Street, has today blamed horror films and violent games for his violent behaviour.

Daniel Bartlam was just 14 when he hit mother Jacqueline Bartlam, 47, seven times with a claw hammer at their detached cul-de-sac home.

He
 then padded her body with paper, doused it in petrol and set fire to it
 in a bid to destroy evidence and commit the ‘perfect murder’. Mrs 
Bartlam had to be identified using dental records.

Bartlam, a former public schoolboy, who was jailed for life yesterday, had also been fascinated by violent video games rated 18 and DVDs, including Nightmare on Elm Street and the Evil Dead series, since the age of eight.

He watched the torture-themed film 
Saw just hours before murdering Jacqui at their home in Redhill, 
Nottingham, on Easter Sunday last year.

Today the 47-year-old's former 
partner, Simon Matters said: 'I was quite disturbed at the things he
 had in his bedroom - the Halloween movies, the Saw movies, the Evil 
Dead movies, Final Destination. They are all 18 and beyond, and some 
would probably scare adults, let alone children. But he seemed to thrive
 on it.

'It shocked me, and I said to Jacqui, "These are inappropriate for him". He was only 13 at the time.

'It must have had an impact because any normal thinking person wouldn't 
have done what he did unless he got something imprinted in his brain 
from what he watched,' he added.

Mr Matters of Hucknall, Notts, also believes measures need to be put in place to prevent 18 rated films and video games being sold to young people.

He added: 'The only thing I would like to see come out of all this is the fact that if the games and DVDs are a contributing factor, which I'm sure they are, then the people who sell them should be looking at themselves and saying, 'Next time I sell one, make sure the people buying them are of the age to buy them'.

Shocking: A scene from Coronation Street, with killer character John Stape on the right

Ablaze: After killing his mother, Daniel set fire to the modest family home in a bid to conceal her body

Bartlam was ordered to be detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure, with a 
recommendation he serve at least 16 years in custody before he is 
considered for release.

A court heard the teenager rescued his
 younger brother and the family pet before fleeing from the burning 
house, telling police that Mrs Bartlam, a Land Registry worker, had been
 killed by an intruder.

But Bartlam was charged with murder 
after police discovered video footage on his computer of Coronation 
Street’s killer character, John Stape.

Last night ITV was forced to defend 
the soap’s ‘pre-watershed’ storylines, which have become increasingly 
lurid in the past couple of years.

Influenced: Daniel Bartlam was obsessed with the Coronation Street killer John Snape, played by actor Graeme Hawley

Nottingham Crown Court heard Bartlam 
was ‘obsessed’ with Stape – who battered a woman with a hammer before 
leaving her body in the wreckage of a tram crash to cover up his crime –
 and stored files relating to the plot on his computer.

When police examined the rest of the 
hard drive they discovered he had searched for web pages about ‘people 
who get away with murder in shows’.

He posted violent scenes from television soap EastEnders on YouTube and had a fixation with crime drama Trial and Retribution.

He also penned a soap opera-style plot
 in which he fantasised about a character called Daniel Bartlam killing 
‘Jackie’, his mother.

A source close to the case told the 
Daily Mail: ‘He comes across as being very mature but there is a 
distinct lack of emotion. If he was an adult he could be considered a 
psychopath.’

The product of a broken home, Bartlam 
had been obsessed with horror films since the age of eight and watched 
the gruesome Saw 3D movie hours before the murder.

He was convicted of his mother’s 
murder in February following a two-week trial, but it was only after his
 sentencing yesterday that Mr Justice Flaux lifted reporting 
restrictions which prevented him from being named.

Sentencing Bartlam to life with a 
minimum of 16 years for the ‘senseless and grotesque killing’, the judge
 said the murder involved a high degree of planning, and Bartlam 
remained ‘extremely dangerous’.

During his trial, the jury were told 
he was a ‘young man who immersed himself in a fantasy world; fantasy 
words he wrote, television drama, films he accessed by the internet and 
other internet sites’.

Prosecutor Sean Smith added: ‘The boundaries between real life and fiction became very, very tragically blurred.’

Bartlam, who is now 15, initially told police he had a good relationship with his mother.

On the night of the murder he claimed 
to have been confronted by a masked intruder at the property in Redhill,
 Nottingham, when he got up to use the toilet. He said the man threw a 
hammer at him before fleeing and that he then found his mother’s body on
 the floor of her burning bedroom. He said he panicked and fled with his
 brother and their dog.

Bartlam was charged two days after the
 killing. In an outburst at the secure unit he was remanded to soon 
after, he threatened to ‘kill’ a fellow patient, ‘like I killed my mum’.

He denied murder, offering to admit 
manslaughter on the basis that he snapped after being branded a ‘f******
 freak’ by his mother. Prosecutors refused to accept the plea and 
Bartlam will begin his sentence in a young offenders’ institution. 
Bartlam’s father Adrian, a successful businessman, separated from his 
mother in 2005, shortly after the birth of their other child, a boy who 
is now six.

Until then, Bartlam had attended 
Greenholme, a Nottingham preparatory school which closed last year, and 
Dagfa, a private boys’ school.

But financial pressures meant that 
following his parents’ separation, Bartlam was sent to a Roman Catholic 
state school, where he failed to settle.

In 2010, he was referred to a school 
counsellor after telling pupils his tie, which he named ‘Fred’, was 
trying to hurt him. But just six weeks before the killing, mental health
 assessors concluded that Bartlam posed little or no risk to himself or 
others.

A Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust
 spokesman said: ‘Due to patient confidentiality we are unable to 
provide any further comment.’

Mrs Bartlam’s parents, who asked not 
to be named, said in a statement: ‘There are no winners here because not
 only have we lost Jacqui, but we have lost Daniel too.’

Coronation Street has been nicknamed 
‘the most violent place in Britain’, with ten characters killed off in 
the past two years. A tram disaster in December 2010 took the lives of 
four characters, while rapist Frank Foster was murdered last month.

An ITV spokesman said the channel took ‘careful steps to ensure that pre-watershed drama was appropriate for a family audience’.
