Owners of some of the world's most sought-after supercars braved torrential rain and mud to show off their vehicles at an annual invitation-only event.

A Porsche 918 Spyder, Ferrari LaFerrari and Bugatti Veyron Super Sport World Record Edition - one of only five in the world - were among the 200 high-performance cars on show at the 'Secret Supercar Meet', held at Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome and Proving Ground, Leicestershire, on Sunday.

The get-together, organised by supercar owners club Supercar Driver,  raised nearly £5,000 for Bluebell Wood Children's Hospital in Sheffield, which offers care and support to children with shortened life expectancy.

Super fleet: Painted in vibrant colours, 200 of the worlds most sought-after supercars and planes are seen on display at last weekend's event

Rare: A Jaguar Xj220S, one of only six road-going models of the car ever made, is driven through the Leicestershire countryside on Sunday

Elite: Three  hypercars, a CCX, a CCR and Agera from Swedish manufacturer Koenigsegg, which makes high-performance sports cars

Splash of colour: A BAC Mono driven by British Le Mans driver Oliver Webb, left, and a Bugatti Veron SS (right) were also seen at the meet

Bespoke: A rose gold Ferrari 458 - owned by car firm Yiannimize, which offers unusual and exclusive customisation options for VIP customers

Event organiser Adam Thorby, owner of Supercar Driver, said it was a testament to the group's members that the cars were on show despite the weather, which could potentially damage the vehicles.

He said: 'The turnout from members was staggering considering the forecast which was heavy rain all day. You would be lucky to see any one of those cars out in the height of summer, let alone the full group in less than ideal conditions.

'It is testament to our members who had committed to the event and have bought their cars to use them, whatever the weather.'

The fleet of vehicles, which boast a combined worth more than £20million, also included a Mercedes AMG 300SL that was custom made for the Sultan of Brunei.

Other cars on display included a  blue Pagani Zonda S Roadster, a Ford GT 720 Mirage - one of just three such cars in the world- and a rare 70s Ferrari Daytona, and a BAC Mono driven by Le Mans Champion Oliver Webb.

Mr Thorby added: 'The photoshoot on the runway was evidence of typical British weather, however it didn't put off these brave souls who were patient while we arranged the cars and jets.

'We are delighted with how the event has been received and I'm already underway planning the 2016 event - watch this space.'
