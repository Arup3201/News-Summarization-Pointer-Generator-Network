An over-enthusiastic fan has put Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte out of action after she leapt at him.

The five-time Olympic champion tore a ligament and sprained another in his left knee last weekend during a visit to Gainesville, Florida.

An unidentified teenage girl ran at Lochte, who tried to catch her, but the two fell over in the process, his publicist said. Lochte hit his knee on a curb, while the girl was not hurt.

Competing: Lochte is next due to compete in the Duel in the Pool meet in Scotland

Publicist Janice Lee says in a statement issued yesterday that Lochte's medical team expects him 'to make a full and speedy recovery'.

Lochte tweeted that he was headed to Gainesville last weekend. He trained there for several years after competing for the University of Florida. He has moved his training to Charlotte, North Carolina.

Lochte is next scheduled to represent the US in the Duel in the Pool meet in Scotland on December 20 to 21.

29-year-old Lochte has 11 Olympic medals - five gold, three silver and three bronze.

Born in New York, he started swimming at five-years-old and was coached by his swimming teacher father.Â  He qualified for his first Olympic Games in 2004.
