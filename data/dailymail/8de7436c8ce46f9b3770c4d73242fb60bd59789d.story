Michelle Obama spent Sunday night watching her niece play basketball for Princeton.

The first lady attended her alma mater's game against American University with her daughters and mother. Mrs Obama graduated from Princeton in 1985. She spoke with the Tigers at the half, knocking on the locker room door and asking, 'if she was interrupting anything,' Princeton coach Courtney Banghart said.

The first lady spent halftime talking to the team, taking pictures and saying how proud she was of how hard they played. The first lady and her daughters also took part in the cheer before the team went out for the second half.

'It was very cool,' Banghart told The Associated Press in a phone interview Sunday night. 'It was pretty surreal. She carries herself with such charisma and grace, she's a beautiful woman and she's a Princeton alum.'

The first family stayed for the entire game, sitting directly behind the Tigers bench. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, who played at Harvard, also was at the game. Banghart said the game was scheduled so that the Obamas could have a chance to watch their niece Leslie Robinson play.

The freshman was scoreless in 11 minutes, but had five rebounds in Princeton's 63-56 win.

'She's the nicest kid, but you could tell she was a little anxious before the game,' Banghart said.

The Tigers had a private tour of the White House on Saturday, getting to play on the basketball court there.

'It really was a special weekend and one that my players won't forget anytime soon,' the coach said.
