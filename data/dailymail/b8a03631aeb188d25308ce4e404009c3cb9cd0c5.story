Students at Southern Methodist University in Dallas have described Professor Rick Halperin as brilliant and passionate about the cause of human rights, but according to a lawsuit filed by his former assistant, the respectable educator is a lecher obsessed with Nazis.

Patricia Davis, the former associate director of Embrey Human Rights Program, sued SMU Tuesday, claiming that Halperin 'had inappropriate conduct towards women in his classes, including undergraduate and graduate students.'

In her lawsuit, Davis accused SMU officials, including school president R. Gerald Turner, of failing to properly investigate her concerns regarding Halperin, who heads the Embrey program.

Explosive allegations: Patricia Davis (left), former associate director of Embrey Human Rights Program, field a complaint accusing SMU of firing her for claiming that her boss, Rick Halperin (right) was harassing female students and had an obsession with Nazis

Bizarre claims: Davis said in her petition that Halperin, pictured here in his office in September 2008, is a Nazi fetishist who surrounds himself with posters displaying symbols of the Third Reich

The complaint cited by the Dallas Morning News states that Beth Wilson, the university's Title IX coordinator, told Davis she had 'found no evidence' of improper conduct on Halperin's part after looking into the allegations, but would not elaborate what led to that conclusion.

Davis was fired from SMU a day after she had requested to appeal the decision. The termination letter stated that she was being let go 'due to false accusations of sexual harassment and to your disruptive and detrimental impact on Program operations and your poor working relationships with Program and other SMU staff.' 

In her federal wrongful termination petition, the formerly tenured theology professor says that Embrey staffers 'noticed that Halperin often had women in his office behind closed doors and at odd hours.'

She goes on to claim that officials with the EHRP put a policy in place under which Halperin was not to be left alone with anyone in the program's suite after business hours, on weekends, or over holidays, 'and never behind closed doors.' However, the lawsuit alleges that the head of EHRP flouted the rule.

In an odd twist, Davis also has accused her former superior of being obsessed with Nazis, privately giving the 'Heil Hitler' salute, displaying Nazi symbols in his office and 'watching hours and hours of pictures of bodies and Holocaust death camps on his office television.'

Respected academic: According to his biography on SMU's website, Halperin joined the college in 1985 as an academic advisor and history teacher, and began teaching human rights courses in 1990

The lawsuit further states that when Davis warned her boss about his questionable conduct after hearing complaints from students and staff, Halperin 'attacked her integrity' and allegedly threatened to have her fired should she blow the whistle on him. 

According to his biography on SMU's website, Halperin joined the Dallas college in 1985 as an academic adviser and history teacher, and began teaching human rights courses in 1990.

For the past several years, Halperin has been leading groups of students and faculty on annual 10-day trips to Holocaust death camps in Poland 'in order to learn about and pay tribute to the men, women and children destroyed in the camps, and to honor those who survived the experience,' his SMU page states.

Halperin, a George Washington University- and Sorbonne-educated professor, is highly regarded in the human rights community, taking part in UN monitoring delegations that inspected prison conditions in Ireland and El Salvador, and visiting Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza.

SMU's campus newspaper The Daily Mustang reported in 2008 that Halperin served as chair of the Board of Directors of Amnesty International USA from 1992-1993 and then again from 2005-2007.

For his humanitarian work, Halperin received the Amnesty International Frederick Douglass Abolitionist Award, among other honors.

In 2005, SMU received an endowment from Lauren Embrey, the president and CEO of the philanthropic Embrey Family Foundation, to create the Embrey Human Rights Program, with Halperin at the helm.

Bad behavior: Davis (left) claims that Halperin, highly regarded for his humanitarian work with the UN inspecting prisons, watched hours of Holocaust photos, yelled 'Achtung' on the phone and seduced female students

That same year, Davis said she first suspected her chief of engaging in inappropriate relations with his students while on a trip to Poland, Dallas Observer reported.

Eight months later, Davis said in her petition that she walked into Halperin's office to find a female undergraduate 'kneeling behind Halperin's desk with him.' Seeing David, the student 'jumped up with a start. Both acted embarrassed ass if in a compromising situation, and [the student] ran out of the office.'

In another incident that happened one evening in 2011, Davis said in her complaint that she walked in on a similar scene in the EHRP suite, with Halperin and a young woman who was with him looking embarrassed and stammering forced greetings.'

Davis claims that even before the alleged encounters, her former boss had displayed odd behavior, admitting to her that he enjoyed running around his neighborhood naked and looking into strangers'  windows for fun - a hobby he referred to as 'steam-piping.'

Also, the professor who has been touring Holocaust sites appeared to be a Nazi fetishist, yelling 'Achtung' on the phone and displaying huge posters of Nazi symbols in his office, the petition states.

When asked to comment on the allegations, Halperin said that he has not seen the lawsuit, while SMU has declined to address Davis' claims.

Meanwhile, Halperin's students created a Facebook group called 'We love Rick Halperin' in support of the beleaguered professor, calling him 'kind-hearted, understanding' and 'wise.'

As of Wednesday evening, 270 people have joined the group in support of Halperin, with members calling accusations against him 'defamatory' and 'erroneous.'
