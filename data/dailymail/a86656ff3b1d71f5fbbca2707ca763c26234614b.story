Right size: Laura Harold 33, was chosen to stand in for Saoirse Ronan, 19, because they have almost identical figures

For any woman, being told you look half your age is as good as it can get.

But it's just in a day's work for Laura Harold of South Wales, who was cast to stand in for a 19-year-old Hollywood beauty.

Harold appears in How I Live Now, in place of screen siren Saoirse Ronan.

Miss Harold was picked by the film's casting agent to appear in stunts and a naked dream scene, such is her likeness to the teenage actress.

She beat other younger candidates to film the low-budget adaption of Meg Rosoff's novel.

Saoirse, star of Lovely Bones and Atonement, spent time with Laura on set so she could master the actresses walk and mannerisms.

Miss Harold said: 'It was lucky that I fit the measurements needed to play Saoirse's character. In fact my waist is a little smaller.

'Friends say how lucky I am to play a 19-year-old at my age. I am naturally petite but it is a massive compliment to fill in for a Hollywood actress. I keep myself fit but don't have any special diet.

'I have always picked up interesting projects - I do a bit of singing and modelling but I'd never been a body double before.'

The movie, directed by Kevin 
MacDonald, tells the story of Daisy, a New Yorker, who comes to spend 
the summer with her eccentric cousins in an English country manor.

But her idyllic holiday is shattered when a Third World War breaks out. Miss Harold, who lives in the village of Dinas Powys, near Cardiff, said: 'Saoirse was so lovely.

Proud mum: Miss Harold has not let her acting get in the way of starting a family. She is pictured here with her partner Michael Taylor and their baby son Torin

'She is young and we messed about, of course, but when it was time to work she really got her head down.

'It was great fun to party with the cast and blow off some steam. I felt like one of the gang during my time filming.

'I had a chauffeur and was very well looked after. The project was low budget and we were tight for time so I came in as Saoirse's body double because she couldn't be in two places at once.'

The actress, a trim size eight, filmed in London and Wales last year - and has since had a baby son Torin, now 21 weeks.

But she has managed to get her trim figure back. Her nude scene is part of dream sequence in the movie - and Laura said the film crew were 'very kind and considerate' during the filming.

She said carpenter partner Michael Taylor, 40, wasn't jealous of her baring all for the film's audience.

She said: 'He's very supportive of everything I do and proud of me too. I come up with all sorts of wacky and creative ideas for work and he just says yes. He's brilliant with me.'

The couple are busy with their new baby - so they haven't had a chance to watch the film yet.

The actress said: 'We haven't made it to the cinema but I've seen my scene's already.

'I can tell when it's my body rather than Saoirse's but I'm keeping it to myself. I think everyone around here is a bit surprised what I do - but it was great.'Â
