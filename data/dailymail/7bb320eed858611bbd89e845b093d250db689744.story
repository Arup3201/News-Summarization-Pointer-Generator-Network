Samsung could be on the verge of entering the virtual reality race, if reports about an upcoming headset are true.

The Korean firm is said to have sent early prototypes to developers to test, and the final product could launch by the end of the year.

Sources close to Samsung told Engadget the headsets have OLED screens and will connect with the next generation of Galaxy devices.

In October, Samsung filed a design patent for wearable computer glasses that are tethered to a smartphone.

According to the files, Samsung's spectacles plug into a mobile phone and display information such as text messages and phone calls.

Unlike Google Glass, which is wireless, Samsung’s design will be attached using a micro-USB connection. This could potentially boost battery life.

The design also integrates ear phones into the frame, so users won’t need separate buds to listen to music.

The reports suggest the headset will run on Android, rather than the Tizen operating system most recently seen on Samsung’s latest smartwatches.

Engadget added the headset is also likely to connect to a phone or tablet using wires, to prevent a lag when playing games.

The release date, price and other features were not revealed, but it does differ from the rumoured Galaxy Glass project, first reported on in October.

Variations of virtual reality have been around for years, particularly in flight and driving simulators, but it's popularity has risen recently due to companies such as Oculus VR.

Its Oculus Rift headset began life as a Kickstarter project and was bought by Facebook earlier this year in a deal said to be worth around $2 billion. A consumer version is expected later this year.

Samsung was one of the first major companies to launch a smartwatch, after Sony, and is among the pioneers of the curved TV screen industry.

Sony announced its own headset, under Project Morpheus, in March.

The adjustable device features a head-mounted display with 1080p HD resolution and a 90-degree field of view, while sensors built into the headset track head movements.

In April, Microsoft bought smart glasses specialist Osterhout Design Group and rumours suggest its working on its own augmented and virtual reality gadget for players of the Xbox One.
