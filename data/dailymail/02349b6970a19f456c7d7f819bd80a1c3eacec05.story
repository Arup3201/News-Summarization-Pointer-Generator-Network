The £1million home of Peaches Geldof has remained untouched for nearly a year following her tragic death.

However, a pile of children's toys, a sofa, plastic furniture and a pram could be seen stacked outside the Kent property today - suggesting work is finally underway to sort the family's belongings.

Decorators could also be seen entering the property armed with paint brushes as neighbours claimed they believe it will now be cleaned out and sold on.

It comes ahead of the one-year anniversary of the mother-of-two's death, who was discovered in an upstairs bedroom in the property after overdosing on heroin.

A pile of children's toys, a sofa, plastic furniture, a pram and cardboard boxes could be seen stacked outside the  £1million home of Peaches Geldof in Kent  today - suggesting work is  underway to sort her belongings

The £1million country home has remained untouched for nearly a year following her tragic death in April last year. However, the items could be seen dumped in the driveway today as workers attempted to sort the home

Furniture, children's toys and boxes of belongings were piled outside the front door of the £1million home

Photographs of the home over the last 12 months have suggested it has lain untouched, with a pram discarded in the front driveway and children's toys littering the garden.

But today's developments suggest her family may now be clearing out the property and sorting through her and her family's belongings, which will no doubt harbour sentimental value.

A neighbour, who saw the workers arrive at the property this morning, said: 'Since she died, no one has been back.

'If you look at the place, it is very strange, it looks like time just stopped, everything is in exactly the same place from when she died.

'I was a bit shocked to see people going in there today, but it looks like they are doing some decorating inside.

'I would guess her partner will want to sell the house, it would be hard for anyone to go back after what happened there.

'The men inside were painting and cleaning, that's all I could see, but when I asked them about it and tried to find out if the property was going to be sold, they wouldn't tell me.

'But from where I was standing that's what it looked like.'

The home does not appear to be up for sale as of yet.

The movement at the property is believed to be the first since  the 25-year-old journalist and television presenter's death in April last year.

Until today, a pram and bin bags were the only items outside the country house where Peaches Geldof once lived. However, belongings from inside the country home were brought out and put on the driveway today

Peaches Geldof (pictured) took a fatal dose of high-purity heroin shortly before she was found dead on April 7 last year. At the time of the tragedy, Kent Police said the presenter's death was 'sudden' and 'unexplained'

Her widower, Tom Cohen, is said to have never returned to their marital home and is believed to be staying with their children Astala, two, and Phaedra, one, at his parents' home in south east London.

It was Mr Cohen who discovered his wife's body at the home they shared, after he returned from a weekend away on April 7.

An inquest in July heard that Peaches - daughter of late TV presenter Paula Yates and musician Sir Bob Geldof - had started using heroin again in February, after taking the substitute drug methadone for two-and-a-half years.

Coroner Roger Hatch said she took a fatal dose of high-purity heroin shortly before she was found dead. At the time of the tragedy Kent Police said the death was 'sudden' and 'unexplained'.

But her husband told the inquest he had seen Peaches flushing drugs she had hidden in the loft of their home down the toilet.

He found her body when he returned from a weekend away with the couple's two-year-old son, Astala. Their one-year-old son Phaedra was in the house with his mother.

Mr Hatch said the young mother had been trying to wean herself off drugs and had been clean months before her death but had relapsed.

Pixie Geldof (right) has said she will not be appearing at this year's Coachella Festival in California so that she can be in the UK for the anniversary of her beloved sister's death with her father, Sir Bob Geldof (left)

Today's movement comes as her father, Sir Bob Geldof, her sisters, Pixie, Fifi, and Tiger-Lily, husband Tom and her two young sons are set to reunite for the anniversary of her death next month.

Pixie Geldof has said she will not be appearing at this year's Coachella Festival in California so that she can be in the UK for quiet family day.

A source close to the model and singer was quoted this week as saying she had the choice to perform but turned it down, preferring to be with her family. 

Sir Bob is apparently keen to mark the anniversary by gathering the family together to exchange fond memories of Peaches.

He has previously revealed how he blames himself for his daughter's death, adding that he 'goes over and over and over' what he could have done to help her after she started using the drug again in the months leading up to her death.

He described the journalist, model and television presenter as 'super bright' but 'frantic'.
