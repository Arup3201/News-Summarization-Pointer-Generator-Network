Mikey Cousland had a stroke in 2012 and has since had a vagus nerve stimulator

Around 150,000 Britons a year suffer a stroke.

Mikey Cousland, 42, a taxi driver from West Lothian, Scotland, had one last year and underwent a new procedure to help him recover movement in his arm, as he tells CAROL DAVIS.

After driving my taxi around Edinburgh one Sunday in May 2012, I went to fitness training and then to my granddaughter Mya’s first birthday party. I fell into bed, exhausted. My next shift was due to start at 4am.

But when my wife Tracey woke at 5am, I was still asleep. She shook me to wake me up, but no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t get up - my right leg was numb. Nor could I move my right arm or hand, and I couldn’t speak. I’d try to move my mouth but couldn’t think of the words. It was terrifying.

I had tests at Forth Valley Royal Hospital in Larbert, including an MRI scan of my brain, and was told I’d had a stroke. I was shocked - I was fit with no risk factors such as a family history or smoking.

I spent three months in hospital, doing physiotherapy to learn to use my body again. But I was still left in a wheelchair and could barely speak above a whisper.

My right arm hung uselessly, supported by a sling. Luckily, I’m left-handed, so I could feed myself.Over three or four weeks, I learned to walk again using a stick, and had speech therapy and physiotherapy. But my right hand was next to useless - I could move my fingers but barely raise my hand. The physiotherapist said to keep trying to move it so my brain could learn new pathways.I still couldn’t form words, so I’d point to things to communicate with Tracey. She stopped work as a taxi driver to become my carer. She even had to dress me.

After my speech therapist told me about a trial of a new device that could help, I saw Dr Jesse Dawson at the Western Infirmary in Glasgow in July. He asked me to lift a tiny ball bearing and a marble to test my strength and dexterity, but I struggled and dropped them. Even lifting a baseball cap from the table was difficult.

Dr Dawson told me a nerve stimulator would be fitted around my vagus nerve, which runs from the brain to the abdomen. The stimulator (the size of a matchbox) would be implanted in my chest and linked to an electrode wrapped around the nerve in my neck.

It sends electrical signals to activate the nerve to prompt my brain to release more chemical messengers (neurotransmitters) that help make connections in the brain. The stimulator would be fired while doing my arm rehabilitation exercises and would hopefully retrain my brain to do the actions.

The one-hour operation took place in August under general anaesthetic and I left the next day with dressings on my neck and chest.

I had six weeks of physiotherapy, when doctors fired the stimulator using a remote control. At first, I struggled to reach a bottle on the table, but after a few weeks I could do it. It was like magic.

When the stimulator was on, I felt an odd tickle in my throat but it didn’t hurt. Week by week, I improved. Gradually, I could lift a baseball cap above my shoulder, and pass a newspaper from my damaged right hand to my left.

Doctors can’t say for sure if it is due to the stimulator, though.

Now I only use a stick on long walks, I can drink tea and dress myself again. It’s been a long haul, but I’ve been told I should keep improving - and by next year I hope to be driving again.

Dr Jesse Dawson is clinical senior lecturer in medicine at the University of Glasgow and consultant physician at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde.

Strokes occur when the brain is damaged by blood supply being interrupted by a blood clot or a ruptured artery. It can interfere with speech or memory and leave weakness in arms or legs.

Don't put off visiting your GP if you 
experience worrying symptoms.

Two in five UK residents admitted to doing
 this, according to a new survey from The Information Standard, and as a
 result, one in five had to be prescribed a stronger course of 
treatment.

When asked why they put off visiting their GP, half of 
respondents thought symptoms would clear up on their own and more than 
one in three didn’t want to waste their GP’s time.

Weakness down one side is common 
after a stroke and often the arm recovers poorly, because rehab usually 
focuses on getting patients walking, and complex functions in the hand 
need a lot of input from the brain.

Despite
 the damage, new connections between brain cells can form, probably 
mediated by neurotransmitters. Effectively it means the brain can rewire
 itself, so different parts do jobs usually done by the damaged part. 
Patients have extensive physiotherapy and rehabilitation to stimulate 
this. Many are left with permanent one-sided weakness.

Our trial aims to tackle arm weakness with a device to stimulate the left vagus nerve (the right one controls heart rate, so could cause it to drop if used).

Around 90,000 patients worldwide have had vagus nerve stimulation for conditions such as epilepsy and depression, but this is the first time it has been used  for stroke rehabilitation.

Stimulating the nerve can prompt production of more neuro-transmitters (the nerve is linked to important networks of brain cells). We are testing to see if doing this during physical therapy helps the brain re-wire more effectively.  This is designed for arm movement, but it has potential for other body parts affected by stroke.

In the trial, all the patients will have extensive physiotherapy, but half will also have the vagus nerve stimulator fitted.

The operation takes about an hour under general anaesthetic. First, we make a 5cm incision in the side of the neck above the vagus nerve. Moving blood vessels to one side, we wind the last 2cm of the electrode - a 15-30cm long thin wire - around the nerve.

We then make a 6cm incision on the left 
side of the chest, between the collarbone and the nipple. This is where 
we implant the 1cm thick matchbox-sized stimulator, which is stitched 
into place. We then plug in leads from the stimulator to the electrode 
(tunnelled under the skin) and close the incisions with stitches. Most 
patients go home the next morning.

When patients return for rehabilitation exercises two weeks later, we use a remote control linked to a laptop to fire the stimulator. It sends an impulse to the electrode wirelessly, which stimulates the nerve.

During two-hour rehab sessions, we fire the device repeatedly as the patient attempts to do tasks.The implant can remain in situ for life as it’s virtually risk-free, which means we can continue giving therapy if it’s beneficial.

So far, three patients we’ve finished treating with the stimulator responded well, while one didn’t have much response. This compares with two having a good response to just the rehabilitation (two had a poor response to that). When the trial finishes next summer we should see if the implant produces greater improvements.

There is a 1 to 3 per cent chance of damaging the vagus nerve, says Dr Dawson. As the nerve stimulates vocal cords, it can cause a hoarse voice. This is rare and usually temporary if it happens, although there is a very low chance this could be permanent.

There is a small risk of nerve damage, which could cause drooping eyelids and facial numbness.The risks are very low since this is a straightforward procedure, adds Dr Jeremy Rees, consultant neurologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, London, and Spire Bushey Hospital, Hertfordshire.

'Vagus nerve stimulation has been used for other conditions, so we know it’s safe. The main risk is it not working. All operations carry small risks of bleeding and infection.’

The operation costs the NHS about £10,000 and is available only through the trial. It is recruiting in Glasgow and Newcastle. Call  0141 211 2948 or email mvls-armweakness@glasgow.ac.uk
