Bonus: Stephen Hester, CEO of the Royal Bank of Scotland

David Cameron has stepped in to halve the bonus of the Royal Bank of Scotland chief-executive in a pay crackdown.

But Stephen Hester is still set to pocket a £750,000 payout today at the bank which is 83 per cent owned by the taxpayer.

Whitehall sources believe Mr Hester may 
see the maximum bonus he is entitled to of £1.5 million cut in half to 
£750,000 in order to show that the coalition is reining in executive 
pay.

Asked recently if the government will use
its shareholding to keep Mr Hester’s bonus under £1 million, the Prime 
Minister said: ‘The short answer is yes.’

Directors of RBS - which is 83 per cent owned by taxpayers - meet today amid calls last night from Bank of England Governor Sir Mervyn King for the City to ‘limit’ the annual bonus bonanza.

Government officials will send a 'strong message' to the committee that Mr Hester's pay must be cut.

But even a £750,000 payment is set to spark fury at the failure of ministers to strip the chief-executive of a bonus altogether in a year when RBS has seen its share price collapse by 40 per cent.

The fear is that the well regarded Mr Hester will quit RBS if he is refused a bonus - and ministers believe he is doing a good job.

Speaking in Brighton last night, Sir Mervyn said the bonus bonanza comes at a time when ordinary workers are suffering ‘a ferocious squeeze’ on their take-home pay. 

He said soaring inflation has led to ‘the longest period over which real wages have failed to rise since the 1920s’.

Sir Mervyn said: ‘The tragedy of the financial crisis is that those who have suffered most have been those who bear no responsibility for it.’

He added it would be wrong ‘if rewards
go disproportionately to a small elite, especially one which benefited 
from the support of taxpayers.’

There
is intense pressure for Mr Hester to show restraint in the size of 
bonus that he accepts, particularly after his rival at Lloyds, Antonio 
Horta-Osorio, recently refused a bonus.

Bonus cap: David Cameron has intervened to slash Mr Hester's bonus. Vince Cable, right, said the Government was in an 'uncomfortable position' as it attempted to limit executive payouts

In a refreshing break from tradition, the Portuguese-born boss said he did not want to be considered for a bonus, which could have been up to £2.4million.

He said the decision was triggered by ‘the tough financial circumstances that many people are facing’, as well as his recent two-month absence following a severe attack of insomnia.

But banking and government sources say Mr Hester is adamant he deserves his bonus for his role at the helm of the disgraced Scottish banking giant, which was kept afloat with £45billion of taxpayers’ money.

But Business Secretary Vince Cable last night admitted the government is in an ‘uncomfortable’ position as it tries to persuade RBS and Lloyds Banking Group to slash bonuses.

‘We’ve got this rather uncomfortable halfway house position between meddling and being hands-off,’ Mr Cable said yesterday. ‘There’s quite a lot of feedback into RBS over the government’s concern about bonus culture, where you’ve got a company that’s not just publicly owned but losing money, and I think that’s had an effect.’

At the RBS board meeting today, Mr Hester’s bonus will be discussed but a decision may, or may not, be made. Last year, the decision involved two meetings.

A petition, organised by Avaaz, the campaigning website, calling on the Government to stop RBS bonuses has attracted more than 90,000 signatures since it was launched on Saturday.

Alex Wilks, campaign director at Avaaz said: ‘The proposed fat cat bonuses are an absolute outrage. With taxpayers owning 83 per cent of RBS, the Government must act.’

A spokesman for Downing Street insisted the Prime Minister did not have the power to intervene directly to set the chief-executives pay.

In a boost for homeowners, Sir Mervyn said there is ‘scope for interest rates to remain low.’ The base rate has been held at 0.5 per cent since March 2009.
