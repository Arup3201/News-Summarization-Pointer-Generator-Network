A pensioner has been handed a £600 fine after she repeatedly ignored warnings to remove 15 festering bin bags from outside her home.

Rita Cadman was prosecuted by Stoke-on-Trent City Council’s environmental crime unit after neighbours complained the rotting rubbish, inclduing three full wheelie bins, was gradually piling up.

The 67-year-old was served with a warning telling her to clean up the driveway of her £110,000 semi-detached house in May last year.

But Cadman was taken to court after she failed to remove the bin bags within two months.

She was found guilty of failing to comply with the improvement notice issued by the council and fined £600 at North Staffordshire Justice Centre.

Cadman was also ordered to pay a further £263 costs and magistrates warned her the fine could  increase if garden is continually left untidy.

After the hearing, councillor Andy Platt, cabinet member for a clean city, said: 'This case shows how one resident can affect an entire neighbourhood by letting their property get into an appalling state.

'We can’t afford to let people pile rubbish up in their gardens which attract vermin and can lead to a rise in other problems, such as crime and anti-social behaviour.

'We gave the occupier numerous chances to sort this out, but nothing happened.

'We will continue to take whatever further action is necessary to ensure that she removes the rubbish from her property.

'We’ll
 always try to help people overcome problems like this before they get 
too serious, but if they won’t co-operate then we have to put the local 
community’s needs first.'

Neighbours also condemned Cadman, saying the rubbish attracted rats to the area.

Gwen Sutton, 76, said: 'I am aware of the house and as far as I know it’s been a problem for a while. It is a mess when I sometimes walk past it when I am on errands.

'I feel sorry for the neighbours who live closer to the property.

'We do have rats and vermin around here because of the nearby allotments but these rubbish piles just encourage more.'

But one neighbour Julian Hilditch, 43, defended Cadman, saying: 'I have had no problems at all with Rita.

'I know people have been complaining about the house and it is a bit of a mess, but I know of many worse houses.

'I don’t think any of it is food because there’s no smell. But Rita is great and always helps me out with my bins when I am away from my property.'

Cadman refused to comment as she left court.
