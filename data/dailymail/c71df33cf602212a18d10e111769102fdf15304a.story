A mother of nine who was shot a dozen times in her own hallway pleaded with her attacker: 'Do you think that's more than enough?' 

Catherine Delaney McCormack was shot at her home on June 13, 2008 in Clondalkin, south west Dublin. 

The 49-year-old victim answered a knock to her front door when the gunman attacked.

Speaking to RTE Radio, Ms McCormack said: 'I had shouted to them I was coming because they were waking the children. I opened the hall door. The person saw me. [Suddenly] I’m holding my stomach then and I’m on the ground.

‘I had funny sensations in my legs and I’m wondering like “what is this?” and then it dawned on me, “Oh my god, I’m being shot”.

‘I think I said something like “do you not think that’s more than enough?” and I shut the door. Then another two shots were fired through the door.’

Of the 14 bullets fired, 12 hit her in the legs, hip, back and stomach, piercing her bowel.

Ms McCormack said: ‘I was constantly turning and shouting to the children to get back because I was afraid that they’d be hurt.’

A priest administered the last rites after the shooting in Clondalkin, Dublin, but she was discharged from hospital two weeks later.

When she was interviewed by Irish police, they asked her whether she owed any money. 'I owe the ESB [an electricity supplier], i owe Eircom [a telephone service provider]. I have bills to pay. I didn't do anything illegal and I never have.' 

Nobody has been arrested an questioned in connection with Ms McCormack's shooting. 

On March 11, 2008, Ms McCormack was collecting a friend from Dublin Airport when an unidentified gunman fired four shots through her front door. 

Then on May 13, 2008, someone poured an inflammable liquid on her car and set it alight. 

Ms McCormack said she wanted Garda Commissioner Noirin O'Sullivan, pictured,  to help her with the case

One month later she was fighting for her life in Tallaght Hospital in Dublin. 

Ms McCormack said she informed detectives who she believes is behind the attacks. 

She earlier told  BBC Radio Five Live: 'I had all entry wounds and no exit wounds, which is a miracle in itself as I wouldn't be here now if they would have gone through.

'One of the detectives told me, that, normally if they are called out and somebody has been shot three times, they are being called out to a corpse.'

She added: 'Bad things do happen to good people. People are inclined to judge you by what happens to you and that you really deserved it. That really hurts.'

Ms McCormack said she has made a complaint to the Garda Ombudsman, to probe the investigation into her case by garda authorities.

She told the Sunday World: 'I cannot understand why this was all but swept under the carpet. I told them who I suspect was behind it but still they have got nowhere.

'I would like to see this being properly investigated for the sake of me and my children. I essentially lost some of my children as they remained with my husband.

'I am still afraid that someone was paid to kill me and they haven’t finished the job.

'I am calling on Commissioner Noirin O’Sullivan and anybody else who will listen to help me. Help me get some closure to this.'
