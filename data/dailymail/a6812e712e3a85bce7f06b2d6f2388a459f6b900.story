Ohio authorities say a man who jumped from a bridge while trying to avoid being struck by an oncoming tractor-trailer has died from injuries he suffered in the fall.

The Chillicothe Gazette reports Christopher Stiffler, a 34-year-old father-of-two from Jackson, jumped over a bridge wall on U.S. 35 in Chillicothe Tuesday morning following a series of crashes.

His mother, Erin, described him as a loving 'father, son, grandson, husband, friend and brother' in a heartfelt Facebook post.

She continued: 'Our lives will never be the same, something will always be missing, and we will all hold the short time we had with you dearly. Gone too soon and loved so much. RIP our dear sweet Chris.'

The Ohio State Highway Patrol says Stiffler had stopped his disabled car partially in the road around 6am Tuesday.

Two other vehicles swerved to avoid Stiffler's car, but struck his vehicle as well as each other's. 

As an oncoming tractor-trailer approached the disabled vehicles and lost control, Stiffer jumped over the bridge to avoid being hit.
