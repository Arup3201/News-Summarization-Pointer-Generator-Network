The wife of a wealthy Muslim has won a legal battle to divorce him after he claimed that Sharia law allowed him to take up to four wives and a temporary partner 28 years his junior.

Millionaire property developer Houshang Jafari, 62, refused to divorce wife Aghdas Bidaki, 53, despite taking up a ‘temporary wife’ 20 years her junior.

After standing by years of infidelity by Jafari, Ms Bidaki demanded a divorce when she discovered that her husband had fathered two children with his mistress.

The couple had moved to the UK 22 years ago with their three children but in 2010, Jafari moved out with his mistress Katrina into his luxurious £1.2million flat in Bristol's historic Dower House, while Ms Bidaki remained in the family home in Downleaze, Bristol.

Ms Bidaki launched an 18-month legal battle to end their marriage when Jafari refused to divorce her, claiming his actions were acceptable under Sharia law.

Jafari told the court that he was allowed to have four permanent marriages and as many ‘temporary’ marriages as he could afford - with the consent of his first wife - under the Iranian Civil Code.

Sharia Law is part of the Iranian Civil Code which states that a husband must get permission from his first wife before taking any more.

Demanded divorce: After years standing by Jafari's infidelity, Ms Bidaki demanded a divorce after learning that he had fathered two children with mistress Katrina (pictured together) who he had moved out of the family home with in 2010

He claimed Ms Bidaki had agreed that he could take multiple wives before their marriage, a claim she strenuously denies.

But a British judge granted the divorce on Friday at Bristol County Court, stating that his behaviour was ‘unreasonable’.

Recorder Jacklin, who will produce a full written judgement about the case next week, told the court: ‘I am quite sure that this is unreasonable behaviour and the marriage has irretrievably broken down.

‘I am quite satisfied of this.

‘I will pronounce a decree nisi now. The six weeks starts today.’

Jafari, represented in court by his mistress
Katrina, said Ms Bidaki had not complained until July 2011, despite 
knowing that he was in a relationship more than four years ago.

'Not love': Katrina, who represented Jafari in court, said that an Iranian marriage is based on the principle of polygamy and that it is 'not based on love'

Katrina,
the mother to Jafari’s two young sons, told the court: ‘Ms Bidaki 
married a man who was polygamous, that’s the end of it.

‘The whole of Islam is based on the principle of polygamy, whereas the Bible is based on the principle of monogamy.

‘The Iranian marriage is different in its constitution from the British marriage. It is not based on love.’

Jafari and Katrina, who uses the title ‘Lady Jafari,’ now plan to marry.

Jafari and Ms Bidaki will still remain married under the Sharia laws of Iran, as British court orders are not recognised.

Ms Bidaki has instructed lawyers there to apply to the courts to end the marriage.

Jafari and Ms Bidaki married in Iran in 1978 and the couple moved to the UK 22 years ago with their children Yaser, 33, Sajad, 26 and Yasaman, 28.

Speaking after the judgement was handed down on Friday, Ms Bidaki disputed his claims and said she would fight her former husband for anything she was entitled to in his property empire.

She said: ‘It is the beginning of the end. He claimed he didn’t love me from the start, which is rubbish.

‘Many women see their husband having an affair and they didn’t but I stayed until I realised he had two children. Then he disgusted me.

‘I stood by him while his money was piling up. I wasn’t expecting him to do it to me.’

Son Yaser added: ‘It has always been the case that my mum wanted to have a divorce after 32 years of marriage.

‘She wants to get on with her life. She sees herself as a UK resident and is instructing a lawyer in Iran to divorce him there.’
