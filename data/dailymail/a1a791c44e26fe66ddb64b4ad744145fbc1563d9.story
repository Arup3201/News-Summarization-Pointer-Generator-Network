Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said it would not be 'appropriate' to publish list of names

IRA suspects who were sent official letters telling them they were not wanted by the authorities cannot be named because of their ‘human rights’, a minister declared last night.

Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said she had seen the list of names but it would not be ‘appropriate’ or ‘helpful’ to publish it because it could breach their right to life and their right to privacy under the Human Rights Act.

In a statement to MPs, Miss Villiers said anyone who received a letter could still face prosecution and possession of one did not amount to a ‘get out of jail free card’. 

The existence of the letters, which were sent to nearly 200 IRA suspects after the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, only emerged last year after a failed prosecution.

Police arrested John Downey, 62, from Donegal as he passed through Gatwick Airport last year over the 1982 Hyde Park bombing in which four British soldiers were murdered.

But the case was thrown out by a senior judge after Mr Downey revealed the existence of a ‘comfort’ letter sent to him, by mistake, despite an outstanding warrant against him from the Metropolitan Police.

Miss Villiers made her statement in an effort to make clear the letters could not be relied upon.

She said: ‘No one should take any comfort from these letters, no one should rely on them.’

‘To all those who have a letter I say, if the police or prosecuting authorities have evidence which is available today or becomes available in the future to pursue you, they can and will pursue you.’

She said decisions by prosecutors and the police would not be influenced by the letters and a suspect could be prosecuted if there was enough evidence against them.

She also said publishing the list could undermine any future prosecution.

But her refusal to name those on the list of suspects enraged Unionist MPs on the Northern Ireland Committee, who asked what message it would send to victims of unsolved terror attacks. 

But Lady Sylvia Hermon MP, of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, criticised her decision, saying that not revealing the names gave little comfort to the victims of the IRA.

Democratic Unionist MP Ian Paisley demanded to know if there was a specific security threat against anyone on the list and suggested senior Sinn Fein leaders such as Gerry Adams could have been sent a letter.

John Downey, 62, was arrested last year over the 1982 Hyde Park bombing. The case was thrown out after he revealed the existence of a ‘comfort’ letter sent to him, by mistake, despite an outstanding warrant against him

In July, a judge-led review of the scheme found that it was systematically flawed in operation but not unlawful in principle.

The ‘on the runs’ scheme saw names of individuals passed to the Government, mostly through Sinn Fein.

Anyone found to not be wanted was given a letter of assurance.
