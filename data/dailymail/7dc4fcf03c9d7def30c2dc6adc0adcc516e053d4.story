Mother-of-four Tracey Askham, 47, was run over and crushed to death outside a supermarket after a fellow shopper had a violent coughing fit at the wheel of his car, an inquest heard today.

The teacher was packing her groceries into her Mini Cooper at Morrisons in the village of Idle, near Bradford, West Yorkshire, when she was struck by a runaway 4x4 Suzuki Vitara.

The car came to rest on top of her and she died of her injuries a week later in hospital.

Tragic: Schoolteacher Tracey Askham, 47, was packing her groceries into her Mini Cooper at Morrisons in Idle, near Bradford, West Yorkshire, when she was hit by a runaway 4x4 Suzuki Vitara

The investigation into Mrs Askham’s death showed that the Suzuki driver Frank Sellers, 70, who suffers from a number of lung problems had momentarily lost control of his vehicle after suffering a sudden coughing fit as he drove through the car park at 9mph.

His vehicle mounted a kerb before hitting Mrs Askham and her car – pushing the Mini back into the next parking space.

Mrs Askham had taught business studies at the 1,200 pupil Church of England Immanuel College secondary school in Thackley since 2001 and was described by pupils and staff and friends as ‘inspirational’ and ‘a ‘beautiful woman inside and out’.

After being freed Tracey Askham suffered a cardiac arrest on the way to Leeds General Infirmary. She went into a coma and died without regaining consciousness. Tests showed she died from bronco pneumonia

She was raising money to help build a school in Gambia and had also run a half marathon in memory of a former pupil who died of a heart ailment aged 21. She completed that challenge despite breaking both elbows during training.

The inquest in Bradford, West Yorkshire, heard the tragedy occurred at 7pm on August 21 last year when Mrs Askham, who had been visiting friends, stopped at Morrisons to buy tea for her boyfriend Iain and son Jack.

Eyewitness Steven Cunningham, a fork lift driver who was also shopping at the store, said: ‘I was walking back to the trolley park then I heard a bang and saw the four wheel drive car bouncing over the kerb area.

‘It just carried on travelling forward into the front of the Mini and I could see the lady standing there. When the four wheel drive hit the Mini, she just went down.

‘I ran over straightaway to see… the Mini still moving slightly and the four wheel drive was shoving the Mini back and the lady with it.

‘She was underneath the car and just her head stuck out the back. She was just calling for somebody to get the car off her. She was conscious at first.

‘I put my hands against the car to try and shove it and release some of the weight but there was nobody there to help. I ran back to where the trolley park was. I was like a headless chicken.

‘As I was at the back of the car the driver eventually appeared. I started saying ‘What have you done? You have run somebody over!’ There was nothing we could do.’

Mrs Askham was freed but suffered a cardiac arrest on the way to Leeds General Infirmary. She went into a coma and died without regaining consciousness. Tests showed she died from bronco pneumonia.

The hearing was told Mr Sellers who passed a breath test at the scene had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). His driving licence has been suspended since the crash.

Sgt Carl Quinn of West Yorkshire Police said: ‘Mr Sellers had got a cough but it had not caused him any significant issues.

‘He started coughing violently. The next thing he remembered is being parked with his vehicle in collision with the mini. He suggests he had a loss of consciousness which was regained at the time when the collision took place.

‘He had never had an incident or loss of consciousness before due to coughing. He lost consciousness and travelled in a straight line. Mr Sellers said he had a cough for about three weeks. He has a history of smoking and alcohol consumption.’

Giving evidence to the hearing Mr Sellers said he was on anti- depressants and an inhaler for his COPD. He said he had been driving for 41 years but had only been driving the Suzuki for nine days.He said: ‘I do not normally have this cough generally. I have never fainted in my entire life.’

Asked what did on day of accident he said: ‘On way back from the cash and carry I had dropped into the Royal Oak for a pint of Carling.’

He was asked by the coroner Roger Whittaker if he knew that he should not drink on anti-depressants: ‘I am aware you should probably not drink in excess on anti-depressants but I did not know it could not at all.’

Frank Sellers had a coughing fit and was unable to control his vehicle as it hit schoolteacher Tracey Askham in Morrisons car park in Idle, West Yorkshire

Mr Whittaker asked: ‘Do you think there was anything you could or should have done to avoid the incident?’

Mr Sellers answered: ‘No.’

Delivering a narrative verdict Mr Whittaker said: ‘I have to say it is difficult to visualise the scene of what has happened, the way in which a simple shopping expedition turned into such a tragedy.

‘I am satisfied that Frank Sellers did have a coughing fit that did cause him to blackout. I am satisfied from that evidence he could have done nothing about this situation from that point on.’

‘I do not believe a simple verdict of accidental death is appropriate for such an incident. I believe that this narrative verdict fulfils my obligation.’

His narrative verdict was: ‘Tracy Ashkam died from bronco pneumonia as a result of a crushing chest injury. She was in Morrisons car park putting her shopping in her Mini motorcar which was then struck by a Suzuki motor car. The driver of which had lost control over it as a result of an involuntary coughing fit. The verdict does not blame anyone.’
