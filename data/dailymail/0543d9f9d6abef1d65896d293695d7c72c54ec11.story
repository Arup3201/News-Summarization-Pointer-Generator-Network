A drink-drive case against a Swedish man of Asian origin collapsed at court after the defence lawyer pointed out that he’d ‘read on the internet that Asians process alcohol differently’.

The 63-year-old man was charged after a petrol station attendant in Karlskrona, southern Sweden, claimed to have seen him behaving in a drunk manner while filling his car up.

When police tracked him down and breathalysed him, he was found to have a blood-alcohol level of 1.64 per millilitre, eight times over the legal Swedish limit of 0.2 millilitre.

He was charged despite the man’s friends telling police that he’d had 18 centilitres of whiskey since arriving home.

The accused denied the charges from the beginning.

When the judge acquitted him, he noted that it could not be proven that he’d driven his car while under the influence.

The judge also noted an observation put forward by the Asian man's defence lawyer, that how alcohol is processed depends on ethnicity.

He told Swedish paper Nerikes Allehanda: ‘I read on the internet that it differs between different kinds of people.

‘Native Americans and Asians have a completely different metabolism and way of processing alcohol than western Europeans.’
