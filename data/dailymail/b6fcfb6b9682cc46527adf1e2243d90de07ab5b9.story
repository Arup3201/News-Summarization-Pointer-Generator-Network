Scottish spirit: Helena Bonham Carter has signed the letter

Sir Cliff Richard, Dame Judi Dench and Sir Mick Jagger yesterday joined an extraordinary list of celebrities signing a ‘love letter’ to the people of Scotland – pleading with them not to break up the 300-year-old union.

But the signatories were immediately bombarded with abusive remarks from supporters of independence who branded them ‘imperialists’, ‘uber-toffs’ and ‘irrelevant’.

More than 200 public figures – including Helena Bonham Carter, Dame Vera Lynn, Simon Cowell, Professor Stephen Hawking and Sir Bruce Forsyth – urged Scotland to vote No to leaving the UK in the letter that said: ‘Let’s stay together.’

The stars immediately became the target of so-called ‘cybernats’, or nationalist internet bullies.

One wrote that Sir Bruce was ‘nearly dead’, while another said they hoped ‘that old **** Bruce Forsyth takes a turn’ and accused him of being a paedophile.

The letter, which was organised by The One Show historian Dan Snow, states: ‘The decision on whether to leave our shared country is, of course, absolutely yours alone.

‘We want to let you know how very much we value our bonds of citizenship with you, and to express our hope that you will vote to renew them.’

Presenting the letter near Tower Bridge in London, Mr Snow said he hoped tens of thousands of supporters across the country would add their names to it online.

Mr Snow, son of former BBC election night star Peter Snow, said: ‘I feel passionately about Britain and everything we’ve achieved together throughout our long shared history across these islands.

‘This letter is for people who don’t have a vote in the referendum … they want to simply say we are not telling you how to vote but when you do vote we hope you don’t go.

‘I think some things are too important to be left to politicians. This is the biggest potential change to our county for generations and it will affect generations to come.’

Dear Friend, 

The decision on whether to leave our shared country is, of course, absolutely yours alone. Nevertheless, that decision will have a huge effect on all of us in the rest of the United Kingdom. 

We want to let you know how very much we value our bonds of citizenship with you, and to express our hope that you will vote to renew them. What unites us is much greater than what divides us. Let's stay together.

Yours,

The Rest of the United Kingdom 

Baroness Lawrence, whose teenage son Stephen was murdered by racists in 1993, has also backed the campaign.

Pro-independence campaigners have become known for their nasty online attacks on high-profile supporters of the union, including author JK Rowling.

Yesterday, the ‘cybernats’ accused Mr Snow and presenter Ben Fogle, who joined him at the launch, of being ‘two white middle-class English public school boys telling us how to live our lives’.

They tweeted a doctored image of Mr Snow holding up a placard that read: ‘Together we can ensure my father-in-law remains the richest man in the UK.’

Mr Snow’s wife, Lady Edwina Grosvenor, is the daughter of the Duke of Westminster, who is the tenth richest man in the country with a fortune of £8.5billion.

Others labelled the list of celebrities a ‘Who’s Who of the British Establishment’. One wrote: ‘A decade ago Sir Jimmy Savile would have been on that list.’

The pro-independence campaign last night released a reply to the letter, which said: ‘Dear friends, no need to worry – we aren’t moving anywhere after a Yes vote.’

An unnamed businessman has placed a £600,000 bet on Scots voting No to independence. He looks set to net a £133,333 profit if Scotland chooses to stay in the UK.
