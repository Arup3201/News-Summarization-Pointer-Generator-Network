Cardiff City face a Premier League investigation after owner Vincent Tan offered his players a £3.7million bonus before Sunday’s defeat by Tottenham.

Sportsmail can reveal Tan broke Premier League rules, which state every team must lodge their bonus schedule before the start of the season, when he gave his players a financialincentive to avoid relegation.

It is understood Tan did not offer the Cardiff squad a bonus to avoid the drop before the campaign began because he did not believe they would be in a relegation fight after his significant investment.

Instead, the controversial owner 
walked into Saturday evening’s team meeting at the Hilton Hotel on 
London’s Park Lane and stunned the players with his extraordinary offer.

Tan told the Cardiff squad they would ‘need to shoot more’ if they wanted the bonus at the end of the season.

He
 promised the squad, who were sitting open-mouthed, £3.7m to share 
between them if they survived their first season in the Barclays Premier
 League.

At the start of 
the campaign every club must register any bonuses not mentioned in 
players’ contracts with the Premier League to protect the integrity of 
the game at the highest level.

The
 regulation is designed to stop owners such as Tan using financial 
inducements to motivate players and other staff outside of their 
existing agreements.

However, clubs were given a month’s grace this year because of the new TV deals.

Many
 players believed they should take a bigger slice of the TV pool and 
several clubs could not reach agreement with them before the first game.
 Premier League chiefs gave every team a month to settle their affairs 
but they were not allowed to alter or make verbal agreements after these
 had been lodged.

Now the 
Premier League are to investigate the Cardiff owner after sources close 
to Tan confirmed he had made the offer to his players.

Tan breached Premier League rules T12 and T13 by offering a financial inducement outside of the players’ contracts.

According
 to T12: ‘Full details of a player’s remuneration, including all 
benefits to which he is entitled, whether in cash or in kind, shall be 
set out in his contract.’

T13 says: ‘The terms of a contract between a club and a player shall be strictly adhered to.

‘According
 to those players’ contracts, the bonus schedule agreed with the squad 
at the start of a season and lodged with the Premier League cannot be 
changed during  the season under any circumstances.’

Tan’s
 offer did not have the desired effect on Sunday at White Hart Lane, 
where Cardiff lost 1-0 to Tottenham following a first home goal in open
 play from £27m striker Roberto Soldado.

On Monday night the Premier League confirmed they would write to Tan to ask him for his observations.

The Premier League board have a number of options available to them if they  find Tan guilty of an offence, including a fine.

If
 the matter is deemed serious enough, it can be taken to an independent
 regulatory commission, where the sanctions - including fines and points
 deductions - are almost unlimited.

Cardiff
 seem to be hurtling towards relegation and are second from bottom in 
the Premier League table after losing three of their last four league 
games.

Malky Mackay’s 
sacking in December after a series of clashes with Tan over transfer 
policy and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s appointment as manager have resulted 
in a dramatic drop-off in form.

The
 players are in open revolt against the club hierarchy and Solskjaer, in
 his first job in the Premier League, seems unable to motivate them.

The
 former Manchester United striker’s authority was significantly 
undermined on Saturday evening when Tan arrived at the team hotel and 
announced he would be addressing the players.

As the Norwegian stepped aside, Tan declared his offer to the Cardiff squad.

A
 spokesman for the billionaire Malaysian businessman said on Monday night: 
‘We didn’t realise it was against regulations. Vincent Tan has now 
rescinded the offer.’
