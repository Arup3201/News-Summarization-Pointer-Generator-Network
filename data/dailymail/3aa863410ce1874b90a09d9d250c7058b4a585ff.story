An Ohio mother was jailed Tuesday night after allegedly forcing her way into her daughter's middle school and attacking a student she believed was bullying her child.

Irea Nall, 29, has been charged with assault in connection to an incident that took place last week at Groveport Madison Middle School South in Franklin County.

According to police, Nall marched down to the school and slipped through the front door equipped with a camera and buzzer as another visitor was leaving.

Bad role model: Police say the mother of two jumped on a cafeteria table, kicked at food and struck a student on the head with a bottle

The mother proceeded to scream at school staff and allegedly pushed away a dean who confronted her about her conduct, Columbus Dispatch reported.

The school has a system in place that requires all visitors to show an ID and speak with a security guard before being escorted to the main office, but Nall reportedly disregarded all the safety procedures.   

As teachers began to evacuate the building in accordance with the school safety protocol, Nall made her way to the cafeteria, police said.

Once in the lunchroom, Nall jumped on a table, kicked some of the children's meals to the floor and walked to a girl that her daughter had accused of being a bully.

But the mother ended up hitting another student on the head with a bottle. The confrontation also left an administrator injured after he fell trying to stop Nall.

The mother eventually left the building with her daughter in tow. According to the school, the girl has not been subjected to any bullying.

Nall turned herself in last Sunday and was charged with assault, inciting panic and aggravated trespassing.

Her young daughter also faces one count of disorderly conduct.

The 29-year-old woman, who also has a younger son, has been documenting her ordeal on her Facebook page, where she shared her mugshot, lamenting that police had not used a more attractive photo of her.

She appeared in court Tuesday morning and was ordered held on a $25,000 bond. Her next court appearance is scheduled for next week.

Nall's neighbor Sandy Pack told NBC4i she was stunned by the charges against the mother of two, whom she described as a good parent.

‘I am just wondering what really made her trigger go off,’ Miss Pack said. ‘There has to be some reason why, because she is very protective of her children.’
