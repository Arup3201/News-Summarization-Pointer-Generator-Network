A single mother was devastated to discover the man she planned to marry was actually a con artist who stole from her to pay for his wedding to another woman.

Stephen Sutton, 48, swept Dawn Rothwell, 46, from Swadlincote, Derbyshire, off her feet after they met online in May 2011 and they soon became engaged.

But she told The Mirror she was stunned when she found out their relationship was based on a 'pack of lies' and he actually had three other fiancees.

Conned: Dawn Rothwell believed her fiance had a brain tumour but his 'hospital visits' gave him an excuse to see another woman

One of his shocking betrayals involved telling Dawn he had a brain tumour so he wouldn't be able to spend Christmas with her. 

She explains: 'I was horrified. He told
 me his only hope was Proton therapy in the States straight away. 
Christmas disappeared. All I wanted was for him to get better.'

But while Dawn spent Christmas 2011 praying Stephen would survive his treatment, he was actually 20 miles away enjoying dinner with his other fiancee - Beverley Wright, 59.

Jailed: Stephen Sutton stole from Dawn to pay for his wedding to Beverley Wright

Beverley and Dawn had no idea they were both engaged to the father-of-two, who they later discovered also had another two fiancees.

When Dawn saw Sutton after Christmas he lied that the treatment in the U.S. hadn't worked and he now needed chemotherapy. She believes he even shaved his head to make it appear he was losing his hair.

He also convinced Dawn she would need to care for his sons, aged six and 12, after his death.

She said: 'He seemed to be in hospital 
for weeks, texting most days, saying how much he loved me. But even 
after he was supposedly discharged he claimed he didn't feel ready to 
see me.'

All the time she thought Sutton was getting life-saving treatment, he was actually with his other women.

He married Beverley in March 2012 and in another blow to Dawn, paid for the wedding using money he had stolen from her.

Dawn, who has two children from a previous relationship, had given Sutton valuable family heirlooms to look after. He used her £30,000 jewellery collection to fund his nuptials, telling his other bride that he had found the bag of gold in his father's attic.

Dawn said: 'It was mainly family heirlooms - 
hundreds of pieces, including solid gold necklaces, earrings and diamond
 rings. He warned me I shouldn't leave it lying around in case I got 
burgled. I knew he was right. It had a lot of sentimental value too. 
Most of it could never be replaced. So when he offered to store it in 
his safe, I let him.'

Around the time Sutton married Beverley, Dawn finally suspected he was up to no good but still believed his tumour was the reason they were 'drifting apart'. She arranged to meet him to end their relationship and get her valuables back but the jewellery boxes he returned were virtually empty.

Betrayed: Dawn had no idea Stephen and Beverley, pictured, had married - or that he used her family heirlooms to pay for it

She recalled: 'There were only a few cheap brooches left. All my family heirlooms had gone. Even the 'I Love Nanny' necklace my grandson had given me had vanished. Stephen had taken the lot. I went straight to the police.'

Sutton was arrested and charged with theft. He pleaded guilty at Leicester Crown Court last April and jailed for two years.

The judge told him he had carried out a 'cruel and persistent deception' adding he had played with Dawn's emotions 'to deflect her attention from the theft.'

Equally shocked: Beverley didn't know about Dawn and said she's angry Stephen 'pulled the wool over my eyes'

Dawn said she's glad Sutton is now behind bars so he 'can't con anyone else'. It was only in court that she discovered he had never been ill and had three other women.

His wife, care assistant Beverley, was equally stunned to discover she was not Sutton's one and only and they are now getting divorced.

She told the Mirror: 'I felt completely humiliated. I was disgusted in him but I more angry with myself. I'd let him pull the wool over my eyes and the more I thought about it, the more clues I’d ignored.'
