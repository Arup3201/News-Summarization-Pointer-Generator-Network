A young boy who became stranded on a frozen river as the ice began to crack under his feet has been rescued by a team of firefighters. 

Fire Department New York City were called to the Bronx River at just after 4.30pm yesterday after reports a ten-year-old boy was trapped on the ice.

The youngster had gone out onto the treacherous ice with a girl when she fell through the ice. The girl was able to pull herself onto nearby rocks and climb out of the river.

But the 'terrified' boy was still standing on the  thin ice when the fire department arrived to save him.

It took a team of firefighters in cold water gear just a couple of minutes to rescue the boy who is now being treated for exposure.

Captain Thomas Yuneman said the ice had been cracking beneath the youngster's feet when he arrived and warned him to stand still and stay calm.

Members of the team threw the boy a life preserver and two of the rescuers had attempted to make their way to him but the ice would not support their weight- plunging them into the freezing river in New York.

They then lowered a ladder across the ice for him to climb across to safety. 

The boy, who never fell into the water, and one of his rescuers were transported to a hospital.

Firefighter Chris Harkinish said: 'The ice was very thin and the situation could have been much worse.' 

'Within two minutes we had him coming to shore,' added Captain Yuneman.
