Head coach Pete Carroll gave an impassioned defence of his star running back Marshawn Lynch, who uttered the words: 'I'm here so I won't get fined' 27 times to questions on media day.

'I think that you're seeing a demonstration of a guy being himself and not being what everybody wants him to be. That is why you will continue to hear our players support him,' Carroll told reporters in his Wednesday press conference.

'He's trying to do the best job he can of being him, and maybe you don't feel that that's what he should do, but that is what is going on. In that sense, he's being true to himself and we understand that.

'I understand that people would like to see him do different things. He's not comfortable with that, so that's what he's telling you. He's doing it exactly the way he knows how to do it best.

'That conversation about supporting the person that he is, we talk about all the time. That is a mainstay of our conversation within going along with what it's all about, which is being a team member and he's an incredible team member.

'This environment just isn't one that you get to see him in the way you want to see him. You're seeing him as he is and in that regard, it is what it is.'

The enigmatic 28-year-old appeared for compulsory media duties Seattle's hotel on Wednesday morning wearing a trademark Beast Mode cap.

It is likely he will attract another fine for his actions, with safety Kam Chancellor backing up his team-mate.

'It's childish. They're focusing on the wrong thing. It's about this game right now. It's the Patriots vs the Seahawks. It's not about a hat. It's about this game right now.

'That is what they are taking away from us. It's not about a hat. It's about football. The people, the media, those guys that don't care about a hat and care about football, they want to see us battle and compete and show good sportsmanship.'
