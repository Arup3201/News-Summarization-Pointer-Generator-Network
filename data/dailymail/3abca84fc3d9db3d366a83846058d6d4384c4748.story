House Speaker John Boehner once joked that his busy schedule made him feel like a wind-up toy, so his staff bought him a wind-up monkey that crashes symbols together.

Now Mr Boehner has showed off his clapping simian in a video – and it makes for slightly cringeworthy viewing.

Mr Boehner, who as Speaker of the House of Representatives is second in line to the U.S presidency after the Vice President, doesn’t look awfully fond of his grinning primate.

Simian similarity: John Boehner says that he relates to his clapping monkey because his staff wind him up 'every 15 minutes'

His staff say that the monkey is the second-most photographed item in the Speaker’s office, after the Speaker himself. It has photobombed at least 29 official photographs to date.

In the video Mr Boehner explains to a group of girls why the monkey is in his office.

He said: ‘[The monkey’] sits in my office on the coffee table because this [pointing at it] is me. That’s what I do all day [as the monkey claps]. My staff wind me up about every 15 minutes and I do my thing.’

Center of attention: The monkey always sits in the middle of meetings

It was recently revealed that Mr Boehner is almost unmatched when it comes to fundraising for the Republican party.

He has raised more than $43million for accounts under his direct control and helped amass tens of millions more for Republican allies.

The Ohio lawmaker accounts for about one-fifth of the cash collected by House Republicans' campaign arm, the National Republican Congressional Committee. Boehner has written almost $18 million in checks to the group, which has raised $101 million this campaign cycle.
