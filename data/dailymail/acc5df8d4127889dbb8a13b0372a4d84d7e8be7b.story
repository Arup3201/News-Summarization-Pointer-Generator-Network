Fresh from his match-winning performance against Southampton on Wednesday night, Alexis Sanchez showed off another of his talents at the launch of an Arsenal-funded homeless facility.

The Gunners forward, who netted the winning goal against Saints, teamed up with midfielder Santi Cazorla to cook a feast of healthy food at Centrepoint's new health and wellbeing centre.

Centrepoint are Arsenal's charity of the season and layers, staff and fans raised over £500,000 to refurbish a building on Dean Street in London, creating a place for young homeless people to visit.

Sanchez and Cazorla turned up to launch the project on Thursday and wasted no time getting their hands dirty, helping to prepare food alongside volunteers.

The former Barcelona star has been a huge hit since arriving at the Emirates for £30million last summer and he was more than happy to give up his time.  

'I'm not in Chile this Christmas to help the poor, but this year, the club is helping me keep up the tradition of giving and today's (Thursday's) visit is about just that,' said Sanchez.

'This centre will give people a chance at a better life. A chance to get back on their feet which is such an important start on life's journey.' 

The players' visit came ahead of Arsenal's dedicated charity matchday, where Arsene Wenger and his squad donate a day's wages to fund projects to help young people.
