The man accused of murdering five-year-old April Jones sat yards from her parents yesterday to recall what he claims were her last moments alive.

Mark Bridger tearfully called her  ‘little April’ and insisted he never meant to kill her.

As the girl’s sobbing mother fled court, the 47-year-old former slaughterhouse worker insisted he ran April over and bundled her into his car in a panic.

Evidence: Mark Bridger cried as he gave an oath on the bible as he entered the witness box for the first time today, and described the moment he claims he ran April Jones over

For the first time, he admitted 
recalling that he had lain her lifeless body down in front of his 
fireplace at his cottage – even though he said he had lost all memory of
how she got there because he was drunk.

But he told a jury he did not abduct her, did not have any sexual contact with her and did not murder her.

Nor did he have any recollection of 
what he did with her body. When he woke up the next morning, he claimed:
‘I really thought it was a nightmare… then I realised, “this is not a 
dream”.’

At one stage April’s mother Coral, 
sitting hand in hand with her husband Paul in the  gallery of Mold Crown
Court, choked back tears and left as Bridger described what he referred
to only as ‘the incident’.

Bereft: April's parents Paul and Coral Jones arrive at court today. The couple have been in the public gallery throughout

Claims: Bridger says he had drunk so much alcohol after 'crushing' April, five, with his Land Rover (pictured), he could not remember what he did with her body

In the dock: Murder suspect Mark Bridger gripped a tissue as he revealed details of his previous convictions and private life during his trial

In answer to questions from his 
defence counsel, Brendan Kelly QC, he rebutted the accusations that he 
kidnapped her in a sexually motivated crime, murdered her, disposed of 
her body and cleaned up the evidence. He also offered a series of 
explanations to the allegations.

Evidence: Accused Mark Bridger told the court of his previous offences today to try to prove that he did not abduct and murder April Jones

Blood specks in his bathroom could 
have come from washing his fleece after he cradled April’s ‘crushed’ 
body in his car, he said.

The so-called clean-up? ‘I don’t 
remember any clean-up, but what I would like to say is if there was 
blood dripped, and blood in the bath where I washed my jumper, if I had 
seen it, I would have automatically wiped it up. But it was not to try 
and hide anything.’

Bone fragments in his wood-burning 
stove, he implied, could have come from a chicken meal he cooked his 
children – he always threw the bones in the embers.

Would he have put 
any parts of a human skeleton in the fire? ‘No, no,’ he replied. ‘I 
don’t believe I could do that. I really don’t.’

He did now recall laying April down in
front of the fire. The jury heard earlier how a small pool of her blood
was found beneath the carpet there.

Earlier the court heard that Bridger, 
born in Surrey, moved to Wales after getting his girlfriend pregnant in 
the 1980s.

He fathered another five children by three more women and had
a string of relationships, at least one involving violent 
confrontation.

He once threatened a police officer with a machete when they were called to a domestic dispute at his home.

Although he told locals he had been in the Army, he now admits he had never served in the military.

The Crown says he snatched April the 
day his last girlfriend ditched him – and spent the hours beforehand 
viewing child porn and images of local girls on his computer.

Cross-examining yesterday, Elwen Evans QC asked him: ‘Where is April, Mr
Bridger?’ ‘I don’t know,’ he replied.

Later Miss Evans asked him: ‘How 
easy do you find it to lie through your teeth?’ ‘Not at all,’ Bridger 
replied. ‘I don’t find it easy, no.’

Bridger denies abduction, murder and perverting the course of justice.

The trial continues.

Trial: Mark Bridger arrives at Mold Crown Court, North Wales today: April Jones disappeared on October 1 last year and despite the biggest search in British criminal history her body has never been found

Mark Bridger's QC Brendan Kelly took the court through the accused's personal life, which produced six children from four different mothers.

Mr Kelly began with a three or four year relationship with a woman called Keely Reynolds, with whom he had a son. He was working at a timeshare estate as a barman, chef and waiter, before meeting a new partner.

'I met a young lady I was working with and within three months we were married,' Bridger told the jury. The woman was Julie Wiliams and they lived in mid Wales and also in Wrexham and Chirk.

Bridger had two sons from that relationship, now aged 21 and 23, and is still in contact with one of them, he said.

Bridger then broke up with Ms Williams but stayed in the Machynlleth area, working as a car recovery mechanic and in a forestry job and began a relationship with a woman called Vanessa Brooks.

That lasted for two or three years but there were no children until Bridger met Elaine Griffiths in 1996.

'It was a group of lads, we all hung about together, we all got on and would meet up with groups of girls from different villages and go out dancing,' Bridger said.

Elaine had a sister, Karen, who at that time was in a relationship with a man he knew as Paul - the father of April Jones.

'It was through Elaine and Karen I met Paul,' Bridger said.

The relationship with Elaine Griffiths lasted eight years until 2003, and they had two children.
