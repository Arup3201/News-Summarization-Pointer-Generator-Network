Carmen the 9-year-old boxer that has been praised for her heroism during a deadly house fire in Ohio is showing signs of improvement.

The pooch who was found covering her owner Ben Ledford's face as his home in Goshen Township burned last Thursday, today was taken off the ventilator and was breathing on her own.

Ledford, 33, did not survive despite his dog's efforts. He was laid to rest Tuesday.

On the mend: Carmen, a 9-year-old boxer, was taken off the ventilator and was breathing on her own six days after her owner was killed in a house fire 

Tragic: Owner Ben Ledford died after the fire despite his dog's brave efforts to save him by shielding his face from the smoke with her body 

Carmen was rushed in critical condition to CARE Center veterinary clinic in Cincinnati last week suffering from severe damage to her lungs cause by smoke inhalation.   

'A lot of dogs instinctively know when there’s a crisis going on and so a lot of them do go try to protect their owners,' said veterinarian Dr. Marlo Anderson.

After a weekend spent in an oxygen chamber being fed fluids intravenously, the hulking canine began to turn the corner Monday.

On Tuesday morning, the team at CARE Center posted an update on their Facebook page sharing the good news that Carman was taken off the ventilator and her vital signs were holding steady. 

The 9-year-old dog is currently getting oxygen through a nasal tube and is starting to wake up from the sedative drugs.

The critical care staff were expecting to see Carman up fully awake and moving around by Wednesday.

‘She's doing very well. We're very happy with where her progress is at this point,’ Dr. Marlo Anderson, the critical care specialist, told WCPO.

Once Carmen recovers, her owner's brother, Philip Ledford, plans to adopt her.

Emily Leford, Ben and Philip’s sister, said her late brother had a very special relationship with his pet.

‘There was nothing in this world that Ben loved more than Carmen and there was nothing that Carmen loved more than Ben,’ she told the site.

Mr Ledford has set up a donations page to help with Carmen’s medical bills.

As of late Tuesday night, the campaign has drawn more than $19,000in donations, inching towards the $25,000 goal. 

‘While we're not out of the woods yet and there is still significant care that she needs, her chances of survival have increased,’ the Ledford family wrote on the fundraiser page. ‘We're hopeful that we will actually be able to take her home one day.’

At least one person, Ron Mitchell, attempted to get Ben Ledford to safety before firefighters arrived but the fire and smoke were too much for him.

'I tried to climb through the front door. I got about a bodies length in and the smoke was so thick that I had to come back out and then I went around the back of the door in back of the house and saw that the dryer vent that was on the back that window to the basement was on fire,' he said.

Ledford was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at Bethesda North Hospital, though he displayed signs of life when medics first reached him in the basement. 

Carmen was found laying across her owner's face, apparently trying to protect the 33-year-old from smoke and heat from the fire.
