Mexican police are still searching hospitals for the thieves who exposed themselves to fatal amounts of radiation by opening a container of 'extremely dangerous' stolen Cobalt-60 earlier this week.

The truck transporting the highly radioactive material was stolen on Tuesday and located the following day about a kilometer from the farming town of Hueypoxtla. The cobalt-60 was discovered opened in a an empty parking lot not far from the truck, which means the thieves are most likely suffering from radiation poisoning.

'They will eventually have to go to a hospital, and we'll be waiting for them,' Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission official Mardonio Jimenez said.

Who did it? The container went missing on Tuesday while en route to a waste facility. It was recovered the next day, but opened which means that whoever opened is probably suffering from radiation poisoning

According to Juan Eibenschutz, director general of the National Commission of Nuclear Safety and Safeguards, the shipment of Cobalt-60 was Category 1 meaning 'it would probably be fatal to be close to this amount of unshielded radioactive material for a period in the range of a few minutes to an hour.'

Authorities are now in the process of containing the material in order to transport it to a waste site, which they estimate will take about two days.

'It's a very delicate operation. What's important is that the material has been located and the place is being watched to guarantee no one gets close,' Juan Eibenschutz, director of the National Commission of Nuclear Safety and Safeguards, told the Associated Press.

The container was discovered by a family, who were promptly put under medical observation, but according to Hueypoxtla's mayor, Javier Santillan, they suffered no harm.

The truck marked 'Transportes Ortiz' left Tijuana on November 28 and was on its way to a nuclear waste facility when the driver stopped to rest at a gas station in Tepojaco, in Hidalgo state north of Mexico City.

The driver, Valentin Escamilla Ortiz, told authorities he was sleeping in the truck when two men with a gun approached about 1:30am Tuesday. They made him get out, tied his hands and feet and left him in a vacant lot nearby.

When he was able to free himself, he ran back to the gas station to get help.

Police and military quickly joined the hunt to find the missing cobalt-60 because it could be used by terrorists to create a 'dirty bomb'.

But authorities don't believe that the thieves who stole the truck did it to intentionally steal the cobalt-60.

Eibenschutz said that the thieves were mostly likely after the white 2007 Volkswagon cargo vehicle.

On average, a half dozen thefts of radioactive materials are reported in Mexico each year and none have proven to be aimed at the cargo, Eibenschutz said. He said that in all the cases the thieves were after shipping containers or the vehicles.

Unintentional thefts of radioactive materials are not uncommon, said an official familiar with cases reported by International Atomic Energy Agency member states, who was not authorized to comment on the case. In some cases, radioactive sources have ended up being sold as scrap, causing serious harm to people who unknowingly come into contact with it.

In a Mexican case in the 1970s, one thief died and the other was injured when they opened a container holding radioactive material, he said.

The container was junked and sold to a foundry, where it contaminated some steel reinforcement bars made there. Eibenschutz said all foundries in Mexico now have equipment to detect radioactive material.

On the lookout: Mexican authorities scrambled Wednesday to find a truck containing 'extremely dangerous' radioactive material used in medical treatment. The truck and its contents have now been found seperately
