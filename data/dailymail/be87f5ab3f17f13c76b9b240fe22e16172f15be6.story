With the summer sales in full swing, you would have thought the department stores would be desperate to encourage us to shop till we drop.

But one luxury chain has taken a rather different approach – warning customers that carrying too many shopping bags could be a health risk.

Harvey Nichols has teamed up with TV doctor Rosemary Leonard to tell shoppers they risk pulled muscles, neck strains – even fainting – if they don’t balance their bags correctly or overload themselves with too many bargains.

The store 
is very precise in its medical advice, telling customers that when they 
have enough bags to stretch 11in along their arms, they should stop 
shopping. It has even issued arm bands to help them mark the cut-off 
point.

Meanwhile
 bargain-hunters intent on a massive shopping spree are advised to order
 online so they can have the bags delivered straight to their front 
door.

Dr
 Leonard, who is BBC Breakfast’s resident doctor and a part-time GP, 
said: ‘It might sound silly but carrying numerous bags can put untold 
physical pressure on a shopper’s body.

‘Restriction of blood flow is common, 
which means people can experience tingling of the fingers and in more 
extreme cases numbness and even fainting. I often refer to this 
condition as “high bag pressure”.

'Other symptoms an overburdened shopper
 could suffer include pulled muscles plus neck and wrist strain. As a GP
 I see more cases of shopping-related stress injuries when the economy 
is booming.

‘The best thing to do on a spree is to carry a few bags on each arm to balance the load.’

A
 spokesman for Harvey Nichols, whose sales started this week, said: 
‘It’s not in our interests to have customers shop until they drop.

‘For
 those wanting to make multiple purchases – and concerned about carrying
 a heavy load – we would advise using our website and let our delivery 
drivers take the strain.’

But it’s not just bulging shopping bags that are causing concern among doctors.

Previously, the British Osteopathic Association revealed that four in ten women have suffered discomfort in  their neck, back or shoulders from regularly carrying a heavy handbag.

Apparently it hasn’t put off savvy shoppers. Research has revealed how women walk up to 154 miles a year hunting for bargains – the equivalent of trekking from London to Nottingham.

The Debenhams poll of 2,000 women revealed the average woman covers 2.96 miles on a shopping trip and spends around 2.5 hours browsing in stores every week.

In contrast, men spend just an average 50 minutes and cover just 1.5 miles per week.

Women also burn around five calories for every minute spent shopping – almost 48,000 per year – according to a separate poll.
