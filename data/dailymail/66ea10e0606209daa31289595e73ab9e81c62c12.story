The online knitting store saw sales rise 23 per cent on 29 December as high winds and stormy weather swept the UK.

Fuelled by bad weather and the increase of celebrity fans, knitting is an increasingly popular pastime in the UK

The extreme weather conditions clearly reminded the nation why we need winter knits as knitters logged on in their droves to stock up on yarn and other knitting essentials.

Sales peaked again on New Year’s Day as the bad weather continued to keep many people inside their homes.

The boom in the traditional craft has been fuelled by celebrity knitters like Kate Moss, Julia Roberts  and Mad Men star Christina Hendricks.

Craft queen Kirstie Allsopp was voted best celebrity knitter during National Knitting Week last October.

January is traditionally the busiest month in the knitting calendar and it seems this year won’t be any different.
