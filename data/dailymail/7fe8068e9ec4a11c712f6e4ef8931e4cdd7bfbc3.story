Destiny's Child might have rocked some of the most iconic fashion looks of the 1990s, but Beyoncé has come a long way since letting her mother dress her for the stage.

The global superstar has kicked off her Mrs Carter Show tour in outfits designed by some of the world's top fashion houses.

Julien Macdonald, Dsquared2, and Ralph and Russo have all contributed to her showstopping stage wardrobe and today Italian label Pucci released inception sketches of their creations for the 31-year-old megastar.

Peter Dundas, Emilio Pucci Creative Director, worked with Beyoncé to create costumes for her tour

Peter Dundas, Emilio Pucci Creative Director, worked with Beyoncé to create costumes that resonate with the singer's 'modern take on glamour'.

Dundas drew inspiration from the Fall/Winter 2013-14 Show Collection, reinterpreting the rock goddess theme through fabrics and proportions.

This allows for the 'complexity of choreography and complements the theatrical storytelling' of the Mrs. Carter Show, which began yesterday in Belgrade, Serbia.  

Pucci's purple design was instantly recognisable as Beyoncé stepped on stage wearing a pair of high-waisted pastel shorts featuring their signature 1960s psychedelic print.

Thigh-high leather boots, a double-breasted leather coat and wide-brimmed hat completed the sexy look

The shorts were paired with a cropped, beaded jacket in a cool lavender shade that she left just a little bit unzipped. The outfit was topped with a wide belt in a beige and black striped animal print.

Another of Pucci's outfits is a 1990s gangster outfit given a sexy twist.

The all-leather ensemble includes a large, wide-brimmed hat - which Beyoncé disposed of for part of her performance - a short black double-breasted coat and thigh-high boots, all in leather.

While the Crazy In Love signer didn't appear to be wearing anything in the form of bottoms underneath the coat, she sported her favourite flesh-coloured fishnet tights.

A third Pucci outfit for the tour features a scooped neck sparkling black bodysuit with a silver zip on each side, teamed with thigh-high leather boots.

Other Peter Dundas designs include a green tasseled mini-dress and a plunging v-neck version of the bodysuit.

Beyoncé has 64 more shows on the tour which will see her travel across Europe, North America and South America.

She had been due to play eight shows in Britain 
starting April 29th, but following a huge demand for the tickets she has 
now added three more gigs to her tour with new additional appearances at London's O2 Arena on 4 and 5 May, and the Manchester Arena on 9 May. She will also perform two gigs in Birmingham.

Other outfits by Pucci include a green tasseled dress and a v-neck, plunging version of the bodysuit
