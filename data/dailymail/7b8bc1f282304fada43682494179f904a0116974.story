A body found off the shores of a California beach is that of an 18-year-old cliff diver who was reported missing after jumping into the water on Wednesday afternoon, law enforcement officials confirmed on Sunday.

Joseph Sanchez was last seen jumping from a cliff at Abalone Cove Shoreline Park about 40 miles south of Los Angeles. According to a friend who witnessed the jump, Sanchez jumped in but was knocked into rocks in a cove by the strong surf before the water swept him into a sea cave.

About 11:30 a.m. Sunday, his body was found inside a sea cave just 50 yards from where he was last seen jumping.

Rescue: Rescuers looked for days for Sanchez's body, often battling massive waves and strong currents

Search: Sanchez's family and friends setup camp at a cliff overlooking where he was last seen as they aided in the recovery effort

The body was first seen by one of Sanchez's relatives, many of whom had been camped up on a cliff overlooking the cove where Sanchez was last seen jumping since Wednesday, KTLA reports

The family had been assisting law enforcement in looking for the teen.

Inspiration Point, where Sanchez and his friends had been cliff jumping, has become a popular spot for thrill-seeking teens. But the strong currents and rocky coastline make it a very dangerous spot for people to swim.

Toogee Zepeda, a friend of Sanchez who was with him at the time of his fateful jump, told police he jumped in after him but left to call for help after the two became powerless to the crashing waves.

Lifeguards rushed to the scene to try and help Sanchez - who was last seen clinging to rocks - but it was too late, he was already consumed by the sea.

Divers searched for Sanchez for the rest of the day but came up empty.

On Thursday, the rescue effort had shifted to a recovery mission.

According to KTLA, the coroner's office will conduct an autopsy to determine Sanchez's cause of death.
