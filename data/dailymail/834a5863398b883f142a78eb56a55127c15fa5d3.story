A knitter has been awarded a British Empire Medal - after sending 13,000 colourful woolly hats to soldiers serving overseas.

Tina Selby, 51, set up the Hats For Heroes campaign because she did not want British troops to get cold on the front line.

She had originally planned to send around 500 colourful beanies to servicemen stationed in Afghanistan, after reading how the morale of service personnel can be boosted by receiving treats from home.

However, after starting her efforts in 2009, Mrs Selby found she could not stop making the hats and ended-up recruiting a small army of knitters to help her.

She has also been sent hats from other crafty types who heard about her campaign, and has received cash donations enabling her to buy more wool.

As the beanies are only worn when the troops are off duty, Mrs Selby says they do not have to be in any particular colour, but has advised those taking part in the campaign not to use white or fluorescent wool for safety reasons.

Winters in Afghanistan can be particularly harsh, with temperatures dropping as low as -20c, making the hats a must have accessory for many servicemen and women.

Depending on the style knitted, it takes around one or two balls of wool to make the hats - typically costing between £5 and £10 depending on the type of yarn used.

Mrs Selby has now been honoured for her 'innovative' campaign, based out of her home in Penarth near Cardiff, Wales.

However, she says her efforts are a 'drop in the ocean' compared to the work done by the soldiers fighting on foreign soil.

She added: 'I was proud and humbled to receive the award. It was nice to have the recognition but I didn't do it for that.'

Mrs Selby set up the campaign in 2010 and plans to send out a total of 17,000 hats before she is finished, meaning she has another 4,000 to go.

With the withdrawal from Afghanistan now underway as of the end of 2013 there were around 5,200 troops left in Helmand Province - compared to the end of June 2011 when there were roughly 9,500.

Mrs Selby says she now has enough hats to cover the final deployment in Afghanistan and has asked her knitters to down tools so the final consignment can be posted out.
