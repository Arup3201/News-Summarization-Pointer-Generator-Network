Eurostar passengers could see reduced fares after the European Commission warned France and Britain they faced court action unless charges for passenger and freight trains using the Channel Tunnel were reduced.

The Commission said the illegally high track access charges result in higher ticket prices for passengers of the high-speed Eurostar service linking London with Paris and Brussels.

Both countries have been given two months to respond to the request.

Good news: Eurostar passengers could see a reduction in fares

A spokesman for the Commission said today: 'Passengers are paying over the odds for
their tickets, freight operators and their customers are being 
overcharged, and overall the current regime is stifling growth in the 
rail sector.'

She added the high charges meant only 43 per cent of the tunnel's capacity was used.

Tunnel operator Eurotunnel charges a reservation fee of 4,320 euros one way for Eurostar trains and 16.60 euros per passenger.

EU officials said the charges should be roughly half that amount.

EU officials said if the charges were lower, the tunnel could make up the difference through increased freight traffic, forecasting a doubling of the amount of daily freight trains.

Under EU law, rail companies are only allowed to charge fees consistent with the amount of wear caused by a train journey.

But the officials said the Commission investigation found operators of the Channel Tunnel were charging more than necessary and using the income to subsidise the operator's car shuttle service, which does not pay such charges.

Officials said the tunnel had sought an exception to levy higher access charges to pay construction costs. They said the investigation did not find evidence to support this, and noted that Eurotunnel's financing costs declined significantly after a write-off in 2007.

In addition to access charges, Commission regulators found that a 65-year usage agreement that reserves 50 percent of traffic for French national rail operator Societe Nationale de Chemins de Fer and Germany's DB Schenker, a unit of Deutsche Bahn, violated EU rules because of its length.

The tunnel's own rail regulator is also too weak, they said, and the railway operators have too much control.
