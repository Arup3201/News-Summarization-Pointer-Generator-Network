Russian police are hunting a 'granny-killing sadist' who has 'murdered 32 pensioners' in two years after posing as a housing official and gaining entry to their homes.

His victims were aged between 80 and 90, and he killed them by strangulation, say police in the Ural.

Police labelled him a 'sadist' because the murders are not based on stealing money or belongings from the helpless 'babushkas'.

Granny killer: Police images of the suspect show him to be aged 25 to 35, and between 170 and 175 cm tall. He is believed to have central Asian appearance, to live in an unknown city, and 'to be of a low social and wealth level'

'The 'maniac' appears only interested in strangling them to death,' reported The Siberian Times.

'The killer's tactics show similarities between him and Russia's worst-ever female killer 'Satan in a Skirt', Irina Gaidamachuk, who was jailed for 20 years after killing 17 elderly women, prompting concerns he is a copycat killer. 

'Her murderous spree was also in the Urals.'

Police have offered a one million rouble reward - £19,325 - for information leading to his arrest.  Elderly residents have been warned to take additional precautions in opening their doors to strangers.

Large reach: Among the regions where he is alleged to have struck are Sverdlovsk, Chelybinsk, Tatarstan and Samara, all on the western fringes of Siberia

Do you know this man? Police have offered a one million rouble reward - £19,325 - for information leading to his arrest.  Elderly residents have been warned to take additional precautions in opening their doors to strangers

Police images of the suspect show him to be aged 25 to 35, and between 170 and 175 cm tall. He is believed to have central Asian appearance, to live in an unknown city, and 'to be of a low social and wealth level'.

The murders span a wide area of Russian bordering the western fringe of Siberia, said police.

Among the regions where he is alleged to have struck are Sverdlovsk, Chelybinsk, Tatarstan and Samara.

Alexander Shulga, senior assistant to the Head of Sverdlovsk Region Investigative Committee said: 'The police are after a serial killer who murders  lonely elderly women.

'Satan in a skirt': Police said the killer's tactics show similarities between him and Russia's worst-ever female killer Irina Gaidamachuk, who was jailed last year for 20 years after killing 17 elderly women, prompting concerns he is a copycat killer

'A criminal investigation is launched under article 105 - murder - of the Russian Criminal code.'

Police have his DNA from a murder scene in Ekaterinburg in 2012 where he killed two elderly pensioners.

He left a handkerchief and a light at the crime scene, said investigators.

Mother of two Gaidamachuk, 42, was last year jailed until 2032 for her campaign of murder. Posing as a social worker, her victims were aged 61 to 89.

While she strangled some victims, she killed others by smashing their skulls with a hammer or axe.

Unlike the latest killer, she did steal small amounts of cash from her victims.

'I just wanted to be a normal mother but I had a craving for drink. My husband Yury wouldn't give me money for vodka.' she said.
