FC Goa midfielder Robert Pires has been suspended for two games in the inaugural Indian Super League after allegedly being involved in a half-time altercation with Atletico de Kolkata coach Antonio Lopez Habas.

After Thursday's game, which featured seven yellow cards, Goa coach Zico claimed the former Arsenal man had been punched by Habas, with both clubs submitting written reports to the ISL governing body on Friday.

A disciplinary committee of the All India Football Federation (AIFF) on Saturday stated Pires had been suspended for two matches, with Habas banned for four.

Both Pires and Habas were fined 500,000 rupees (£5,071) each, and each have four days to submit an appeal.

Habas had previously been warned for his behaviour following Atletico's 2-0 win over North East United on October 16.

A statement read: 'Robert Pires of FC Goa has been suspended for next two matches of Indian Super League and fined Rs 5,00,000 (Rupees Five Lakh) for breach of All India Football Federation disciplinary code (article 58) of offensive behaviour and fair play.

'Antonio Lopez Habas, head coach of Atletico de Kolkata has been suspended for next four matches of Indian Super League and fined Rs 500,000 (Rupees Five Lakh) for breach of All India Football Federation disciplinary code (article 58) of offensive behaviour and fair play for the second time.

'Antonio Lopez Habas was previously summoned with a warning by the AIFF's disciplinary committee under its article 58, earlier on October 18, 2014.'

Pires, who was part of Arsenal's 'Invincibles' squad which went unbeaten throughout the 2003-04 Premier League season en route to winning the title, was heavily involved in Goa's 2-1 home defeat, which put them in sixth place.

Atletico striker Fikru Lemessa, an Ethiopia international, was also confirmed to have been suspended for two games and fined, though the exact nature of his disciplinary breach was unclear.

Pires was unwilling to give a reaction to the AIFF decision, when contacted. Atletico de Kolkata were also unavailable for comment.
