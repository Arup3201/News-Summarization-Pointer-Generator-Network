Premium Bond holders stand less of a chance of winning a payout after National Savings & Investments announced that it was cutting prize payouts.

NS&I will reduce the annual Premium Bond prize fund rate from 1.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent from the start of next month, it revealed this morning.

The cut means the odds of each £1 Bond number winning a prize will lengthen to 26,000 to 1 from 24,000 to 1 for the 22million investors who hold them.

Big cut: The number of Premium Bond prizes will fall drastically in August after becoming 'too attractive' to savers

The total prize pot this month is £57.1million. In August, this will fall to £49.3million – an almost 14 per cent cut.

The total number of prizes will fall by more than 150,000, from 1.9million to 1.75million. There will still be a £1million jackpot, but the number of winners of other prizes will dwindle.

The number of £100,000 winners will fall from five this month to three in August, while the £50,000 winners will drop from nine to six and £25,000 from 20 to 11. 

Jane Platt, Chief Executive of 
NS&I, told This is Money: ‘We agonised over the decision to reduce returns on Premium Binds. It's not something we undertook lightly.

Less chance: Those with Premium Bonds now have less chance of winning a payout in the annual prize draw

'Rates across the savings market have fallen over recent
months, resulting in NS&I savings being increasingly attractive, but it's important to note that we have not altered the terms since 2009.

'The cut to the prize fund is 20 basis points but this is far below the cuts that have been made among our private sector competitors.

‘To
ensure we stay within our Net Financing target – and in light of our 
framework to  balance  the needs of our savers, taxpayers and the 
stability of the broader financial services sector - we now need to 
reduce the Premium Bond prize fund rate.’

Instead of paying interest, Premium Bonds are entered into monthly prize draws to win prizes from £25 to £1million.

The monthly prize fund is set by calculating one month’s interest on the total value of all eligible Bonds, at the annual prize fund rate.    

NS&I sets its interest rates and the Bond prize fund rate, it says, to balance the interest of its savers, taxpayers and the stability of the broader financial services sector.

It must not make its rates or chances of winning too attractive as this would distort the market for private sector savings providers.

It sets a target each year for the total it wants to take in through deposits and Premium Bonds purchases. It has taken the decision to reduce the Premium Bond prize fund rate to stay within its Net Financing range for 2013-14.

NS&I said today that Premium Bonds had become ‘too attractive’ in the light of falling savings rates from banks and building societies.

In the first quarter of 2013-14 (April-June) NS&I attracted net £1.7billion of Premium Bond sales against a target of net £0, with a range of £2billion either side of this.

The inflows show how popular the product has become as savers struggle to find a decent return.

Interest rates have fallen over recent months in the savings sector, resulting in NS&I savings being increasingly competitive.

Lower value: The prize payouts for the Premium Bonds draw has been cut by NS&I

The reduction in the Premium Bond prize fund rate reflects current lower interest rates across the savings market, NS&I says.

Last month, NS&I announced it was reducing the interest rates on its Income Bonds, Direct Saver and Direct ISA with effect from 12 September 2013.

Cash Isa, easy-access and fixed-rate savings rates from private sector providers have all fallen in the last 12 months as a direct consequence of the Funding for Lending scheme.

This has enabled banks and building societies to tap into cheap money from the Government, rather than rely on savers.

NS&I and Premium Bonds are government-backed - and many experts will argue this is yet another attack on savers.

Despite the average return dropping from 1.5 per cent to 1.3 per cent, Premium Bonds still represent a good bet versus savings accounts.

Premium Bond returns are tax-free so, for 20 per cent taxpayers a 1.3 per cent return on Premium Bonds is equivalent to 1.62 per cent on savings, and for 40 per cent taxpayers the equivalent return rises to 2.16 per cent.

Currently, the best buy easy-access account is 1.6 per cent from Coventry Building Society, while the best two-year fix is 2.3 per cent from Kent Reliance.

Cash Isas are tax-free - and there are a number of accounts that pay over 1.3 per cent.
