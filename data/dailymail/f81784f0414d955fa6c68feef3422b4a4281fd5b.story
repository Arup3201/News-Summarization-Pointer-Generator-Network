Labour MPs have been told to stop talking about the ‘North-South’ divide in a drive to win back support.

An internal party review warned that Labour’s traditional focus on the northern working classes has alienated crucial swing voters in the South.

In an apparent change of tactics, the party will look to target the man ‘on the 6.54 from Basingstoke’, whose allegiance might be swayed as he struggles to make ends meet in the economic downturn.

The review of the party’s performance 
was overseen by former Cabinet minister John Denham and Labour general 
secretary Iain McNicol.

Mr Denham said Labour would be making a
 ‘very explicit appeal’ to the type of southern voter who helped Tony 
Blair secure his landslide victories.

A North/South divide drawn by 
researchers at Sheffield University, stretching from the Severn to the 
Humber and based on factors such as political leanings, life expectancy 
and educational prospects, showed Labour had just ten MPs in the South 
outside London after the 2010 general election, but had 210 above the 
line in the North and Scotland.

Meanwhile, Mr Denham’s report notes 
that the figure is the same as in 1992 and much lower than in 1997, when
 New Labour secured around 30 seats.

Mr Denham suggested that next year, Ed
 Miliband’s speeches would put greater emphasis on the struggles faced 
by southerners, many of whom are locked out of the property market and 
face a major squeeze on living standards.

Speaking about the North-South divide,
 he said: ‘If you think  about it, the message is that everybody in the 
southern part is doing okay.

Vision: Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured launching his 'One Nation' initiative back in September. A review under the One Nation scheme found that southern voters are being alienated by Labour

‘If you use that language, it sounds 
as though you represent the northern bit. A classic mistake for the 
party for a long time was using that sort of language, and then 
wondering why people in the South didn’t think we were talking about 
them.’

‘If someone in the Labour Party talks 
about rail fares, a southern voter may not automatically think they were
 talking about them, on the 6.54 from Basingstoke.

‘You have to make the point that you are talking about the 6.54 from Basingstoke.

‘There are towns around London where 
the average wage may be above the national average, but because the 
costs of housing and transport are so high, the living standards are 
below the national average.

Divide: Former cabinet minister John Denham, left, has said that Labour MPs have been told to avoid alienating southern voters when making speeches. Former The Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie stoked fierce north-south debate earlier this month when he called for a political party to represent the interests of the south

‘Part of what we are doing is making sure we are clearly rooting what we say with the lives of people in the South.’

Labour’s ‘Basingstoke man’ is  the latest attempt to target swing voters.

‘Essex man’ was the term coined to 
explain the popularity of Margaret Thatcher, and came to epitomise 
aspirational Tory-voters, many of whom had working-class roots but had 
sought a better life in the Home Counties.

Fresh appeal: Labour wants to concentrate its efforts to win back the southern vote. John Denham MP says that the party must appeal to the 'man on the 6.54am from Basingstoke'

Northern: Ed Miliband's constituency of Doncaster North, South Yorkshire, is above the line which splits the UK in terms of Labour support

In 1996, Tony Blair targeted the same 
type of middle-income voter, this time incarnated as ‘Mondeo man’, and 
in 2001, the Tories identified them as ‘pebble-dash people’ – 
professional married couples aged 35 to 50, living in pebble-dash homes,
 typical of the suburbs.

It comes as Mr Miliband this week pledged to unveil a string of new policies to woo middle Britain.

In his New Year’s message he said he 
had learned ‘hard truths’ about what Labour ‘got wrong’ on issues such 
as immigration in the past, and promised to focus on rebuilding the 
economy and helping  struggling families. But he will face a battle 
after a survey showed Labour MPs remain firmly opposed to curbs on 
immigration and  red tape.

The new Ipsos/Mori revealed some 49 
per cent of Labour MPs said placing any restriction on immigration would
 harm the competitiveness of Britain’s economy.

By contrast, 82 per cent of Conservative MPs said that immigration restrictions would not harm the economy.

The survey also found Labour MPs are 
deeply opposed to slashing red tape, which is cited as a major problem 
stalling the growth of small business.
