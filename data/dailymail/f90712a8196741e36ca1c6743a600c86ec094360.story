An African-American Brooklyn state senator has been forced to apologize for saying white people eat differently to black people.

Velmanette Montgomery was slamming the imminent closure of Key Food supermarket as a sign that the New York City borough is becoming gentrified.

Speaking to The Brooklyn Paper on Tuesday, Montgomery (D-Clinton Hill) said: 'Supermarkets are an important part of the community. It’s an important amenity, especially for black and brown communities.

Apology: Velmanette Montgomery said white people can shop at expensive boutiques but black people can't

'When you’re talking about a white community, it can be a little boutique, because white people don’t eat the way we do.'

The observation prompted a wave of criticism, forcing Montgomery to issue a statement of apology.

'It was an unfortunate statement and I didn’t mean to offend anyone,' she told New York’s WCBS-TV.

Montgomery claims she was trying to explain that the neighborhood's low-income families would not be able to afford produce sold in an upmarket supermarket or boutique store.

The landlord of the eight-story building which houses Key Foods said he hopes to lease the space to another supermarket after the closure in May.
