America's largest anti-sexual assault organization is slamming Maroon 5 and Adam Levine for what they are calling a 'dangerous' new music video. 

The video, for the group's new single, Animals, follows Levine, 35, as he stalks, unknowingly photographs and ultimately sexually assaults a woman as the two are covered in blood.

The woman is played by none other than Levine's real-life wife, South African-born Victoria's Secret model Behati Prinsloo.

Too far? Adam Levine and Maroon 5 are being slammed by an anti-sexual assault organization over their music video for their new single Animals

Bad premise: In the video, Levine plays a butcher who stalks, unknowingly photographs and then sexually assaults a woman

Casting couch: The woman in the video is played by Levine's wife, model Behati Prinsloo, who he married earlier this year

Yuck: The two also get covered in a whole lot of blood

'Maroon 5's video for Animals is a dangerous depiction of a stalker's fantasy — and no one should ever confuse the criminal act of stalking with romance,' Katherine Hull Fliflet, the vice president of RAINN, said in a statement.

'The trivialization of these serious crimes, like stalking, should have no place in the entertainment industry.'

RAINN, an acronym for Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, is an organization best known for operating the National Sexual Assault Hotline and carrying out programs to prevent sexual assault, help victims, and ensure that rapists are brought to justice.

Dapper dude: Levine has yet to comment on the controversy

Trouble: The Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network called the music video 'dangerous'

Creep: Levine follows the woman the entire video 

In the video, Levine, 35, plays a butcher who develops an unhealthy obsession with a female customer, played by Prinsloo.

He follows her in the streets, photographs her, breaks into her home and then lies in bed with the woman as she sleeps.

This then culminates with the two having sex in a fantasy sequence as they are both covered in blood.

More trouble: The National Sexual Violence Resource Center also slammed the video, saying Levine treats the woman like a piece of meat

Also quiet: Prinsloo has also declined to comment on the controversy

Unknowing victim: prinsloo, playing the woman, is unaware she is being followed in the video

And RAINN is not alone in voicing their concern with the message this video sends, as the National Sexual Violence Resource Center is also taking Levine to task for treating the woman in the video like a piece of meat, this according to TMZ.

Oddly enough, neither organization made any mention of the song's lyrics, which includes lines like, 'Baby, I'm preying on you tonight / Hunt you down eat you alive,' and 'Maybe you think that you can hide / I can smell your scent from miles / Just like animals.'

Neither Levine or Prinsloo have commented on the controversy. 

Survivors of sexual assault can contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1.800.656.HOPE.
