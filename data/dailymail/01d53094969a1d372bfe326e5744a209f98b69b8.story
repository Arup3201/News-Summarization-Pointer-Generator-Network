Falkland Islanders are preparing to go to the polls to decide their future - as Argentina steps up its sovereignty claims to the disputed territory.

It is thirty-one years since Britain and Argentina went to war over the Falklands, and tensions between London and Buenos Aires are running high.

That has only served to strengthen patriotic feeling among the 2,500 islanders - who are expected to vote overwhelmingly in favour of remaining a British overseas territory in Sunday's referendum.

Just 1,649 Falklands-born and long-term residents are registered to vote in the two-day referendum - with a near-unanimous 'yes' vote expected, prompting Argentina to dismiss it as a publicity stunt.

Bookmaker Ladbrokes described the result as 'the biggest certainty in political betting history' and said no one had placed a bet on a 'no' vote.

But a high turnout is expected as islanders embrace the ballot as an opportunity to make their voices heard.

'People feel strongly about this. It's our chance to make a unified stand on something that affects us deeply,' said Kerri Jamieson, a Falklands-born small business owner who has been selling commemorative referendum T-shirts.

So far she has sold about 50 T-shirts bearing the logo 'Our Islands, Our Decision,' and the orders keep coming in.

Ms Jamieson lives in a remote West Falkland settlement, where a mobile voting station will be flown in to allow the handful of residents to cast their ballots.

In the quiet island capital of Stanley, where most islanders live, the post office has produced a line of official stamps to mark the occasion.

'For the Argentines, it's just an academic exercise, but for us, it affects us enormously,' Ms Jamieson said.
