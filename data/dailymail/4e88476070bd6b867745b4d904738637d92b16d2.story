Burglars have raided the home of former world champion boxer Ricky Hatton in Manchester stealing Rolex watches, credit cards, and a wad of 500 Euro notes.

Police believe the detached property in Hyde was targeted after Mr Hatton tweeted on Saturday that he would be spending the day in London filming for Soccer AM and watching football.

Mr Hatton spent the rest of the weekend in the capital before returning home on Sunday to find a window had been broken and the property ransacked.

The thieves took two Rolex watches, a selection of credit cards, and a stack of 500 Euro notes thought to be worth a considerable sum. 

At 12.30 on Saturday he tweeted that he was going to London to film Soccer AM, before going on to watch his team Manchester City play Chelsea at Stamford Bridge that night.

Mr Hatton, who was known as 'the Hitman' during his 15-year career, is estranged from his family and moved to the house recently, meaning a burglar alarm had not been fitted.

There were workmen at the house today installing a security system. Also at the property were forensic officers from Hyde CID dusting for fingerprints.

Mr Hatton, who is now a boxing promoter, said: 'I am devastated about what’s happened. It makes you feel gutted that someone can do this to you. 

'Anyone with information should get onto the police as soon as possible because I’ve put up a reward.'
