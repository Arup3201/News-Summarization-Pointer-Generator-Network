A bombshell report released Tuesday sheds new light on why authorities in Massachusetts have named former New England Patriots star - and accused killer - Aaron Hernandez a suspect in the 2012 double-murder of two men outside a Boston night club.

The new developments - detailed in a search warrant released in Superior Court in Bristol - indicate that authorities believe that the June 17 murder of Odin Lloyd is in someway related to the double-murder of Daniel
 Abreu and Safiro Furtado, who were fatally shot outside of the Cure Lounge in Boston on July 16, 2012.

According to the warrant, police say Hernandez and friend Alexander Bradley - who later sued Hernandez, claiming that he shot him in the face last February - were at the Cure Lounge on the night of the double-murder.

Connection? Aaron Hernandez, who is accused of killing a semi-pro footballer in June, was allegedly in the same club as two men hours before they were murdered in a drive-by shooting in Boston in 2012

Also at the club that night were Abreau and Furtado.

It
 previously has been reported that Hernandez and his friends fought with
 Abreau, Furtado and their friends prior to the shooting. However, there
 is no mention of an altercation between the two groups in the recently 
released warrant, which was first obtained by the Hartford Courant.

According
 to the warrant, authorities believe Hernandez and Bradley were in a 
silver SUV that circled the block outside of the Cure Lounge, apparently
 waiting for Abreau and Furtado to leave.

When
 the men left with their friends about 2:30 a.m., the silver Toyota SUV 
pulled up next to the gray BMW were in and someone opened fire.

The warrant does not specify whether authorities think Hernandez was the trigger man.

The
 warrant explains that authorities reopened the case into the 
double-murder after a detective investigating Lloyd's death - who also 
investigated the murders of Abreau and Furtado - remembered seeing 
Hernandez at the Cure Lounge while reviewing surveillance footage from 
the club taken the night of the murders.

Additionally,
 authorities received an anonymous tip from an employee at the Rumor 
nightclub - where Hernandez and Lloyd had been seen arguing two days 
prior to Lloyd's murder - who claimed to have information indicating 
that the Lloyd murder and the double-murder at the Cure Lounge were 
related.

According to 
the warrant, Rumor security guard Sharif Hashem called the North 
Attleborough police department on June 22 - just days after Lloyd's 
murder - and said someone had 'accidentally spilled the beans' about the
 connection between the three murders in front of him.

The
 combination of the tip and the detective's recollection of seeing 
Hernandez at the club where Abreau and Furtado were murdered caused 
authorities to reopen the investigation into the double-murder.

Since
 the case has been reopened, investigators have seized the murder weapon
 in the double-homicide and Hernandez's silver Toyota SUV, which was 
towed from a home in Bristol, Connecticut owned by Hernandez's uncle.

The
 investigation also uncovered other surveillance footage from the Cure 
Lounge taken from the night of the double-murder that shows Hernandez 
and Bradley entering the club immediately after the victims.

According
 to the warrant, Hernandez had two drinks and then left 10 minutes 
later. Further, it shows Hernandez and Bradley leaving a parking garage 
near the club in the silver Toyota SUV about 1:30 a.m. - about an hour 
prior to the shooting - with Hernandez in the driver's seat and Bradley 
sitting in the front passenger seat.

It's
 unclear what Hernandez and Bradley did next, but when Abreau and 
Furtado left the club about an hour later, the silver Toyota SUV was 
seen back in the area and captured by surveillance cameras at the 
parking garage.

The SUV was then seen circling the block near the victims at a slow speed in the lane closest to the sidewalk.

At
 2:32 a.m., Boston police received a call about shots fired outside of 
the Cure Lounge. Abreau and Furtado were killed. Another man was injured
 in the shooting.

Witnesses
 told police that the vehicle from which the shooter fired was a silver 
Toyota SUV with one man driving and another in the backseat. Other 
witnesses gave descriptions of the assailants that were similar to those
 of both Hernandez and and Bradley.

Evidence recovered at the scene led authorities to believe that the weapon used was either a .38- or .357-caliber pistol.

In
 June, police found a .38-caliber pistol in the trunk of a car driven by
 Jai Lene Diaz-Ramos, who crashed the car in Springfield.

Diaz-Ramos
 reportedly told authorities some football players had been in her car 
and may have left the gun in her trunk. She currently faces three 
illegal firearm charges.

Hernandez,
 who signed a five-year, $40 million deal with the Patriots just a month
 before the alleged double-murder, has been held without bail in the 
county jail since he was charged with Lloyd's murder on June 26.

and Bradley entering the club immediately after the victims.

 to the warrant, Hernandez had two drinks and then left 10 minutes
