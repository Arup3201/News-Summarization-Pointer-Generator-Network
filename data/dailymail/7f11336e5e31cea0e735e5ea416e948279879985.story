Two unarmed U.S. B-52 bombers on a training mission flew over disputed islands in the East China Sea without informing Beijing, Pentagon officials said Tuesday.

The controversial action defies China's declaration of a new airspace defense zone in the region.

The Pentagon said the flight on Monday night did not prompt a response from China, and the White House urged Beijing to resolve its dispute with Japan over the islands diplomatically, without resorting to 'threats or inflammatory language.'

China published coordinates for an East China Sea Air Defense Identification Zone over the weekend and warned it would take 'defensive emergency measures' against aircraft that failed to identify themselves properly in the airspace.

The zone covers most of that sea and includes the skies over islands at the heart of a territorial dispute with Japan.

'The policy announced by the Chinese over the weekend is unnecessarily inflammatory,' White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in California, where President Barack Obama is traveling.

'These are the kinds of differences that should not be addressed with threats or inflammatory language, but rather can and should be resolved diplomatically,' he said.

Two U.S. B-52 bombers carried out the flight, part of a long-planned exercise, on Monday night EST, a U.S. military official said.

The lumbering bombers appeared to send a message that the United States was not trying to hide its intentions and showed that China, so far at least, was unable or unwilling to defend the zone.

The B-52s, which have been part of the Air Force fleet for more than half a century, are relatively slow compared with today's more advanced fighter jets and far easier to spot than stealth aircraft.

The dispute flared before a trip to the region by Vice President Joe Biden, who is scheduled to travel to Japan early next week and also has stops in China and South Korea. The White House announced the trip in early November.

The East China Sea territorial dispute will figure prominently on Biden's agenda.

'We
have conducted operations in the area of the Senkakus. We have 
continued to follow our normal procedures, which include not filing 
flight plans, not radioing ahead and not registering our frequencies,' 
spokesman Colonel Steve Warren said, using the Japanese name for the 
islands.

The
United States and close ally Japan have sharply criticized China's 
airspace declaration, with U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel calling it
a 'destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo in the region.'

He said on Saturday the United States would not change how it operated there.

Experts
said the Chinese move was aimed at chipping away at Tokyo's claim to 
administrative control over the area, including the tiny uninhabited 
islands known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China.

Islands: The Pentagon said the flight on Monday night did not prompt a response from China, and the White House urged Beijing to resolve its dispute with Japan over the islands in the East China Sea, pictured, diplomatically, without resorting to 'threats or inflammatory language.'

Japan's two biggest airlines - Japan Airlines and ANA Holdings - bowed to a Japanese government request to stop complying with the Chinese demands for flight plans and other information. They will stop providing the information on Wednesday, spokesmen for the carriers said.

By demanding airlines file flight plans or risk being intercepted by military jets, China is forcing them to effectively acknowledge Beijing's authority over the Air Defense Identification Zone, which is about two-thirds the size of Britain.

But in persuading ANA, JAL and other carriers to ignore the zone, Japan's Primes Minister Shinzo Abe may be calling China's bluff.

Some airlines in the region did agree to begin complying with the Chinese identification measures.

While Washington does not take a position on the sovereignty of the islands, it recognizes that Japan has administrative control over them and is therefore bound by treaty to defend Japan in the event of an armed conflict.

The Pentagon said the training exercise 'involved two aircraft flying from Guam and returning to Guam.' Warren said the U.S. military aircraft were neither observed nor contacted by Chinese aircraft.

China's Defense Ministry said on Monday it had lodged protests with the U.S. and Japanese embassies in Beijing over the criticism from Washington and Tokyo of the zone.

China also summoned Japan's ambassador, warning Tokyo to 'stop words and actions which create friction and harm regional stability,' China's Foreign Ministry said. Tokyo and Seoul summoned Chinese diplomats to protest.

In addition, China sent its sole aircraft carrier on a training mission into the South China Sea on Tuesday amid maritime disputes with the Philippines and other neighbors and tension over its airspace defense zone.

It was the first time the carrier was sent to the South China Sea.

Australia summoned China's ambassador to express concern over its imposition of the Air Defense Identification Zone over the East China Sea, the foreign minister said on Tuesday, decrying the move as unhelpful in a region beset by tension.
