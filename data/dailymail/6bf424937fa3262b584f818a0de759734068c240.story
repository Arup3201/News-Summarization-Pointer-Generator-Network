DJ Dave Lee Travis appeared in court today to face two fresh charges of indecent assault dating back to the early 1990s.

The 68-year-old was flanked by two police officers as he arrived at Westminster Magistrates' Court to be charged with two offences of indecent assault, in addition to 12 counts he already faced.

He spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth in the four-minute hearing.

Travis will next appear at Southwark Crown Court on October 21, when he is expected to enter a plea of not guilty to all 14 charges.

In court: Dave Lee Travis attended Westminster Magistrates' Court today to answer sexual assault charges

Hearing: Travis is expected to plead not guilty when he next appears in court on October 21

Travis has been accused of assaulting a woman aged over 16 between January 1, 1992 and December 31, 1993, Scotland Yard said.

The DJ, from Mentmore in Bedfordshire, 
had previously appeared in court to face 12 counts, including indecent 
assault and sexual assault.

He previously indicated he will plead not guilty to the 12 charges, which are said to have taken place between 1977 and 2007 against nine alleged victims aged between 15 and 29.

Travis, whose real name is David Patrick Griffin, did not make any comment to waiting reporters as he entered and left the court.

The ex-Radio 1 DJ, who wore a grey jacket, white shirt and cream striped tie, has denied any wrongdoing since he was first arrested on suspicion of sexual offences in November last year.

Plea: The DJ has indicated he plans to plead not guilty to the charges linked to Operation Yewtree

Allegations: Travis has been charged with a total of 14 counts of indecent assault and sexual assault

Exit: The former presenter left in a taxi following the conclusion of the four-minute court hearing

Travis was charged on August 15 as part of Operation Yewtree, the police investigation prompted by the Jimmy Savile abuse scandal, but the accusations against Travis have no connection to the disgraced television presenter.

He was charged with the two fresh counts on October 1.

At his last court appearance at the Old Bailey on September 6, Travis was released on bail on condition that he lives at home and does not contact the alleged victims.

His trial on the 14 charges is set to start on March 4 next year.

Star: Travis used to present Top of the Pops as well as his own show on Radio 1
