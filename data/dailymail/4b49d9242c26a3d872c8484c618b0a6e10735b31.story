A Home Depot worker who shot his manager before killing himself had been passed over for a promotion and was dumped by his girlfriend, law-enforcement sources have revealed.

Calvin Esdaile fatally shot his manager Moctar Sy, 38, after he was reprimanded by a supervisor at the New York City hardware store for ‘being rude’ to the man he later killed in the store’s aisle 12, according to the New York Post.

Esdaile, 31, of Brooklyn, worked a shift at the store in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan on Sunday and left, only to return to the store with a .38 caliber revolver at about 2.45pm to gun down Sy before turning the gun on himself.

Sy's sister, Kadidia Traore, told The New York Post that her brother had received a promotion over Esdaile.

She told the Post that Esdaile 'was not happy' her Sy got the position. 

The gunman’s father, Calvin Esdaile Sr. said he seemed happy when he last saw his son two weeks ago when the killer and his 6-year-old son visited the man’s St. Albans home.

His dad said Esdaile planned on buying a car and moving to Georgia with his girlfriend, Nichola Prince, 23, but later canceled his transfer application to a Georgia Home Depot, saying his girlfriend was moving to New York, the New York Post said.

Prince broke up with Esdaile instead and is now in Jamaica.

Esdaile’s father told The New York Post that his son ‘never told us anything’, and that ‘the only one that knows what happened is him’.

One of Esdaile’s former coworkers told the Post that working at Home Depot might have pushed him over the edge.

He said that Esdaile worked hard, but ‘working here must have drove him crazy’.

Witnesses of the shooting told the New York Post that they heard someone scream 'F*** you' before shots rang out around 2.40pm on Sunday.

A source told the Daily Mail Online that the shooting took place in the lighting section of the store.

They described how the suspect was chatting to one employee, saw his old boss, pulled the gun and fired.

Some of the shoppers in the store were said to be stocking up for the blizzards that have been forecast over the next few days.

A 50-year-old Bronx resident told the Daily News that he was an aisle away from where the shooting happened, and that store employees gave him an explanation for what caused the dispute.

'From what I'm hearing from employees it was a disgruntled worker who came to shoot his supervisor after he got fired,' the man told the Daily News.

Shoppers who were in the store at the time, many preparing for an expected snow storm, dove to the floor or hid behind aisles before SWAT teams led an evacuation so they could comb the scene.

A store employee told the Post that one of the victims was a co-worker who had just returned from a trip to visit his wife and child in France.

'I heard about some shots towards the back of the store. It sounded like 4 or 5 shots.

'I heard someone yell, "Oh, my God, he's dead!" It was on the main floor near the lighting department.

'What is the world coming to? This is so beyond words. Everyone was running and screaming and ducking,' the employee said.

Sigourney Rodriguez, who works nearby, was taking a cigarette break on Sunday when she saw about 100 people running out of the store. 'You hear gunshots, you're going to run,' she said.

Speaking to the press outside the store, Detective Steve Wren said Sy had been shot three times and was pronounced dead after being taken to Bellevue Hospital.

Esdaile had one gunshot wound to the head died at the scene. There were about 70 employees in the store at the time, but police confirmed that no one else was injured.

A statement issued by the force said: 'On Sunday, January 25, 2015 at approximately 1445 hours police responded to a report of shots fired inside the Home Depot located at 40 West 23rd Street, in the confines of the 13th Precinct.

'Upon arrival, police located two males shot inside the store. EMS also responded and pronounced a 31-year-old male, shot in the head, DOA at the scene.

'A 38-year-old male, shot in the abdomen and the chest, was transported by EMS to Bellevue Hospital, where he was pronounced DOA.

'A .38-cal revolver was recovered by police at the scene. An investigation is ongoing.'

Formal identities of the DOAs are pending proper family notifications.

Home Depot spokesman Stephen Holmes said the company was 'deeply saddened.'

He added: 'We are fully cooperating with the authorities on their investigation of what appears to have been an isolated incident.'
