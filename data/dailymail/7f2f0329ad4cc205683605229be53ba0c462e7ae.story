It doesn't come grander or more romantic than sleeping in a centuries-old castle. And as anticipation for a live remake of Walt Disney's Cinderella hots up, you'd be forgiven for dreaming of romantic medieval haunts, four-poster beds and huge log fires. 

One place where those dreams can come true is Bovey Castle, in Dartmoor National Park, which was built in 1906 for Viscount Hambledon, son of the business tycoon WH Smith.

The luxurious £219 per night manor has been meticulously restored to the glamour of its 1920s heyday: its 64 bedrooms and suites have period touches including carved marble fireplaces and black-and-white bathrooms with deep roll-top tubs. 

Built in 1906 for Viscount Hambledon, son of the business tycoon WH Smith, Pride of Britain hotel Bovey Castle retains its 1920s glamour

Bedrooms and suites have period touches including carved marble fireplaces and classic black-and-white bathrooms with deep roll-top tubs

Guests are offered a host of unusual country pursuits including crolf (a combination of croquet and golf), falconry and cider and sloe gin making. 

At the other end of the scale, access to mid-19th century L'Etacquerel Fort in Jersey, is across a dry moat on a high wooden bridge. 

The beautiful but simple property is found along a steep coastal path and it has stunning views over Bouley Bay. It has space for 60 people, but don't expect a bed or any self-catering facilities. 

The tower is not connected to any utilities, and local regulations insist that there should be no tents erected on site, so if you want to stay, you'll have to make do with a sleeping bag and composting toilets.
