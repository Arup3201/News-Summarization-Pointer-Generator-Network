A self-confessed former couch potato has lost seven stone in under a year and says it’s changed her life.

Claire Griffiths, 35, says she’s always been overweight, but her ever-increasing size meant she she avoided the scales out of fear.

It wasn’t until the mother-of-two went along to a weight-loss club meeting with her friend for 'moral support' that she actually found out what she weighed -  which was 19st 2lb.

'I would never have got on the scales previously,' says Claire, a customer assistant for Tesco, who lives in Hemlington, Middlesbrough with her sons Kane, 17, and Brandon, 11, and partner Jason Fysh, 43.

'Basically a friend asked me to go with her to a slimming club. I went along really thinking it was a big con.

'I thought "you have to pay someone to weigh you? It’s not going to work".'

Breakfast: Three slices of toast with thick butter, cup of tea and five chocolate digestives

Lunch: Two Greggs pasties

Dinner: Spaghetti bolognese made from jars or a take away.

Snacks/Other: Up to two bottles of wine, chocolate bars, crisps

Breakfast: A fresh fruit salad with fat free yoghurt

Lunch: Left overs from a freshly cooked meal or salad

Dinner: Freshly cooked meal such as Mexican or homemade Indian

Snacks/Other: Fruit

Claire now runs her own slimming group and says her weigh loss has changed her life

But
 despite her misgiving she was inspired to join up and within a week on 
the plan, Claire - who was a size 24-26 - had lost six and a half pounds
 and was inspired to keep on with the weight loss.

In just under a year Claire, who went to a Coulby Newham Slimming World Group, has slimmed to 12st 2lb and a dress size 12.

'I just went on from there,” says Claire, who now runs her own group in Yarm.

'And it has changed my life dramatically. I used to get in from work and plonk myself on the settee. Now I go to Zumba, go to the gym. My confidence has soared.'

Claire's aim is to eat healthily - including a lot of home-cooked meals - with the occasional treat.

'I eat loads,' says Claire, 'In fact I never stop eating. It’s just about working out the correct foods.'

She added: 'I thought I was happy before but I’m actually really happy now.

'Friends and family have been shocked but really supportive and really happy for me.

'A lot of them now comment on how well I look.

'I feel healthier too - I do things like going swimming with the boys which I never used to do.

'I used to read the magazines about people who’d lost weight and think ‘that’s not the same person’.

'But it really, really does work - as long as you stick to a plan. I’m living proof.'
