One baby boy's set to be showered in lots of pink after a sonographer guessed his sex wrong.

Kyle and Danielle Williams from Belleville, Michigan, had even picked out the name Charlee for their second daughter. But when the infant was delivered via C-section on March 3 they got a big surprise. 

After coming to terms with the wrong gender prediction, the couple filmed themselves breaking the news to family during hospital visits.

They uploaded footage  online this week in a bid to share the mix-up with the wider community. In one scene, one of the baby's grandmothers walks in to do a diaper change, when she's suddenly left speechless.

It's a boy! Kyle and Danielle Williams from Belleville, Michigan, filmed the moment they told family that they had a boy instead of a girl as an October sonogram predicted 

Are you kidding? In one scene, one of the baby's grandmothers walks in to do a diaper change, when she's suddenly left speechless

'Well child welcome to the world... I can't believe it!' she says as she stares down at the baby's naked body.

She is seen opening her mouth wide and doing a double-take. 

In the next scene, the baby's other grandmother finds out that he is boy and not a girl.

'It's a boy? You guys are not joking?' she exclaims as she stands by Mrs Williams' bedside.

Later the new mother tells her sister about the unexpected sex of her baby via Skype.

'Are you kidding! Oh my God! Oh my goodness! Yey!' the new aunt continually exclaims after putting her hand over her mouth.

The Williams' swiftly changed the name of their baby to Bentley Thomas. 

Other than the gender confusion, he was deemed well and healthy, weighing 7lbs 5oz.

'This is Bentley, your baby brother,' the Williams' later told their other daughter, Peyton, who seemed a little confused about the situation. 

'Why?' the two-year-old quipped as she was introduced to her new sibling. 

Besides having to 'de-pink'  Bentley's baby room and closet, the Williams say life couldn't be better.

Mix-up: Dr. Lisa Masterson, an OB/GYN from Los Angeles, California, told Inside Edition that getting the baby's sex wrong is more common than people think when sonograms are involved

They concluded: 'Getting to break the shocking news to our families was priceless.'

Dr. Lisa Masterson, an OB/GYN from Los Angeles, California, told Inside Edition that getting the baby's sex wrong is more common than people think when sonograms are involved.

'There are multiple things that factor into the accuracy of the ultrasound,' she explained.

'The fluid that's around the baby, because there's less fluid then everything is kind of squished up and you can't delineate all the borders. 

'The position of the baby. If the legs are crossed and you can't really see if there's a penis or not.'
