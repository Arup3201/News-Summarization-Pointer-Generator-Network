Jacob Murphy has issued an apology to Blackpool after the on loan winger's dismissive Snapchat about the club went viral on social media.

Ahead of their Boxing Day 1-0 defeat at  Championship rivals Sheffield Wednesday, Murphy snapchatted a picture with team-mate Donervon Daniels sarcastically mocking the club's plight in England's second tier.

Murphy, who started the clash at Hillsborough, accompanied the photo with the caption 'We are going to lose... Again.'

On Monday, the 19-year-old released a statement on the Tangerines' official websiteÂ apologising for his misdemeanour.

'I'd like to offer my sincerest apologies to the manager, my team-mates, the fans and everybody at Blackpool Football Club for the hurt and embarrassment that a recent photo message I sent has caused,' it read.

'It was totally unprofessional of me and a foolish thing to do.

'I have loved my time at Blackpool so far, and I've been really grateful for the support I've received.

'I know I have let the manager and fans down badly, but I aim to repay them by working even harder and helping the team climb up the league table.

'I'd also like to make clear that Donervon Daniels had no part in this and I apologise for implicating him.'

Blackpool boss Lee Clark added: 'I'm extremely disappointed because I expect nothing but total professionalism from my players.

'We will now investigate this matter internally before deciding upon an outcome.'

Earlier in the day, Daniels tried to distance himself from the Snapchat picture claiming,Â via his Twitter account, he didn't know what the photo's intended purpose was meant for.

'For the record: I do not have snapchat and I was unaware what the selfie was being used for. I appreciate the continued support from BFC,' he tweeted.

Despite his indiscretion, Murphy has impressed during his loan spell at the Seasiders from fellow Championship side Norwich City.

The midfielder has scored two goals in 10 appearances and was named as the club's player of the month for November.

The Championship's bottom side next match is away to Premier League opposition Aston Villa in the FA Cup on January 4.
