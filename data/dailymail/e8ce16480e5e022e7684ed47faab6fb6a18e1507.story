Edinson Cavani scored after just 57 seconds as Paris Saint-Germain beat Apoel Nicosia 1-0 in a scrappy game to reach the last 16 of the Champions League.

The striker's fourth goal in as many games threatened to spark a rout, but PSG ultimately flattered to deceive.

With injured striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic watching from the stands, Cavani also hit the post while Brazilian winger Lucas spurned other first-half chances.

PSG have been criticised for a lack of goals in the absence of Zlatan Ibrahimovic but it didn't take them long to remedy that

But the well-organised Cypriot side defended resolutely and PSG's performance became disjointed as the game wore on.

PSG, unbeaten so far this season, has not lost at home in European competition since Nov. 2006 and tops Group F with 10 points - one more than Barcelona, who won 2-0 away to Ajax thanks to two goals from Argentina star Lionel Messi.

Ibrahimovic is nursing a heel injury and hopes to be fit to face league leader Marseille on Sunday.

Cavani started at center forward, flanked by Ezequiel Lavezzi and Javier Pastore.

Having scored a last-gasp winner away to Apoel two weeks ago, it was the total opposite this time - with a well-taken effort signalling the Uruguay forward's return to form after some poor early-season performances.

Full back Gregory van der Wiel broke down the right and picked out Cavani just inside the penalty area. With his back to goal, he flicked the ball up, spun and hit a firm shot that goalkeeper Urko Pardo fumbled, as the ball slipped through his fingers and rolled over the line.

Apoel missed their only chance to level in the 12th minute when midfielder Nuno Morais whacked a shot high over the bar after goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu had beaten away a header from midfielder Vinicius.

After a brief spell of neat possession football from Apoel, PSG tore up the field, again exposing the visitors' weak left flank.

Pastore released Lucas after a quick one-two and, from his curling cross, Cavani rushed in to beat Pardo with a stooping header that bounced off the foot of the right post. The rebound fell to Lavezzi but, with Pastore getting in his way, he was unable to line up a shot.

Lucas saw his angled shot skim just past the left post in the 27th after midfielder Blaise Matuidi picked him out with a cross from the left, and soon after Lucas left three defenders in his wake as he burst from midfield before forcing Pardo into a low save.

Apoel looked lively at times going forward, only to lose possession too easily.

From one failed attack, Pastore carved a hole in midfield and released Matuidi, who then touched the ball on to Cavani, bearing down from the right. But Cavani hesitated, decided against shooting, and then tried rounding Pardo, only to lose his footing and go to ground.

With only 64 seconds played of the second half, Cavani almost repeated the his first-half trick but fluffed his shot from the near the penalty spot and, three minutes later, his curling effort from just inside the penalty area went wide of the upright.

Lucas then tried jinking his way to goal, but got the ball tangled up in his feet after trying to beat a third defender, and the crowd's frustration was audible when Cavani hit a shot well over after Pastore's cut-back from the right.

Pastore had the next go, albeit a difficult chance, and saw his effort saved as he tried to dink the ball over Pardo from a tight angle.

Cavani should have done much better with 10 minutes remaining, swiping a shot wide of the post from near the penalty and then substitute Jean-Christophe Bahebeck saw his shot charged down in the last minute.

Although PSG was rarely troubled, this performance was not one to send fear into Europe's other big clubs.
