A couple are celebrating the miraculous recovery of their 10 month old son after he and his twin brother were born extremely prematurely at 23 weeks.

Deborah Jackson, 32 and partner Nick Filby, 28, from Harlow, Essex, find their happiness is tainted by heartache as they grieve the tragic death of their second son.

Despite the best efforts of medical teams, baby Owen only survived an hour after his delivery, while his brother Ollie fought for his life in hospital for six months.

Alongside Deborah and Nick's joy at Ollie's recovery and homecoming, they are still grieving the tragic lost of his twin brother Owen

When Deborah, a trained nanny and Nick, a plumber, were told that she was expecting twins eight weeks into her pregnancy they were thrilled.

But at 23 weeks Deborah suffered a heavy bleed with stomach pains and a worried Nick rushed her to hospital where she was told she was in labour. 

She says: ‘I knew already it was one week before the abortion limit.

Ollie (right) and Owen (left) were born at just 23 weeks weighing 1lb 10grams and 1lb respectively

‘I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I pleaded with doctors to do everything they could for the twins as long as it wouldn’t be cruel.’

Their local hospital wasn’t specialist enough, and Deborah was transferred to a specialist premature baby unit at another hospital, an hour away.

There, they told her that her twin boys had little chance of survival and that even if they did survive they’d be severally mentally and physically handicapped. 

She says: ‘They told us to prepare for the worst, it was the most terrifying moment of our lives.’

Deborah’s labour lasted four agonising hours.

Little Owen arrived first, weighing 1lb but he was breach and badly damaged. His shoulders and back had been broken during his birth and his skin was bruised.

The second twin Ollie was born a few minutes later, just 10g bigger. 

He cried, and was taken straight off to an incubator.

Deborah says: ‘This should have been the happiest time of our lives - instead me and Nick never felt so afraid.

‘I sat up in bed holding little Owen. We sang Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to him and I held him close so he’d feel the warmth of my skin.

The family held a small service for baby Owen

‘When his body went cold after an hour and a half we knew he’d gone.

‘Afterwards I didn’t know how I could carry on.  But like Nick I knew we needed to stay strong for Ollie.’

Ollie was critically ill, suffering a brain bleed hours after birth and doctors told the couple to prepare to say goodbye.  

However miraculously Ollie survived his first few days.

Then the medical team discovered a hole in his heart and although the doctors managed to close it with medication, Ollie suffered a massive bleed on his lungs - nearly drowning him in his own blood.

Again Deborah and Nick prepared to say goodbye but Ollie fought back, again and again as he suffered a further two major bleeds.

Things looked their bleakest when he caught pneumonia and his lungs collapsed. Then he caught a stomach infection, which causes the intestines to die.

Doctors pumped his tiny body with steroids and antibiotics.

Then when his retinas started to detach he needed injections in his eyes to save his sight.

Deborah says: ‘Doctors said they were running out of options. But we’d already lost one baby, we couldn’t bare the thought of losing Ollie too.  We were living on a knife edge.

‘But despite needing 19 blood transfusions Ollie kept going. We spent every second we could by his incubator praying he’d pull through.’

In the meantime the couple had to bury their other son Owen.

Ollie was in hospital for over 6 months, recovering from several potentially fatal conditions

Deborah says: ‘We held a small service with close family. It felt like my heart was breaking as they took his tiny coffin away to be buried. ‘

After the funeral the couple were back at the hospital by Ollie’s side.

‘He’d cheated death so many times it was as though he had a guardian angel. 

‘Maybe it was his brother, there was no other explanation.

‘And the doctors couldn’t explain it.  They told us that they’d never seen anything like it.’

Although Ollie, now 10 months, still requires oxygen to assist with his breathing, his brain functions are normal and he constantly improving

For weeks Ollie battled for his life, surprising them each time they thought he couldn’t take anymore, and slowly he began to put on weight and stabilise.

Finally after six months he was allowed home, and since, he’s been going from strength to strength.

‘Deborah says: ‘He’s doing so well, he’s turned into a right little tinker and now weighs nearly a stone!

‘All his brain functions are fine now and although he still needs help with his breathing and has an oxygen canister at home, it’s constantly improving each time he goes for his check ups.

‘One day we’ll sit him down and tell him about his big brother Owen.  

‘We’re proud of him too and grateful for the brief moment we had him in our lives.’
