Well-wishers have raised £35,000 to safeguard the Cotswold landscape which inspired Laurie Lee’s classic Cider With Rosie.

The late author’s family put Trantershill Wood, in Gloucestershire’s Slad Valley, up for sale last year.

The Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust launched an appeal in January, and in just six weeks received almost 1,000 donations from all over Britain to buy the woodland.

Roger Mortlock, the trust’s chief executive officer, said: ‘We have been truly overwhelmed by the support.’

Lee’s novel, published in 1959, is set in Slad and has sold millions of copies. He became a significant local landowner after the success of his books.

Conservationists were also outraged by the sale as the wood is abundant in native flora and fauna.Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust launched an appeal in January to raise the £35,000 needed to purchase the land from the Lee family.

They received almost 1,000 donations in just six weeks from well wishers all over the UK and were able to buy the piece of literary heritage.

Mr Mortlock said: 'We knew that this was a special place and that there would be amazing support to secure it from our members.

'It's great to know that in the middle of a recession people still value this county's stunning countryside.

'The landscape that inspired the classic Cider with Rosie will be protected.'

Mr Mortlock said he was particularly thrilled as Trantershill Wood is next to the trust's existing Swift's Hill nature reserve.

Laurie Lee's book Cider With Rosie was set in the Slad Valley

Trantershill is an ancient woodland of Beech and some Yew, Wych Elm and Elder trees and contains rare orchids, a bluebell carpet and roe deer.

Laurie Lee died in 1997 aged 82 and is buried in the churchyard in Slad, opposite the village's Woolpack pub where he was a regular through his life.

He became a significant local landowner after the success of his books and was an ardent campaigner against housing development in the Slad Valley.

But his family, daughter Jessy Lee and wife Kathy - who still lives in the couple's home in Slad - put his beloved woodland on the market last year.

Jessy previously said the hard decision to sell came after a person began hacking through Trantershill with a chainsaw to allegedly cut down wood and sell it on.

She said the worry of what was happening to her father's woodland was keeping her awake at night.Jessy contacted Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust for advice and decided she wanted them to have custody of the woods.

But she was unable to donate the land as it belongs to the Laurie Lee estate and instead offered to sell it to them for the minimum offer of £35,000.

Jessy said she was delighted and relieved that the trust had been able to raise the money to buy the land.

Trantershill Wood would be 'in the best possible hands', she said.

Gloucestershire Wildlife Trust will create an entrance to Trantershill from Swift's Hill, with an official opening in the spring.

The trust also owns Frith Wood and Snow's Farm nature reserves in Slad.
