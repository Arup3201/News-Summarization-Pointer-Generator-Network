Radio Times readers have named Italy their must-visit television destination of the year based on the popularity of BBC Two programme The Trip.

The sitcom’s second series followed stars Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan as they travelled through Piedmont, Tuscany, Pisa, Rome, the Amalfi Coast and Capri – showcasing Italy’s stunning scenery and food while visiting sun-drenched vineyards and terracotta houses.

Italy was followed by Northumberland and Durham, which serves as the setting for the ITV detective crime drama Vera, starring Brenda Blethyn.

Vera featured some of the North East’s most popular locations, including Blyth, Whitley Bay, Nose’s Point and Rothbury.

The third most popular scenic backdrop of 2014 was Northern Ireland, the principal filming location for HBO’s Game of Thrones.

The drama was down two spots after finishing atop last year’s poll of Radio Times readers, who were asked to vote for the location they would most like to visit after watching their favourite television programmes in 2014.

Cornwall, the setting for BBC One’s adaption of Daphne du Maurier’s Jamaica Inn, was voted the fourth most popular destination, while Derbyshire, the shooting location for Peter Moffat’s The Village on BBC One, rounded out the top five.

The rest of the top ten (from sixth through tenth) was London (Sherlock), Malmo, Sweden (The Bridge), Liverpool (Cilla), Calgary, Canada (Fargo) and Cardiff (Doctor Who)

Jade Bremner, Radio Times Travel Editor, said: ‘The fact that British locations dominate our top ten TV settings list this year is testament to the quality of UK dramas, our home-grown production teams and our incredibly diverse, beautiful and dramatic landscapes.

‘But the number one spot is utterly deserved by Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan’s The Trip, in which they take a romantic grand-tour style romp through magnificent Mediterranean countryside, and sprinkle witty observations throughout.’
