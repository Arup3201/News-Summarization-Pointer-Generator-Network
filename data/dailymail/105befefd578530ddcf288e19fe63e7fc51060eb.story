Hard-up parents were left furious after a school asked them to fork out hundreds of pounds on iPads for lessons and homework.

Staff at Rossett School in Harrogate, North Yorkshire told children to ask their parents to buy them the £300 tablet for their work.

But the request has infuriated parents, hundreds of whom attended a showdown meeting with the headteacher over the cost.

A row has broken out at Rossett School in Harrogate, North Yorkshire after parents were asked to buy iPads for their children

One parent at the 1,400-pupil co-educational, which has academy status, said: 'This could create a two tier system.

'We can probably afford one, but not everyone can, especially if you have more than one child.

'The kids were all taken into an assembly and told about it. Straight away you are hamstrung.'

The anonymous parent said many people's concerns surrounded security, as 1,400 iPads would be carried in and out of the school on a daily basis.

'As a parent, you would do anything you can for your child,' he added.

'You don't want your child to be the only one in the class who hasn't got one.

'There is a bad taste in the mouth as this hasn't been communicated well and the school has been totally unprepared for the sort of concerns we have.'

Headteacher Pat Hunter said overall the school, which was founded in 1973, received a positive response.

She said: 'It's important to adapt to the constantly changing needs of students so they can reach their full potential.

'We understand buying an iPad is not a cheaper option, but we believe it is a very worthwhile investment.'

Expensive: An iPad2 can cost more than £300, beyond the reach of many parents at Rossett School in Harrogate

Outlining options to buy outright at a lower price or through monthly payments, the head said children who still couldn't afford to one would be able to borrow the equipment from the school.

She added: 'A lot of research had gone into the scheme.

'There will be no child that will be disadvantaged because of financial reasons.

'We have always made sure all children are given the same opportunities and this will be no exception.'

Rossett was rated as 'outstanding' by Ofsted in 2010/11.
