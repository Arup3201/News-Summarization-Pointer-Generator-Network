The attorney representing the University of Oklahoma's disgraced fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon has said he believes the members - including those who chanted racial slurs - deserve a second chance.

Stephen Jones, who represented Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, spoke at a press conference on Friday as he said he is seeking a 'non-legal' resolution with the university.

Its president, David Boren, expelled the two students filmed leading the racist chant last weekend - but Jones said that Boren himself recently said that everyone deserves a second chance.

'We certainly think that's true for the members of the SAE house,' Jones continued. 'And perhaps even for the members who were involved in this unfortunate confrontation with the university and the basic values of SAE.'

Jones is representing students and alumni from the fraternity. He is not representing the two students, Parker Rice and Levi Pettit.

He said that he hopes to reach a 'non-legal' resolution with the university, which he indicated acted hastily when it closed down the frat house on Monday. He added that he also wants to ensure the students - some of whom have received death threats - are granted their right to due process.

'I'm not ruling out a lawsuit,' he said. 'I'm saying that our preference is proceeding in a non legal solution... If that is not possible, then obviously we will have to consider other possibilities.'

Jones also pointed out that hundreds of students and fraternity members had attended the event where the footage was filmed, and that the 'inexcusable' chant was the action of just a handful.

'We're talking about one incident with nine seconds of video on one of five buses,' he said.

Also on Friday, a spokesman for the fraternity's national headquarters revealed that officials with the Oklahoma chapter have stopped communicating with them.

'We have not heard from the Oklahoma chapter,' spokesman Brandon Weghorst said. 'They have not engaged us since the time the chapter was closed.'

Weghorst said the national fraternity is moving forward with plans to expel all of the suspended members of the OU chapter, a move that will permanently revoke their membership. 

The frat house was shut down after a nine-second video recorded last weekend emerged showing members singing a song using racial slurs and referencing lynching.

'There will never be a n***** SAE' they were heard singing aboard a bus. 

The fraternity was closed immediately and all students and staff were ordered to remove their belongings from the frat house by Monday night.  

One of the alleged ringleaders, Parker Rice, said earlier this week that he has left the University of Oklahoma and is 'deeply sorry' for what he did.

'For me, this is a devastating lesson and I am seeking guidance on how I can learn from this and make sure it never happens again,' he said in a statement. 'My goal for the long-term is to be a man who has the heart and the courage to reject racism wherever I see or experience it in the future.' 

Brody and Susan Pettit, the parents of Levi Pettit, also apologized to the 'entire African American community' for their son's 'disgusting' actions.

But the family added that they had raised him to be 'inclusive,' saying: 'We know his heart, and he is not a racist.' 

An investigation into the involvement of other members is still underway.

Investigations into racism at Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapters have now extended to college campuses in Louisiana and Texas, the organization said Thursday.

It came after its national office received word that members in those places knew the racist chant caught on video in Oklahoma.

Spokesman Brandon Weghorst said the chapter at the University of Texas at Austin was being 'fully cooperative' and that a probe at Louisiana Tech in Ruston was in its early stages. He said no new allegations had been substantiated. 

'We had no idea of this type of behavior was going on underground,' Weghorst said Thursday. 'This is the type of stuff (the chant), it goes underground and it goes under the radar.

'It's dangerous because — if we don't know about it, we can't stop it.'

The president of the university's SAE had previously issued a statement denying that his chapter had ever performed a similar chant. Luke Cone said he could 'speak on the behalf of my fraternity brothers that we are all profoundly distressed' about the language in the video. 

The SAE chapter at Louisiana Tech did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Thursday, but a university spokesman said it has been unable to substantiate an allegation that a former member participated in the chant in 2010.

'Once we learned that, we immediately got with the current chapter president and the leadership of that chapter to ensure this activity wasn't taking place here at Louisiana Tech,' said spokesman Dave Guerin.

'They assured us that it wasn't. We can't really attest to back in 2010.' 

Some members of some of the largest SAE chapters in the country on Thursday denied any knowledge of the racist chant. 

'In my four years, I never have seen anything or heard anything like that in my individual chapter,' said Will Sneed, past president of the SAE chapter at the University of Arkansas. 

Meanwhile, the University of Oklahoma football team expressed its outrage Thursday in a statement calling for fraternity leaders to be 'expelled, suspended or otherwise disciplined severely'.

'As a team, we have come to a consensus that, in any organization, the leadership is responsible for the culture created, and in this case, encouraged. ... Allowing this culture to thrive goes against everything it means to be a Sooner,' the players said.
