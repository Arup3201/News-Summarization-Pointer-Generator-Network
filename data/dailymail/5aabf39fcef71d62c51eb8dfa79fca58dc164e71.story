US bobsledder Johnny Quinn has already had an eventful Olympics, and he hasn’t even competed yet.

Quinn found himself and two teammates stuck in an elevator Monday only days after breaking through a broken bathroom door in his hotel room.

His struggles with shoddy facilities at the Sochi games are not singular, other bobsled teams have also had their share of @SochiProblems as well.

Trapped again: US bobsledder Johnny Quinn found himself locked Monday morning in a jammed elevator

The unlucky Olympian and teammates Nick Cunningham David Cripps found themselves stuck in the elevator Monday morning, they documented the incident on Twitter.

‘Of course I'm with @JohnnyQuinnUSA when the elevator door breaks and we get stuck! Good thing I'm with him!’ Cunningham tweeted.

With it came a picture of Quinn comically trying to rip the doors open.

‘Now we're stuck in the elevator! Can @JohnnyQuinnUSA get us out?’ Cripps tweeted.

Quinn himself was in disbelief over the whole incident.

‘No one is going to believe this but we just got stuck in an elevator,’ he tweeted.

This is the second time Quinn has been trapped by malfunctioning doors.

A Saturday shower ended with him charging through a bathroom door after being trapped inside without a towel.

‘With no phone to call for help, I used my bobsled training to break out,’ Quinn tweeted with a picture of a destroyed door.

The picture made him famous and led to a series of interviews and television spots where he demonstrated his door crushing technique.

'At that time I was so mad and frustrated I didn’t even have a towel in there. I was just excited to finally get out of there,' he told Good Morning America.

'Once I got out of there and put a towel on, I looked back at the door and said ‘Oh man there’s a giant hole in there. I might get in trouble for this.'

Officials have not said if he will be billed for breaking the door.

The stunning image also led a few famous people to chime in.

Comedian Gilbert Gottfried tweeted him with a picture of a door he broke through years ago at the ‘Tonight Show.’

Actor William Shatner joked ‘Now no more shenanigans until you win a medal.’

British bobsledder Rebekah Wilson also had elevator difficulties in the athletes village. Her glitch came two days ago when she hit the button to go down and almost caught the express.

The doors opened and there was an empty elevator shaft.

Jamaican bobsledders also had their luggage misplaced upon arrival at Sochi.

The errors are but a few of many in what is quickly becoming the most bungled Olympics in history.
