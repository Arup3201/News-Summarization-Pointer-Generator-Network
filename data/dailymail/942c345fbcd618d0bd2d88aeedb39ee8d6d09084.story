Orphans who lost their parents when a garment factory complex collapsed in Bangladesh vented their grief and anger at leading Western retailers today on the six-month anniversary of the disaster.

Relatives of the 1,135 people who lost their lives when the Rana Plaza complex collapsed on April 24 also said they had still to receive any compensation for their loss as they rallied at the site of the tragedy.

'We lost our parents for your work: Walmart, Carrefour, Benetton ...,' read a banner held by a group of orphans, listing some of the retailers whose clothing was made at Rana Plaza before it collapsed.

Delays: Although some retailers have promised to pay into a compensation fund, activists complained that money was not reaching those in need

Although some retailers have promised to pay into a compensation fund, activists complained that money was not reaching those in need.

'If you talk about legal compensation, none of the 3,629 workers working in the Rana Plaza at the time of the disaster has been paid a single cent,' said Roy Ramesh, Bangladesh head of the IndustriALL global union, which is negotiating with retailers for compensation.

'The government donated some money from its charity fund and British retailer Primark paid 30,000 taka ($375) to each of the victims,' he said, adding factory owners and the rest of the 28 retailers who were making clothing at the Rana Plaza factories have paid nothing.

Rezaul Karim, 32, was one of the injured workers who joined the protest in front of the Rana Plaza ruins, demanding more money to treat his broken spinal cord and a monthly pension to maintain a decent life.

Tragedy: A child stands with his father, a worker who survived the collapse. A charity found that nearly two-thirds of survivors and families of those who died had not received any legal benefits from their employers

'Since the collapse, I've got only the
 30,000 taka ($375) given by Primark. I am now reduced to begging,' he 
said, clutching the hand of his eight-year-old son.

'The government has paid for some of my treatment but more treatment is needed and it'll cost a huge amount.

'My
 son cannot go to school and there are days we don't have enough food,' 
he said, adding he now depends on charity from relatives and neighbours.

A
 report by British charity ActionAid published on the anniversary also 
highlighted a failure by the authorities and the retailers to compensate
 the Rana Plaza victims and their families.

The
 charity surveyed 2,297 people - nearly two thirds of survivors and 
families of those who died - and found that 94 per cent reported they 
have not received any legal benefits from their employers since April, 
including sick pay or compensation.

Half measures: The Bangladesh government has paid some funds to 777 people - around a third of the victims and their family members - but no long-term compensation package has been agreed, a charity said

Struggling to cope: Primark, which is owned by Associated British Foods, has offered to pay long-term compensation to the victims of the disaster or their families

The Bangladesh government has paid some funds to 777 people - around a third of the victims and their family members - but no long-term compensation package has been agreed, it said.

Primark, which is owned by Associated British Foods, has offered to pay long-term compensation to the victims of the disaster or their families.

Some 550 workers at the New Wave Bottoms supplier, which was making clothes for Primark, will a be given a third payment, believed to be three months wages, while the long-term compensation is finalised.

The minimum wage in the country is £24 a month and Primark said this offer would 'alleviate immediate hardship'.

As part of the longer term deal workers will get medical and vulnerability assessments by experts at Dhaka University, independent doctors, unions and non-governmental organisations.

Disaster zone: Some 1,129 workers were killed and about 2,500 injured six months ago when the blaze tore through the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka in April

Calls for change: Campaigners have been pressing the Bangladeshi government to increase the minimum wage and improve working conditions in the country's garment industry in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster

Primark will begin paying compensation early next year.

'The company calls on other brands sourcing from Rana Plaza to now contribute a fair share of this tranche of aid,' a spokesman said.

Last month, IndustriALL called a meeting of some of the world's largest retailers in Geneva to discuss a £47.2m compensation fund for the workers injured in the disaster and the families of those who died.

Only nine brands using clothes from the factory turned up.

Primark, which is headquartered in Dublin and trades under the Penneys banner in Ireland, had a supplier on the eighth floor of the building.

It was one of 28 brands being supplied from the factory.

Other companies are said to be considering whether to follow the proposal.

Primark said it was pressing ahead with its compensation scheme because of the time it is taking to reach agreement.

It also committed to paying another three months wages to all workers or their families if the other 27 brands which used the Rana Plaza refuse to support their compensation scheme.

Primark also sent food aid to 1,300 families within a week of the building collapse.

Campaigners have been pressing the Bangladeshi government to increase the minimum wage and improve working conditions in the country's garment industry in the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster.
