That was a very impressive performance from George Ford at fly-half in his first England start and he has to ‘go again’ against Australia next week, a game England must win.

And he must play again with Owen Farrell who wasn’t quite so impressive individually but this combination must be given time to grow.

My only big regret from Saturday is that England took Farrell off midway through the second half. That didn’t make a lot of sense, they need as much game time together as possible.

Ford impressed me in many ways. Physically he immediately proved he was up to it by taking two or three big hits from the Samoans, who will undoubtedly have targeted him and would look to have tested him out physically as soon as possible.

There were a couple of nice touch finders and he did very well indeed for England’s first try running a wrap around with Farrell and then finding Mike Brown with a good pass to create the opportunity for Jonny May to show his pace and score by the posts.

Again there was an electric break on the half hour which probably should have resulted in a second England try but he possibly overcooked the pass a little and Mike Brown couldn’t cling on. Then in the second half he produced a moment of sumptuous class with his cross-field kick to Anthony Watson to create Mike Brown’s try.

England's only error of judgement was to remove Farrell midway through the second half

His goal kicking was very steady, my one constructive criticism is that given the conditions and his excellent kicking game — and indeed that of Farrell — England tried to play too much rugby too early in the first half

England should have been ‘playing’ 20-30 yards further down the pitch. Make that kicking expertise count territorially before you start ‘playing’. He was honest enough to admit his fault afterwards, now he must show the confidence to change on the hoof in the heat of battle.

With Farrell, my only real concern is that given his physicality — he loves to get involved — he is probably joining too many mauls and rucks. The big advantage of playing two footballers and playmakers in the side is that you always have the two options available.

England coach Stuart Lancaster has several selection decisions to make ahead of the South Africa clash

You don’t want one of the players tied up needlessly in the heavy forward exchanges no matter how physically able he might be.

For Australia, I would bring Dylan Hartley back at hooker and, although it’s a bit unfair on Brad Barritt, I would go with Luther Burrell at outside centre. You need that extra pace outside Farrell. I also enjoyed a lot of what Anthony Watson did, he must go again and get more game time in huge matches.

I would also bring Danny Cipriani on to the bench. If the big decision had been made to go with Ford/Farrell England need a like for like replacement at 10 if Ford gets injured.

Mike Brown’s second-half try. George Ford’s cross-field kick was a beauty, drilled hard and low to keep the hang time to a minimum so that defenders didn’t have a chance to organise themselves.

Anthony Watson did very well to latch on to the ball and even better to resist the temptation to go for glory in just his second start for England and score a try in front of 82,000 fans at Twickenham.

Watson scoring was 50-50 at best but he capped an impressive performance by showing the maturity to pass to Mike Brown, who was in a better position to make scoring a certainty. It was very classy and professional. It was also an important moment for Brown, who will have enjoyed getting back on the scoreboard.
