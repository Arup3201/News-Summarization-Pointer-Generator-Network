Banned: Brendan Quinn, 38, has been permanently struck off from the medical profession

The boss of a rehab clinic dubbed the ‘Showbiz Alcatraz’ has been kicked out of the profession over his ‘flagrant disregard’ for patient safety.

Brendan Quinn, 38, was manager of the £10,000 a week Causeway Retreat on Osea Island, Malden, Essex, which boasted Take That’s Mark Owen and the late Amy Winehouse as patients.

Channel 4 executive Sarah Mulvey, who was behind hit shows like ‘10 Years Younger’ and ‘How To Look Good Naked,’ killed herself in January 2010 after she was treated on the island.

She had self-harmed and made an attempt on her own life the day before she was told by staff to leave the retreat.

At an inquest into her death, her father, Dr Christopher Mulvey, criticised the clinic, saying: ‘There were so many opportunities at this point to help her and they were not taken.’

Advertising material for the Causeway Retreat named Quinn as one of Britain’s 250 best private doctors, even though he was not qualified, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard.

Quinn was the boss and a major shareholder of the facility’s operator, Twenty 7 Management, which rented the Edwardian manor.

The Causeway, which charged a minimum £5,000 per week, also treated actor Jonathan Rhys Meyers and members of some of Britain’s wealthiest families.

It was never registered as an independent hospital with watchdog the Care Quality Commission.

But patients with mental health problems were admitted to the unlicensed facility, the hearing was told.

The clinic did not have a doctor on site at all times and patients were adequately supervised.

Quinn also failed to tell employees they were working illegally in an unlicensed hospital.

While he was in charge medication was administered by unqualified staff without valid prescriptions and drugs were stored in a suitcase in an unlocked room.

NMC panel chairman James Spencer told him: ‘Your acts and omissions could foreseeably have caused significant harm to patients.

‘You consistently placed your own commercial needs above those of highly vulnerable patients.

‘You not only deceived the public as to your correct qualifications, by holding yourself out as a doctor, you also deceived those involved in ensuring correct registration of services as to the exact nature of the services provided at the Causeway.’

The hearing into Quinn’s management of the Causeway began in 2012 and has been adjourned at least five times, having run for more than 90 days, costing the taxpayer more than £300,000.

Announcing the decision to strike Quinn off Mr Spencer said there was no doubt his conduct had put patients at ‘unwarranted risk of harm’.

He told Quinn: ‘You allowed particularly vulnerable patients to be admitted into an unregistered and unsafe environment.

'You failed to ensure that the Causeway was capable of providing adequate and appropriate care to patients through your failure to establish and maintain appropriate arrangements for the management of medication and your failure to ensure adequate staffing levels.

‘Throughout the period of the charges, you demonstrated a flagrant disregard for patient safety.

‘The panel was also satisfied that your misconduct brought the reputation of the profession into disrepute.’

He added: ‘In all the circumstances the panel concluded that your misconduct was fundamentally incompatible with your ongoing registration.

‘It decided that the only sanction sufficient to protect the public was a striking off order. Additionally, it considered that the public’s trust and confidence in the profession, and the NMC as a regulatory body, would be significantly undermined were a striking off order not imposed in your case.’

Quinn, of Lewes, East Sussex, denied all the allegations against him, insisting former staff members had cooked up elaborate stories to ruin his reputation.

He said: ‘They have been determined to absolutely destroy my career and indeed they’ve done an absolutely superb job.

‘They have come here and they have given evidence and they’ve had regular meetings outside this process.’

He claimed he had also been bombarded with anonymous text messages from pay-as-you go phones threatening him and his family.

But the panel dismissed Quinn’s claims of an elaborate conspiracy saying it ‘lacks credibility’.

Earlier Krystal Whymet for the NMC said: ‘Quinn allowed for clients to be admitted to Causeway who were suffering from mental health matters, even when warned by the CSCI (Commission for Social Care Inspection) that this was not appropriate.

‘He did not ensure that the clients suffering from mental health matters were adequately assessed of supervised.

‘He did not ensure that patients with mental health matters were provided with adequate treatment plans or aftercare.

‘The registrant allowed a client who had suffered a stroke to be admitted to the Causeway despite not having adequate facilities for mobility restricted patients.

‘He failed to ensure that adequate arrangements were in place to prevent risks to the health and safety of clients staff and visitors.’

Quinn was cleared of a series of charges, including claims that he allowed a female client to solicit sex for cash.

Claims that he instructed a staff member to remove a client’s prosthetic leg to stop him wandering about were also found not proved.

He was also cleared of allegations that clients had access to kitchen knives and ropes and that boats bringing clients to the island were not equipped with enough life jackets.

The Causeway was shut down after an investigation and Twenty 7 Management was fined £8,000 for running an unlicensed hospital at Chelmsford Magistrates’ Court in November 2010.

District Judge David Cooper described the company as ‘atrocious’ and said ‘its standards would really shame a third world country’.

Quinn has 28 days to appeal the panel’s decision before he is struck off.
