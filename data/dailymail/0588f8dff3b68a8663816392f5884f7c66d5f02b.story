The next Mrs Jean-Christophe Novelli says she’s nifty with a knife, as her future husband, being a Michelin-starred chef, has taught her. She goes to show me and I think: ‘Oh yawn, she’s going to chop carrots.’

But no! It turns out to be much more thrilling. She’s talking about throwing knives, not dicing veg with them.

‘I’m quite good now,’ says Michelle Kennedy, a 39-year-old brunette who hails from Luton but is currently in the Austrian Alps, planning her wedding in a castle.

‘Jean taught me that it’s all in the wrist action. It started when he was chopping one day and threw the knife down on a board. He showed me how, and I got quite into it, to the point where we even put targets on a barn door at home for practice.

‘He has a portrait of himself in the kitchen and once I tried to hit it. Bingo! I took a chunk out of his face.’

Blimey. Who knew kitchen skills were so transferable? If the bottom falls out of the food industry, they could become a circus act.

Still, being able to inflict such damage is arguably useful when you’re set to marry a man famed for his way with the ladies.

Having read the newspaper cuttings as I travelled to meet the happy couple, though, I can see the attraction in taking a sharp implement to Mr Novelli: for as well as apparently being the sexiest chef on the planet, he might also qualify as the most sexist.

This, after all, was the man who said of Nigella Lawson: ‘From the back, she looks 60.’

His explanation for this is little more than him gazing at me with puppy-dog eyes (at 53, he’s filled out a bit since Hell’s Kitchen but the swoon-factor is still great), and saying he was caught out with a ‘silly little interview’.

Kennedy, 39, met Novelli in an airport where she was doing promotional work and he was catching a flight

‘I was a prat and I should have been in control of that, but it was a ridiculous thing.’

So, is he sexist? He looks appalled and says he is hurt I could think that. He can’t possibly be sexist because ‘it’s as bad as being racist’.

He says he has lots of friends who are women. Delia Smith hugged him the other day. ‘And the TV chef Rosemary Shrager is one of my best friends. I gave her her first job — would I have done that if I was sexist?’

His fiancee, being from Luton rather than Languedoc, has a less romantic approach. ‘He can be such an ****hole,’ says Michelle. ‘I did go mad with him. It was an outrageous thing to say. He was furious with Nigella because she said she preferred Italian food to French food.

‘No other French chef reacted like he did. Michel Roux didn’t go off on one. But Jean did — and in the most awful way. I said to him, “You haven’t just insulted Nigella but every woman on the planet. My sister, my mum . . .”’

But he isn’t sexist? ‘No! He just says things without thinking. Things he doesn’t even mean!’

Hmm. Novelli also tends to say things that aren’t quite true. Like they’d marry in Luton Airport, where they first met eight years ago (she was doing promotional work; he was catching a plane).

‘Oh that’s Jean making up stories,’ she says. ‘He does like to tell people things they want to hear.’

Although the pair have a home in Hertfordshire — where his cookery school is — they spend summers at their second home, an hour outside Salzburg.

Despite getting engaged seven years ago and raising a young family, the romance is still alive for the couple

Everything about them is dramatic — outwardly at least. He was part of that wave of chefs who became as famous as rock stars; their Michelin stars as shiny as gold discs. At the height of his fame, he was appearing on TV, bringing out books, running a string of restaurants and endorsing products. Voted the world’s sexiest chef, he could do no wrong.

Then, in 1999 he went bankrupt. Friend Marco Pierre White appeared brandishing a cheque book. ‘I told him to f*** off,’ he says. ‘I was too proud to take his money. He said, “Jean, do not be a prat. Tell me how much”.’

His private life has been a rollercoaster, too. Hearing his fiancee describe it is quite an eye-opener. He no longer sees his first wife, Tina, who he met when he was just 22, despite having an adult daughter, Christina, together.

Michelle Kennedy says she wasn't put off by her French fiance's  reputation as a womaniser

Their split, after she cheated on him, was acrimonious. ‘He was never at home,’ explains Michelle. ‘They were young. You can see how that wouldn’t work.’

His second marriage, in 1999 to South African model Anzelle Visser, ended in divorce in 2005. ‘They shouldn’t have married.’

Many women would run a mile from getting involved with someone with such a colourful past. And, to be fair, they are not in a rush to make the union official.

They got engaged seven years ago, and since then have had two sons — Jean, six, and Jacques, two. She says her friends groan and go ‘not again’ when she tells them they have a date: August 2016. 2016?!

‘There’s no rush,’ she says. ‘I feel we’ve been married from the first moment we set eyes on each other.’ When they first met, Michelle was determined not to be another notch on his bedpost. She took a job at his cookery school, but resolved to keep their relationship professional.

‘I thought he was incredibly handsome, and I could easily fall for him — but I wasn’t going to. I remember saying “Don’t look into his eyes, Michelle”. For six months, I didn’t.’

What was she afraid of? ‘He had a reputation. He was French, famous, you know.’ Yet he was smitten. Within six months, he’d seduced her. He took her to dinner with his friend, the late chef Keith Floyd. She knew she was in love with him when she saw him dancing in a club afterwards — badly.

‘I was already on the dance floor — and this manic figure came towards me, all arms and legs flying. It was Jean. It was so passionate. He dances like he does everything else — throws himself in.’

Michelle’s very pretty, with astonishing eyes, but regards herself as ‘nothing special’.

It took a while for her to trust him. ‘Oh yes, at the start I went through his phone messages, thinking I was going to catch him out, but I didn’t. Then I realised “he means this”. He wants a family life. He wants loyalty.’

What about the female attention he attracts, though? They can be blatant, she says, slipping numbers into his jacket pocket. She stands up and thrusts her chest out, to demonstrate what women do in front of him.

How does he deal with it? ‘He’s very good at repelling it,’ she says. ‘He’s the most loyal person I know.’ He isn’t at all aware of his looks, she says.

Jean gets all French when I ask him about fidelity. ‘It is the most important thing. If someone is unfaithful at home, you must question everything about them.’

Despite admitting to booze-fuelled rows, the couple have settled into domestic bliss

Did he and his big mate Marco ever discuss fidelity (Marco being another of the culinary world’s supposed bad boys)? He looks shocked. ‘Marco was NEVER unfaithful. Never. I know this for a fact. He’s a remarkable man.’

What’s interesting is how many parallels there were, in the early days at least, between Jean and Michelle’s fiery relationship and the one between Marco and his (now estranged) wife Mati.

Michelle says they had their fair share of huge, often booze-fuelled rows, where petty jealousies and insecurities came to the fore.

‘About two years ago, we actually changed the way we were doing things because we were drinking too much, and rowing through the drink. I’d accuse him of flirting with other women. He’d do the same. It’s destructive.’

Although he still appears on TV, Jean’s main job is now the cookery school. Neither seem to miss the restaurants. ‘Not having them — and the hours that go with them — means we have a chance of a family life,’ says Michelle.

He must miss the Michelin stars, though? ‘I am still a Michelin-starred chef,’ he says. ‘I always will be.’

What about Michelle? It now seems almost de rigeur for TV chef WAGs to launch their own career (Jools Oliver’s clothing range, Tana Ramsay’s cookery book).

It seems we shouldn’t hold our breath for the latter. ‘Oh God no, I’m a hopeless cook,’ she says. ‘

She could, though, write the definite book on How To Tame A Man. Sharp knives optional, obviously.
