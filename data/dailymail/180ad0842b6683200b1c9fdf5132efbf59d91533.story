Prosecuted: Rosie-Ann Stone has been charged with causing the death of her sister Jennie through careless driving

A 20-year-old woman crashed into another car killing the driver only to discover the victim was her sister, a court has heard.

Rosie-Ann Stone was not told until after the incident that the woman who died in the accident was her older sibling Jennie.

Jennie, a final-year student at the 
University of Lincoln’s Hull campus, was driving a Peugeot 206 
towards Bridlington when it collided with a Vauxhall Astra being
driven by her younger sister Rosie-Ann.

The car then crashed into a tree.

Jennie had just dropped her son Charlie, then aged nine, at Skipsea Primary School.

Rosie-Ann did not know her sister Jennie was on the same stretch of road when the crash happened.

The pair were driving back from Skipsea, East Yorkshire, where Rosie-Ann had been helping her sister get ready to move house.

Rosie-Ann
 is accused of failing to look in her mirror and pulling out to overtake
 when it was not safe to do so but has pleaded not guilty to a charge of
 causing death by careless driving.

Speaking
 at Bridlington Magistrates’ Court as Rosie-Ann made her first 
appearance, prosecutor Clive Jones said: ‘Issues of this type are always
 difficult to deal with, they’re always tragic with no winners, only 
losers.

‘This particular case is doubly 
tragic because there were two cars involved and the driver of the other 
car was the older sister of Rosie.

‘No doubt unknown to Rosie, her sister was also in that queue of slow-moving vehicles.’

Rosie-Ann elected to be tried by jury at Hull Crown Court and was granted unconditional bail until Thursday, September 5.

Tragic: Jennie Stone was killed in February when the car she was travelling in hit a tree. Her sister is being prosecuted for the crash and last year, her brother died in Afghanistan

She was watched from the public gallery by her parents Bob and Angie.

During
 a break in the proceedings, Rosie-Ann's father gave his daughter a 
thumbs-up and she blew him a kiss before letting out a deep sigh.

Mrs Stone, 56, has spoken of the decision to prosecute her daughter.

She said: 'Have our family not lost enough already? It is like being trapped in a bad, bad dream.'

'Even Jennie’s son Charlie knew Rosie 
was in the other car and he said to us "I don’t want anything to happen 
to you, Rosie. I don’t want you to go to court and get in trouble".

Heartbreak: Tributes to Jennie Stone were left at the scene where she died on the A165

'There
 is nothing to be achieved apart from destroying the family even more. I
 thought the CPS was human. Enough, enough, the family have suffered 
enough.'

Tragedy struck the family last year when the sisters' brother Private Gregg Stone was shot dead in Afghanistan.

Her late brother, Private Stone, of 
the 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, was shot dead as he took part
 in a mission to rescue an Afghan policeman in Helmand Province on June 3
 last year.

The young 
soldier, who had been in Afghanistan for less than a month, had been 
told in the last few days that his wife Samantha was pregnant with his 
first child.

He was shot dead as his task force successfully saved policeman Abdul Walid from insurgents who captured him at a checkpoint.

Private Gregg Thomas Stone, from the 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment, was the first of the sibling to be killed. He died in Afghanistan on Sunday June 3 2012 when trying to rescue an Afghan policeman

Tributes poured in for Pte Stone who was only deployed to the war-torn country on May 13 as part of 6 Platoon, Burma Company.

His widow at the time said: 'Gregg and I were childhood sweethearts and we met at school - he was my soulmate.

'He was a brilliant husband and a family man who loved his family. He was always the one to want to make us laugh - he always cheered everyone up.

'He was proud to be a soldier and for what he had achieved in his work. He would also want me to mention his dog Benji, who he loved to bits.'

Private Stone was the 417th member of UK forces to die since operations in Afghanistan began in October 2001.

An inquest found he had been unlawfully killed.
