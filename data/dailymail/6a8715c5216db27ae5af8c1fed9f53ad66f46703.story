On Strictly Come Dancing, competitors in the ballroom enjoy a friendly rivalry. In the real world of amateur competition, though, it seems that matters are a bit more cut-throat.

For Britain’s leading amateur ballroom dancer Kyle Taylor has had his ambitions of glory tripped up – amid rumours of skullduggery.

Mr Taylor was tipped to waltz away with the top prize at next week’s prestigious International Ballroom Dancing Championships in London. But his dreams are in tatters after the Home Office refused to grant a visa allowing his Russian partner, Polina Shklyaeva, to travel to the UK to compete with him.

Shock: Kyle Taylor and Polina Shklyaeva - ballroom dance champions are facing heartbreak after the latter was denied a visa

The rejection is believed to have come after an anonymous tip-off – rumoured to be from a rival dancer – alleging to the authorities that Miss Shklyaeva had been working illegally in the UK during her previous visits.

‘It’s completely untrue, and we are terribly, terribly disappointed,’ said Mr Taylor, 22, last night. ‘The decision seems to be based on lies. We think there have been dirty tricks involved, and have suspicions as to who is responsible. But there seems to be nothing we can do.’

Mr Taylor and Miss Shklyaeva, 20, have been representing Great Britain in international competition since 2011, under rules that allow couples with different nationalities to choose which to compete for.

They have won several titles and are regarded by the British Dance Council (BDC), the sport’s governing body, as the country’s most talented prospects for a generation.

This weekend, they were due to compete in two warm-up events in Sussex before appearing at the International Championships at the Royal Albert Hall on Thursday.

Miss Shkylaeva’s failure to secure a visa has forced them to withdraw. It also threatens to stop them competing at the biggest event in the ballroom calendar, November’s National Championships in Blackpool, where they were hoping to defend the title they won last year.

‘Thanks to this Home Office decision, Britain’s best chance of a winner at the Albert Hall has disappeared,’ said Bryan Allen, president of the BDC. ‘I find the decision incomprehensible. There are so many skivers who come to this country and are just waved through.

‘And here we have a legitimate visa application, from a British champion who has represented this country many times, a lovely person from a good family, who wants to do things by the book, and she has been refused. It makes me so disappointed in our government.’

Mr Allen and the BDC provided letters vouching for Miss Shklyaeva. They have been unable to establish why the visa was refused. 

Not happy: Kyle Taylor with the letters he has received back from the Home Office

‘It’s alleged that someone has complained about her. But we can’t find out a thing from the Home Office. They won’t discuss the case,’ he said.

Speaking from Moscow, where she is a part-time student at the Russian State University of Physical Education, Miss Shklyaeva said that her application for a sports visitor visa was supported by 30 pages of documents confirming her status as an elite athlete. ‘I have been coming to Britain regularly for two years, always playing by the rules, so am shocked by what has happened,’ she said.

‘For such an instant change in the Home Office’s opinion towards me, there has to have been false information given to them. Kyle and I have been improving dramatically, so perhaps it has left our rivals with no option but to try to take us out of competition.’

The Home Office declined to comment. But in the rejection letter to Miss Shklyaeva it said it was ‘not satisfied’ she would leave the UK  after her visit. Miss Shklyaeva described that as ‘nonsense’.

She said: ‘All I want is to represent Great Britain with Kyle, which I am very proud to do. If I am not allowed back into the country, it could be the end of my career.’
