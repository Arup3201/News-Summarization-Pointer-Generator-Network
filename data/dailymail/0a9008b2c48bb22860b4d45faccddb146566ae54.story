A small plane on a U.S. counter-drug mission crashed on Saturday in a 
remote, jungle region of northern Colombia, killing three Americans and a
Panamanian National Guardsman and seriously injuring the other two 
Americans aboard.

The Havilland Dash 8 was flying over the western Caribbean when it lost 
radio contact with the U.S.-sponsored multinational task force in Key 
West, Florida that runs drug interdiction in region, the U.S. military 
said.

Such planes typically track speedboats that smuggle cocaine from 
Colombia north into Central America and the Caribbean but U.S. Southern 
Command spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Ron Flanders said he did not have details on
the mission.

It was not immediately clear if the Americans aboard were all military 
contractors, although Southcom did say that plane was contracted by the 
U.S. government.

The twin-engine turboprop plane went down near the city of Capurgana close to the border with Panama.

The two injured Americans were rescued by Colombian soldiers and taken 
to a hospital in the capital, Bogota, Southcom said. The names of the 
Americans were withheld pending notification of next-of-kin.

Gen. Nicasio de Jesus Martinez, commander of the Colombian army's 
Brigade IV whose troops traveled to the accident scene, ruled out the 
possibility that the plane was shot down by rebels active in Colombia.

'There was no aggression, no impact,' said Martinez, adding that it was 
too soon to know if the crash was caused by mechanical failure, human 
error or the weather. Southcom also said there was no indication the 
plane was shot down.

The region where it crashed is mountainous jungle and rebels of the 
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, operate there along 
with drug traffickers.

Local farmers reported that the plane went down at about 1 a.m. in a 
rural part of the municipality of Acandi, said Mayor Gabriel Jose 
Olivares. Capurgana is in the municipality of Acandi.

Carlos Ivan Marquez, chief of Colombia's national office for disaster 
response, said the surviving Americans had injuries including multiple 
bone fractures and burns over at least 40 per cent of their bodies.

Panama's National Air Service identified the deceased Panamanian guardsman as Lt. Lloyd Nunez.

Santiago Castro, director of Colombia's Civil Aviation agency, said the 
plane wasn't civilian so he couldn't provide details about its route, 
origin or destination.

The plane was contracted to provide detection and monitoring of drug 
trafficking routes in the coastal region of Central America as part of 
Operation Martillo, Southcom said.

'We express our sympathies to the families of the deceased, and are 
particularly saddened by the loss of a Panamanian Air National 
Guardsman,' said Gen. John Kelly, commander of U.S. Southern Command. 'We also want to thank the Colombians for their outstanding rescue and 
recovery efforts.'

Operation Martillo (Hammer) is part of the $165 million, U.S.-led 
regional security initiative that focuses on the seas off Central 
America, key shipping routes for 90 percent of the cocaine headed to the
U.S. Fourteen countries participate: Belize, Canada, Colombia, Costa 
Rica, El Salvador, France, Guatemala, Honduras, the Netherlands, 
Nicaragua, Panama, Spain, United Kingdom and the United States. Chile 
has also contributed to the operation.
