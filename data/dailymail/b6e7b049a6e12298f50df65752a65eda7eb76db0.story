Premier League ace Michael Carrick has told of his sadness after a friend he played football with at school was found dead in a bin.

The Manchester United midfielder was in the same school football team as tragic Alan Green when they were at Burnside Community High School, in Wallsend, North Tyneside, together.

But whereas Carrick moved away from the area to pursue football stardom his old friend stayed in the North East.

The scene in Wallsend, North Tyneside, where the body of 32 year old Alan Green, a childhood friend of Manchester United footballer Michael Carrick, was discovered

Earlier this week Carrick tweeted: 'Sad to hear my old school team goalkeeper Alan Green died over the weekend. Far too early, only 32....'

The body of 32-year-old Mr Green was found in a bin in a back alley in the early hours of July 8.

The grim discovery was made by binmen behind the One Stop Shop on the Coast Road, North Tyneside.

The exact circumstances of Mr 
Green's death have not been established but police have said they are 
not looking for anyone else in connection with it.

It is understood that Carrick and Mr 
Green were pupils at Burnside Community High School, now Burnside 
Business and Enterprise College, during the 1990s.

Sad tweet: the dad-of-one Alan Green had become homeless weeks earlier

Carrick, 31, played at West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur before joining Manchester United in 2006.

But as he rose through the ranks to become a football ace his old school pal Mr Green fell on hard times.

It has been suggested that the dad-of-one had decided to sleep in the bin after becoming homeless from his flat weeks earlier.

A report has been prepared for the coroner and an inquest has been opened into his death.
