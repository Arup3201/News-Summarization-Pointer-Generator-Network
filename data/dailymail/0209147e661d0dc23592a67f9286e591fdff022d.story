A school where two-thirds of pupils speak English as a second language has celebrated a 100 per cent pass rate in maths and English tests for 11-year-olds.

One in three pupils at the Thomas Jones primary in Kensington and Chelsea, has Arabic as their first language and more than half are living below the poverty line.

But the 230 strong school has been judged 'outstanding' by education standards watchdog Ofsted in every aspect of education that it delivers.

Head teacher David Sellens pictured with a group of school children from Thomas Jones Primary School. It has a 100 per cent pass rate in maths and English, despite two thirds of students speaking English as a foreign language

The pupils are given a good 'early grounding in the basics' of maths and English, and encouraged to read high quality literature, such as the works of Shakespeare and Tennyson, from a young age

Headteacher David Sellens said the school's success is in part down to the fact that most of the children start in the 
nursery school at the age of three and get a good 'early grounding in the
basics' of maths and English.

He told the Independent:  'It is a very important starting point for families - particularly 
families for whom English is not their first language and where they’re 
living in challenging situations.

'We had pupils from Palestine, Ecuador, Somalia, Kosovo, Serbia and Mongolia - a wide range of countries.'

The self confessed 'fussy' head said he also insists on the best standards for his buildings and from his pupils in their manners, attire and demeanor.

He said he 'insists on pupils making eye contact with people and greeting visitors with a
handshake.'

The school is also 'big on homework' and students can find themselves with up to two hours a night.

Thomas Jones has often topped the tables with a 100 per cent record in maths and English over the past five years. 

According to Ofsted the 'personal development of many of the children is at a much lower level than that normally found when children first start (in the nursery),'.

But by the time they are ready to move on to Year One (for five-year-olds), they have 'attained expected levels for this age group and their overall achievement is exceptional.'

Some of the 'quirks' of the school see year six students donning white coats during science lessons, happily throwing themselves into the role of laboratory researchers.

In English classes they eagerly embrace the works of Shakespeare, poetry readings from Lord Tenyson and other quality literature - such as Lord of the Flies.

The school has children from Palestine, Ecuador, Somalia, Kosovo, Serbia and Mongolia and one in three have Arabic as a first language

Emma Cook, the year six teacher who steered last year's 11 year olds towards their 100 per cent success rate, said it was about boosting the children's goals.

She said: 'It's more about really giving them aspirations for the future, so during their lessons they become the scientist, or the historian. We are all striving for the best and we don't settle for anything else.'

She said the children can often be heard talking about going to university or becoming barristers or doctors as they walk around the school.

Most of the school's teachers are recruited straight from university, staying for a few years, before moving on to jobs outside London where homes are more affordable, he said.

The school is named after Thomas Jones of North Carolina - an early 19th century anti slavery crusader.  Despite his own basic education he strived to emancipate and teach his own children. 

In the words of the Ofsted report: 'This outstanding school lives up extremely well to the reputation of its namesake who always strove for equal opportunities and who had the highest aspirations for his own children.'

Pupils with English as their main language now form a minority in one in 13 schools, up from one in 25 in 1997. (stock picture)

More than one million children speak English as a second language, official figures have revealed.

A record one in six pupils at primary schools and one in eight at secondary don’t speak English at home.

Pupils with English as their main language now form a minority in one in 13 schools – up from one in 25 in 1997.

And for the first time this year, the number of non-native speakers topped one million for the first time, rising from 957,490 last year.

The figures were released as part of an official census of schools taken in January. At some schools, dozens of different languages are spoken.

A separate analysis released earlier this year showed how children who speak English as their first language are now a minority in more than 1,600 English schools.

The number of schools where fewer than half of children are native speakers has virtually doubled in 15 years.

The cost of educating a child with English as an additional language has been estimated at up to £30,000-a-year, against around £5,000-a-year for other pupils.

Punjabi is the most commonly spoken language among pupils who do not have English as a first language. Other widely-spoken languages are Urdu, Bengali, Gujarati, Somali, Polish, Arabic, Portuguese, Turkish and Tamil.
