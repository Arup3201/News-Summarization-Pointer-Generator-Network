Police in India claimed today the killing of two teenage girls allegedly raped before they were found swinging from a mango tree in India may not have been what it first seemed.

The head of police in India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where the killings took place, has said the two girls may have been the victims of honour killings.

Anand Lal Bannerjee also claimed only one of the cousins had been raped and they had in fact been strangled before their bodies were strung up on the tree.

The case has provoked national outrage in India after it emerged that police in the village of Katra initially refused to investigate the girls' murder due to their low-caste status

He added that police now believe the five men sought for their murder last month may be innocent.

Officers will investigate the victims' families, with relatives undergoing 'narco-analysis', whereby they will be interviewed under the influence of 'truth drugs'.

Three brothers have confessed to 
attacking and killing the young cousins, named Murti and Pushpa, in a 
case which has horrified India.

But in a hurriedly-called press 
conference, Bannerjee said: 'According to the postmortem report of 
the deceased, one of the girls was not raped and it appears to be a case
 of honour killing. We are probing the matter.

'We
 will conduct a lie detection test on all the accused who have been 
arrested. If needed, we will take the accused to Bangalore for the test 
and get the results.'

The crime provoked national outrage after 
it emerged that police in the village of Katra initially refused to 
investigate the girls' murder due to their low-caste status.

But the state's Chief Secretary Alok Ranjan dubbed rape as a 'trivial incident' and said the crime should not be blown out of proportions.

He said: 'Rape is a trivial incident and it should not be blown out of proportion by the media. The media should also look into the incidents where people have been falsely implicated in such cases.'

The alleged 
killers - Pappu, Awadhesh and Urvesh Yadav - are members of the dominant
 Yadav caste, to which most of the local police also belong.

Low-caste
 villagers from the community in Uttar Pradesh state have expressed 
concern that they could also be targeted in the wake of the horrifying 
attacks.

In addition to the three suspected murderers, two police officers have been arrested for allegedly ignoring the victims' parents when they reported that the girls, aged 14 and 15, had gone missing.

The girls' murder has prompted protests in New Delhi and other Indian cities, in an echo of the outpouring of grief which came when a student was raped and killed on a bus in the capital in 2012.

In their home village, poor locals described their worries that they would be vulnerable to a similar attack in the future.

Although a
 rape is reported in India every 21 minutes on average, law enforcement 
failures mean that such crimes - a symptom of pervasive sexual and caste
 oppression - are often not reported or properly investigated, human 
rights groups say.

More sex crimes have come to light in recent days.

A
 woman in a nearby district of Uttar Pradesh was gang-raped, forced to 
drink acid and strangled to death. Another was shot dead in northeast 
India while resisting attackers, media reports said.

U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has said he was 'especially appalled' by the rape and murder of the two girls.
