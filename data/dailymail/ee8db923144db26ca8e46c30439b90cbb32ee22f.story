Alvaro Negredo will be out for up to three months after breaking the fifth metatarsal in his right foot during Manchester City’s friendly with Hearts. 

The 28-year-old striker confirmed reports of his injury by posting an image of his injured foot in a protective boot but has vowed to come back 'stronger than ever'.

'I want to let you know that its going to be hard for the next few months,' he posted. 'I fractured my fifth metatarsal and will be out a few months. I will be back stronger than ever.'

Degredo's team-mate and fellow striker Edin Dzeko offered kind words of support after the extent of his injury was made public.

'Keep your head up pal,' he wrote on Twitter. 'I'm sure you'll come back stronger than ever... This team needs you.'

The Spain centre forward has recently been linked with a move back to his homeland with Atletico
 Madrid showing interest after reports he's struggled to settle into 
life in the North West of England.

However,
 the 28-year-old nicknamed 'The Beast' insists he is happy at the Etihad Stadium and 
has no desire to quit the Premier League champions.

'I don’t want to leave City,' Negredo told CityTV, 'I’m very happy and very settled here.'I
 had a difficult end to the season and that’s why there has been a lot 
of talking but I’ve been very happy here from the first day I arrived.'
