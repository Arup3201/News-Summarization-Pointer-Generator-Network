A cold blast of Arctic air sweeping across America's eastern states next week could bring the season's first snowstorm.

Coastal rain, 
inland snow and gusty winds are likely if a coastal low develops near 
the Carolinas and slides up the East Coast.

However forecasters say things could change depending on where the leading edge of the Arctic air stops.

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas: A cold blast of Arctic air sweeping across America's eastern states next week could bring the season's first snowstorm

Plan: The schedule for next week's potential storm would be Tuesday over the Ohio Valley and eastern Great Lakes, Tuesday night and Wednesday over the southern Appalachians and Thursday along the Atlantic Seaboard

AccuWeather.com reports forecasters are bracing for two other possible scenarios.

One is that the low pressure system moves out to sea, bringing some rain and snow mix to the central Appalachians with dry, cold conditions in New England.

Another possibility is that an unusually strong storm moves up the coast then backs into the Northeast, leading to heavy snow inland and rain along the I-95 corridor.

'Climatology does not favor major snow in along the I-95 corridor in mid-November,' ABC 7 New York's Chief Meteorologist Lee Goldberg said, according to AccuWeather.com.

'Snow is more likely in the higher ground north and west of the cities.'

Scenario 1: Forecasters say a coastal low which develops near the Carolinas and slides up the East Coast could bring coastal rain, inland snow and gusty winds

Scenario 2: Another possibility is that the low does not make the turn up the coast and slides out to sea instead

Meteorologists warn a nor'easter snowstorm could mean regional power outages, blocked secondary roads, coastal flooding and beach erosion from North Carolina to New Jersey, New York and New England.

If it fails to unfold, residents from Minneapolis to Boston can still expect cold conditions.

'At this point, this storm is a wait-and-see with more information coming in this weekend right up until the day of the storm or its close call,' AccuWeather.com reports.
