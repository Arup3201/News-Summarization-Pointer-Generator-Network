Royal Naval Air Service pilot William Sambrook, 22, told in his diary how German pilots helped the British in WW1

British and German airmen went to astonishing lengths to help each other in the First World War, warning each other where they were about to drop bombs and sending photographs of graves when they buried the other side's dead.

The extraordinary level of cooperation has been uncovered during research for an exhibition commemorating the conflict’s outbreak.

Diaries kept by a young pilot from Pembrokeshire reveal how camaraderie sometimes took precedence over hostilities, particularly amongst British and German pilots.

Notes taken by Royal Naval Air Service pilot William David Sambrook, 22, suggest German pilots warned their British enemies of where they were planning to drop bombs.

Posted to Coudekerque airfield near Calais in 1916, Mr Sambrook's diaries tell of almost daily bombing raids on German-held aerodromes, as well as the docks, and Zeppelin sheds at Bruges and Zeebrugge.

One day in May 1916, according to his diary, one of their number failed to return from a raid on Ostend aerodrome, and there were rumours that the missing aircraft had been picked up from the sea by a Belgian trawler.

A few days later, with still no news of the missing man, one of Mr Sambrook’s colleagues flew over the German airfield and dropped a message asking if they had information about his fate.

The British pilots received a prompt reply, also dropped from the air, confirming that the aircraft had indeed been shot down over the sea.

Sambrook wrote in his diary: 'They said attempts had been made at rescue, but when the machine was brought in,the pilot was already dead.

'He was buried with full military honours alongside two comrades at Marrakerke cemetery, Ostend. The message was accompanied by two photos of the funeral and the grave.'

The diary went on: 'There was also a message in German stating the name and place in German territory where our machines could land if they had engine trouble.'

Alan Wakefield, head of photographs at the Imperial War Museum, said such cooperation was much more common among pilots than among those fighting the war on the ground.

He said: 'I know of cases where German pilots dropped notes and photographs of a crashed aircraft and its occupant, saying they’d buried him and asking for his name so they could make a headstone,' he said.

'In one instance, a German pilot dropped a note saying he was about to bomb an airfield and suggesting that those on the ground should get out of the way'.

But he said the tip-off giving details of a safe landing place was probably no more than a German joke.

Mr Sambrook flew a Sopwith Camel plane like this - such planes shot down more than 1,200 enemy aircraft in WW1

Mr Wakefield said: 'I think it’s more likely to have been an example of German humour - they wouldn’t have expected the British to take them up on it.'

Mr Sambrook was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal for gallantry in the air in 1917.

Towards the end of the war, he went on to become one of the first pilots to engage in ‘deck flying’, taking off in Sopwith Pups and Camels from short platforms built on gun turrets on what were to be the forerunners of aircraft carriers.

He survived his time in France and, after a career working in the public health department of Westminster City Council, he returned to Pembrokeshire to live with his sister in Deerland, Llangwm.

His nephew, Richard Palmer, still lives in the same house and has kept his diaries and logbooks safe.

'He was a lovely man' said Mr Palmer.  'But he never spoke to us about his war record.'

At the outbreak of hostilities, warring nations had limited air forces which flew slow and unarmed reconnaissance planes into enemy territory.

But aerial warfare was quickly developed by both sides, initially with bombs being dropped by hand and pistols being used on occasions.

Machines guns were mounted to the front of planes as well as being fitted to observers’ platforms on two-seaters and intense battles commenced.

The German air force pioneered the use of ‘flying wings’ – large numbers of aircraft patrolling into enemy territory together.

Legendary German fighter ace Manfred Von Richtofen, aka the Red Baron, flew this Fokker Triplane

Manfred von Richtofen, the celebrated ace known as the Red Baron because of the colour of his Fokker triplane, led such ‘flying circuses’ and became a hero among German soldiers.

In Britain, the Royal Flying Corps, which was the Army’s flying service and the Royal Naval Air Service were amalgamated in 1918 to form the Royal Air Force.

By this stage of the war, advanced planes such as Bristol Fighter were flying as high as 18,000ft achieving speeds of 123mph.

In October 1918, the heaviest bomb of the war was dropped by a Handley Page at 1,650lb, an unthinkable weight at the beginning.

Right up until the end of the war, the various nations’ air forces were evenly matched, suffering similar numbers of losses.
