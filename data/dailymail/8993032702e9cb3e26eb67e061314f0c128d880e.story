West Ham United striker Carlton Cole was all smiles as he partied with stars of the NBA and music world on Thursday night.

The 31-year-old, who netted a crucial equaliser for the Hammers in their FA Cup third round win against Everton on Tuesday night, was just one of a host of high-profile sportsmen at the after party event following the  Milwaukee Bucks victory against the New York Knicks at a sold-out O2 Arena.

However, Knicks stars Tim Hardaway Jr, Amar'e Stoudemire and Carmelo Anthony refused to let the result affect the rest of their night as they partied at Club No.41 in Mayfair.
