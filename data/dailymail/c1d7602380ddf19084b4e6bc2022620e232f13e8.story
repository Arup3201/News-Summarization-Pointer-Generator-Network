Born six weeks premature on a Laidley farm in 1906, Ms Vigor defied the doctor's bleak prognosis and went on to become a champion showjumper.

'I didn't give up easily. I'm still here,' she said.

The centenarian continued to ride horses well into her 80s and has remained positive despite fracturing her hips in her 90s and surviving breast cancer at 102.

As the eldest of nine, Ms Vigor has outlived her siblings and three children.

She has 12 grandchildren, 19 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren with a fourth on the way.

An an interview with Christian aged care organisation Carinity when she was 97, Ms Vigor also credited her good genes and balanced lifestyle for her long life.

'You can only get there by eating healthily. We used to go to bed early too. We looked after our heath as much as we could,' she said.

Her birthday celebrations are a family affair, with her brother Walter Davidson turning 100 and her grandson Jason Tilse turning 39 on the same day.

Ms Vigor - almost four years younger than Australia's oldest citizen, Sydney's Vi Robbins - will also be Queensland's most experienced voter when the state goes to the polls on January 31.
