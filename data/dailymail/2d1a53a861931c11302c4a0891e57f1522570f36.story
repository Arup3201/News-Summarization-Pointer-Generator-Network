A staggering 94 per cent of Newcastle United season-ticket holders have already opted to renew ahead of the next campaign despite supporter unrest.

The club’s fans protested against owner Mike Ashley and manager Alan Pardew during the closing weeks of the season, at least two thousand of them staging a walkout in the second half of their final home match against Cardiff.

But the threat to stay away next year appears to have subsided with only six per cent of current season-ticket holders having not renewed at this early stage.

Disillusioned: Newcastle fans have been protesting to see Alan Pardew and Mike Ashley leave the club

Newcastle sell around 40,000 season tickets with a lot of members having signed up to a long-term price-freeze plan in 2011.

Sportsmail revealed on Sunday that Pardew would keep his job and that was confirmed on Monday night during a fans’ forum meeting at St James’ Park.

Supporters, 
however, remain unhappy at the level of investment in the first-team 
squad and were concerned by the seven defeats in eight which closed the 
season.

Pardew
 will meet with Ashley this week when the boss will be assured of his 
future and a transfer-strategy for the summer will be determined.
