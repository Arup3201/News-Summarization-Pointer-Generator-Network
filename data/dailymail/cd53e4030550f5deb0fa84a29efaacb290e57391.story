A woman from the seaside town of Hastings who gets £1,100 of benefits a month has labelled the government 'disgusting' for allowing people to live on that amount of money.

In the show Benefits Britain, which airs on Channel 5 tonight, a camera crews follows Debbie Merton, 46, who hasn't worked in 24 years and lives in a large council flat on the East Sussex coast. 

She doesn't reveal the disability  that allows her to receive this amount of money every month, but says that it is unlikely she will ever be able to get a job.

While Debbie has been on state handouts for several years, she reveals that as a young woman, she also struggled to find any work because of her lack of skills.  

She said: 'I tried getting other jobs before I was disabled but couldn't because I had no qualifications, it really winds me up - I get so angry.' 

She continued: 'It's bloody hard and the government  don't really give a s***, they're alright in their posh houses and eating lobster and caviar every night.'

'It's just disgusting how they expect you to live on money and support a house and support yourself.'

Another person who hits the sharp side of Debbie's tongue is the Queen. 

As Debbie has her neighbours round for dinner and several drinks, she holds court on the British monarch, saying: 'Look at the Queen, she's got Buckingham Palace and God knows how many other f****** properties.

'All her grandchildren and kids have got two, three, four different houses and we're sitting here on the poverty line, eating c**p. while THAT is sitting in her f****** palace, eating pretty, eating swan and everything. 

'It winds me up.' 

Debbie is known for being a socialite in the area and loves having friends over for home-cooked meals and a knees-up.

But her outgoing nature eventually gets the better of her and after one raucous evening too many, she receives a formal warning from her local housing association over loud noise coming from her flat.

According to the official letter, her neighbours have complained about fights in her home and loud music being played until the early hours, leading to the police having to be called at 2am.

She says: 'We did have a discussion earlier in the evening, but when the police turned up at two in the morning, we were ready for our bed.'

'We're meant to be a community at the end of the day but now I've got a final warning to get out of my flat.

'I'm definitely moving from here, I can't stand it round here. 

'If the council don't help me move, I'm prepared to go and live on the street.'  

Stacey Farrand, 28, from Hastings, who gets just £56 a week to support herself and her baby Eddie

Another person on the show is single mother Stacey Farrand, 28, from Hastings, who lives in a one-room bedsit with her son Eddie and lives off £56 a week.

Stacey is trying her best to move out of her 15 sq ft room and into a two-bedroom house, but can't afford the £800 deposit needed for a new flat. 

She was employed for several years full-time as a builder until she fell pregnant and she frequently explains to the cameras that she can't wait until she is off benefits again and in employment so that she can give her son the things he needs.

She says: 'I'd love to not be on benefits and go back to work. 

'If I had the money now, no limited money, I'd get a flat, get Eddie a decent bed, do his bedroom up and then save up to do my driving lessons.

'I need him to have a bed, a room and a bath - he hasn't even experienced a bath yet, only a sink. 

'I'm meant to provide for him. 

'I want a benefit-free, stress-free life for Eddie, I don't want him to worry about having dinner, where he's going to sleep or whether he's going to have a sheet on his bed.

'This time next year, hopefully we won't be on any benefits and we'll be in a two bedroom flat.'

Stacey buys her shopping from the out-of-date bin at her local convenience store

She is also adamant that her son Eddie won't ever rely on handouts from the state. 

She says: 'Eddie's going to be an astronaut or a judge. 

'He'll be going to full school, college and university - I want him to have everything.

'When he gets older, he'll have a career and get no benefits.'

The programme shows Stacey trying to eke out her £56 a week on food from the out-of-date bin in her local convenience store, and revealing that she once fainted  from hunger.

She said: 'I've been really hungry - I've passed out on the street before because I haven't eaten.'

Towards the end of the programme, Stacey is seen going down to the council offices to apply for a larger place for to live with her son. 

But the housing offices are unable to help and she walks away empty-handed, back to the room where she is forced to bathe her son in a sink because she doesn't have a bath.
