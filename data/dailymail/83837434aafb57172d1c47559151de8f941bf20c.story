She's famous for her relaxed approach to royal walkabouts but even the Duchess of Cornwall couldn't hide her surprise when offered a perch on a well-wisher's knee during a visit.

After bursting into fits of laughter, Camilla delicately took up Anthony Laing's offer as she took her place at the centre of a group photo with staff at the Shortbread House of Edinburgh.

Mr Laing, the business' managing director, looked thrilled by his usually close brush with royalty, as did the chuckling staff members.

Camilla was visiting the bakery as part of the annual royal tour of Scotland which kicked off yesterday with a visit to a jazz festival.

But it was the bakery trip that proved the highlight of the week so far, with Camilla cheerfully donning a white coat and hat over her pretty navy and white patterned dress for the tour.

Later, she tried on some clothes of an entirely different sort as she visited the Edinburgh International Fashion Festival sporting her favourite taupe coat and white pleated skirt.

There, she was treated to a catwalk show and inspected pieces by some of Scotland's hottest young design talent before being presented with a tiny teddy for her grandson Prince George.

She was also confronted with a set of risqué mannequins but appeared none the worse for the experience.

Charles, however, was nowhere to be seen and instead of joining the Duchess at the bakery, travelled to the Glendelvine Estate in Perthshire 
where he found himself face-to-face with a huge fluffy red squirrel.

Happily
 for the environmentalist prince, this one was a toy gifted to him as he
 was brought up to speed with efforts to save the red squirrel, an 
endangered native species.

Once
 common to the whole of the UK, the red squirrel is threatened by the 
increasing numbers of grey squirrels, with the alien species forcing the
 native reds north.

Keepers at the Glendelvine Estate have hit upon a novel solution to the problem - trapping any greys spotted on the land.

Tasty: Camilla listened intently as she was told about shortbread before being handed some to try

The
 programme, which has been underway since 2009, sees David Fraser, the 
estate's gamekeeper, trap up to 63 grey squirrels a year - with 
dramatically beneficial effects for the reds.

Later, the Prince of Wales attended a 
reception for the Scottish Wildlife Trust's 50th anniversary at Murthly 
Castle, near Perth before carrying on to Balhousie Castle for a tour of the Black Watch Regimental Museum, which reopened last year after a £3.5 million redevelopment.

Charles is Royal Colonel of the Black Watch, 3rd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, as well as patron of the Black Watch Royal Highland Regiment Association and of the Black Watch Heritage Appeal.

The
 visits to the Shortbread House and Glendelvine are part of a week of 
Scottish engagements for the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, 
who are known as the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay north of the border.

Later this week, the royal couple will meet athletes preparing to take part in the Commonwealth Games before joining the Queen for the opening ceremony on Thursday night.
