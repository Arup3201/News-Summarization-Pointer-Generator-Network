Ken Clarke, a minister in the Cabinet Office, claimed the cost of paying for an 11p ruler on his expenses

A cabinet minister claimed the cost of paying for an 11p ruler on his taxpayer-funded expenses, it emerged last night.

Ken Clarke, a minister in the Cabinet Office, charged for the item among several other items of stationery used by his office.

The 11p ruler claim was published in the latest release of MPs’ expenses claims. He also claimed for a pack of pens costing £21.73, and a pack of adhesive notes for £14.27.

The figures also showed that Prime Minister David Cameron claimed for a glue stick costing £4.68 and a box of paperclips costing 8p, and printer cartridges costing £133.57.

Vince Cable, the Business Secretary, claimed 43p for a pair of scissors. Justice minister Shailesh Vara found a pair for 24p.

The details emerged in the figures for expenses claims made in February and March of this year and released by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, which processes and monitors MPs’ expenses.

Overall, some 32,000 claims were made with a total value of £3.6million.

They included costs of accommodation, train and car travel and office costs. 

Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham claimed £1.74 for Blu-Tac and £2.07 for milk.

Around 800 of the 32,000 claims were filed for items costing less than £1.

IPSA rules allow MPs to claim for small items needed to perform their Parliamentary functions, such as running their offices and corresponding with constituents.

The Prime Minister, who earns £142,500 a year, raised eyebrows in Westminster by putting in a 7p expenses claim for a bulldog clip in January, even though processing the claim will have cost four times as much as its value. He also claimed 26p for ‘banner bar tags’, and 38p for a staple remover.

In April Tory MP Sarah Wollaston called for expenses to be scrapped, describing them as ‘dirty great albatrosses around our necks’.
