And the bride wore very little: Pauline Bailey is an adult TV star and glamour model

For the five-star hotel that didn’t want to host her wedding, this bride-to-be was apparently the wrong type of person.

But Pauline Bailey does have her fans. Ten thousand, to be exact. They tune into Red Light Central TV to watch her posing, pouting and parading in a series of skimpy outfits.

And the blushing bride-to-be doesn’t blush at all, despite the fact that she is wearing hardly anything.

Yesterday it emerged that the 
27-year-old medical law graduate, who described  herself as 
‘respectable, middle-class and well-educated’, is also an adult TV star 
 and glamour model who goes by the name of Rachel T.

That was a small detail that the 
wedding planner at Stoke Park Hotel didn’t know when she branded Miss 
Bailey and her fiance Paul Carty, 51, ‘not our type of people’ in an 
email to her boss after they inquired about holding their wedding there.

Unfortunately, she also accidentally  forwarded the email to an outraged  Miss Bailey.

In yesterday’s Mail Miss Bailey told 
of how upset she had been. ‘The suggestion was that we were 
undesirables, which we definitely are not. We are thoroughly decent 
people,’ she said.

What she didn’t mention was that she 
and Mr Carty are also regulars at Red Light Central TV, where viewers 
pay up £1.53 a minute for ‘adult chats’ with glamour models. They divide
 their time between  hotels in Bristol, to be close to the Red Light 
Central studio, and their semi-detached home in Luton.

Last night Miss Bailey defended her job, adding: ‘I’m not looking to draw too much attention to that really.

‘I’ve been a part-time model for five 
years now. I did it part-time when I graduated for my masters and then 
it was going too well to give up and I continued doing it. It was just 
financially viable to continue. Paul’s fine with it and I come home to 
him every night.’

Miss Bailey’s online TV profile 
states: ‘Stunning Rachel’s favourite memory is too rude to mention and 
her greatest vice is sex. She would most like to be stuck in a lift with
 He-Man.’

Her fan page on Facebook shows her in a variety of revealing outfits, including a leather dress and a school uniform.

Miss Bailey, who has been a glamour model for five years, was snubbed by the hotel's wedding planner who said she and her fiance were 'not the type of people they would want at Stoke Park'

Red Light Central TV owner Phil Barry 
confirmed that the couple worked for him. Mr Carty, a MoD-approved engnieer apparently produces 
the segments Miss Bailey stars in.

Mr Barry said: ‘They work well as a couple and generally I put them together. Pauline has a massive fan base.

‘I would estimate that she has around 10,000-plus followers. She’s a highly valued member of staff.’  

The couple claimed to have met five 
years ago on a night out with friends, however, former associates said 
they met on a set while they worked for another adult channel, Babe 
World.

Former glamour model Debbie Fisher 
claimed she had been in a long-term relationship with Mr Carty until 
just over a year ago. She said they broke up after it emerged that he 
was having an affair with Miss Bailey. Mr Carty was not available last 
night to comment on these claims.

The couple had hoped to have a £10,000
 wedding for 30 guests at Stoke Park in Buckinghamshire, which has 
featured in two Bond movies.

Discussions over booking a date 
followed with wedding planner Michele Connelly in April. But her true 
feelings about the couple were revealed in an embarrassing email to her 
manager Carlo Zoccali, which was also forwarded to Miss Bailey. It read:
 ‘I need your advice on this wedding, I know this probably doesn’t sound
 very nice, but I am trying to put this wedding off as I don’t think 
they are the type of people that we would want to have at Stoke Park.’

The hotel has since apologised and 
said it would be happy to host the wedding after all.  Last night, after
 the couple’s backgrounds became a little clearer, Stoke Park said it 
would still be glad to have them. A spokesman said: ‘We are still happy 
to welcome back Miss Bailey and Mr Carty.’ But the couple are to marry 
in June at another venue. And they are said to be seeking the advice of 
lawyers over their treatment.

Miss Bailey - pictured at work for Red Light Central TV -  has been described as 'the loveliest girl of the highest 
order' by her employer, who cannot understand why the hotel turned the 
law graduate down
