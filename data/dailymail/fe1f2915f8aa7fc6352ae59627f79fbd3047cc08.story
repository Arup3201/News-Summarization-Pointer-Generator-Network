Whisper it, but it seems the unthinkable is happening. We’re on course for a fine bank holiday weekend.

Well... mostly. Some areas could bask in temperatures hotter than Mediterranean sun spots, with highs of 19C (66F) putting  us on a par with Majorca and Barcelona  and making it warmer than Madrid and Monte Carlo.

But it’s not an entirely sunny outlook. Forecasters warned yesterday that there will be a north-south divide, with those in the north advised to keep an umbrella within their reach as rain arrives and keeps temperatures down to a more modest 16C (61F).

Still, according to the Met Office, most of Britain will see dry and bright conditions over the course of the break, with forecaster Sarah Holland saying any showers should be light and will clear throughout the weekend. She added: ‘Temperatures will reach above average for this time of year. There may be some light winds, but for most people the bank holiday won’t be too bad at all.’

Today in the north, be prepared for a touch of frost in the morning and cloud, rain and light winds throughout the rest of the day.

Further south, temperatures will rise to a balmy 18C (64F) in London and the south-east and it will be a dry, warm day.

Tomorrow, a yellow weather warning has been issued for western Scotland, with 60mm of rain predicted. In the south, meanwhile, temperatures will reach 19C (66F) – milder than the average for this time of year, though not as warm as the hottest day of the year so far on April 25, when the mercury hit 23C.

Sunday and Monday could see temperatures staying as high as 18C (64.4F) in the south, but they are likely to languish in the mid-teens in the north.

In Monte Carlo, temperatures are set to remain as low as 16C (61F), with 18C (64F) predicted in Gibraltar, Majorca and Madrid over the weekend.

Mr Lee said the outlook for Thursday 
and Friday will remain pleasant although from tomorrow a weather front 
will hang over Scotland while many other parts of the country will be 
dry.

Yellow weather warnings have been issued for some areas of Scotland on Friday, including Strathclyde, Tayside and Fife.

The forecast followed average April 
temperatures of 6.2C - the coldest since April 1989's 5.5C - and initial 
predictions of cool Bank Holiday temperatures.

Across the country festivals have 
started to mark May Day, or Beltane. Later, more traditional English 
rites will take place including the crowning of May Queens with celebrations around a Maypole.

Morris men around the country danced their traditional jog this summer to welcome the sun and to keep it coming back.

In Birmingham,
the Jockey Morris men paid their first visit to the highest point in 
Britain's second city, Lickey Hills Country Park to 'dance in the dawn'.

Road, the rosettes are from the Sutton Rose motif and the Blue Baldricks
are from the colour associated with Birmingham.

if Morris Men do not complete this ritual, then the summer won't come.

Also in Oxford, students braved freezing temperatures to welcome May Day but were thwarted in their efforts to jump off the city bridge.

Around 4,000 people flocked to 
Oxford's Magdalen Bridge for the springtime celebrations, but teenagers 
were blocked from making drunken daredevil leaps by burly security 
guards.

Morris dancing was first recorded in England in the early 16th Century and there are now participants all over the world with 150 groups in the U.S. alone.

The English folk dance, which is often accompanied by music, is suffering in its land of birth, however, owing to a lack of youngsters taking up the tradition.

Further setbacks have included a snub at this summer's Olympics after Morris dancing was overlooked for the opening ceremony.

Practitioners of the centuries-old tradition have pledged to make their presence felt still by organising spontaneous displays or 'flash mobs' at the games.

Today, for the third year running the bridge was open but barriers had been placed along it to deter any potential jumpers from climbing onto the parapets of the centuries-old bridge and throwing themselves into the water below.

A small number of over excited revellers who did attempt to jump from the bridge into the shallow murky waters below were foiled by security guards.

The celebrations are expected to continue throughout the day as Morris dancers and other groups take to the city streets to mark the day with performances and song.

In Edinburgh, Scotland, thousands of people gathered to watch the colourful Beltane Fire Festival, that kicked off last night and lasted into the morning.

The
event celebrates the ending of winter and is a revival of the ancient 
Celtic and Pagan festival of Beltane, the Gaelic name for the month of 
May.

Since its modern beginnings in the 1980s, the festival, which includes a torchlight procession, drummers and acrobats, has grown to involve about 300 performers.

People also gathered to watch the sun rise as they join in a Beltane dawn celebration service in front of St Michael's Tower on Glastonbury Tor.

Although more synonymous with 
International Workers' Day, or Labour Day, May Day or Beltane is 
celebrated by druids and pagans as the beginning of summer and the 
chance to celebrate the coming of the season of warmth and light.
