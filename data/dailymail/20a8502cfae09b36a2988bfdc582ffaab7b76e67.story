Thanks to the poetry of John Betjeman and its famous association with comedy series The Office, Slough has been struggling with an image problem for decades.

The poet called for bombs to rain down on the town - which he deemed no longer fit for humans - in verse in 1975, and the Berkshire borough was famously employed as the drab suburban backdrop to Ricky Gervais' hit satire.

Now local council staff have been banned from wearing strapless tops and flip flops in the latest effort to shake up the town's image.

Under Slough Borough Council's new dress code, women have been 
banned from 'over exposing' their bodies in revealing outfits to avoid 
embarassing their colleagues and tarnishing the image of their town.

Female employees will have to consign sheer blouses and strapless tops to the 
back of their wardrobes after councillors unanimously agreed the new 
dress code.

The new rules -
which also ban shorts and flip flops in the office - were drawn up by 
Slough Borough Council bosses following complaints from department 
managers, who claimed 'inappropriate' outfits being sported by staff as 
presenting a negative image of the town.

The authority said council staff must avoid wearing clothes that 'may cause embarassment through being revealing or over-exposing parts of the body'.

Employees who wear trainers to the office, or tops with political logos, slogans or inappropriate images, will also risk disciplinary action.

The council said it had been 'finding it difficult to encourage some staff to dress appropriately', including employees in front-line roles.

'Concerns were raised about the possible negative image presented of Slough by the appearance of some staff,' a spokesman said.

The council has said the new code will be 'reasonably flexible', and that it will be taking a common sense approach to enforcing the guidelines in light of different service areas within the authority.
