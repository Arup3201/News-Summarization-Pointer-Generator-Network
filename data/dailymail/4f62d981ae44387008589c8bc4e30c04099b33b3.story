After Steven Taylor became the latest in a long line of defenders who have suffered in the line of duty, we look at the top ten nastiest knocks that will make you think twice about appearing in your local team's rearguard this coming weekend.

Footballers have a reputation of being overly pampered, well accustomed to feigning injury, and not being keen on the physicality of yesteryear.

However, fortunately on rare occasions, we are all reminded of the dangers of professional sport, and we are forced to reevaluate our perceptions, with the disturbing images of Taylor's clash with a post against Newcastle at St James' Park prime example.

In no particular order, we look at the ten of the worst injuries defenders have suffered down the years to help remember the sacrifices some our our idols have made.

Terry Butcher, England v Sweden, September 1989

Terry Butcher after his heroics against Sweden in a 1990 World Cup qualifier - one of football's iconic images

It is one of the most iconic images of our time, and whenever a player's bravery or extra effort for the cause is mentioned, it immediately evokes memories of Terry Butcher's blood-soaked England shirt after an heroic display against Sweden in 1989.

The match is question was pivotal to England and boss Bobby Robson. The Three Lions needed a draw to qualify for the 1990 World Cup in Italy, but the plucky Scandinavians represented tough opposition.

However, predominantly thanks to Butcher's solid display, despite suffering a nasty head wound that needed heavy bandaging and changed the colour of his jersey a darker shade of red, England held out for a 0-0 draw, and all of our memories of Gazza crying, David Platt's late, late equaliser and more penalty heartache at Italia 90 exist as a result. 

John Terry, Chelsea v Arsenal, Carling Cup Final, February 2007

John Terry is stretchered off after a sickening injury in the 2007 Carling Cup final against Arsenal

Literally the definition of putting your neck on the line, John Terry did his utmost to keep the scores level in the 2007 Carling Cup final as the ball dropped in Chelsea's penalty area, but as he flung his head in the way of Abou Diaby's boot, the Arsenal midfielder followed through and caught Terry on the side of the head.

That is obviously dangerous territory for any sportsman, but luckily enough, despite being employed by the opposition, Arsenal physio Gary Lewin rushed to the Chelsea skipper's aid, and, it was later revealed, helped clear Terry's windpipe which had become blocked.

The sickening images of Terry slipping out of consciousness were stark reminder of what can happen in the blink of an eye.

Phil Babb, Liverpool v Chelsea, October 1998

Former Liverpool defender Phil Babb was the victim of one of the most eye-watering injuries in history

For the male population of this country, this is the injury that hits home the most, and the clip still proves difficult to watch in its entirety even to this day.

Hurtling in at break-neck speed as Chelsea's Pierluigi Casiraghi rounded Liverpool goalkeeper David James and fired the ball goalward, Babb was just too late.

However, as the net bulged, Babb's slide was halted only by the post, with a leg either side, and the eye-watering images still resonate today. 

Gary Mabbutt, Tottenham v Wimbledon, November 1993 

Gary Mabbutt had to wear this protective mask after being elbowed by John Fashanu in 1993

Strikers in the 1990's loved to throw their arms in the face of defenders in their backs, before referees began clamping down on such brutality.

John 'Fash the Bash' Fashanu loved leaving the flailing elbow in more than most, but his attack on Tottenham captain Gary Mabbutt in Spurs' clash with the artist formerly known as Wimbledon bordered on assault.

Fashanu's swing of his right arm actually fractured Mabbutt's skull, and meant the Spurs skipper had to wear this protective mask for several weeks.

Gareth Southgate, Newcastle v Middlesbrough, April 2005 

Somehow Middlesbrough captain Gareth Southgate managed to carry on after this injury against Newcastle

The Mail on Sunday revealed rugby’s fears over concussion earlier this year.

Lewis Moody, World Cup winner and former England captain,  launched The Mail on Sunday’s campaign for action over the alarming rise of concussion in rugby.

If you have experience of concussion in a rugby match, let us know by emailing campaign@mailonsunday.co.uk. 

A lesser-known injury, but one that sticks on the memory of Tyne-Tees derby clashes from Middlesbrough's time in the Premier League.

Against an attacking Newcastle side, the visitors were under the cosh right from the word go, but skipper Gareth Southgate lead by example, and kept the Magpies at bay.

The determined centre-back took a nasty knock to the head, but was determined to carry on, and Southgate was patched up and helped his team secure a 0-0 stalemate.

 

Martin Skrtel, Liverpool v Arsenal, December 2014

Martin Skrtel released this picture of the staples he needed following connection with Olivier Giroud's boot

Made more impressive after heading a late equaliser despite being bandaged up, Martin Skrtel had to have staples in his wound after being trodden on against Arsenal at Anfield.

The Slovakian looked to be in trouble after being caught by Olivier Giroud's boot, but soldiered on and grabbed the headlines.

Skrtel also required staples in a head wound in January 2014 following a clash with Bournemouth's Andrew Surman during an FA Cup tie.

Jonathan Woodgate, Hull v Tottenham, February 2009 

Jonathan Woodgate suffers yet another injury and misses out on a cup final after this knock against Hull

Notoriously unlucky with injuries, Jonathan Woodgate's jinx struck again as he was ruled out of Tottenham's Carling Cup final clash with Manchester United after picking up this head injury.

Woodgate's collision with his own team-mate Vedran Corluka ended with the former England defender leaving the field and needing stitches.

But once again, Woodgate missed another key game as the head injury kept him out of the final five days later.

Pepe, Real Madrid v Valencia, August 2012 

Nasty images of Pepe's head injury made their way around social media in Spain, generating much support

Another example of team-mates clashing, Portuguese defender Pepe came off worse from an aerial collision with Real Madrid goalkeeper Iker Casillas in Los Blancos' clash with Valencia, and ended up spending the night in hospital.

The images were broadcast around Spain, and caused several colleagues to offer their support.

Barcelona defender Gerard Pique was one of those stars to send their well wishes, tweeting: 'I just saw the images on TV. They are chilling. Hopefully it's nothing serious and that you will play soon! #BestwishesPepe.'

Javier Mascherano, Argentina v The Netherlands, World Cup semi-final, July 2014 

Javier Mascherano was the victim of several tough tackles against The Netherlands in Brazil World Cup

The World Cup produced several encounters rife with physicality, but Javier Mascherano's treatment at the hands of the The Netherlands in July's World Cup semi-final stands out.

One particular clash led to the fearless centre-back collapsing to the ground, with images of team-mates and the Argentina coaching staff's panic exemplifying the seriousness of the injury.

Thankfully, Mascherano made a full recovery after a long delay, but the whole episode was proof even the toughest of competitors are not immune.

Steven Taylor, Newcastle v Sunderland, December 2014

Steven Taylor's sickening injury caused a long delay in Sunday's Tyne-Wear derby at St James' Park

The reason the issue of head injuries has come to the fore once again, Steven Taylor's clash with the post at St James' Park proved difficult to watch for all involved.

One of the toughest characters around, Taylor couldn't avoid running head-on into the post, with the noise on impact one of the most difficult aspects for those close by to deal with.

Luckily, Taylor managed to get to his feet, but the scars will take some healing after such a nasty injury.
