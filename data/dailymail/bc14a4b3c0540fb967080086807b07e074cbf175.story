Costa Rica's goalkeeping hero Keylor Navas has revealed he knew which way to dive to save Greece's Theofanis Gekas crucial penalty - as the pair used to play together.

Navas, who put in an extraordinary display to keep Greece at bay in the last-16 clash, made the save before Michael Umana hit home the decisive spot-kick to set up a mouthwatering quarter-final against Holland.

Watching fans may have been petrified during the shootout, but Navas insists he knew how to save from Gekas.

'We played together at Levante and I remembered what he used to do in training,' he told FIFA's official website.

'I was confident he wasn’t going to change the way he takes his penalties, and in the end I was able to keep it out.'

Navas also revealed the words his side exchanged before the nailbiting shootout.

He said: 'We got together in the centre of the pitch and had a chat.

'The message was that we’d worked so hard to get that far, and we were convinced we could win.

'I think everyone felt that deep down in their hearts and that’s why we got there in the end.

'There are no secrets. There are 25 of us, including the two guys who are injured but are here with us. We play from the bottom of our hearts, for our country. We’ve always wanted to make history and you could see that here.'

Premier League fans could be hearing a lot more from Navas, whose £6.5million clause from Levante has alerted Liverpool and Arsenal to a potential summer move.
