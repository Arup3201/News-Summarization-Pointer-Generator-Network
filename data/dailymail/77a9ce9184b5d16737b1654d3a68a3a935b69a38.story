British shoppers have fallen out of love with the big name supermarkets, cutting their spending and switching to cheaper rivals, a new study reveals.

Since the start of this year total spending in supermarkets has been flat, after a decade of rising prices fuelling strong growth.

It comes as Tesco reported a catastrophic slump in pre-tax profits, down 91 per cent in six months, as large retailers struggle to compete with the emergence of discount stores like Aldi and Tesco.

While the amount people in Britain buy has risen steadily this year, the quantity of goods bought in supermarkets has remained flat

The Office for National Statistics today published new research on spending in ‘‘non-specialised food stores’, which are dominated by supermarkets.

It found that rapid growth in the amount shoppers spent in supermarkets over several years came to an abrupt halt at the end of 2013.

Since then there has been almost no change in the amount of money rung through supermarket tills.

By contrast, spending across the retails sector, covering every kind of shop, has risen steadily.

The amount of shopping in the nation’s trolleys has also remained unchanged. Figures the quantity of supermarket purchases has been flat throughout the decade.

Supermarkets have seen a greater increase in the amount spent, but a smaller one in quantity bought.

However supermarket prices have actually fallen in 2014.

The ONS said: ‘One cause of this may be increased price competition amongst supermarkets, caused by an increasing market share for discount supermarket chains and discounting.

‘Another suggested cause could be the falling cost of food production, resulting from falling wheat prices.

‘Regardless, it is clear that the change in pattern in supermarket spending reflects a clear change in pricing environment; demand has been essentially flat for significantly longer than spending.’

Total spending in supermarkets has also remained flat, as shoppers switch to cheaper alternatives

Millions of customers have switched to budget chains like Aldi and Lidl or high-end Waitrose and Marks and Spencer.

Tesco, which was once king of the supermarkets, is now in crisis after failing to deliver on price, service or quality.

Chairman Sir Richard Broadbent quit this morning after the most disastrous six months in the supermarket's 95-year history.

Britain's biggest retailer said its pre-tax profits in the six months to August have plunged 91.9 per cent to £112million, compared to £1.3billion a year earlier.

However, other parts of the high street are also struggling. Latest retail figures released today show retail sales fell last month as unseasonably warm weather meant that shoppers delayed buying new coats and jumpers.

Store sales volumes fell by 0.3 per cent in September compared to the month before, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The worst performers last month came from clothing, textile and footwear sales which fell 7.8 per cent compared to August, and 4.1 per cent over the year.

But taken over a 12-month period sales volumes rose 2.7 per cent in September, the 18th consecutive month of year-on-year growth, the longest sustained period of expansion since May 2008.

The ONS added that average store prices fell by 1.4 per cent compared to last year, the largest fall since July 2009.

The biggest drivers were petrol price cuts, which were down 5.4 per cent over the year, while the ongoing supermarket price war saw prices fall 0.3 per cent, the biggest drop since December 2004.

Overall retail sales volumes rose just 0.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the third quarter of the year, down markedly from growth of 1.5 per cent quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter.

Many economists believe that the moderation in consumer spending in the third quarter will contribute to a slowing in gross domestic product (GDP).

IHS Global Insight chief UK economist Howard Archer said: "It does look like consumers have reined in their spending to some degree after splashing out at a strong rate overall through the first half of the year.

"This is not that surprising given the overall pressure coming on consumers' purchasing power from prolonged very weak earnings growth."
