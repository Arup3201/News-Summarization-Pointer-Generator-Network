Tens of thousands of protesters converged on the nation's major cities Saturday to protest police violence against black men Michael Brown and Eric Garner.

Huge crowds - at least 25,000 in New York City - took to the streets chanting slogans and waving signs. Comparable numbers were observed in Washington, D.C., while other major demonstrations hit Chicago, Boston and cities in California.

The incensed crowd were joined by the relatives of black people shot dead, mainly by white police officers. In Washington, Michael Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden and Eric Garner's widow, Esaw Garner, attended.

Proceedings were mainly peaceful, but two NYPD officers were injured in a confrontation on the Brooklyn Bridge after thousands of protesters stopped traffic.

Capital: In Washington, D.C., organizers estimated that 25,000 also took to the streets - though local police do not give estimates

Chicago: In Illinois' biggest city there were also sizable demonstrations

Also among the crowd were Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, who was shot by George Zimmerman in Florida, and Samaria Rice, who 12-year-old son was gunned down by police in Cleveland, Ohio, last month. 

Waving signs reading 'Black Lives Matter' and 'Who do you protect? Who do you serve', the crowd gathered in Washington D.C.'s Freedom Plaza, before marching down iconic Pennsylvania Avenue.

They chanted the same words, 'Black lives matter', as they made their way to the U.S. Capitol to call for an end to apparent racial profiling by police. Loud music blasted from a stage set up for the rally.

Killed: The protesters held up photographs of people killed by police - which they termed murder - as they marched through Chicago

Rallying cry: Many activists have taken up the dying words of Eric Garner - killed with an alleged chokehold - as a protest slogan, seen above on t-shirts of Chicago protesters

Shouting out: The activists shouted slogans and waved placards in sympathy with crowds on the other side of the country

The 'Justice for All' march, organized by civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton, brought together thousands of supporters of two black men: Michael Brown, 18, and 43-year-old Eric Garner.

Estimates of crowd sizes were not all clear, but CBS reported that New York City numbers exceeded 25,000 - but led to no arrests. Police in Washington do not give public estimates of crowd sizes, but organizers said that 25,000 marched there as well.

In Boston, Chicago, Colorado and Oakland, California, large crowds could also be seen - making the total likely to be well in excess of 50,000.

By afternoon the NYPD had reported no arrests in relation to the protest, but photographs did emerge of a smashed-up patrol car.

Some Boston protesters were arrested, but those demonstrations were also largely peaceful.

Brown was shot and killed by officer Darren Wilson while unarmed in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9, while Garner died when officer Daniel Pantaleo put him in an apparent chokehold in Staten Island.

In both cases, grand juries declined to indict the white officers involved. 

During the march, Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, and Garner's widow, Esaw Garner, were joined by Sybrina Fulton, the mother of Trayvon Martin, and Samaria Rice, the mother of Tamir Rice.

Martin, a 17-year-old African American, was shot dead by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, in Florida in 2012, while Rice was gunned down by Cleveland police last month. 

Mrs Garner, whose husband died in July, told protesters: 'Let's keep it strong, long and meaningful.'

At one point, the rally was interrupted briefly by more than a dozen protesters who took the stage with a bullhorn. They announced that they were from Ferguson and demanded to speak.

Raising their arms up: At one point, the rally was interrupted briefly by more than a dozen protesters who took the stage with a bullhorn. They announced that they were from Ferguson and demanded to speak

Protesters hold signs referring to witness accounts that Brown had his hands raised in the air when he was shot dead by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, on August 9 - something that has been disputed

Large numbers of protesters on the ground supported the group, some chanting, 'Let them speak.'

Ultimately, organizers allowed Johnetta Elzie of St. Louis to address the crowd. 'This movement was started by the young people,' she said. The group, mostly in their 20s, then left the stage.

Organizers called the interruption unnecessarily divisive. But some in the Missouri group said they were disappointed and found the rally staid and ineffective.

'I thought there was going to be actions, not a show. This is a show,' Elzie said.

Sharpton addressed the interruption and told the crowd, 'Don't let no provocateurs get you out of line. ... We are not here to play big shot. We are here to win.'

Making a statement: Over the past few months, politicians and others have talked about the need for better police training, body cameras and changes in the grand jury process to restore faith in the legal system

Then, block after block of tightly packed people moved through the city.

Protests - some violent - have occurred around the nation since grand juries last month declined to indict the officers involved  in the deaths of Brown and Garner.

The latter gasped 'I can't breathe' while being arrested for allegedly selling loose, untaxed cigarettes  in Staten Island. Some protesters held signs and wore shirts reading: 'I can't breathe.'

Over the past few months, politicians and others have talked about the need for better police training, body cameras and changes in the grand jury process to restore faith in the legal system.

Terry Baisden, 52, of Baltimore said she is 'hopeful change is coming' and that the movement is not part of a fleeting flash of anger.

She said she hasn't protested before but felt compelled to because 'changes in action, changes in belief, happen in numbers.'

Meanwhile, Murry Edwards said he made the trip to Washington from St. Louis because he wants to make sure the momentum from the movement in Ferguson reaches a national stage.

'This is the national march,' Edwards said. 'We have to get behind the national movement.'

Sheryce Holloway, a recent graduate from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, attended a smaller gathering outside Robert F. Kennedy Stadium in Washington ahead of the main rally. She said she also has been participating in protests at her alma mater.

Holloway said the goal of the protests is 'ending blue-on-black crime. Black lives do matter.'

Saturday's march is sponsored in part by the National Action Network, the Urban League and the NAACP. 

At the Capitol, speakers will outline a legislative agenda they want Congress to pursue in relation to police killings.

While protesters rally in Washington, other groups including Ferguson Action will be conducting similar 'Day of Resistance' movements all around the country.

A large march is planned in New York City.
