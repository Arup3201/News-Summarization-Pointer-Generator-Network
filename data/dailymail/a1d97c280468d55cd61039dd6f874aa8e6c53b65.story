Bostonians whose smart phones are in need of a little juice must look no further than their closest public park.

The city and its partners at MIT announced Friday the debut of Soofa, the solar-powered bench with a USB port to charge your cell phone in green spaces across Beantown.

After all, reasons Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, 'your cell phone doesn’t just make phone calls, why should our benches just be seats?'

Soofa: Two park goers chat on one of Boston's new solar-powered, cell-phone charging park benches. The Soofas debuted in green spaces across the city starting June 27

According to a city press release, the benches will debut over the course of a week in locations that include Titus Sparrow Park in the South End, the Boston Common, and the Rose Kennedy Greenway.

The benches are the second such smart seats in the city. A previous partnership between the MIT Media Lab, its spin-off firm Changing Environments and the city itself was a similar but smaller device called Seat-e.

'We’re delighted to continue the Greenway's partnership with New Urban Mechanics and the MIT Media Lab,' said Jesse Brackenbury, Executive Director of the Rose Kennedy Greenway Conservancy. 'The Soofa will allow visitors and their phones to enjoy the sun on the Greenway.'

The forward-thinking benches feature two USB ports and a solar panel. Users will have to provide their own charging cords.

Residents are encouraged to go online and recommend a location at bit.ly/bosbench  or tweet the location to @newurbanmechs by July 11.

In addition, the designers at Changing Environments are asking Bostonians to submit ideas for names of the Soofas in each park by July 11 through Twitter to @mysoofa or via the website, soofa.co.

The winners will be invited to visit designers at the MIT Media Lab and see where it all started.
