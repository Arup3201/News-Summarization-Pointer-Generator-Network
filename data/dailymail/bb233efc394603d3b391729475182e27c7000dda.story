Scientists have started the long job of removing the encrustation from the hull of Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley.

When they are finished in about a year, they hope to have the clues as to why the hand-cranked Hunley sank after becoming the first sub in history to sink an enemy warship.

For more than three months, the sub has been in a conservation tank in North Charleston soaking in chemicals to help loosen the hard sand, sediment and rust clinging to the sub.

Taking shape: Scientists have started removing encrustation from the Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley

Quite a task: Conservator Liisa Nasanen gets to work at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center in North Charleston, South Carolina

Time-consuming: After the submarine sat in a chemical bath for more than three months to help loosen the encrustation, scientists began the laborious job of removing the built-up sediment by hand

Conservators on Tuesday started using tools similar to those of a dentist to gently remove the encrustation.

The Hunley sank off Charleston in 1864
 after sinking the Union blockade ship Housatonic.

The sub was raised in
 2000 and brought to the lab.

Long-running mystery: The work is expected to take between eight months and a year and scientists hope that when the hull is revealed, it will provide the final clues as to why the hand-cranked sub, the first in history to sink an enemy warship, sank off South Carolina in 1864
