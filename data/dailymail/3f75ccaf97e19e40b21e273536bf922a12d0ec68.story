Mario Balotelli is being investigated by police over claims he threatened his mother's neighbours for taking pictures of his Ferrari.

Greater Manchester Police are looking into Balotelli's alleged use of 'threatening behaviour' after the forward demanded the 'frightened and speechless' woman - whose mother used to cook the player bacon and eggs - stop taking photographs of the £240,000 car he shipped from Italy during the summer.

Police were called to a housing estate at 3pm on Thursday in the Wythenshawe area of Manchester, where the 24-year-old was reportedly visiting his mum Rose Barwuah.

And the victim of the incident told the Manchester Evening News that Balotelli came and looked through their front window before remonstrating in her direction for allegedly taking pictures of his car.

The woman, who asked not to be named, was visiting her mother at the time and said the former City striker left her ‘frightened and speechless’ by the incident.

'I hadn’t even taken any pictures. He came and looked through the front window. He was wearing a black beanie hat and he gave me a bit of a fright,' she said.

'Then when I came to the door he was getting right near me and pointing in my face saying, "You took pictures of my car" and I kept telling him "I didn’t, I didn’t".

'Then he said, "If you do anything with them, I’ll come back, I’m warning you", which to me was a direct threat. I don’t care who he is, I won’t be threatened like that by anyone. He’s a big guy and it was very frightening.'

The woman’s mum added: 'When he was at City he’d come round all the time and sit with us, so for him to be so nasty is a shock.

'We used to cook him eggs, bacon and tomato and now he treats us like this. It’s not on.'

It is understood a woman claimed that Balotelli moved towards her daughter, who was taking a photograph of the red sports car.

A spokesman for GMP said: 'We are investigating a report of threatening behaviour. Officers will be speaking to all concerned in due course.'

Liverpool Football Club said they would not be commenting until all the facts had been established.

The incident came the day after Balotelli was caught swapping shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe at half time during Liverpool’s 3-0 defeat in the Champions League at Anfield.
