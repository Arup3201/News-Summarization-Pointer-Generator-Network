Thousands of Jordanian troops have been deployed to the country's border with Iraq to stop Islamic State militants from infilatrating the country, it has been reported.

The country has already carried out airstrikes on ISIS targets in revenge for the murder of Jordanian pilot Moaz al Kasasbeh, who was burned alive in a cage as masked militants in camouflage uniforms looked on.

After a video was released showing the death of the airman, Jordan's King Abdullah vowed to wage a harsh war against the terror group and in a statement, he pledged to hit the militants 'hard in the very centre of their strongholds'.

Now two Jordanian government officials have told NBC News that thousands of troops have been moved to the Iraqi border in a bid to ramp up the campaign against ISIS.

The sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also added that soldiers were being sent there as a 'show of force.'

Earlier this week, the Jordanian air force unleashed three consecutive days of attacks on ISIS targets with the strikes - dubbed Operation Martyr Moaz in the pilot's memory - targeting the terror group's weapon depots, training centres, warehouses and military barracks.

The focus of Jordan's airstrikes are reported to be Raqqa, the ISIS stronghold in Syria.

The intensified air assaults come almost one week after the extremists released the chilling footage of the airman's death, which sparked protests throughout Jordan.

Entitled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', the 22-minute film showed the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit and being seemingly doused in fuel, as a trail of petrol leading up to the iron bars of the cage is set alight.

Officials believe Kasasbeh had been killed almost one month earlier, despite ISIS attempting to carry out a prisoner exchange in return for the stricken pilot.

After the footage was released, Jordanian officials promised to retaliate harshly and quickly executed two Iraqi militants connected with ISIS.

This included Sajida al-Rishawi, the female would-be suicide bomber whose freedom ISIS had originally demanded in exchange for releasing Kasasbeh.

King Abdullah II later said Jordan's response would 'be harsh because this terrorist organisation is not only fighting us, but also fighting Islam and its pure values.'

In a statement, he pledged to hit the militants 'hard in the very centre of their strongholds'.

ISIS seized control of large areas of Iraq and Syria last year, prompting hundreds of raids by coalition war planes.

The United States and several Arab allies, including Jordan, have been striking ISIS in Syria since September 23.

Warplanes from the U.S. and other countries have been waging an air campaign against the extremists in Iraq for even longer.

The campaign aims to push back the jihadi organisation after it took large parts of Iraq and Syria and declared a 'caliphate.'
