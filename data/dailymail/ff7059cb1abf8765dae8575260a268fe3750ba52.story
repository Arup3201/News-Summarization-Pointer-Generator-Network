The aunt of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un died from a stroke during an impassioned argument about her husband's execution, a defector from the secretive nation has revealed.

Kim Kyung Hui, 68, was the sister of Kim's late father Kim Jong II and perhaps the most prominent figure in the oppressive regime. 

She was a close aide to her own brother Kim Jong-il for decades, assuming senior positions in the party and becoming a four-star general in 2010

But her husband, Jang Song Thaek, was executed in December, reportedly by a firing squad.

According to Kang Myung-do, a defector who was son-in-law to North Korea's ex-Prime Minister, Kang Sun San, Ms Kim was on the phone to her nephew arguing about the execution when she had the stroke. She was hospitalised and died later. 

The death was not announced as the government did not want people to link her death to her husband's, who had been labelled 'despicable human scum, worse than a dog'. 

Ms Kim was frequently seen at the side of her nephew and his wife at public events until January this year, when her last public appearance was in the documentary shown on North Korean Central TV.

In that footage, aired in January, she was seen walking with the leader and his wife towards the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun in the capital, Pyongyang, to pay tribute to the embalmed bodies of former leaders Kil Il-sung and Kim Jong-il. 

The Kim family has ruled the reclusive, impoverished state for more than six decades with an iron fist and a pervasive personality cult. 

Before his execution, Jang was viewed as an integral figure in his rise - but he was killed in brutal fashion

Kim Kyong Hui, who is often the only female face on official photographs of ranks of generals and party leaders, was tasked with transforming her nephew into a figurehead with a reputation for strong military tactics who is able to handle an international crisis.

Jang Song Thaek and Kim Kyong Hui met at university and married in 1972.

Kim Kyong Hui reportedly had a stroke after a row with her nephew regarding the execution of her husband, Jang Song Thaek 

They have no surviving children, according to the South Korean government-run Information Centre on North Korea - their only child, a daughter, committed suicide in 2006 at the age of 29 while studying in Paris, according to South Korean media.

While Ms Kim disappeared from public view for six years after 2003, she re-emerged to a more powerful role, being made a four-star general in 2010.

She also owns the only burger restaurant in Pyongyang, where the menu offers 'minced meat and bread' rather than using the American word 'burger'.

Despite her perceived protection as a direct descendant of nation founder Kim Il-sung, Ms Kim was associated with her husband who was publicly denounced as a traitor and executed in December. 

Jang, the leader's uncle, was considered instrumental in his rise to power. 

Before his brutal killing, he was described as the second-most powerful figure in North Korea. 

But Kim Jong Un turned his back on Jang in spectacular fashion last year, having him executed on charges of trying to overthrow the government. 

The North's official Korean Central News Agency indicated that Jang saw the death of Kim's father, Kim Jong Il, in December 2011 as an opportunity to challenge his nephew and win power.

Prior to his execution, North Korea accused Jang of corruption, womanizing, gambling and taking drugs, and said he'd been 'eliminated' from all his posts.

In even more serious allegations, he was then linked to a claim that he tried 'to overthrow the state by all sorts of intrigues and despicable methods with a wild ambition to grab the supreme power of our party and state'.

Kim Jong-un went on to describe the execution of his 67-year-old uncle as the removal of 'factionalist filth', in his New Year message, adding that his purge left North Korea in a much stronger position. 

After his execution, direct family members were said to have been shot dead and other relatives were sentenced to labor camps.

Among those killed, reportedly on Kim Jong-un's orders, were North Korea's ambassadors to Cuba and Malaysia.

Days after the execution, Jang's wife suffered her third stroke and died later. 

It contradicts Korean media reports she committed suicide five days after her husband's execution.  

North Korea watchers have speculated that Kim Jong Un's younger sister Kim Yo-jong, believed to be 26, may now end up playing the same leadership supporting role as her powerful aunt. 

This week, North Korea's official KCNA news agency listed her as a 'vice department director' in the powerful central committee of the ruling Workers' Party.

She was pictured accompanying her brother on a trip to a cartoon film studio founded by their grandfather and the North's founding president, Kim Il-Sung.
