Between soaring expectations and a flood of gimmicks, Valentine’s Day can be a costly affair.

If you’ve used up all your funds on a glamorous present for your main squeeze, don’t fret: a fast food store on the south-coast of NSW is offering a Valentine’s meal that doesn't dent your wallet.

Warilla McDonald's will host the frugally-romantic dinner option - the only store around the country offering the service - which will see black tie waiters serving the standard menu with crockery and glassware. They're even taking reservations.

The restaurant is offering the standard menu on crockery, as well as treating diners to candles, romantic music and tables adorned with roses

The restaurant has vowed it will be a ‘genuinely romantic dining experience’, with patrons treated to candles, romantic tunes and tables adorned with red roses.

Warilla store manager Michelle Steain told Daily Mail Australia the promotion has garnered an overwhelming response.

‘We've had about 60 reservations so far and the phone is running hot,’ she said. 

The restaurant has taken bookings from all walks of life, from young families to teens to elderly couples.

‘We were initially appealing to young families, but it has really taken flight. We’re getting reservations from as far as Terrigal, which is several hours away,’ said Steain.

Warilla is the only store in Australia to offer the service, after coming up with the idea several years ago.

‘We first ran the promotion back in 2013, and it was covered by media around the world. Last year, stores in America and Britain took a page from our book and offered the same service.’ 

The service has met with some disapproval on social media, with some taking the restaurant to task.

Brendan J Leach wrote on Facebook: 'How much of a cheapskate can you be to take your date to maccas for a romantic date. Trust maccas to try and profit from it.'

Diane Brown said: 'No no no no no! Pure Bogan! Fish and chips on the beach is better!' 

The restaurant manager has vowed it will be a ‘genuinely romantic dining experience’

When asked to outline what diners can expect, Steain said it will be a ‘genuinely romantic dining experience.’

‘Expect candles, flowers and smooth FM Love Song dedications to set the mood. The prices are the same as normal, so you would be pressed to find a cheaper option for a romantic Valentine's dinner.' 

You can book the Warilla Mcdonald's Valentine’s Day service, which is running on Saturday until 9.30pm, on (02) 4297 3641
