Prosecutors have asked for strict security for a Massachusetts teenager charged with killing his teacher after he allegedly attacked a female youth worker this month.

In court papers released Thursday at the request of The Salem News, Essex County prosecutors said 15-year-old Philip Chism slipped away from caregivers before the June 2 incident at a the Metropolitan Detention Center in Boston.

Prosecutor Kate MacDougall said Chism crept along a common hallway 'crouched down out of view,' followed the woman to a locker room and tried to choke her while holding a pencil. Other workers came to the woman's aid when she screamed.

Alleged assault: Chism attacked a youth worker at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Boston, say prosecutors

Chism is at Worcester State Hospital for evaluation, and prosecutors have expressed concerns about security at the facility, reports the Salem News.

Chism pleaded not guilty to robbing, raping and killing 24-year-old Danvers High School teacher Colleen Ritzer after following her into a restroom last October.

A 15-year-old accused of brutally raping and murdering his teacher last year has attacked a female guard at his youth facility, it has been reported.

'The 
Department of Youth Services is working closely with law enforcement to 
investigate an assault that took place on a member of the staff at our 
Dorchester facility,' Alec Loftus, Department of Youth Services, told WCVB, which first reported the assault.

Authorities
 still don't know what motivated the transfer student 
from Clarksville, Tenneessee to kill his teacher.

He has pleaded not guilty to aggravated rape, robbery and murder in the death of Ritzer, whose body was found in the woods near Danvers High School in October.

Her throat was slit and a note reading, 'I hate you all' was found at the scene.

Chism,
 who had been asked to stay late by Ritzer to help after school, 
allegedly followed her into a bathroom on October 22 and attacked her, 
sexually assaulted her twice, stripped her and then stole her cellphone,
 credit cars and her driver's licenses.

According
 to investigators, her body was then placed in a recycling bin and 
carted away to a wooded area behind the school and dumped.

Dumping the violent assault on Ritzer, Chism, who was then just 14, allegedly raped her twice - once with a stick.

After
 dumping her body, prosecutors say Chism returned to school barefoot 
where he changed into his soccer clothes and threw away his bloodied 
school clothes.

He then went to eat a burger at Wendy's and caught a screening of Woody Allen film 'Blue Jasmine'.

Police
 arrested him later that evening when he was found walking down a busy 
highway. He had a bloody box-cutter in his pocket along with Ritzer's 
underwear.

Last month, Ritzer's parents Tom and Peggie Ritzer issued a video statement speaking about their loss while also thanking the community for their support. 

'These 
past six months have been a period of great pain and sorrow for our 
family and all those who knew and loved Colleen,' mother Peggie said.

'Each
 day presents new challenges but we are blessed by the support of family
 and friends. Through the many acts of genuine kindness to honor our 
daughter and sister, our spirits are lifted. Though difficult, we strive
 to follow Colleen's words to find good in every day.'

Mental health: Chism's mental state is being evaluated at the Worcester State Hospital

In the video, Mr Ritzer thanked everyone for turning out to raise money in Colleen's name.

'Thank
 you for your kind words, generous gestures and support of the 
scholarship fund in Colleen’s name that will empower future generations 
of thoughtful, caring teachers to emulate Colleen’s passion to inspire 
students to discover their full potential,' Mr Rtizer said, flanked by 
Mrs Ritzer and Colleen's sister Laura and brother Tom.

Following
 his arrest, classmates and teachers at the school expressed shock that 
such a quiet and polite boy could commit such a horrendous crime.

Chism's
 mother Diana - who is separated from father Stacey - said her son was 
'born in love' and that she is 'struggling to understand' the murder.
