Fall from glory? Last year's number one store, Apple, has plummeted to 13th place due to 'bad service'

Apple may be the darling of the tech geeks but ordinary shoppers have fallen out of love with the US giant.

The chain’s high street outlets have dropped from first place to 13th in a league of the nation’s favourite retailers compiled by the consumer champions at Which?

Its stores look beautiful and minimalist with glossy white walls and tables, where the sleek and stylish iPads, iPhones, iPods and MacBooks are displayed like precious pieces of jewellery.

Staff float around serenely, full of American ‘have a nice day’ bonhomie, and are happy to help customers to spend £500 plus on the company’s latest piece of tech wizardry.

But woe betide the poor individual who doesn’t know their FaceTime App from their Safari browser – for getting help can be extremely frustrating.

People who want help in setting up, fixing or understanding the operation of their device can go to the store’s so-called ‘genius bar’, where Apple’s experts can work their magic.

However, forget simply rolling up when on a shopping trip into town, for these ‘geniuses’ are often so busy that it can take days to get an appointment.

The fact that so many people are waiting for help raises a question as to whether Apple’s devices are as simple and intuitive to use as the company and its British design chief, Sir Jonathan Ive, claim.

Many tech industry experts have made the point that smart phones are actually far too smart, given that most people hardly ever use all the myriad of functions and Apps that are built in.

It is this very complexity which confuses consumers and sends them to the Apple geniuses for advice.

Which? said: ‘Last year’s winner Apple slipped down to 13th place after seeing nine per cent slashed off their customer score. Several customers complained about it being difficult to book an appointment with its ‘genius bar’ service, which helps consumers with technical problems.’

The research suggests that Apple’s new
 highly paid head of retail Angela Ahrendts, who started work on May 1, 
has a bigger job than she might have expected.

Miss
 Ahrendts, who has been given a golden hello of shares worth around 
£40million, was previously head of the luxury British fashion label 
Burberry, where she was one of the UK’s highest paid women executives.

Top of the high street poll this year is the natural beauty products chain Lush, where staff were praised for their personal service, ahead of the Disney Store, Richer Sounds, John Lewis and Waterstones.

For the second year in a row bottom place went to WH Smith with shoppers complaining of ‘crowded stores with limited stock’. Other poor performers were Homebase, HMV, EE the mobile phone chain and the 99p Stores.

The Which? magazine editor, Richard Headland, said: ‘We’ve seen time and again that people won’t settle for bad customer service and this is supported by the results of our high street shops survey. Stores giving people the care and attention they want have happy customers who return.’

The results are bad news for Apple which is under pressure to reinvigorate its reputation for innovation and delivering gadgets which quickly become lifestyle essentials.

In recent years, following the death of Apple founder Steve Jobs, the tech giant’s success has been built on small innovations to existing products, such as the thinner and lighter iPad Air.

There have also been new versions of the iPhone, including a plastic version that was billed as a cheaper option but turned out to be more expensive than most smartphones.

The company has been rumoured to be 
launching an iWatch with built-in health functions for the past two 
years, however in the meantime rivals such as Samsung and Sony have been
 allowed the space to launch their own.

Separately,
 it is under attack from Google, with its Google Glass, which are worn 
like a pair of spectacles and put the internet in front of user’s eyes 
while allowing them to video and share what they see and do.

Apple said it had no comment on the findings.

A WHSmith spokesman said: 'This exercise is very misleading as WHSmith does not fit into any of the survey categories, while products like newspapers and magazines are not those that customers would ‘recommend’ a retailer for.

'The 104 customers that commented on WHSmith in this survey are not reflective of the 12 million customers that visit our stores each week, where our own independent survey of over a thousand customers continues to rate us highly.'
