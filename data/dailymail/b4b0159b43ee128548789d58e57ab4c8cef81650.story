A Minnesota hunting club has offered to pay for the wedding and reception of a same-sex couple after first refusing to let the two men hold the ceremony there.

The Minnesota Department of Human Rights announced the settlement between the Little Falls hunting club and couple Cole Frey and Adam Block Friday.

It is the first settlement of its kind since Minnesota legalized gay marriage in 2013.

A Minnesota hunting club has offered to pay for the marriage and reception of Adam Block and Cole Frey after initially turning the couple away

According to The Minneapolis Star-Tribune, the owners of LeBlanc's Rice Creek Hunting and Recreation Inc. will pay roughly $8,500 to cover the ceremony and reception and apologize to the couple.

Frey, 20, and Block, 18, became engaged in November. Frey contacted LeBlanc's in February about holding the wedding there on his stepmother's suggestion.

He was told the date he wanted was available.

But when he went to sign the paperwork and give a security deposit, things went sour.

'That’s when they found out it would be between two males,' 
Frey told the Star-Tribune. 'They told us they don’t condone same-sex marriage, and they 
wouldn’t be marrying us on their property.'

Frey immediately called the state's Department of Human Rights and an inquiry was launched.

An investigator from the department was also turned away when calling to ask about holding a same-sex wedding.

The Little Falls hunting club said it would pay approximately $8,500 for the ceremony and reception to be held there

LeBlanc's attorney Paul Rogosheske claims his clients misunderstood state law.

'They made a mistake and we did everything in our power to correct it,' he said. 'This couple is going to have a great 
wedding and I can assure you LeBlanc’s is going to be open to 
everybody.'

Rogosheske said it the initial refusal was because of the owner's religious beliefs.

'You’ve
 got the archdiocese campaigning against the amendment, they were very 
vocal,' he said. 'You could see how people involved in a private
 hunting club, they were new to hosting weddings in the first place, you
 could see how they made a mistake.'

The owners declined interview requests.

Minnesota criminalized discrimination based on sexual orientation in 1993.

The couple said they no longer wish to have their wedding at the club because of its intolerance of same-sex marriage

Religious entities were exempted from having to take part in same-sex weddings when gay marriage was legalized there in 2013, but that exemption does not extend to businesses or individuals for their religious beliefs. 

The laws have enraged gay rights opponents

'This
 is a shameful example of government forcing citizens to accept the 
government’s view of sexuality and marriage,' said Minnesota Family Council CEO John Helmberger.

Even, without Helmberger's blessing, the happy couple's wedding will take place next Friday, at a private home.

'We
 kind of came to the conclusion, anyway, that we didn’t want to have it 
there because we didn’t want to be associated with them in that way,' Frey said.
