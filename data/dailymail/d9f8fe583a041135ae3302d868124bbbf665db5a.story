Repeated claims: Brown believes Princess Margaret gave birth to him in 1955, after an affair

A Jersey accountant who believes he is the secret son of Princess Margaret is renewing his legal battle to 'prove it'.

Robert Brown, 57, said he was prepared to pay up to £100,000 to get access to documents relating to her will.

Mr Brown, of St Lawrence, Jersey, said he has now appointed solicitors to obtain secret court papers about royal wills drawn up around the time of Margaret's death in 2002.

He has appointed the law firm Christian Khan, which prides itself on taking on 'larger organisations, including the state'.

Brown claims Princess Margaret gave birth to him in 1955, and he believes his father could be Robin Douglas Home, a Scottish musician who Margaret had a well publicised affair with, the Guardian reports.

He died in 1968.

Mr Brown believes that the Princess hid the later stages of her pregnancy by using body doubles and that he was sent to Kenya to be brought up as the child of Cynthia and Douglas Brown in Nairobi.

He claims the documents will reveal that Buckingham Palace, the attorney general and a senior judge colluded to keep secret her last testament, which he believes contains details of his birth.

The case has previously been dismissed by lawyers for the royal family as that of 'a fantasist seeking to feed his private obsession'.

But Mr Brown insists he has the right to find out if the Queen's sister is his mother.

Records confirm Brown was born on 5 January 1955 in Nairobi, Kenya, but his birth was not registered until 2 February.

A privy council meeting was held on the day he was born, a fact Brown believes is important.

Later in 1955, Princess Margaret called off her wedding to Peter Townsend.

Brown's parents, Cynthia and Douglas Brown, are both now dead, but he said Cynthia had been a model working for Hardy Amies, a designer who the princess was said to be a fan of.Mr Brown told the Guardian: 'I can't get it out of my head that I am right. I can understand people are sceptical because it seems to be childhood fantasy stuff, but it is not like that with me.'

He first went to the high court to seek disclosure of her will in 2006 and 2007.

He lost the case, but Brown is now fighting under freedom of information laws.

He said: 'It is constitutionally wholly 
inappropriate for the palace and private lawyers with the assistance of 
the attorney general to enter into utterly secret formal arrangements, 
to reflect Her Majesty's wishes, with senior judges.'

A spokesman for the Queen said the palace would not comment on the allegations made by Mr Brown. 

He said he had long believed he was not his parent's natural son as they were distant compared to the way they treated his supposed siblings.

He claims his birthday would sometimes be forgotten altogether, and his birth was not discussed with him.

He has also looked into whether he was related to Edward VIII, before considering whether Prince Philip might be his father. 

Last month, Dominic Grieve, the attorney
general, put an absolute block on the publication 
of 27 letters between Prince Charles and ministers, because the letters held the 'most deeply held 
personal views and beliefs'.
