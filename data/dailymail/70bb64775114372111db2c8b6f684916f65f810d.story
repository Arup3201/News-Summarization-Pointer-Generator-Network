Newcastle Falcons No 8 Allister Hogg has put pen to paper on a new two-year deal at Kingston Park.

Hogg ended an eight-year spell at Edinburgh to head to the north east in 2010 and he has made 117 appearances for Newcastle since then.

The 32-year-old, who has picked up 48 caps for Scotland, is the fifth player to commit to a new contract at the club, following Alex Tait, Will Welch, Tom Catterick and Callum Chick.

'Obviously I'm delighted to have signed a new contract with the club, it is in a really positive place right now, is moving in the right direction and I am keen to keep on playing a part,' Hogg told the club's website.

'It is a really competitive environment at the moment, particularly in the back row with some really talented players pushing each other to be at their best at all times and that is an environment I really want to keep being a part of.'

Dean Richards said: 'Having Ally commit to the club for another two-year deal is great news for the club and will see him continue to play an integral part of its future. We have said that our aim is to create a team based around top young, local talent, supplemented by quality additions and Ally certainly falls into that category.'
