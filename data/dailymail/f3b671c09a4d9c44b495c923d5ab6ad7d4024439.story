A leading British super-yacht brokerage has sold five top-of-the-range boats in as many weeks - with a combined asking price of £32million, it was revealed today.

The lavish boats sold by London-based Edmiston include spas, gyms and leather suites on board - and have been snapped up by two Britons, one American and a German.

While the Middle Eastern elite were the main buyers of luxury yachts during the recession, brokers have been boosted by a return to business from the super-rich in Europe and the US.

Luxury: The refurbished £8million QM of London, which can fit up to 14 guests, is one of five boats that has been sold in the same number of weeks by British super-yacht brokerage Edmiston

Meanwhile a 15 per cent rise in trade has been claimed by luxury charters, reported The Times.

Edmiston chairman Nicholas Edmiston said: ‘It’s very encouraging to see buyers re-emerge from the likes of the UK, US and Germany, which used to be the strongest markets before the downturn.’

The boats include the refurbished £8million vessels Sea Dweller, which can house up to 12 guests, and the QM of London, which can fit up to 14 guests - and comes with a water slide and jetpack.

Also sold were the £7.9million Nada which can cater for 20 guests, the £7million William Tai and the £1.7million Keewaydin, which features two mahogany guest staterooms and new teak decks.

Worth £32million: Formula One mogul Eddie Jordan's new 155ft super-yacht came complete with a nightclub, full-length bar and even a hot tub

The news comes two months after Formula One mogul Eddie Jordan was given the keys to his new 155ft super-yacht, which came complete with a nightclub, full-length bar and even a hot tub.

Larger than the average family home, the £32million four-deck Sunseeker 155 yacht includes five bedrooms and took 18 months to build, while the boat also has space for 11 members of staff.

Other British celebrities including racing driver Lewis Hamilton and retail mogul Sir Philip Green are known to enjoy yachts - with the latter said to own the 212ft Silver Angel, according to The Times.

The biggest super-yacht on water is the 590ft Azzam, owned by United Arab Emirates president Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan - 57ft longer than Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich's Eclipse.
