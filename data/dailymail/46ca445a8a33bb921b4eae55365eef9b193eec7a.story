Norwegian gunman Anders Behring Breivik cried out in joy as he carried out his massacre on Utoya last year, his trial heard today.

Witness Tonje Brenna claims Breivik shouted 'woo-hoo' as he shot dead 69 people on the island.

Her account was the first of several from survivors of the youth camp shootings today which detailed their panicked attempts to hide during the rampage.

Earlier, the court turned down Breivik's request to question them on the stand.

Ms Brenna, a leading member of the Labor Party's youth wing, described how she sought shelter behind rocks on the shore of Utoya island on July 22 as her colleagues were shot around her. She came across a girl who was bleeding heavily.

'I tried to stop the haemorrhaging and keep her awake,' she was reported as saying on the BBC website.

'Then a person lands by my feet, head first and bleeding profusely from the head. I believed that person was dead. There was a feeling of being completely abandoned and of hopelessness - nobody could do anything.'

Stealth tactics: Earlier in the trial, witnesses described in chilling detail how Breivik duped them into believing he was a policeman by wearing this fake police identity tag and outfit

She added: 'I'm sure I heard cries of joy. If I had to spell it out, it would be woo-hoo.'

The 24-year-old told the Oslo court she 'smelled gunpowder' from her hiding place and that 'it stung in my eyes'.

Another witness, a local resident, described going out in his boat expecting to be shot as he plucked terrified youths from the water as they tried to swim away from the island.

Breivik has admitted killing 69 people on the island, and another eight in a car bomb attack a few hours earlier in Oslo.

Breivik has said he considered the Utoya camp a legitimate target because he claims the Labor Party betrayed Norway by supporting multiculturalism.

He claims he is an anti-Muslim resistance fighter on a campaign to protect Norway's cultural identity.

Since he has admitted his actions, Breivik's mental state is the key issue for the trial to resolve.

If found guilty and sane, Breivik would face 21 years in prison, although he can be held longer if deemed a danger to society.

If declared insane, he would be committed to compulsory psychiatric care.

The trial is expected to last up to the end of June.
