Constantly worrying won’t just give you sleepless nights – it could also raise your risk of Alzheimer’s.

Women who are anxious, jealous and moody in middle-age were twice as likely to suffer from the brain disease in old age as their more calm and level-headed counterparts.

They found that as the number of people with dementia is expected to increase ‘dramatically’ as the population ages, it is important to have ways of identifying those most at risk.

Neurotic women who display personality traits such as jealousy and anxiety may be twice as likely to suffer from Alzheimer's than their more calm and level-headed counterparts

Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia affect more than 800,000 Britons and, worldwide, the number of sufferers is predicted to treble to 44million by 2050.

The Prime Minister David Cameron has described dementia as ‘the key health challenge of this generation’.

Some 800 women in their late 30s, 40s and early 50s underwent a battery of personality tests.

This included questions on neuroticism – characterised by being anxious, jealous, moody and easily upset and plagued by feelings of guilt.

They were also asked if they had been under stress at work, at home or due to their health – and this question was repeated every five years.

When the study ended after 38 years, some 153 women had developed dementia.

Those who scored highest on tests for neuroticism in middle-age – were particularly prone to the disease – but only if they had been under long-term stress.

Neurotics who were also shy and introverted were at the highest risk, the journal Neurology reports.

The researchers said those who are neurotic may feel stress more keenly and this could take its toll on the brain.

It is also possible that they have a less healthy lifestyle.

Neurotics who were also shy and introverted were at the highest risk of dementia, researchers found 

Study author Lena Johannsson said: ‘Most Alzheimer’s research has been devoted to factors such as education, heart and blood risk factors, head trauma, family history and genetics.

‘Personality may influence the individual’s risk for dementia through its effect on behaviour, lifestyle or reactions to stress.

‘The number of people with dementia is expected to rise dramatically. It is therefore important to identify risk and protective factors.’

Dr Clare Walton, of the Alzheimer’s Society said: ‘We all have moments when we feel stressed or worried, but stressed women reading this shouldn’t take this research to mean they’re necessarily at higher risk of dementia.

‘This research doesn’t show that neuroticism in women alone could increase risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, but what it does suggest is that personality traits like neuroticism are linked to the experience of long term stress.

‘While we can’t control all the sources of everyday stress, we can develop coping strategies to deal with them and we’re funding research to help explore how this could help with reducing risk of dementia.’

Dr Simon Ridley, of Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: ‘Understanding the factors that affect our risk of Alzheimer’s could provide new clues for preventing the disease, which is why investment in research is crucial.’

Previous research has found that conscientious men and women, who ‘always get the job done’ are half as likely to develop Alzheimer’s as their less dependable friends and colleagues.

May be because they feel stress more keenly - which takes its toll on brain
