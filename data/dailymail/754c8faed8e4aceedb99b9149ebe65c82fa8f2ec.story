A mystery EPA employee in Denver seems more intent on spreading toxic waste than cleaning it up. 

The agency has received more than a dozen reports of 'beyond gross' behavior in its Denver office - including a woman who has been smearing menstrual blood and human feces on the walls.

Other reports include 'a trail of [human waste] leading out in the hallway' near the men's bathroom, an employee who urinated on the toilet seat and floor of the bathroom, and another employee who defecated outside the building when he was locked out.   

In June, a memo from Deputy Regional Administrator Howard Cantor was released publicly that revealed the Denver office of the EPA was beset by an employee who was clogging toilets and putting human waste on the floor outside the bathroom.

Toxic waste dump: The EPA's Denver office has been beset by a mystery employee who is smearing human waste and menstrual blood on the walls

A new report from environmental policy newsletter Greenwire reveals that bathroom problems were even more prevalent than previously thought. And while the incidents appear to have stopped, the perpetrator was never caught.

Now, the Environmental Protection Agency is calling in the Department of Homeland Security to protect employees from the contamination in the office. In emails obtained by Greenwire, employees report being 'terrified' by the perpetrator and fear she could become violent. 

Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service, which provides security for federal offices, has stepped up patrols. The EPA has also brought in a workplace violence consultant and increased its own security at the office. 

Newly-released emails from EPA employees reveal a slew of disguising behavior at the office.

'A male supervisor ... told her that management knows that it is a female on the [redacted] floor who has been wiping feces and menstrual blood on the walls (I'm really sorry, this is beyond gross) and that they are worried that her behavior is escalating,' according to one email obtained by Greenwire. 

Another email reported: 'The incidents of urine on the seats and the floors are still occurring regularly in the women's restrooms; however they are no longer limited to the 6th and 7th floors. Employees are now reporting incidents more frequently.'

Another employee sent a picture of an overflowing toilet to bosses.  

In another email, an employee told bosses: 'I can think of two people right off the bat that should be checked out. .. one who under the context of emergency, defecated outside the building when precluded from coming into the building prior to 5:30am.'

The incidents have led some employees to fear the perpetrator could become violent and even commit a workplace shooting. Employees have reported one coworker who was found with ammunition. Another was reported to printed off specifications for a rifle in the office.
