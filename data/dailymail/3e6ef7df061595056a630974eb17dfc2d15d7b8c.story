A woman has been arrested on suspicion of assaulting a resident at a care home that was the subject of an investigation by the BBC’s Panorama.

The woman, aged in her 40s, was arrested on Friday after detectives from Essex Police examined footage from the Old Deanery Care Home in Braintree.

She has since been released on bail, pending further inquiries.

Anglia Retirement Homes Ltd, which runs the site, sacked seven members of staff there after Panorama last week showed an elderly woman with dementia being bullied and slapped.

Staff in a scandal-hit care home called elderly people by their room numbers instead of using their names, the documentary revealed.

The sinister habit was part of the regime at the care home where the BBC investigation uncovered widespread abuse of vulnerable residents.

Astonishingly, the practice at the Old Deanery in Braintree, Essex, was observed by official inspectors during a surprise visit last autumn – but they still gave the home a clean bill of health.

Officials from the Care Quality Commission (CQC) passed the scandal-hit home as safe having also apparently missed the horrific abuse which was being filmed by Panorama’s undercover cameras at the same time.

It allowed the home to continue operating without sanctions – and without any of the staff being disciplined.

Dementia sufferers and other elderly residents were frequently left in their own mess by staff who failed to answer their pleas.

The unannounced CQC inspection carried out in November found the 93-bed, £700-a-week home met approved standards on all counts.

Inspectors took no action even after discovering that the staff did not use the names of residents but habitually labelled them by their room numbers.

The report said: ‘We heard several staff referring to people by their room number rather than their name.’
