The brothers' father, who was caught with 200 phones, was earlier cleared after prosecutors could find no evidence they were stolen

A family of Romanian pickpockets who stole from commuters to build palaces in their homeland were jailed yesterday by a judge who expressed his shock at the clan’s ‘deep-rooted criminality’.

The Rostas family preyed on train passengers as they slept on late night trains going out of London, stealing hundreds of mobile phones and cash.

The gipsy gang even used their children as ‘trainee pickpockets’, teaching them that theft is ‘not a serious crime’.

Criminals: The thefts were carried out by the (clockwise from above left) Romulus, 18, Marin, 25, Cornell, 22  and Robert, 23, along with 17-year-old Govinder (not pictured) who was named for the first time today

The family, who were living on 
benefits in Britain, pocketed hundreds of thousands of pounds by 
stealing from at least 185 victims over two years, although police fear 
the true number may be at least 1,000.

The stolen phones were sold in Romania for huge profits.

Earlier this year the Daily Mail 
revealed how the gang enjoyed a life of luxury in Romania where they 
built five mansions with the proceeds while they swaggered around in 
designer clothing, gold jewellery and drove a fleet of luxury cars.

Yesterday five members of the family 
were jailed for conspiracy to steal, but after an unusual plea bargain 
in the middle of their trial at Blackfriars Crown Court, some could walk
 free within weeks.

Brothers Romulous Rostas, 18, Marin, 
25, their cousin by marriage Cornell Rostas, 22, and another cousin 
Govinder, 17, changed their pleas to guilty midway through the trial 
following a rare so-called ‘Goodyear’ hearing in which defence 
barristers receive guidance from the judge about the sentence a 
defendant would expect if he admitted his guilt.

Another member of the family, Robert Rostas, 23, had earlier admitted the charges.

Yesterday Cornell Rostas was jailed 
for three years and three months, Marin for three years, Robert for 30 
months, Romulous for 18 months and Govinder was given a 12-month 
detention and training order.

Romulous will be free within five months, while Robert will serve less than a year.

Judge Peter Clarke, QC, described 
their racket as a ‘highly organised and regimented criminal enterprise’,
 saying: ‘It’s depressing to see a family represented by so many members
 showing such deep-rooted criminality.’

The court heard that Romulous, Marin, Cornell and Govinder all have previous convictions for theft.

They preyed on tourists in London’s 
West End, distracting victims by offering them flowers or the Big Issue,
 while they swiped their phones.

After the hearing, Luminita Rostas, 
the mother of Marin, Robert and Romulous, screamed abuse at detectives, 
hammering her fists on a police officer’s chest.

Marin’s wife, Andrea Ferencz, was arrested outside court for spitting at a photographer.

The gang targeted late-night trains 
running from Charing Cross to Gravesend in Kent, where the family live, 
between June 2009 and August 2011.

They were captured on CCTV boarding 
the back of trains just before midnight, knowing that many of the 
commuters would be drunk, dozing or distracted listening to music after 
a  night out.

They were brought to justice after British Transport Police launched an inquiry into a spike in thefts reported on the line.

Police found 250 phones and 500 phone parts at the family’s homes.

Mail, March 31, 2012

David Hewitt, prosecuting, said: ‘It was a family affair.

‘They targeted vulnerable people who 
were tired for various reasons, travelling home late at night. The 
team’s motivation was to steal primarily mobile phones from these 
people.

‘Other members of the family have been arrested for money laundering matters.

‘A not insignificant amount of money has been relocated from this country to Romania.’

Detective Constable Tim Weekes from 
British Transport Police said: ‘These men are career criminals who have 
all previously been arrested, charged or convicted for theft-related 
matters.

Mail, September 28, 2010

‘The items we found during house 
searches, along with CCTV and mobile phone analysis, indicated that 
these men were agents involved in a highly-organised conspiracy to 
steal, aimed at generating as much money as possible to pass back to 
other family members in Romania to buy land and property.

‘We know there were more than 180 
crimes – more than £60,000 worth of stolen property – linked to this 
group, but these are minimum estimates and the true figure could have 
been much higher because many thefts may have been reported as lost 
property or not reported at all.’

Detectives are now investigating how huge wads of cash were transferred from Britain to Romania.

Police hope to claw back the proceeds 
of their crimes and last month they arrested other members of the family
 on suspicion of money laundering following the Mail investigation.

Mirela Rostas, Andrea Ferencz, 
Luminata Rostas and Damian Rostas were held on suspicion of making 
transfers of thousands of pounds to Romania to fund the family’s luxury 
lifestyle. They are currently on bail.

In Britain the gipsy gang lived on benefits, claiming to be homeless and destitute.

Six adults and six children lived in squalor in a rundown and cramped three-bedroom terraced house in Northfleet, Kent.

But earlier this year a Daily Mail investigation revealed how the Rostas family stole from hundreds of British commuters to fund a lavish lifestyle in Romania, where they built five palaces with the proceeds of their massive pickpocketing racket.

The gang boasted of their riches in their homeland where they decorated their gaudy blue-roofed mansions with the Mercedes car emblem to denote their wealth.

In the small town of Huedin, near Cluj in Transylvania, relatives of the clan were seen swaggering around dressed in shiny designer tracksuits and decked out in gold jewellery.

Parked outside their 16-bedroom villas were Mercedes, Audis and BMWs with English and Irish number plates.

The wealthy family also own two farms and recently bought another plot of land for 30,000 euros in nearby Calatele.

Ostentatious: The distinctive luxury homes built by the the family - who admit to robbing sleeping commuters - tower over the town in north-west Romania

One relative said: ‘Yes, we are very, very rich family. We work in England, Spain and France. We make a lot of money.’

Police believe the family may be part of a wider organised criminal network spread across Europe, operating in Britain, Ireland, Spain and France, stealing valuable iPhone and BlackBerry handsets.

Yesterday Blackfriars Crown Court was told that 17-year-old Govinder Rostas had been ‘groomed’ by his family to become a ‘trainee pickpocket’.

Asking for him to be spared jail, his lawyer Rebecca Helliwell said: ‘This is how he has been brought into the world. This is his upbringing, his way of life. In his culture theft is not thought of as a serious crime.’
