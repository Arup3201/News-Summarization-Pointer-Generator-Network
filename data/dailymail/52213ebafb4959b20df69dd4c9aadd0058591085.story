Mike was a rock in the England team I was privileged to coach and was always one of the first names on the team sheet.

I dropped him just once — that was for the 2003 World Cup semi-final which was totally a tactical call because I particularly wanted two ball players in midfield against the French, so I brought in Mike Catt.

Come the final against Australia, Mike was straight back in alongside Will Greenwood because, among other things, I wanted him to sort out Stirling Mortlock, which he did in style.

That semi-final week in Sydney demonstrated the full measure of the man. Mike was totally supportive of the team and unquestioning of my difficult call, despite the disappointment. He remained just as energetic and committed in training and as vocal in the changing room, in fact more so. He was the complete model professional.

Mike came into the England team when we started to rebuild after the 1999 World Cup, and his partnership alongside Greenwood served us magnificently well.

He was sometimes under-rated but not by me or any of the England guys who played alongside Tinds. He was very strong, ran a nice outside curve, had a big clearing kick, was hugely brave in the tackle and contact area and had a much better passing game than he was given credit for.

For a few years, Mike was as good as any centre in the world, right up there with Brian O’Driscoll. Take a look at the recording of England’s 2003 Grand Slam decider against Ireland at Lansdowne Road and watch their battle carefully.

Setting the standard: but Mike Tindall in his pomp was as good as Brian O'Driscoll (centre)

Tindall, in his pomp, would walk into the current England team in that problem outside centre spot. I rate him above Manu Tuilagi although Manu is still fairly young and has the potential to take his game to another level yet.

The ultimate team man, Mike was always at the heart and soul of the group. At meetings he was generally fairly quiet and attentive, but as the game approached he would always start to energise proceedings and he was a strong, confident voice in the dressing room. He was hugely respected by his peers.

When Mike was called before the RFU Disciplinary Board after the 2011 World Cup, I had no hesitation in appearing as a character witness for him at the hearing at Twickenham. I was very proud to do so. I believe what happened in New Zealand was blown out of proportion, and I thought it important that somebody reiterated his complete devotion to England over a long career.

Mike will make an exceptional coach and I’m encouraged to hear he might be looking in that direction. He listens, absorbs and learns, and those are great traits when you match them with his love of the game and instinctive understanding of what makes players tick.

He’s the last of the 2003 squad to hang up his boots but I don’t lament that passing of time. We all sort of drew a line in the sand at England’s 10-year reunion last November, which was a great occasion but I suspect possibly the last time we will ever all get back together in the same room for a function.

Everybody is out there now living their new, busy, ‘different’ lives, heading off in different directions, which is how it should be. Everybody becomes an ex-player eventually.
