Commons Speaker John Bercow has been called a ‘little weasel’ by a mother who reported him to police for allegedly ‘walloping’ her car.

Nathalie Pulford dismissed the MP as an ‘arrogant toff’ after watching him try to squeeze his Volvo into a tight parking spot in Chelsea.

The 42-year-old divorcee had been dining with her father and two sons, aged ten and 12, when she saw Mr Bercow attempting to manoeuvre his vehicle into a small space near her Range Rover.

Rebuttal: Mr Bercow's spokesman said today that he would happy for Ms Pulford to take the matter up with his insurer

She believed she saw her luxury car move so ran outside the restaurant to tell off the Speaker.

Mr Bercow denied pranging her car and said he had been offended by her behaviour. Miss Pulford, who has reported Wednesday evening’s incident to police, said she asked Mr Bercow if it was his Volvo and he said it was.

‘I asked him if he realised that he’d just bashed both cars to get in his spot and he said, “No I didn’t” so I replied “Yes you did because I was just watching you”.

‘He was not willing to discuss it and was completely dismissive of me. I stood there absolutely dumbfounded.

‘I said, “If you didn’t touch these cars how about you prove me wrong and get out without touching them?” and he said, “I will do no such thing” and “I am not required to leave this space therefore I won’t do it”.

Ticking off: Speaker John Bercow is berated by Nathalie Pulford who later accused him of behaving like an 'arrogant toff' because she says he clipped her parked car

Difference of opinion: Natalie Pulford claims John Bercow's Volvo struck her Range Rover but he says that he didn't

Indignant: Nathalie Pulford charged out of a Chelsea restaurant and said to the MP: 'Don't you realise you absolutely bashed into my car?'

‘I felt such a fool because something quite trivial had become out or proportion.

'If he’d have turned round and said sorry I wouldn’t have asked him to pay for it, but he kept looking at me square in the eyes and said, “I didn’t do it”. If I’d have seen how bad the damage was I’d have asked for his details.’

She said Mr Bercow’s car was covered in scrapes and scratches.

Accusations: Natalie Pulford says 'he was being 
really haughty, being a completely arrogant toff', but he says 'she was 
clearly very irate, but I totally reject any suggestion (about) the 
scratches on her car '

In the gap: Ms Pulford stands between her Range Rover and the Speaker's Volvo, which she said hit her vehicle and another in a tight manoeuvre

‘He should have left a note on the window – that’s what I would have done.

'It’s disgraceful. He’s a little weasel.

'Everyone has bad days but it would be nice if he gave me an apology or just admitted it.

'Witnesses saw it happen. How can anybody be so conceited? I am sure he thinks he’s above the law.’

Mr Bercow admitted to a reporter at the scene that he was ‘not the best driver’ but insisted: ‘Am I too arrogant to say sorry? No. I’d be happy to fess up, but the fact is I didn’t touch her car. I don’t know why she got so angry.’

Scene: The incident happened on Sloane Avenue in Chelsea outside the Gaucho restaurant on the right

A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who as Speaker is paid £142,642 a year, said he had been attending a charity event at his children’s school, adding: ‘He strongly denies that his car hit this lady’s car. If she wants to raise it with her insurer, he would be more than happy to defend himself. He was simply bewildered at the time.’

It is claimed that a waitress at Gaucho backed Ms Pulford's version of events.

Nadia
Green said: 'I saw the bump. I was taking an order and the (Bercow's) 
car literally touched both of the other cars to get into the space. He 
was trying to squeeze in.'

Mr Bercow was on his way to a school charity auction in a nearby church at the time of the incident.

The police confirmed the matter had been reported.

A
spokesman for the Met said: 'Police were called at shortly after 
01.00hrs on Thursday 3 October by a motorist reporting a damage only 
collision that occurred at around 18.20hrs on Wednesday, 2 October in 
Ixworth Place, SW3.

'The motorist has been asked to attend a police station when convenient to fully report the matter.'
