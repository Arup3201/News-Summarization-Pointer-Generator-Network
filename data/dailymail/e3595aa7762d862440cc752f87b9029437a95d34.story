The embattled top cop who faced a firestorm of outcry over his department's investigation of the Trayvon Martin shooting has been axed from his post.

Chief Bill Lee had only been police chief in Sanford, Florida, for about a year, taking the position in April 2011 after nearly three decades as a deputy in the Seminole County Sheriff's Office.

Sanford City Manager Norton Bonaparte said in a statement on Wednesday that he fired Lee after determining 'the police chief needs to have the trust and respect of the elected officials and the confidence of the entire community.'

Bonaparte added: 'We need to move forward with a police chief that all the citizens of Sanford can support. 'I have come to this decision in light of the escalating divisiveness that has taken hold of the city.'

Sara Brady, a spokeswoman for the former chief, said Lee and Bonaparte met Wednesday morning to discuss his termination.

She said: 'They had a discussion this morning, but the details were not worked out, and that is how it was left.'

Lee had been on paid leave since March and even offered to quit in April, but the city council rejected his resignation by a 3-2 vote, mostly because the council wished to hold out for a Department of Justice review of the investigation of Trayvon Martin's death and his alleged killer. 

In May, Rick Myers took over as 
Sanford's interim police chief, saying he wanted to heal the emotional 
wounds caused by Martin's death.

Killed: Trayvon Martin was 17 years old when he was shot dead on February 26

Martin's parents, Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton, said they respect the city7 manager's decision.

Their attorney, Benjamin Crump said: 'They remain vigilant in getting justice for their son and the tragedy that claimed his life.'

Also on Wednesday, the desperate phone call of Tracy Martin in a desperate effort to find his son was revealed.

From his girlfriend's home in a Sanford, Florida, gated community, Martin contacted a police non-emergency line on February 27 - the morning after Trayvon left the house for a nearby 7-Eleven but never returned.

But what Tracy Martin didn’t know was that his son was dead, shot in the chest by George Zimmerman, who claimed he was acting in self-defence.

As the call was made, police were trying to identify the body of the 17-year-old, who had not been carrying identification.

In audio obtained by NBC News through a Freedom of Information request, Tracy Martin speaks calmly: 'I need to file a missing persons report. It hasn’t really been 24 hours.'

He added: 'But I'm from Miami. And my son’s up here with me. I’m in Sanford. He don’t know anybody up here.'

He said that he last saw his son between 8 and 8:30 the night before.

That was when Trayvon, who had been 
watching the NBA All-Star Game at the home, left to pick up a drink and some
candy for his younger brother.

When asked what his son might be wearing, he told the dispatcher that Trayvon had been wearing khaki shorts, a grey sweatshirt and Jordan Taylor shoes.

As Martin walked back to his father's
girlfriend's home in Sanford, he was spotted by Zimmerman, a 
neighbourhood watch volunteer who had become concerned with recent 
burglaries in the area.

Zimmerman called 911 to report a suspicious person, telling the operator that the teenager looked like he 'was up to no good.'

The
operator advised Zimmerman to stay in his truck and not follow the 
person. But he, for unknown reasons, ignored her, saying: 'These 
a**holes always get away.'

Details
of what happened next remain sketchy, but a confrontation took place 
between Zimmerman and Martin and the two began fighting.

Zimmerman
claimed that he lost track of Martin and was returning to his truck 
when the teen suddenly appeared and 'sucker-punched' him.

As the two struggled, Zimmerman claims Martin saw the pistol he was carrying and reached for it.

That was when Zimmerman drew the gun himself and shot him.

The teen was not armed. He had only a can of Arizona Iced Tea and a bag of Skittlesr.

According
to statements made by Martin’s girlfriend, who was on the phone with 
the teen the night of February 26, his last words were: ‘Get off, get 
off.’

His cell phone then cut off and Martin was shot, his girlfriend said in the interview with a prosecutor.

Zimmerman was taken into custody by police but later released in accordance with Florida's 'stand your ground' law.

Under
the 'stand your ground' law, people are given wide latitude to use deadly force rather 
than retreat in a fight if they believe they are in danger of being 
killed or seriously injured, they weren't committing a crime themselves 
and are in a place they have the legal right to be.

The
original prosecutor in the case accepted Zimmerman's invocation of the 
law after the shooting but a special prosecutor rejected it in April, 
charging Zimmerman with second-degree murder.

Zimmerman was arrested and later released on bail, but it was revoked weeks later.

He turned himself in and was returned to the John E. Polk Correctional Facility, where he remains today. His next day in court is scheduled for June 29, when he will have a bond hearing.
