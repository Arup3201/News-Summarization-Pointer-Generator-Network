An unsuspecting supermarket employee got an alarming surprise this week.

The worker at an Albertsons store in Roswell, New Mexico, opened a container of frozen ribs Wednesday and found a .38 super semi-auto handgun along with seven rounds of ammunition packaged with the meat.

He brought the firearm and ammo to a local police department at about 2pm that afternoon and authorities are beginning to piece together some preliminary clues, a police public relations liaison said.

Mystery in the meat: A .38 super semi-auto handgun and seven rounds of ammunition were found packaged in a case frozen ribs at an Albertsons supermarket in Roswell, New Mexico

Gun control: An Albertsons employee brought the firearm and ammo to a local police department at about 2pm Wednesday and authorities are beginning to piece together some clues

However, since the unidentified employee cleaned the pistol before turning it in, tracing its origin has not been easy, authorities say.

There are no fingerprints to go by and as of now there is little indication why the gun was packaged separately in the container the frozen meat.

A police report shows that the meat came from the Swift Packing Plant in Greeley, Colorado, and is marked with the date June 8, 2011.

Greeley police say that they are reviewing cases to see if the gun had been used in any crimes.

Time to backtrack: Little is known about where the gun came from and how it ended up with the frozen meat

Dumbfounded: 'I have personally never heard of this in 13 years,' said Roswell police sergeant Jim Preston

The gun had not been reported stolen and a firearms trace could take weeks, Roswell police told NBC.

In the meantime, the officers are hoping a database query through the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms may provide some more clues.

That could also take some time -- possible months -- Roswell police sergeant Jim Preston told New Mexico's KOB.com.
