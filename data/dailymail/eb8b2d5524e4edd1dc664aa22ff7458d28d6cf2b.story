Wasps euphorically claimed to have ‘got the monkey off our backs’ with this first away win in nine months, but Gloucester’s own pesky primate continues to weigh them down after yet another setback at home.

There was a full house at Kings-holm on Sunday but the mood of festive cheer in the renowned Shed was soon wiped away. 

The hosts were desperate to atone for the emphatic loss at the hands of Bath at the same ground eight days earlier but instead they slumped to a fourth defeat in their last five home games in the Aviva Premiership. What was once an intimidating stronghold has become far too welcoming.

While Gloucester remain ninth with persistent problems to address, Wasps have risen to sixth after their first victory on the road since beating Worcester on March 21. First-half tries by Christian Wade, Tom Varndell and Nathan Hughes came as an astute kicking game spread panic in the Cherry-and-White ranks. 

Despite Gloucester’s stirring second-half fightback, Wasps held on to claim a win which was arguably more significant even than the success on their first outing at the Ricoh Arena last week. Director of rugby Dai Young said: ‘We got the monkey off our back. Coming into this we’d won all our home games and lost all our away games. It was nice to get that away victory.

‘In the first half we controlled the game and I was really pleased. At half-time we talked about things we needed to do in the second half and we pretty much did none of them. We turned over the ball eight or nine times and put ourselves under pressure. We were really poor.

‘But I was pretty pleased with how we closed the game out. We found a way to win. It gives us confidence to go away and grind out a victory, especially in the last five minutes because I’ve lost count of how many games we’ve lost in the last five.’

Wasps half-backs Andy Goode and Joe Simpson had Gloucester in disarray with their aerial onslaught in the first half, but only after Jonny May had given the home side a first-minute lead. 

When James Hook’s cut-out pass reached Mark Atkinson, he picked out England wing May, who cut inside to score and Greig Laidlaw converted.

What followed was grim viewing for the Shed as their heroes unravelled in defence. In the ninth minute, Varndell broke through Steve McColl’s tackle on the flank and offloaded superbly for Wade to go over from close range. 

Goode’s conversion began his flawless return which yielded 12 points from three conversions and two penalties.

In the 20th minute, the veteran fly-half’s high kick into the 22 bounced awkwardly behind Charlie Sharples and Varndell was able to gather and surge past the flailing McColl to touch down. 

There was a powerful riposte as Gloucester’s pack rumbled forward from a lineout for Matt Kvesic to strike but they were soon exposed again at the other end, in identical fashion, as the Wasps eight drove Nathan Hughes over to score.

After a dressing-down at half-time, the home side rallied strongly and three penalties by Laidlaw brought them back to within a point on the hour. But there was to be no glorious comeback as Goode and Elliot Daly struck late penalties.

Gloucester’s director of rugby David Humphreys said: ‘At the start of our year, one of our targets was to make Kingsholm a difficult place for teams to come but our recent results here haven’t backed that up.

‘After another home defeat, the long-term plan doesn’t seem as important as getting short-term results. We all know we are in a results business and we want to win. But we also know we have good players and there are aspects of our game that are improving. We are four months into a long-term project. The fans know that we’re not where we want to be, but they realise that we are a work in progress.’

John Afoa, Gloucester’s World Cup-winning All Black prop, delivered his own damning assessment, adding: ‘It was really disappointing. You look at the body language of the boys — really down and out. We let another game slip through our fingers. We are down in confidence. Maybe some guys are not making the right calls.’
