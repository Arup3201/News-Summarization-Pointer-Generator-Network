Caught napping: Within hours of Liberal Democrat Mike Thornton being chosen to fight Chris Huhne¿s Eastleigh constituency, this 2011 photograph emerged of him apparently asleep on the job.

For a man struggling to retain a parliamentary seat vacated by a shamed colleague, it was perhaps not the best of starts.

Within hours of Liberal Democrat Mike Thornton being chosen to fight disgraced ex-Cabinet minister Chris Huhne’s Eastleigh constituency, a photograph emerged of him apparently asleep on the job.

The picture, which seems to show Mr Thornton nodding off, was taken at a council meeting in 2011.

As that photograph was gleefully 
circulated by opponents, the local Lib Dems moved quickly to delete from
 their website pictures they deemed far more damaging – showing the 
councillor with Mr Huhne, who quit Parliament after admitting he lied to
 police to escape a driving ban.

Mr Thornton, married with a 19-year-old daughter, faces a challenge from a Tory described as her party’s ‘answer to Sarah Palin’.

Maria Hutchings has been likened to the controversial US Republican politician because of her robust views on issues such as gay marriage and immigration, which potentially put her at odds with Conservative leadership.

Mrs Hutchings, a mother of four, rose to national prominence in 2005 when she ‘handbagged’ Tony Blair on live TV over cuts to special schools. One of her sons is autistic.

Mr Thornton said yesterday he was ‘puzzled’ by his rival’s campaign tactics, condemning her opposition to gay marriage. He said: ‘I’m surprised she hasn’t been co-opted by UKIP.’

Polls suggest the by-election on February 28 will be close. A Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday put the Lib Dems on 36 per cent, ahead of the Tories on 33 per cent, with UKIP on 16 per cent – suggesting the anti-EU party could deprive the Tories of victory – and Labour on 13 per cent. However, a poll last week gave the Conservatives a three-point lead.

Mr Huhne held Eastleigh at the 2010 election with a 3,864 majority.

The by-election will put the Coalition
 under immense strain, with the Tories going all out to snatch the seat 
from their Lib Dem partners.

Deputy
 Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who will visit the Hampshire constituency 
today, has revealed that he and David Cameron are not co-ordinating 
their diaries and could therefore end up campaigning in Eastleigh at the
 same time.

A Tory victory 
would be a shattering blow to Mr Clegg, and the first by-election gain 
for a Prime Minister since Margaret Thatcher at the height of her 
Falklands popularity.

Mr Clegg urged people not to cast 
their vote based on the ‘courtroom drama’ involving Mr Huhne but he 
conceded it is an issue. He said: ‘I’ve heard lots of people say they 
don’t like what’s happening in the court, but they actually think that 
what he did as a local MP was the model of a Liberal Democrat working 
hard for the local community.’

Business Secretary Vince Cable, said 
he was confident of a Lib Dem victory, with the by-election a good 
chance to highlight differences with the Tories.

But
 he risked angering his Coalition partners by revealing that the Lib 
Dems are in talks with Labour on long-term plans for pensions and 
industrial strategy.

That will be seen as another indication that Mr Cable is ready to seek a deal with Labour after the 2015 General Election.

Tory
 former Cabinet minister Liam Fox said the Lib Dems had a ‘problem with 
trust’ over student tuition fees, an EU referendum and the blocking of a
 bid to make constituency boundaries fairer.

Shamed: The by-election is being held to replaced ex-Cabinet Minister Chris Huhne who resigned from his seat in Eastleigh, Hants., after admitting that he lied to police to escape a driving ban
