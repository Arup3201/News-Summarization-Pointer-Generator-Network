Raging seas have claimed two lives in two days as 2014 began with storms across the UK.

A 27-year-old reveller was feared drowned yesterday after he paddled into the sea in severe gales ‘for a laugh’ and was swept away by 15ft waves.

The unnamed victim disappeared beneath the swell after he joined friends for a celebratory dip shortly after midnight yesterday.

His four friends made it back to shore near Porthleven, Cornwall, and raised the alarm at 1am, triggering a major rescue attempt.

Coastguards braved gale force nine winds to search for the missing man – thought to be on holiday from Surrey – but were beaten back by waves as Britain was hit by another day of storms.

Most of the country experienced heavy rain sweeping in from the Atlantic, bringing more than 100 flood alerts. The weather is set to clear up a little in most parts today, but widespread rain is expected to return tomorrow.

Yesterday morning conditions meant rescue crews were forced to call off their search at 4am without any sign of the missing man.

The mission was resumed at first light with assistance from a further 20 volunteers but authorities say it is unlikely the reveller could have survived the night at sea.

Twelve hours earlier, on the afternoon
 of New Year’s Eve, a woman was swept away while reportedly trying to 
body-board off Croyde Bay in North Devon, facing 11ft waves.

Coastguard
 crews were alerted at 11.20am on Tuesday, and although she was pulled 
from the water an hour and a half later, she died in hospital.

The woman, who had not been named by police last night, was also said to have been on holiday in the area.

Elsewhere, a 71-year-old man was pulled from freezing waters by firemen yesterday, after his wife clung on to his wrist for half an hour to save him.

He was semi-conscious and suffering from hypothermia after falling from a pontoon next to his boat at Port Solent, Hampshire.

Watch manager Steve Pearce, who oversaw the rescue, said the man was ‘very lucky’ to be alive, adding: ‘The man’s wife was holding on to him. He’d been in the water for about 30 minutes before she managed to raise the alarm.’

In Aberystwyth, west Wales, a 30-year-old man was arrested after swimming in 15ft waves. A friend called for help when the man got into difficulties and police arrived just after he had struggled ashore.

But officers had to wade in to stop him going back into the surf and he was arrested for his own safety.

Inspector Julian Bowen described the man’s behaviour as  ‘extremely irresponsible’.
