Prince Harry joked that a taxi driver needed to learn to drive properly and that another was drunk in amusing notes he wrote to their children during a night out.

The hand written letters were proudly posted on Twitter by the youngsters yesterday, including one which was uploaded under the heading 'My Dad Picked Up Prince Harry Last Night'.

The message read: 'Dear Mickie. Your dad loves you very much! Teach him to drive properly. Love Harry!'

In another note, which begins 'Dear 
Freddie', the 28-year-old confessed that he 'also hates football', 
adding: 'Your dad is a legend but drinks and drives I'm sure! Cheers! 
Harry.'

A third letter to Callie Connolly said: 'Happy Birthday Callie! 14yo! Your dad is a legend. Love Harry'.

The notes were written by the Prince during a night out at Bodo's Schloss in London.

The 'apres ski' themed nightclub in Kensington is owned by Harry's oldest friend Tom Van Straubenzee, who is engaged to Lady Melissa Percy, the eldest daughter of the Duke of Northumberland.

Harry is one leave from the Army having recently returned from a four months tour of Afghanistan.

He is thought to have been joined by Princess Beatrice and cast members from the reality television show Made In Chelsea.

A poor quality photograph was tweeted by Marina Stephens, who wrote: 'Looky who we were out with last night! #princeharry #royalnightout.'

Another reveller, Lucie Stevenson claimed Harry, who recently returned from a four months tor of Afghanistan, bought everyone in the nightspot shots.

Harry was deployed in Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter co-pilot and grabbed headlines on his return by boasting that he had shot at Taliban insurgents.
