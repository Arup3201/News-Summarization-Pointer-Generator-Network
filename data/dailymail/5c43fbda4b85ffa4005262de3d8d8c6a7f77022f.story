President Obama's one-night stay in Brisbane for the G20 summit cost taxpayers $1.7 million, a report has revealed.

The cost is said to have covered 4,096 rooms at three separate hotels for his entourage of security guards and assistants on November 15.

According to the Justification document published by the White House, it was 'fair and reasonable based on the pricing available across the city of Brisbane at the time of the visit'. 

Lap of luxury: This was President Obama's $2,000 room in Brisbane which added to the $1.7m one-night bill

Fleeting: He stayed in the Australian city one night for the summit, and paid more than any other leader

The revelation from The Weekly Standard comes just eight months after MailOnline revealed Americans footed Obama's $2.9 million bill for hotels and rental cars in Brussels. 

The president's own room was the most expensive of all the world leaders at the summit as he based himself at the $2,000 (AUS$2,500) a night Marriott Hotel.

Meanwhile, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott opted for the thrifty $270-a-night Rydges hotel, while Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe required just $170 of public funds for his stay at Novotel. 

China's Xi Jinping came closest to Obama's bill, spending $1,450 on his room, followed by UK Prime Minister David Cameron, who handed British taxpayers a $1,070 bill for his stay.

Obama's room at the Marriott was the 1,410-square-foot presidential suite on the top floor, with a king sized bed and panoramic views of Brisbane River. 

Booked up: The presidential entourage required 4,096 rooms, which a report estimated to cost $423 each 

The Weekly Standard estimated that his staff's rooms amounted to $423 each. 

The building comprises of 28 floors of 263 rooms, four of which are suites. There are also 10 meeting rooms - 7,750 sq ft of total meeting space.

Ahead of his visit, US security officials stripped down an entire floor surrounding the presidential suite to ensure Obama was not being spied upon.

Mirrors and beds were removed from these rooms, and the suite itself was combed and verified as being safe for Obama to engage in private phone calls.
