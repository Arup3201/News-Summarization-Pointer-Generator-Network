In a move to compete with fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle and Five Guys, McDonalds is testing a new tablet ordering system which allows customers to customize their burgers with 20 mix-and-match ingredients like guacamole and tortilla chips. 

McDonald's started testing the new system last year at two Orange County stores and recently expanded to two restaurants in San Diego, but the project could be rolling out to other stores soon as the chain battles its lowest sales slump in more than a decade.

Experts say the Build Your Burger feature is designed to appeal to younger customers, which have stopped patronizing McDonald's in favor of fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle where they can chose the ingredients that go into their order.

'The problem for chains like McDonald’s is that with this generation, the Millennials in particular, the standard of expectations has risen,' John Gordon, owner of Pacific Management Consulting Group, told U-T San Diego. 'The standards that were OK for our parents, aren’t necessarily OK for us.'

The ordering system still has a few kinks it has to work out, like the fact that customers who want to also order off the main menu must submit their order at the counter, instead of just using the Build Your Burger tablet. 

At the restaurants currently offering the DIY burger option, employees stand at the front of the store explaining the tablet ordering system. 

All burgers are made with patties used for the Quarter Pounder sandwich, and are freshly grilled for every custom order.

Customers then have a choice of buttered and toasted  bun (artisan or brioche), cheese (American, sharp white cheddar, pepper jack), and an assortment of other mix-and match toppings like guacamole, grilled mushrooms, pickled jalapenos and garlic aioili.

Touch start: Customers start the Build Your Burger ordering process by using a tablet, as seen above 

Beef: All of the Build Your Burgers are made with the same beef pattie used in the Quarter Pounder sandwich 

Bun: Customers have a choice between an artisan bun and a brioche bun. Both are buttered and toasted to order 

Cheese: Instead of plain American, which McDonald's uses on its other cheeseburgers, customers can opt out for sharp white cheddar or natural pepper jack

Extras: Other toppings include guacamole, grilled mushroom and tortilla strips 

Spreads: Spicy mayo, creamy garlic sauce, ketchup, regular mayo, mustard and special sauce are among the choices of spreads

Smoky: Bacon is the only addition that costs extra in the Build Your Burger process 

The only topping that costs extra is bacon, which adds 80 cents to the order. The total cost of these burgers average around $5.49. 

When the burger is prepared, employees deliver it to the customer's table in a metal basket instead of handing it out on a plastic tray at the counter.  

And when the customer is finished eating, an employee comes out again to bus the able and to ask about the experience. 

The new ordering program appears to be an attempt to address dropping sales at the fast-food chain. 

Experts say McDonald's is trying out the program to compete with fast-casual restaurants like Chipotle, which give customers more options on their orders. Above, a line at Chipotle shows how customers choose their burrito toppings

This month, McDonald's posted its worst same-stores sales decline since 2003, and sales at stores open at least 13 months dragged 3.7 per cent in August. 

The slow sales may be due in part to the young Millennial generation's preference for fast casual restaurants. 

The percentage of customers aged 19 to 21 has fallen each month by 12.9 per cent since the beginning of 2011, and has remained flat for the 22 to 27 age group.

'McDonald's sales are declining, so they're looking for another way to generate revenues and reach a different crowd,' Joel Cohen, president of the Cohen Restaurant Marketing Group, told the Chicago Tribune.
