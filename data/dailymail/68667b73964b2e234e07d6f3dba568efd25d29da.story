Free woman: Nawal Msaad, 27, pictured  after she was cleared of funding ISIS jihadists at the Old Bailey, has revealed that she has been stopped from leaving the UK by anti-terror police

A student cleared of trying to smuggle ISIS cash from Britain to Syria in her knickers has said an anti-terror squad has now stopped her boarding a plane to see her unwell grandmother.

Nawal Msaad, 27, 'could not stop crying' as she was questioned by ten police officers at Gatwick and missed her flight to Tangier in Morocco on Sunday.

The singer, who was dubbed 'The Jihottie' online during her terror trial, believes she is on a British watch list despite not having extremist views and being cleared of any terror charges during a four-week trial last summer.

Last year she was caught with £16,000 in euros stuffed in her underwear at Heathrow as she attempted to board a flight to Istanbul, but a jury agreed  that she was tricked into being a mule by an old school friend.

But the new incident at Gatwick on Sunday means she is unable to get on with her life. 

She told the Evening Standard: 'I noticed around 10 officers came to the gate and I jokingly said, 'Are you all here for me?' 

'I explained that I was visiting my sick grandmother, and that either way I don't need an excuse to go to Morocco — my family are from there. I couldn't stop crying I was so upset'.

After 35 minutes of being searched and questioned her flight departed without her.

She said: 'I'm really annoyed personally. They were apologetic as usual, but they'll just do it again. They said they would get me on another flight, (but) there are no direct flights for a few days so I have to wait.'

Police was stopped under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act, used by police to establish if an individual is  linked or involved in terrorism.

Sussex Police said today: 'On Sunday afternoon a woman due to depart Gatwick Airport on an outbound flight for Tangier was briefly stopped and interviewed by Sussex officers at the Airport under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act.

'She was spoken to for 35 minutes and in the meantime the flight departed without her.

'We apologised for the fact that she had missed her flight and made efforts to find her an alternative flight but to no avail. We therefore supplied her with a rail warrant to enable her to return to her UK address that evening. We also offered to fund her eventual flight.

'The reasons for stopping passengers under Schedule 7 are not disclosed but specific suspicion of involvement in terrorism offences is not required. The woman was not detained under the Act, a procedure which only takes place after one hour has elapsed.'

Miss Msaad's arrest and trial alongside her former friend Ama lEl-Wahabi threw her into the spotlight.

Emotional: Miss Msaad broke down after the trial as she said she was 'physically and mentally weak' after the case and sobbed as she described her latest ordeal

CCTV: Miss Msaad was caught when the cash dropped down into her knickers as she walked through Heathrow

Anger: Police at Gatwick spoke to her and searched her for 35 minutes as her flight took off

Police believed she was due to hand the £16,000 in her pants over to a jihadi - but in fact she believed it was a deposit for a house in Turkey and was being offered a free holiday if she took it.

Miss
 Msaad, whose model looks have earned her the nickname 'jihottie' on 
social media sites, wept as she was cleared. The London Metropolitan 
University human resources management undergraduate appeared during the 
trial to be a most unlikely jihadi sympathiser.

Attending
 the Old Bailey dressed in tight-fitting shirts, high heels, pink 
lipstick and thigh-skimming skirts, the glamorous brunette appeared to 
relish the limelight.

She posted regular updates on social media of what
 she was wearing to court.  Other images on her profile showed her 
modelling jewellery and wearing short black dresses for nights out.

During
 her trial, she was seen flirting with a defendant in another case, 
provoking a reprimand from a judge after the besotted man was seen 
waving at her in court. 

After she was cleared Miss Msaad, born
 in London to Moroccan parents, accused police of targeting her because 
she was a British Muslim.

'Anyone
 out there who knows me will know I do not have any extremist views or 
support terrorism nor do I have any jihadist affiliations,' she said.

'I
 can't help but wonder if I had been called Natalie from Surrey whether 
the authorities would have pressed terrorism charges against me.' 

'Stitched up': Nawal Msaad, 27, left, was cleared of funding terrorism despite being caught with 20,000 euros handed to her by friend Amal El-Wahabi, 27, right, who was found guilty of the same charge

Anger: Nawal Msaad, pictured leaning on a car, believed she may have targeted because of her race and religion and was held for a month in custody after he arrest

Miss
 Msaad met Amal El-Wahabi, 27, who gave her the money and is also of Moroccan descent, when they were 
pupils at Holland Park School in West London and the pair remained 
close.

She told jurors she was 'stitched up' by her friend who promised 
her £790 to take the 20,000 euros to Turkey in January.

Wahabi told her the cash, in 500-euro notes, was to pay a deposit on a house in Turkey and fund a beauty therapy business there.

But
 in reality, the hairdresser was preparing to join her 30-year-old 
drug-dealing husband Aine Davis on his terrorist crusade, taking their 
two infant sons with her.

Wahabi,
 was described by her own barrister as a 'foul-mouthed, phone addicted, 
weed-smoking kaffir' collapsed, screaming, 'No, I can't breathe' as she 
was convicted of funding terrorism.

She was jailed for 28 months and claimed she thought her husband, whom she met at a West London mosque when she was 19, was helping an aid convoy in Syria.

But
 police found extremist videos sent by Davis, a former Tube driver with 
drug and firearm convictions.

He also sent a message featuring the flag 
of terrorist group ISIS, with the slogan: 'Allah prefers the Mujahadeen 
over those who remain behind.' Wahabi responded: 'Be beside you until 
the day you die.'

Police
 found photographs on Wahabi's phone of Davis posing with an AK-47 along
 with other fighters. She sent him a picture of their son in a jihadi 
headscarf.
