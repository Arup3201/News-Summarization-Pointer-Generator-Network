Driving home for Christmas may be the best idea this year after Network Rail announced a raft of closures, reduced services and bus replacements over the festive period.

Routes to major airports look set to cause travel misery for those flying too, with Gatwick Express trains suspended from Christmas Day to New Years day and some other overground services to the airport also affected.

And it's not just Gatwick passengers who may need to make alternative plans, mainline services to Heathrow and Manchester airports will also be hit by closures - all caused by engineering work.

Cancellation notices such as this one are likely to be a common sight over the festive period

Repair work will also hit services operated by the First Capital Connect (FCC), First Great Western (FGW) and Southern train companies with some routes cancelled over the festive period, and bus replacement services being put in place.

Work between Paddington station in London and Slough in Berkshire from December 27 to January 3 will cause problems for First Great Western passengers in the south east.

FGW users will also have to put up with engineering work between Oxford and Hanborough from December 27 to 29.

During the same period, work between Reading and Basingstoke will also hit services.

Bus replacement services are being offered by FGW between Maidenhead and Marlow from December 27 to 29 due to engineering work.

London Bridge station in the capital, will be effected with services between there and Gatwick part closed

And FGW services will also be disrupted from December 29 to January 3 by engineering work between Reading and Didcot Parkway.

Passengers
who travel through Gravesend will see their services hit thanks to work
on a major Â£19 million upgrade at the station in Kent.

Planned engineering works throughout Britain over the Christmas period:

First Great Western: London Paddington and Slough, December 27 to January 3Reading and Basingstoke, December 27 to 30Reading and Didcot Parkway, December 27 to January 3Oxford and Hanborough, December 27 to 29Maidenhead and Marlow, December 27 to 29

Heathrow Express: December 30 to January 1

Gatwick Express: Trains suspended from Christmas Day to New Years day

Retford and Lincoln, Gainsborough Lea Road and Lincoln, work see buses replace trains between Doncaster/Retford and Lincoln from 21 December to 5 January

Line closures between Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Airport, December 23 to 27East Midlands Trains: Spalding and Sleaford, December 28 to 30

Transport for London: London Overground works between Surrey Quays and New Cross Gate/New Cross, December 23 to 27 Earls Court part closure on District, Northern, Jubilee and Piccadilly lines, December 23 to 27London Waterloo station platforms 1-9 closed, December 27-29

Southeastern: Upgrade to Gravesend station, station closed December 22 to January 5

It will mean the Southeastern company will not be able to run any trains from or through Gravesend between December 22 and January 5 so buses are being put in place. The Gravesend work will also affect Southeastern's high-speed services.

Work between Retford and Lincoln and between Gainsborough Lea Road and Lincoln will see buses replace trains between Doncaster/Retford and Lincoln from December 21 to January 5.

In Manchester there will be engineering work from December 23 to 27 there will be engineering work between Piccadilly station and Manchester Airport with stations and lines closed at various times.

Engineering work in the Manchester Victoria area will affect Northern Rail services between December 27 and January 1.

More repairs and upgrades from December 28 to 30 will mean East Midlands Trains passengers will be offered buses in place of their usual trains between Spalding and Sleaford in Lincolnshire.

And Buses will replace trains on parts of the London Overground between December 23 and 27 due to engineering work between Surrey Quays and New Cross.

In the capital, platforms 1-9 will be
closed at Waterloo station from December 27 to 29, with disruptions to 
services by South West Trains.

On the Tube there is track replacement work at Earl's Court in west London over the festive period.

The
District and Jubilee lines will have part closures between December 27 
and 30, while the Northern line will be shut in places on December 28 
and 29.

Another company to announce closures is First Capital Connect, who have said it 
would not have any services running between Gatwick Airport and East 
Croydon from December 27 to January 1.

Passengers
travelling between Gatwick and London Bridge or Blackfriars will be 
asked to take a bus between Gatwick Airport and East Grinstead and a 
Southern service between East Grinstead and East Croydon.

Southeastern will be running some 
high-speed services between Ashford in Kent and St Pancras International
station in London on Boxing Day.

Many will now be considering alternative transport plans with part closures adding time on to routes

Some workers who need to commute between Christmas and New Year will be left with no choice but to travel

Trains will operate on a half-hourly 
basis from 8am to 8pm, with free car parking provided at Ashford and 
Ebbsfleet in north Kent.

Michael Roberts, director general of rail industry body the Rail Delivery Group, told the Mirror: 'We are living through one of the biggest investment programmes in the history of the railway.

'Passengers and businesses are benefiting from multimillion-pound projects such as King's Cross and Birmingham New Street as well as thousands of vital smaller schemes to improve tracks, signals and stations.

'Building a better network is something we do every day. But Christmas and other major holidays are when the railway is less busy than on a typical weekday. So we use these periods to carry out particularly important improvements..
