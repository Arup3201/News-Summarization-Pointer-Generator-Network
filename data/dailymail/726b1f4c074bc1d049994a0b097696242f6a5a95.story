Students today backed a petition calling on their university union to cancel a ‘sexist’ comedian’s gig.

Self-described ‘proper lad’ Dapper Laughs - real name Daniel O’Reilly - is due to bring his Socially Unacceptable tour to the Cardiff University Students’ Union, Y Plas (The Place), in February.

However, a petition demanding the union cancel the Londoner’s gig because of his ‘trivialisation of rape, unprotected sex and dehumanising of women’ has amassed almost 500 signatures in two days.

'Proper lad': Comedian Dapper Laughs, real name Daniel O’Reilly, is currently on his Socially Unacceptable tour

On the street: Dapper Laughs came to fame for his online videos where he gives ‘lad advice on romancing the ladies and being a geezer’. This still is from a Vine video entitled 'compliments are key'

It states ‘misogynistic humour should not be supported by an organisation that stands for equality’.

Petition organiser Vicky Chandler, 21, a final-year journalism student,  said: ‘Dapper Laughs is that bloke that every woman knows who dresses up sexism as banter.’

‘His jokes are so disrespectful to women and giving him a TV show and letting him perform at the university is normalising inappropriate behaviour.’

Dapper Laughs, who hails from Clapham, south-west London, came to fame for his online videos where he gives ‘lad advice on romancing the ladies and being a geezer’.

He now has his own programme on ITV2 called On The Pull and has been accused of being a misogynist and encouraging men to harass women in public.

Future date: The London comedian is due to perform at Cardiff University Students’ Union, Y Plas (The Place)

'Lad': This still is from a Vine video showing Dapper Laughs handing a beer to a London Marathon runner

In his videos, which are peppered with very explicit language, he can be seen yelling sexual comments at women on the street or from his car as he drives past.

Last year, Cardiff University Students’ Union voted to implement an ‘anti-lad culture policy’ to stamp out behaviour that encouraged ‘gender, sexuality and rape-based humour’.

And Miss Chandler said: ‘I think it is massively hypocritical for the students’ union to allow him to come and play here when he embodies everything that is wrong about lad culture.

‘Every time I go on a night out someone shouts at me or touches me. We need to do more to change the sexist culture at university. We need to make the university a safe place for women.’

Comments posted on the petition include one from Andy Williams, saying: ‘This guy would be a joke himself if his stuff wasn’t so insidious and damaging. It’s not OK to victimise women like this, and it’s massively exploitative to make a living out of rape jokes and sexism. It’s not innocent “banter”, it’s just offensive.’

Making a stand: A petition demanding the union cancel the Londoner’s gig because of his 'trivialisation of rape, unprotected sex and dehumanising of women' has amassed almost 500 signatures in two days

Dapper Laughs is one of the most successful comedians on mobile video app Vine, which distributes six-second clips playing on a loop.

After starting out as a performer on cruise ships, he now has more than 500,000 followers on Vine and over a million Facebook fans, as well as his own show on ITV2 and a popular live tour.

However, critics have repeatedly accused Dapper Laughs of sexism, arguing that his 'laddish' humour relies on treating women as objects who should only be seen as sexual conquests.

One reviewer of his TV show described his style of comedy as 'unpleasant sexism dressed up as banter', pointing to a scene in which he tells men they should not make friends with women because it reduces their chance of a one-night stand with them.

His short videos repeatedly revolve around him advising men how to get no-strings sex, or feature him accosting women in the streets.

However, defenders saying that Dapper Laughs is nothing more than a comic persona for Daniel O'Reilly, claiming that any sexism in his jokes is intended to be ironic.

Caroline Hodges added: ‘I cannot believe that an SU [students' union] that is so concerned about not encouraging lad culture that it completely rebranded one of its club nights would allow such a disgusting misogynist act to perform in it.

‘Dapper Laughs trivialises rape, objectifies women and encourages other men to do the same. We should not be providing him with a platform on which to express his warped views.’

Students’ Union president Elliot Howells said Dapper Laughs had been booked to play their Y Plas venue by an external promoter and had not been vetted by the organisation.

He added: ‘We didn’t choose to have this person come to our venue and this situation has highlighted a gap in our policies - and as a result we will be reviewing them to make sure something like this doesn’t happen again.

‘We are also looking into options to address the petition. We operate an anti-lad culture policy at our events and are committed to making the university a safe place for all students.’

Dapper Laughs is also visiting Manchester, London, Newcastle, Glasgow, Liverpool, Leeds, Birmingham and Oxford before performing in Cardiff on February 22.

Following that gig he will also play in Bristol, Bournemouth, Leicester and Nottingham. However, none of his other forthcoming dates are at university or union venues.

A spokesman for Dapper Laughs did not immediately return a request for comment from MailOnline.
