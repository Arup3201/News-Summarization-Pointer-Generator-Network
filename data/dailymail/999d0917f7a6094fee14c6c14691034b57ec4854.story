Tragic: Jason Flannery, 25, from North Yorkshire, who Thai police say died after running into a glass door in his apartment after taking cocaine

A British man died in Thailand after getting high on cocaine then running into a plate glass door, local police said.

Police found Jason Flannery, 25, a talented former schoolboy athlete from North Yorkshire, dead in a sixth floor flat in Pattaya, a city popular with tourists, at 3am.

His face and chest were covered in cuts, police told local media. 

It is believed that he bled to death after severing an artery in his neck.

Mr Flannery's girlfriend, Janjira Buapae, 23, told police that she returned from work to their flat in the Spanish Place Pattay apartment complex to find Jason in what local media described as 'a serious discussion' with a friend and another woman.

Later, she said, Mr Flannery mixed cocaine with water and drank it, before smoking a spliff.

Ms Janjira said she rowed with her boyfriend and decided to leave the room. 

Mr Flannery pursued her into the hallway, according to reports, where their argument drew a crowd of onlookers.

Ms Janjira claimed Mr Flannery, alarmed by the crowd, ran back in to his flat and straight into a glass door. He fell down and died soon afterwards.

Sawang Boriboon rescue volunteers, Pattaya Police and Bang Lamung Hospital medics were called to the flat but Mr Flannery had already died from his wounds.

Mr Flannery, originally from Leyburn, North Yorkshire, was a former pupil at Wensleydale School, where he had won plaudits for his athleticism.

As a teenager he won the Yorkshire County AAA 1500m title, scored a hat-trick in five minutes with Richmond Town FC juniors team to secure the Cleveland Challenge Cup and was awarded the John Bowles Cup by his school for outstanding achievement in sport.

It is understood Mr Flannery had been living near the bay around which Pattaya's resort was developed in the 1960s.

His body has been sent for a post-mortem examination and the British Embassy, in Bangkok, was notified. It is understood police are not treating Mr Flannery's death, which happened on Saturday evening, as suspicious.

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said if the Royal Thai Police are not satisfied after a initial examination of the facts surrounding a death, they can request an autopsy.

He added: “We can confirm the death of a British national in Pattaya, Thailand on August 23.

“We are providing consular assistance to the family at this sad time.”
