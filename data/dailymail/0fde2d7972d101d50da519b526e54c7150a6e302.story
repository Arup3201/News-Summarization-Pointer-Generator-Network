An Opinium poll for the Daily Mail puts Nigel Farage's Ukip comfortably ahead of Labour, on 32 per cent to 25 per cent

UKIP are on course for an unprecedented victory in today’s European Parliament elections - despite Nigel Farage admitting he is ‘frazzled’  and cannot go on being the party’s dominant face.

An Opinium poll for the Daily Mail puts Ukip comfortably ahead of Labour, on 32 per cent to 25 per cent.

The Conservatives are on 21 per cent, with the Liberal Democrats battling the Greens for fourth place, each on a miserable 6 per cent.

Both Labour and the Conservatives appear reconciled to Ukip coming out on top, despite weeks of controversy over allegations of racism, homophobia and misogyny against the upstart party’s candidates.

David Cameron is ordering Tory troops to focus on a Westminster by-election in Newark early next month as an opportunity to halt the Ukip bandwagon.

Conservative strategists point to a sharp decline in Mr Farage’s personal ratings in recent weeks and compare him to a ‘shock jock’ radio host whose outbursts will not convince voters at a general election.

Labour officials, meanwhile, dismissed suggestions that failure to top the European poll would augur ill for their chances of winning power in 2015.

They insisted Ed Miliband will not bow to pressure from some Labour MPs to backtrack on his refusal to match the Conservatives’ promise of an in/out EU referendum, even if his party is beaten by Ukip.

Mr Farage said a Ukip victory in the European elections would represent a political ‘earthquake’ and repeated his willingness to do ‘a deal with the devil’ or make local pacts with MPs from other parties if it would help guarantee a referendum on Europe.

But he conceded the party would haemorrhage votes at next year’s general election unless it can persuade voters it is more than a ‘one-man band’.

The Ukip leader has blamed tiredness for his suggestion last week that everyone knows ‘the difference’ between Romanians and Germans. Mr Farage, whose second wife Kirsten is German, said he would not be happy if Romanians moved in next door.

‘Right at the moment I’m so frazzled after a month on the road,’ he told the Mail. ‘This has been relentless. I have been doing this damn hard, maybe too hard actually.

‘This must change; we cannot go into a general election with me being seen to be the dominant figure.’

Mr Cameron said only a Conservative government could deliver a reformed relationship with Brussels, with new controls on free movement and further restrictions on migrants’ benefits.

That would followed by an in/out referendum on Britain’s membership by the end of 2017.

The Prime Minister said: ‘I’m convinced that we will get the changes that we want and my aim is to secure Britain’s place in a reformed European Union.

‘But that’s the real choice at this election – you’ve got Labour and the Liberals who can’t see anything wrong with Europe and you’ve got Ukip who can’t see anything right with Europe and want to walk away.’

The Liberal Democrats are  preparing themselves to lose all of their MEPs in the European elections today, according to a leaked document advising top party figures on how to react to the defeat.

It reveals they have been advised to say they ‘expected’ to lose up to all of their 12 representatives in Strasbourg and to simply say they are ‘disappointed’.

The embarrassing memo, leaked to the Guardian newspaper, reveals that in the event of the party winning no seats, or just one or two, in the European elections, they should say: ‘Disappointed with the result but the party remains resolute and this was expected at this point in the electoral cycle.’

If the party clings on to two to three MEPs, senior Lib Dems have been advised to say it is ‘a good result considering the circumstances’.

And three and five seats should be billed as ‘a very encouraging result... much better than almost everyone predicted’.

In 2009, the Lib Dems won 11 seats and another defected to them a year later.

The internal document was presented to the Wheelhouse group, the body chaired by the Lib Dems’ general election co-ordinator Paddy Ashdown.
