A New Jersey man faces murder charges after allegedly bludgeoning both his girlfriend and her father to death inside their own house before cutting his own neck.

Dennis Pozniak, 27, faces two counts of murder in the deaths.

Police are still uncertain what his motive may have been to kill Nicole WIlson, 24, and her father, Bryan Wilson, 52. 

Dennis Pozniak, 27, can be seen with his apparently self-inflicted slashed across his throat. He was rescued by police and arrested on two counts of murder

Pozniak's girlfriend Nicole Wilson and her father  Bryan Wison were found bludgeoned to death at their home

Autopsies determined both died from head trauma sometime between Friday evening and early Saturday morning.

The Burlington County Times reports that he had been living with the family at their Washington Street home for months and that he was reportedly still dating the girl. 

Police were called to the home at 9 a.m. after an unidentified family member woke to discover the bodies, The Courier-Post reports. 

Pozniak was there at the time and had several cuts that were believed to be self-inflicted once treated at the hospital. 

'He's a normal kid and he had some problems,' uncle Gene Pozniak told reporters. 'Obviously he had problems, but I don't know the specific nature.'

He said he'd only met Nicole Wilson on one occasion.

'She seemed like a very nice person,' he said.

He was working at a Philadelphia sign and banners business after finishing school at Cinnaminson High.

He is being held on preliminary bail of $1 million at an undisclosed medical facility and will undergo a psychiatric evaluation. 

The couple's Facebook pages show they had been together since August.
