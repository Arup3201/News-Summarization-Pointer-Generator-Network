This is the amazing moment lumps of solid rock explode into the air as the earth sheds its outer layer in a strange geological phenomenon known as exfoliation.

The incident is one of a number of exfoliation events to have taken place in the last month in the Sierra Nevada range, eastern California,  damaging a nearby dam.

A local resident captured the moment and uploaded the strange event to YouTube where it has been viewed more than 615,000 times.

The solid granite rock can be seen moving as it is heated by the hot Californian sun 

Witnesses can see cracks developing while all around them there are popping sounds as the rock moves 

Exfoliation occurs in areas with 'igneous' rocks such as granite. 

The deep rock is under extremely high pressure, but as the surface layers are worn away due to normal erosion, the pressure is reduced.

If the rock is heated by strong sun light it will expand and then contract at night time. 

This mechanical process weakens the rock where it eventually cracks and even explodes in a spectacular fashion. 

According to the Twain Harte Lake Association the area suffered 'three natural rock stress release events' in August. 

A statement from the association said: 'These events resulted in fracturing of the existing granite rock dome that forms the left dam abutment. Fractures appear to be sheeting/exfoliation joints (similar to that of an onion layer peeling), relatively thin (approx. 1‐3 feet in thickness).'

As a result of the cracking, the nearby dam suffered a leak of about 40 gallons per minute which prompted safety officials to drain the lake while a survey could take place. 

Leanne Hughes, survey geologist with the British Geological Survey said the issue of exfoliating rock is not tremendously rare.

She said: 'It is unusual to see exfoliating rock captured on video but it is not very rare. It is caused when igneous rock such as granite is exposed to strong sunlight and dry conditions. Under the intense infra red rays the rock expands and then it contracts at night.

'This mechanical process weakens the rock until it reaches the point where it fails. This can happen in the UK but it is not very dangerous.'

Eventually a small puff of smoke warns that the rock is approaching its breaking point 

Then suddenly, large chunks of rock explode throwing dozens of fragments are thrown into the air
