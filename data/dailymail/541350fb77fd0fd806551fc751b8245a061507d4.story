It seems that her new older boyfriend is making an impact on Mary-Kate Olsen's life.

The 25-year-old ditched her grungy blonde hair just in time for the 2012 Council Of Fashion Designers Of America Fashion Awards which were held in New York last night.

In its place was a sleek blow-dry job that saw her newly-dyed brown locks take on a far more sophisticated look.

Then and now: Mary-Kate Olsen has ditched her grungy blonde locks, seen on May 25 at a basketball game in New York (left) for neat brunette locks at the CFDA Awards (right). She is dating Oliver Sarkozy, who is 42

The new look comes after recent news that the fashion designer is dating Olivier Sarkozy, the 42-year-old half brother of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy.

Her new brown hair was paired perfectly with green drop earrings which helped to bring out the designer's piercing green eyes.

It was an elegant look that proved fitting for the evening as she and her sister Ashley took out top honours at the event staged at Lincoln Center.

The pair behind The Row, their high-end fashion label, were named Womenswear Designers Of The Year at the ceremony.

Her new boyfriend, who is an asset manager, was not in attendance.

The pair had first been spotted cosying up court-side at Madison Square Gardens on April 25.

The Frenchman, who had been dressed in a lavender 
shirt and pink jumper, was caught stroking the young star's hair as they
watched the New York Knicks defeat the Los Angeles Clippers 99-93.

The affectionate snaps confirmed rumours of a romance between the pair, who are said to have been dating for several months. Â

The pair are 'head over heels' for one another and spent Memorial Day weekend together in the Hamptons, the New York Post reported.

Olivier, the managing director for Washington, D.C.-based asset managing firm the Carlyle Group, has previously been married.

After
he and his wife Charlotte, who have two children together, he dated 
actress Stella Schnabel for a year before their split in March.
