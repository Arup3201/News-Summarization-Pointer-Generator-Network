For centuries Cornwall has claimed the rights as the inventor of the traditional pasty.

Marketed as a savoury snack which derived from the mining days, the county has long been associated with the humble pasty.

But a historian has now threatened to upset the applecart by claiming to have found proof the traditional pasty was actually invented elsewhere - in the rivalling county of Devon.

Marketed as a savoury snack which derived from the mining days, Cornwall has long been associated with the pasty. However, a historian has thrown a spanner in the works after claiming it actually came from Devon

Dr Todd Gray claims four lines of texts in records dating back to the 16th Century prove the ‘world’s first pasty recipe’ was born in Plymouth, Devon – fuelling an ongoing food war between the two counties which already clash over the correct way to make a cream tea.   

He claims to have made the discovery after scouring the historic Audit Book and Receivers Accounts in Plymouth for clues as to the origin of the food.

He said one piece of text from records in 1509, refers to the financial cost of making a pasty and the recipe used - some 236 years before there was any record of pasties in Cornwall.

Traditionalists claim the pasty was originally made as lunch for Cornish tin miners who were unable to return to the surface to eat.

They were able to hold the pastry by the folded crust so the dirt didn’t touch the rest of their food, then discard that section afterwards.

Devon pasties tend to have a crimped crust running along the top and are oval in shape while Cornish pasties are semi-circular with a thicker crust running along the curved edge of the pasty.

The term 'Cornish pasty' was given protected status by the European Commission in 2011.

It states that only pasties made in Cornwall from a traditional recipe can marketed as a 'Cornish pasty'.

The Cornish Pasty Association applied for the special status, saying it wanted to protect the 'quality and reputation' of the pasty.

The Protected Geographical Indication status means 'genuine' Cornish pasties are stamped with a special logo.

The text, which says 'Itm for the cooke 
is labor to make the pasties', is said to be proof the West Country snack
 originated from Plymouth, which is separated from Cornwall by the River
 Tamar.

He said that while the intriguing text 
suggests inventors were using venison from the Mount Edgcumbe estate 
just across the Tamar Valley in Cornwall, it proves the pasty actually 
originated in Devon.

He said the first reference to pasties he
 could find at the Cornwall Record Office was dated 1746 - more than two centuries after the records were logged in Plymouth.

The findings have been published in a book - The Plymouth Book of Wonder – which features a collection of 100 ‘quirky and fascinating nuggets’ designed to attract visitors to the city.

It has sparked a war of words between the two counties, which continue to dispute which way around cream and jam should be spread on the traditional cream tea.

Jo Hartop, of the Cornish Pasty Association, said: ‘We produce the traditional Cornish pasty.

‘The historical books say that the pasty originated in Cornwall, but obviously there is lots of information out there.

‘If you talk to consumers, which is what matters the most - they say it originated in Cornwall.’

Dr Todd Gray claims to have found proof the traditional pasty was actually invented in Plymouth, Devon with records from the city, dating back to 1509 (above), apparently referring to the financial cost of making a pasty

Some Devonians claim the evidence is conclusive that the pasty - which makes Cornwall more than £60 million a year – originated in Plymouth.

However, Nigel Eadie, owner of the Original Pasty House in Plymouth, conceded that pasties would always be more closely associated with Cornwall.

He said: ‘Everyone would associate the origins of a pasty with Cornwall - it’s a Cornish pasty.

‘There are variations in terms of the styles that are made in Devon.

‘I don’t think it’s a big problem, it’s not really going to affect people’s decision about whether or not to buy a pasty.

‘It’s an interesting fact that will make the book even more fascinating if you’re living in Plymouth.

‘It’s a nice little feather in the cap of Plymothians to say that really the pasty actually originated in Plymouth.'

The Cornish claim the jam should be spread first on the scone, while those in Devon claim cream should always come first

A battle has raged for years over the origins of the cream
tea, with both Devon and Cornwall claiming to be the real birthplace of the
tradition.

And while the dispute continues to wager on, both counties remain
divided over the ‘right’ way to load up the quintessentially British afternoon
treat.

In Devon, the scone is split into two and loaded with large
helpings of locally-sourced clotted cream before a dollop of jam is placed on
top.

Meanwhile, the Cornish believe the proper way to serve a
scone is to first spread the jam before finishing it with a blob of clotted
cream.

The age-old debate has rumbled on for years, with both
counties attempting to justify their method as correct.

Some say the Cornish way helps the cream stay on without
sliding off, while Devonians defend their method by claiming it allows more
cream to be spread on the scone.
