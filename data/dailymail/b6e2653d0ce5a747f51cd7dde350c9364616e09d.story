Anthony Waters, 48, killed himself moments after British Gas workers turned up and switched off the electricity at his store

A shopkeeper struggling with debts killed himself moments after British Gas workers turned up and switched off the electricity at his store.

Anthony Waters, 48, told the workmen he could give them £1,000 of his £5,000 debt.

But despite him warning he would hang himself, and telling them he ‘had the rope ready’ they insisted they must ‘de-energise’ the store, an inquest heard. He then closed the shutters and locked up his shop.

The 
British Gas team dismissed his comments as an ‘idle threat’ but called 
the police from outside the store just in case, the inquest in Bradford 
was told. Mr Waters was later found dead inside by police officers.

Yesterday the energy giant was condemned by Mr Waters’s father for ‘bullying’ his son into committing suicide.

 Waters said: ‘I think Anthony felt he had let us down. He was pushed to
 the point of desperation by a big corporation bullying him because it 
couldn’t give a bit of leeway to a single man struggling and he was 
pushed over the edge. I think it is disgusting.

‘I’m
 sure they could have arranged for another payment scheme if things were
 getting that bad. I don’t understand why British Gas had to send three 
men to his shop without any warning. It was a bit heavy-handed and these
 companies forget the human side of things. Where is their humanity?’

Mr Waters senior, 87, set up Waters Mini-Mart in Bradford, West Yorkshire, in 1969. The family built up a commercial property portfolio using a £300,000 bank loan. But they hit financial problems and three of their shops had to be closed.

Anthony reopened the general store last February and ‘things were on the mend’, until the bank called in the loan and British Gas demanded payment for the electricity bills.

The firm said that although Mr Waters was not told the date supplies would be cut off, there had been two years of discussions before their visit. Mr Waters would also have been told they were getting a court warrant to disconnect his electricity.

David Pickard, a British Gas warrant officer, arrived with a locksmith and an engineer at 9am on July 22.

Mr Pickard said he discussed the situation with Mr Waters before the electricity was cut off, adding: ‘He clearly felt he should have been given more time to pay.’ Referring to Mr Waters’s threat to hang himself, he said: ‘I thought it was just a throwaway comment, an idle threat. In my line of work I hear people say it quite regularly and think nothing of it.’

He added that he believed the shopkeeper was ‘trying to make us feel sorry for him so we would not go ahead’.

The British Gas workers waited until police arrived, who asked the locksmith to pick the lock so they could get inside.

Sarah Bland, who runs a hair salon next to the shop and rented her property from the family, saw Mr Waters as he locked up the shop, looking flushed and holding a green bin bag. ‘I said “are you shut” and he said “yes, shut for good.” I believe there must have been a rope in the bag when I saw him,’ she said.

Recording a suicide verdict, coroner Oliver Longstaff said Mr Waters had been ‘put on the spot’ by the British Gas team.

‘He was a man who had done his best for a long time to keep the family business, which he took great pride in, in good health,’ he said. ‘He realised he couldn’t do that for any longer and took a view that all that was left was to end his life.’

British Gas spokesman Leonie Edwards said: ‘We were very saddened by the death of Mr Waters and we would like to express our sincere sympathies to his family.’
