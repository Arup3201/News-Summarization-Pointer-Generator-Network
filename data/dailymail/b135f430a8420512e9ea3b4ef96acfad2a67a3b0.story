Tattooed hair: Noah Farris, 32, was charged with attempted murder and being an accessory in a shooting near Santa Monica College on Tuesday

A gang member with a distinctly threatening look including a head of entirely tattooed-on hair has been charged with murder along with two others, in connection with a shooting in Santa Monica earlier this week.

Noah Farris, 32, with the unusual hairstyle was charged with being an accessory to murder whilst two other men, Christopher Osumi, 19, Meliton Lopez, 23, face more serious charges of murder.

Around 8:15 a.m. on Tuesday morning, Osumi allegedly used a handgun to open fire on two men standing in Michigan Avenue, shooting both victims multiple times.

Santa Monica resident Gil Verastegui, 29, later died.

Prosecutors planned to ask that bail be set atÂ  $3 million each for Osumi and Lopez and $500,000 for Farris.

Police say the men were arrested less than an hour after the shooting on Tuesday thanks to descriptions provided by witnesses.

The attack was city's third shooting incident in five days and followed a rampage in Santa Monica last Friday that left six people dead, including the gunman.

There was no indication that the two incidents were related, police said.
