Mauricio Pochettino is ready to walk away from Southampton in the summer after hiring a team of lawyers to study the fine print in his contract.

Pochettino was talked into staying at the club until the end of the season during an emotional meeting with the club’s former executive chairman, Nicola Cortese, on Wednesday evening.

The highly regarded Southampton manager, who is trying to prepare for Saturday’s clash at Sunderland, admitted he will make a decision on his future at the end of the season.

Southampton’s owner Katharina Liebherr, now non-executive chairman at St Mary’s, met Pochettino for five minutes after training.

She is considering whether to promote Les Reed from football development director to the prominent first-team position of sporting director.

Cortese, who intends to return to St Mary’s as chairman of another Barclays Premier League club, faces a massive compensation battle with Liebherr. Although, technically, he resigned, the Liebherr family are still negotiating a settlement.

Pochettino, who has less than 18 months left on the deal he signed in January 2013, said: ‘I am a loyal person and a legal person.

‘I thought about many things and I did not sleep well. I am 100 per cent decided to stay here until the end of the season.

‘We will see what happens at the end of the season and not before. Then we will assess the situation and decide whether I am up to staying here for another season.

‘It is difficult. When you become manager, you have a big commitment to the club, the fans, the players, the staff. It is a huge responsibility.’

Pochettino insisted none of his players had asked to leave in the wake of Cortese’s departure.

Luke Shaw, the left back valued at £30million by Southampton, may demand to go as Manchester City and Chelsea prepare to fight it out for him.

Pochettino said: ‘Luke Shaw has a contract and that is a question for the new chairman.’

The club were in talks with West Ham over the £7miilion sale of Rickie Lambert, but that move stalled when Cortese resigned.

Pochettino said no player would leave unless he decided it would benefit the club.

He is deeply upset by what has happened. He said: ‘I want to show my complete gratitude to Nicola Cortese. He believed in me and my staff and our families are full of gratitude.

‘Eight months ago when we were speaking about things I said there would be no sense for me to stay but it is a different situation now. Nicola knows about my decision to stay.’
