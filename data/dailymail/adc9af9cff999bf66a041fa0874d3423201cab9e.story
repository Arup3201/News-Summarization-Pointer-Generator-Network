He’s the squeaky clean star of Disney’s High School Musical, so Zac Efron’s fans will be shocked to hear how he secretly completed a stint in rehab five months ago. 

According to TMZ, the 25-year-old actor quietly checked into a treatment facility to deal with a cocaine problem, and a source adds that he also experimented with MDMA - the active ingredient in Ecstasy tablets, which is known as 'Molly' on the street.

Zac is now said to be healthy and happy and is focusing on his movie career as he attempts to move on with his life.

Keeping his head down: Zac pictured in April - at around the same time he is believed to have entered rehab for the second time

A source told E! News: ‘He's healthy, happy and not drinking. He's taking time to focus on working.’

An insider also told People: ‘He’s doing great. He's taking care of himself and it shows.’

However, it has been reported that prior to entering rehab, Zac's addiction had been causing issues in his movie career.

According to TMZ, Zac allegedly missed several days of filming while shooting Seth Rogen's new fraternity comedy Neighbors back in April.

A film source told the site: 'It was common knowledge he was struggling with cocaine.'

TMZ also claimed that Zac and a group of friends caused around $50,000 of damage in their room at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas during a cocaine-fulled party.

While Zac hasn’t commented on the rehab 
reports, he told reporters at the Toronto International Film Festival 
recently: 'I'm good, real good.'

The news of the stint in the treatment facility will come as a shock to Zac’s fans as the actor has mainly stayed away from the party scene, apart from one well publicised visit to a strip club back in 2010.

While Zac admitted that he went to Flash Dancers Gentlemen's Club in New York with High School Musical co-star Corbin Bleu, he insisted he had received permission from his then-girlfriend Vanessa Hudgens before the boys’ night out.

‘The hardest part is calling your girlfriend before,' he said on US late-night chat show Jimmy Kimmel Live!

'It's like, how do you even start that conversation without feeling like an a**hole?'

When Kimmel asked how Vanessa responded, Zac hesitated for a while before saying: 'She was fine with it.'

He went on to say that it wasn't exactly what he expected, telling the host: 'I had this image of what it'd be like.

'Healthy, happy and not drinking': Sources say Zac is concentrating on his career after rehab

'I've heard a lot about these places, mostly from rap music - they're supposed to be pretty reputable!'

He added: 'So I envisioned myself in a 
nice couch with stunner shades with T-Pain and Usher making it rain 
money! And it just wasn't like that.'

Otherwise, Zac has maintained a low profile and is not usually spotted out partying like his young Hollywood contemporaries.

Zac will next appear on the big screen in Parkland, about the days surrounding President Kennedy's death in Dallas in 1963.

Relapse: Zac Efron is said to sought help for his cocaine addiction a second time after suffering a relapse while shooting new comedy Neighbors back in April

Efron plays Jim Carrico, the real-life doctor who battled to save JFK at Parkland Memorial Hospital after he was shot.

He also recently shot Are We Officially Dating? alongside Imogen Poots, and Neighbors with Dave Franco.

MailOnline has contacted Efron's representatives for comment.
