Stamp duty on all homes that cost more than £2million will soar to seven per cent from tonight, George Osborne announced in a tax grab on the wealthy.

A new 15 per cent tax will also be imposed on all properties over £2million which are bought via a company in an attempt to close a loophole.

Mr Osborne said the clampdown on stamp duty avoidance will help raise five times more than the 50p tax which 'may raise nothing at all'.

The Chancellor added that the Government will consult on a 'mansion tax' - an annual charge on properties worth at least £2million - in a concession to the Liberal Democrats

New rate: Homes such as these will be subject to the new rate. The move comes just 12 months after the introduction of a 5 per cent band on homes bought for more than £1m

The seven per cent tax will mean a 
minimum tax contribution of £140,000 by someone buying a residential 
house costing £2m or more.

The move comes just 12 months after the introduction of a 5 per cent band on homes bought for more than £1m.

The new rate will allow the 
Government to milk high-end wealth particularly in expensive enclaves of
London, appealing to 'squeezed middle' voters.

However, estate agents have warned the raid on £2million plus homes could hit all homeowners and buyers by triggering a slowdown in the areas of the property market which have been vital to supporting prices.

They said the Chancellor risks 'killing 
the goose that lays the golden egg' at a time when much of the housing 
market remains flat elsewhere.

Mr Osborne told the House of Commons that he was determined to crackdown on property tax avoidance - and close a loophole that has allowed wealthy homeowners to dodge stamp duty by placing their properties in overseas tax shelters.

Clampdown: Mr Osborne unveiled a crackdown on Stamp Duty tax avoidance in his budget today

The average asking price in one 
exclusive corner of London, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea,
hit £2m for the first time this week.

A
decade ago, the average asking price in the area was just £650,000.

Those paying the new rate of stamp duty now face bills of at least 
£140,000 if the new 7% rate is implemented.

Before 1997 they would have paid little more than £20,000 
because stamp duty was a flat 1 per cent.

There are thought to be around 80,000 homes in Britain worth £2million or more.

The price of homes such as those in London's most expensive boroughs has shot up in recent years, partly due to an influx of foreign wealth.

Throughout the capital, average prices were typically £455,159, up 7.3% year-on-year.

Overall Britain is set for a house price boom, a Bank of England expert predicted yesterday.

Demand will rise as a result of our ageing population, an influx of immigrants and a record low in the number of new houses being built.

More than £100billion of property in 
central London alone has been placed offshore beyond the reach of the 
taxman, costing the nation billions in lost revenue.

The Chancellor said: 'If you buy a property in Britain 
that is used for residential purposes, then we will expect stamp duty to
be paid. That is the clear intention of Parliament.

'I will not hesitate to move swiftly,
without notice and retrospectively if inappropriate ways around these 
new rules are found. People have been warned.'

He added: 'It is fair when 
money is tight, and so many families could do with help, that those 
buying the most expensive homes contribute more.

'From midnight tonight, we will introduce a new Stamp Duty Land Tax rate of 7 per cent on properties worth more than £2 million.'

A Land Registry inventory of 18,700 
title deeds shows that in some areas of London more than one in 20 
properties are owned offshore. The dodge has spread across the country, 
with Manchester, Leeds, Derby and even Torbay among the locations for 
properties held in tax havens.

The
schemes enable the rich to avoid stamp duty, as long as they are not 
resident or domiciled here for tax. Their heirs also avoid inheritance 
tax, charged at 40 per cent.

Experts
say the loophole is cheating the Treasury out of up to £500million a 
year in stamp duty and as much as £1.3billion in inheritance tax.

Mr Osborne said that the crackdown on avoidance and new taxes on the wealthy would raise five times more than the 50p tax which brought in just £1bn a year.

It is being replaced with a 45p tax.

He said: 'No Chancellor can justify a tax rate that damages our economy and raises next to nothing. It is as simple as that.

'And thanks to the other new taxes on the rich I've announced today, we'll be getting five times more money each and every year from the wealthiest in our society.

'So the richest pay more. The economy benefits. Britain is competitive again.'

Today's move will avoid a costly 
general revaluation of homes across the country that would have been 
required if the Lib Dem's 'mansion tax' or annual levy was implemented.

Peter Rollings, chief executive of 
estate agent Marsh and Parsons, said the new stamp duty band could hit 
the property market at all levels.

'Not only will this policy 
disproportionately target London, where house prices are in a league of 
their own, it risks killing the goose that lays the golden egg.

'With the property market still far 
from healthy, we need to see the Government supporting activity at all 
levels, rather adding yet another tax burden.'

London homes have been vital in 
keeping average prices up, with the capital often viewed as the most 
'healthy' and stable area at a time when the housing market generally 
remains weak and patchy.

Statistics from the Land Registry show that the new top rate of stamp duty will overwhelmingly hit London buyers.

In November – the latest month for 
which figures are available – 121 homes were bought for more than 
£2million in England and Wales and 98 of these were in London.

The thresholds: How Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) hits housebuyers

Money raised by the new stamp duty 
level will be used to plug the £3bn gap in public finances as the 
Chancellor also announces a rise in the income tax base threshold to 
£9,205.

Mr Osborne’s stamp duty shake-up arrives just a few days before first-time buyers lose a generous exemption from the tax.

The
two-year holiday, which was introduced by Labour’s Alistair Darling in 
his final Budget, covered properties worth up to £250,000.

The
7 per cent stamp duty band is a watered-down version of Liberal 
Democrat plans for a mansion tax – pushed by Business Secretary Vince 
Cable yesterday.

The National Association of Estate Agents said the Government had missed an opportunity to completely overhaul the 'outdated' stamp duty system, a tax which is seen as causing distortions in the market.

NAEA president Wendy Evans-Scott said: 'To reinvigorate this struggling market will require specific stimulus across the entire housing spectrum to help people buy and sell homes, not further penalties on those able to do so.'

Former NAEA president Trevor Kent said every homeowner would be hit by the new top-end tax, with 70 per cent of first-time buyers relying on the progression of a 'chain' of sales.

He said: 'Higher stamp duty always results in property price pressure, in this scenario there is little doubt that prices will fall across the board. Some may think ‘great’, but mortgage lenders will not - they rely on the expectation of a gentle long-term rise to safeguard their loans.'

Mr Kent predicted that lenders would generally start demanding higher deposits to protect themselves if prices dipped.
