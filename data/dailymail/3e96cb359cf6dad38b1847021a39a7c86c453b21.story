An Australian architecture and interior design company has pushed the boundaries of apartment development by creating convertible pads of the future.

The nationwide firm Rothelowman, which has offices in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, is championing the innovative design.

With the price of city apartments blowing up in Melbourne, buyers are looking at smaller, affordable, more compact living spaces and this firm believes it has found the perfect solution to the shortage.

The convertible apartment can be adjusted to your preference and depending on what configuration you adjust it to, it does or doesn’t have to have a bedroom.

The firm was inspired by Japanese interior design where moving walls are used to completely redesign whole apartment in a number of minutes.

Rothelowman has drawn up the designs for a new development with is now under construction at Abbotsford in Victoria.

The new apartments will feature pull-down beds and movable walls to enable residents to change their apartment to suit their needs

The apartments are currently being built as a gateway to the Victoria East Precinct.

According to Rothelowman, the project will ‘raise the standard for excellence in large scale inner city urban housing developments.’

The new apartments will feature pull-down beds and movable walls to enable residents to change their apartment to suit their needs.

A one-bedroom apartment can easily be changed into a studio pad for a party at the drop of the hat.

The feature wall, which moves around the apartment, contains a television unit, a kitchen with fridge, bedroom robes and even bedside tables

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Rothelowman principal Chris Hayton said it was extremely important for the firm to perfect the mechanics of the movable walls or people would not buy into it.

The feature wall, which moves around the apartment, contains a television unit, a kitchen with fridge, bedroom robes and even bedside tables.

It also includes a huge pull-down queen size bed and a lot of storage so the room is easily transformed.

“If you don’t provide a solution in the bedroom space and every nook and crank has storage in it, so that the alarm clock doesn’t have to moved, if it is going to take you five minutes to pack everything up you are never going to do it.

“If all you have to do is fold the bed up and everything else is already in a place where it is concealed and everything can be moved for the wall to slide there is a much better chance that people will move the wall more frequently. Mr Hayton said.
