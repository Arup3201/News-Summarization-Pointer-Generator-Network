If you’re baring your legs this summer, spare a thought for bin men who have been banned from wearing shorts.

Despite temperatures reaching 20C, Stoke-on-Trent City council chiefs say staff can’t wear the shorts which were issued last year.

They claim ditching trousers would create a health and safety risk and say the NHS would need to declare a health warning - with temperatures averaging 30C - for shorts to be worn.

Hot: Bin men have been banned from wearing shorts by Stoke-on-Trent City Council, despite the mercury hitting 20C

Council staff and union representatives dismissed the ruling as ‘ridiculous’.

One council worker said: ‘Last year we were given the option of having one pair of shorts as part of our uniform.

‘A lot of people took this up but now we have been refused permission to wear shorts because it's not hot enough.

Former bin man and GMB union rep Alan Joynson said: ‘It is ridiculous, I have never heard anything like it. When it is warm, as long as they are wearing the right foot-ware in case they drop bins, I don't see a problem.’

A letter was sent by the council stating that staff, which include bin men, gardeners and street cleaners, can only wear shorts if they have authorisation and the weather is ‘extreme.’

Risk: Council gardeners have also been stopped from baring their legs because council chiefs reckon they present a health and safety threat

Councillor Duncan Walker, who is a member of the GMB union, said: ‘I don't have any problem with them wearing shorts; they are out in all weathers and they need to be comfortable.’

But his fellow Councillor Andy Platt said it was up to council bosses to decided when staff can wear shorts.

He said: ‘The shorts are only worn during spells of extremely hot weather and our managers will decide when it is appropriate to wear them.’

Protection: The council said workers had to cover up to protect themselves from injury

‘Our staff turn out in all kinds of weather to carry out hard physical work around the city. Making sure they feel comfortable and valued at work is good for the council and good for the city too.’

A council spokesperson said workers’ legs needed to be covered up to protect them.

‘The trousers are designed to protect them from sharp objects, flying glass, thorns and other hazards they may encounter during their day-to-day work, such as discarded needles.

‘Our main priority is protecting our workers from harm, because it would be unforgiveable if we put them in danger, but unfortunately the shorts offer little protection against injury.

‘The only reason we would let staff wear shorts is if we received warnings from other agencies, such as the Met Office or the NHS, that the weather was hot enough to pose a health risk. There is no trigger temperature involved - we just use common sense and listen to expert advice.

‘We have to weigh up the risks and decide whether the heatwave danger outweighs the need for workers to protect their lower legs from injury.

‘We're one of the few councils that allow staff to wear shorts at work, and it was very popular with the staff when we tried it out during last summer's spell of extreme hot weather.’
