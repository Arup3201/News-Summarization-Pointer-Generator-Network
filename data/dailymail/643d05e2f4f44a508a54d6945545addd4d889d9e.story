Stabbed: Neil Tulley, 54, died from multiple wounds shortly after police discovered arrived at the house in Guildford

A 14-year-old boy has appeared in court charged with murdering a man who was found stabbed to death in Guildford.

Neil Tulley, 54, was discovered covered in blood in a house in Guildford, Surrey, just after 10am on Tuesday.

Police had been responding to a 999 call in a house Cedar Way in the Bellfields area.

Paramedics tried to save Mr Tulley's life but he was pronounced dead a short while later.

A post-mortem examination found he died from multiple stab wounds.

Police launched a murder investigation in the wake of Mr Tulley's death, and instigated a major manhunt for a 14-year-old boy and a 22-year-old man.

The pair later handed themselves in at a nearby police station.

The 14-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared at North Surrey Magistrates' Court today charged with murder, Surrey Police said.

He has been remanded into the care of social services and is due to appear at Guildford Crown Court on Tuesday.

A 22-year-old man who was also arrested on suspicion of murder is undergoing treatment for injuries sustained before his arrest.

He remains under police guard in hospital.

A 49-year-old woman held suspected of murder was this week freed on police bail and is due to return to Woking Police Station on August 29.

A boy, aged 16 years, was also arrested on suspicion of murder, but was released with no further action taken.

Mr Tulley's grieving family were said yesterday to be too upset to speak about his death.
