The Australian government has dedicated $89.9 million in the 2014 budget to continue the search for MH370 in the southern Indian Ocean.

The money follows government fears the mammoth search effort could continue for another two years, with the current exhaustive operation failing to uncover any sign of the doomed plane.

The government also announced that $27.9 million would be given to the Defence Department to pay for its activities up to June 30 2014 in searching for the lost aircraft.

Another $2 million will be spent on the Joint Agency Coordination Centre, which was established on March 30 to oversee the hunt.

Australian federal budget announced: Treasurer Joe Hockey included funding for the hunt of missing Malaysian Airline Flight MH370 on Tuesday

'The government will provide up to $89.9 million over two years from 2013-14 as part of Australia's commitment to the search for Malaysia Airlines flight MH370,' budget papers stated.

'Further funding of up to $60 million over two years from 2013-14 will be provided to the Australian Transport Safety Bureau for Australia's contribution to the next phase of the search.'

The announcement follows news MH370 searchers have said electronic 'pings' initially thought to have come from missing Malaysian Airlines flight may not have emanated from the plane at all.

A senior Australian naval officer said he 'increasingly suspects' some of the signals detected last month didn't come from the jetliner's black-box flight recorders, piling further doubts over the search effort.

Australian naval Commander James Lybrand said of four 'pings' picked up by the U.S. Navy's Bluefin-21 autonomous underwater vehicle, two were too weak to have been from a man-made device.

Sonar 'pings': U.S. Navy's Bluefin-21 autonomous underwater vehicle, that picked up the signals last month, is lowered into the Indian Ocean once more

Too
 weak: A total of four signals, two on Saturday April 5 and two on Tuesday April 8, were detected by the Australian ship Ocean Shield in the 
search for flight MH370. But two of them now appear to have been too weak to
 have been from a man-made devic 

Search teams picked up two signals on April 5 at a frequency of 33.5kHz before two more were received three days later at 27kHz.

While both are significantly lower than the 37.5kHz frequency black box beacons are designed to emit, the April 5 signals are still possible, down perhaps to weakening batteries or the 'vagaries of deep-sea conditions'.

Cmdr Lybrand, captain of the Ocean Shield vessel, said: 'As far as frequency goes, between 33 kHz and 27 kHz is a pretty large jump.'

He did say the authorities still believe that the two April 5 signals, one of which was held for 2 hours and 20 minutes - are consistent with black-box locator beacons.

So what was it? Dolphins can produce echolocation signals of anywhere between 0.2kHz and 150kHz to obtain sonic information about their environment

Cmdr Lybrand did not give any clues as to what may have emitted the April 8 'pings' if they did not indeed come from MH370.

Dolphins can produce echolocation signals of anywhere between 0.2kHz and 150kHz to obtain sonic information about their environment.

Experts say dolphins' lower frequency vocalizations (between about 0.2 and 50kHz) are likely used in social communication while higher frequency clicks (40 to 150 kHz) are primarily used for spacial awareness.

Days after the signals were detected, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said he was 'very confident' they were from the 
black box on MH370.

'We have very much narrowed down the search area...and we are very confident the signals are from the black box from MH370,' he said.

'We have a series of detections, some lasting for quite a long period of time.

'We're now getting to the stage from where the black box is starting to fade. We're hoping to get as much information as we can before the signal finally expires.

'I really don't want to give any more information than that at this stage...as a sign of respect to the Chinese people and their families.'
