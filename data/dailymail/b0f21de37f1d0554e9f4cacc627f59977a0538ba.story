West Ham striker Andy Carroll surprised fiance Billi Mucklow with her very own secret beauty salon on Christmas Day.

Former TOWIE star Mucklow took to Instagram to show off the parlour called 'Billutifuls', which she apparently had no idea was in her new home. 

'Biggest shock of my life. Secret key, lead to a secret room to my new house! My very own salon called "Billutifuls". I love you so much @andytcarroll I'm one lucky girl #mirrormirroronthewall.'

With a snap of the pair sat on their pink sofa, she added: 'Our first Christmas in our new home.'

It is the latest hair-raising experience for Mucklow, after Carroll showed off his flowing locks by striking a pose with his fiance underneath the pair's mirrored ceiling.

The 25-year-old centre forward captioned that snap: 'Good morning from our new home!! #crazyhair #dirtymirror.' 

The pair started dating in the summer of 2013 but managed to keep their relationship under wraps until February 2014.
