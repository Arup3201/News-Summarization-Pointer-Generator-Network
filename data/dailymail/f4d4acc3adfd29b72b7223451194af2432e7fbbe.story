Greece was teetering on the brink of political and economic meltdown last night as attempts to form a coalition government collapsed.

Fears increased that the country could fall into the hands of extremists after anti-austerity fascists and communists polled strongly in Sunday’s General Election.

Conservative New Democracy leader Antonio Samaras, whose party took the largest share of the vote, 19 per cent, admitted he could not form a new administration.

‘We did everything we could but it was impossible,’ he said.

Samaras had been given three days to form a coalition after Sunday’s vote. Any hopes disappeared within 24 hours.

The political vacuum could now be filled by the extreme Left-wing party Syriza or the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn, both of which bitterly oppose austerity measures.

Syriza was the second-largest party at the polls, gaining 17 per cent, and now has three days to form a coalition.

Its leader Alexis Tsipras called the EU bailout of Greece a ‘tragedy’ and Sunday’s election an ‘anti-austerity vote’.

He has said he wants to lead a coalition of the Left and could talk to the leaders of the Centre-Left party Pasok, which was in power when Greece first negotiated a £88billion bailout in 2010.

It won just over 13 per cent of the votes at Sunday’s election.

Should Tsipras fail to form a coalition after three days, the mandate will then go to Pasok. If the deadlock is not resolved three days after that, then the country will face new elections under a caretaker government in mid-June.

In total, more than six in ten Greeks voted against austerity measures. Lurking in the background is Golden Dawn, which won 7 per cent of the vote.

Turmoil: Supporters of the Left Coalition party applaud as they watch exit polls last night. However, the two governing parties will fall two seats short of winning an overall majority

Its leader Nikolaos Michaloliakos yesterday warned: ‘The time for fear has come – we are coming.’He said his party, whose supporters wave flags which look like swastikas, would spearhead gains for the far Right across Europe.

‘Greece is only the beginning,’ he told a press conference yesterday in which Greek journalists were forced by shaven-headed supporters of the party to stand up as he entered the room.

Since the last general election three years ago, the party has capitalised on fears that illegal immigration is out of control.

It blames foreigners for thefts, prostitution and drug dealing, and in some areas escorts pensioners on shopping trips to prevent them being mugged.

The country now faces weeks of political turmoil after no party won enough votes to govern alone in the general election.

Stock markets plunged almost seven per cent yesterday amid the uncertainty as the leader tried in vain to form a Coalition.

The stock market fell 6.6 per cent this afternoon as the uncertain result raised fears that Greece could ultimately be forced to pull out of the eurozone.

Before his failure to form a coalition Mr Samaras had said: 'I understand the rage of the people, but our party will not leave Greece ungoverned.'

If a government cannot be formed, a new election will be held in mid-June as the country is forced to outline how they will push through 14.5billion euros (£11.7bn) worth of cuts.

Greece is also due to receive a 30billion euro (£24.2bn) loan from the eurozone and IMF in June so it can continue to meet its debt repayments.

If aid is cut off, analysts at Commerzbank estimated, the country would have trouble paying its debts by autumn.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Athens would still be expected to live up to its agreements.'Of course the most important thing is that the programs we agreed with Greece are continued,' she said.

Her remarks were echoed by a European Commission spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj Tardio, who stressed the need for 'full and timely implementation' of Greece's agreement with its international creditors and underlined that 'solidarity is a two-way street.'

Analyst Vangelis Agapitos said protracted instability would threaten the country's eurozone membership.

Greece's debt inspectors - the eurozone, IMF and European Central Bank, collectively known as the troika - could turn the screws by halting release of the bailout funds until Athens moves forward with its pledged reforms.

'Europe can live without Greece but I don't think Greece can live without Europe,' he said. 'If the troika is bluffing, Greece will remain in the euro. But if the troika says: "I can negotiate, but first show me some progress," Greece has no progress to display right now.'

'If the troika rattles our bars, then either the people will come to their senses at the next elections or the country will enter an alternative course, and when we open that door we will see what kind of chaos - or paradise - lies behind.'

The big election winner was the anti-bailout Radical Left Coalition, or Syriza, who took second place with 16.8 per cent of the vote - giving them 52 seats.

Pasok, which has spent 21 years in 
government since 1981 and stormed to victory with more than 43 per cent 
in 2009, saw its support slashed to about 13.5 per cent. It will have 
just 41 seats, compared to 160 in the last election.

Pasok and New Democracy saw their 
support plummet to the lowest level since 1974, when Greece emerged from
 a seven-year dictatorship.

The outcome showed widespread public 
anger at the harsh austerity measures imposed over the past two years in
 return for rescue loans from other European Union countries and the 
International Monetary Fund.

Neo-Nazis: Supporters of the extreme far right Golden Dawn party, all dressed in black shirts, brandish flares in the Greek port city of Thessaloniki last night

The neo-Nazi Golden Dawn movement - who 
secured 7 per cent of the vote - has been blamed for violent attacks on 
immigrants and ran on an anti-immigrant platform, vowing to 'clean up' 
Greece and calling for land mines to be planted along the country's 
borders.

Their 21 seats in parliament marks a stunning rise for a group that earned just 0.29 per cent of the vote in 2009.

Turnout stood at just over 64 per cent
 - a low figure for the country, where voting is officially compulsory, 
although no sanctions are applied for not casting a ballot.
