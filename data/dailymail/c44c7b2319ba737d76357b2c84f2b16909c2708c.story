A grandmother has been driven out of her own home after vandals smashed up tiles to remove a large part of her roof in the latest of a string of incidents against her property.

Joyce Faulkner, 62, said she is now too scared to stay in her Greater Manchester home, which is cold, wet and unlivable due to the vandalism.

The damage is just the latest in a string of harassment incidents at the Davenport house which has seen Joyce make 50 reports to the police over the last two years.

Grandmother Joyce Faulkner has been forced to stay with friends after being driven out of her home by vandals who removed large tiles from her roof in the early hours of New Year's Day

Ms Faulkner said she can no longer live at her Greater Manchester home because, as well as being scared, the vandalised roof causes rain to pour in

Within the last 24 months, she has reported smashed windows, grass on her lawn being poisoned, animal carcasses being left on her doorstep and her car being damaged.

Yet despite her suffering, nobody has been prosecuted in connection with the bizarre occurrences.

The latest incident has left the grandmother-of-two staying at friends’ homes fretting over what may happen next.

She said: 'I heard banging on the roof and slates crashing down, I just barricaded myself in and called the police - it was terrifying.

'Anyone can get in the house now, I go back to check on the house but only in the day - I’m too scared to go at night, especially now part of the roof is missing.

'I just can’t live there, I feel so scared and can’t eat or sleep. I’m always looking over my shoulder, it has become a way of life. Currently I am moving from one friend’s house to another.'

The roof, which was dismantled in the early hours of New Year’s Day, will have to be repaired once Joyce has given details to her insurance company.

Ms Faulkner, 62, who has four children and two grandchildren, is currently staying with friends while the roof of her home is repaired and because she claims she is too scared to return on her own

The latest incident comes after Ms Faulkner made 50 calls to police to report vandalism at her home. In the last two years she has reported her car windscreen being smashed, above, animal carcasses being left on her doorstep and the grass on her front lawn being poisoned

As well as the police, the mother-of-four has also reported the incidents to the council’s anti-social behaviour team and had CCTV installed at her property.

But she says neither the police or council are taking the harassment, which started with an egg being thrown at her window in February 2012, seriously enough.

However, Sergeant Gareth Davis said Greater Manchester Police was aware of the incidents.

He said: 'It is understandably distressing and we naturally have a lot of sympathy.

The grandmother-of-two has previously reported to police that the grass on the front lawn of her Davenport home was poisoned. She said she is now too scared to return to her home and is fretting over what may happen next

'Officers have been working to bring about a peaceful conclusion and have followed up on all reported incidents to find out who is responsible.

'There are numerous factors which contribute to these incidents and officers continue to review all the evidence to take the most appropriate action.'

A Stockport Council spokesman said: 'Stockport Council, police and other agencies have worked closely with Ms Faulkner to resolve the issue, progressing different solutions.

'We will continue to do this.'
