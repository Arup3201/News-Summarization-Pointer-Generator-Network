Gemma Simpson, who has not seen since 2000. A 44-year-old was detained on Tuesday night in connection with the disappearance of the 23-year-old

A 44-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a woman who went missing more than 14 years ago.

Gemma Simpson, 23, from Leeds, disappeared in May 2000.

She told a friend she was catching a bus from the Harehills area of Leeds to the city centre but vanished.

West Yorkshire Police have confirmed a man has been arrested in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and a property is being searched in the seaside town.

Detective Chief Inspector Adrian Taylor, from West Yorkshire Police protective services (crime), said: 'A 44-year-old man was arrested in Scarborough last night on suspicion of the murder of Gemma Simpson, who went missing in Leeds in May 2000.

'An address in Scarborough is currently being examined as part of the investigation and the man remains in custody while our inquiries continue.

'We have notified Gemma’s family and will be keeping them informed of any developments.'

It is understood that no body has been found at this stage.

Speaking to the Yorkshire Evening Post last year, Miss Simpson’s mother Linda Umpleby said: 'It’s unbearable. No mother should have to go through this.

'The frustration is so overwhelming you could scream.'

She said: 'I have had to live with this for 13 years and it cracks you up. I feel like she’s there by my side all the time.'

Police investigating the disappearance have gone as far as Amsterdam after reports that Gemma may have travelled to the Dutch city.

Her face has also featured on cartons of milk and even emblazoned on the side of a fleet of lorries in an effort to generate leads.

In a fresh appeal in October Superintendent Martin Snowden told Radio Aire: 'We have made a number of appeals over the years since Gemma’s disappearance but have never been able to confirm any further sightings of her since she was seen by a friend in Harehills on 5 May, 2000.

'She told the friend she was going to stay with another friend in Huddersfield but was not seen again.'
