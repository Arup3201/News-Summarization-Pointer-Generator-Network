David Hockney's ex-lover faces drugs charges after the death of a 23-year-old man at the artist’s seaside mansion.

Dominic Elliott died from swallowing toxic toilet cleaner after a 24-hour drink and drugs binge with his boyfriend John Fitzherbert, who previously had a long relationship with Mr Hockney.

The inquest into the death of Mr Elliott, who was Hockney’s studio assistant, yesterday heard details of an apparent ‘cover-up’ surrounding the tragedy.

Friends: Renowned artist David Hockney (left) employed keen sportsman Dominic Elliott (right) as an assistant, who died after drinking bleach after 24-hours of partying with the artist's ex

Mr Fitzherbert, 48, admitted he had 
phoned Mr Hockney’s chief assistant from hospital shortly after his 
lover’s death to ask him to clear his bedroom of drugs to shield the 
millionaire artist from ‘scandal’ because he was in poor health.

The
assistant, Jean Pierre Goncalves De Lima, did as instructed, but when 
police arrived at the house minutes later he told them ‘I’ve just done a
stupid thing’ and confessed to his actions.

Death: Dominic Elliott, 23, had 'partied' on 
alcohol, cocaine, ecstasy and cannabis with Hockney's ex John 
Fitzherbert, 48, pictured outside the inquest

After
the inquest ended yesterday it emerged that Mr Fitzherbert is one of 
two men who have been arrested and bailed for ‘drugs offences’ 
surrounding the incident in March.

The
inquest heard how Mr Elliott and Mr Fitzherbert had ‘partied’ in the 
house, drinking alcohol, taking cocaine and Ecstasy and smoking cannabis
before falling asleep in each other’s arms, just down the corridor from
the room where Mr Hockney was sleeping.

Mr
Fitzherbert and the artist ended their relationship four years ago but 
remained friends, with Mr Fitzherbert continuing to live in and run the 
house in Bridlington, East Yorkshire.

Mr
Fitzherbert then had a relationship with Mr Elliott.

But Mr Elliott was
said to be competing for his attentions with Mark Shephard, another 
household employee and school friend of Mr Elliot’s.

Both men would 
‘ingratiate’ themselves with Mr Fitzherbert for ‘gifts’.

Mr Shephard was
given a Land-Rover and taken to London by Mr Fitzherbert, making Mr 
Elliott jealous, the Hull inquest heard.

Coroner
Paul Marks recorded a verdict of misadventure and said he was satisfied
there were no suspicious circumstances or ‘third party involvement’ in 
Mr Elliott’s death on March 17.

He said there was no evidence Mr Elliott
intended to commit suicide, but that he was under the influence of 
drugs at the time.

Scene: Mr Elliott was taken to hospital from David Hockney's home (pictured) in Bridlington, East Yorkshire

Detective
Sergeant Thomas Napier was asked by the coroner about the ‘clear up’ of
drugs from Mr Fitzherbert’s bedroom to avoid ‘adverse publicity’.

Admission: Jean Pierre Goncalves De Lima told police that he had been asked to hide drugs at the request of John Fitzherbert

Mr
Napier said: ‘A decision was made no one should be arrested in 
connection with that. We felt it was more appropriate to investigate the
facts around Dominic’s death.’

But
outside court a police spokesman said two men aged 48 and 23 have been 
arrested on suspicion of drugs offences and released on police bail 
pending further inquiries.

There were discrepancies between the evidence of Mr Fitzherbert and several other witnesses.

Mr
Fitzherbert said Mr Elliott woke him at 4am to ask him to drive him to 
hospital and never revealed what he had drunk.

He said he saw the bottle
of toilet cleaner – with a 95 per cent sulphuric acid content – and 
worked out what happened himself.

But
a friend of Mr Elliott’s and several police officers told the inquest 
Mr Fitzherbert said his lover had told him that he had drunk the 
chemical cleaner before going to hospital.

In
his evidence Mr Goncalves De Lima said he had been woken by a call to 
his mobile from Mr Fitzherbert ‘in a bad state’ early on March 17.

‘He 
told me, “Dominic is dead, Dominic is dead”. He asked me to go and clear
his room of any evidence of drug use.’

He confirmed he had cleared the bedroom as requested.

Mr
Hockney said in a statement he had been unaware of the events. He said 
he ‘greatly valued’ Mr Elliott’s work and was ‘devastated by his death’.
