Bayern Munich star Arjen Robben told Arsene Wenger he should act with more class after being described as a 'great diver' by the Arsenal boss.

The Holland international hit back at the Gunners boss in the wake of the German club's 3-1 Champions League victory at the Allianz Arena, in which Robben won a late penalty.

The spot kick was saved by Lukasz Fabianksi, but Wenger waded in after the match, prompting a robust response from the Dutchman.

Making his point: Arjen Robben told Arsene Wenger to act with more class following the Frenchman's comments

Unimpressed: Arsenal boss Wenger described Bayern winger Robben as being a 'great diver'

Down: Robben won a late penalty for Bayern after going down under the challenge of Laurent Koscielny

Robben said: 'I always say if you are a big manager then take your loss… if you win be happy, enjoy, but if you lose don't complain about silly things.

'It was two penalties but I don't want to defend myself.

'From a big manager you expect a little bit more.'

Despite Arsenal’s spirited performance, Wenger had complained that Robben, who won a penalty at the Emirates when Wojciech Szczesny was sent off, dived again in the 52nd minute after a challenge by Santi Cazorla.

Wenger said: ‘He is a very good diver, but that is the way it goes. It is the referee - Robben is a fantastic player, but he doesn’t need to do it. He gets in front of the player, he goes down. We spoke about this yesterday. If the referee gives him a yellow card he will not do it again.’

Wenger remains convinced that Szczesny’s dismissal was the reason Bayern progressed to the quarter-finals.

Not this time: Referee Svein Oddvar Moen waved away Robben's appeals during the opening stages of the second half after the Dutchman went down under the challenge of Santi Cazorla

The Arsenal chief added: ‘We had a good chance to win the game. I believe that in the second half the opportunities were there but overall over the two games I feel the major decision was the one to send our keeper off.

‘Good luck to Bayern because they are a good side but this season they were more vulnerable. We have regrets. In the last five years we have twice played Barcelona, twice Bayern and they are at the top of their game every time.

‘Every time in the last two years at home we have been very harshly done by. Away from home we have not lost for a long time in Germany but at home we have been caught.

Wenger also confirmed that the club made an administrative error and were forced to name only six substitutes after realising Ryo Miyaichi was ineligible.

Miyaichi was taken out of the Champions League squad when Arsenal signed Kim Kallstrom in the January transfer window in the mistaken belief that he was registered on the ‘B’ list.

Wenger added: ‘We discovered too late he couldn’t play. I don’t think it would have made a difference.’

Mesut Ozil put in another dreadful display, then limped out of the action at half-time.

The Germany midfielder suffered a hamstring injury and looks sure to miss a series of crucial Barclays Premier League matches, starting with Sunday’s north London derby against Tottenham.

He was treated by Bayern and Germany doctor Hans Muller-Wohlfahrt at the break and will have a scan on Wednesday.

Bastian Schweinsteiger put Bayern in front but Arsenal equalised when Lukas Podolski rifled an effort beyond Manuel Neuer. Lukasz Fabianski saved a late penalty from Thomas Muller to earn Arsenal a draw but they lost the tie 3-1 on aggregate.

Ozil was replaced by Tomas Rosicky at half-time and Wenger said: ‘He’s out for a few weeks. It is a hamstring injury and it looks quite serious. I don’t know how long and we hope it’s not so bad.’

In the half that he was on the pitch, Ozil had just 21 touches of the ball.

To put that into perspective Thiago Alcantara, in the heart of Bayern’s midfield, had 66. Want more? Bastian Schweinsteiger 47, Arjen Robben 33, Franck Ribery 33.

The exuberance has deserted him just when his team-mates are looking to the former Real Madrid ace for inspiration.

The days when he drifted in and out of games with Real are behind him. Now he just looks like a lost soul, lazy and uninterested.

Meanwhile, Chelsea target Diego Costa stayed in his rich vein of form with a double as Atletico Madrid thumped seven-times European Cup winners AC Milan 4-1 (5-1 on aggregate) to secure a place in the quarter-finals.
