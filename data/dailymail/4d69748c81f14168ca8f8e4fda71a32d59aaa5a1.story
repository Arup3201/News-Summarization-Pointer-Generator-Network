Wayne Rooney has been named England's player of the year after coming out on top in a fan vote.

The England skipper was presented with the award ahead of Tuesday's training session at St Georges Park.

Chelsea's Dominic Solanke received the young player of the year award as voted for by England development coaches.

The youngster is a member of England's Under 18 squad but trained with Roy Hodgson's men on Tuesday. 

Meanwhile, Tottenham striker Harry Kane stepped out for his first senior England team training session.

Kane, who scored a hat-trick against Leicester to take his season tally to 29 goals at the weekend, will be hoping to impress England boss Roy Hodgson ahead of Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania.

The 21-year-old striker looked at ease as during a light warm-up as he jogged alongside fellow uncapped Spurs team-mate Ryan Mason, who was drafted into the squad after Adam Lallana withdrew because of a groin injury. 

However, Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph did not take part in the session through illness.

The FA's technical director Dan Ashworth and sports psychiatrist Steve Peters were both seen at the  session.

England take on Lithuania in Friday's Euro 2016 qualifier at Wembley before playing a friendly against Italy at the Juventus Stadium in Turin.
