While Ligue 1 and La Liga held a minute’s silence at every game after the terror attacks on Paris last week, English football wrapped itself up in its cosy blanket of arrogance, ignorance, insularity and insensitivity and carried on doing the appalling things with which it is now sadly synonymous.

A footballer convicted of rape, still serving his sentence and on the sex offenders’ register expected sympathy when he moaned about ‘mob rule’ stopping him having a career (he could flip burgers under the golden arches if he is so keen to work rather than live off the money he takes from the family of the girlfriend he showed no respect to when he raped another woman).

A Premier League manager turned into one of the country’s finest legal minds when he declared he’s done what he claims few others have, and studied the Ched Evans case in detail and he’s decided the rape conviction isn’t safe.

He concluded Evans has a good chance with his ‘appeal.’ Except it’s not an appeal because the court decided not to give him leave to appeal. It’s a case review. But then Steve Bruce actually doesn’t have a clue what he’s talking about. 

He’s just got a special 'football friend' who he wants to support (Bruce and the Oldham chairman Simon Corney are pals apparently) and so Bruce has taken his size 11 feet, put some massive heavy hobnailed boots on them and trampled all over the sensitivities and feelings of the rape victim, the rape victim’s friends and family, all women across the world and all decent, right-thinking men by talking utter garbage.

Meantime, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers’ Association, Gordon Taylor, who has been in his job for 35 years, decided he’d make a comparison between Ched Evans and the Hillsborough victims.

It’s not just the fact that Taylor thinks he can pre-empt the outcome of the Criminal Case Review (Taylor & Bruce Legal Services – remind me never to use these two if ever I’m in need of legal representation), no it’s worse than that.

How the Daily Mail reported Taylor's comments

To lump the Liverpool fans at Hillsborough that fateful day in with Ched Evans, someone who it has been established beyond doubt cheated on his girlfriend by having oral sex with a girl who was completely drunk (part of Evans’ failed defence was that the victim was so drunk she had forgotten she’d consented and ergo consent was given, rather than not been in any fit state to consent - he really did try to argue that in court) who he had never met before he entered the hotel room, then had sex with her (watched by one friend who was also in the room and filmed by others who were outside) and left via the fire escape.

Appalling from Taylor, and what a class act Margaret Aspinall CBE, chair of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, is to accept Taylor’s apology. This is one very special woman.

Worse to follow: the Football Association decided it didn’t need to intervene in the Ched Evans situation. 

That’s right, the governors of our beautiful game had absolutely nothing to say about a convicted rapist, out under licence, still claiming his innocence and because of that showing no remorse for his crime, and not apologising for his crime, potentially playing for a professional football club under its governance. 

The FA, who champion equality, who are promoting women’s football massively, who do so many good things for so many good causes in this country, had nothing to say about the Ched Evans situation. How is that possible?

The worrying outcome is that clubs are left rudderless, unable to guide themselves, and so you’ll get a manager claiming he’s a legal expert, you’ll have a chairman thinking it’s fine to employ someone on the sex offenders’ register at a football club which positions itself at the very heart of a diverse community and actively encourages families, women and children to go to see what is on offer at Boundary Park, and you’ll end up with a PFA chairman who really should know better, talking so thoughtlessly that he insults thousands of still grieving people on Merseyside.

Football in England is still a sickening mess of racism, anti-Semitism, misogyny, and ignorance.

'Don’t sign too many black players because they’ll form a clique and get you the sack,' a former manager told me.

'When can the lads take a sh*t on your face?' a professional footballer who has played in the Premier League once said to a female reporter as she prepared to interview him. The club effectively swept it under the carpet, her male bosses did the same.

'What’s Anelka done wrong?' so many people screamed after his quenelle gesture. Those who were so ignorant they had to ask such a crass question must now be looking at the Jewish community fleeing Paris like the Jews did in Nazi Germany in the 1930s and feel ashamed of themselves.

Nicolas Anelka's anti-Semitic 'quenelle' gesture caused controversy back in February last year 

I’m generalising here of course, and it’s worth saying that so many people within the game are wonderful people who give up their time and money for the good of football, charitable causes and the community.

But the bigger picture is that football in England is a whole bowl of wrong.

And events last week showed just how backward the game is in this country when it comes to a question of what is right and decent.

A thoroughly sickening time for English football ended with nobody at the FA, the Premier League, the Football League or any individual clubs giving a second thought to the horrors in Paris.

Arsene Wenger spoke eloquently on the subject in his press conference while the Arsenal and Stoke players all wore black armbands.

Bafetimbi Gomis, who’s from Toulon, held up a Tricolore after Swansea scored and AFC Bournemouth tweeted a photo of their French player Yann Kermorgant holding a poster which read 'Je Suis Charlie' in support of those who suffered in Paris. 

There may have been other individual marks of respect, but no directive was sent down from the football authorities and no game held a minute’s silence.

With more than 40 French players here, that is a disgraceful fact that does not reflect well on English football.

Common decency seems to be impossible for some people who hold responsible positions in football in this country. That needs to change and some proper leadership is required to make that change happen throughout our game.

Is it wrong for me as a lover of football to want the game to be decent? No, actually I want more than that – I want the national game to be one of the beacons of what is good about England.

To show the way, to set an example, to be pure and wholesome.

Not to spit-roast girls and treat them like pieces of meat.

Not to show ignorance or indifference to political and religious hate.

Not to be totally insensitive towards people who have suffered the most appalling tragedies and horrors.

So while Spain, France and others across Europe showed respect, England didn’t. In a country that will hold a minute’s silence for people who haven’t even died, no decision-makers thought the tragedies in France warranted any kind of collective respect from English football.

To paraphrase Morgan Freeman in Bonfire of the Vanities, a film about a man who unexpectedly has to suffer the consequences of his appalling actions: 'Be decent football, be decent.'
