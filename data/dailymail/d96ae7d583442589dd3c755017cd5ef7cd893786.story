Noddy Holder does not look like a drink and drug-addled rocker. His skin is pink and soft, his hair is fluffy and clean, and his mutton chops are still fulsome. Even his long-suffering liver is still going strong.

‘I tend to get pretty plastered but I’ve got an amazing constitution,’ he says.

‘All the different bands have tried to outdrink me and spike my drinks. Ozzy Osbourne [the Black Sabbath singer] had all sorts of tricks. I was the only one who could keep up with him, though he was much more into drugs than me.

‘But I’ve never passed out. Never even had a proper memory blackout. Or been sick.

‘Today, I drink fewer drinks, but stronger: Gin Martinis. I could still be up all night, no problem, but now it takes me a week to get over it. In fact, I’m off out tonight!’

Noddy (real name Neville, after Neville Chamberlain) is 68. Back in the day, Slade, the glam rockers he fronted, were superstars. They sold 50 million records, made 20 albums and had six Number Ones, including 1973 Christmas hit Merry Xmas Everybody.

Officially the most heard song in the world, it still generates well over £500,000 in royalties every festive season — ‘It’s a brilliant pension plan,’ says Noddy.

They had groupies (despite being ‘a bit uglier and heavier than most of the other bands’) and private jets.

They partied every night, slept with hundreds of different girls (‘though the best bit was always when they’d ask us all round to their parents’ house for Sunday lunch’) and grasped opportunities that most young lads from Walsall could only have imagined.

‘Most people we knew had never been abroad. When you’re in a rock band, you want to pick up girls, drive flash cars and see the world — and we made the most of it. We didn’t know it was going to last 25 years!’

But Slade were never quite what you’d describe as ‘cool’. Nor were they edgy. There were no massive drug-binges (‘we were more of a booze band’), no orgies, threesomes (‘I don’t think we were really into all that’) or scandalous arrests.

There wasn’t even any gratuitous smashing-up of hotel rooms. While rival bands were busy hurling tellies through windows, Noddy was more likely to be doing a spot of DIY in his room.

Wholesome: Over the years, many of Noddy’s peers fell foul of drugs, alcohol, suicide, bankruptcy. He avoided it all. Above, pictured in 1974

‘I always carried a screwdriver, and later a full tool kit. So, if I had an hour before the gig, I’d fix things. It was quicker than calling down to reception, and that way you can have it all nice for the next person.’

Even Slade’s legendary parties (‘we had one pretty much every single night we were on tour’) would come to a sudden halt when the boys got a bit tired.

‘We’d put on [BBC comedy] Hancock’s Half Hour. The Yanks couldn’t understand it, but we’d fall about laughing and they’d get bored and go home … and we’d go to bed.’

Over the years, many of Noddy’s peers fell foul of drugs, alcohol, suicide, bankruptcy, increasingly desperate comebacks and terrible hair-dye. He, meanwhile, remains a picture of wholesome contentment.

He enjoys acting, radio work, does lucrative voice-overs for TV adverts, lives in a ‘very nice house’ near Manchester, is happily married and has just written a book, The World According To Noddy, which is part memoir, part musings about life.

He is also, despite leaving the band more than 23 years ago (to tend to his dying father and pick up the pieces of his crumbling first marriage), instantly recognisable as Slade’s frontman. Which has its drawbacks.

‘At least once a day throughout the year, someone shouts “It’s Christmas!” at me. In December, it happens 10 or 20 times a day, and I have to get my Christmas shopping out of the way before December or I get mobbed.

‘I’m not complaining — writing Merry Xmas was the best day’s work we’ve ever done and I’m proud of it — but they all think it’s the first time anyone’s ever shouted it.

‘And I’ve been getting this for 40-odd years!’ (An estimated 42 per cent of the planet, more than three billion people, are thought to have heard Merry Xmas Everybody.)

Today, people also try to grab covert snaps of Noddy to post online. Bizarrely, some men attempt to take surreptitious pictures of Noddy’s manhood as he relieves himself at public urinals.

‘They lean over and go “click”. It happens all the time. It’s ludicrous. Why on earth would someone want a photo of me p***ing?’

Why indeed? Perhaps it’s just the (very odd) price of fame. Which all started in Walsall in 1966 when Noddy joined drummer Don Powell and guitarists Dave Hill and Jim Lea to form The ‘NBetweens. They later became Slade and had a huge hit with Coz I Luv You.

They dressed in over-the-top mirrored outfits, strutted like peacocks (‘The Americans thought four aliens had landed’), made a fortune and paid outlandish amounts of tax.

‘It was 83 per cent! We could have gone abroad for a bit and avoided it — lots of bands did — but we were from working-class families and we had a social conscience.’

Success: Merry Xmas Everybody was Slade's third single in a year to go straight in at Number One in 1973 (after Cum on Feel the Noize and Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me) — something even The Beatles didn’t manage

Merry Xmas Everybody was their third single in a year to go straight in at Number One in 1973 (after Cum on Feel the Noize and Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me) — something even The Beatles didn’t manage.

Yet as punk music took over in the mid-70s, Slade’s star faded. ‘Suddenly, we were boring old farts, playing civic centres again. By 1980, we were pretty much finished.’

And then Ozzy Osbourne dropped out of the Reading Festival, Slade filled in and the crowd went berserk. ‘It changed everything. We had a second wave in the Eighties.’

Noddy has always been a big believer in ‘what goes around comes around’.

‘I love everyone on sight, and you’d have to do something really bad for me to turn nasty.

‘I have never knowingly lied, or done anything nasty to anyone, or even nicked anything.’ He even gets on with his first wife, Leandra, with whom he has two daughters.

He claims Leandra was one of the biggest supporters of his budding romance with his second wife, Suzan, a television executive and journalist whom he met when she was 24 and he was 43. They now have a 19-year-old son, Django.

‘I never chucked a telly out of the window, but I did drive a car into a swimming pool once. Well, nearly. It was teetering on the edge, anyway.

‘And we never went short of women. Marc Bolan got all the screamers, but we got our fair share.’

And, latterly, it transpires, a lot of letters from people claiming to be Noddy’s illegitimate offspring.

‘I used to have loads of people claiming I’d fathered them — loads! They’d write to the office — sometimes nice letters, often not. They all tried it on. You just had to ignore it.’

And would he have remembered fathering them anyway?

‘God Almighty, no! Of course not. But it was rubbish. It was all about money. That’s all they cared about.’

Is there anything that gets him riled up? This is someone who was ditched by BBC2 series Grumpy Old Men because he wasn’t grumpy enough.

‘Oh yes, loads! Politicians, lack of respect for elders, people who talk in “quiet carriages”, cycling on pavements — that drives me crackers.’

Oh yes, and being asked if the original Slade will ever reform. (‘Never. I’ve toured the world 20 times already.’) Nor has he any intention of watching bandmates Don Powell and Dave Hill, who still tour as Slade II.

‘It’d make me feel funny to watch. I’d feel strange watching half the band doing the songs that the other half wrote. I didn’t really want them to carry on using the name, but it wasn’t worth going to court for, was it? Life’s too short for all that s***.’

Noddy Holder is one of the most content people you’ll meet. He seems remarkably unspoilt by success — and, as ever, looking forward to a strong drink. And another very lucrative Christmas.
