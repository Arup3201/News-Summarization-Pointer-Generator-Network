A letter sent to President Obama is being tested for ricin after it contained the same chilling text as mail laced with the poison that was sent to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, it has emerged.

The letter to the president was received on Thursday at a mail screening facility and did not reach the White House, law enforcement sources told NBC4.

Authorities fear the letter could also contain ricin as it bears the same message sent to Bloomberg and his anti-gun group: 'What's in this letter is nothing compared to what I've got planned for you.'

CBS reported that the letter was postmarked from Shreveport, Louisiana, which was also the postmark for the two letters sent to Bloomberg.

One of the letters sent to Bloomberg was retrieved at the City Hall, and the second arrived at the headquarters of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which Bloomberg 
operates and personally finances.

They contained threats warning him to stay away from the gun laws debate, authorities said. NBC reported that the text warned that anyone who goes to the sender’s house will 'get shot in the face'.

Under threat? A threatening letter sent to President Barack Obama is being tested for ricin after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was sent two similar letters laced with the poison last week

Sources also previously told CBS News that the letter said, 'this 
is a taste of what’s to come if you come to take my gun' - though the 
exact wording was not disclosed.

NYPD officials said
the threatening letters were opened on Friday in New York at the 
city's mail facility and on Sunday in Washington at the headquarters of 
the nonprofit.

Three 
members of the NYPD fell ill after being exposed to the letters, which 
contained a 'pink, orange oily substance', authorities said. Their 
symptoms have since subsided.

'The
 writer, in letters, threatened Mayor Bloomberg, with references to the 
debate on gun laws,' said Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the 
New York Police Department.

Speaking about the letters on Wednesday night, Mayor Bloomberg said that he did not feel threatened and that the mail would not scare him away from engaging in the debate over gun laws.

Targeted: Mayor Michael Bloomberg, pictured at the Real Estate Board of New York on May 30th, was sent two letters laced with the poison ricin. The attack left three members of the NYPD ill

Destination: The letter containing ricin addressed to New York City Mayor Bloomberg arrived here at 100 Gold Street - it was also where three members of the NYPD were exposed to the poison

'There's 12,000 people that are going
 to get killed this year with guns and 19,000 that are going to commit 
suicide with guns, and we're not going to walk away from those efforts,'
 he said.

'And I know I
 speak for all of the close to 1,000 mayors,' in Mayors Against Illegal 
Guns, he said. 'This is a scourge on the country that we just have to 
make sure that we get under control and eliminate.'

It has not been made public yet why it took the FBI and the NYPD five days to announce the disturbing discovery.

The matter is being investigated by 
the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force which said that the letter sent to 
Manhattan for billionaire Bloomberg arrived at 100 Gold Street - the 
home of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development.

Both
 the New York and Washington D.C. notes were addressed to Bloomberg and 
contained threats referencing the debate on gun laws.

Ricin Plot: Mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg attends a press conference for the CitiBike Program on Memorial Day

Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans. The beans can be safely made in to castor oil, but ricin is a part of the waste 'mash' from the oil production. It can be made into a powder, a mist or a pellet and is poisonous if inhaled, injected, or ingested.

Chewing the beans can also release the harmful substance.

For ricin to poison people, it would have to be a deliberate act, according to the CDC. The only accidental injuries could come through ingesting castor beans.

Ricin gets inside the cells of a person’s body and prevents the cells from making proteins they need. Without the proteins, cells die.

It can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal and circulatory symptoms and can lead to death 36 to 72 hours after exposure.

In 1978, Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian writer and journalist living in London, died after he was attacked by a man with an umbrella which had been rigged to inject a poison ricin pellet under Markov's skin.

The second letter to the mayor was 
opened by Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, who has 
not been reported to have fallen ill.

Mr. Bloomberg never received either letter which was addressed to him 
and no civilians have fallen ill due to either letter sent.

However,
 according to Browne, three members of the NYPD Emergency Service Unit 
who came into contact with the open letter in Manhattan were exposed and
 fell ill.

They 
experienced minor symptoms of ricin poisoning but are currently under 
medical supervision and they are said to be responding well to 
treatment.

The NYPD confirmed preliminary testing indicated the presence of ricin.

'The FBI has an investigation ongoing and so things like the exact 
wording and the postmarks, etc. we’re not going to disclose,' NYPD 
deputy commissioner Paul Browne told WCBS 880.

'It was a pink-orange 
oily substance that subsequently, in the preliminary tests, indicate the
 presence of ricin.'

Ricin is a poison found naturally in castor beans.

It's not clear if the letters were related to other threatening, ricin-laced letters sent to other lawmakers recently.

The letters allegedly originated from
 Shreveport, Louisiana according to a statement from the American Postal
 Workers Union Website. The first two letters were postmarked May 20.

Authorities are now 'in the process of searching to determine if there may be additional letters,' according to the statement.

The letter writer made references in his notes to the ongoing debate on gun laws.

Mayor
 Bloomberg is an outspoken critic of current gun laws and has campaigned
 nationally and on Capitol Hill for stricter gun legislation - using his
 own considerable wealth to fund commercials.

The
 confirmation of ricin present in both letters came through on Wednesday
 from the National Bioforensic Analysis Center in Maryland.

Ricin symptoms depend on the amount 
of exposure and dose received, but within a few hours lead to cough, 
fever, nausea, tightness in the chest and heavy breathing.

Death follows through fluid build up in the lungs.

Several
 ricin-laced letters have been sent to U.S. politicians over the past 
few months - including one addressed to President Obama in mid-April.

A
 Mississippi man, James Everett Duschke stands accused of making the 
poison ricin and sending those letters - which also went to Senator 
Roger Wicker and a Mississippi judge.

Initially, a friend of Dutschke's, Paul Kevin Curtis was arrested, but he claimed he had been framed after he was released.
