A 22-year-old mother who graduated last month from a law enforcement academy has been charged with shooting her boyfriend dead.

Claudia Kristine Esquivel, from Galveston, Texas, allegedly shot her boyfriend, Christopher Chapa, 27, once in the head on Monday morning before fleeing their home and going to her mother's house.

Her mother called 911 at 4am to report a 'family violence incident' and when police arrived at Esquivel's home, they found her boyfriend killed with the single bullet.

Investigators called the number that had dialed 911 and found Esquivel at her mother's home.

'The suspect went to mother's house and the mother made the initial call,' Galveston Police Chief Henry Porretto said.

She told investigators that she had used the gun the couple had to carry out the shooting and she was arrested, ABC13 reported.

Authorities have offered no motive for the shooting and said that the investigation is still in its early stages.

Neighbors said they were baffled by the killing. They did not hear any gunshots, they said.

'I didn't hear a thing,' neighbor Ben Gonzalez told ABC13, adding: 'I never thought this was going to happen because I never saw them fight; they were always happy.'

Shock: Neighbors, who did not hear the gunshot, said they thought the young couple appeared happy

Tragic: Esquivel, who graduated from a law enforcement academy last month, allegedly shot him once in the head before fleeing to her mother's house. Her mother then contacted authorities and she was arrested

The couple moved in to the house a month ago, although the home had been in her family for years. They worked at the same restaurant together.

And just last month, Esquivel, who has a five-year-old son from a previous relationship, graduated from Galveston College's Law Enforcement Academy.

But Police Sgt. Joshua Schirard said records show Esquivel has not passed a state agency's licensing exam and is not yet a certified peace officer.

Friends said she was inspired to become a police officer by an uncle who's a deputy.

She remains in Galveston County Jail, where her bond is set at $150,000.
