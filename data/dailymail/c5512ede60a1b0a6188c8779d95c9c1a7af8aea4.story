A 27-year-old mother convicted in the mysterious disappearance of her infant son, known as 'Baby Gabriel', five years ago has been released from prison.

Elizabeth Johnson walked out of Perryville state prison in Arizona early Friday morning.

The Arizona woman was given a more than five-year 
sentence in 2012 for custodial interference and unlawful imprisonment after Gabriel vanished without a trace in 2009.

Johnson's attorney, Marc Victor, said his client, who had begged the judge for a longer prison sentence, was ready for a new start.

'I think she has matured a lot from this entire experience,' Victor told ABC15. 'She has what I would call some grand plans to move on with her life.'

Victor added that Johnson didn't know where Gabriel was, but assumed he was with a good family. She said it probably wouldn't be in his best interests if they were reunited.

'Justice was served here. Elizabeth was convicted of exactly the crimes she committed. She's served her sentence and now faces four years' probation,' Victor told azcentral.com.

'What's least understood about Elizabeth is that at all times she acted in what she believed was Gabriel's best interests. There was a ton of information we didn't bring out that showed she loved Gabriel at all times.'

The tragic story of Gabriel's disappearance captured national attention, with many Americans still regarding Johnson as a 'suspected baby-killer'.

According to court testimony, in December 2009, Johnson had an argument with Gabriel's father, Logan McQueary, and fled with the child.

Johnson had been fighting with McQueary about whether to give up Gabriel for adoption. She signed over temporary guardianship of the boy to a Scottsdale couple for about 10 days before she picked him up and left Arizona.

Two days after leaving McQueary, she sent him a text saying she suffocated the boy and dumped his body in the trash outside a San Antonio, Texas hotel room.

'I killed him. You made me do it,' Johnson wrote to McQueary two days after Christmas. She fled to Florida where she was arrested on December 30.

However, following her capture, she changed her story, claiming she gave Gabriel to a couple in a park in San Antonio. Johnson never identified the pair.

Investigators searched dumpsters, landfills and parks, but never found the boy.

During the trial, McQueary's family pleaded with Johnson to tell them where Gabriel was.

'This isn't over for our family,' Frank McQueary, Gabriel's paternal grandfather, said. 'This is not going to be over until we know where Gabriel is.'

In October 2012, Johnson was charged with custodial interference and unlawful imprisonment.

The jury failed to reach a verdict on a kidnapping charge — the most serious count against her which would have attracted a more than 20 year sentence.

In December, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Joseph Kreamer sentenced Johnson to five years and three months jail, and four years of probation on release. She received credit toward her prison sentence for the nearly three years that she served in jail after her arrest.

Kreamer could have sentenced her to 9 1/2 years but said he took into account her troubled childhood and mental instability, agreeing with a psychologist who testified she needed treatment.

'Her chances to succeed are increased if she gets treatment, there's no doubt about it,' the judge said. 'We are three years downstream. We don't know where Gabriel is.'

Prior to sentencing, Johnson stood before the judge sobbing and apologized for what she did, but maintained her story that she gave Gabriel away to a couple in Texas.

'I wanted to give Gabriel a life that was better than I had growing up,' she said softly.

'What I have done is unbelievable. There's not really anything I can say for myself. I would convict myself. It's horrible. ... I do deserve the max.'
