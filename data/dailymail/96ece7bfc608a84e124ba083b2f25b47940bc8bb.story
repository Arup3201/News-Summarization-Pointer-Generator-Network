For little Georgia Mitchell the changing seasons heralds an exciting opportunity - the chance to play outside with her friends. 

The five-year-old spends the warm summer months watching from the window desperate to play in the sunshine.

A rare skin condition, which leaves Georgia covered in painful scales, has held her hostage in her Kentucky home.

When she was born doctors diagnosed her with the extremely rare illness non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NBIE).

It is excruciating and sunshine and heat exacerbates the painful symptoms. 

Georgia Mitchell, from Kentucky, is forced to stay indoors during the summer months. She was born with an extremely rare skin condition, which causes scales to form all over her skin. Sunshine and heat aggravates the illness, causing her excruciating pain

But with winter around the corner, the five-year-old is excited at the prospect of getting outside to play with friends. Doctors diagnosed the youngster with non-bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma at birth

Her mother Misty Mitchell, pictured with husband Sonny, said she knew something was wrong as soon as she had given birth after an emergency C-section

Georgia's mother, Misty Mitchell, 33, said as soon as she gave birth to her daughter, via emergency C-section, she knew something was wrong.

'When Georgia was born she had scales all over her skin - it looks like she has been burnt,' she said.

'Doctors didn't think she'd make it.

'Because of her skin she gets overheated very easily and so she cannot play outside when it is hot.

'She can't play any sports because she will get too hot too quickly.

'A lot of children don't understand why she can't join them outside. This just makes it harder for Georgia because the kids will not play with her.

'But now she is really looking forward to the winter. She cannot wait to get out in the snow and make snowmen with her friends.'

Georgia, from Harlan, Kentucky was diagnosed with NBIE when she was born - a life-long condition which causes severe scaling of the skin.

One of the complications of the illness, is that it prevents the normal process of sweating.

It means sunlight and exercise can aggravate Georgia's skin, making her condition more painful. 

Mrs Mitchell, said: 'Because of her skin we have to say no to her when she asks to do certain things which is heart-breaking.

'She wants to go to Disney World but we just can't let her. There have been so many birthday parties she has asked to go to that we have to just say no because of the heat.

Mrs Mitchell, said: 'Because of her skin she gets overheated very easily and so she cannot play outside when it is hot. Now she is really looking forward to the winter. She cannot wait to get out in the snow and make snowmen with her friends'

The life-long condition is inherited and caused by a genetic or inherited abnormality that affects normal skin shedding. Severe scaling of the skin prevents normal sweating so hot weather or vigorous exercise causes painful repercussions for Georgia

'But it is amazing when the winter comes each year because we can let her go outside.

'I am really looking forward to it because I love that she will be able to go outside and play.'

When Mrs Mitchell went into labour and gave birth at just 32 weeks, she immediately knew something was wrong with her daughter.

'I had an emergency C-section and when I woke up when they were pushing me back to my room, I could immediately tell by my family's faces that something was wrong,' she said.

'They told me something was not right with her skin and that she was going to be transferred to a different hospital.

'But I wasn't allowed to go with her because I had just had a C-section.

'They bought her in to see me first and she was in a big bag covering her body with just her little head sticking out.'

Mrs Mitchell and her husband Sonny, 38, were warned their daughter may not survive, before their newborn was transferred to the Johnson City Medical Centre. 

But after nine days in the hospital's neonatal unit, Mr and Mrs Mitchell were able to take their little girl home, on Christmas Eve. 

Mrs Mitchell said: 'I had an emergency C-section and when I woke up when they were pushing me back to my room, I could immediately tell by my family's faces that something was wrong'

Doctors warned Mr and Mrs Mitchell that their daughter may not survive beyond two weeks, before transferring her to a specialist neonatal unit. After nine days in hospital, the couple were overjoyed to be able to bring Georgia home, on Christmas Eve 

Due to her condition Georgia's parents were forced to withdraw her from school, after she came home each day crying in pain. Mrs Mitchell added: 'The most important lesson I have learned is to take one day at a time, have faith and enjoy the life you have been given'

Non-bullous ichthyosiform erythroderma is an extremely rare skin disorder,characterised by abnormal scaling of the skin with underlying redness.

It is estimated to occur in one in 300,000 births.

The skin appears bright red, and has accompanying fine white or flesh coloured scales. The scales are often seen all over a sufferer's body, but the skin on the face may show milder changes. 

The condition is usually detected in the first few days of life, and is a life-long condition for most sufferers. 

It is caused by a genetic or inherited abnormality that affects normal skin shedding. 

One in four children will inherit two abnormal genes - one from each parent - and therefore develop the condition.

Complications of the condition include:

There is currently no cure for NBIE.

Treatments include preventing overheating, specific creams, drugs, as well as psychological support and counselling.

'I was so worried but the doctors were fabulous and took wonderful care of Georgia,' Mrs Mitchell said.

'They were the longest nine days of my life but it was amazing when we were finally able to bring her home.

'They taught us how to live with her condition and what she could and couldn't do.'

Having been warned Georgia might not survive beyond two weeks, Mrs Mitchell said her daughter has gone from strength to strength.

'They said even if she did, she wouldn't be able to crawl or walk,' she said.

'But you just have to take a look at her now to see she is doing both of these things and she is doing amazingly well.'

While Georgia has proved doctors wrong, excelling in her development, the illness does hold her back from every day activities. 

Despite loving school, Georgia's parents had to make the difficult decision to withdraw her from classes, because it proved too much for her. 

'She would come home and cry every night because her legs hurt after trying to keep up with the other children,' Mrs Mitchell said.

'It was such a shame because it was a massive milestone to reach, another one the doctors had said wouldn't happen, but she made it and she loved it.'

Despite this, Mrs Mitchell is determined her daughter will excel in life.

Mrs Mitchell added: 'Georgia is very outgoing and she lets nothing hold her back.

'My daughter is going to be somebody. She says she wants to be a doctor and we continue to encourage her.

'We let her know that she can do anything.

'The most important lesson I have learned is to take one day at a time, have faith and enjoy the life you have been given.

'Georgia continues to prove the doctors wrong and I am so proud of her.'

Mr and Mrs Mitchell have set up a Facebook page Sweet Georgia's Journey, to raise awareness of the condition.
