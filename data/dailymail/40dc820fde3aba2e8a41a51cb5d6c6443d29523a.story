With its dramatic coastline and verdant hills, Ireland’s County Cork has long been a magnet for celebrities wanting a break from the limelight. 

American-born Irish dancer Michael Flatley has a home there, as does London-born Hollywood star Angela Lansbury, actor Jeremy Irons and film producer Lord Puttnam.

Even the hard-drinking Oliver Reed used to retreat to the area for the occasional break from hellraising.

But probably the most famous star to find a hideaway in County Cork is the queen of Hollywood romance, Maureen O’Hara, who has owned a spellbinding property on the coast for more than 45 years.

The movie legend, 94, has taken the painful decision to put the home, called Lugdine Park, on the market

Now, at the age of 94, the movie legend has taken the painful decision to put the home, called Lugdine Park, on the market and live full-time in the States.

She told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I have so many wonderful memories over these many years at Lugdine, and now it’s time to pass her on to another lucky family who will cherish her as much as I have.’

Once considered the world’s most beautiful woman, Dublin-born O’Hara is relocating to Idaho to live with her daughter Bronwyn.

Lugdine Park, which was built in 1935, boasts five bedrooms, 35 acres of land and two private islands. It has wildly romantic views of the Atlantic Ocean and looks down on the harbour of the village of Glengarriff. It also has a guest cottage, outdoor changing rooms and WCs, and a private bathing beach.

‘I have the most wonderful neighbours a person can hope for in Glengarriff,’ she said. ‘We’ve been together for so long and love each other as old friends. Everybody has always been very respectful of my privacy if I want it, but I can’t wait to see everyone whenever I arrive.

‘Of course, I always get a chuckle when “lost” tourists happen to stumble upon my house in need of directions back to the village.

‘They always have their cameras with them ready to snap.’

O'Hara made five movies with John Wayne, including Wings of Eagles (pictured)

O’Hara’s big break came when she auditioned for a movie role in London, after she had studied at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin. 

Oscar-winning actor Charles Laughton happened upon her screen test and was captivated by her expressive eyes. He recommended her for the lead role in Alfred Hitchcock’s British-made 1939 film Jamaica Inn. 

O’Hara – who was born FitzSimons but changed her name to O’Hara as it was shorter – received rave reviews for her debut role, despite the fact that the film was a commercial flop. It paved her way to Hollywood, where, with her alluring mix of red hair, refulgent green eyes and fiercely passionate attitude, she earned the title the ‘Queen of Technicolor’. 

She starred in The Hunchback Of Notre Dame, How Green Was My Valley, The Black Swan, Sinbad The Sailor and Miracle On 34th Street.

She also made five movies with John Wayne, including The Quiet Man, in which Wayne played an Irish-born American returning to his homeland. 

She has been married three times, having her daughter with her second husband, the film director William Houston-Price. 

One place that has been a constant for her over the past half-century is her vast home in West Cork. She has a unbreakable connection to the people in the small community of Glengarriff and has been the honorary vice president of Glengarriff Golf Club, participating in and promoting tournaments, bringing thousands to the area and putting the small fishing village on the map.

There has been many a famous visitor to her home too. ‘Ed Koch was a beloved Mayor of New York City and friend who did visit me at Lugdine,’ she said. ‘We had a wonderful time in our cosy village and he delighted everyone with his wonderful wit. He spent every morning gazing out the window at that magnificent bay, sipping his coffee.

Price: €2.095million (approx £1.52million)

Location: Glengarriff, Co Cork

Bedrooms: Five

Unique features: Home of Hollywood legend Maureen O'Hara, two private islands and private beach, 35 acres of land 

‘He said it was the perfect view to accompany his perfect cup of coffee. Everyone who visited, famous or not, always said it took their breath away, they loved the serenity of it.’

When asked for any advice for the next owners of her home, she said: ‘Greet everyone you meet with a smile and friendly hand and they’ll wrap their loving arms around you. It’s a lovely, lovely village filled with wonderful people who are so proud of this magical piece of heaven.’
