Television and movie streaming juggernaut, Netflix, is believed be planning to launch in Australia next year, with two Netflix acquisitions executives travelling to Sydney next week to meet with Australian-based distributors.

The low-cost streaming service, which provides users with unlimited access to a library of selected movies and television shows, was launched in the U.S. four  years ago to great success, amassing 32 million subscribers in four years.

Netflix is not available in Australia, though market sources estimate up to 200,000 Australians use the service via a VPN – software that makes a user's IP address appear as though it is located in the U.S. – paying the monthly subscription fee.

Netflix, the online streaming service that produces House of Cards starring Kevin Spacey (pictured), is coming to Australia

Netflix began discussions in May about the Australian rights to movies and television series during the Los Angeles Screenings, Inside Film reported.

The service is expected to launch in Australia and New Zealand in the first half of 2015 and to cost $10 per month.

Foxtel's Presto service costs a $19.99 per month for 'all-you-can-eat' to new release movies and access to its back catalogue.

Netflix has access to a large library of films and television series, as well as featuring acclaimed original series, such as House Of Cards, Orange Is The New Black and season four of Arrested Development.

It is hoped that the arrival of Netflix on Australian shores might help curb high rates of illegal downloading in the country.

Australia leads the world for illegal downloads of movies and television shows.

It is estimated that 200,000 people currently use Netflix in Australia, using a VPN, which makes it appear as if the user's IP address is in the U.S. Pictured: Taylor Schilling (left) and Laura Prepon (centre) in Orange is the New Black

Netflix allows users access to movies and television shows, including Breaking Bad

The premiere of Game Of Thrones season four, which set a new piracy record, was downloaded illegally by more than 500,000 in the first 12 hours after it aired.

Torrent Freak reported that 11.6 percent of these illegal downloads came from Australia, an achievement even more remarkable considering Australia's relatively small population.

Several streaming companies are currently available in Australia, including Quickflix, Presto and Ezyflix, though none offer the same service at Netflix.

Like Netflix, Quickflix allows users to access a library of film and television series, unlike Netflix it requires users to purchase recent releases individually, on top of their monthly fee.

Presto offers unlimited access to its movie library for a  monthly fee, like Netflix does, though at this stage does not allow users access to any television series.

Ezyflix operates on a postage-based system, with users selecting DVDs that are then posted to them.

For the same monthly fee that Netflix users pay for unlimited access to movies and television series, Ezyflix users can get four DVDs per month sent to them, with one movie out at a time.

Netflix has received plaudits for its original series including Arrested Development season five (cast pictured), Orange Is The New Black and House Of Cards
