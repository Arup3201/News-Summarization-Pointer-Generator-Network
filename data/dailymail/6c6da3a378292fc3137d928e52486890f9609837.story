They are one of the best-equipped and fearsome military forces in the world.

But, for these four members of the Israeli army, their hi-tech equipment turned against them after a collection of tear gas cannisters exploded in the back of their armoured van.

The soldiers can be seen pouring out of the back of the vehicle, which came to a stop in the contested West Bank territories near the River Jordan.

Evacuate: The four Israeli soldiers inside the armoured vehicle pour out after tear gas cannister explode

Danger: The soldiers do their best to escape the stinging gas

Malfunction: The heavily-armed soldiers were forced to stop

Red-eyed, the servicemen lay on the ground after their escape, while cartridges and explosives spill over the floor.

The malfunction took place near the village of Bilin, in the centre of the West Bank areas. The soldiers had been chasing youths in the village after clashes between Israeli forces and the local population.

Burning: Tear gas is designed to irritate the eyes, mouth and lungs

Get down: One soldier donned a gas mask, while cartridges and explosive rounds spilled across the road

Tear gas is often used as a mean of crowd control. It irritates the eyes, nose, mouth and lungs and can cause difficulty breathing and temporary blindness as well as pain.

The soldiers would have been exposed to especially high concentrations inside their van.

Usually, the effects of tear gas wear off completely within half an hour, but in extreme cases victims' vision can be permanently damaged.
