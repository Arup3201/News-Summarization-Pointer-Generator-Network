The outspoken mother has made a name for herself in the British press for her controversial ramblings about obesity, hierarchy and children's names and her most recent musings have really riled up Hills. 

Hills scorned Hopkins on the popular show, lambasting her for being proud of her title as one of the most hated women in Britain and shaming her on TV for her harsh tweets.

Hopkins' tweets criticised the Scottish National Health Service for transporting a Scottish nurse suffering from Ebola to London for treatment.

'Glaswegian ebola patient moved to London's Royal Free Hospital. Not so independent when it matters most are we jocksville,' Hopkins' tweet said.

'Little sweaty jocks, sending us Ebola bombs in the form of sweaty Glaswegians just isn't cricket. Scottish NHS sucks,' Hopkins tweeted last month.

Hills hit back at the star, claiming he could not decide whether she was worse than convicted paedophile Rolf Harris due to her round of tweets.  

'You're not supposed to be proud of being the biggest bi*** in Britain, attention and love are not the same thing,' he said directly to the camera.

'Right now I can't decide whether you're a worse person than a convicted paedophile,'

'Until two days ago Rolf Harris would have garnered my vote as 'd*** of the year' but then a lady called Katie Hopkins sent a tweet.'

Hills continued, saying he hated bringing the woman's name up on his show as he knows that she 'feeds off' bad press.

'Katie Hopkins is what we would call in Australia a 'professional sh**-stirrer'. I'm loathe to even bring her up because I know she feeds off negative press. 

'I'm not going to call her a d*** purely because of this tweet, because somewhere north of here there's an entire nation of people who are using their own words to do it, and they are far better at swearing than me.'

Hopkins  has become famous for speaking her mind and causing outrage. She shot to the top of everyone's Facebook timeline when she criticised Peaches Geldof's parenting style in 2013.
