A dental nurse poisoned her boss's coffee with mercury after being disciplined for leaving a patient in the chair while she went out for lunch, a court has heard.

Ravinder Kaur, 35, allegedly spiked Laura Knowles’ hot drink with the metal used to make fillings in an act of ‘spite and revenge’.

Ms Knowles panicked and went as 'white as a ghost', in front of her colleagues at the Shams Moopen Dental Practice in Shefford, Bedfordshire, Blackfriars Crown Court heard.

Trial: Dental nurse Ravinder Kaur (left) is accused of poisoning her boss Laura Knowles' (right) coffee with capsules of the metal mercury. It is said the 35-year-old acted out of 'spite and revenge'

The practice manager was taken to hospital, after complaining stomach cramps after downing the noxious drink.

Prosecutor Laura Blackband told the court: ‘The Crown’s case is that Ms Kaur, acting out of spite or revenge, took a capsule or a number of capsules of mercury, and tipped it into a mug and handed the cup of coffee to Ms Knowles to drink.

‘Ms Knowles sipped the coffee halfway through when she realised something wasn’t right with it.

‘She tipped it and threw it away in the sink and saw it was mercury at the bottom.

‘Her reaction was panic - she thought she had been poisoned.

‘She went straight to the hospital suffering stomach cramps, some stomach pain, but luckily no long term effects.'

In the days before the incident Kaur had been disciplined for leaving a patient in a dental chair while she took her lunch break, the court was told.

There had been several ‘disagreements with colleagues’ and the dental nurse had been involved in a tribunal two months before she allegedly spiked her boss’s drink.

Laura Knowles was rushed to hospital with cramps. Kaur had twice been warned by bosses at Bedfordshire practice

‘Ms Kaur turned up for work at 8.45am and offered to make everyone a cup of tea or coffee,’ said Ms Blackband.

‘Six people were on the premises at the time - two of them were Ms Kaur and Ms Knowles - and Ms Kaur went round asking if everyone wanted a cup.

‘Only Ms Knowles accepted - for a cup of coffee’.

Kaur took a ‘very long time’ to make the drink and that when she returned she told workmates she had to change the water in the kettle, the court heard.

After Ms Knowles took gulped down half of the coffee she ran to the sink in the staffroom and poured the remainder of the drink away.

Jurors heard the liquid appeared to be much darker than coffee and also contained small pieces of metal.

Ms Blackband said Kaur, who had worked at the practice since November 2011, was experienced in using mercury and knew of the potentially deadly effects if swallowed.

Kaur from Bedford denies administering a noxious substance with intent to annoy, injure or aggrieve.

The trial continues.
