Two Australian gamers - who clearly have a lot of time on their hands - have converted an old ATM into a popular 1990s video game.

YouTuber Ed Jones and his mate Julian bought an old cash machine online and rewired it to play the cult first-person shooter game, Doom.

Complete with original sound effects and pictures, the transformed ATM then allows users to play the game using the machine's keypad as a makeshift control pad.

The elaborately hatched idea to convert an ATM into an Arcade game

The intricate operation uses a combination of video game and ATM wiring

Doom was developed for the humble computer back in the early 1990s and was a popular first-person sci-fi game

Their handiwork has been uploaded to YouTube, where viewers can see how much work has gone into remodeling the ATM to enable it to function as an arcade game machine.

During the clip they discuss the best way to translate the game's controls using the ATM keypad - so that users feel like they're moving, shooting and reloading as if they'd normally withdraw cash.

The side buttons, once operational, would become the 'weapons select' function and the receipt-spitting slot would be able to print a player's high score.

Ed Jones, or Aussie50 to his YouTube followers, said he bought the ATM as a package of four from Grays Online auctions for just $9 but hasn't disclosed his intentions for the other three.

The video game requires some tweaking in order to get the player back to the start once their game is finishedÂ 

According to his YouTube channel he is into making 'weekend hobby engineering/scrap metal recycling work' and his onterests include 'gas and diesel engines, electronics, TV and Audio, high voltage and retro PC gaming'.

He is perhaps better known as the man behind the video of the rotating washing machine which spun to the point it self destructed.

His friend Julian, a 'software developer' who goes by the name jgcertified, is also an active YouTube subscriber who is into PC related inventions.

He himself is no stranger with working with difficult hardware, previously designing the software for a billboard-sized LED screen mounted to the back of a truck to run the game Doom.
