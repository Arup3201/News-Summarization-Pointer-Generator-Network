Relatives of British tourists in Nepal face an anxious wait for news of their loved ones amid conflicting reports over exactly how many remain missing following the avalanche that killed at least 40 people.

As Nepalese search and rescue teams scaled back the hunt for survivors today it is understood that at least five British tourists known to be in Nepal remain unaccounted for.

However a spokesman for the Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal said he did not believe there were any more missing tourists although they were still looking for several local porters and tour guides.

A British newspaper reported this morning that up to 40 Britons could still be missing on the popular hiking trail around Annapurna, the world's tenth highest peak.

Online lists set up through social media  to help track down those tourists who have not been heard from since the devastating storm six days ago appear to have added to the confusion.

Today British nationals Peter Roddis and Andy Kimmerling were still being listed as missing on one website despite the fact they had contacted relatives over the weekend to report they were safe and well.

Others listed are known not to have been in the Annapurna trail but in other regions of Nepal.

Fears remain for  Britons Martin Warner, Katie Hill and Jay Devine who were in the area and are still unaccounted for.

Several others whose names appeared on that list have since contacted home to say they are safe and well – and, in some cases, that they were not near the disaster scene.

Jade House, from Liphook, Hampshire and her boyfriend Oliver De Paolis, from London, both 24, contacted their families to say they had been in another part of the Himalayas when disaster struck.

Nigel Vardy, 46, of Belper, Derbyshire – known as Mr Frostbite after losing his fingers on a previous adventure – has also contacted his family to say he is safe.

Unharmed: Peter Roddis, 26, an electrical engineer, from Hove, East Sussex, has contacted his family to say he was not in the mountains when disaster struck

Yesterday Briton Andrew Kimmerling, 54, who was on honeymoon in Nepal with his Danish wife Suzanne and had been feared dead, turned up safe and well.

Management consultant Mr Kimmerling, who moved to France 15 years ago from Cambridgeshire, contacted relatives by text and phone call to say that he and his wife are both fine.

Peter Roddis, 26,  from Hove, East Sussex, has contacted his family to say he was not in the mountains when disaster struck on the 150-mile trail, which loops round Annapurna, the world's tenth tallest peak.

The electrical engineer even contacted his local newspaper to thank them for describing him as an ‘adventurer’- because it made him 'sound cool'. 

Girlfriend Lisa Hallett said: 'Thankfully, Peter is safe and well and was not in danger at any point. There was a lot of confusion.' 

The Annapurna trail is around 150 miles long and much of the area does not have phone coverage meaning some trekkers simply may not have been able to check in with friends and relatives.

'Today is the last day of the search and rescue operation,' said Keshav Pandey of the Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal. 

'After this we can only hope that those who are missing will establish contact with us or their families.

'We don't think that any tourist is missing now. I am getting reports that some local porters and tour guides who were on the trek have not been traced so far.'

Small avalanches have today hampered the search for the remaining Nepali porters and guides missing for six days after a devastating Himalayan storm.

Nearly 600 people have been rescued from the popular hiking trail around Annapurna, the world's tenth highest peak, after it was hit by unseasonable snow and avalanches brought by the tail end of a cyclone that swept through neighbouring India.

The dead include Canadian, Indian, Israeli, Japanese, Nepalese, Polish and Slovak trekkers. Survivors said many people perished trying to descend in freezing whiteout conditions from the highest pass of the 240-km (150-mile) trail around Annapurna, which offers dramatic views of crags and hamlets.

Searchers retrieved another body on Monday, taking the tally of deaths to 40.

'Army rescuers dug out the body of an Israeli tourist from snow today,' Baburam Bhandari, chief of Nepal's Mustang district, one of the worst hit, told Reuters. 

Survivors of the tragedy told yesterday how they faced the life or death dilemma of whether to stay in a flimsy teahouse at 17,000ft or brave a killer blizzard.

Around 100 people, including many inexperienced trekkers, took refuge in the wooden shack after a sudden snowstorm on the popular Annapurna Circuit.

The teahouse's owner told trekkers they were putting their lives in danger if they stayed. 

He then declared he was shutting the shop near the Thorung La Pass and, it is claimed, demanded 1,000 Nepali rupees – around £6.30 – each to guide them to the nearest village, Muktinath.

Some decided to stay behind after he agreed to leave the lodge open and, despite a cold and hungry night, survived.

But most set off behind him and several died – amid claims he abandoned them when the deadly blizzards and avalanches took hold last week.

Yesterday Kobi Megreli, 24, an Israeli medical student who was among those who opted to stay in the teahouse, said: 'I don't trust someone who asks me for money to save my life.

'My friends who went with him told me the owner had left them halfway down. In the snow. In the storm. He left them because they were too exhausted to continue.'

The search for survivors of the devastating storm in which at least 39 people died was called off by rescuers in Nepal yesterday as they began focusing instead on looking for bodies trapped in the snow.

The Foreign Office said yesterday that it has still received no information about any British injured or dead.

Mr Megreli told The Sunday Times of the terrible dilemma in the teahouse after he was discharged from a hospital in Kathmandu, the Nepalese capital, with only minor injuries.

He and the others who refused to pay to be led down the mountain made it to safety the next morning after 'huddling together for warmth' and not sleeping for fear of hypothermia. They walked to an area where military helicopters flew them to Kathmandu.

Eitan Edan, 31, an Israeli social worker who followed the teahouse owner but survived and is being treated for frostbite, said: 'They let us think we had to walk if we wanted to stay alive, but everyone who stayed in the teashop lived.' Four of his friends died, he added.

The fate of the teahouse owner was not clear last night.

Reports locally said Pasang Tamang, a porter who had earlier been hired by some of those in the teahouse to help them on the trek, was hailed a hero after dying having rescued more than 20 stranded people during the descent.

But some survivors have claimed the 45-year-old father of two, who was reportedly paid £9 a day, made a deal with the teahouse owner to share the trekkers' 'escape payments'. He died of suffocation and exhaustion during the descent.

His employer, Laxman Ghimire, said 22,500 rupees (£141) and $100 was recovered from his body, which he had earned on his previous trek.

British police sergeant Paul Sherridan helped over 100 trekkers down the mountain 

A British policeman who was hailed a hero after leading more than 100 trekkers to safety during the Nepal avalanche disaster has joked how his wife threatened to kill him when he got home.

Sergeant Paul Sherridan, 49, was praised for keeping a cool head when he found himself in white-out conditions in the Annapurna range last week.

Only after he began helping a small party back to safety did he realise that dozens of stranded and freezing walkers were also following him down.

Speaking at a press conference in Sheffield today he said: 'I rang my wife Lesley and said there’s been a bit of an incident in Nepal and you might hear about it in the news. I might have used up one of my nine lives.

'She said "you wait till you get home here, you might lose the other eight".'

Sergeant Sherridan, from Doncaster, put his success down to his calm exterior which helped others stay positive,

He added: 'I was a swan sitting on top of the water but underneath my feet were kicking and going mad.

'Throughout my time as a police officer I have been trained in leading groups in mountainous conditions. 

'I had a sense that if I didn’t move I would die. We started to move together and it became apparent we were descending into worse conditions. Everything was featureless and the wind was so ferocious nothing could be heard - imagine having a hairdryer bellowing into your ears.

'I didn’t know if we were going up or down, right or left. The longer I waited I was going to get hypothermia. I realised these people were dropping off one by one.

The officer told how he found a Nepalese guide and asked him to try and identify distinguishable landmarks to help them find their way to safety.

'He was the only person who could help us. I said to him: "I want you to look around the greyness and blackness see if you can recognise anything".

'We saw a pole and I realised that was going to be the way. I said to everyone: "make sure you can see the person in front of you and the person behind" - so we moved to the pole and with each navigation point we moved further down the mountain. 

'I turned around and there was 100 plus people just coming down the mountain. I realised it was not just me and a few other people - there were a lot more.'
