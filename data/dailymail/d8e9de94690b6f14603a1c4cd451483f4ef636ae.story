Oscar Pistorius may not get early release from his gang-ridden jail where he is fed rations of buttered bread because the electronic tagging device cannot be fitted securely to his prosthetic leg, it emerged today.

The revelation came as South African prosecutors said their request to appeal the athlete's manslaughter conviction and five-year prison sentence would be heard on December 9.

The runner had hoped he would qualify for home detention curfew with a tag after serving just ten months of his sentence.

But MailOnline can reveal that prison bosses have told him he can't take part in their tagging scheme because the device cannot be properly monitored if it is fixed to a prosthetic leg.

The tags cannot by law be fixed to an offender's wrists as they are too easily removed.

Blow: Oscar Pistorius is comforted by his lawyer Barry Roux during his sentencing for the manslaughter of Reeva Steenkamp. His hopes of early release from a five-year jail sentence have been dashed after prison officials said their electronic tagging scheme cannot be properly monitored if it is fixed to his prosthetic leg

Cannot be used on false limbs: The Paralympian is pictured in 2008 taking off his prosthetic running shoes and putting on his special blades which he uses to compete in. Prison officials said the electronic tag which monitor parolees cannot by law be fixed to an offender's wrists as they are too easily removed

Pistorius, 27, had both legs amputated as a child and relies on prosthetic legs for his mobility. 

South Africa's Correctional Services Department started a pilot scheme for tagging offenders in April. 

Pistorius told his defence team he believed he was a suitable case with no previous convictions for violence.

But prison sources said yesterday: 'The device has to be attached physically to the offender's ankle. 

'We cannot use it on false limbs which could be left somewhere static while the offender goes missing.'

Pistorius had hoped to leave his cell in the hospital wing of Pretoria's Kgosi Mampuru prison to spend the remainder of his sentence at his uncle's luxury home in the city's Waterkloof suburb where there is a gym and swimming pool.

He was living with his wealthy uncle Arnold and family members throughout his seven-month trial for the killing of blonde model Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day last year. 

He fired four shots at her through the door of a locked toilet cubicle in the early hours of the morning.

In a sensational case which shocked TV viewers worldwide as it was filmed live in the West Gauteng High Court, Pistorius wept and howled his way through evidence during six days in the witness box, denying that he intentionally killed 29-year-old Miss Steenkamp.

He was acquitted of premeditated murder and of the South African judicial category 'dolus eventualis' – meaning he foresaw the result of his actions – but was convicted of culpable homicide and sentenced to five years.

Last month, the National Prosecuting Authority announced it would apply for leave to appeal against his conviction and sentence, claiming that he should have been found guilty of 'dolus eventualis' and received a heavier sentence.

Meanwhile, Pistorius is being kept in isolation – in the same prison cell where South Africa's disgraced former Police Commissioner Jackie Selebi was locked up for 229 days at the start of his 15-year sentence for fraud and corruption in August 2010. 

He had taken bribes from convicted drug dealer Glenn Agliotti who was given immunity from prosecution to give evidence against him.

The case against respected anti-apartheid struggle hero Selebi rocked South Africa. He had been President of Interpol at the time of his arrest.

During his incarceration, he suffered a collapse from a kidney disease and was discharged on medical parole to serve the remainder of his sentence at home.

Selebi had been placed in the isolation cell for his own protection against maximum security prisoners who are notoriously led by the murderous Numbers gangs.

Now Pistorius is in Selebi's former cell due to similar worries over his safety and security.

But he enjoys few luxuries despite the extra protection. He has no TV in his cell and is not allowed a mobile phone. 

His day starts at 5.30am when he washes, dresses and tidies up his cell.

He has two sets of bright orange prison overalls and has been allowed to keep his own white T-shirts and tracksuits.

Breakfast of porridge with coffee or juice is brought to him at 7am. 

Pistorius is said to be quiet and calm in prison after an initial meltdown during his first few days when other inmates heard him sobbing himself to sleep. 

Prison sources say that his current mood seems to be one of relief. He has been told that, even without release on a tagging system, he may be able to apply for parole after 10 months.

His cell is two metres by three metres in size with a grill and a solid steel door. He has a small cupboard, a bed with a sponge mattress and two blankets, a wash-basin and toilet.

He shares a shower room with the prisoner in the adjoining cell and maintenance men are currently busy installing a bath for them. 

Fearing the worst: Pistorius was clearly aware of the dangers of prison life as he stood for sentencing at the end of his trial. When police led him down the stairs to the holding cells, he discreetly slipped his expensive designer watch into his uncle Arnold's hand (above) as they reached out to each other for a few seconds

Pistorius is spending long periods reading the Gideon Bible given to him on admission and will be able to borrow other books from the prison library once he has ventured out.

His cell opens onto a small bare courtyard and he is able to speak to the prisoner in the neighbouring cell.

He is said to be eating the same food as other inmates, but will be allowed to also buy pies, hot dogs, sweets and chocolates from the prison tuck shop using money given to him by family visitors.

At midday, he is brought a basic meal which includes meat of some kind with carbohydrates and vegetables.

The last meal of the day is slices of buttered bread with a hot drink, served at 4pm. All the prison food is prepared in one huge kitchen catering for 7,000 inmates.

Pistorius is expected to take part in rehabilitation programmes, which could mean him giving exercise classes to other prisoners. 

But so far he is reluctant to intermingle for reasons easy to understand.

The hospital wing contains nine other inmates, among them suspected mafia hitman Radovan Krejcir, a fugitive from the former Czechoslovakia. Pistorius was briefly introduced to them when he arrived.

He is currently undergoing a 21-day risks and needs assessment and will later be obliged to join rehab or skills-training courses in the prison workshops.

Pistorius is a Group A prisoner, a category extended to convicted police officers, soldiers, elderly prisoners and the sick. 

He is not considered to be a danger to others, and the category provides him certain privileges such as the right to weekly visits of one hour's duration from friends or family members. They can also bring him food parcels.

Correctional Services Department spokesperson Sibongile Khumalo admitted that his category means 'he has some form of preferential treatment for his own safety'.

Pistorius was clearly aware of the dangers of prison life as he stood for sentencing at the end of his trial. 

When police led him down the stairs to the holding cells, he discreetly slipped his expensive designer watch into his uncle Arnold's hand as they reached out to each other for a few seconds. 

The National Prosecuting Authority had described Pistorius sentence for killing Reeva Steenkamp as 'shockingly light' when it announced its intention to appeal the manslaughter verdict.

His legal team has opposed the move, setting the stage for a hearing before the North Gauteng High Court in Pretoria in a month.
