Prince Philip appeared to have a bleeding cut on his ear today, fuelling speculation that he might have hurt himself.

The injury was visible as he followed his normal routine of walking 400 yards from Sandringham House to the morning service at St Mary Magdalene Church.

Wearing his customary long brown overcoat, the 83-year-old who is renowned for his robust fitness did not show any sign of being concerned by the wound.

The injury didn't seem to bother the royal, who was in good spirits as he travelled to the venue on foot 

He chatted and smiled as normal to a crowd of onlookers and paused to exchange a joke with a policeman who saluted him.

While Prince Philip walked to the church, the Queen was taken to the venue in her Bentley.   

Her Majesty radiated in a bright fuchsia outfit, which she accessorised the quirky hat and coat with a beautiful pink and silver brooch, a pair of plain pearl earrings and a cerise lipstick. 

She has been staying an her 20,000-acre East Anglian home with Prince Philip since the Christmas break and regularly visits the nearby church for the Sunday sermon.

Several locals waited outside the place of worship to welcome the royal couple, despite the cold temperatures. 

They still have almost two weeks weeks in the countryside before they are expected to return to London.

The couple usually make their return trip within a day or two of Accession Day on February 6, which is the day that her Majesty took over the throne from her father in 1952.

The Queen will have been enjoying the winter break - while she has reduced the number of formal engagements she makes recently, other areas of her work have expanded. 

According to The Sun newspaper, demand for her 100th birthday telegrams are said to be soaring.

She has been advertising for an assistant anniversaries officer to help with birthday messages and diamond wedding anniversaries. 

The Queen has been staying an her 20,000-acre East Anglian home with Prince Philip since the Christmas break and regularly visits the nearby church for the Sunday sermon.

The newspaper has revealed that fewer than 3,000 congratulatory telegrams were sent out in 1952, compared to 9,736 birthday wishes in 2011.

Her Majesty also sent 30,359 diamond wedding letters.

During her reign the newspaper says the Queen has sent more than 110,000 birthday messages and 520,000 diamond wedding notes.

An advertisement for the job reads: 'You will be responsible for dealing with requests from the public to ensure all eligible recipients receive The Queen's congratulatory card.'
