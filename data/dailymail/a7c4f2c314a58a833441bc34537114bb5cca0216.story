Jailed: Shane Hobbs was jailed for 16 months for the attacks on women which was caught on CCTV

A serial groper has been jailed for sexually assaulting a student during a drunken night spent trying to molest groups of women.

Shane Hobbs, 26, was captured on CCTV laughing as he walked away from his shocked victim after thrusting his fist down her trousers.

Cameras followed Hobbs as he staggered through Exeter city centre lunging and fondling several women enjoying a night out, the court heard.

The attack on the Chinese student from Exeter University left her too frightened to go out at night, Exeter Crown Court was told.

Hobbs, of Dawlish Warren, Devon, was jailed for 16 months after admitting sexual assault on one woman and common assault on a second during the incident in February, this year.

Judge Phillip Wassall said the offences were so serious, only immediate custody was appropriate.

He said: ‘You approached two Exeter University students, who were both Chinese, and out for a quiet night in Exeter. You got right in her face and your hand went down her back.

‘You touched her bottom and you reached inwards and put your hand into the area of her private parts. The victim says she was caused shock and a small amount of pain for five minutes.

‘This was plainly not touching in an instant and although it was over in ten seconds or so it was a very serious incident carried out quite deliberately in your drunken state.

He added: ‘It left her very frightened and unwilling to go out because she wondered if something like it could happen again.

‘It must have been particularly distressing because she was so far away from home and had come here from different shores.

‘It did not end there. You approached another group of girls and got one around the neck and tried to drag her to the ground. You slipped off her and allowed her to walk on.

‘I regard the sexual assault in drink against a complete stranger as being very serious.

Mr Alex Allsop, prosecuting, showed the judge the CCTV footage taken at 8.30 pm at night which showed the first assault outside the Tesco Metro in Queen Street.

Hobbs had already lurched at one woman and he then held out his arms to stop the victim and her friend before putting an arm around her and moving to her bottom.

The CCTV then followed him as he walked onto High Street and accosted two more women, talking to them as he walked with them and then hurling an arm around the shoulders of one of them.

They both staggered for a few moments and she pulled herself away from him and hurried off while he wandered around before falling over and lying in the middle of the road.

He said: ‘Hobbs was arrested and told police he could remember nothing about the assault because he had fallen out with his girlfriend and been drinking.

‘He apologised for his behaviour and said he knows he gets stupid when he has been drinking. He said he’d had at least ten pints with shots and Jager bombs.’

Mr James Taghdissian, defending, said Hobbs was so ashamed of his actions he could not watch the CCTV footage and covered his eyes when shown it by police.

He said: ‘This was out of character. He does not normally act in this way. It was ten seconds of wholly inappropriate behaviour which has led him to court faced with this serious offence.’
