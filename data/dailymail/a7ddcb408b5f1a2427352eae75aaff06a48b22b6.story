A schoolboy has died after suffering an asthma attack 15 minutes into football practice.

Ten-year-old Cameron Good, from Hardane, East Yorkshire, was training with his club AFC Kingston Panthers when he began to struggle to breathe.

The schoolboy fell into a coma after suffering a massive asthma attack and never regained consciousness.

Four days later, after a brain scan revealed huge damage, his parents Stacy Suddaby and Craig Good agreed for his life support machine to be turned off.

Miss Suddaby, 29, said: 'When asthma strikes, it doesn't mess around. It killed our son within 15 minutes.

Cameron Good, 10, collapsed and fell into a coma after suffering a massive asthma attack while football training. Four days later his parents made the devastating decision to switch off his life support machine.

'People underestimate this condition. When people think of asthma they just think of a little blue inhaler, but it can kill.'

Cameron, who lived with his mother in Hardane, Hull, East Yorkshire, was a Year 5 pupil at the estate's St Anthony's Catholic Primary School.

Keen footballer Cameron was diagnosed with asthma when he was two, but doctors had reassured his parents it was safe for him to play sport. 

Miss Suddaby said her son had seemed in good health when she had taken him to his weekly football practice,  at 5.50pm on Wednesday, November 26.

'Cameron had been fine all day,' she said.

'He had not been wheezing. There was nothing to suggest anything was wrong.

'He was faffing about with his football boots when we got there, before going outside with the others. Me and the other parents were sitting inside, while the boys trained.

'About 15 minutes later, Cameron's coach brought him in and said Cameron was struggling to breathe.'

His parents now want to raise awareness of the condition, which kills three people a day in the UK. 

Miss Suddaby, who is separated from her son's father, says she asked her son's coach how many times her son had used his inhaler.

'Cameron had only had four pumps of the inhaler,' she said. 'The advice parents get is call 999 if they have had ten pumps, or if they have lost consciousness.

'He was still conscious at this point. I made sure he had ten pumps.

'Cameron told me, "Mam, I need an ambulance. I can't breathe".

Cameron, from Hardane, East Yorkshire, was training with his club AFC Kingston Panthers at Kingswood Academy in Bransholme (pictured) when he began to struggle to breathe. He fell unconscious after suffering an asthma attack and never came to

'He'd had attacks and panicked before, but he'd never asked for an ambulance. He was begging me. He was going white.

'Someone called an ambulance. A few minutes later, Cameron turned blue. He then lost consciousness and never came around.'

Two of the other mothers attempted CPR while waiting for paramedics, but Miss Suddaby said it took 13 minutes for the ambulance to arrive, because of heavy commuter traffic.

'I was trying to stay calm,' she said. 'I was talking to him. I didn't know if he could still hear me. I didn't want to panic him.'

Paramedics were helped by a consultant anaesthetist who had been having a guitar lesson at the school.

Cameron's heart was restarted on the way to Hull Royal Infirmary. He was then transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit at Leeds General Infirmary during the early hours. 

Miss Suddaby said: 'A scan showed extensive brain damage.

'We were told if, by some slim chance, he woke up from the coma, he would not be able to do anything by himself.'

Miss Suddaby said she and Mr Good had a horrific decision to make.

'Agreeing to turn off a life support machine is the worst decision any parent has to make,' she said.

'We wanted him to be that miracle boy. I wanted newspapers knocking on the door because he had made a miraculous recovery.'

Cameron died on Sunday, November 30. Leading tributes to her son, Miss Suddaby said: 'Cameron was a proper little mammy's boy.'

Mr Good, 36, said: 'Cameron was so funny. He was an amazing boy and I was so proud of him.'
