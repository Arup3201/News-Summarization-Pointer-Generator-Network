Arjen Robben was labelled a cheat after winning the penalty that allowed Holland to complete an amazing World Cup comeback against Mexico in Brazil.

Holland trailed with two minutes left but a stunning strike from Wesley Sneijder and then a penalty won by Robben and converted by Klaas Jan Huntelaar saw them triumph 2-1 to head in to the quarter-finals next weekend.

Opinion was split over whether Robben was fouled but Mexico coach Miguel Herrera was in no doubt and accused Portuguese referee Pedro Proenca of bias.

'Out of four matches we had three where the refereeing was disastrous and this was the worst,' said Herrerra.

'Robben did three dives for penalties that didn’t exist. He had to be cautioned.

'If you do that to the guy who tries to cheat, then he can’t cheat again.

'Robben
 should have got a second card. If you don’t do anything as a referee, 
the player carries on. He knows he won’t be expelled from the pitch so 
he carries on.

'But then when they send a referee from the same confederation where they have a team, this is what happens.

'The referee gave a penalty that was invented by him.

'The least we can hope is that this gentleman goes home just like us.'

Afterwards,
 Robben admitted diving to try and win a free-kick in the first half but
 claimed the decisive incident late on was a foul.

'I
 must apologise,' he said. 'The one [at the end] was a penalty, but the 
other one was a dive in the first half. I shouldn't be doing that. 
That’s awul.

'I’m almost 
crying from the emotions. The feeling is so strong, we want to win this,
 to fight together. These youngsters make me so proud.'

Due
 to the extreme heat in Fortaleza, FIFA allowed the teams to 
have water breaks after 30 and 75 minutes. Van Gaal claimed he used the 
second one to change his tactics and bring about victory.

The new Manchester United manager said: ' First I had changed to 4-3-3 and we created a lot of opportunities.

'Then I moved to plan B and yes I did that in the cooling break. That’s a clever way of benefiting from these breaks.'

Herrera ended his press conference yesterday by suggesting Holland wouldn’t go much further in the tournament.

'We had the match in our hands,' the Mexico coach added.

'Having been the coach of these extraordinary group of players, you raise you head, you walk tall.

'This World Cup will remain in history and we did  things that keep us going.

'Netherlands are a team that can be attacked easily.'
