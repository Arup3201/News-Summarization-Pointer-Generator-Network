Maho Beach in Saint Martin is known globally for its close encounters with airplanes.

But that doesn't make the phenomenon any less incredible, as this video taken by a recent tourist to the destination shows.

Approaching Princess Juliana International Airport, the aircraft is captured in slow motion as it makes its final approach, which makes the footage even more amazing.

The aircraft is captured in slow motion as it approaches Princess Juliana International Airport in Saint Martin

As its shadow engulfs the beach, the sheer size of the aircraft dwarfs the tourists underneath it, who pose for photographs and watch in awe.

Seemingly closer than usual, the wheels look like they could be touched as turning heads follow its movement and numerous tablets and smart phones capture its landing.

Passing the fence and arriving inside the airport, the plane’s wheels appear to narrowly miss a taxi, which drives on by as if nothing ever happened.

Maho Beach is located on the Dutch side of the Caribbean island of Saint Martin, in the territory of Sint Maarten.

Aircraft are forced to land so close to the beach so as to touch down near the start of the short Runway 10, which is 2,300 metres in length.

As a result the area is popular with plane spotters and many of the surrounding bars and restaurants on the beach display airline departure and arrival timetables.

Planes are required to fly low when approaching the airport so as to get as close to the start of the short Runway 10
