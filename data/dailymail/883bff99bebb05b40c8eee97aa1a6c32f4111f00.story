Vogue creative director Grace Coddington was temporarily banned from Instagram over the weekend for her first post on the platform - a self-portrait sketch of her bathing topless.

Ms Coddington, 73, known by fashion fans for her starring role in the 2009 documentary The September Issue, joined Instagram on Friday and quickly accumulated a few thousand followers.

But by the weekend, her account had gone dark – purportedly due to the sketch, which was created to promote online auctioneer Paddle 8’s ‘No Clothes’ charity auction.

Instagram, of course, has a strict no-nudity policy that has led to similar bans placed on accounts from Rihanna and model Anja Rubik.

Today however, Ms Coddington’s account was restored. Instagram claims that its blocking of Ms Coddington’s account was an accident, and that the app’s personnel made a mistake while processing a complaint against the photo.

A representative for Instagram told The Cut: ‘When our team processes reports from other members of the Instagram community, we occasionally make a mistake.

‘In this case, we wrongly removed content and worked to rectify the error as soon as we were notified. We apologize for any inconvenience.’

In the brief time that her Instagram was dark shut down, at least one member of fashion’s elite shared an Instagram post to show their support for her.

W magazine fashion director Edward Enninful posted a photo of the cover for Ms Coddington’s first book, Grace, writing: ‘Grace Coddington's Instagram is no longer active because of her 1st post, the nude self portrait!!!!!! Grace will be back soon with a new account xoxo Stay posted! #gracecoddington #legend’

Now with her account back in working order, Ms Coddington has posted a new sketch to address her profile’s shut down.

Hitting back: After her account was restored, Ms Coddington uploaded this sketch in which her famous cats are facetiously blacked out

Earlier today she posted one of her famous cat sketches with a black bar facetiously drawn over one of the feline’s lower halves.

Its cheeky caption read: ‘Good grief Pumpkin, Mother drew a nude selfie for her very first Instagram. No wonder they shut her down......she is much fatter than that.’
