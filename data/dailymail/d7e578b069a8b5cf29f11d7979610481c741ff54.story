Nick Clegg today tore into the BBC for offering Premier League footballer pay deals to top staff.

The Deputy Prime Minister warned the Corporation’s reputation has been ‘badly tarnished’ by the spectacle of executives trying to dodge the blame for signing off severance deals worth up to £1million.

He said the use of taxpayers’ money to lavish huge salaries on BBC bosses meant they now had a ‘mountain to climb’ to restore public trust.

Criticism: Nick Clegg said the BBC now has a 'mountain to climb' to restore public trust in the Corporation

Mr Clegg is the latest senior minister to lambast the Corporation for its handling of the pay-off scandal.

On Monday, seven current and former BBC chiefs were called before MPs to explain why it handed £369million in severance deals to its staff, including £25million to 150 top managers.

During almost three hours of furious questioning in Parliament, former Director-General Mark Thompson and BBC Trust Lord Patten repeatedly contradicted each other, notably over a £1million settlement for ex-deputy Director-General Mark Byford. 

MPs demanded to know why Mr Byford received double the £500,00 to which he was contractually entitled.

The executives were called back to Parliament after giving different accounts about how the deals were agreed, and Mr Thompson, now chief executive of the New York Times, challenging claims by the BBC Trust that they were kept in the dark.

Mr Clegg condemned the size of the pay deals funded from the licence fee: ‘These are figures are just very, very high.

'This is taxpayers’ money going into the BBC and they can’t in a sense treat these payoffs like you might treat a pay-off for a Premier League footballer.

'They’re not in that category. These are public servants at the end of the day so I do think actually the BBC’s reputation - and I say this with real sorrow because I am a huge defender and advocate of the BBC - but the reputation’s been pretty badly tarnished this week.'

Speaking on his LBC 97.3 radio phone-in, Mr Clegg said this week’s committee hearing had rocked his faith in the Corporation.

‘I’m a big, big supporter of the BBC. It’s recognised around the world as being an organisation that produces great drama, great programming, great news,’ he said.

‘But I have to say that they haven’t covered themselves in glory with one bit of the BBC saying one thing, the other bit saying something.

‘The left hand doesn’t seem to know what the right hand is saying.’

Dispute: BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten blamed a
'culture' of extravagance at the Corporation which was used to justify 
huge pay and perks

Kicking off Monday's committee evidence session, Ms 
Hodge said it was an 'extraordinary occasion' for seven former and 
serving BBC executives to have to be called back to Parliament.

Mr Thompson and Lord Patten were 
called to appear with BBC HR director Lucy Adams, Marcus Agius, the 
former chairman of the BBC Executive Board Remuneration Committee, BBC 
director Nicholas Kroll, BBC Trustee Anthony Fry and former BBC Trust 
chairman Sir Michael Lyons.

Ms Hodge said she hoped to 'establish 
on behalf of both the public and licence-fee payer who knew what and at 
what time and who is responsible for decisions taken by the BBC'.

She said the deals led to ‘grossly excessive payments which most people now consider to be unacceptable’.

One caller challenged Mr Clegg over whether the pay-offs breached the Bribery Act, but the Deputy PM insisted ‘any allegations of criminality [are] something for the police’.

‘But the wider point about needing to restore public trust in the way in which the BBC is run, the way in which people are remunerated, the way in which are paid off at the end of their contracts…

‘Just to state the flaming obvious: the BBC have now got quite a mountain to climb to restore public trust in the way these things are handled.’

His comments come after Culture Secretary Maria Miller said the payouts raise ‘serious questions’ about the judgement of those in charge at the BBC.

In a major speech to the RTS Television Convention last night, Mrs Miller said: ‘Monday was a grim day for its senior management.

‘There is a risk of events like this overshadowing the unstinting work of its staff.

‘This must not be allowed to happen. The corporate dramas of the BBC should never eclipse its actual dramas.’

In a further sign of government pressure on the BBC to get its house in order, she cleared the way for the National Audit Office to probe any area of its extravagant spending ‘without hindrance or delay’.

She also warned that the BBC Trust structure remained under constant review.

But Mr Clegg today insisted he did not back the idea of axing the Trust and handing regulation of the BBC to Ofcom.

He added: ‘The Trust now needs to work very hard indeed and urgently to restore confidence in the way in which it discharges its duties.’

Defensive: Former Director-General Mark Thompson said he increased the pauout to Mark Buford by almost £500,000 to keep him focused on his job

Ex-Director-General Mark 
Thompson today claimed his friend and deputy Mark Byford needed to be 
paid £949,000 to remain 'focussed' on his job at the BBC.

MPs demanded to know why the huge sum was agreed, when contractually Mr Byford was only entitled to £500,000.

Mr Thompson denied there was any 'favouritism' in his decision to agree the deal.

Mr Thompson told the committee that in
his view Mr Byford's severance package represented 'value for money' 
and he explained that he had been under 'ferocious pressure' from the 
Trust to make savings.

As part of the extraordinary deal, it
was decided in October 2010 that Mr Byford would not be told formally 
that he was being made redundant until April the following year, 
allowing him to continue drawing on his salary.

Mr
Thompson said the huge sum was needed because the BBC wanted Mr Byford 
to be 'fully focused' on his work during his last months in the job and 
not 'worried about his future'.

But
former Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons agreed with the MPs that 
payments like Mr Byford's 'look eye-watering' and he warned the Trust 
had been 'damaged' but the crisis.

Grilling: BBC Trust chairman Lord Patten walks through the Houses of Parliament to the hearing at the Public Accounts Committee

Lord Patten said he had been 
repeatedly told the £949,000 deal for Mark Byford to leave the BBC was 
'contractual' and 'standard'.

The
BBC Trust chairman told the committee: 'I am in a slightly difficult 
position because I became chairman of the Trust six months after the 
Byford payment.

'I'm accused of having misled the committee on something that I never knew and couldn't have been expected to know.'

He
said he had been through his induction pack from May 2011 and 
subsequent briefings, and there was no mention of the controversial 
severance payments.

One 
briefing ahead of a press conference stated: 'These were contractual 
payments which were essential in order to slim down the executive 
board.'

Lord Patten 
complained that it is 'Mark's contention' that he should somehow have 
deduced that the payment to Mr Byford was in excess of his contractual 
minimum.

He blamed a 
'cultural issue' for the slate of payouts at the Corporation which 'we 
do have to recognise and apologise for and deal with very robustly'.

He
said one of his first jobs was a meeting to discuss executive pay where
he made 'a very simple point that the best cultural director in the 
world, Neil MacGregor, got £180,000 a year for running the British 
Museum. How many people at the BBC get paid more than that and how can 
we justify that?'.

Lord 
Patten cast doubt on a proposal that communications watchdog Ofcom 
should regulate the corporation, saying: 'I can't imagine handing the 
regulatory power to Ofcom and Ofcom wanting to be involved in 
remuneration.'
