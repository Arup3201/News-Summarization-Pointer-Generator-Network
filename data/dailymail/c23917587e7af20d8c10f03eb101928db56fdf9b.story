Tragic: The killing of Wpc Yvonne Fletcher sparked an 11 day police siege of the Libyan embassy in St James's Square

Two detectives have visited Libya as part of the ongoing investigation into the murder of WPc Yvonne Fletcher.

The killer of the police officer who was shot outside the Libyan embassy in London in 1984 was never 
convicted, but now 28 years on there are fresh hopes that her family may
finally see justice.

The officers, from the Metropolitan Police’s Counter Terrorism Command, flew to Tripoli where they met Libyan officials to discuss how the investigation can be taken forward in the future.

In a statement the force said: 'We hope these preliminary discussions will pave the way for the MPS and Libyan authorities to work jointly to identify who was responsible for WPc Fletcher’s murder in 1984.'

The officers - a detective superintendent and a detective inspector - travelled to the nation’s capital on Monday and returned to the UK last night.

They will remain in regular contact with WPc Fletcher’s family who will be given an update about the visit, the force said.

WPc Fletcher, who was 25, was shot dead as she policed an anti-Gaddafi demonstration outside the Libyan People’s Bureau in April 1984.

The bullets which killed her and injured 10 protesters came from inside the embassy.

Her killing triggered an 11 day police 
siege of the embassy in St James's Square and the UK cut all diplomatic 
ties with the Middle East nation.

Last month Libyan prime minister Abdurrahim El-Keib today made a historic visit to the spot where the young officer was shot dead.

Changing times: David Cameron said allowing British police to fly to Libya investigate WPc Fletcher's killing was a really positive step. Diplomatic relations were cut with Libyan leader Muammar Gadaffi, right, following the incident in 1984

David Cameron said the visit was a 
'really positive step forward' in the inquiry into the 1984 killing of 
the officer, who was shot dead as she policed an anti-Gaddafi 
demonstration outside the Libyan Embassy in London.

Ms Fletcher's mother Queenie, father Tim and sister Sarah Parsons have been hoping to see justice for their daughter ever since.

In
2009 the family and friends of Yvonne gathered at a memorial in her 
honour at St James's square, the spot where she was killed, to 
commemorate the 25th anniversary of her death.

Mr
Cameron made the announcement as the north African state's interim 
Prime Minister Abdurrahim El-Keib visited 10 Downing Street.

Mr
El-Keib promised that his country would 'work very closely together' 
with the UK to resolve outstanding questions about the killing of the 
25-year-old Wpc Fletcher, who was part of a team of 30 officers sent to 
St. James's Square to keep the peace during a demonstration by Libyan 
dissidents opposed to the rule of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.

It is believed she was hit by a shot fired from within the People's Bureau.

Mr
El-Keib worked with the opposition while in exile during Muammar 
Gaddafi's dictatorship, and said he knew some of those involved in the 
demonstration.

He told Mr 
Cameron: 'The Fletcher case is a case that is close to my heart 
personally. I had friends who were demonstrating that day next to the 
embassy.'

'It is a sad story. It is very unfortunate that it has anything to do with the Libyan people.

'I am here to tell you that we will work very closely together to resolve anything related to that issue.'

Hopes of finding the killer of Wpc Fletcher were first raised following the revolution which toppled the dictator last year.

But so far, plans to send a police team to Libya had been frustrated by a failure to secure approval from local authorities.

Officers from New Scotland Yard and Home Office Minister James Brokenshire met Mr El-Keib today to discuss the Fletcher case.

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism said he was determined to get justice for Ms Fletcher.

He added: 'We have never lost our resolve to solve this murder and achieve justice for Yvonne's family. We see today's announcement as significant.'

Detectives remain in regular contact with WPc Fletcher's family and update them on developments.

Mr El-Keib said Libya wanted to be 'long-term friends and partners' with Britain, and paid tribute to the role which the UK played in the international military mission to protect civilians from Gaddafi's forces during last year's uprising.

Addressing Mr Cameron he said: 'You took a bold decision when it was very difficult for many to even consider supporting the Libyan people. You took that decision which inspired many of us.'

Mr Cameron said: 'I am very proud of the role that Britain played to help secure a successful outcome in Libya and the support we gave through the Nato mission.

'I am very much looking forward to hearing about the progress towards a full democracy in Libya and the elections which you hope to hold before Ramadan this year.'
