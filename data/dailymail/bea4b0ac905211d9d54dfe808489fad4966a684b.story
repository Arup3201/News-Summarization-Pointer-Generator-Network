These amazing crab's-eye-view photographs show the power of a Laysan albatross taking flight in the North Pacific.

The pictures were captured by wildlife photographer Paul McKenzie on Midway Island and show the magnificent birds which can have a wingspan of up to 13ft.

The peaceful oasis is home up to two million seabirds and migrating shorebirds - most of which are Laysan albatrosses.

Mr McKenzie said: 'Unlike many other albatross species which nest on windswept cliff faces and cliff tops and are able to take flight by literally launching themselves off the cliffs, Midway is a lowly elevated atoll and the birds require a running start to take flight.

'On Midway, there is a natural sandy runway lined by native Naupakia bushes down which the albatrosses run at high speed to gain flight.

'To take these next images, I partially buried cameras with fish-eye lenses in the sand, encased in Ziploc bags and with manual wireless remote triggers attached.

'I then retreated behind a nearby bush, out of sight of the onrushing birds and waited until they were just in front of the camera lens before manually tripping the shutter.

'Given the speed that the birds travelled and their large size, capturing images that contained the whole bird was extremely difficult and many hundreds of images need to be taken in order to yield a handful of keepers.'

Approximately half-a-million breeding adults use Midway as a base to court, breed and raise chicks every year and it accounts for about three quarters of the world's population of Laysan albatrosses.

Like all Albatross species, Laysans mate for life.

Mates: In order to find their partner, young Albatrosses spend a number of years refining and perfecting an elaborate courtship dance

In order to find their partner, young albatrosses spend a number of years refining and perfecting an elaborate courtship dance.

The females lay a single egg and the adults will stay together nurturing the chick.

Eventually one or both of the parents will head out to sea to forage for squid, fish eggs and small fish.

On return they are greeted by a ravenous chick which typically receives a gullet-full of regurgitated squid paste.
