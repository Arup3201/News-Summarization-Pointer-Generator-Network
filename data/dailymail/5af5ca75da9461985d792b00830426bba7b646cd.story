Christopher Tappin, 65, always maintained his innocence, saying he was a victim of an FBI sting. It is now claimed he will change his verdict

A former golf club president extradited to the US on charges of trying to sell missile batteries to Iran is set to plead guilty – and could be back in the UK within months.

Christopher Tappin, 65, is expected to return to Britain to serve his sentence if a plea bargain deal with US prosecutors goes ahead.

Last night his wife said she hoped the agreement would lead to his ‘swift and safe return’.

Elaine Tappin, who is seriously ill with chronic Churg-Strauss syndrome, a rare auto-immune disease, said: ‘From the moment Chris was put on a plane all we ever wanted was his swift and safe return.

'However upsetting, this is the beginning of that process. It would be inappropriate to comment further whilst the court has yet to establish Chris’s fate.’

Tappin, from Orpington in Kent, protested his innocence throughout his two-year battle against extradition.

He was due to go on trial next month but on Thursday he is expected to admit charges of conspiring to sell batteries for Iranian missiles at court in El Paso, Texas.

If, as expected, the judge accepts the deal, he will be sentenced within weeks. The agreement could also include an assurance from the US Department of Justice that it will not resist efforts to return him to a prison in the UK.

His lawyer in the UK indicated her client had little choice but to accept a deal.

Karen Todner, who also represented computer hacker Gary McKinnon, said: ‘The odds are so heavily stacked against a defendant who chooses to plead not guilty and then is subsequently found guilty that the vast majority of people facing trial in the US opt to take a plea agreement.’

If found guilty after a trial, he faced 
the prospect of 35 years behind bars in a high-security prison, and no 
prospect of return to the UK to serve his sentence.

Details of the plea deal are secret until revealed to the court, but it 
is thought his term could be as little as four years. His two associates
received terms of 20 and 24 months.

Briton Robert Gibson agreed to co-operate and was jailed for two years 
after pleading guilty to conspiracy to export defence articles.

He also 
provided customs agents with about 16,000 computer files and emails 
indicating that he and Tappin had long-standing commercial ties with 
Iranian customers. Their US contact, Robert Caldwell, served 20 months 
in prison.

Tappin was held in prison for two months following his extradition in February, and then granted $1million (£650,000) bail.

Tappin dealt with a front firm called Mercury Global Enterprise, but 
claimed the batteries, worth around £5,000 each, were going to be used 
in the car industry.

Other Britons who have been  extradited have condemned the US 
plea-bargaining system for allowing prosecutors to act as ‘judge, jury 
and executioner’.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.

Plea bargaining is common in the US, with defendants often able to secure a more lenient sentence if they admit an offence
