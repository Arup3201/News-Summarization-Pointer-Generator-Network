Charlotte Parker, 32, a married teaching assistant, sent thousands of lewd texts to a schoolboy

A married teaching assistant sent thousands of lewd texts after starting a two-year affair with a schoolboy, 14, and threatened suicide when his parents found out.

Charlotte Parker, 32, admitted engaging in sexual activity with the teenage pupil whilst she was working at Hylands Academy in Chelmsford, Essex.

A jury at Basildon Crown Court today heard that the relationship began when the victim was 14 and sent her a Christmas card before spiralling into a two-year love affair.

The victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was between 15 and 16 years of age during the time of offending.

Austin Stoton, prosecuting, told the court the pair had exchanged around 3,000 WhatsApp mobile messages in less than a month between June 17 and July 14, 2013.

He added: 'It seems the victim had explained that he had been seeing the defendant for a period of two years.

'He understood she was married.

'He explained they were close and believed they were going to buy a house together.'

When Parker was told the victim's parents had found out about the affair she sent a message to the boy saying: 'Tonight is going to be the end of my life.

'I'll go quietly - I already have a bath ready.'

An iPhone, iPad and Acer computer were seized from Mrs Parker’s home in Billericay, Essex, in September 2013 on which indecent images of the boy were found.

Parker pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual activity with a child, two counts of making indecent images of a child and one count of encouraging a child to perform a sex act on himself.

She denied two charges of attempting sexual intercourse with a child.

Dale Beeson, mitigating, told the court his client had struggled with mental illness and depression for a decade describing hers as a 'tragic case'. 

Judge John Lodge sentenced her to 12 months in prison, suspended for two years.

Addressing Parker directly, he said: 'Let me make this abundantly clear, this is a case of gross child abuse.

'People who work as teaching assistants, whatever their gender, who take advantage of victims, of any gender, commit very serious offences indeed.

'It makes no difference that the victim was a boy.

'It makes no difference he may have thought he was in a relationship with you.

'The law is there to stop people taking advantage of children.

'It is clear from the all the reports you clearly have psychiatric issues that pre-date the charges.

'It is also clear the victim knew this and was concerned about your welfare.'

Judge Lodge said he was surprised Parker had been allowed to work in a school environment when her mental issues meant she would be 'very much at risk of becoming embroiled in a relationship.'

Parker became tearful as she was told she would be ordered to sign onto the sex offenders register for 10 years and would be banned from working with children.

Hylands Academy is a secondary school and sixth form college on the outskirts of Chelmsford, Essex, which caters for pupils aged 11 to 18 years old and currently has 700 students.

Parker has not worked at the school since the allegations came to light.

A spokesperson from Hylands Academy said: 'The safety of our pupils is our priority and we take safeguarding very seriously.

'This is an isolated incident which has been dealt with according to all correct procedures.

'As soon as the incident came to light, the Academy acted to ensure the ex-member of staff had no contact with pupils and was not allowed on to school premises.

'The police were informed and full cooperation given to ensure full resolution.'
