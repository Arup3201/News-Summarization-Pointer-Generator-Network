The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for same-sex marriage in Alabama despite attempts by the state's chief justice to refuse licenses for gay couples.  

In a federal ruling, the justices rejected Alabama's bid to stop legalization from taking effect on Monday.

It means Alabama is the 37th state to allow gays and lesbians to wed - paving the way for nationwide legalization. 

Ruling: Alabama has become the 37th state to legalize gay marriage after federal justices overruled the state's chief justice Roy Moore who tried to block the legislation. Today, Tori Sisson and Shante Wolfe married

Denied: Chief Justice Roy Moore urged judges to reject licenses for same-sex couples but has been overruled

'It's about time,' said Shante Wolfe, 21, who has camped outside the courthouse with her partner Tori Sisson, hoping to be Alabama's first same-sex couple to marry. 

Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore spearheaded the attempt to block gay marriage in the Deep South state by sending an order to state probate judges on Sunday night.

Moore has been one of the state's most outspoken critics of gay marriage. He called homosexuality an 'inherent evil' in a 2002 custody ruling against a lesbian mother. 

Last week, Moore sent a letter urging probate judges to reject the licenses. 

The head of the judges' association on Friday predicted most would issue the licenses. Moore upped the ante Sunday night by sending the directive.

He argued that judges are not bound by the ruling of a federal judge that the gay marriage ban is unconstitutional.

The letter sent on Sunday night read: 'Effective immediately, no probate judge of the state of Alabama nor any agent or employee of any Alabama probate judge shall issue or recognize a marriage license that is inconsistent with (the Alabama Constitution).' 

After marriages begun on Monday, Alabama's Attorney General Luther Strange slammed the ruling for causing 'confusion'.

According to Pink News, he said: 'In the absence of a stay, there will likely be more confusion in the coming months leading up to the Supreme Court's anticipated ruling on the legality of same-sex marriage.

'With the lifting of the 14-day stay on Feb. 9, 2015, the U.S. District Court order remains in effect, enjoining me from enforcing Alabama's laws against same-sex marriage in my official capacity as attorney general.

'I advise probate judges to talk to their attorneys and associations about how to respond to the ruling.'

It was a dramatic return to defiance for Moore, who was removed as chief justice in 2003 for refusing to obey a federal court order to remove a washing machine-sized Ten Commandments from the state judicial building. 

Critics lashed out that Moore had no authority to tell county probate judges to enforce a law that a federal judge already ruled unconstitutional.

Ecstatic: Tori Sisson and Shante Wolfe said 'it's about time' when they heard the news on Monday morning

He's been one of the state's most outspoken critics of gay marriage; in 2002 he called homosexuality an 'evil' in a custody ruling.

'This is a pathetic, last-ditch attempt at judicial fiat by an Alabama Supreme Court justice-a man who should respect the rule of law rather than advance his personal beliefs,' said Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the Human Rights Campaign.

Warbelow urged probate judges to issue the licenses in compliance with ruling of U.S. District Judge Callie Granade.

Susan Watson, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama, predicted that 'we will see marriage equality in Alabama' on Monday.

'I don't think the probate judges in Alabama are going to defy a federal court judge's order,' she said.

On January 23, Granade ruled that the state's statutory and constitutional bans on gay marriage were unconstitutional but put her order on hold until February 9 to let the state prepare for the change.

Controversial: There remains deep opposition to same-sex marriage in the Deep South state

Justices are expected to issue a ruling later this year on whether gay couples have a right to marry nationwide. 

The same-sex couples queuing outside courthouses were left waiting until the last minute on Monday morning for the high court to issue a ruling on the state's request. 

Jessie and Cooper Odell brought their son with them to witness their marriage. Jessie, 42, said he was surprised by the speed with which Alabama's ban on same-sex marriage fell.

'I knew it was coming, but not this fast with our history on civil rights,' he said.
