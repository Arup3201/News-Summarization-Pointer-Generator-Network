A mother-of-three has lost 9st thanks to the healthy meals cooked for her by her chef husband.

Morgaen Warner, 35, from Brighton lost the weight when her husband Rohan, 33, started cooking healthy versions of kitchen classics for her in the evening.

She was able to drop nine dress sizes and was spurred on by encouragement she received from friends when she posted pictures of the tasty nutritious meals on Facebook.

She said: 'Rohan is a genius in the kitchen - and he can cook anything.

'He cooks delicious meals for me every night. We eat Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Indian and even exotic dishes from Africa and South America.

'He has been so supportive helping me lose weight. He cooks me low-calorie meals with fresh and healthy ingredients helping me to shift the pounds.'Â 

Morgaen struggled with her weight from an early age. But it wasn't until after giving birth to her three children, Daniel, 13, Logan, 10, and Tanya, nine, that she ballooned to 17st.

She said: 'I wasn't confident in myself and I hated it. We would never go out as I was too depressed to go anywhere.

'I had tried every diet under the sun but nothing worked.'

Rohan a trained chef, would cook up delicious meals every night - serving enormous portions of Mexican, Chinese, Indian and Italian food.

Morgaen said: 'Every night after dinner I would then sit in front of the telly scoffing on cakes, chocolate, ice cream and drinking wine.

'I knew my diet wasn't good for my health. I suffered from agonising back and knee pain and just walking to the shop for a pint of milk could leave me feeling like I'd run a marathon.

'I was too self conscious to socialise and I also hid away and made excuses not to see friends.'

Desperate for a change Morgaen went to visit her doctor - who told her she had to overhaul her lifestyle or it could kill her.

Morgaen said: 'Not only was my size causing me excruciating pain - I was putting myself at risk of diabetes and deadly heart disease.

'Tears rolled down my cheeks as she told me I'd have to act immediately or my weight could kill me before I had a chance to see my children grow up.'

The doctor ordered Mrs Warner to change her diet and start exercising.

'On my first trip to the gym I spotted a sign for the local Slimming World and I decided to sign up right away,' said Mrs Warner.

'Armed with advice about healthy eating, I rushed home and begged Rohan to cook healthy alternatives to our favourite meals.

'I worried that I'd miss his delicious dinners but his first offering, a quorn pasta bake, was so scrumptious I was hooked.'

Rohan swapped food cooked in fatty sauces and covered in oil for grilled lean meat served with fresh vegetables.

On a typical day before she started dieting Mrs Warner skipped breakfast and lunch - surviving on just a few cups of coffee throughout the day. She would then gorge herself with a big plate of pie and chips at the end of the day before settling down in front of the television to continue snacking.

Now Morgaen starts the day with fresh fruit and natural yoghurt for breakfast.

For lunch she has a cheese omelette with mushrooms and Quorn sausages and for dinner she will have a chicken curry cooked from scratch with lots of vegetables, lean meat and fresh ingredients for the sauce.

She has also stopped snacking on chocolate, ice cream and cakes in the evening and instead reaches for a piece of fruit if she feels peckish between meals.

Morgaen started posting pictures of the healthy recipes her husband prepared for each night on Facebook.

She said: 'I wanted to show people that delicious food could also be very healthy.

'Pretty soon, friends were posting lots of lovely comments, encouraging me to keep going with my weight loss.

'Every
 time I lost a few pounds, I uploaded a status telling everyone how I 
was doing and their support really spurred me on - especially when I 
found myself reaching for an extra biscuit after dinner.'

Soon the pounds were falling off and three years after she began losing weight, Mrs Warner dropped to a slim eight stone and is now a slinky size eight.

She said: 'My confidence grew and I started taking the kids out to the park, without worrying about strangers staring.

'I've started singing and acting again - something I did as a kid and I never felt like I could do it before.

'Recently I took part in a charity skydive - it was always on my bucket list but my weight stopped me from trying it, they probably wouldn't have even got me off the ground.

'It was the greatest feeling of my life and as soon as I landed I wanted to do it again.

'Thanks to my lovely hubby and my army of Facebook friends, I'm half the woman I used to be - and I couldn't be happier.'
