It should have been the catch of a lifetime – but ended up being the one that got away.

This huge bluefin tuna brought ashore by five university friends  is estimated to be worth close  to £1million.

But strict EU laws designed to protect the critically endangered species – which are highly prized in Japan for raw fish dishes such as sushi and sashimi – mean it is illegal to catch or sell them.

The girls, Hannah Ford, Sarah Little, Shauna Creamer, Charlotte Chambers and Laura Pickervance found the 300lb bluefin tuna floating in waist-deep water near Kingsand in Cornwall while on a beach holiday

The girls managed to load the giant fish onto a kayak to bring it safely home where it was taken by officials 

The giant fish was taken by the Marine Management Organisation who have sent it to University of Exeter where it will undergo a full post mortem including a toxicology examination to determine how it died

In other words Sarah Little, 22, Laura Pickervance and Shauna Creamer, both 23, and Charlotte Chambers and Hannah Ford, both 24, will not make a penny from the extraordinary find they made while holidaying in Cornwall.

The 7ft 1in specimen, which was perfectly edible, has been sitting in a fisherman’s freezer prior to being taken to the University of Exeter today where it will be dissected and studied by experts, rather than served up in a restaurant.

The group, who all met at Oxford Brookes University and reunited for the break in Torquay, remained upbeat about missing out on the windfall yesterday.

Miss Little, who works in PR and lives in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said: ‘We’re not worried that we won’t see the money – you can’t mourn what you never had. It’s certainly made the holiday.’

The friends were heading out for a kayaking session in Kingsand on Saturday when they saw the fish floating in waist-deep water near the beach.

‘We’d only just got in the water and were messing around being silly when we saw this massive thing,’ Miss Little added.

‘I shouted “shark” but then we saw whatever it was was dead and we had a closer look and hauled it up across the kayaks.

'We dragged it ashore and by this time a large crowd had gathered on the beach and saw what we had. We tried to flip it over but it was too heavy, so four men had a go and they couldn’t  lift it either. There was a lot of faffing about.’

The fish was at first believed to be a yellowfin tuna and a local fisherman was allowed to take it away to cut up and use as bait.

But a local strandings officer made some checks and stopped him destroying it after discovering it was the much rarer type.

A 4ft 6in bluefin tuna weighing 300lb valued at £500,000 was confiscated by government officials last year after it was caught off the South Devon coast.

The tuna found in Cornwall was not weighed but may be worth double that sum as it was longer and likely to have had a wider girth. Strandings officer Claire Wallerstein, who works for Cornwall Wildlife Trust, said: ‘It was fascinating just to be able to study such a large and rare creature.

‘They do come in our waters but not often and are usually chasing mackerel. Nobody knows what happened to this one but it may have starved.

‘Somebody in the neighbouring village had reported seeing what they thought was a dolphin trying to beach itself the night before, which now seems possibly to have been this fish.’

Bluefin tuna are rarely seen in the sea around Britain and are more common in the Mediterranean and Atlantic.

A Marine Conservation Society spokesman said: ‘This is a rare event as Atlantic bluefin are only sporadically seen and reported in the English Channel.

‘They are rare because they have been fished heavily in recent decades and the species is close to extinction.’

In January, a 489lb bluefin tuna was sold in auction in Japan for a world-record £1.05 million for a fish

Bluefin tuna migrate from the warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico, following the Gulf Stream to the cold waters between Iceland and Norway. Unusually for fish, bluefin tuna are warm blooded allowing to survive in the cold

The giant tuna weighed 300lbs and was more than two metres long

Bluefin tuna caught in British waters cannot be legally sold due to EU rules

The fish can reach £3,500 per pound at auction in Japan

A single fish can be worth more than £1 million if it is in excellent condition

The Cornish fish will be examined at the University of Exeter tomorrow
