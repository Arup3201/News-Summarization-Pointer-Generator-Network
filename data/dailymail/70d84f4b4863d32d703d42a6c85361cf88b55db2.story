An outraged cyclist has received a cheque for just 23p from court  after a thief who stole his £160 bike was ordered to pay him compensation.

Cyclist Jean-Louis Bourdon was delighted when told police had caught the thief who stole the bike.

But his delight turned to disgust when he received the compensation cheque.

Jean-Louis Bourdon was outraged when the 23p cheque from the courts service arrived almost a year after his bike was stolen.

The design engineer said he had already felt let down when he learned he was to get only £25 paid back by the thief.

He was told the £25 payout was part of £500 compensation magistrates in Derby ordered the crook to pay to 21 victims who had their bikes taken by him.

Almost a year later, a letter arrived from the courts service - but he was astonished to find it contained just the cheque for 23p.

He said: “It is both infuriating and ridiculous and they even spelled my name wrongly on the cheque they sent me.

'I would rather have not received anything at all.

'To me it just goes to show that crime does pay and the legal system doesn’t know what it is doing.

I was mad enough about the £25 offer but they said they couldn’t do anything to help me. But to get this cheque for 100th of what I was going to be getting is completely mystifying.'

Mr Bourdon was outraged when he received just 23p in compensation for his stolen bike.

The 33-year-old returned home to his flat in Derby, in July, last year, to find the bike missing.

He called the police to report the crime and then later was told the thief had been caught and convicted of taking 21 bikes from around Derby.

Mr Bourdon received a letter from HM Courts and Tribunal Service telling him about the £25 he would receive and he wrote a letter of complaint to its tribunal service who wrote back to him.

In their letter it said: 'In your case the defendant was ordered to pay £499.94 to 21 victims of crime.

'The defendant is currently in receipt of benefit and is paying that back at £10 a fortnight.

'The large number of victims and the restriction on repayment periods has greatly reduced the amount of compensation each victim will receive.'

The cheque for just 23p in compensation that was sent to Jean-Louis Bourdon nearly a year after his bike was stolen.

Jean-Louis said he felt “insulted” by the letter.

He said: 'I don’t even know what I am going to do with the cheque now.

'It certainly isn’t worth queuing at the bank to pay it in for.'

He said the court's weak punishment would simply encourage more thefts.

A spokesman for Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal Service said it vigorously pursued offenders who fail to pay victims’ compensation, and that the 23p cheque had been sent to Mr Bourdon by mistake.

'Money can be taken from an offender’s earnings or from benefits if they are unemployed.

'Warrants can be issued instructing court employed agents to seize and sell goods belonging to the offender.

'It is an independent judicial decision as to the size of monthly repayments of compensation to victims and fines - this is based on the ability of the defendant to pay.'

'If the defendant owes compensation to more than one victim the court will allocate the payments among those witnesses,' said the spokesman.

'It is normal practice for smaller cheques not to be sent to victims until the repayment has reached £5.

'In this case the 23p cheque was issued in error for which we apologise.'

'The spokesman could not say when Jean-Louis would get his first cheque for £5 or when he might be expected to finally receive the total amount of compensation awarded.'
