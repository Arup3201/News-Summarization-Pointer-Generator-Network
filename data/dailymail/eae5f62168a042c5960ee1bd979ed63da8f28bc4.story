The frontman of a Grammy-nominated Christian metal band who plotted to have his wife killed admitted he's an atheist but lied about his faith to sell records.

Timothy Lambesis, lead singer and founder of the band As I Lay Dying, was sentenced to six years prison last month for trying to hire a hitman to murder his estranged wife Meggan Lambesis.

The 33-year-old's conviction shocked his devoted fans, some of whom prayed with the singer after concerts believing he was a devout Christian.

However in an exclusive interview with Alternative Press, the Californian confessed he described himself to fans as 'not a Satanist' in order to avoid saying he was an atheist.

In the interview, Lambesis talked about a YouTube video he made in which he addressed fans who believed his new side project, 'Pyrithion', was satanic.

'As far as the [YouTube] video I did explaining 'Pyrithion''s lyrics… I was trying to put out a fire. I was afraid it would affect As I Lay Dying sales, which would affect my overall income. I was trying to put out the fire by saying the easiest thing, 'I'm not a satanist!'" he explained.

'Truthfully, I was an atheist. The 'strategy' I had at the time was cowardly. Two of the songs on that record were about coming to grips with the idea that life has no purpose, no meaning.

'These were negative themes I wasn't 'allowed' to deal with in As I Lay Dying songs. I thought making As I Lay Dying darker would be bad for my career. That was my thinking.'

He said some of his band members, and many other Christian bands, shared his views. He said the charade became awkward.

'When kids would want to pray with us after shows, I'd be like, 'Um, go ahead and pray!' I would just let them pray. I'd say 'Amen.' If praying while I have my hand on their shoulder makes them feel better, I didn't want to take that away from them,' he confessed.

'When they would specifically ask me to pray for something, I'd say, 'I don't really like to pray out loud, but I'll take that with me to the bus'.'

Father: Lambesis complained his estranged wife wouldn't let him see the three children they adopted from Ethiopia, now aged four, eight and 10

He was arrested in May last year after giving an 
undercover agent acting as a hitman, money, gate codes and an alibi to 
kill his estranged wife, Meggan Lambesis, NBC San Diego reported.

He said he wanted his wife dead because she was 
going to get up to 60 percent of his income and would not allow their 
three young children to join him on tour.

According to court documents, Meggan Lambesis filed for divorce in September 2012 to end the couple’s eight-year marriage.

In
 divorce records obtained by the Associated Press, Meggan Lambesis 
claimed the rocker had become 'obsessed with bodybuilding' and was 
distracted with the children, even falling asleep once while watching 
them.

Last year, as their relationship further soured, Lambesis told a personal trainer at his gym, Brett Kimball, that he wanted to get rid of his wife.

'He wanted to know if maybe I could find someone to do it for him,' Kimball testified at a pretrial hearing.

Police began an investigation in April following a tip-off.

Lambesis was recorded telling an undercover agent that he wanted his wife killed, according to prosecutors.

The
 undercover agent, San Diego County Sheriff's Officer Howard Bradley, 
testified last year that Lambesis met him at an Oceanside bookstore in 
May and said he wanted his wife 'gone'.

Bradley said he asked Lambesis directly if he wanted his wife killed, and the singer replied, 'Yes, I do'.

The heavily-tattooed gym junkie said his wife had restricted his visits with their children aged four, eight and 10, 
adopted from Ethiopia, after they separated in September 2012.

The
 singer also told the agent that he was angry that Meggan Lambesis would
 get a large share of his income in a divorce settlement.

Bradley said Lambesis told him at the end of their meeting, 'Just to clarify, just so you know, I do want her dead.'

Lambesis
 provided the undercover agent with an envelope containing $1,000 cash 
for expenses, his wife’s address and gate codes, pictures of her and 
specific dates when he would have the children and therefore, an alibi.

Atheist: Musician Tim Lambesis admitted he faked his Christian beliefs so he could sell records

Tried to hire a hit man: Timothy Lambesis, co-founder of Christian heavy metal band As I Lay Dying, pleaded guilty to hiring someone to kill his estranged wife

As
 I Lay Dying formed in San Diego in 2000 and has released eight albums, 
including 2007's An Ocean Between Us, which reached No. 8 on 
Billboard's charts.

A single from the album, Nothing Left, was 
nominated for a Grammy for top metal performance.

The
 band plays in an aggressive style that features lightning-speed metal 
guitar riffs. The group's philosophical lyrics attracted a 
following of Christian rock fans.

Lambesis in the past openly declared he was Christian.

He allegedly stated during an August 2010 radio interview on The Full Armor of God Broadcast that his writing was inspired by his Christian faith.

'I can only really write about what I'm passionate about in life, so naturally my faith, my belief in the teachings of Jesus and His resurrection come across in our lyrics,' he said.
