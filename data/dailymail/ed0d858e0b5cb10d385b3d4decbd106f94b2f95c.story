An 11-year-old boy was shot dead with a revolver while playing at his best friend's house in Ohio on Tuesday afternoon.

Police believe Lucas Templin was shot accidentally by his friend, also aged 11, after the boys found a loaded gun at the Frazeysburg home.

The schoolboy, who had been best man at his father's wedding last weekend, died at the scene from a single gunshot to the chest.

Tragic accident: Bikes belonging to Lucas and his friend lean against the house where the 11-year-old was shot

The mother of the boy believed to have shot Lucas was outside mowing the lawn at the time and didn't hear the gunshot, or the ambulance arrive.

Her neighbor, Rose McNemar, said she tried to comfort the mother and son, who have not been named, immediately after the accident.

'[She] was a mess. I tried to comfort the little boy. He was shaking and 
bawling. He had blood on him. He kept saying, "Is he OK? He’s going to 
be OK, Mom?",' Ms McNemar told the Columbus Dispatch.

The boys had been alone in the house for less than 10 minutes when the gun went off.

Neighbors described hearing Lucas's mother screaming as she ran towards the house after hearing of the shooting.

Lucas's grandmother, Cindy Swartz, 
described the boys as 'best friends' and said her grandson had only just
 celebrated his 11th birthday.

The bike he had asked for as a present was still leaning on the porch of his friend's house the day after the shooting.

'He was a typical 11-year-old boy, riding his bike all over town,' she told Fox 28, adding that he regularly cycled to his friend's home.

Police are investigating the shooting, which is believed to have been an accident. The name of the gun owner, and where the boys found it, has not been released.  

No charges have been made yet.
