A Navy diver died at the bottom of a Maryland pond last year after refusing to leave his trapped fellow sailor to drown alone.

Petty Officer 2nd Class Ryan Harris, 23, and Petty Officer 1st Class James Reyher, 28, were sent to dive in the Aberdeen Proving Ground on February 26 2013, but their lifeless bodies were pulled to the surface just 31 minutes after they started the dive.

No one knew what had befallen the pair until an investigation, completed last year but only recently released, pieced together the final 31 minutes of the young men's lives.

Hero: An investigation found that Navy Petty Officer 2nd Class Ryan Harris could have saved his own life, but exhausted his oxygen trying to free his fellow sailor trapped under water

A series of difficulties: The odds were stacked against Petty Officer 1st Class James Reyher on the day he and Harris embarked on a training exercise that would claim both their lives

The investigation, conducted more than 16 months ago, was finally released last week to The Virginian-Pilot under the Freedom of Information Act.

It appears the dive, a pre-deployment training exercise, was doomed from the beginning.

It was not a single act, but a series of failures that contributed to the training accident.

According to the Pilot, the men were supposed to locate a sunken helicopter 150 feet underwater using a breathing apparatus called a Mark 16, but some of the equipment wasn't working.

A barge that would have supplied limitless surface air and audio communication while to the men while submerged was blocked by a barrier set up for another training exercise.

The leaders of the expedition were reluctant to call their commanding officer to seek permission to change the day's training plan, so they decided to have Harris and Reyher use scuba gear and estimated that a single canister of air would be enough for the two to complete the task.

The investigation, which called the leaders' actions 'multiple points of failure and decision making' found that the limited air did not allow for the divers to deal with any unforeseen difficulties.

Harris and Reher were among their unit's most experienced divers, but the men faced a series of difficulties with their equipment, communication with the surface was patchy and finally, Debris beneath the murky water trapped Reyher 150 feet underwater.

Harris and Reyher were connected to each other and the boat. Harris could have cut the cord connecting him to Reyher and swim free, but he didn't.

Training day: The two men died during a training day at Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland

'Harris exhausted himself in an attempt to save Reyher,' the investigator concluded.

'Both divers resisted the natural instincts of self-preservation, in order to expel his last breaths in an effort to save each other.'

Harris will posthumously receive the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for his actions.

The award is typically given to members of the Navy and Marine Corps who demonstate heroism during non-combat situations.

Harris was married to his high school sweetheart, Deanna Favoroso Harris, and the pair had two young daughters.

Reyher was also married, to Diana Kafury Reyher, whom he 'loved to spoil and aggravate,' according to his obituary.

The deaths resulted in at least five members of personnel being disciplined. Four were charged with dereliction of duty, and the commanding officer who was unreachable was fired for being 'unapproachable and disengaged.'
