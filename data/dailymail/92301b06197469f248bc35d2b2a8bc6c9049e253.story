The Norwich players liked Chris Hughton, but knew results weren't good enough. There was a feeling
 among some members of the squad that a change was needed.

But when it came, they didn't expect Neil Adams, a man who had no senior football management experience, to be Hughton's replacement.

Needless to say, the change hasn't worked and Norwich now face a summer of transition. Seb Bassong, Leroy Fer and Gary Hooper are among those who want to leave this summer.

Gone! Chris Hughton was sacked by Norwich late in the season when they already looked in trouble

There will be more who will look to leave; England keeper John Ruddy one of those whose future is now shrouded in uncertainty.

Let's go back to Hughton's sacking on April 6.

It's funny how words can come back to bite you on the backside. Here's an example.

'We will stay up - but we've made this change with that in mind,' said Norwich chief executive David McNally in explaining his decision to sack Hughton and replace him with rookie boss Adams.

Oh dear.

Only a miracle can save the Canaries from returning to the Championship now.

They have to beat Arsenal on Sunday, hope Stoke defeat West Brom at the Hawthorns  - and then hope for a 17 goal swing.

For all intents and purposes, Norwich are relegated. But who is to blame? Hughton can take a share, as should the players. But McNally's contribution shouldn't be under estimated.

And the players know it, too.

Certain members of the Canaries squad have been left bewildered at the utter indecision from McNally over the past 12 months and believe he has contributed significantly to their downfall.

The first real doubts over Hughton's reign emerged towards the end of last season.

Despite leading Norwich to an excellent 11th place in their second season back in the top-flight, the Canaries board were not happy.

A lack of goals and what was perceived as a negative style of play were causes for concern despite their healthy league position.

McNally even canvassed opinion from the playing squad about Hughton's reign last April - with the majority of them providing a healthy reference of their manager.

Nevertheless, since then Hughton had been fire fighting; keeping the wolves from his door at a game at a time.

The club were privately planning for life without Hughton. Norwich legend Malky Mackay - who was manager at Cardiff at the time - was a favourite among the Canaries hierarchy.

If there had been a realistic chance of luring him away from Wales, then McNally would have jumped at it.

It was hoped the signings of attacking talent such as Ricky van Wolfswinkel, Nathan Redmond and Hooper would help Hughton build a more expansive and attacking team.

But their fears over negative tactics re-surfaced again following a disappointing start to the season that saw them score just six goals in their opening nine Premier League games.

McNally was ready to pull the trigger, but a 3-1 win over West Ham in November saved Hughton.Another dreadful run of one win and just five goals in 11 matches put Hughton's job on the line once again in February.

But this time the club's doubts over Hughton were laid bare for all to see following McNally's now infamous BBC interview where he admitted a plan was already in place should the club decide to sack their manager.

Another win, this time over Tottenham yet again saved Hughton's job - but just one win in the next six games was enough for McNally, as he finally wielded the axe.

But the question is: why did it take a year for the club to bite the bullet and sack the former Newcastle boss?

The board were obviously unconvinced, as were supporters who gradually started to turn on Hughton.

In confirming Hughton's sacking in in April, McNally said: 'If we go down will I resign? That would be a matter for me to discuss with the board. I'm aware of my responsibilities.'

Indeed, you are partly responsible for taking Norwich down.
