The force was very much with a young Star Wars fan during the summer when he received a surprise visit from an iconic visitor while recovering in hospital.

Last July Mike Elliott's young son was being treated in hospital for meningitis and he had a fever of 40 degrees celsius.

The boy was very weak and during his time in hospital and numerous tests were carried out on him in order to learn more about his illness. 

A hospital employee heard that the boy was a big Star Wars fan and he brought his replica of the R2D2 robot, which featured in the films, into the hospital to give the boy a positive lift.

The boy is seen resting on his bed with his mother when a voice can be overheard saying, 'I have a present for you.'

Moments later Mr Elliott says, 'What is that?' as the young boy smiles broadly and the R2D2 robot makes its grand entrance into his hospital room.

The robot enters and makes a number of beeping noises and even plays the song Stayin' Alive by the Bee Gees.

Moments later the young boy laughs with his mother on his bed as the R2D2 robot plays popular Sesame Street song Mahna Mahna.

At the end of the heartwarming three minute 48 second video the young boy gets a photo taken with the chirpy robot.
