When retired mathematician Allan Robinson passed away after a battle with cancer, his grieving family chose an epitaph that he would have heartily approved of – a sudoku puzzle and equation.

It did not take long, however, before zealous officials on the parish council had formed their own rather bizarre opinion of the gravestone.

They ordered Mr Robinson’s widow Angela to remove the highly personal engravings because they are ‘contrary to guidelines for headstone inscriptions’.

Widow Angela Robinson is furious that Farndon Parish Council, Cheshire, has ordered that the Sudoku puzzle engraving on her husband Allan's headstone be removed

And despite the tasteful – not to 
mention cerebral – nature of the designs, the council said the stone has
 to be changed so that standards at the graveyard are ‘kept high for the
 benefit of all’.

Mrs 
Robinson, 67, who was married to her late husband for 44 years, said: 
‘What really got to me was they said we were lowering standards of the 
burial site. Well, that’s just not true.

‘The
 engravings aren’t offensive at all; we’re talking about a three inch 
square puzzle and a small numerical equation. It’s about honouring my 
husband’s memory.’

Mr 
Robinson was a sudoku fanatic, completing puzzles every day,  while the 
equation was taken  from his PhD thesis, which he  dedicated to his wife
 in the early years of their marriage.

Mrs
 Robinson’s son, Paul, 40, added: ‘It is a very personal memorial that 
surely is not causing any harm, regardless of petty rules. Jobsworth 
springs to my mind.’

Allan Robison's family, including son Paul and wife Angela, pictured together, have been ordered to remove Sudoku engraving commemorating the 66-year-old, pictured right, who died last year

Mr 
Robinson, who worked for oil giant Shell in a research laboratory, died 
aged 66 in May last year, following a battle with lung cancer.

He
 was buried in the cemetery at Farndon, near 
Chester, where the couple lived, and the gravestone was put up in 
November. But this August Mrs Robinson received a call from the parish 
council to say a spot check of graves had revealed her husband’s 
tombstone did not comply with their guidelines.

Then last month she was sent the letter ordering her to remove the engravings altogether.

Suzi
 Pollard, clerk to the parish council, said the stonemason had failed to
 submit a draft copy of the proposed headstone inscription to the 
council before it was erected, and asked for it to be changed.

To add 
insult to injury, the letter wrongly referred to Mr Robinson as ‘Mr 
Allen’.

Mrs Robinson, who 
has two children and four grandchildren, said there are other graves 
with unusual engravings, such as animals and football crests. ‘Until the
 others are removed as well I’m going to refuse to change Allan’s 
grave,’ she said.

Mr Robinson added that his family would be prepared to go to court to keep the existing headstone.
