Yannick Bolasie put in a stunning display as the Democratic Republic of Congo began their Africa Cup of Nations campaign with a hard-fought draw against a resilient Zambia.

The Crystal Palace winger, who has been in superb form in the Premier League this season, was the creative force in a team set-up to attack, and was rewarded with a second-half goal, which cancelled out Given Singluama’s early strike.

On the first match-day outside of the country’s two major cities, and without the hosts playing any part, there was some concern that Ebebiyin’s stadium might be empty for the Group B clashes.

Congo DR (4-2-4): Kidiaba; Mpeko, Kimwaki, Mongongu, Kasusula; Mbemba, Mulumbu ©; Mubele (Mabwati63), Kage (Kabananga 64), MBokani, Bolasie. 

Goal:  Bolasie 66

Those doubts proved to be unfounded, however, as locals and travelling supporters alike packed out the small ground in the jungle city, overfilling the stands to such an extent that some fans were moved into the press box to find them seats.

It took Zambia, the Cup of Nations winners in 2012, just 62 seconds to take the lead, when Robert Kidiaba in the Congo goal made a hash of punching away a cross from the left hand side, and Singuluma curled in from the edge of the box.

The men in green were always likely to sit back and play to their strengths on the counter-attack, where Southampton’s Emmanuel Mayuka was a constant threat, and the early goal allowed them to adopt their favoured gameplan and frustrate the Congolese side.

Bolasie was the biggest threat in a DR Congo side that lined up with an all-out front four, but he was hindered by a Chipolopolo defence that conceded just twice during qualification, and a pitch that cut up at an alarming rate.

The Palace winger was still able to create an early chance for striker Herve Kage, but the centre forward couldn’t get the ball out of his feet.

The Leopards kept attacking throughout the first half, and were almost handed a goal by Zambia keeper Kennedy Mweene, who spilled a cross straight to Dieudonne Mbokani, only for the striker to blaze over from 6 yards.

Mweene more than made up for his early error though, saving well from both a Bolasie drive and an Mbokani header.

The one time the Zambian keeper was beaten in the first period, by a deflected Bolasie free kick, the ball squirmed inches wide of the post.

As the game wore on the men in white seemed to be running out of ideas, the Zambian defence living up to their mean-spiritied reputation.

But, when a slip by Zambia left back Chisamba Lungu gifted possession to Mabwati, the Chipolopolo were exposed. He picked out Bolasie on the edge of the box, and the winger curled it beautifully into the top corner.

Suddenly the chances started to flow, substitute Junior Kabananga threatening with a couple of strikes from the edge of the box, before a spectacular Mbokani bicycle kick was saved by Mweene.

But neither side could fashion a winner, and were forced to share the points ahead of games against Cape Verde and Tunisia.
