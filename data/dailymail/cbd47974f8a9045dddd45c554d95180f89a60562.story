Andreea Baliban was standing behind her mother Rebecca's car at their Holley Place home in Marangaroo, north of Perth, on Friday when she was fatally struck

The distraught parents of a two-year-old girl who was killed when her mother accidentally reversed over her in a Perth driveway have described their daughter as a 'little princess'.

Andreea Baliban was standing behind her mother Rebecca's car at their Holley Place home in Marangaroo, north of Perth, on Friday when she was fatally struck.

'Our hearts are shattered and words cannot express what we are going through,' Andreea’s father Lucian, told Nine News.

'It’ll never be the same again. We wait for the day when we will see our little princess again in heaven.'

The toddler suffered critical head injuries when she was hit by her 31-year-old mother's Peugeot wagon shortly after 10am.

A neighbour frantically tried to revive Andreea before paramedics arrived and rushed her to Joondalup Health Campus. She died soon after she arrived. 

Mrs Baliban and Andreea's two older sisters, Ruth, 7, and Lois, 5, were inside the car when the incident unfolded.

Andreea was the youngest of three girls and was set to celebrate her third birthday in August.

There was an outpouring of grief on Saturday as neighbours, friends and strangers laid flowers outside the family's home.

'We thank everyone whose hearts and thought are with us in this difficult time,' Mr Baliban said. 

It is understood the Baliban's were part of a tight-knit Romanian community and regularly attended the Romanian Pentecostal Church in Balga.

Allan Mawdesley from Perth's Major Crash Investigation Unit said Andreea's death appeared to be a 'horrible accident'.

He said he understood the young child was obscured from the mother's view but had no idea why she wasn't already in the car with her siblings.

'It appears, somehow, the young child looks like she has gotten behind the car and she has been reversed into,' Mr Mawdesley said.

'We got the call about 10.15 am, initially from the St John's Ambulance about the fact the child had been reversed over... it would appear that it was a horrible accident.'
