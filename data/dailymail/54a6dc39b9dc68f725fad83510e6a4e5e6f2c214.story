Michaela Hutchings, 23, was caught using £52,000 of council money to go on a shopping spree, and was ordered to repay the cash. But she is complaining the courts targeted her because she is attractive

A single-mother facing jail after being ordered to repay £52,000 in council money she used to go on a designer shopping spree says she is being treated unfairly because of her looks.

Michaela Hutchings, 23, used £51,821.34 accidentally transferred into her account by Lichfield Council to buy expensive designer shoes, handbags and sunglasses in a spending splurge last year.

After she was caught, a judge spared her jail on the condition she paid the money back by Christmas Eve, but now she is complaining that the punishment is unfair, and that she has been made an example of because she is attractive.

In an interview with The Sun, she said: 'I've done wrong but I'm only human, the same as everyone else. They're punishing me because of the way I look.

'If I wasn't much to look at and played the card of "Oh, I only get this much a month, I was in a bit of a sticky situation" I reckon I'd have got a slap on the wrist and just paid back a fiver a week.

'I pleaded guilty but the only person guilty is the person who put the money in my account. I don't think I should have been punished the way I was. It's just outrageous.'

Bungling Lichfield District Council, Staffs, transferred the money into Hutchings account by mistake in April last year instead of paying Bromford Housing Association.

Hutchings
 said she only discovered the money while withdrawing cash on a trip to 
buy milk, and when she quizzed her bank over the sum, they couldn't tell
 her where it had come from.

She 
maintains that she wouldn't have touched the money had it not been for 
her ex-boyfriend, who she says took her to Birmingham's Bull Ring 
Shopping Centre to spend the cash.

The
 pair went to Selfridges where, according to Hutchings, her boyfriend 
bought thousands of pounds worth of designer clothes, shoes, belts and 
sunglasses.

She
 claims that she initially spent nothing, but on the second day treated 
herself to a Gucci bag, a Louis Vuitton bag and belt and Dior 
sunglasses.

The glamorous single-mother found £51,821.34 in her account last year while going to buy a pint of milk that was accidentally transferred to her by Lichfield Council

Rather than return the money, she went on a two-day spending spree with her former boyfriend - splurging £9,000 in just 48 hours

In just 48 hours, she hand spent £8,000 on shopping, and used a further £1,000 to pay off an outstanding train fine that had built up.

She also gave her mother £1,000, and had put a further £40,000 into savings on the advice of her bank, who were unaware of the council's mistake.

Meanwhile officials at Lichfield Council had realised their error, stopped a further £44,500 being transferred, and were desperately trying to trace her to explain the error.

Hutchings says she was out when two men from the council eventually arrived at her mother's house, but the next day they came back with riot police who surrounded the area.

She says officers with their Tasers drawn handcuffed her, threw her into the back of a riot van, and took her to a police station where she was charged with dishonestly retaining a wrongful credit, which carries up to ten years behind bars.

Hutchings was spared jail on the condition that she repay the council their money, with interest. But she now says the sentence was unfair, and claims she may appeal

She called the repayments 'outrageous' saying that, if anyone should be punished for what happened, it should be the council worker who transferred the cash

She pleaded guilty and was taken to Stafford Crown Court for sentencing, where Recorder Derek Desmond spared her prison provided she could repay £52, 465.21 - the initial sum, plus £643.87 interest.

Hutchings says she immediately repaid the £40,000 she had saved, plus £3,600 left in her bank account.

The council will auction off the items she bought, and then it is up to her to repay the rest.

She told The Sun she is putting aside £20 a week from working in her parents' stables, but is considering appealing the terms of her 'unfair' repayments.

She added: 'It's a bit outrageous, isn't it? My life has been turned upside down by all this. The person at Lichfield Council who did it shouldn't have a job.

'They have ruined a part of my life with the stress and abuse I've been through.'
