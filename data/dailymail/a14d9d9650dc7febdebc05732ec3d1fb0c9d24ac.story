Jessica Harper has been accused of embezzling the banking giant out of almost £2.5million

A former head of fraud and security at Lloyds has been charged with stealing almost £2.5million from the bank.

Jessica Harper, 50, is accused of pocketing £2,463,750 by submitting false business invoices to claim payments.

The senior manager at the Lloyds Banking Group, which is 40 per cent owned by taxpayers, was in charge of security at its digital section when the alleged scam took place.

Harper, who earned around £70,000, is said to have submitted claims relating to the bank’s business, rather than to her personal expenses, during the height of the credit crunch and shortly after the bank was bailed out by the Government.

But the alleged fraud between 2008 and 2011 was not uncovered until the bank carried out an internal investigation last year.

She was arrested by detectives from Scotland Yard’s economic and specialist crime unit in December after the bank passed on its findings to police.

Yesterday friends told of their shock after the Crown Prosecution Service decided to charge her with a single count of fraud.

Neighbours at her £450,000 semi-detached Edwardian home, which is situated in a leafy suburb in Croydon, South London, described her a keen charity worker and Rotarian.

The divorcee, who separated from her husband John, 50, a number of years ago, has lived with her brother Gareth Tyrrell for years in the four bedroom property, although she also has a second property in France where her mother Helen lives.

One of her other brothers, Matthew Tyrrell, runs a networking company working with stars in the music industry such as Bob Geldof, Paul Weller, Jim Kerr, Ed Sheeran and Rihanna.

One of Harper’s neighbours, who did not want to be named, said: ‘She’s a nice person to have next door to you. She’s lovely.

‘She used to do loads of charity work and she was a member of the local Rotary club. I’d be shocked if she has done something like this as she’s just not that type of person.’

Another neighbour said Harper used to throw two parties a year and invite the whole street.

He said: ‘She used to have a BBQ in the summer and a party at Christmas. But she isn’t a flashy person. I’d say she is very basic in her dress and she didn’t look like she really wore make-up.’

The house has recently been put up for sale.

Harper has worked at Lloyds since 2000 but left several months ago. Sources described her as a middle manager who had only taken on the security and fraud position as an interim role. She had no access to customer accounts. On business networking site Linkedin, Harper said she was responsible for online technology development, delivery, text and email, security, fraud and internet operations.

A former colleague posted a recommendation in 2007 saying: ‘Jessica is surely one of the most connected persons in the bank.’

Yesterday Andrew Penhale, of the Crown Prosecution Service central fraud group, confirmed the charge. Harper will appear before Westminster magistrates on Thursday.
