A bride-to-be born with no arms has learned to scuba dive so she can swim amongst the coral with her husband on honeymoon in the Maldives.

Laura Britland, 32, was determined to dive with Jon Furness, who she marries next month, despite her disability.

She was warned that you need arms for propulsion and hands to control the tanks, valves and mask underwater - but scuba experts developed a new technique allowing her to overcome this.

Ms Britland uses her feet to tackle everyday tasks at home - but underwater the diving flippers get in the way.

So the scuba experts rigged up a series of strings and lines so she can operate valves and flotation tubes with her knees.

She said: 'I was looking for something to do as a challenge and I was spurred on when somebody said I couldn’t do it. It wasn’t easy at first but like everything else if you are determined you’ll succeed.

'If I felt myself getting knocked back I would think about how much I want to dive in the Maldives on honeymoon with Jon.'

Technique: Mr Lowe adjusts her breathing apparatus in the pool. Ms Britland uses a special technique which enables her to propel herself through the water, despite her disabilities

Practice: She goes through her paces in the pool. Ms Britland said the attraction of diving was that it is 'peaceful and calm'

Ms Britland learned to swim when she was a little girl but only on her back because you need arms to keep your head out of the water.

But she said her greatest fear was making the 'giant stride' - the term divers use to describe the moment they step over the edge of a pool or boat into the water.

She said: 'Since I was a child I’ve been taught not to fall, as I’d end up flat on my face because I can’t put out a hand to stop me. So stepping forward into the water felt alien to me, but now I’ve got used to making that giant stride.

'The other problem was the diving mask, you need a hand to take it off and clear it from water or misting. I had to concentrate on remaining calm when my mask was full of water instead of panicking, as that made it more difficult to clear.'

Ms Britland said she developed a technique of looking up and putting her tongue on the roof of her mouth then breathing through her nose to clear the mask.

The charity worker, of Rugby, Warwickshire, has completed her diving qualifications with the British Sub-Aqua Club.

She is now planning her first open water dive at the Stoney Cove National Diving Centre, a former quarry, near Leicester. Ms Britland, and  civil servant Mr Furness, 33, are getting married in Sheffield next month and will honeymoon in the Maldives later this year.

She was born without arms due to a genetic condition but said her parents refused to treat her any differently to any other child.

She said: 'I was born without arms - there’s never been an explanation why, but it seems to be genetic. I’ve never been interested in finding out the reason.

'My parents’ attitude has always been just to get on with it, they never let me say I couldn’t do anything - I couldn’t get out of helping around the house. I use my feet a lot, where other people would use their hands.'

She said the attraction of diving for her 'is that it is peaceful and calm, and, when I dive, I feel the same as other people.'

Love: The couple are now looking forward to looking at the coral and tropical fish on their honeymoon

Ms Britland is about to take delivery of a custom-made £950 armless dry-suit with buoyancy valves built-in so she can use her chin or knees to adjust them. The zip has also been adapted so she can fasten it herself.

Mr Furness, who is also learning to dive, said: 'I’m really proud of her - if you tell Laura she can’t do something she will prove them wrong. I can’t wait to dive together in the Maldives and hopefully have our photograph taken together underwater.'

The pair praised diving instructors Marcus Bancroft and Dave Lowe who rigged up the elaborate system that allows Ms Britland to operate her scuba equipment with her knees.

Mr Bancroft, 42, said: 'Laura is a brave and inspiring young woman - by the time her honeymoon comes around she will be a competent diver.'
