His foul-mouthed rants provoked the wrath of parents and now it appears have cost him listeners too.

But Nick Grimshaw’s loss is a gain for Chris Evans.

The latest set of radio audience figures have revealed a drop in listeners for the up-and-coming DJ who replaced Chris Moyles in the morning on Radio 1.

While figures have revealed a drop in listeners to Nick Grimshaw, right, the breakfast show hosted by Chris Evans, left, at the same time on Radio 2 has seen a boost

In contrast the breakfast show hosted by Mr Evans at the same time on Radio 2 has seen a boost in figures.

And it appears older men turned off by Grimshaw’s immature banter prefer tuning in to Evans. 

Grimshaw got 6.7million weekly listeners in the quarter up to the end of this month, compared with Evans’s figures of 9.5million.

Grimshaw’s show was also beaten by Radio 4’s flagship news service the Today programme, which got an audience of more than seven million.

Sources at the BBC suggested they were relieved by Grimshaw’s figures as many had expected a much more dramatic drop, given the following Moyles had acquired fronting the breakfast show.

The corporation is desperate to lower the average age of listeners to Radio 1 and is prepared to take a hit on listening figures if it can get more youthful audience.

Grimshaw’s figures were down by 43,000 on the previous three-month period, which was mostly fronted by Moyles, and dropped by almost 550,000 on the same time last year.

In contrast the audience for Evans’s breakfast show shot up by a million listeners on the previous three-months. His audience of 9.52million was close to the 9.53million record he pulled in during his first three months in the job in 2010.

Insiders believe many of the older males who quit Radio 1 after Moyles left having been on the station for eight years, have now switched over to Radio 2.

Sources at the BBC claimed that Grimshaw had attracted 250,000 brand new 15-24-year-olds to the show. It was added that the overall average of the listener to the station has dropped from 33 to 32-years-of-age.

This is the first set of figures which apply solely to the new Radio 1 breakfast show host. The previous quarter’s results included about a month’s worth of Grimshaw’s show.

Grimshaw took over from Moyles as the breakfast host in September and has had a rocky transition. He has been pictured out boozing with celebrity friends such as One Direction star Harry Styles and socialiste Pixie Geldof just hours before the early morning radio show.

In November he caused uproar with a series of foul-mouthed comments on his Twitter account.

Parents set up an online petition claiming he is a poor role model for younger fans.

The foul-mouthed rants sparked criticism that his behaviour was inappropriate for someone in his position.

Moyles departed from the BBC Radio 1 breakfast show with his lowest audience for six years last year.

Ben Cooper, Controller of Radio 1 said: ‘ What a fantastic quarter for Radio 1, I’m delighted with the figures and they have exceeded my expectation for a brand new breakfast show. This has been the biggest schedule change in a generation which has resulted in the station’s audience getting younger.’

Radio 2 and 6 Music controller Bob Shennan said Evans’s show was ‘the lynchpin of the Radio 2 schedule’ and was ‘in great shape’.

The Rajar results as they are known also showed that overall radio listening was up.

An average of over 47million listeners are now tuning in, compared with 46.7million at the same time last year.

Figures also showed just over 42 per cent of adults now say they own a DAB radio set, compared with 40 per cent last year.

Once-doomed Radio 6 Music saw its audience rise by almost half a million listeners since the same period last year.

The digital channel, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last year, was saved from the axe two years ago after furious listeners protested against the BBC’s decision.
