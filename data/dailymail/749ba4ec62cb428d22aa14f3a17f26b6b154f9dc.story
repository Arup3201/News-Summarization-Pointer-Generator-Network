The aunt of self-styled 'psycho' murderer Kiaran Stapleton has won £1m on the lottery.

Mandy Burgess, 42, is believed to have gone on a luxury holiday after she was one of 100 people to scoop the jackpot in a special EuroMillions Olympic draw.

Her numbers came up only a day after her nephew Stapleton was jailed for life for shooting an Indian student dead at point-blank range and standing over his body laughing.

Millionaire: Mandy Burgess, the aunt of murderer Kiaran Stapleton, is a EuroMillions jackpot winner

Ms Burgess, a mother of three who married into a notorious Manchester crime family, won the jackpot in a EuroMillions Raffle to celebrate the start of the London Olympics.

'Mandy can't believe her luck,' a source told the Sun. 'She's on holiday - celebrating big time.'

Stapleton, 21, who is the son of Ms Burgess's sister Billie Jean, has been told he must serve at least 30 years in prison for the murder of Anuj Bidve, 23, on Boxing Day last year.

He walked up to Mr Bidve, whom he had never met before, in the street in Salford, Greater Manchester, and shot him in the head at point-blank range.

He admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but was convicted of murder by a jury at Manchester Crown Court.

The killer, who even sniggered as he was sentenced by a judge, became notorious after he gave his name as 'Psycho Stapleton' during his first court appearance in the case.

Ms Burgess was married to Damian 
Noonan, a major figure in Manchester's criminal underworld before his 
death in a motorcycle crash in 2003 at the age of 37.

Noonan's brother Domenyk has featured in a documentary made by investigative journalist Donal MacIntyre about organised crime.

Another brother, Dessie Noonan, who 
was stabbed to death in 2005, was the uncle of Mark Duggan, 29, whose 
shooting during a police incident in Tottenham, north London, sparked 
the summer riots of 2011.

The family has also been profiled in a television series called At Home With The Noonans.

Lucky: Mandy Burgess is understood to have celebrated her jackpot win by taking a luxury holiday

Ms Burgess's son Damien Noonan, 25, was jailed for six years and nine months in May after he plotted to flood the streets with a banned dance drug and arranged the brutal abduction and torture of a man.

Preston Crown Court heard that Noonan and and two other masked thugs had abducted 29-year old Steve Barton in the street in Chorley, Lancashire, in October last year as children played nearby.

They then bundled him into a Nissan Qashqai car and bound him with tape.

Witnesses said the men punched, kicked and stamped on their target and given a 'severe beating' until he passed out before dragging him into the car.

During the victim’s hour long ordeal,
the gangsters threatened to shoot him in the knees and burn his fingers
off with a blowtorch.

But
when armed police stopped the kidnappers’ vehicle in a pub car park in 
Whitefield, Manchester and drew their guns, Noonan fainted.

Another of Ms Burgess's sons, Desmond Noonan, was jailed earlier this year for hijacking a car and assaulting its driver,

Convicted criminals who have won large lottery prizes include rapist Iorworth Hoare, who received £7.2million in 2004.

Hoare, who raped a woman in Leeds, West Yorkshire, in 1988, bought his ticket while on day release from prison.

Another
criminal, Michael Carroll, of Downham Street, Norfolk, was wearing an 
electronic tag when he collected a £9.7m prize in 2002.

But in 2010 it emerged that he had returned to his old job as a binman after blowing the lot on drugs, gambling and prostitutes.
