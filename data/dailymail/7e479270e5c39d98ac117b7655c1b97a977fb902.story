With Gravity clearing up at the Oscars, you might think that nothing could top Sandra Bullock and George Clooney antics in space.

But Nasa has just outdone Hollywood by releasing these mind-blowing real life ‘Gravity’ images revealing incredible scenes of Earth, astronauts and space shuttles.

While Alfonso Cuaron’s film relies heavily on computer-generated imagery, the space agency has shown that our galaxy is far more beautiful than anything a film director could create.

The city lights of Spain and Portugal define the Iberian Peninsula in this photograph from the International Space Station (ISS). Several large metropolitan areas are visible, marked by their relatively large and brightly lit areas, including the capital cities of Madrid, Spain - located near the centre of the peninsula. The astronaut view is looking toward the east

The ‘Gravity: Nasa’s real-life images from space’ series uses photos taken over the last several years and covers everything from space walks to the final landing on Earth.

Some of the most stunning are of views from the International Space Station of our planet by night.

In one image, the city lights of Spain and Portugal are clearly visible. Several large metropolitan areas can be seen, including the capital city of Madrid.

The bright sun greets the International Space Station in this November 22 scene from the Russian section of the orbital outpost, photographed by one of the astronauts

Mission Specialist Bruce McCandless II, is seen further away from the confines and safety of his ship than any previous astronaut has ever been. This space first was made possible by the Manned Manuevering Unit or MMU, a nitrogen jet propelled backpack.  McCandless went free-flying to a distance of 320 feet (98 metres) away from the Orbiter. This image was taken in 1984

From 220 miles above Earth, one of the
 Expedition 25 crew members took another night time photo featuring the 
bright lights of Cairo and Alexandria, Egypt on the Mediterranean coast.

The Nile River and its 
delta stand out clearly and, on the horizon, the airglow of the 
atmosphere is seen across the Mediterranean.

Nasa
 also takes a look back at landmarks in spacewalks, such as that set by 
mission specialist Bruce McCandless II over two decades ago.

In
 a 1984 image, McCandless is seen further away from the confines and 
safety of his ship than any previous astronaut has ever been.

This unique photographic angle, featuring the International Space Station's Cupola and crew activity inside it, other hardware belonging to the station, city lights on Earth and airglow was captured by one of the Expedition 28 crew members. The major urban area on the coast is Brisbane, Australia. The station was passing over an area southwest of Canberra

But
 it’s not just space flight that can provide moving views of an 
expedition. Candid shots of astronauts coming back down to Earth reveal 
the how arduous space flight can be.

Last
 night, Gravity swept the board at the 86th Academy Awards with seven 
Oscars, including best visual effects, cinematography and original 
score.

This montage of three frames shows the Soyuz TMA-17 spacecraft as it lands with Expedition 23 Commander Oleg Kotov and Flight Engineers T.J. Creamer and Soichi Noguchi near the town of Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan on Wednesday, June 2, 2010

Astronaut Sunita L. Williams, Expedition 14 flight engineer, used a pistol grip tool as she worked on the International Space Station in the first of three spacewalks slated to occur over a nine-day period. During the 7-hour 55-minute spacewalk that took place in 2007

A picturesque line of thunderstorms and numerous circular cloud patterns filled the view as the International Space Station (ISS) Expedition 20 crew members looked out at the limb (blue line on the horizon) of the Earth

A close-up of Astronaut John Grunsfeld shows the reflection of Astronaut Andrew Feustel, perched on the robotic arm and taking the photo. The pair teamed together on three of the five spacewalks during Servicing Mission 4 in May 2009

Commenting on the 
film last year, Mark Uhran, who retired in 2012 as a Nasa director for 
the ISS, said: ‘My first reaction was that the cinematography was of 
spectacular realism.

‘I’ve 
never seen that done before. I’ve never seen a Hollywood filmmaker 
actually be able to capture that clarity and resolution of the space 
station and shuttle.’

But while Gravity may have received Uhran’s seal of approval, these images show that fact is much more stunning than fiction.

With his feet secured on a restraint on the space station remote manipulator system's robotic arm or Canadarm2, NASA astronaut Mike Fossum (frame centre) holds the Robotics Refueling Mission payload, which was the focus of one of the primary chores accomplished on a six and a half hour spacewalk on July 12 2011

Russian support personnel work to help get Expedition 29 crew members out of the Soyuz TMA-02M spacecraft shortly after the capsule landed with Expedition 29 Commander Mike Fossum, and Flight Engineers Sergei Volkov and Satoshi Furukawa in a remote area outside of the town of Arkalyk, Kazakhstan, on Tuesday, November 22, 2011
