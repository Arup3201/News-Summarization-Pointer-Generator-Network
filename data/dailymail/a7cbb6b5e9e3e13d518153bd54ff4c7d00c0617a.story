Two Americans who were soldiers for the Israel Defense Force were killed in fighting in the Gaza Strip.

Stuart Steinberg confirmed the death of his son Max Steinberg, 24, to The Associated Press on Sunday. Steinberg, whose family lives in Southern California's San Fernando Valley, was a sharpshooter for the Golani Brigade.

He was one of 13 Israeli soldiers and 65 Palestinians killed in fighting Sunday during the first major ground battle in two weeks of fighting between Israel and Hamas.

Texas: Nissim Sean Carmeli, from South Padre Island, Texas, was killed in combat in the Gaza Strip

Earlier 
Sunday, the IDF said in a statement that Sgt. Nissim Sean Carmeli, 21, 
was killed in combat in the Gaza Strip. Carmeli was from South Padre 
Island, Texas, said Deputy Consul General of Israel to the Southwest 
Maya Kadosh. She said Carmeli moved to Israel four years ago and added 
that the consulate helped his family get a flight there Sunday.

Rabbi
 Asher Hecht of Chabad of the Rio Grande Valley, who is a longtime 
family friend, said Carmeli joined the Israeli army after finishing high
 school in Israel and was in the Golani Brigade. The IDF statement said 
Carmeli was from Ra'anana, Israel.

'He
 had great energy, yet had a kind and gentle soul,' Hecht said. 'It's 
been a very tough day for us,' he added. 'We lost a gem.'

Carmeli
 was the youngest of three and has two sisters who currently live in 
Israel. He was 'loved by his parents infinitely,' Hecht said.

Steinberg was living in Beersheba, Israel. He attended Pierce College and El Camino Real High School in Southern California.

After visiting Israel, Steinberg decided to return and join the IDF in December 2012

Carmeli was one of 19 Israeli soldiers killed in two days of fighting in the Gaza Strip

He
 visited Israel for the first time on a Birthright Israel trip with his 
younger brother and sister in June 2012, his father said. When he 
returned, he made an announcement to his parents that he was planning to
 return and join the IDF, Steinberg said. He made good on that promise 
less than six months later, making the move in December.

'He
 went back," Steinberg said. 'He was completely dedicated and committed 
to serving the country of Israel. He was focused, he was clear in what 
the mission was, and he was dedicated to the work he needed to be 
doing.'

On
 Sunday morning, the Steinbergs were visited by representatives from the
 Consulate General of Israel in Los Angeles. They broke the news of Max 
Steinberg's death.

Stuart
 Steinberg last spoke to his son at 4 a.m. Saturday California time, 
hours before his death. Max Steinberg called his father to tell him that
 his group had been injured when two of their tanks collided. They had 
to return to Israel for treatment at the hospital. Some soldiers had 
broken bones, and Max Steinberg had sprained his back, his father said.

'He
 called me up at 4 a.m. that morning and said he'd be returning to Gaza,
 back to combat, to be with his friends,' Steinberg said.

Steinberg
 said the family is leaving on Monday for Israel, where their son will 
be buried. On Max Steinberg's Facebook page, hundreds of people liked a 
profile photo that appeared to be a selfie of him in uniform, armed, 
with his helmet on. Dozens gave their condolences.

Jay
 Sanderson, who heads The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles, said
 in an email message to the community that 'our thoughts are with his 
family and our community is committed to support them in any way they 
need - and to honor Max's memory.'

The
 Jewish Federations of North America said in a statement that its 
'deepest sympathies' were with the families of 18 Israeli soldiers 
killed over the last two days. 'Along with all of Israel, and the entire
 Jewish People, we mourn their loss as if they were our own,' the 
statement said.

On Sunday night, the U.S. State Department confirmed the deaths of Steinberg and Carmeli.
