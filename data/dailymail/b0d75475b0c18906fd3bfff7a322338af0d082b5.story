A  beggar commutes more than 200 miles to sit in a doorway outside an exclusive  London restaurant where he accepts cash using his own chip and pin machine, it was revealed today.

Damien Preston-Booth, 37, has taken money from the rich, tourists and celebrities to pay for gadgets like an iPad and trips across Europe, while apparently claiming benefits. 

On his Facebook page today he posted a picture of himself with music mogul Simon Cowell in the West End with the caption: 'Simon didn't give me 50 pounds it was 20'.

Celebrities: Mr Preston-Booth is pictured here with Sharon Osbourne and Louis Walsh outside a Mayfair club

Defence: Mr Preston-Booth said that the music mogul gave him £20 and he has also admitted he has a chip and pin card reader for 'regulars'

Mr Preston-Booth travels by bus, train or rental car from Preston in Lancashire to Mayfair and spends Thursdays to Sundays taking cash from passers-by and card payments from 'regulars'.

He was last seen in the area over Christmas and New Year, local businesses have said. 

He usually finds a spot outside a Lebanese restaurant but is said to book into a nearby hotel if the weather is inclement.  

Upset: A friend claims the beggar, pictured in Spain, is 'taking everyone for a ride' and made around £4,500 over the New Year period - including £1,000 from a rich Arab outside the Dorchester Hotel

Using the cash he has travelled to  Monaco, Paris, Ibiza and Bruges in the past six months.

A friend claims he is 'taking everyone for a ride' and made around £4,500 over the New Year period - including £1,000 from a rich Arab outside the Dorchester Hotel.

The 37-year-old is renting a £300-a-month flat but appears to have been saying he has been homeless for five years. 

Mr Preston-Booth is also believed to be on Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for his depression, which could earn him up to £108 a week.

It is now likely he will face a benefit fraud investigation, a Government source told MailOnline. Mr Preston-Booth has been contacted for comment by MailOnline.

Other beggars have said that they are 'scared' of Mr Preston-Booth, who denies he is a bully and claims he gives cash to others on the streets.  

His Facebook profile shows he has been flying all over Europe since the summer and he told online friends he had a 'great year'.

In  July pictures show he spent time in Ibiza and came home to the UK via Paris. A month later he spent some time in Monaco.

Mr Preston-Booth says he is £100-a-fortnight in benefits for depression and denies he is pocketing thousands from his begging activities.

He told James Mills from The Sun: 'I'm saving up for a little flat and I'm trying to get a CV together so I can get a job.

'I have nothing to hide. I've been homeless and I did beg while I was in London and I have been down since I got my flat in October. I do it to buy things for the flat — not like smackheads who spend it on drugs and beers'.

He said his trips abroad were to look for work and he slept rough and got his chip and pin reader when he was selling the Big Issue.

His main haunt appears to be the Mamounia Lounge on Curzon Street - a hotspot for the rich and famous. 

Chief porter Emil Staykov, 45, told the Evening Standard said: 'That guy is really arrogant. He asks our customers for money as they go in and then sleeps in the doorway.

'I have called the police on him loads of times and have been tempted just to throw him out myself. I knew he had money, he always had two phones.

'He was horrible to the restaurant staff but would then be all smiles and jokes with the customers so they gave him money. That is a guy I do not like. We do not want him back'.

Jetting off: The beggar was pictured here at Stansted last year but said his trips abroad were to find work

New home: The beggar says his begging helps him by things for his new £300-a-month flat

Yesterday The Sun said he bought himself a coffee machine, a bathroom cabinet and a plug in grill with more than £100 in total for his new flat.

Friends defended him today and one said: 'Everybody has to earn a living damo. There's no judgement here pal'. 

A female friend told him in an online message: 'You're brill Damien' and another said: 'Damien, you are a legend!'

Mayfair business owners alleged Damien Preston-Booth would even arrive in his car before pounding the streets pretending to be disabled to rake in thousands of pounds on the streets of Mayfair.

Damien Preston-Booth, 37, is believed to be on Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for his depression, which could earn him up to £108 a week.

The Government allows ESA to be paid to people of working age who are too ill to work because of a health condition or disability. 

You must be under state pension age, not getting statutory sick pay or statutory maternity pay and not receiving any jobseeker's allowance. 

In order to qualify you will have be assessed and after that can earn another £104 a week on top of your benefits for certain types of work.

But Mr Preston-Booth's  begging - which is illegal in Britain and punishable by a £1,000 fine - could be considered benefit fraud.

The Department for Work and Pensions told MailOnline it never comments on individual cases. 

However a spokesman said: 'Benefit fraud is a crime and our fraud investigaters will look into all suspected cases.

'If you suspect someone of claiming benefits fraudulently you can report it to the Benefit Fraud Hotline on National Benefit Fraud Hotline 0800 854 440'.

Manager Emile Salame said: 'He's a clever man – he speaks to the tourists with a bit of French, Spanish or Arabic.

'When the Arabs come over in the summer he says hello to them in Arabic and gets some money. I've seen some of those guys give him £50 at a time. 

'I did wonder if he is homeless. He has two or three phones, an iPad, a camera. We see him outside every night but we've not seen him since last week. He's always on the move but he stays in this area.

'As a homeless man I don't think he should be doing that with the card machine. He told me it was given to him by the Big Issue.

'We've given him sandwiches and hot drinks before but we've had to get the police to move him on from sleeping right outside the restaurant.

'He drives a car though and one morning I even saw him arrive and get coffee out of the back of his car for some police officers.

'I don't think it's fair what he is doing. We all work hard and pay taxes and it pays to help out the genuine homeless people.

'I've seen him acting up and hobbling down the road before and pretending to be disabled, even though there is nothing wrong with him.

'And he dresses up for the occasion, so at Christmas he was wearing a Santa outfit. He's a real entrepreneur, he's making a real business out of it.' 

Police are looking to ban a fraudulent beggar from Mayfair.

Local businesses have grown fed-up with his behaviour and now police are urging them to put their complaints in writing to help them secure a ban against him.

The 37-year-old was moved on by officers after allegedly harassing a customer at Noura on December 20.

Mr Salame received a note from local officers asking him to fill out a business impact statement to help them apply for a criminal behaviour order against Preston-Booth that would prevent him from operating in the area.

He said: 'We are in the process of putting together everything in writing. It is not fair when we are trying to run a business and he is simply irritating customers.

'He was harrassing one of the female customers sitting outside, he was insisting on sitting with her and it wasn't really on.

'We called the police and we have an ongoing thing with them about harassment. He's a naughty person, he should be more respectful, especially with what he gets out of the area.'
