The craze for selfies has found a new Royal fan - the Duke of York.

Prince Andrew became the latest prominent public figure to take a spontaneous self-portrait who tweeted a photograph of himself during an event at St James’s Palace.

In the photograph Prince Andrew can be seen grinning into his mobile phone camera from the stage, while members of the delegation – dressed demurely in suits – laugh and take their own pictures of him on their phones.

The Prince first tweeted from his account, @TheDukeofYork: ‘Welcome to #pitchatpalace I wish you all a great event, both entrepreneurs and audience’, signed off by ‘AY’, indicating the tweet was written by him, rather than a member of staff.

He then tweeted the selfie, which is somewhat at odds with Palace protocol, not least because his other tweet included a picture of a notice which reads ‘Mobile phones are not permitted in the state rooms’, with the word ‘not’ crossed out with black tape.

Prince Andrew was hosting the final of his Pitch @ Palace competition, which looked for students interested in building their own start-up companies.

He joins Prince Charles, the Pope, Ed Miliband, Angela Merkel, David Cameron and Barack Obama who have all taken ‘selfies’ on their mobile phones, in the craze sparked by teenage girls on social media.
