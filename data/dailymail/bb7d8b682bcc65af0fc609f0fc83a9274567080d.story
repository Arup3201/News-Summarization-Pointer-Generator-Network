If there is one player I would have liked to have been it is Steven Gerrard. I feel very proud and honoured to have been on the same pitch as him.

Now he is leaving Liverpool I say one thing to him: do not retire. Go and play in America, you are a young man, you can carry on for five or six years.

And if, when the Major League Soccer season is closed and you are looking for a loan back to England, I know my dad would love to have him...

When you talk about Liverpool’s greatest players, you think about Kenny Dalglish and Graeme Souness; but they were surrounded by other fantastic players.

Steven Gerrard has carried Liverpool. He has been the captain, leader and inspiration for some poor teams.

He has been their Roy of the Rovers, their superman. We can remember those moments.

Against Olympiacos in 2004 in the Champions League when they were going out and he scored a rocket goal.

His header in the Champions League Final against AC Milan in Istanbul.

His match-winning performance against West Ham in the 2006 FA Cup Final when they had all but lost the game at Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium but, somehow, he won them the trophy.

The first time I saw him on the training pitch, I passed the ball and I expected him to send it back to me. He turned and pinged a 50-yard crossfield pass.

I can remember the noise; like a golfer hitting the sweet spot. I knew we had a player. When I told our manager Gerard Houllier, he thought I was talking about somebody else! But the players knew.

Some will say now that he should retire at the top, as a one-club player. I say that you are a long time retired. He has to play on for as long as he can.

He is only 34. He can still pass a ball as beautifully as anyone.

Why the MLS? He will know that the game in Europe is for young men. He has earned the chance to play the game at his pace.

He could play in Los Angeles with LA Galaxy or in New York with the Red Bulls, or even for David Beckham if the former England captain gets his Miami franchise off the ground in the future.

There are times when Gerrard has looked as if he is carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders this season, since Liverpool failed to win that coveted Premier League title last season. And since Luis Suarez departed for Barcelona and Daniel Sturridge has been injured, that has virtually been the case.

There hasn’t been the usual smile or the swagger we’ve associated with him during matches, and he has been moved around the pitch in a manner that has complicated his performances. I found myself thinking: ‘Just let him play’.

John Terry, Steven Gerrard and Dani Alves are free transfers and will be able to talk to foreign clubs once the transfer window opens... Stevie is more interesting; he can still do a job for Liverpool and I hope he stays, but he may feel the criticism has become unbearable. If he does stay, just let him play! There is too much ‘make him a holding midfielder’, or ‘let’s push him forward’. 

Now he can do that in America amid the relative calm of the MLS. He can be a superstar, just as Beckham was out there. Why now? He reads the newspapers, listens to the radio phone-ins, logs on to the websites. People have been saying he has lost his pace and that he is not the same player. He’s a sensitive boy and such criticism and comments will weigh on his mind.

This decision will not have been easy for him — it will have hurt him. He loves Liverpool and it has been his club. He’s their talisman and it was his ambition to win them a title.

It was difficult, too, for him to turn down Chelsea when Jose Mourinho first came calling, but this will have been just as tough.

The hardest thing is to visualise him in another kit, with another badge on his chest. Some will say he is like a boxer coming towards the end; don’t take one more fight.

It’s different for Frank Lampard. We all remember him at West Ham, before he moved to Chelsea. Now he is at Manchester City.

Steven has played 695 games for Liverpool; we aren’t used to seeing him in another strip, apart from England. But I still think he should play on.

Gerrard has been an inspirational captain for more than a decade, leading the team since 2003

I remember reading in his book how anxious he was when he first joined up with England, and that I had to get him from his room before a meal to bring him down to join the rest of the squad. I don’t recall that. I just remember him being a superhero from the moment I set eyes on him. What a player!

But I don’t want this to read like an obituary. I want it to be a reflection of his brilliant career and I hope there is more to come. The moment when you make that run, you make that tackle, you score that goal … if you retire, you never get that back again. You don’t get any medals for being a one club man. While you can still do it, then do it.

I don’t see him as a manager — and he doesn’t need the money anyway. He’d be good on TV. No, he’d be a superstar. But that can come at a later date. He’s still got the legs to play, to reinvent himself.

He doesn’t owe anything to anyone. This is his time. Walk out with your head held high, Stevie.

And keep on playing.
