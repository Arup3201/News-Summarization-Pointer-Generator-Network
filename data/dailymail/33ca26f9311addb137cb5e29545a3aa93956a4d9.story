Fitness guru Kortney Olson does it all.

The certified personal trainer from the Gold Coast is also an Olympic weightlifting coach, three time international body builder competitor, cross fit yoga junkie and Australia's first female arm wrestling champion.

One of Kortney's most passionate projects has been helping young women to build confidence and accept their body image.

But a recent decision to have a breast enlargement has sparked questions as to whether the trainer herself has acceptance of her own body image?

It would suggest that she does, after posting a story of her breast augmentation from an A cup to a D cup, on her online blog to tell fans what was going on and how the surgery has not changed her one bit.

Referring to herself as Boob Job Betty, Kortney praised her surgeon, Dr. Ces Rhymes with the work he has done in putting in her 500cc implants.

'I can't begin to tell you how much more sexier I feel. How feminine..... having muscles, a half shaved head and small pecks have been great but there is definitely a side of me that has felt my femininity slipping down the drain,' she said.

The trainer, who got the breast enlargement last month has seemingly been very transparent with her decision to get the surgery and has added a little humour to the situation.

'Girls make sure you marry a man who picks you up from a breast augmentation that he financed/paid for and a bouquet of gorgeous flowers.'

The blog went on to say, 'I fully intended for paying for my own job but my husband's main purpose in life is to find ways to create joys and happiness for me.'

Her decision to get breast enlargements got plenty of support from her fans

One supporter on facebook said 'I love you and I love your work'

One facebook fan supported Kortney's decision and felt it was one she did for herself

'I had a short window of time where I could have the job done, so he insisted on paying and moving forward.'

'Anyway, let me please tell you that this was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life.' 

Kortney has hit back at anyone that wants to make assumptions about her decision to have her breasts enlarged, which included an article by the Gold Coast Bulletin.

She returned fire by saying on social media, 'At least they've stopped calling me an 'ex controversial porn star' in the headlines!'

'Who gives a s**t what people say about you, the only opinion that matter of yourself, is your own,' she said.

The post received a lot of attention from her fans, who made numerous comments supporting her decision.

'Keep doing what you do Kort. You're an inspiration with boobs and without. Positive impact is all that matters,' one user wrote.

Another said, 'I love you and I love your work,' while one commented, 'it's not for men, it's for herself.' 

Kortney Olson came under the media spotlight in 2012.

The trainer from the Gold Coast is a certified personal trainer, Olympic weightlifting coach, three time international body builder competitor, cross fit yoga junkie and Australia's first female arm wrestling champion

The trainer, who admitted to a past life of drug abuse, being a former fetish porn star and rape, joined the Gold Coast Titans, with husband, David May, as the CEO, as a volunteer to help with strength and conditioning.

She defended her right to be there when a parent of a junior player called for her and her husband to be sacked. 

Kortney launched Kamp Konfidence with her husband a year ago, a Not For Profit company aimed at empowering females by teaching the tools, habits, and principles that aid in developing self love.

She told the Gold Coast Bulletin she wanted to balance her top half to match her muscular lower body for competitions.

'I had started to look in the mirror and thought wow, I look like a 15-year-old boy,' she said.

Despite the stigma attached to cosmetic surgery, she believes women should be able to make their own choices. 

'People change ... as long as you know who you are inside, that's all that matters,' she told the Gold Coast Bulletin.
