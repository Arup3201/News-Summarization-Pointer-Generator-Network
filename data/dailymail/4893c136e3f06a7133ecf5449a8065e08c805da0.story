He may be well into his retirement, but Bob Hawke proved that he still remains patriotic to the country he once led.

The former Australian prime minister proved to be in high spirits on Sunday as he took the microphone to belt out the well-known bush ballad, Waltzing Matilda while at a Mother's Day event in the Hunter Valley.

'On a day like this there’s no other song to song than Waltzing Matilda,' Hawke declared before taking the stage, according to the Daily Telegraph.
