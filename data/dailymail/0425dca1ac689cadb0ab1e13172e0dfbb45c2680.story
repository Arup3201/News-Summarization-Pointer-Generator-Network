Former Tory MP Edwina Currie was ordered off Twitter this morning by her husband

Former Tory MP Edwina Currie was ordered off Twitter this morning by her husband after she was rounded on by people slating her for saying people who use food banks spend their cash on tattoos and dog food.

Speaking on a BBC Radio Stoke last week, the 67-year-old former MP said food banks were not a long term solution and questioned whether they were really needed in the UK.

She said many people using food banks across UK spent any spare cash they had - not on food - but on tattoos and food for their pets.

She said: 'I get very, very troubled at the number of people who are using food banks who think that it's fine to pay to feed their dog, their dog is in good nick and beautiful, but they never learn to cook, they never learn to manage and the moment they've got a bit of spare cash they're off getting another tattoo.

'We should feel cross about this, all of us.'

Labour MP Tom Watson tweeted after the radio show was broadcast last week: '@Edwina-Currie your comments on food bank users are appalling.'

And on Twitter last night, scores of people vented their anger at the former Tory MP - who was the first dancer to be eliminated from Strictly in 2011 - saying her comments were vile.

In the end the former politician - who was forced to resign from her job as a junior health minister in 1988 after wrongly saying that the majority of egg production in the UK was affected by salmonella - was ordered off Twitter by her husband John Jones, a retired police detective who spent 35 years in the force.

At 1.15am today - after a barrage of abuse on Twitter - she tweeted: 'Hubby is demanding I stop tweeting and go pay him some attention. I hear and obey'

At 1.15am today - after a barrage of abuse on Twitter - she tweeted: 'Hubby is demanding I stop tweeting and go pay him some attention. I hear and obey.'

She had previously tried to defend her comments, tweeting last night: 'Some councils are diverting money from services into food banks. I think this is crazy - a real abrogation of responsibility.'

She also tweeted: 'How do we solve people's problems? Not by giving them a can of soup and saying there, there.'

Other tweets from the ex-Tory MP included 'Some others need real help, not sticking plaster tins of soup' and 'Food banks don't solve problems. They just ensure people go on living with problems. For decades'.

Twitter users slammed her comments, with Michael Greenwell tweeting: 'Wow. I couldn't have imagined Edwina Currie would say anything more stupid, but she's managed it.'

Peter Smith tweeted: 'It's SO much easier to attack the poor than attack poverty isn't it @Edwina-Currie? Man at our local foodbank cos he couldn't afford food after travelling 45 miles to his 0 hours min wage job. Explain that @Edwina-Currie.'

The number of people using food banks has tripled since 2012 and charity The Trussell Trust - which provide hundreds of foodbanks across the UK - said around 1m people regularly use them

Labour MP Chris Bryant, the Shadow Minister for Welfare Reform, tweeted: 'Edwina Currie hasn't the foggiest idea how ordinary people live their lives but resorts to crude judgementalism. Sad.'

Shaysda tweeted: 'So @Edwina-Currie thinks food banks don't help people out of trouble, they merely perpetuate it, & users are tattoo wearing devil dog owners.'

Louise Brown tweeted: 'Edwina Currie quick to cast judgement on ppl she says are tattooed chain smoking scroungers yet cast Savile as harmless philanthropist;idiot.'

In 2012, Edwina Currie defending giving pervert Jimmy Savile a role at Broadmoor in 1988 after appointing him as part of a taskforce at the hospital when she was a junior health minister.

Savile was subsequently accused of sexually abusing patients at the high security hospital.

The number of people using foodbanks has tripled since 2012 and charity The Trussell Trust - which provide hundreds of foodbanks across the UK - said around 1m people regularly use them.

Rob Flello, Labour's MP for Stoke-on-Trent South, said he was 'incensed' by the former health minister's comments.

He said: 'Mrs Currie's remarks are outrageous. I find it astonishing that a former health minister who claims to have her finger on the pulse should express such ill-informed views that are completely divorced from reality.'

'I invite Mrs Currie to spend a day with me in the Potteries talking to people who run and use foodbanks. Only then may she realise how out of touch she really is.'

Nikki Sinclaire, MEP for the West Midlands - and who has helped to donate and deliver three tons of food to foodbanks - said he was disgusted by the former MP's comments.

She said: 'This type of perpetuating myth that poor people are filling their boots, people on benefits, not all people that go to foodbanks are on benefits.

'Generally foodbanks work on a system where they can only go there two or three times.

'The comments Edwina is making, I find that they have no relation to reality.'

Arthur Heath, of Stoke, said: 'This from a woman that went along with the biggest transfer of wealth from poor to the rich in history.

'Thatcher and her cronies, including the despicable Ms Currie, set out to create a system whereby the wealthy thrive on the misery of the underclass.'?

Edwina tweeted that her husband John Jones had ordered her off Twitter

Geraldine Benson, 51, said: 'Edwina Currie's comments are vile and a disgusting insult on people living on the poverty line.

'If she thinks people on the breadline with children are using any spare money they get on tattoos and buying dog food she is not living in the real world.

'People using foodbanks are in urgent need - they do not to feel like paupers because they have a dog or have a tattoo

During Edwina Currie's interview on BBC Radio Stoke she also said she couldn't see how foodbanks were useful.

She said: 'For the life of me I can't see how giving someone a tin of soup when they are suffering from a mental illness or when they've got debt problems is going to contribute in any long term way to solving their problems.

'It is such a short term help. If people have got into debt one of the key things that they should be asking themselves is why did I get into debt and what did I do that was stupid to get into debt and what can I avoid doing in the future?

'How do I actually take control of my life so that I am not in this situation?'

She added: 'One of the things I think an older generation like myself and perhaps even older than that, like my grandparents who lived in real poverty in Liverpool, what they all realised is that difficult times do come and that what you have to do in the good times is to put a little bit of money to one side to make sure that you have got that as support.'
