President Barack Obama is prescribing time and vigilance to tackle problems as entrenched in American society as racism and bias.

He also is urging patience, saying progress usually comes in small steps.

In an interview with BET, the president described his conversation with a group of young civil rights activists, including a leader of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, he hosted last week in the Oval Office.

His comments come after New York Mayor Bill de Blasio suggested that the United States is confronting 'centuries of racism,' after a week of protests that shook major cities across the country.

Speaking from experience he said he feared for his son's safety when dealing police officers, adding: 'It's different for a white child, it's just a reality in this country.'

Obama said he told them that 'this is something that is deeply rooted in our society, it's deeply rooted in our history.'

America has made gains, he said, and that 'gives us hope' of making more progress.

'We can't equate what is happening now to what was happening 50 years ago,' Obama said, 'and if you talk to your parents, grandparents, uncles, they'll tell you that things are better, not good in some places, but better.'

Obama said he is advising young people to be persistent because 'typically progress is in steps, it's in increments.'

In dealing with something 'as deeply rooted as racism or bias in any society, you've got to have vigilance but you have to recognize that it's going to take some time and you just have to be steady so that you don't give up when you don't get all the way there,' Obama said. 

New York has become the center point of the demonstrations demanding justice for black men who have died at the hands of white policemen in recent weeks.

'We have to have an honest conversation in this country about a history of racism, we have to have an honest conversation about the problems that have caused parents to feel that their children may be in danger in their dynamics with police, when in fact police are there to protect them,' Mayor De Blasio told ABC News.

New York mayor Bill de Blasio, pictured with his wife Chirlane McCray in April, has said that the US is facing 'centuries of racism' following protests in the city last week 

'Our police keep us safe, and yet there's been not just decades of problems, a history of centuries of racism that undergird this reality.'

De Blasio, who is white and married to a black woman with whom he has mixed-race children, added: 'We have to retrain police forces in how to work with communities differently, we have to work on things like body cameras that will provide a different level of transparency and accountability.

'This is something systemic and we bluntly have to talk about the historical racial dynamics underlying (it).'

Speaking from personal experience, de Blasio told ABC that he feared for his son's safety in dealing with the police.

'What parents have done for decades with children of color, especially young men of color, is train them to be very careful, when they have a connection with a police officer, when they have an encounter with a police officer,' he said.

'It's different for a white child, it's just a reality in this country.

'And with Dante, very early on, my son, we used to say, look, if a police officer stops you, do everything he tells you to do, don't move suddenly, don't reach for your cellphone, because we knew, sadly, there is a greater chance it might be misinterpreted if it was a young man of color.'

He continued: 'There's that fear that there could be that moment of misunderstanding with a young man of color, and that young man may never come back.'

New York has been the focal point of demonstrations in the past week following the decision by a grand jury not to indict the officer involved in the death of Eric Garner 

Last weekend protesters walked through various locations in the city, including Union Square, to protest the recent police killings
