New research has shown the pre-season buzz around Old Trafford has died down somewhat with a drop in confidence towards Louis van Gaal from supporters.

Following a disastrous campaign last season, finishing 7th, Van Gaal has been set the task of bringing the glory days back to Old Trafford, but following their opening day defeat to Swansea some fans have raised doubts already.

Statistics collected from 160,000 football fans on the Forza Football app has revealed the confidence supporters had in their managers prior to and after their respective opening fixtures. 

Confidence: Man City showed the highest increase from prior to the season with Sunderland the highest overall

And after 90 per cent optimism from United fans in Van Gaal prior to their season opener against the Swans, things quickly changed as it dropped to 86 per cent following the 2-1 home defeat.

Elsewhere other teams who made up the top six last season all showed a marked increase following their opening weekend results, bar Arsenal and Liverpool who despite edging past Crystal Palace and Southampton went down one percent to 86 in the former's case with Liverpool remaining at 85 percent.

Manchester City fans showed the biggest increase in confidence towards their manager Manuel Pellegrini with a seven per cent sway after an encouraging opening day victory at Newcastle.

Chelsea supporters have continued their unwavered support to Jose Mourinho, as they showed a one per cent rise from 86%. Elsewhere the Everton contingency now have 87 per cent confidence in Roberto Mancini following their 2-2 draw to Leicester as opposed to 85 beforehand.

Disappointing: United fell to a 2-1 home defeat in Louis van Gaal's first game in charge

Surprising: The survey showed a 27 per cent drop in confidence towards Sean Dyche from Burnley fans

Contrasting: Allardyce is under fire from West Ham supporters while Mourinho is adored by the Chelsea faithful

Elsewhere, the highest manager confidence percentage overall is Sunderland with 88% with fans clearly huge supporters of Gus Poyet, who done a superb job last term as they performed the great escape. 

Way down at the bottom are West Ham, with supporters showing just a 40% manager confidence average in boss Sam Allardyce.

There was a two per cent drop in Allardyce from fans following their last-gasp defeat to London rivals Spurs at Upton Park.

Perhaps surprisingly Burnley had the biggest drop in confidence following the opening weekend's results, as they were beaten convincingly by Chelsea at Turf Moor.

The newly-promoted side showed 89 per cent confidence towards manager Sean Dyche prior to their first game but that soon dropped by 27 per cent after they lost to Chelsea.

The biggest surprise of all the findings was perhaps Hull, as after a excellent win at QPR on the opening day, fan manager confidence dropped down three per cent from 87 per cent.

Although this could be explained as fans may well be concerned at what Steve Bruce will do in the remaining time left in the transfer market, following the news summer signing Robert Snodgrass faces up to six months on the sidelines with a knee injury.
