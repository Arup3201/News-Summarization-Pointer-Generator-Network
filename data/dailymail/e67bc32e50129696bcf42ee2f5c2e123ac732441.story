Caked in flour, covered in egg yolk and charging through a flurry of firecrackers, these revellers took to the streets to celebrate a Spanish festival in bizarre fashion. 

The citizens of Ibi, in south-east Spain, dressed up in mock military uniforms to mark the 'Els Enfarinats' festival and pelted each other with flour and eggs.

The 200-year-old festival is part of the celebrations of the Day of the Innocents with a battle outside the town hall.

The 200-year-old festival is part of the celebrations of the Day of Innocents with a battle using flour, eggs and firecrackers 

'La Oposicio' try to restore order in the wake of the 'Els Enfarinats' - who take control of the town for one day and cause chaos 

 The 'Els Enfarinats' pronounce a host of ridiculous laws and fine citizens that infringe them - those who refuse are held in jail 

Starting at 8am, the battle takes place between two groups - the 'Els Enfarinats' - who take control of the town for one day under the slogan 'New Justice' and another group called 'La Oposicio', who try to restore order. 

An hour after the battle commences, the 'Race for Mayor' decides who will be the leader of the 'Els Enfarinats'.

Once a Mayor has been elected, the group pronounce a host of ridiculous laws and fine citizens that infringe them. 

At midday, a collection takes place through the streets of the old quarter of the town. 

At the end of the day, the authority of 'Els Enfarinats' comes to an end and money collected from the fines is donated to charitable causes in the town. 

The festival has been celebrated since 1981, when the town of Ibi recovered the tradition.

The Spanish are known for their bizarre food-throwing traditions.

Every year they launch tomatoes at each other during the Tomatina Festival which takes place in the town of Bunol in August.

In the same month, in Pobla del Duc near Valencia, residents hurl 40 tons worth of grapes at one another to celebrate the end of long growing season for farmers dating back to the 1930s.
