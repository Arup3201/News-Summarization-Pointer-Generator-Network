Tragic: Jasmyn Chan, 14, died at the scene when she and her 12-year-old friend were hit by a car

A teenage girl killed by a hit-and-run driver was last night hailed as a hero after apparently saving the life of her friend.

Jasmyn Chan, 14, died after being struck by a car on Friday evening just yards from her home in Sheffield.

Her friend Tia Tucker, 12, was seriously hurt but survived. She is being treated in hospital.

Yesterday, friends and family of the teenager,  who went by the nickname ‘Jazzy’, paid tribute to her and suggested that she may have saved Tia’s life by pushing her out of the way of the car.

Her aunt Christine, 52, told the Sunday Mirror: 'What Jasmyn did was amazing. When she saw the car she pushed Tia out of the way.

'I spoke to Tia briefly [yesterday] morning. I don't think it has dawned on her yet what happened.'

Mark Tucker said on Facebook: ‘RIP Jazzy. Our Tia told me what you did, legend.’ Holly Wilson added: ‘A true hero, always done everything for other people, never put yourself first.’

Yesterday, dozens of flowers were laid at the scene of the crash.

One message read: ‘In school, I never saw you without a smile on your 
face. You brightened up a room just by your presence. You were just a 
beautiful, smart young lady with such a kind heart.’

Another said: ‘I 
can’t believe you’ve been taken from us.’

The crash happened at 
9.20pm as the girls and three other friends were crossing Normanton Hill
 in Sheffield, near to Richmond Park.

Jasmyn lived with her parents 
and younger sister just a few hundred yards away. South Yorkshire Police
 last night confirmed they were looking at the possibility that the 
teenager had died protecting her friend.

A spokesman said: ‘We are 
aware of that suggestion and we are  looking at that as part of the 
investigation. It is a possible line.’

Ch Insp Stuart Walne said Jasmyn was ‘an active, friendly girl who was very giving’. He
 added: ‘This situation is even more upsetting as the driver didn’t stop
 at the scene.

'The driver may not have intended to cause this collision 
nor are they likely to have been aware of the extent of the injuries 
they caused.

‘I would urge them to think about the impact on Jasmyn’s family and please come forward.’

He
 said that the car – which has been described as small and possibly 
dark-green – could have been a Volkswagen or Honda. It would  have 
sustained damage to the front and the driver’s side.

The accident happened at the bottom of
 a long, straight hill on the 30mph road. Skid marks stretching for 
about 70 yards could clearly be seen on the road surface today.
