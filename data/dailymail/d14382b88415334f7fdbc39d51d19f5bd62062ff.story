New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez tested positive for a banned substance in 2006, sources linked to baseball's drug tests have revealed.

But the damning results were never disclosed because a Major League player must fail two drug tests before his name is released.

The 38-year-old's legal team has denied the claims and has accused senior baseball officials of leaking the evidence because they are 'desperate' to win the drug arbitration case against the athlete, The New York Times reported.

The revelations have also raised concerns about the credibility of past statements the player has made about his connection with performance-enhancing drugs.

Confidential: New York Yankees' star Alex Rodriguez tested positive for a banned substance in 2006, but his name was not released because of Major League drug test regulations

The third baseman is in the middle of a heated legal battle to overturn the 211-game 
ban handed down by MLB in August to him and 13 other players.

He was given the suspension after violating doping regulations in the league's collective bargaining 
agreement and is the only player challenging the decision.

The uncovering of the failed drugs test will not lead to any further sanctions by the league, because players are only banned after their second substance offence, but his legal team claim it will damage his reputation even further.

James McCarroll, a lawyer for the 
three-time AL MVP, did not address whether Rodriguez had a positive 
test, only that he was not banned as a result.

He said: 'Alex Rodriguez was never suspended for use of stimulants or any violation of the MLB drug program.

'The
fact that MLB has resorted to leaking federally protected medical 
information about a player speaks volumes of the weakness of their case 
against Alex - and their desperation to secure a win in the arbitration,
at all costs.

Anthony Bosch, former boss of South Florida anti-aging clinic Biogenesis, is the star witness in the MLB case against Rodriguez. It has been alleged Biogenesis supplied baseball superstars with banned substances

In a 
statement, Larry Davis a former Clinton administration 
official working for Rodriguez's legal team, called for a government 
probe into MLB's methods. The league has admitted paying for documents and 
Rodriguez's lawyers have claimed baseball's representatives have 
intimidated witnesses.

'U.S.
authorities should initiate an investigation as to whether any federal 
crimes have been committed by MLB investigators as well as those in the 
Commissioner's office who may have been complicit in this misconduct.'

His legal representatives also claim that the player has abided by the confidentiality laws set out in the drugs agreement, while the league have gone against it.

When he arrived at spring training in 2008, Rodriguez said: 'Last year, I got tested 9 to 10 times. ... We have a very, very strict policy, and I think the game is making tremendous strides.'

The new revelation comes just three weeks after it was revealed the player paid 
$305,000 to buy evidence and hide potentially incriminating links to 
Biogenesis, the Florida clinic behind baseball's doping scandal.

As
the proceeding to end the dispute between Major League Baseball and 
Rodriguez reached its halfway point, it was revealed A-Rod 
handed over cash for documents that included videotapes and affidavits 
that could incriminate him or be used in defense against doping allegations, the New York Daily News reported.

Rodriguez is the only player contesting the ban and is allowed to play for the Yankees during his appeal.

A
source with knowledge of the closed-door proceedings, held in MLB's New
York Park Avenue offices, told the Daily News that A-Rod and his 
representatives confirmed during sworn testimony that Rodriguez forked 
over the $305,000 to buy the evidence from Biogenesis - a claim that 
boosts MLB's case against the fallen star.

But
with MLB seemingly set to strike out Rodriguez, A-Rod's team hit back 
with a counter claim that the league also paid cash to Biogenesis for 
its own evidence in the case.

The New York Post
claims its own source revealed that MLB Chief Operating Officer Rob 
Manfred testified on Thursday that he authorized a payment of $125,000 
in cash in return for documents from the Florida clinic.

But A-Rod's legal team denied the allegation the 38-year-old third baseman paid any money to acquire data from the disgraced anti-aging clinic.

'The notion that we paid any money for any Biogenesis documents is patently false, and anyone who is leaking this information knows it’s false,' said A-Rod attorney Joseph Tacopina.

But a third source told the Post the tit-for-tat claims over cash payments was all about the detail. Rodriguez apparently did acquire copies of Biogenesis information but did not pay for it, a point that shows just how much the he-said she-said desperate details of the proceeding have turned ugly.

Alex Rodriguez strikes out against the Tampa Bay Rays at Yankee Stadium in September. His 211-game ban is not in effect while he appeals the decision. A-Rod's career could be on the line as the MLB doping dispute gets ugly and uglier

A Post source claimed Manfred's testimony stated a member of MLB's investigation team made one payment of $100,000 and a second payment of $25,000 to Gary Jones, a former Biogenesis employee, for information stolen from Biogenesis founder Tony Bosch.

After receiving his 211-game ban based on connections to Biogenesis, Rodriguez sued MLB and included in his filing that: 'Dan Mullin of MLB purchased what were represented to be these stolen documents for $150,000 in cash, which was handed off in a bag at a Fort Lauderdale, Florida area restaurant.'

MLB denied those allegations and said: 'None of those allegations is relevant to the real issue: whether Mr. Rodriguez violated the Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program.'

Major League Baseball COO Rob Manfred said that if the league did buy evidence from third parties it was to reveal the illegal activities of players

Manfred said MLB buying evidence was legal.

'There is nothing wrong with purchasing documents in an investigation,' he told the Daily News. 'We did it in the course of trying to see if we had players using performance-enhancing drugs in violation of our agreement. I’ve acknowledged it previously.'

Arbiter Frederic Horowitz is expected to rule in December whether Rodriguez’s suspension by MLB will be hit out of the park or stand firm.

If confirmed, the ban will be the longest in MLB history.

A-Rod's career - and legacy - depend on the decision.
