The sentencing of former Premier League goalkeeper Carlo Nash has been adjourned after he failed to attend court.

Nash, who has played for clubs including Manchester City, Everton, Wigan Athletic, Middlesbrough, Crystal Palace, Stoke City and Norwich City, was clocked at 140mph by a traffic officer on the A11 at Wymondham in Norfolk.

The 40-year-old from Leftbank, Manchester, was stopped in a 70mph zone by a marked car with a speed detector on February 2 this year.

He did not appear at a previous hearing at Norwich Magistrates' Court but the bench found the case proved in his absence.

Tuesday's hearing was due to consider imposing a diving ban and any other penalty but Nash did not attend.

He sent a request through his solicitors for the matter to be transferred to a court nearer to his home.

The case was adjourned until August 15 when magistrates will decide how to proceed.

Nash was released by Norwich City, where he was third choice goalkeeper, following their relegation from the Premier League at the end of last season.

Veteran: Nash, who is now 40, has also played for Stoke, Manchester City and Preston among other clubs
