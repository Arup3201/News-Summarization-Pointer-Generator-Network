A four-year-old girl is recovering in hospital after falling over - and impaling her face on a screwdriver.

Jiali, from Tianshui, Gansu Province, China, fell on the household tool while visiting her grandmother.

She had been holding it in her hand when she slipped and fell face first, accidentally driving the implement - believed to be of the Phillips variety - up her nose.

Painful: Jiali, from Tianshui, Gansu Province, China, fell on the household tool while visiting her grandmother

She fell with such force that the screwdriver wedged itself just below her eye socket, narrowly missing her brain.

The little girl was rushed to hospital where medics performed a series of x-rays and CAT scans to see if any lasting damage had been caused.

Ouch: X-ray pictures and CAT scans showed that the screwdriver entered from Jiali's left nostril and penetrated to the bottom of her left eye socket

Up the nose: She had been holding it in her hand when she slipped and fell face first, accidentally driving the implement - believed to be of the Phillips variety - up her nose

Indeed, the screwdriver had lodged itself so firmly and close to her brain that doctors at first were unsure whether it would be possible to remove it without causing Jiali serious long-term damage.

Jiali was taken to the local hospital 
but was transferred two more times because staff felt they were unable 
to deal with the injury.

Concern: Jiali's mother comforts her before the operation could take place

Scanned: The screwdriver had lodged itself so firmly and close to her brain that doctors at first were unsure whether it would be possible to remove it without causing Jiali serious long-term damage

A source said: 'It really was touch and go for a while. There was a genuine concern that it would be impossible to remove it safely.

'The first two hospitals that she went to had no idea what to do. They had never seen anything like it before.'

But fortunately it was not Chief surgeon Yu Qin's first time removing a household implement from a child's face.

Experience: Fortunately it was not Chief surgeon Yu Qin's first time removing a household implement from a child's face

In theatre: Nurses and doctors gather round Jiali to during the delicate procedure to remove the screwdriver

On the mend: Nevertheless, Dr Qin was able to remove the screwdriver while also managing to preserve the little girl's looks

But even he was apprehensive.

He said: 'It's only 2-3mm from the bottom of the skull. It's very dangerous.'
