Manchester City are close to signing £32million French defender Eliaquim Mangala, further breaking the quota on overseas players permitted in a Premier League squad.

Mangala, 23, has agreed to join City from Porto and form a defensive partnership with Vincent Kompany that manager Manuel Pellegrini hopes will succeed at home and in the Champions League.

However, he will be City’s fourth foreign signing and that means Pellegrini must cut some of his existing foreigners.

Mangala follows the arrivals of £12m Brazilian midfielder Fernando, also from Porto, Frenchman Bacary Sagna on a free from Arsenal and Malaga’s Argentine goalkeeper Willy Caballero.

Clubs are limited to 17 overseas players over 21 who haven’t come through English academies and Mangala is City’s 19th.
