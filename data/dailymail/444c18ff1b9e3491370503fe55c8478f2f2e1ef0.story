Prepare to howl.

The biggest and brightest full moon of the year graces the sky today as our celestial neighbor swings closer to Earth than usual.

The supermoon will appear 14 percent larger and 30 per cent brighter than normal - the outcome of a cosmic quirk as the moon orbits within about 222,000 miles (357,000 kilometers) of our planet.

Some viewers may think the shining orb looks more dazzling, but it's actually an optical illusion.

The glowing disc is simply larger on the horizon next to trees and buildings.

But don't worry if you missed it. The supermoon's effect should still linger until at least Tuesday.

The word supermoon was coined in 1979 by astrologer Richard Nolle, according to USA Today.

Nolle used the term to describe a new or full moon that occurs when the moon is at or near its closest approach to Earth.

While this supermoon, which rose in the east yesterday, is spectacular, an even larger one is expected on September 28, 2015.

And the largest supermoon until 2034 will roll in on November 14, 2016.
