A 32-year-old man who leaped to his death from a Manhattan building on Saturday may have been having an argument with his two lovers moments before he fell, according to reports.

The victim, who has not been identified, fell from a 33rd-floor balcony of the Ritz Plaza on West 48th Street near Eighth Avenue about 8.45am.

He plunged 29 floors and landed on a fourth-floor balcony.

One witness told The New York Post the man had been arguing with two other men - believed to be a couple - at the time.

'It was a man yelling and (another) guy was holding him back,' the witness, who was on a balcony two floors above, told The Post.

'All I heard was yelling, and then he went down and we heard a ''boom''.

'The guy [on the balcony] was screaming, ''help''.

The Post said the relationship between the victim and the couple was possible romantic and 'an open relationship type thing', citing a source.

Another witness said the body 'split in half'.
