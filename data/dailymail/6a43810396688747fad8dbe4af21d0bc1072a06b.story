Robert Downey Jr was well aware of his son's struggle with drug addiction and has tried everything to help him, according to a family friend.

Now Downey is making sure Indio Downey is getting the treatment he needs. Indio chas entered a rehab facility in Malibu following his arrest for possession of cocaine on Sunday.

The 20-year-old was pulled over in his car by the L.A. County Sheriff's deputy while driving in West Hollywood. The illicit drugs were found during a search of the vehicle.

Devoted dad: Robert Downey Jr. has placed his son in a Malibu rehab center. He says he  believes that Indio will conquer his addiction

The Iron Man star's son was booked in L.A. County jail and released early on Monday morning on $10,250 bail.

Downey has since issued a statement, thanking the police for their intervention, while expressing the belief that his son can be a 'recovery success story instead of a cautionary tale.'

According to sources, Indio is receiving treatment for drug addiction at Cliffside in Malibu.

Indio has been to rehab in the past but a family friend says they are hopeful the treatment he will receive at Cliffside will work.

'Bob not only knows about Indio's struggles, he's tried everything, as all parents do, including kicking Indio out of the family home, followed by boundaries and tough love. None has worked,' the friend explained.

'Cliffside may work because it's got an approach that Indio will hopefully not resist. Indio is his father's son. They both don't go for controlled orders about praying to a 'god' for help and the 12 steps, the way Downey sees it, is requiring you to believe in God, and though both Downeys may believe, they don't want it forced on them for sobriety purposes.

Cliffside uses a different model in it's attempts to help addicts recover that does not involve the 12 steps.

Billed as Malibu's exclusive alcohol rehabilitation program and drug rehab center, Cliffside says it teaches patients to 'Live the Life You Were Always Meant to Live'

Past celeb patients include Lindsey Lohan. The center offers 'cutting-edge, evidence-based, life-saving, holistic treatment in a luxury estate setting', run by 'industry leading professionals'.

Each patient is given a dedicated therapist 'helping you uncover the deep underlying issues that caused addiction in the first place, and healing your mind, body and spirit along the way'

'That's why Bob put Indio in Cliffside," says the friend. But, and there's a big 'but' here, Indio didn't go into rehab completely willingly.

'His dad's lawyers are insisting in hopes of a plea bargain when court time comes. This means that since Indio is not choosing to get clean on his own but is somewhat forced to, the sobriety may not stick.'

The friend added that Indio has been using drugs for eight years but hasn't been able to stay clean.

'Indio's been using drugs and hard drugs as well for eight years so there's been a million interventions and conversations and threats and AA meetings and sponsors. The list goes on.

In 2005, Indio appeared in his father's 2005 film 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' when he was 12-years-old

'None of it took, for the simple fact that Indio enjoys getting high and he found no compelling reason to not get high. It hasn't effected his health yet, and he's never going to find himself homeless, penniless and on the streets so the boy hasn't hit the preverbial 'bottom.'

'It's a tough road and Bob kicked Indio out of the house a few years ago, on the tough love principal, and that didn't work, either. So we'll see.'

After his son's arrest Downey issued a statement, thanking the police for their intervention, while expressing the belief that his son can be a 'recovery success story instead of a cautionary tale.''Unfortunately there’s a genetic component to addiction and Indio has likely inherited it.

'Also, there is a lot of family support and understanding, and we’re all determined to rally behind him and help him become the man he’s capable of being,' the 49-year-old actor said.

Indio is the son of Downey and his ex-wife Deborah Falconer, left, pictured in 2007. The couple split in 2001

But according to the family friend its now up to Indio to give rehab a go.

'Bob doesn't feel guilty. He knows Indio is doing this by choice.

'I can promise you that Bob is blessing those arresting officers because he knew that the only way to help his son at this late stage is for law enforcement to intervene and for Indio to get into the legal system.

'Bob also knows that if it takes jail time for Indio, so be it. Right now, Bob bailed him out, put him in a $45,000 a month rehab in the Malibu hills, and has given his son the leg up he needs to either make it or break it on his own. Now, it's up to Indio.' 

Downey's reps did not respond to requests for comment.
