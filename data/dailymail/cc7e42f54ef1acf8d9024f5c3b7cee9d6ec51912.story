The pilot of a holiday jet to Tenerife declared a Mayday emergency after one of its two engines failed at 35,000ft over the Atlantic.

The Jet2 flight from Glasgow was packed with families – including three babies and 47 children aged two to 16 – heading for sunshine breaks during the half-term school holiday.

The drama began as the Boeing 737-800 with 197 people on board – 191 passengers and six crew – was 30 minutes from its destination.

The pilot of a Jet2 flight from Glasgow to Tenerife declared a Mayday emergency after one of its two engines failed at 35,000ft

The airline confirmed to the Daily Mail that the pilot of the aircraft, registered G-GDFY, had issued a Mayday alert three-quarters of the way through the three and a half hour flight to the holiday isle on Monday after the engine failed.

It said there had been an 'engine oil pressure issue' which led to the 'controlled shutdown' of one engine as a 'precautionary measure' following a 'technical fault indication'.

The incident has been logged with UK and Spanish safety authorities, it said. As a UK registered plane, the pilot has to file an incident report within four days to the Civil Aviation Authority.

The drama on board flight LS155, which took off on Monday at 9am, happened just north of the Portuguese island of Madeira. The aircraft descended quickly by 10,000ft to 25,000ft to stabilise.

One insider said that in addition to the verbal Mayday the pilot had issued a 'Squawk 7700' digital alert code to warn air traffic controllers on their screens of the emergency.

'There were oil pressure warnings on the Number 1 engine which was subsequently shut down,' said the insider. 'The pilot issued a Squawk 7700 Mayday emergency warning to air traffic controllers.'

A spokesman for Jet2 said: 'Flight LS155 departed Glasgow on Monday morning at 9am local time.

'Around 30 minutes prior to landing in Tenerife passengers were informed there would be a controlled shutdown of one of the engines as a precautionary measure, due to a technical fault indication. The aircraft landed safely at 13.38.'

Jet2 said its aircraft are always within 60 minutes' flying time of an airport if flying on a single engine, adding: 'Flight Ops (operations) confirmed the pilot carried out a precautionary engine shutdown in line with Boeing procedures.'

Last week, angry Jet2 passengers said they were left to wait an hour in the cold at Manchester Airport after their Alicante flight was diverted there.

Holidaymakers returning from Spain on Thursday night described the scenes as 'total chaos'.

The flight was originally scheduled for Blackpool but Jet2 changed the destination after an announcement the airport would be closing when no buyer could be found.

Passenger Jackie Hughson said people, including those who were elderly and infirm, had to walk a long distance to the terminal, adding: 'People had to struggle on a long walk to get to where the coaches were supposed to be and there were no wheelchairs.'

Jet2 apologised for the disruption, adding: 'The Alicante flight was originally set to return to Blackpool Airport. However, restrictions in place at Blackpool meant we had to return to Manchester.'
