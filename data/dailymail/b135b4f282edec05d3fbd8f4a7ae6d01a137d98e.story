Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said today on 'Face the Nation' that the Republican Party 'clearly has to change' if it is to stand a chance of winning another presidential election in the future.

Despite his shock at Romney's defeat in November's general election, Gingrich blamed overly conservative policies as the reason why the party has failed to connect with minority groups and young people across the country.

'When I said as a candidate we're not going to deport a grandmother if she's been here 25 years, we had a nominee who said yes, we would, that she would self-deport,' Gingrich said. '

'I think at that point we lost Asians, we lost Latinos. You can't lose Asians, Latinos, African Americans and young people, and think you're going to be competitive.

'I think we have to come to grips with the reality.

'We have to learn to communicate in the world of young people on their terms but we also have to understand that we need to be a country of immigrants where Republicans are seen as welcoming, hard-working, competent people, not prepared to kick grandmother out.'

Gingrich, who lost to Mitt Romney in the GOP primaries explained his shock at the former Massachusetts Governor's loss to President Barack Obama.

Newt Gingrich appeared on the political show with Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn who echoed his sentiments

'I mean, maybe we could have won or not won this year,' said Gingrich.

'I was certainly wrong - I thought Romney would win up until about 5.30 on Election Day.'

Gingrich spoke about Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal's well received speech last week to the Republican National Committee in Charlotee.

Gingrich recommended 'to every Republican' Irving Kristol's 1976 essay, 'The Stupid Party.' Then 'Ronald Reagan came along with Jack Kemp,' Gingrich continued, 'and they basically moved us back to being an idea-oriented party. I think we clearly have to change.'

Appearing alongside Gingrich this morning was Republican and Tennessee Representative Marsha Blackburn, who said that Jindal was 'right on track' with his modernisation comments in North Carolina.

'What we need to do is get rid of 'Grand Old Party.' We are the 'great opportunity party.' said Blackburn.

'We're the 'growth and opportunity party.' We are the 'government of the people' party.

'And that needs to be upon point of view and the perspective we come from and we carry our message forth.'

Last week, Bobby Jindal called on the Republican Party to 'stop being the stupid party' on Thursday as GOP leaders promised fundamental changes to help stave off future losses.

In the keynote address at the Republican National Committee’s winter meeting, Jindal said the GOP doesn’t need to change its values but “might need to change just about everything else we are doing.”

'We’ve got to stop being the stupid party. It’s time for a new Republican Party that talks like adults,' he said. 'We had a number of Republicans damage the brand this year with offensive and bizarre comments. I’m here to say we’ve had enough of that.'

Jindal, thought to be a potential 2016 presidential contender, offered little detail in the 25-minute address.

He called on conservatives to shift their focus from Capitol Hill number crunching to 'the place where conservatism thrives — in the real world beyond the Washington Beltway.'

Hours before the speech, Republican leaders promised to release in March a report, dubbed the 'Growth and Opportunity Project,' outlining recommendations on party rules and messaging designed to appeal to a rapidly changing American electorate.

President Barack Obama’s November victory was fueled, in part, by overwhelming support from the nation’s Hispanic, Asian and African-American communities.

Republicans presidential nominee Mitt Romney struggled last fall to win over women and minorities, who overwhelmingly favored President Barack Obama’s re-election bid.

GOP officials conceded this week that they must change their tone and message, if not their policies, if they hope to expand their appeal in the coming years.

Romney alienated many Hispanic voters by highlighting his support for a fence along the Mexican border and “self-deportation” of illegal immigrants.

Down-ticket Republican candidates alienated female voters by backing new abortion laws in a handful of swing states like Virginia and New Hampshire, while Senate candidate Todd Akin of Missouri hurt himself and his party by declaring that women’s bodies could prevent pregnancy in cases of 'legitimate rape.'

In the keynote address at the Republican National Committee¿s winter meeting, Jindal said the GOP doesn¿t need to change its values but 'might need to change just about everything else we are doing.'

GOP strategist Ari Fleischer suggested that his party could learn an important lesson from Democrats on messaging: 'Republicans talk policy and Democrats talk people. Republicans can learn a little bit from Democrats on how to make those people connections with our policies.'

Asked whether he was considering a presidential bid in 2016, Jindal brushed aside the question. 'Any Republican that’s thinking about talking about running for president in 2016 needs to get his head examined,' he said. 'We’ve got a lot of work to do.'

Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., told reporters on the sidelines of the meeting Thursday that Republicans also need to develop a sound strategy for confronting the Obama administration, suggesting House Republicans could use hearings to expose waste and promote better ideas.

'A lot of Republicans, frankly, spent the last two years saying, ‘Oh, gee, we don’t have to do much because after Obama loses we’ll work with the new Republican president.’ Well, that world ain’t there,' Gingrich said. “So now they have to make adjustments. They’ve got to understand that this is a different game.'
