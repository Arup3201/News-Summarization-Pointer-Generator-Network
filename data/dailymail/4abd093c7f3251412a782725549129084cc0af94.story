Every man, woman and child should be regularly weighed to halt ‘skyrocketing’ levels of obesity, experts believe.

The National Obesity Forum has warned that the spiralling cost of treating obesity could ‘break the NHS’ – and the threat is magnified by people being blind to their size.

To millions of Britons, being dangerously overweight is now simply normal.

Fear: The National Obesity Forum has warned that the spiralling cost of treating obesity could ‘break the NHS’ – and the threat is magnified by people being blind to their size

In its annual report, the forum calls for regular monitoring of the weight of all adults. And it wants all young children to be weighed annually.

Regularly logging measurements would allow doctors to spot those whose weight is creeping up – and catch them before they become dangerously fat.

With obesity costing the UK almost £45billion a year, and Hungary the only European country to have a bigger obesity problem than Britain, the NOF says we have now reached a ‘critical point’.

The State of the Nation’s Waistlines 2015 report paints a bleak picture of Britain’s obesity battle.

Obesity levels have doubled in the last two decades and today 67 per cent of men overweight or obese. Women are not far behind, with fewer than half a normal, healthy weight.

The forum warns the problem is more serious still among children.

Figures published in December and described a tragedy by the chief executive of Public Health England, show that 22.5 per cent of boys and girls are overweight or obese at the age of four or five.

By the time they reach 10 or 11, the figure is 33.5 per cent.

Children are weighed on starting primary school and again on leaving – but the National Obesity Forum says annual weigh-in are essential if weight gain is to be caught early and nipped in the bud.

Spokesman Tam Fry  says the current system has provided lots of data about childhood obesity – but the long gap between measurements means it has done nothing for individual children.

The National Obesity Forum wants people's weights to be monitored to cut the cost of obesity on the NHS

Mr Fry, who is also honorary chairman of the Child Growth Foundation, said: ‘If a child is weighed aged four and not weighed again until they are ten, you have got six years where that child is putting on weight.

‘A good proportion of our children are getting fatter and fatter.’

Mr Fry also wants GPs to routinely weigh all their adult patients.

The sheer numbers involved mean annual weigh-ins would not be practical but it may be possible to put each patient on the scales every three years.

Currently, weigh-ins are done on an ad-hoc basis.

Women who are on the pill, people who need repeat prescriptions of certain drugs, those having heart check-ups are among those who will be put on the scales but there is no systematic plan in place. As a result, some patients can go years without their weight being recorded by their family doctor.

Other said that while tracking weight gain is important, it isn’t necessarily a job for GPs. For instance, it could be done by practice nurses or by community slimming clubs.

The problem is compounded by many people being blind to their weight problem.

A ComRes poll found that only 6 per cent of Britons consider themselves to be obese – despite the true figure being around 25 per cent.

Dame Sally Davies, the Chief Medical Officer, has warned that millions of Britons do not realise they are overweight because it is now seen as being normal.

She said that high street shops are exacerbating the problem by altering size labels to make shoppers think they are thinner than they actually are.

Today’s report also calls for routine weighing of pregnant women, clearer labelling of food and highlights the growing price gap between healthy and unhealthy foods.

The NOF also warns that without extra training for GPs on how to broach the subject of obesity and better access to specialist weight loss services, a new national anti-obesity drive could fail.

Announced last month, it will involve GPs identifying patients whose weight puts them at risk of diabetes.

Professor David Haslam, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘Obesity levels have skyrocketed in the last 20 years and as a country we need to do more.

‘We should be under no illusions.

‘Obesity represents one of the most serious threats to the health of the UK population and has the potential of breaking the NHS.’

Last night, Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, said: ‘Rising obesity is the fastest growing health threat facing us as individuals and as a nation.

‘So the NHS, schools, parents, employers and the food industry now need to get our collective act together.’

He added that new focus on people at risk of diabetes will be ‘ground-breaking’.
