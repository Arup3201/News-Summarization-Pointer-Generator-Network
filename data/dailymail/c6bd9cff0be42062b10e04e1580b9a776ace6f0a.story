A teenager killed his ex-girlfriend by strangling her and watching his friend stuff a sock down her throat before they tied her body to cinder blocks and dumped it in a river, authorities have said.

Je'Michael Malloy, 17, allegedly had help from his 18-year-old friend, Dominic Lock, in the grisly murder of his former girlfriend, Danielle Locklear, 15, in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

The teenage boys, who appeared in court on Wednesday, were arrested on Tuesday after Malloy allegedly confessed to strangling Danielle and dumping her body.

Lock was initially charged with conspiracy for allegedly helping 
carry Locklear's body, but this has now been dropped and he has instead been charged with second-degree murder, WRAL reported.

'Accomplice': Dominic Lock, pictured in court on Tuesday, allegedly shoved a sock in the victim's mouth

Authorities say he was the one who shoved the sock down the girl's throat.

A massive search was launched for Danielle after she vanished on March 11 and her body was found in the South River by searchers on April 3.

Before then, Malloy had feigned concern about his ex-girlfriend, offering her family help, looking for her and 'liking' a Facebook group set up as part of the search.

But authorities say he killed her after they got into an argument when she went to visit him. She was allegedly murdered and her body was dumped in the river that night.

Shocking: When Danielle went missing, Malloy feigned concern and helped her family search for her

Both teenagers now face charges of second-degree murder.

Danielle's heartbroken family and friends attended the teenagers' hearing and wept as they said they would get justice for the South View High School freshman.

Her aunt, Chena Simmons, told WRAL that the family was shocked when Malloy was arrested because he 'seemed like such a nice young man' and attended the same church as the family.

'That's another thing that's so devastating to us â€“ that he could just stand there with us, asking "Is everything OK? Do you all feel OK?"' Simmons said.

The former couple had been vocal about their relationship on Facebook, the FayObserver reported.

Last August, Danielle wrote on Malloy's page: 'Truth is you're the best boyfriend ever, and any girl should be so lucky to have
 someone so thoughtful, sweet and strong. I'm so lucky you're mine.'

But in December, she wrote on her profile: 'i feel no love because some people are too busy with other friends to pay attention to there (sic) girlfriend. Christmas is supposed to be a happy time ... i feel like poo.'

By Valentine's Day - a month before her death - things were back on track as she posted messages he's texted her and called him 'my sweet baby.'

Both of the teenagers are in jail on a $100,000 bond.
