Selling Smart cars - the tiny German 'microcars' popular in Europe has always been a tough job in the U.S.

So Smart is set to unveil the first Smart pickup concept - titled the Smart For-U.S. 

It will celebrate what Smart calls 'its world premiere' at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, 14 - 22 January 2012.

The new Smart car is a pickup truck aimed squarely at the U.S. market - armed with an electric-bike charging station on the back, and a smartphone instead of a rear-view mirror

Smart says the concept is so small it could actually be loaded into the loading area of a normal American pickup truck.

It's just 12 feet long and 5ft high - and it wears its hi-tech heart on its sleeve.

In place of a conventional rear-view mirror the smart for-us features
a smartphone accommodated in a holder on top of the instrument panel 
support.

The driver can see what is happening on the road behind with the help of an integrated video camera.

Two e-bikes will sit in the back, and the loading area is all-electric too - though whether the vehicle's 12ft length will appeal to Americans remains to be seen

It's also unlikely to match the roar of the average pickup truck - it has a state-of-the-art electric drive with a55 kW magneto-electric motor the zero-emission smart for-us is agile and lively to drive.

Smart CEO Dr. Annette Winkler says 'We at smart love pick-ups – if they are small on the outside, large on the inside, very safe and extremely comfortable. With the smart for-us a petrol station is no longer required!'

Obviously, plenty of power sockets will be.Not only does the two-seater run entirely electrically, it also sports a docking station for two e-bikes, and you charge them up as it drives - so you can jump off for yet more environmentally friendly transport once you park up.

Naturally, the cargo area is all-electric, too. 'When it opens first of all the cargo floor including tailboard retracts by one foot, then the tailgate slides down in a parallel position. The cargo on the 3ft cargo area is then extremely easy to access,' says Winkler.
