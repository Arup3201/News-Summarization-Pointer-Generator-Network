In a lengthy profile of Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, the U.S. spy chief said it would be impossible to prevent intelligence leaks like those perpetrated by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and former Army intelligence analyst Bradley Manning, who has changed his name to Chelsea now that he is imprisoned after being convicted of espionage.

In the profile, Clapper explains that the size of the intelligence community makes it virtually impossible to guarantee that leaks like those of Snowden and Manning won't happen again.

'In the end,' Clapper says, 'we will never ever be able to guarantee that 
there will not be an Edward Snowden or another Chelsea Manning because 
this is a large enterprise composed of human beings with all their 
idiosyncrasies.'

Tough job: Clapper says that despite the safeguards, there is no way to guarantee people won't leak classified information

The profile was written by long-time national security journalist Eli Lake and published on the Daily Beast website.

Lake describes Clapper's job as 'the worst job in Washington' due in part to the great responsibility that comes with being the person responsible for gathering the information that's used to keep the country safe from enemies.

Gathering intelligence within the perimeters of the Constitution can present challenges for those in charge of gathering it - and balancing the duty of keeping people safe with individual privacy continues to be a difficult task for the U.S. intelligence community.

Adding to the difficulty for Clapper is the fact that annual intelligence budgets are being cut for the first time since the job of Direct of National Intelligence was created in 2005 in response to suggestions made in the 9/11 Commission, which found that intelligence agencies like the CIA and FBI weren't communicating with each other, which led to major lapses in national security.

Snowden: Clapper says he can't understand what motivates a fellow intelligence officer like Snowden to leak damaging information

According to Lake's profile, though, the biggest problem Clapper has continues to be Snowden, and the troves of information he turned over to journalists at the Washington Post, the Guardian and other news outlets - as well as information that he hasn't released, which could fall into the hands of the Russians or the Chinese.

Currently, Snowden is in temporary asylum in Russia.

According to Lake, the U.S. government still doesn't know 'the full extent of what Snowden revealed or whether more documents that have yet to be published in the press have made their way into the hands of Russian or Chinese intelligence agencies.'

What's troubling for Clapper is the fact that the information Snowden leaked to the media came from a database designed to share intelligence amongst agencies within the government - which has been the primary mission of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence since it was created at the suggestion of the 9/11 Commission. 

Lake explains that the job of the ODNI has been to 'transform the intelligence community’s “need to know” culture to one of “need to share.”'

'Traitor': Bradley Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking classified information to Wikileaks

It was those changes, Lake says, that allowed Snowden and Manning to exploit the new system to leak classified information.

As for Snowden, Clapper has a hard time grasping why he - as a fellow intelligence officer charged with keeping Americans safe - would do what he did.

'Maybe if I had I’d understand him better because I have trouble 
understanding what he did or what he’d do,' the director said. 'From my 
standpoint, the damage he’s done. I could almost accept it or understand
 it if this were simply about his concerns about so-called domestic 
surveillance programs. But what he did, what he took, what he has 
exposed, goes way, way, way beyond the so-called domestic surveillance 
programs.” 

As an intelligence profession, Clapper says 'it’s gut 
wrenching for me to see so much of this so casually exposed. It’s terrible.'
