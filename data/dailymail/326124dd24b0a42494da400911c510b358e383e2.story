A prominent Republican woman launched a she-said, she-said battle over wages on Wednesday morning by accusing the White House of paying women less than men – just hours after President Barack Obama begged Congress to outlaw the practice.

High-stakes gender politics made an appearance in Tuesday's State of the Union address when the president insisted that 'Congress still needs to pass a law that makes sure a woman is paid the same as a man for doing the same work.'

'Really,' he said to cheers from Democrats on Capitol HIll. 'It’s 2015. It’s time.'

On Wednesday morning former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina claimed 'the president hasn't really led in this regard. He's not paying women equally by his own measures in his own White House.'

President Barack Obama made a point of mentioning pay equity for women in his State of the Union speech, a political dog-whistle that motivates Democratic voters but is subject to widely varying interpretation

The line brought applause from Democrats but not much enthusiasm from Republicans, who 'won't stand – literally – for pay equity,' according to some wags on Twitter

Fiorina, herself a potential 2016 presidential candidate, glossed over details from the administration's annual Report to Congress on White House Staff that show women are paid equally for the same work but aren't trusted with as many high-level jobs.

She aired her complaint on MSNBC's Morning Joe program, where she faced off against top Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett.

'Every woman across the nation agrees that equal pay for equal work is absolutely required,' Fiorina said. 'I also think it's just a fact that laws exist on the books today, and if a woman is being discriminated against because of her gender, she should use the full extent of that law.'

Jarrett fired back.

'Let's unpack your question a little bit. ... In the White House women do earn equal pay for equal work,' she said.

Obama's salary data show that male white-collar White House employees earn an average of about $88,600, compared with $78,400 for females. That 13 per cent wage gap is in line with the federal government as a whole, according to the Office of Personnel Management.

But it's larger than the overall gap in the District of Columbia, which the Washington Post reports is 9.9 per cent.

Nationally, women in the U.S. earn 23.5 per cent less than men.

That number, like the White House's, results in large part from women holding more junior-level jobs with lower salaries. 

Fewer men take time away from their careers to raise children, giving them access to continued career advancement and salary growth. And some researchers point to trends in women's employment that suggest many mothers accept lower wages in exchange for better health benefits and greater flexibility in working hours. 

That may be one reason why 87 men in the White House earn six-figure salaries, something only 53 women on Obama's staff can say.compared to 53 female White House officials. 

The White House's 2014 report also showed that there are two more men than women in the highest-ranking positions.

Fiorina's spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

But the longtime tech executive, who ran an unsuccessful bid for a California U.S> Senate seat in 2012, hinted during the on-air tussle that her real target was labor unions and their preference for seniority-based pay systems.

'The single greatest impediment to equal pay for equal work is this seniority system, which pays not on merit, not on performance, but on time and grade,' she claimed.

'And who is it who supports the seniority system? Unions, government bureaucracies, the vast majority of constituencies that the Democratic party represents and who support the Democratic party.'

Paying women 'by merit and by their results,' Fiorina insisted, would result in a system where 'women will be paid equally.' 

Fiorina, a onetime US Senate candidate in California, now lives in Virginia and is weighing a presidential run in 2016

Jarrett is among the Obamas' oldest friends from their Chicago days, and is seen in Washington as a political 'fixer' who has the president's ear more often than his Cabinet secretaries

Jarrett fired back that Obama's State of the Union barb about pay equity was a reference to the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill that Republicans have consistently blocked since 2009. 

The National Women's Law Center supports the measure, saying it would allow judges to take a close look at companies' pay practices to be sure any gender disparities 'serve a legitimate business purpose' and spring from 'factors other than sex.'

Business advocates and their Republican supporters, however, maintain that there is a broad list of reasons why some women earn less than some men.

In 2009 the U.S. Department of Labor commissioned a study from the CONSAD Research Corporation that counseled the government on how to interpret wage data from the U.S. Census and other sources.

It found that 'differences in the compensation of men and women are the result of a multitude of factors.'

'The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers,' the report concluded. 

The Equal Pay Act Of 1963 already makes it illegal to pay women less than men for performing the same job in the same company.
