Iago Aspas failed to net a single goal in the Premier League last season but the Liverpool misfit scored a four-minute hat-trick for Sevilla in the Copa del Rey on Wednesday night.

The La Liga side won 5-1 against second-tier Sabadell to complete an 11-2 aggregate score and Aspas found the net three times in a matter of moments in the second half.

The 27-year-old, who is currently on loan from Brendan Rodgers' side, also scored a treble in the first leg of the round of 32 clash to take his tally for the tie to six.

Liverpool have struggled for goals this season after losing top scorer Luis Suarez in the summer, before Daniel Sturridge was struck down by injury.

And Aspas's goalscoring exploits may just have Liverpool boss Rodgers checking the Spaniard's contract for a recall option.

Barcelona player Gerard Deulofeu, who spent last season on loan at Everton, also got his name on the scoresheet as Sevilla progressed to the last 16.
