Professional gardener Joe Hashman (pictured outside the tribunal in Southampton) claims he was sacked from a Dorset garden centre because of his anti-fox hunting beliefs

A garden centre worker who was sacked for his anti-fox hunting belief has won a five-figure pay-out.

Joe Hashman, who has been an active animal rights campaigner for 30 years, was handed his P45 at Orchard Park Farm near Gillingham, Dorset, in September 2009, and he has been seeking justice ever since.

Over two years later the 43-year-old has now succeeded in the landmark discrimination case which could pave the way for others to sue their former employers, if they have suffered in the work place because of their personal views.

Mr Hashman had been looking for £50,000 for loss of earnings and injury to feelings from Orchard Park Farm garden centre.

The managers sacked him two days after his covert filming had helped to convict the celebrity chef Clarissa Dickson Wright of illegal hare coursing.

He agreed an undisclosed settlement, believed to include a five figure payout, after a panel at Southampton Employment Tribunal ruled in his favour.

As part of it, Orchard Park's directors issued a public apology to Mr Hashman, accepting that he had never sought to mislead them about his animal welfare activism.

Married father-of-two Mr Hashman, of Shaftesbury, Dorset, successfully argued that his views on fox hunting should be placed on the same legal footing as religious beliefs.

It was accepted that his concern about the environment, animal rights, veganism and, in particular, his opposition to fox hunting, amount to a philosophical belief under the Employment Equality (Religion and Belief) Regulations 2003.

Mr Hashman's solicitor Shah Qureshi, of law firm Bindmans, said: 'This is clearly a very positive tribunal decision for those who believe in animal rights.

Mr Hashman claimed he felt less secure in his job after learning that the owners of Orchard Park Garden Centre (pictured) had a pro-hunting farm manager

'This judgment vindicates Joe's decision to bring this case and fight for justice after he lost his livelihood. It is a welcome conclusion to a long-running saga.

'The judgment sends a signal to employers that discriminating against someone because of their deeply held beliefs is unacceptable and unlawful.'

Mr Hashman said: 'I am proud to have established in law my philosophical belief in the sanctity of life, including fervent anti-fox hunting and hare coursing beliefs.

'The tribunal found that I was discriminated against because of these beliefs and so I feel vindicated in taking my case to them for judgment.

'I don't think anyone should be discriminated against at work because of their views on issues such as hunting.

'Politics and morality as to how we live our lives should not be brought into the workplace.'

Giving evidence, professional gardener Mr Hashman told the tribunal how he lost his job when his bosses found out he was a leading saboteur and animal welfare activist - and had been since the age of 14. 

Mr Hashman said he was 'picked on' and suddenly sacked after he appeared on Radio 2's Jeremy Vine Show, explaining his part in Dickson's Wright's court case.

He said: 'I believe now that my involvement in relation to hunting issues and ultimately my philosophical belief was the reason for my dismissal.

'On September 1, 2009 there were two convictions at Scarborough magistrates' court under the Hunting Act, which I was directly responsible for.

'I believe that those connected with Orchard Park knew, or came to know, of some or all of these matters at some point leading up to my dismissal.'

Orchard Park Farm had claimed that it only dismissed Mr Hashman because his vegetable patch at the garden centre, designed to encourage customers to grow more produce, was not making enough money.

But after losing the case, the directors apologised for a memo that was circulated at Orchard Park in November 2010 criticising Mr Hashman.

They said: 'We, the directors of Orchard Park, unreservedly apologise to Mr Hashman for any injury to his feelings arising from the memo.

'In particular, we accept that Mr Hashman did not seek to mislead us or set us up in relation to his animal welfare beliefs and actions.

'Equally, we did not intend to suggest that Mr Hashman engaged in any bullying or mud-slinging. We wish Mr Hashman well for the future.'
