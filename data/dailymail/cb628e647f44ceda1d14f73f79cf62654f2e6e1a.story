A controversial scheme to give new mothers vouchers to breastfeed will not be rolled out nationwide, Nick Clegg said today.

A pilot study in Sheffield, his home city, will see mothers receive £200 in shopping vouchers if they feed their babies breast milk for up to six months.

But the Deputy Prime Minister insisted it is not going to become government policy to pay people to breastfeed.

Shelved: Poundland vouchers are being given to some new mothers to persuade them to breastfeed, bu it will not be rolled out nationally

A feasibility study has begun aimed at increasing rates of breastfeeding in an area where it is very low, and it was suggested if successful it could be rolled out nationwide.

Critics rounded on the scheme saying money was not the way to increase take-up of breastfeeding, and the scheme would penalise women who were unable to do so.

But Mr Clegg said on his weekly radio phone-in on LBC 97.3 said: ‘It’s not going to be Government policy to say we’re going to pay people.’

Mr Clegg added: ‘We’re not going to start paying people for that. But I do want to do everything we can in Government to change the environment such that all women who want to breastfeed feel that they are supported and that they are free to do so. Women who can’t or don’t want to are of course free to take that choice.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted the idea of paying people to breastfeed was not government policy

While he said it was not something government should pay for, he added: ‘But am I going to say the academics and others who are looking into this somehow should stop doing that study? No’.

He was asked by a caller what he thought of the pilot, unveiled by academics at Sheffield University earlier this week, and also about evidence for the health benefits of breastfeeding.

One recent study estimated that breastfeeding saves the National Health Service at least £40million a year by preventing respiratory and gastrointestinal problems and reducing breast cancer.

Mr Clegg told the caller, Sonia: ‘I hadn’t heard that figure that if you could get more mums breastfeeding that would make a massive saving for the NHS, probably be good for their sons and daughters too.

‘But I have to stress there are some women who can’t breastfeed and they shouldn’t feel in any way guilty about that.

‘It’s all about making their choices available to them. If you can and if you want to you should feel free and empowered and happy to do so.’

But he said the topic did need to be addressed, adding: ‘This is a research study about what to do with those mothers who are the hardest to reach, who are the hardest to persuade, to take that step of breastfeeding in the first place.

‘Compared to other countries, we have lower rates of breastfeeding and the health effects on children do suggest breastfeeding can be very helpful’.

Around 130 mothers in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire, including his Sheffield Hallam constituency will get shopping vouchers for Matalan, John Lewis, Mothercare or supermarkets worth £120 if their babies receive breast milk until they are six weeks old, and a further £80 if their babies are still breastfed at six months.

The initiative will not be rigorously policed and will simply require the participating mother and their health visitor or midwife to sign off to say they are breastfeeding.

Formula: Research reveals 34 per cent of British women feed their babies milk formula for the first six months

The Department of Health is funding the project but health minister Dr Dan Poulter stressed that he did not believe ‘financial incentives’ were the best way to encourage mothers to do it.

Dr Clare Relton, senior research fellow at the University of Sheffield said only 34pc of UK babies are breastfed at six month months, and only 1pc breastfed exclusively at that stage.

She said: ‘Breast milk is perfectly designed for babies and provides all they need for the first six months of their life.

‘The scheme offers vouchers to mothers who breastfeed as a way of acknowledging both the value of breastfeeding to babies, mothers and society, and the effort involved in breastfeeding.
