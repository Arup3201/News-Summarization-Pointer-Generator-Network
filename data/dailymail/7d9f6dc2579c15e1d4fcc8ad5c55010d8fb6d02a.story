For a split second Costa Rica manager Jorge Luis Pinto paused, arms mid air, and then erupted as his side were denied a stonewall penalty against Italy.

Striker Joel Campbell had raced behind the Italian defence in the 43rd minute before being clumsily brought down by Giorgio Chiellini.Â 

There seemed no doubt that referee Enrique Osses of Chile would award a penalty and Pinto, gesticulating on the touchline, thought as much as well.

A second later, however, his anger turned into a full blown, arm-waving rage as he realised that Osses had not awarded a spot kick.

Pinto, who had edged right before realising the fourth official was to his left, then preceded to manically wave his arms and charge at the referee's assistant to vent his anger, with Costa Rica's staff and substitutes following his lead.

Their anger was well founded with Sportsmail's Graham Poll - a former World Cup referee - tweeting: 'HUGE moment in this match, how have Costa Rica not got a penalty?! Joel Campbell gets behind the Italy defence to race through on goal, before he is clumsily brought down by a push from Giorgio Chiellini.'

Fortunately for Pinto and Costa Rica, justice was done minutes later when Fulham's Bryan Ruiz headed them in front. Costa Rica managed to hold out to win 1-0 and sending England crashing out of the World Cup and the group stage.
