Computer hacker Gary McKinnon is challenging a U.S. bid to extradite him on charges of hacking into highly sensitive military computers

Gary McKinnon
should not be protected from extradition – but asylum seekers must get 
fresh safeguards, a ‘whitewash’ inquiry has concluded.

It said a treaty between the UK and 
the U.S. was not ‘lopsided’ and did not need changing to stop British 
citizens being unfairly bundled on a plane to America.

And it rejected calls for new rules 
blocking transfer to a foreign country when the alleged offence took 
place largely in Britain – as in the case of computer hacker Mr 
McKinnon.

But it did call for a new law to offer greater protection to those claiming asylum.

The panel recommended that anybody 
claiming refugee status – whether they lodge their claim before or after
the extradition process begins – be saved from being sent overseas 
until the asylum case is closed.

It means a foreign national claiming asylum has better protection than a British citizen.

Campaigners called for David Cameron 
and Nick Clegg – who personally called the 2003 Extradition Act 
‘lopsided’ – to throw the report straight in the dustbin.

Politicians are not bound by the panel’s findings and are free to begin efforts to renegotiate arrangements with the U.S.

Mr McKinnon’s mother, Janis Sharp, 
attacked the £250,000 report, which took a year to prepare, as a 
shameful ‘whitewash’. She told the Daily Mail: ‘This is a missed 
opportunity for British citizens to be shown that they matter and aren’t
just being thrown to the dogs.

‘What message does it send to the 
world when the British Government doesn’t even care enough about its own
people to give them the same protection as other countries give 
theirs?’

The independent panel, headed by Sir 
Scott Baker, was set up by the Coalition to investigate whether the 
treaty should be changed.

Its recommendations contradict the 
findings of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which called for the 
Government to renegotiate the treaty to make it balanced.

The U.S. requires ‘sufficient 
evidence to establish probable cause’ before agreeing to extradite 
anyone to the UK, but Britons going in the opposite direction are not 
afforded the same protection.

Instead of strengthening the powers 
of the Home Secretary to stop unjust extradition cases, the panel said 
she should have reduced responsibilities for determining human rights 
appeals.

Theresa May is reconsidering Mr McKinnon’s case on the grounds 
that he has Asperger’s and could take his own life if extradited. If the
recommendations were enacted, she would lose such responsibility.

Mr McKinnon hacked into U.S. military
computers from the bedroom of his north London flat. On his case, the 
panel said: ‘We have no evidence that any injustice is being caused by 
the present arrangements.’

Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘As the 
Joint Committee on Human Rights highlighted, the operation of the Human 
Rights Act means that in practice many innocent British citizens subject
to extradition have lower human rights safeguards compared to foreign 
national criminals we are trying to deport. Those double standards 
corrode public confidence in the justice system.’

A spokesman for the Prime Minister said: ‘We will set out our response in due course.’

In a second controversial decision,
the European Arrest Warrant was declared to be working ‘reasonably 
well’. The EAW requires countries to send criminal suspects to the 
nation requesting their arrest.

But there are concerns that it has led to innocent Britons being bundled on to planes with very flimsy evidence against them.
