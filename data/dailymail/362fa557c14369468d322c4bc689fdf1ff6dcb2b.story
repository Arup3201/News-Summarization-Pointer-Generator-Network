Barbara Walters is being courted by CNN and other networks just days after retiring from ABC.

The news legend, 84, only left ABC on Friday following her last star-studded episode of The View, with guests including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Oprah Winfrey.

Sources have told MailOnline that the Queen of broadcasting is being pursued by CNN, while another said: 'Barbara's retirement seems to mean nothing - she's been taking meetings all over town.'

Queens of daytime: Oprah Winfrey told how when she was first started out in TV she got over her nerves by just pretending to act like Barbara Walters

Emotional moment: The closest Barbara Walters came to crying during her farewell show on The View on Friday was when Oprah Winfrey sang her praises and said that she was an inspiration. She is being pursued by news networks now - despite her retirement from ABC

After her emotional exit from the show she created, Barbara told US Weekly she planned to take a break over the summer - but admitted she was already thinking about new TV projects.

She said: 'Monday comes, and I'm going to sleep late! A little later on I'm going to go to Europe for a few days with a friend because I don't want to sit home and think about, 'What do I do today? Why aren't I on the air?' So I'm going to go away for a bit. And then it's the summer!''

While she wants to slow down, the presenter hopes to interview more high profile people in the future.

She said: ''I would love to do an interview with the Pope. I do my homework, so I have a certain sense of authority. Sometimes I know more about the person than they do themselves. I'm very rarely nervous. When I finish an interview, I do 'shoulda, coulda, woulda,' and it drives me crazy, but when I'm actually doing the interview, I'm fine in authority and that's a good feeling.'

A TV source added: 'Barbara has been working for more than five decades and she will be a journalist till her dying day, there's no way she's going to sit at home knitting.

'She has let it be known she wants to continue working on projects.'

CNN recently axed Brit host Piers Morgan's prime-time show - he was brought in to replace veteran interviewer Larry King.

When asked about discussions with CNN, a source close to Barbara today said there was 'no truth' in the rumours, while an ABC source said Barbara remained tied to the network and would still appear on ABC news while executive producing The View.

On Friday, Barbara was treated to a sensational farewell on The View0 as Oprah Winfrey surprised her and said: 'You're the reason I wanted to be in television. Like everyone else, I want to thank you for being a pioneer and everything that that word means.

'You
 shattered the glass ceiling for so many women,' said Oprah, who then 
brought on a startling parade of female broadcasters including Diane Sawyer, Katie Couric, Robin Roberts, Gayle King, 
Connie Chung and Joan Lunden.

'You are my legacy,' Barbara said to them as they crowded around her onstage.

Oprah went on to talk about how Barbara had the 'courage' to become the first female co-anchor in spite of widespread criticism and the fact that her co-host Hugh Downs openly disliked the fact that he had to share the camera with a woman.

Those who followed: Oprah Winfrey took a roll call of the dozens of female broadcasters who came after Barbara  Winfrey was the first woman to have a co-anchor position on television news

Familiar faces: Katie Couric, Savannah Guthrie, Natalie Morales, Tamron Hall, Maria Shriver and Cynthia McFadden were among the women who went to The View set to thank Walters for her inspiration

'Retired': Last month, the celebrated newswoman received a star-studded farewell from The View, with guests including former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Oprah Winfrey

Barbara said that she will remain an executive producer of The View, the morning talk show she created nearly 18 years ago, but has no specific plans for what she will do now.

During her farewell show, she turned to Hillary Clinton for tips on what to do when taking time off - and was told to take a real vacation that lasts 'at least a week'.

'You're in no position to tell me to take time off!' Barbara joked.

'You
 have a wealth of friends who adore you spend time with them,' the 
former Secretary of State and likely 2016 Democratic presidential nominee 
told Walters.

Mrs Clinton added: 'I can't 
believe this day has come, and I can't believe it's for real.'

Barbara began her career on NBC's 'Today' in 1962, then came 
to ABC in 1976, where her many duties ranged from co-anchoring '20/20' 
to hosting scores of specials as well as 'The View.'

Typically,
 Walters couldn't let Clinton get away without fielding the question on 
so many minds: Is she running for president in 2016?

'I am running,' smiled Clinton. 'Around the park.'
