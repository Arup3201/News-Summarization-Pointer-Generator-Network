It's certainly traditional, if rather miserable. The bank holiday weekend got off to a soggy start yesterday as the Met Office said this spring will be the coldest for more than 30 years.

The unsettled weather will put a dampener on Bank Holiday Monday and looks set to continue into next week as schoolchildren enjoy their summer half-term break.

Temperatures sank as low as 7C (45F) yesterday as severe weather warnings were issued in parts of the country.

Undeterred: Traffic was starting to build on the A14 near a rainy cambridge at the start of the Bank Holiday getaway

The days ahead: Don't forget to bring an umbrella on your Bank Holiday trip

Meanwhile high winds swept from the South West up to Yorkshire, making it feel even colder.

The
Met Office now believes this spring will be the coldest since 1979, 
with the mean UK temperature estimated at 6.1C (43F), well below the 
long-term average for this time of year of 7.7C (46F).

Forecaster John Lee of MeteoGroup said: ‘We have got a low pressure system, which is spreading from the North Sea.

‘That’s
what’s bringing these showers and keeping the skies pretty cloudy. It’s
also got some quite brisk winds, so all of those areas in the South and
South East are feeling quite chilly.’

But
hardy Britons refused to be deterred by the grim conditions, with 
millions taking to the roads yesterday to make the most of the getaway, 
as supermarkets stocked up on barbecue food.

And
there is reason to be optimistic. Forecasters said the weather could 
improve over the weekend.

Under their umbrellas: These two women protected themselves from the rain today on Brighton seafront

Bad for business: Punt operator Niall Folbigg had little to do today but sit and hope for the rain to clear from the River Cam in Cambridge today

Washout: Punt operators on the River Cam hoping for a sunny start to the long weekend were left disappointed today

Lovely weather for ducks: Some characters spotted along the River Cam won't have minded the downpours

No sign of summer: Tourists and shoppers in Cambridge sought protection from the lashing rain under plastic macs and umbrellas

Severe conditions: The Highways Agency warned drivers on UK roads as gales swept the country today

Grey day: Highways officials were still anticipating waves of traffic heading towards the coast despite the wet, windy weather

Bank Holiday tradition: Queues of cars heading south snaked along the motorway near Weston-super-Mare in Somerset today

Bizarre: It may be May, but a reindeer calf born in Scotland has taken its first faltering steps in snow instead of on lush spring grass

Wintry scene: The reindeer seen today was born during a snowstorm in the Cairngorms this week

Ominous: Blooming apple trees look spring like near Glastonbury, Somerset, but the grey skies were evidence of the dismal start to the Bank Holiday

Flourishing despite the cold: Apple tree blossom creates a pretty picture at orchards in Dorset today, but cider makers still need some warmer weather to ensure the trees bear fruit

Bumper crop: It may have been a poor start to the spring, but Somerset cider makers are celebrating a blooming start to the apple growing season

Better late than never: The blossom has arrived two weeks late this year - but cider-makers say it is bigger and better than they had hoped

Spring awakening: The floral display at the Somerset orchard is the best in a decade, growers say

Today much of the country will experience 
sunny intervals, with temperatures reaching 14C (57F) and highs of 18C 
(64F) in London.

‘Today will see a much better day with sunny spells,’ said Sarah Holland, of the Met Office.

‘In
the morning there is a chance of the odd shower in the South East, but 
most places will be dry and sunny with temperatures around 17C (63F) in 
London.

Amber nectar: Richard Johnson, quality manager at Thatchers Cider, inspects the blossom from one of the apple trees at the orchards in Sandford, Somerset

Silver lining: The blossom has arrived late, but inspectors say its strength is encouraging

Looks promising: All that's needed now is some warm weather to ensure the blossom trees bear fruit, cider-makers say

Closer look: Bad weather last year crippled the harvest and proved disastrous for growers

‘Tomorrow will see a
cold start and a chance of grass frost, but once the sun comes out it 
will warm up quickly and see temperatures of around 17C or 18C.’

Scotland,
which had snow this week, can also look forward to some much-needed 
sunshine over the course of the bank holiday, forecasters said.

On
Monday, East Anglia and Kent will get the best of the weather, where 
temperatures could climb as high as 20C (68F) but  cloud and rain will 
move across the country from the west later in the day.

Making the best of it: Adorable 18-month-old Lucy Evans was wrapped up in a winter coat and woolly hat to play on Southsea beach at the start of the late May Bank Holiday today

Newcomer: One of the fluffy chicks takes some faltering steps under the watchful gaze of an adult flamingo

Weather impact: The cold weather meant the greater flamingos seen at this Lancashire nature reserve today were late to lay their eggs

Chilly: A greater flamingo looks over one of four chicks born at the reserve, where the team are expecting many more to hatch in the coming weeks

Welcome addition: The greater flamingos at the reserve have been bred in captivity and are friendly and sociable birds, staff say

Curious: The fluffy chick wanders around the enclosure, where the greater flamingos - traditionally from the Mediterranean and parts of Africa, nest on bark chippings

Over the half-term break next week the weather is expected to be unsettled, with a mixture of heavy showers and sunshine.

The
mixed weather appears to have left supermarkets in a quandary. Asda 
forecast sales of sausages to increase by 144 per cent and barbecue food
by 84 per cent, come rain or shine.

However,
bosses at the chain have also called in an extra 100,000 pairs of 
wellies ahead in case the weather takes a turn for the worse.

Better things to come: After a dismal start to the weekend, forecasters say the sun will make an appearance over the Bank Holiday

High winds: A lorry carrying car parts overturned on the A1 southbound at Wetherby today as a result of the strong winds
