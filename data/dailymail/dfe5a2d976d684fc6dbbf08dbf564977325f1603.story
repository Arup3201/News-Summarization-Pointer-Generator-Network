Booking a trip to the Indian Ocean used to guarantee a holiday free of squealing children.

Then families became adventurous.

But childless grown-ups need not despair. The dodo might be extinct on Mauritius, but peace and quiet still reigns - at least on the east coast of the island.

Come slip into the sunshine: Mauritius is an island where relaxation comes easily

We are staying here, at the stately Le Touessrok resort, in pretty Trou D’Eau Douce.

After a 12-hour flight and 40-minute taxi ride, we arrive in time for breakfast. A juice chef whizzes up fresh smoothies, another flips pancakes, and there is a buffet groaning with fruit.

Our room is in one of the villas sprinkled along a soft-sand beach.

Place of retreat: Le Touessrok, where stars including Roger Federer have stayed, has an understated elegance

The bath is as big as a car, and there is a view of the Indian Ocean from the vast bed.

Mauritius’s
 hot, sunny and sometimes rainy peak season stretches from October to 
April. The large, green-tiled spa pool is pleasantly quiet and 
adults-only. The kids’ club is cleverly located a five-minute walk from 
the centre of the hotel.

Le Touessrok also owns a nearby island, Isle Majorelle. Take a boat trip and you’ll find tranquillity abounds - with sea urchins the only disturbance.

Across the water on Isle aux Cerfs, water sports are in action: sailing, kayaking and snorkelling are all included in the price. It’s best to go first thing or late in the afternoon to avoid the crowds.

We force ourselves to leave the resort and take a day trip to the spectacular Botanical Gardens, famed for Giant Water Lilies, bamboos and cinnamon plants.

A dreamy place for escape: Mauritius offers a lush Indian Ocean landscape as well as luxury retreats

On the way back, we pop into the touristy capital St Louis - but far more fun are the free hotel-led cycling trips to two villages, Trou D’eau Douce and Bel Air.

Back at Le Touessrok, we eat like kings. Dinners are at the haute cuisine Indian restaurant Safran, on the sand at Barlen or at the buffet; offering everything from fish curries to pizza.

Sports stars love Le Touessrok too.

Roger Federer and Chelsea’s Eden Hazard have been spotted here.

This grand but not flash resort has space enough to accommodate families and loved-up couples, celebs and mere mortals.

Kuoni (0800 092 4444, www.kuoni.co.uk) offers seven nights B&B in
 a Deluxe Ocean View room at Le Touessrok, from £1,539 per person in January 
2015, including flights and transfers.
