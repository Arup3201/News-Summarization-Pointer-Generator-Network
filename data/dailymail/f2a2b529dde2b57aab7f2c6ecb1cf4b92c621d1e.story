For single mother Melody Russell, the Grinch nearly stole Christmas.

But thanks to the generosity of local cops, her two children have presents to unwrap tomorrow morning.

Burglars broke into the 33-year-old's Tampa, Florida, home yesterday, snatching 10 wrapped gifts sitting underneath the Christmas tree and the family's puppy, Honey.

Melody Russell: The single mother said she was at work when her house was robbed

The property manager said she returned to her North 50th Street house after work to find the back door open and her some of her belongings gone.

Her children, Marissa, seven, and Marcus, five, were at her sister's house at the time of the robbery.

Russell said Marissa cried for 30 minutes when she broke the sad news about their 12-week-old Shih Tzu. The dog wasn't micro-chipped.

'My kids are so in love with that puppy,' Russell told The Detroit News.

Russell said she had bought her children only modest gifts - Nerf guns and slippers and Ninja turtle toys - but they were meaningful.

'Typical Christmas stuff,' Russell said. 'Nothing extravagant.'

Devastated by the thieves' brazen robbery, Russell said she sat in her living room and prayed for strength.

Then, at 1am this morning, Russell's phone rang.

It was Tampa police. Officers had attended the home yesterday when Russell reported the robbery.

But this time, an officer called to tell Russell that the entire squad was coming to her house with gifts.

When police dispatchers and Squad 204 heard about the theft, they quickly chipped in to buy Marissa and Marcus presents.

'Every single one of them had gifts in their hands,' Russell told The Detroit News. 'I was so in shock.'

Each present, hand-delivered by police in the wee hours, was signed 'From Santa'.
