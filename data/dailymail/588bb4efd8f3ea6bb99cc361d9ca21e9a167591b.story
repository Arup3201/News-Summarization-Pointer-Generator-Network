An undertaker who poured flour over a neighbour’s Mercedes for blocking in his hearse was jailed yesterday.

Funeral director Julian Riley, 39, and Peter Elliot, 60, had argued over parking for weeks after the property developer bought a house opposite Riley’s business, a court heard.

Then last September Riley was caught on CCTV emptying a 2lb bag of self-raising flour over Mr Elliot’s black Mercedes E-320.

The court was told it set ‘like cement’ when it rained and some of it could not be removed without scratching the paintwork.

Police arrested Riley after following a line of white powder back to his funeral parlour in the village of Clydach near Abergavenny, South Wales.

He was jailed for two weeks by Newport magistrates after admitting causing criminal damage, ordered to pay £200 compensation and banned from contacting his neighbour.

Prosecutor Rob Simkins said: 'The case revolves around a dispute between Julian Riley and Peter Elliot.

'It came to a head when Riley poured flour over Mr Elliot's Mercedes. The flour covered the windscreen, bonnet and roof.

'A trail of white powder led from the vehicle across the road to the defendant's property.' 

Riley fell out with Mr Elliot after he bought a house opposite his funeral parlour.

Newport Magistrates heard the pair had argued over parking for weeks - and Riley threw flour over Mr Elliot's car after he left it unattended for just 25 minutes.

Property developer Mr Elliot was convinced the undertaker had covered his cherished Mercedes in 'embalming powder'.

Riley told police: 'I didn't do it' but officers checked CCTV at the funeral parlour and found footage of him pouring flour all over the car.

Paul Lewis, defending, said: 'There was a festering dispute and Mr Riley lost his rag.

'He's spoilt things for himself by not dealing with things in a more common sense manner.'

The funeral director has fallen into 'financial difficulty' fighting the case and has now put his hearse up for sale.
