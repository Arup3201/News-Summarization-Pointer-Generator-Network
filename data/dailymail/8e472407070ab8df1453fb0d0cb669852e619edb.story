Under-fire Italy coach Antonio Conte is determined to turn things around with the national team, despite reportedly receiving death threats in the days leading up to the Azzurri's friendly against England.

Italy welcome Roy Hodgson's men for a glamour friendly at Juventus Stadium on Tuesday, just nine months since they beat the Three Lions in their World Cup opener.

However, like England, their tournament ended with a group-stage exit, with former Juventus manager Conte subsequently brought in to replace Cesare Prandelli at the helm.

It has not been the easiest of rides so far, with tension heightened last week when the Italy coach reportedly received death threats from angry Juventus fans over the treatment of Claudio Marchisio.

The midfielder, who netted the opener against England in Brazil, ruptured knee ligaments while warming up on the eve of Italy's Euro 2016 qualifier against Bulgaria - a match the Azzurri required a late goal to draw 2-2.

John Elkann, the president of the holding company which controls Juventus, also criticised Conte, who returns to his old stomping ground on Tuesday looking to build some positivity.

'The fans need to support Italy, so I think I have an excellent relationship with Italy fans,' he said.

'They know that we are working hard - myself, the players, everyone. We're all trying to work at a time which is not easy.

'So when everyone gives everything that they've got in what they're doing, you hope that is being appreciated.'

This, Conte says, is a transitional period for the Azzurri as they attempt to blood in new, untested players.

It is a big ask but one Conte is determined to carry on with, reciting a quote by former Olympic 200 metres champion Pietro Mennea in the pre-match press conference.

'I know it will not be easy but I am carrying on in my work,' he said. 'Mennea said that, to achieve big dreams, one must make great effort.'

The Italy coach's desire to find the right formula will see him tinker with the side against England, ahead of which he took the unusual step of naming his starting line-up.

Uncapped Mirko Valdifiori and Southampton striker Graziano Pelle are amongst the starters, as are the vastly-experienced Giorgio Chiellini and Gianluigi Buffon.

The latter's experience is more important than ever right now, with even the goalkeeper, capped 146 times, surprised by this week's events.

'Obviously the last few days have not been boring, by any means,' Buffon said, laughing. 'We can quite calmly say that.

'But it is also true that this sort of energy is better to really release than to bottle it up because that can ultimately lead to defeats.'
