People who achieve better grades at university are more likely to experience feelings of romantic jealousy on Facebook, according to a new study.

The study asked undergraduates to imagine scenarios like discovering a message in their partnerâ€™s Facebook inbox from a person of the opposite sex saying: 'What are you up to later?'

They found that those with a higher level of intelligence or grade point average (GPA) were the most jealous.

The latest research has found that people who get better grades at university are more likely to get jealous of ambiguous Facebook messages sent to their partners

While the findings are 
preliminary, researcher Denise Friedman, an associate 
professor of psychology at Roanoke College in Salem, Virginia, who carried out the study, said: 'It
may be that people with high GPAs tend to have a personality type that 
makes them more prone to jealousy.

'Students with 
higher GPAs are often more conscientious, show greater self-control and 
tend to be perfectionists.

'The perceived infidelity likely upsets their attempts at perfection across the board.'

The study also looked at
whether adding different emoticons (like smiley or winking
faces) after the message would affect jealousy levels.

While it has been found that women are more 'Facebook jealous' than men, men feel jealous when emoticons are used at the end of messages to their partners

While
it has previously been proven that women have higher levels of Facebook jealousy than men, men 
were actually more jealous when the message had an emoticon.

'Evolutionary
work suggests men are more jealous of sexual infidelity, while women 
are more jealous of emotional infidelity,

'The
winking emoticon was most likely perceived as flirtatious, perhaps even
sexually suggestive, which may explain why men were more jealous in 
this condition,' Friedman added.
