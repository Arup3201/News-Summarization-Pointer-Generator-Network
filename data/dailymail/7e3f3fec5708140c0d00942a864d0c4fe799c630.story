Prince Harry's girlfriend Cressida Bonas has flown out of the country, leaving the royal facing a lonely New Year.

The 24-year-old is currently holidaying with her half sister, Isabella Branson, on Virgin tycoon Sir Richard's private Caribbean island, Necker, Mail Online can reveal.

Friends have not ruled out the prince deciding to join her at the last minute -  but it looks as if Harry will miss being with his girlfriend of 19 months for both Christmas and New Year.

The report scotches claims the fourth
 in line to the throne is tonight throwing a dinner party  Sandringham, 
the Queen's Norfolk estate, where Cressida will be a guest.

According
 to several informed sources, she is already lapping up the sun with 
Isabella - formerly Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe - who married 
Sam Branson, Sir Richard's son, earlier this year.

The
 holiday was arranged before Prince Harry announced he would undertake a
 charity trek to the South Pole in aid of Walking With The Wounded in 
December, which kept the couple apart for almost four weeks.

He
 arrived home last week and immediately met up with Cressida, spending 
the weekend together at the Branson mansion in Kidlington, Oxfordshire.

They stayed as guests of Sam, 28, and Isabella, 33.

Harry was seen with Sam  in The Bell pub at Hampton Poyle on Sunday before he later returned to the mansion nearby.

Sir
 Richard gave the mansion to his daughter Holly, 31, and son after 
deciding to spend most of his time on his Caribbean island of Necker.

The couple were parted when Harry drove to Sandringham for Christmas, where the Queen celebrated with her closest family.

Cressida was with her own family before flying out of the country.

'Harry
 doesn't appear to have gone with her. Although it is unlikely, I 
couldn't rule out him joining her at some point,' said a friend.

'The relationship is increasingly serious but Cressida is also very close to Isabella and she would never let her down.

'If
 he decides not to go they will have plenty of time together after New 
Year and a ski holiday is most definitely on the cards.

'Cressida is a very good skier, unlike Harry's former girlfriend, Chelsy Davy, who hated the cold.

She and Harry are looking forward to getting away with each other.'

Harry is due to  return to duty as an Apache helicopter pilot in the next few weeks.

The Prince and Cressida were introduced last year by his cousin and her best friend, Princess Eugenie.

Described
 by friends as ‘bubbly and terribly, terribly sweet’, they were earlier 
this year photographed smooching on the ski slopes of Verbier and 
enjoying dinner dates and nights on the town.

Despite their increasing closeness friends have moved to dismiss rumours that the couple are set to get engaged.

Cressida, 24, recently graduated from a dance course but is believed to be considering a career in teaching instead.

Cressida
 is the daughter of four-times married and divorced Lady Mary Gaye 
Curzon, a renowned 60s society beauty who once posed semi-naked for a 
glossy coffee table photography book called Birds of Britain.

She has five children with three of her husbands of which one is Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe.

Cressida
 was the product of her third marriage to Old Harrovian businessman 
Jeffrey Bonas, which ended in divorce after six years in 1994.

In
 an interview with US television last year, handsome Harry complained 
that girls appeared to be put off by his title and indicated he was keen
 to shed his playboy tag.

‘I’m
 not so much searching for someone to fulfill the role, but obviously, 
you know, finding  someone that would be willing to take it on,’ he 
said.

Meanwhile, 
well-placed sources close to the prince firmly scotched reports that 
Harry is holding a dinner party at Sandringham to which Cressida was 
invited.

'It's not true. Cressida isn't at, or going to Sandringham,' they said.

Another
 source added: 'That's not something that would happen when the Queen is
 in residence, as she will be until early February.'

On
 Christmas Eve, Harry went head-to-head with his brother Prince William 
in a charity friendly football match on the Sandringham Estate.

During
 the match between estate workers the Duke of Cambridge jokingly pleaded
 with the referee to give his brother a yellow card for 'backchat'.

The now traditional pre-Christmas fixture ended in a 2-2 draw.
