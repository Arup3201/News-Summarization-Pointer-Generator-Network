One person has been taken to hospital after a boat crashed into the shore and slammed into a beach bar.

The vessel, which had seven people on board, ran aground in Little Harbor near Ruskin and hit the front of the Sunset Grille at around 5pm on Monday. 

After crossing the beach, the hull splintered the outside of the venue and ended up inside.

Collision: After crossing the beach, the hull splintered the outside of the venue and ended up inside.

Two people on board were said to have suffered minor injuries and it is unknown whether anyone was inside the restaurant at the time. 

Bob Schafer, an ironworker visiting from Pennsylvania, saw the crash unfold.

The 50-year-old told the Tampa Bay Times the person driving the boat 'just kept going straight and never turned'.

He and his wife Jackie said the boat disappeared into thick fog so they could only hear the impact. 

Emergency crews responded to the scene and were seen trying to remove it from the restaurant. 

The boat is a 39-foot SeaVee with quad 300 horsepower engines.
