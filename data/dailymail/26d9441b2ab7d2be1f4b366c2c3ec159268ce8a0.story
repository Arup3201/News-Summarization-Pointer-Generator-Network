When’s daddy coming home?

That's the heartbreaking question asked by two young children to the Perth wife of Paul Weeks, who was on board MH370 when it mysteriously disappeared three weeks ago.

Waiting 17 days for confirmation, 40-year old Danica Weeks received the worst news possible - her 39-year old husband was among the 239 killed when aircraft crashed into a remote area of the southern Indian Ocean and killed all on board.

The couple have two young sons Lincoln, 3, and Jack, 11 months, and moved to Perth in 2011 following earthquakes in Mr Weeks' native New Zealand.

Setting up a new life in Australia, the Weeks' lived in Perth's northern outskirts - just 15 minutes from RAAF Pearce, the aircraft base for the international search effort for the wreckage.

Mr Weeks boarded the plane so he could make his way to Mongolia to start his new fly-in-fly-out job as a mechanical engineer.

But since the plane went missing, Mrs Weeks said her world had been turned upside down and she now has the harrowing task of explaining to her sons what happened to their father.

'When you look into your children’s eyes and I feel the pain because I know personally the man Paul was and I now the enormity of what they’re going to miss out on for the rest of their lives,' Mrs Weeks told 60 Minutes in an interview with the Nine Network, set to air Sunday night.

'That is so overwhelming for me that when I look at Lincoln I have to tell him his dad has gone,' she added.

Despite not knowing why MH370 crashed, Mrs Weeks said she was going to have to tell her children their father was gone.

'I think I have to because you’ve got to tell the kids the truth,' she said.

'But even Lincoln this morning he was having a meltdown and he’s "I’m missing daddy I’m missing daddy when’s daddy coming home?" Is daddy still missing?'

In a cruel twist, the first search area off the coast of Western Australia indicated that the Boeing 777 may have passed over Perth before it plunged into the ocean 1800km west of the city.

'We thought they were flying the other way and look until a week they were still searching up there, yeah but to know they had flown straight past us,' Mrs Weeks said of the previous search area.

'So close and I would’ve been out at the shops at the time.

'I’ve thought this through... I was in Perth merrily going along our family way while he was crashing into the ocean.'

The search has since been diverted to an area 1100km northeast of where teams had been looking for a week, far off Western Australia, making it unlikely that the aircraft had passed over Perth.

The day after the plane disappeared, Mrs Weeks took to Facebook to describe how she was feeling, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

'Thank you all for your thoughts, in a place I never wanted to be, trying to gather strength for my two beautiful boys, miss my darling with all my heart. X,' she posted.

Mrs Weeks found out by a text message from Malaysia Airlines that her husband had likely been killed when the plane crashed in the Indian Ocean.

Malaysia Airlines said in a statement it had informed nearly 1000 family members about details of the crash in person or by phone and only via SMS where absolutely necessary.

Before leaving bound for Mongolia, Mr Weeks left his wedding ring and watch at home.

Mrs Weeks received a text while her husband was waiting in Kuala Lumpur for the connecting flight to Beijing that said he already missed the family.

Mr Weeks' sister Sara was informed of the situation when her mother called her to share the news and has since lashed out about the handling the crash Perth Now  reported.

'The whole situation has been handled appallingly, incredibly insensitively,' she told Radio Live in New Zealand on Thursday.

'Everyone is angry about it. The Malaysian government, the airline, it’s just all been incredibly poor.'

'Who’s to say they couldn’t have located the plane the day that it happened.'

She added that information had been withheld and took too long to be communicated.

Sara Weeks described not knowing what happened as a nightmare, with the family still waiting for closure.

'The not knowing is awful and, to be honest, we still don’t know. They haven’t given us any tangible evidence on how they know that plane is there,' she told More FM in New Zealand.

'To just ... say everyone’s dead, that’s where the plane is, without offering up any sort of evidence, it has been really difficult.'

Malaysia Airlines will fly Sara Weeks to Perth so she can be with her sister-in-law Danica as the search for the wreckage continues.

Mr Weeks' sister plans to meet other families who lost loved ones on the flight.
