AC Milan will only make a move for Liverpool midfielder Suso once he becomes a free agent this summer, according to club administrator Adriano Galliani.

Reports in Italy claim the 21-year-old, whose current deal with the Reds expires in July, has agreed a four-year contract with the Rossoneri outfit and could even join the San Siro club this month.

When asked about Suso, Galliani told his club's official website: 'It's a hypothesis.

AC Milan have ruled out bringing 21-year-old Suso to the club in January

'I've known him since he played for Spain's Under 19 team.

'His contract runs out and he is keen to join us. It's a viable hypothesis from July 1 when his contract with Liverpool expires.'

Suso moved to Anfield from Cadiz in 2010 but has made just 14 Premier League appearances for Liverpool since.

He spent last season on loan in La Liga with Almeria and impressed at the heart of the side's attack.
