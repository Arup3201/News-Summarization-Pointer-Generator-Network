So this is what £32m buys you in modern football. 

Manchester City's expensive new defender Eliaquim Mangala suffered a nightmare first half as he was responsible for the champions surrendering a 2-0 lead at Hull. 

After Sergio Aguero and Edin Dzeko had scored for the visitors, the Frenchman someone contrived to head past Willy Caballero, on his first Premier League appearance, to bring Hull back into it on 21 minutes.

And just 10 minutes we hauled down Abel Hernandez in the penalty area, and the Uruguayan striker picked himself up to bring the scores level. 

A shell shocked Manchester City went in at half-time drawing 2-2 with work to do in the second period. 

Can Mangala redeem himself and help his team clinch three points.
