Rybus impressed during Poland's 1-1 draw with Republic of Ireland last month.

The former Legia Warsaw player made his debut for his country in Franciszek Smuda's first match in charge, a friendly versus Romania in November 2009, but has been used predominately as a substitute. 

He then scored his first goal for Poland four days later in a match against Canada.  

In 27 appearances for club and country this season, Rybus has scored three goals.
