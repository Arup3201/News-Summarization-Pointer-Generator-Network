For the man with a thousand things on his mind, this could be all his wishes in one.

Prime Minister David Cameron is soon to be given his very own iPad application that will bring together the latest information from across government at the touch of a button.

At a glance, he will be able to see up-to-date crime statistics, unemployment numbers, NHS waiting-list data and all kinds of other facts and figures which otherwise might get missed in his hectic schedule.

Hectic routine: Programmers are devising an app so Prime Minster David Cameron (above) can keep up to date with all the latest Government information at any time of the day

According to The Times, the idea for the app came after his advisers went on a trip to the U.S.

It is being created by programmers inside the Cabinet Office and will also include 'real time' feeds from Google, Twitter and other news outlets.

Mr Cameron, an avid iPad fan, already uses the device to read newspapers and the ConservativeHome and PoliticsHome websites.Â 

Who needs the Cabinet now? Mr Cameron will be getting the latest facts and figures from Government departments straight to his iPad

He also listens to TuneIn radio, which relays the BBC and other channels over wi-fi.

But it is also a way for him to relax.
He takes his iPad on flights where he catches up episodes of U.S. drama Desperate Housewives and The Killing.

In other ways, however, Mr Cameron is far more traditional when it comes to communication.

Differing styles: Mr Cameron prefers to communicate by writing notes on official papers, whereas his predecessor Gordon Brown (right) used secure e-mails

Unlike
his predecessor Gordon Brown, who had a secure e-mail address linked 
with the government network, Mr Cameron prefers to receive papers on 
which he can write notes which can then be reviewed by staff.

Mr Cameron does, however, stay in informal contact with MPs and advisers via text message.

The app is expected to be ready by March and could be made more widely available beyond just the Prime Minister.
