Death: Daniel Gliksten vanished in the early hours of New Year's Day near Budapest's Chain Bridge

The death of a British medical student who vanished during New Year's Eve celebrations in Hungary's capital is set to remain a mystery.

Daniel Gliksten, 23, was found dead in the River Danube almost three months after he vanished near Budapest's Chain Bridge in the early hours of January 1 last year.

The first-year student's devastated mother Cecilia Gliksten, 57, who run the 1,200-acre Denham Estate near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, was among thousands who joined a frantic search which included the British and Swedish embassies.

She flew to the Hungarian capital with other relatives as a Facebook search group gained almost 2,000 members.

But the hunt ended in tragedy when the body of Mr Gliksten, who held dual British and Swedish nationality, was found almost three months later some miles downstream.

This week an inquest into the student's death was held in his home county of Suffolk, but ruled the mystery of how he vanished was unlikely to ever be solved.

Suffolk coroner Dr Peter Dean said post-mortem examination tests showed Mr Gliksten had drowned, most likely two to three months before his body was discovered.

He said there was no suggestion of anyone else being involved in the student's death, but there was no firm evidence about how he came to be in the water.

Dr Dean told the hearing in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk: 'We have a very sad situation where Daniel has clearly gone missing.

'This may well have been a tragic accident... But we simply don’t have any eyewitness accounts of that and the only conclusion I can draw is an open conclusion.'

The student's friend Anna Oláh, who submitted a report to police about his disappearance, saw him for the last time at 2am and he was captured near the bridge on CCTV shortly afterwards.

Daniel’s remains were found months later by horrified passer-by Gyula Kukucska, the inquest heard.

Ms Oláh recognised the pair of trousers, belt and set of keys on the body and other marks in the description of Daniel were also identified.

Taken with the post-mortem examination findings and dental records and images, it was possible to identify the deceased person as 'highly likely' to be Daniel, the inquest heard.

Dr Dean said some alcohol was in his blood, but no 'great evidential weight' could be placed on it because of the decomposition of the body.

Mr Gliksten was a popular former pupil at the £20,000-a-year Culford School near Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.

He left for Semmelweis University in Budapest to realise his ambition of studying medicine.

His  father Michael, a former director of Charlton Athletic FC who died in 2009, bought the rambling Denham Estate from the Land Settlement Association in 1980.

It boasts one of the largest fallow deer populations in the country, and together with the student's Swedish mother the businessman supplied London restaurants and Cambridge colleges with venison for 20 years.

The sprawling farm also produces wheat, barley, oilseed rape, maize and spring barley and has a rare breed sheep, the Denham Castle lamb, which is unique to it.

The coroner recorded an open verdict. Mrs Gliksten was too upset to comment on her son's death following the hearing.
