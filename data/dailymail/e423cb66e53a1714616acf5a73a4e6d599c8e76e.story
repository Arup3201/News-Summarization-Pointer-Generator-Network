Joleon Lescott has confirmed that he is set to leave Manchester City after winning every domestic honour with the club and fired a parting shot, saying: 'Not bad for a money grabber!'

The England defender is still hurt at how he was portrayed when he joined City from Everton for £22million in August 2009, with furious Everton fans claiming that a £100,000-a-week salary was his only motivation.

But after winning his second Premier League title on Sunday, Lescott believes he has been vindicated after reaching the end of his five-year contract.

Moving on: Joleon Lescott has confirmed he will leave Manchester City at the end of his contract this summer

Happy memories: Lescott won two league titles, the FA Cup, the League Cup and the Community Shield during his time at the Etihad

‘Two titles, FA Cup, League Cup, Community Shield, not bad for a money grabber eh?’ he said. ‘Not a bad decision in the end.’

Asked if there was a feeling of sadness to be leaving the champions, he added: ‘Definitely. The way it all started and speculation about my reasons for coming here. Hopefully I’ve shut everybody up now.’

Lescott made 24 appearances for City this season but has fallen down the pecking order of centre-back partners for Vincent Kompany behind Martin Demichelis and Matija Nastasic, who has been out with a knee injury.

The 31-year-old almost joined West Ham in the January transfer window and has been in talks with Turkish club Besiktas as he weighs up his next move.

‘It is the end,’ he said. ‘I know I’m going to be leaving. We’ve had a good relationship, this club has been a big part of me. I know the business side of it. We’ve been successful and I hold no grudges.

‘Everyone talks about how you look back when your career has finished on what you’ve won – I can look back and say I’ve won some amazing things.

‘Now I’m 
going to see what’s best for me and my family and then make a decision. 
I’ve spoken to a number of clubs in different countries but there’s been
 no decision made. I want to get it sorted soon. I don’t want to leave 
it until after the World Cup but at the same time I won’t rush.

‘I
 won't go anywhere that I'll win more trophies than I do here. It will 
be a different mindset wherever I go. They’ll have goals and ambitions. 
Now I’ll just go and enjoy playing some games.’

Criticised: Some Everton fans accused Lescott of being a 'money-grabber' after his move to City in 2009

Fresh faced: Lescott fell out of favour after the arrival of Matija Nastasic (left) in the summer of 2012

Lescott admits that he is somewhat mystified by the way he fell out of favour at City after helping them win the title under Roberto Mancini in 2012, and in particular how he lost his place following Nastasic’s arrival from Fiorentina.

‘It was a bit strange,’ he added. ‘I came back from Euros 2012 as high as I could ever be after winning the league and scoring for England at the Euros.

‘I came back and read reports that my confidence was dented by the signing of Nastasic. He did well, Matija, but my confidence couldn’t have been any higher.

‘Now I’m 
going to see what’s best for me and my family and then make a decision. 
I’ve spoken to a number of clubs in different countries but there’s been
 no decision made. I want to get it sorted soon. I don’t want to leave 
it until after the World Cup but at the same time I won’t rush.

‘I
 won't go anywhere that I'll win more trophies than I do here. It will 
be a different mindset wherever I go. They’ll have goals and ambitions. 
Now I’ll just go and enjoy playing some games.’

New start: Lescott wants to find a new club where he will play games more regularly than at City

Gareth Barry, Scott Sinclair, Micah Richards and Jack Rodwell could all leave the Etihad this summer at a time when City face Financial Fair Play sanctions from UEFA that could see their foreign player quota for the Champions League cut by four next season.

‘As far as I'm concerned it’s the end,’ said Lescott. ‘If something changed then great, but if not there are no hard feelings between me and the club. I’ve had a great relationship with them.

‘I’d have to weigh it up. There’s a lot to consider. This club is going to win things over the next couple of years and I’d like to be a part of that. I didn’t play as often as I’d have liked but I still made nearly 25 appearances, so I’ve played my part.’
