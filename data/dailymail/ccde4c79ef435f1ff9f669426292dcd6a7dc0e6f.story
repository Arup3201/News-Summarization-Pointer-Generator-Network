A stunning mansion in an area known as Billionaires’ Row has come up for sale for a wallet-busting £40million.

Jersey House on The Bishops Avenue in Hampstead, London, comes complete with a cinema and ten bathrooms.

It also boasts eight bedrooms, a library, games room, gym, staff quarters and a 1.2-acre garden.

Now that's real estate: This stunning mansion in The Bishops Avenue, Hampstead, has gone on the market for nearly £40million

Ambassadorial reception: The house comes with eight bedrooms, ten bathrooms, a salon and even a cinema

The Bishops Avenue is one of London's richest streets and used to go by the name 'Millionaires' Row'.

But over the past 20 years, the wealth of its foreign residents has risen with properties now only occupied by the super-rich.

It is understood the Saudi Royal Family own ten of the street's 66 properties, with other billionaire owners including the Sultan of Brunei and Britain's richest man, Lakshmi Mittal.

Very few of these ambassadorial-type houses come onto the market and they attract global attention on the rare occasions they are made available.

Bittersweet buy: At close to £40million, the next buyer would have to pay a hefty £2.73million in stamp duty

All the mod cons: The mansion is equipped with a number of high-tech features which can be controlled via iPad

With the next owner expected to be a security-conscious foreign national, the mansion is equipped with a number of high-tech features, including interior and exterior CCTV cameras which can be controlled via iPad.

The luxury home also boasts a state-of-the-art indoor pool complex which includes steam, sauna and fitness rooms. It opens out onto a large sunken terrace with a reflecting pool and waterfall.

There is also a private massage and hair salon with its own bathroom, reached from the main house or through the staff entrance for complete privacy.

It also has a Poggenpohl and Gaggenau fully-fitted kitchen and a double height atrium.

Sought after: Very few of these ambassadorial-type houses come onto the market and they attract global attention when they do

The property is being marketed by the Mayfair office of Harrods Estates with the unnamed owner asking for £39,500,000.

At this price, the next buyer would then have to pay a hefty £2.73 million in stamp duty.

Shirley Humphrey, director at Harrods Estates, said: 'This beautiful home is a truly rare opportunity to purchase in one of the world’s most exclusive addresses.

'Jersey House combines lavish open spaces with stunning interiors and offers everything a high net worth individual expects from a super prime London property.'

With an average property price approaching £10million, The Bishops Avenue was the most expensive street in Britain until being eclipsed last year by Kensington Palace Gardens, where Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich lives.

With averages there rising to nearly £20million, that equates to 93 times the national average house price of around £210, 000. Even a single square foot of land in the street would cost you £1,193.
