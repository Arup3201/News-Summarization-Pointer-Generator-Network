David Cameron, pictured speaking at the Nato summit, said the West faced a generational struggle against poisonous extremism and all options would be considered to support regional allies

Britain last night signed up to a mission to crush the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.

David Cameron said the West faced a generational struggle against poisonous extremism and all options would be considered to support regional allies.

Barack Obama declared: ‘The bottom line is we will do what is necessary.’

The US president’s secretary of state said it might take years but the self-styled caliphate would be wiped out.

John Kerry told the Nato summit in Newport, Wales: ‘Leaving them in some capacity intact anywhere would leave a cancer in place that will ultimately come back to haunt us.’

The US asked nine other countries to join what it called a ‘core coalition’ against IS: Britain, France, Germany, Canada, Australia, Turkey, Italy, Poland and Denmark.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Clearly, military commitment is required and what I’ve said is that nothing is ruled out. We’ll act in our national interest.’

However, the Prime Minister stressed Britain was ‘not yet at that stage’ and joining air strikes could only happen after the formation of a properly representative government in Iraq.

One senior Government source urged people to ‘cool the jets’ on the prospect of Britain joining the US in air strikes within days.

The source said a meeting of the UN general assembly in New York in three weeks would be a crucial moment.

As well as bringing horror to the people of northern Iraq, Islamic State – known as IS or Isil – has murdered two US hostages and threatened to kill British aid worker David Haines.

The US and the UK want to avoid the mistakes of the Blair-Bush era and taking military action with little support from regional powers or a clear post-conflict plan.

Mr Obama drew criticism last week after admitting he had no strategy for confronting IS yet. He faces unpalatable choices about new alliances. Former foe Iran is understood to have agreed to talks about how to contain the threat.

In Syria, the role of President Assad, who was the target of proposed air strikes by the US and the UK a year ago, will also be crucial.

The US has already launched limited air strikes in Iraq, but only when IS was advancing and threatening new humanitarian catastrophes. The mission now being contemplated is far wider and will involve seeking to crush jihadists in areas they have already seized.

‘Our goal is to act with urgency,’ the US president said. ‘We have a strong political coalition. We are going to degrade and destroy Isil.’

Mr Cameron added: ‘We must use all the instruments at our disposal – humanitarian, diplomatic and military. We have agreed to offer a Nato training mission for Iraq as soon as a new Iraqi government is in place. The fight against IS must be led by the Iraqis themselves. But we will continue to encourage countries in the region to support this effort and to work with our partners on the ground to take all necessary steps to squeeze this barbaric terrorist organisation out of existence.’

÷ The leader of Somalia’s al-Shabaab terror group, Ahmed Abdi Godane, was killed in a US air strike, the Pentagon says. He was one of the world’s most wanted terrorists, with a £5million bounty on his head.

Special forces used missiles to destroy a camp and a vehicle on Monday, but did not confirm Godane had been killed until yesterday.
