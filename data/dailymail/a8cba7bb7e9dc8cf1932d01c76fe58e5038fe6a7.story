A 23-year-old student who died after she was brutally beaten outside a club in California may have sparked the savage attack by accidentally photo-bombing a group of people as they were trying to take a picture.

Kim Pham was declared brain dead in the wake of the Saturday morning incident in Santa Ana. On Tuesday, she was taken off life support and pronounced dead at 12.36pm.

A friend of the victim revealed that Pham was outside The Crosby club when she may have accidentally wandered in front of a camera as a group of partygoers posed for a snapshot.

Killed over a photo? Kim Pham was knocked to the ground and savagely beaten by a group of men and women after a friend said she may have accidentally ruined their picture by walking in front of the camera

Plea: Posters have been put near the crime scene appealing for information about the attackers

Disturbing: Police were quick to announce that they did not believe the attack was motivated by race, as the area has a large Vietnamese community that were concerned about a possible hate crime

A heated argument followed, which 
according to police, culminated with two men and three women beating 
Pham unconscious and leaving her for dead. 

One
 female suspect in her 20s is police custody and has been booked for 
assault with a deadly weapon causing great bodily injury. Her identity 
has not been released.

The suspect has not been named, but is 
described as in her 20s and has been arrested for suspicion of assault 
with a deadly weapon and causing great bodily harm. She was identified 
thanks to video footage of the attack filmed by a bystander.

In her personal blog, titled: ‘These Are the 7 Biggest Fears That You Need To Avoid
 Having In Your Twenties’ on the website Elite Daily, Miss Pham calls on
 people her age to stop being fearful.

On
 the ‘Fear of Missing Out’, a rationale she said was ‘empty’, she wrote:
 ‘We all have this guilt that tells us we should be doing one thing when
 we choose to do another.

‘We may even choose to justify it by 
announcing it on Facebook or Twitter to receive likes and lighthearted 
comments that perhaps make us feel more at ease about being “out 
studying the babes instead of studying for a midterm.” Don’t be a fool. 
Attend to the things you need to do in order to grow a better you.’

She
 tells her contemporaries to stop worrying about ‘Not Being Invited to 
the party’, instead claiming that it is merely the universe’s way of 
‘telling you that you’ve got more valuable things to be doing with your 
time’.

Brutal: A video that friends claimed showed the attack was shared on Facebook. It shows people trying to break up a fight in the street while someone is lying on the ground

On the scourge of social media, in the third part of her 
missive, ‘Fear That We Don’t Compare’, she wrote that spending hours 
stalking people online is pointless.

‘We are taught that with photos,
 we select the ones where smiles are fresh and forward — the good is 
often highlighted. As for your own life, don’t forget that sometimes the
 most beautiful lessons in life stem from the unconventional. The 
elevated focus on showing everyone how much of a superstar you are on 
social media is quite unnecessary.’

She explained that in ‘Fear of 
the Unknown, or What the Future Holds’: ‘The greatest harm we can do to 
ourselves is to not take the chance’.

Other ‘Fears’ she addresses include ‘Fear of Being Lonely’, ‘Fear of Rejection’ and ‘Fear of Getting Hurt’

‘Perhaps
 in our generation of self-promotion, egos yield a delicate tiptoe 
around the subject of getting hurt or being disappointed,’ she 
concludes. ‘However, we need to recognize that this fear should not 
paralyze us from feeling, living and loving.

‘If you are forthright 
in your own heart’s honest intent to love, you have nothing to worry 
about. Be bold, go forward, and love like hell.’

Scene: Investigators swarm the scene after the fight on Saturday morning. Police are looking for four suspects, while one has been arrested

Violent Police say a fight broke out between Pham and another woman, whose friends then stepped in

Miss Pham was rushed to hospital following the attack and listed in extremely critical condition.

1. Fear of Missing Out

2. Fear of Not Being Invited to the Party

3. Fear That We Don’t Compare

4. Fear of the Unknown, or What the Future Holds

5. Fear of Being Lonely

6. Fear of Rejection

7. Fear of Getting Hurt

Her
 family kept her on life support until they could donate her organs, 
according to the LA Times.

Her family only found out that she was an organ donor after she was admitted to hospital.

‘She
 would go out of her way to help others and never expect anything back 
from them’, her stepsister Lisa said. ‘That’s the kind of person she 
is.’

Police are offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to 
the arrests of four other suspects wanted in connection to the incident.

"The
 suspects were listed as two males and three females, Hispanic, between 
20 and 25 years of age," Santa Ana Police Corporal Anthony Bertagna told
 KABC.

Authorities are appealing for witnesses to come forward with footage of the attack after receiving reports that club-goers had taken out their cell phones.

One video posted on Facebook claims to be from a friend of the victim, although authorities have not yet confirmed its veracity.

The 10-second clip shows a person lying on the floor as they are surrounded by a group of people. A guard can be seen attempting to separate the crowd as witnesses look on, horrified.

Memorial
 posters and flowers have been placed outside the club, and friends and 
relatives spread posters online pleading for information into the 
attack.

A donation page was also set up for the family, but Pham's 
sister later said that they did not want to receive donations and would 
be returning the money.

Anyone with any information is urged to call the Santa Ana Police Department at (714) 245-839. You can also call OC Crime Stoppers at (855) TIP-OCCS.
