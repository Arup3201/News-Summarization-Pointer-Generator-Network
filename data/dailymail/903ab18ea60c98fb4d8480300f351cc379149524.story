Manuel Pellegrini described Arsenal’s talisman Alexis Sanchez as the best player in England this week, a comment which must have gone down like a lead balloon in his own dressing room where Sergio Aguero has his own claims on that title.

Aguero had netted 14 times before suffering a knee ligament injury in December. He made his comeback in the 1-1 draw with Everton last weekend. 

Meanwhile, Sanchez has been adding weight to the argument that he is the Premier League’s finest with two goals and one assist against Stoke.

With Man City trailing league leaders Chelsea by two points and Arsenal on the fringes of the top four, the two sides meet at the Etihad on Sunday. 

It is a crucial game with many intriguing subplots, not least the meeting of Aguero and Sanchez - two of the league’s most prolific goal scorers. But which South American will come out on top? Sportsmail has a look at their credentials.

PASSING

Aguero

A devastatingly accurate passer, with 83.38% of his passes this season reaching their intended target. Technically he is superb, finding space in tight situations to link up play. Combines particularly well with David Silva. 

SCORE: 9.5/10

Sanchez

A fan of the short pass he plays key passes at important times and seems to have a sixth sense of where his teammates are, sometimes not even looking up to check their position before delivering pinpoint service. 

SCORE: 8.5/10

Aguero scores against Sunderland, one of 14 Premier League goals this season

Sanchez has scored 13 Premier League goals for Arsenal this season since signing from Barcelona

SHOOTING 

Aguero

A predator, anticipates well and rarely misses when given a sniff at goal. Incredible balance and able to confound keepers with either foot and in myriad ways, whether it be a strike from distance or a nerveless sliced finish inside the box. 

SCORE: 9/10

Sanchez

A lethal finisher. For a small player, his rising header against Burnley in November showed his versatility in front of goal. The stats indicate the Chilean is more accurate at shooting than even Aguero. 

SCORE: 9.5/10

PACE

Aguero

Able to produce a thrilling burst of pace, switch speed, turn and take on players. Can make defenders look sluggish if they switch off for even a split second. 

SCORE: 9/10

Sanchez

Lightning quick and with a low centre of gravity, he is able to tear through the opposition’s defence with pace and power. Makes darting runs off-the-ball to free up other players. 

SCORE: 9/10

Sanchez's pace is one of his biggest assets and fits perfectly with Arsenal's style of play

SET PIECES

Aguero

Doesn’t provide much of an aerial threat from set pieces but can produce wonderful free kicks and enviable deliveries from corners.

SCORE: 9/10

Sanchez

His crossing is much improved and has been troubling defenders notably when Laurent Koscielny headed in his delivery from a corner against Stoke. Also scored from a free kick in that game. 

SCORE: 9.5/10

TEAMWORK

Aguero

Does not provide a lot of assists but that is not what his game is based on. Often produces the goods by going it alone. Has a never say die attitude and has dug City out of sticky situations several times this season. 

SCORE: 8/10

Sanchez

An unselfish hard worker who puts in a shift, he is said to have the same attitude in training as he does in games. Seemingly tireless he chases down every ball and raises the level of those around him. 

SCORE: 10/10

TOTAL

Ageuro: 44.5/50

Sanchez: 46.5/50
