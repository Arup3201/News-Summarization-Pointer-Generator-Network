Team news

Burnley

Burnley striker Danny Ings will miss Saturday's meeting with Sunderland after suffering a hamstring injury in last weekend's draw against Crystal Palace.

Ings joins long-term absentee Sam Vokes (knee) on the sidelines meaning Marvin Sordell and Ashley Barnes come into contention.

Matt Taylor is also out with a niggling Achilles problem but loan duo Nathan Chalobah and Michael Keane are eyeing debuts.

Provisional squad: Heaton, Trippier, Lafferty, Ward, Duff, Shackell, Mee, Wallace, Marney, Kightly, Cisak, Jones, Sordell, Reid, Jutkiewicz, Chalobah, Boyd, Gilks, Keane, Long, Barnes, Arfield.

Sunderland

Sunderland head coach Gus Poyet faces a series of difficult decisions ahead of Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Burnley.

The Uruguayan has no significant injury doubts as he looks for a first league win of the campaign and, as a result, needs to decide whether or not to change the side which started last Saturday's 2-2 draw with Tottenham.

Defender Billy Jones and midfielders Will Buckley and Jordi Gomez are among those men pushing for starting berths, although Poyet has indicated striker Connor Wickham, who was effective as a lone striker last weekend, will retain the role.

Provisional squad: Mannone, Pantilimon, Jones, Van Aanholt, Brown, O'Shea, Vergini, Coates, Roberge, Cattermole, Bridcutt, Rodwell, Gomez, Larsson, Johnson, Buckley, Giaccherini, Alvarez, Mavrias, Wickham, Fletcher, Altidore, Graham. 

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Burnley have won just one of the last 12 matches in all competitions against Sunderland (W1 D5 L6).

Steven Fletcher represented Burnley on the last occasion these sides met (2009/10); he remains Burnley’s leading Premier League scorer (eight goals).

No team has scored fewer goals than Burnley so far (1) in the Premier League this season.

The Clarets have drawn their last two games 0-0. The last team to draw three games 0-0 in a row were their rivals Blackburn in December 2009.

Three of Sunderland’s four Premier League games this season have been 1-1 at half-time.

Sunderland striker Connor Wickham has failed to score in his last seven Premier League games

After his flurry of five goals in three games to help Sunderland stay up last season, Connor Wickham has now gone seven Premier League games without one.

Sunderland are yet to win (three points from four games) in 2014-15 - last season they took only one point from their opening eight PL games.

Sunderland are one of three teams yet to keep a clean sheet this season (along with Arsenal and West Ham).

Jack Rodwell is the only Premier League player to have been subbed off in all four games this season.

Sunderland have lost only one of their last five Premier League away games (W2 D2 L1).
