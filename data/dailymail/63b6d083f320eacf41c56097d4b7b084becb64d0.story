After months of misery, the economy is on the mend – and it seems we all deserve a pat on the back.

For official figures show the average worker has been doing their bit for UK plc, working an extra 18 minutes each week.

The working week, which had been shrinking steadily for decades, is back on the rise,  mainly due to advances in technology, consumer demand and global competition.

Hard at work: The average week has increased for both full- and part-time workers in the past year

The latest data shows that the average time worked per week has increased by almost 20 minutes in a year.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics show average hours worked by all employees, full- and part-time, rose from 31.7 in the second quarter of 2012 to 32 in the second quarter of 2013.

Full-time workers’ hours rose from 37.2 to 37.5 over the same period, and those for part-timers rose from 15.8 to 15.9.

‘Until the 1990s, the working week was getting shorter by about an hour every decade,’ said Jim Hillage, director of research at the Institute for Employment Studies. ‘But that seems to have stopped and reversed.’

Longer days: Figures show full-time workers¿ weekly hours rose from 37.2 in 2012 to 37.5 this year, and those for part-timers rose from 15.8 to 15.9

Ben Willmott, head of public policy at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, said: ‘I think you could argue that the trend stopped some time ago.

‘For full-time employees there was a reduction in working hours up to May 2011 from 1992. Since then hours have been stable or even edged up.

‘There was a pronounced trend from the 1950s for decades, which saw a significant reduction. During the last 20 years, the reduction has been more moderate, and then it reached a plateau.’

Hillage added: ‘The demand for people-based services has increased enormously.  This has had the effect of lengthening working times.’

‘The use of technology has blurred the boundary between life and work,’ said Willmott, ‘with people perhaps working more out of hours but also using work time for domestic matters such as booking a holiday on-line.
