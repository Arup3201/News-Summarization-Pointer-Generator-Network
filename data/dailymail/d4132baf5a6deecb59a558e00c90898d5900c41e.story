A Star Wars collector has paid £18,000 at auction for a rare figurine which went on sale 35 years ago for just £1.50.

The unopened Boba Fett character, a bounty hunter from the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back, was one of 85 figures put on sale by Star Wars super-fan Craig Stevens.

The 45-year-old from Croydon, South London, has a staggering memorabilia collection of around 10,000.

The figure was one of only a handful still in 'factory fresh condition' and attracted bids from around the world.

In demand: The figure (pictured) was one of only a handful still in 'factory fresh condition' and attracted bids from around the world

Auction: The valuable Boba Fett figure was one of 85 put up for sale by Star Wars super-fan, Craig Stevens

Prized possession: Following the sale of the Boba Fett figure, Mr Stevens (pictured) said: 'I hope it will go to a good collector who will look after it and cherish it like I have'

The anonymous UK buyer who bid over the internet must also pay 20 per cent commission to the Vectis auction house in Teeside.

Following the sale, Mr Stevens said: 'I hope it will go to a good collector who will look after it and cherish it like I have.

'I'm amazed at the price. The money is going to go towards a house for me and my wife.'

Mr Stevens added: 'Star Wars had a tremendous effect on me. I began collecting everything I could get my hands on.'

The former chairman of the UK Star Wars fan club claims the Boba Fett figurine is one of only four or five in such pristine condition.

Before the auction he said: 'This Boba Fett is in the original packaging in the UK, it is in factory fresh condition, so I am looking at £10,000-plus for this one figure alone.

'He is a very popular character, he had about three minutes of screen time and became a huge cult figure. It was only available in this packaging for a year.'

Sold under the UK's Palitoy brand, the packaging is 'unpunched' which means the card had not been pierced to allow it to hang on a peg in a shop. 

Mint condition: The Boba Fett figure and this Darth Vader toy were among a handful that were 'factory fresh' and attracted bids from around the world

Vintage: Valuer Kathy Taylor said the figures, including this Yoda toy, came from the 'golden age' of Star Wars films

Staggering: The 85 figurines Mr Williams auctioned off are among the 10,000 he owns

Valuable: The Boba Fett figure (pictured) which sold for £18,000 would have retailed for £1.50 when it was released in 1980

The toy would have retailed for £1.50 when it was released in 1980. A figure in similar condition would sell for around £50 in 1990.

It was tough for him to part with the figure, as he was 'one of the children who queued up to see Star Wars when it was first released in 1977'.

He added: 'I began collecting everything that I could get my hands on connected to Star Wars and I have kept going right up to the present day.'

Valuer Kathy Taylor said the figures came from the 'golden age' of Star Wars films and rarely came to market.

She said: 'We have never had a collection like this.

'We do get a lot of toys here which make big money, but this is the first Star Wars collection that we have ever had that is of this calibre.'
