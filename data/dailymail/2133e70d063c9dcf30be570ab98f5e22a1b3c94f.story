A teenage boy was killed and a teen girl is in critical condition after they were hit by a freight train while walking to a high school dance, authorities said.

The pair were on their way to the Sadie Hawkins dance Friday night while crossing train tracks only steps from a game on a packed Little League field. The engineer reportedly told police they did not get out of the way in time.

The boy died at the scene and the girl was airlifted to hospital with traumatic injuries, a fire department spokesperson said, neither of their identities has been released.

The accident happened around 7.00 p.m., and in front of dozens of horrified onlookers scrambling to shield their children from the traumatizing scene, according to the Appeal-Democrat.

Parents attending the game raced towards the tracks fearing one of their own had been hit, Marysville Little League Secretary Diane Washburn told the paper.

'It wasn't one of our kids, just get back,' she recalled telling the swelling crowd, adding that her next priority was keeping children from seeing what had happened. 'Once they see that, that can't be unseen.'

People who were at the game told the Marysville Appeal-Democrat they heard a long blowing of the train's horn, much longer than usual.

'He honked from so far back there,' a concession stand volunteer told the paper.

Another said the engineer honked 'a bunch and a bunch and a bunch.'

Investigators were combing the scene for evidence well after dark, according to the paper.

The small town of about 12,000 was rocked by the incident.

'Marysville is a small but busy city,' said the fire department spokesperson. 'Everybody knows everybody so it was pretty traumatic.'

The Sadie Hawkins Day dance is a role-reversal that has girls asking boys on a date, and the teen girl walking with the deceased boy knew him well.

He said he knew the teenage girl, and said she had a close relationship to the boy.

'She's a sweetheart,' he added.

Washburn said that, despite the tragedy, Saturday's Little League games will still be played as scheduled.
