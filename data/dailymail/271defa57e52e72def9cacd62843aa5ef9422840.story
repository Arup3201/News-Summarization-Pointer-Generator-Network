It's the signature tune for the new season and the 50th anniversary edition of the Match of the Day titles featured many special moments from BBC's flagship football show.

It began with footage from the first ever broadcast in 1964, with Kenneth Wolstenholme introducing highlights of Liverpool's league game against Arsenal at Anfield.

 

Legends George Best, Alan Clarke and Liam Brady then showed off their skills in a seventies montage before David Coleman's crisp delivery of '1-0'.

Barry Davies' memorable commentary of 'look at his face, just look at his face' also featured along with Alan Hansen's memorable remark 'you can't win anything with kids'.

 

Paul Gascoigne, Eric Cantona, Thierry Henry and Sergio Aguero were the among the famous faces from the the past two decades.

And the 40 second clip culminated with Manchester City lifting the Premier League last season.
