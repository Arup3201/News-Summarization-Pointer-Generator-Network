A pharmaceuticals millionaire admitted in court Wednesday to killing her autistic 8-year-old son at a high-end Manhattan hotel, but told jurors she did not force drugs down his throat.

Taking the stand in her murder trial, Gigi Jordan tearfully described a failed murder-suicide — one her defense has said was spurred by a mother's fears for her own life and her developmentally challenged son's future.

‘Did you give yourself and your son an amount of drugs that you believed would take your life and his?’ asked one of her attorneys, Allan Brenner.

‘Yes, I did,’ Jordan said, her voice audibly shaking.

But she denied the scenario prosecutors have painted: that she climbed on top of the comatose 8-year-old Jude Mirra, punched him in the nose, pried open his mouth by force and shoved a lethal dose of prescription medication down his throat with a syringe.

‘In doing so, did you ever jab your elbow into his chest… inject liquefied drugs into his mouth, forcibly then pinch his nose and cover his mouth to force him to swallow those drugs?”

“No, I did not,’Jordan responded from the stand.

Jude was found dead of a drug overdose and Jordan was found on the floor in room 1603, a $2,300-a-night suite at Manhattan's five-star Peninsula Hotel on February 5, 2010.

More than 5,800 prescription pills, including anti-depressants, painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs, were scattered around the room, prosecutors said, according to CNN.

Some emergency responders have said they discovered Jordan incoherent; others described her as composed.

By the time Jude was found inside the hotel room he had been dead for 8-14 hours.

An autopsy revealed that the child was given a deadly cocktail of four painkiller and anti-inflammatory drugs, all washed down with Orange juice and vodka.

Standing trial: As Jude (right) lay dying on the bed next to her, Jordan (pictured, left, in court) then reportedly emailed adviser Patrick Walsh, saying: 'Hi Pat, can you please wire $125,000 to Bruce as requested below?'

'His fate was sealed,' prosecutor Matt Bogdanos said in opening statements. 'He didn't die fast. One by one, his vital organs shut down. It didn't take minutes. It took hours to die.' 

As he lay dying on the bed next to her, she then reportedly emailed adviser Patrick Walsh, saying: 'Hi Pat, can you please wire $125,000 to Bruce as requested below?'.

She hoped to siphon the large sum of cash from her son's trust fund into one of her business accounts, prosecutors said in court last month.

Jordan has always described her actions in the luxury hotel room on Fifth Avenue in February 2010 as a 'mercy killing,' but prosecutors said the pharmaceutical executive's emails contradicted her defense lawyer's assertions that she was 'emotionally distraught' at her son's autism.

Instead, Jordan wanted to live the life of the socialite and not be tied down by a young son who required so much attention because of his condition, said lead prosecutor Matthew Bogdanos.

The mother’s defense team have said she acted out of fear that her life was in danger and that her son would be left susceptible to abuse.

Prosecutors say that whatever her worries, they didn't justify killing the boy.

‘The only person he ever needed protection from was the one person he should have been able to rely on the most,’ Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Matthew Bodganos said in an opening statement last month.

Trained as a nurse, Jordan later launched companies that administer drugs to patients in their home. After making an estimated $40million, she left her career and traveled the country seeking medical answers for her son.

A joyous boy until roughly his 18th month, he became a tormented child who didn't speak, made strange grimaces, and screamed and cried, she said.

He was initially considered autistic, though doctors later diagnosed immune-system abnormalities, post-traumatic stress disorder and other problems, according to her court filings.

Jordan said Wednesday that Jude wasn't autistic; instead, she has said, he was severely traumatized by being sexually abused by his biological father, a yoga teacher, in 2007. The man has denied it and has never been charged with any crime.

Jordan asked various authorities to investigate but got nowhere — and she even once got taken instead to a hospital for a psychiatric evaluation, her lawyers say. She was released within days.

Meanwhile, she came to believe that one of her ex-husbands, Ray Mirra, wanted her dead to keep her from disclosing certain shady business dealings involving black-market pill sales, her defense says. He has denied all her allegations and has sued her for slander.

Afraid that Jude would be left unprotected against his father, she felt ending both their lives was the only way out, her lawyers have said.

Allegations: In addition to his medical condition, Jordan alleges that her son's (pictured) biological father, and her second husband, Emil Tzekov, had been sexually abusing the boy since he was an infant

During an earlier hearing, the court heard that Jordan balanced her checkbook after giving her son the lethal concoction of pills. 

The mother then reportedly attempted to take her own life by consuming a mixture of pills and Grey Goose vodka.

But she was foiled when members of law enforcement kicked down the door to the room and found her on the floor incoherent and babbling.

She immediately said to one officer, 'I want a lawyer', the court heard in September.  

Killing a person to save them from future abuse has never been a recognized defense to murder in the state of New York.  

 The trial is expected to last until November. If convicted, Jordan could face up to 15 years in prison.
