Mother-of-four Nicola Mendelsohn, 41, who is known for her insistence on working a four-day week, will take up the key Facebook post in July

She is the new poster girl for working mothers who insist it really is possible to 'have it all'.

Nicola Mendelsohn has just landed one of the biggest media roles in the world – but is likely to work only a four-day week so that she can spend more time with her husband and four children aged between eight and 16.

The 41-year-old British advertising executive has just been made Facebook's new vice-president for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

Although it has not been confirmed officially that she will be working a four-day week, industry insiders expect her to do so since this is a condition she has insisted on in the past.

Mrs Mendelsohn, who has forged a successful 15-year career working part-time, begins her role at the social media giant in July.

The Manchester-born executive – who calls herself 'a proper Northern lass' – will oversee a team of nearly 1,000, including around 150 in Facebook's Covent Garden office.

Mrs Mendelsohn married her husband Jon, 46, a lobbyist and former Labour party fundraiser, in 1994 and lives in a £1.3million house in Finchley, North London.

She is known and admired throughout the business community for her ability to rise to the top while also making time for her young family.

Her belief is that working from Monday to Thursday improves her work-life balance.

The appointment offers hope to women who feel torn between their careers and their families. Mrs Mendelsohn said recently: 'The industry has to more readily welcome back its best women. I would much rather hire a talented woman on four days a week than lose her forever.'

Her promotion will please Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, a passionate advocate of women in the workplace.

She recently published a book, Lean 
In, calling on successful women to 'lean in' to their careers instead of
 assuming that they – unlike their male peers – should scale down their 
commitments to make more time for their family responsibilities.

Mrs Mendelsohn, a close friend of 
Gordon Brown's wife Sarah, is currently executive chairman of 
advertising agency Karmarama where she has applied her philosophy on 
family life to her staff practices.

Around 65 per cent of the firm's 180 employees have laptops so they can work from home or elsewhere whenever they please.

Last night Facebook and Karmarama declined to comment on the question of Mrs Mendelsohn's working arrangements.
