Spending cuts and the high cost of living could force elderly people who live in the countryside to face their final years in poverty and isolation, a report has warned.

Gradual changes to the rural way of life are leaving those over 65 without infrastructure or support, the study found.

Poor access to social care, slow internet connections, cuts to local bus services and the closure of local shops and post offices are among the factors affecting their quality of life, it is claimed.

Bearing the brunt: An Age UK report claims over-65s living in rural areas are more adversely affected by spending cuts and the high cost of living compared to those living in urban areas

The report, published by charity Age UK, follows the Government’s admission that countryside communities have been failed by some decision-making, with ministers claiming that future policies will be ‘rural-proof’.

Over-65s living in rural areas are adversely affected by spending cuts and the high cost of living compared to those living in urban areas, the report claims.

The document, entitled Later Life In Rural England, says prices are up to 20 per cent higher in the countryside.

It found that 1.2 million people older than 50 in Britain are socially isolated, which it claims is as damaging to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

Describing rural life for the elderly as ‘tough’, the charity has called on the Government to consider the social impact of cutting services used by the elderly.

It found that one in four over-65s living in the countryside identified the lack of public transport as the biggest challenge they face.

Almost 600,000 leave their homes only once, or not at all, every week, the charity also found.

Connections: Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said elderly people in isolated communities could benefit from schemes such as the rollout of broadband to rural areas

The Department for the Environment is expected to publish a guide this month ordering ministers and officials to take account of rural communities when developing policies.

Environment Secretary Owen Patterson said: ‘If you’re an elderly person in a constituency like mine in rural Shropshire and you haven’t got a car, or you lose the ability to drive, you are at a disproportionate disadvantage.’

He pinpointed the rollout of broadband to rural areas as something that would be a ‘huge social gain for elderly people’.

Mr Patterson added: ‘The biggest thing we can do to people is to get broadband into our most remote communities.

‘The great thing about broadband is you can Skype your daughter in Sydney, and you can keep up with all the latest news, culture and sport online and do your shopping and play a valuable role in society.’

Michelle Mitchell, charity director of Age UK, said: ‘Life in rural England is very tough for many people. 

‘Too many are stranded at home, lonely and isolated, struggling to the shops, post office and even hospital, because of a lack of local bus services.

‘With rural communities ageing rapidly, it’s more critical than ever that the Government and local authorities make sure that the older people who live there, many of them frail and vulnerable, have access to the services and facilities they need to live as independent and fulfilling lives as possible.’

Victoria Harris from The Prince’s Countryside Fund said that the closure of rural shops and post offices is a ‘major issue’.
