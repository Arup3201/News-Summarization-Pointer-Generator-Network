A Florida woman turned herself in Wednesday after it was found that she was under the influence of booze, cocaine, meth and prescription pills when she allegedly hit a skateboarder as he crossed the street in February.

An arrest DUI manslaughter warrant had been issued for Jody Arcuri, 31, in the death of 22-year-old Stephen Michael Wilson.

While on a boozy cocktail of drugs--and, according to some witnesses, while also using her cell phone--police say Arcuri smashed into Wilson in South Daytona, killing him instantly, snapping his skateboard and sending his limp body flying through the air.

Changing look: 31-year-old Port Orange, Florida woman Jody Arcuri was arrested in February (left) after allegedly killing a 22-year-old skateboarder with her car while intoxicated. Test results this week revealed she was not only drunk but also high on cocaine, meth, and Valium. She turned herself into police on a DUI manslaughter charge Wednesday and had put on considerable weight

At the time of the accident, a visibly frazzled and confused Arcuri told police she'd blacked out just before the crash.

The Orlando Sentinel reported that witnesses told police she was texting or talking on her phone, however.

They saw Wilson's body tumble onto the hood of Arcuri's car, shatter the windshield and then break off a sideview mirror before flying into the air and finally coming to rest on the concrete.

Arcuri's vehicle came to a stop a short distance later.

Horrific: Witnesses said the 22-year-old Stephen Michael Wilson hit the hood, crashed into the windshield and then broke off the side view mirror  before going airborne

Dead on impact: Authorities say Wilson was killed upon impact

Wrenching: The 22-year-old's skateboard was found in pieces near the car

Police at 
the scene say they found a crack pipe that would test positive for 
cocaine, as well as marijuana and prescription drugs in Arcuri's car.

Arcuri consented to give blood and it tested positive for cocaine, methamphetamine, and the prescription drug valium.

She also had a blood alcohol level of 0.092, which was over the 0.08 limit.

Arcuri
 was being held on $50,000 bond after turning herself in Wednesday on 
the manslaughter charge, at which point she took a mugshot that showed 
her considerable weight gain since her initial arrest in February.

She was set to make a court appearance Thursday.

Erratic: Arcuri was seen flailing and thrashing while police questioned her but she nonetheless consented to give a blood sample at the scene

Witnesses said Arcuri's car drove a distance after hitting Wilson before coming to a halt. Police say there were no skid marks indicating she'd tried to brake at all prior to the impact
