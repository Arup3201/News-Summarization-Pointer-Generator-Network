15% of women said there partner realised their cheating ways by their varying mood swings, claiming their extreme moments of happiness were a dead giveaway. 

Unless she is genuinely swamped with her workload, being consistently late home from work is the number five mistake women make when they cheat. 9% of males found out about their partner's cheating due to their inability to contact their other half when they were late home from work. 

Rounding off the remaining five mistakes are a sudden trend in women concealing their feelings, being sarcastic or impassive towards their relationship, a loss of interest and affection in their partner, flirting with other men and the loss of a sexual appetite. 

Experts from Victoria Milan found that the results were in line with their predictions based on existing data. 

Rejecting sex with a partner is not an especially tell-tale sign for female cheaters because most men in all kinds of relationships report that they have higher sexual expectations from their relationship than do their female partners.   

Loss of interest in your partner, and a resulting lack of affection came in at eighth place on the list 

According to the Founder and CEO of Victoria Milan, Sigurd Vedal, the results give first time cheaters a good idea of how their behaviour can be interpreted. 

'While Victoria Milan can help protect your identity online – even redirecting the site to somewhere neutral when your partner walks in via a panic button – we can't guarantee your behaviour offline won't be suspicious,' Ms Vedal said.

'This invaluable advice from more experienced female cheaters will help new cheaters to avoid obvious tell-tale signs of adultery.'
