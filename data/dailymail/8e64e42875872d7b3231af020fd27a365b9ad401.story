England settled into their paradise city World Cup base, under the protection of the robocops deployed to ensure Brazil’s carnival of football unfolds in a safe environment.

The contrast could not have been clearer as Roy Hodgson and his team cruised by Rio de Janeiro’s golden sands in a team bus guarded by two police cars, a police motorcycle outrider, an army jeep and a truck-load of troops armed to the teeth.

A protection force of 15,000 will police the stadiums, hotels, airports and training camps, according to the media in a country long accustomed to violent crime and, in more recent months, civil unrest.

Adding to the mood, England have selected the Urca military centre as their base at the foot of Sugar Loaf Mountain and a submarine slunk silently beneath the waves by the  training pitch just as the players emerged yesterday.

Hodgson has been looking for an impact sub and he had one. The submarine was  followed by a gunship and helicopters  buzzing overhead on the first day’s training in Rio. Here was a stunning backdrop with armour plating.

It promises to be the theme of the tournament; the thrilling prospect of a World Cup in Brazil entwined with the ever-present threat. Here is modern Brazil; parties and pacification units, hand in hand.

Hodgson’s first session, however, was a friendly affair, starting with a welcome rendition of Queen’s We Are the Champions by samba band Bola Pra Frente, as the England players carried out a banner thanking Brazil for their ‘warm welcome’.

This was somewhat nicer than the phrase selected by coach Gary Neville to get rid of the TV crews who accosted him and others on a seafront stroll on Sunday.

England stars will be banking on support from their Twitter followers after FIFA confirmed that the official Man of the Match at World Cup games will be voted for on the social media site.

Football’s governing body and official World Cup sponsor Budweiser are hoping that taking the process to Twitter will increase the number of fans who vote during each game.

In 2010, the vote was only accessible on the FIFA website.

At this year’s tournament, the voting will open on Twitter at the start of the second half of each game, with fans able to click on a picture of their chosen player and register their vote via hashtag #ManoftheMatch.

Jack Wilshere and Adam Lallana made England’s presence felt in the favelas, the shanty towns clinging to the rocks which tower above the city, with a visit to a sports complex in Rochina, which overlooks the team hotel in Sao Conrado.

The England players, who always give their match fees to charities, have made a five-figure donation to renovate the dressing rooms in the sports complex, used by many youngsters from Rochina, Brazil’s biggest favela.

‘It is an eye-opener,’ said Wilshere. ‘In Brazil, like England, they love their football. Growing up I know all I wanted to do was play football. This will be nice for them.’

England players laboured in the heat of their one-hour session at Urca. Wayne Rooney looked exhausted from the start of his ball exercises and the fitness coaches and sports science experts sprayed the players with cold water during their drinks breaks.

Both Steven Gerrard and Wilshere slipped out of the main group to work alone with the fitness coaches. The manager looked on, wearing his white baseball cap and retro shades.

Assistant manager Ray Lewington hobbled around the perimeter with his left knee heavily bandaged after a minor operation on Friday.

Gerrard is nursing slight discomfort in his groin and Wilshere went to work on the spinning bikes in a shady marquee but he was quick to quash any concerns.

‘It was just really to get the flight out my legs,’ said the Arsenal midfielder. ‘I feel I’m getting stronger every game. Ideally, I’d prefer a few more games.

‘We know what we’re going to face. This is the biggest competition in the world. Teams want to win and they are not going to let you walk past them. They are going to put their foot in and we have to get ready for that.

‘I’ve had a few kicks and when I first came back I was worried but I can’t stop it. I’ve been kicked many times and carried on.’

Ross Barkley was simply delighted to be involved after he turned up late. The bus had already left the team hotel when they noticed Barkley was missing and they caused chaos in the street turning the coach around.

When he finally climbed aboard he was greeted with a sarcastic cheer and the team made the journey in 39 minutes with the help of their military convoy.

On the return: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is working his way back to full fitness

Better signs for Hodgson came in the shape of Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, who had further treatment on his injured knee before going through a light running and jogging session, carefully monitored by physios Gary Lewin and Steve Kemp.

The Ox, wearing a heavy knee brace as he worked, started with some short dashes, not at full throttle, and finished with a few laps of the pitch.

Hodgson has until Friday to make up his mind on whether to keep him in the squad but the progress appears to be encouraging.

Some of the players, including Frank Lampard, Raheem Sterling, Luke Shaw and Barkley were still out doing shooting practice when Hodgson came out and ordered them off.

The first training session beneath Sugar Loaf Mountain lasted just over an hour, which was more than enough in the midday sun.
