Police in Denver are failing to make the desperate search for a 53-year-old father who disappeared at half-time during a Broncos football game on Thursday a priority, the woman who took him to the stadium claimed on Monday.

Tia Bakke, who has been desperately hunting for Paul Kitterman, told MailOnline: 'He's now been missing for four days and we have had absolutely no leads whatsoever. But police don't consider it a priority.

'They say he is an adult and there is no sign of foul play so there is nothing much they can do,' she added. 'I am trying to maintain a positive, hopeful attitude, but I am very, very worried.'

Worried sick: Jarod Tonneson has spent the past four days giving out fliers in a desperate bid to locate his missing father 

The Denver Police Department has issued a missing person's alert for Kitterman, describing him as 5ft. 7in. and weighing 190 lb.

'Paul Kitterman was last seen at about 8:00pm on Thursday, 10-23-14,' the alert says. 'He was wearing a dark colored hoody sweatshirt and Broncos ball cap.'

A spokesperson for the Denver Police Department told MailOnline Monday morning that Kitterman's disappearance remains an active missing persons case, but they do not have any leads and they do not suspect foul play at this time.

Kitterman, who is unmarried and lives alone in Kremmling, was at his first ever professional football game when he vanished. 

Bakke and her boyfriend Jay Yust - for whom Kitterman has worked for the last 10 years - had invited him to go to last Thursday's crunch AFC West face-off against the San Diego Chargers along with his 21-year-old son Jarod Tonneson.

'We are regulars, we are not season ticket holders, but this was the fourth Broncos game we have been to this season, and we have taken other friends with us before,' said Bakke. 'But Paul had never been to a game.'

The friends couldn't get seats together so Bakke and Yust sat in one section of the Sports Authority Field at Mile High while Kitterman and his son went to another. 

Priorities: 'They say he is an adult and there is no sign of foul play so there is nothing much they can do,' Bakke told MailOnline. 'I am trying to maintain a positive, hopeful attitude, but I am very, very worried'

The foursome met up at half time when the Broncos were leading 14-7 — but that is the last time that Kitterman, who works on Yust's MY Ranch in Kremmling, Colorado, was seen.

'He was super-excited about the game. It was the first time he had been and the Broncos were ahead and playing well,' Bakke, 24, told MailOnline. 'Jarod needed to use the restroom and we left Paul waiting outside for him - it couldn't have been more than 10 feet from where we had been standing.'

But when Jarod came out, his father was nowhere to be found so he went back to his seat in the south bleachers to watch the second half of the game, assuming he would soon join him.

When the game ended in a 35-21 Bronco victory around 9.30 pm, Bakke called Tonneson telling him she and her 30-year-old boyfriend were waiting at Gate 8 ready for the two-hour drive back to Kremmling.

'He said he was waiting for Paul and asked me if he was with us, I said "no, I thought he was with you".'

Mystery: Kitterman - pictured with Jarod at the game - did not have his cell phone or his credit cards with him when he vanished, Bakke said  

For nearly three frantic hours the trio searched the 13-year-old, 76,000-capacity stadium with no luck. They called the police, local hospitals, even jails and detox facilities in the hope that someone could give them a lead.

Tonneson told Denver's Fox affiliate, KDVR-TV he and his friends had looked in 'parking lots, trees, bushes, anywhere we could think of'.

Eventually they left for the long journey home, hoping against hope that Paul would be waiting for them when they returned to Kremmling. Bakke called the frustrating days following the game 'the longest, most miserable days of her life'.

In the ensuing days the mystery of Paul Kitterman's disappearance has only grown with no-one able to give any hint as to what happened to him. He did not have either his cell phone or credit cards with him, Bakke said.

'There is no way Paul would have deliberately disappeared,' Bakke told MailOnline. 'It is just not in his personality.

There were no known medical problems or drug use in Paul's past that would lead him to disappear suddenly, said Bakke.

She continued: 'He has worked for Jay for something like 10 years and he is extremely reliable. Paul is the most trustworthy person you could ever wish to meet.

'He would hate the fuss that is growing up around his disappearance. Paul is just not the type of person who would do something like this for attention.

'He would never deliberately let anyone worry about him, that is just not who he is,' she added. 'He never wants stress or heartache or anything like that. He is the type of person that if you are having a bad day will do anything he can to be there for you. 

Missing: Bakke told MailOnline that Kitterman said that it was uncharacteristic of him to disappear. She said he's 'extremely reliable. Paul is the most trustworthy person you could ever wish to meet' 

Vanished: Kitterman worked at a ranch owned by the friends he went to the game with. Bakke said: 'He would hate the fuss that is growing up around his disappearance' 

'All he wants in his whole life is for everyone to be happy. He would never do anything to hurt anyone - especially his son. Jarod is just beside himself. There are no words to describe what he is going through. He is at a complete loss.'

As for Bakke, she has no clue as to what could have happened to her friend. 'If he had somehow fallen they would have found him. If he gotten himself into a fight and got arrested there would be a record, same if he had ended up in hospital,' she said.

'We just have no idea what could possibly have happened to him.'
