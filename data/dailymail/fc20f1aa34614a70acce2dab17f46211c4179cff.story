The NHS has spent nearly £350,000 on removing tattoos after people changed their minds about their body art.

More than 2,000 people have been given free laser treatment – courtesy of the taxpayer – in the past four years, described by MPs as a ‘sheer waste’ of scarce NHS funds.

Tattoo removal is not routinely provided by the NHS, but guidance states it can be carried out ‘to protect a person’s health’ if their doctor believes it is causing them ‘significant distress or serious mental health problems’.

It would also be considered if the dye had caused a ‘significant allergic reaction or infection’ or if someone had been tattooed against their will. A patient must be referred by their GP.

Figures obtained by The Sun under Freedom of Information laws show 2,016 people had tattoos removed since 2010 at a cost of £330,182. However, the true cost is likely to be much higher, as many trusts did not provide breakdowns of the reasons for laser treatments.

The number of tattoo parlours in the UK has soared from about 50 in the 1970s to 1,000 today.

Their popularity has been boosted by celebrity fans, including David Beckham and Cheryl Fernandez-Versini. Even the Prime Minister’s wife, Samantha Cameron, has a small dolphin tattoo on her ankle.

However, four in ten people are said to regret having a tattoo and one in six want them removed.

Laser removal uses beams of different coloured light to break down the ink into minuscule fragments, which can then be absorbed into the bloodstream and excreted via the liver and digestive system.

Private clinics charge around £150 a session for a small tattoo and up to £800 for a larger one. Typically eight to ten sessions are needed for large tattoos.

One patient to benefit was John, 22, who had a large swastika removed from his chest and hoped to have other Nazi symbols removed from his back and arms. He told the BBC he wanted them removed so he could move abroad and take his top off while working out.

He added: ‘You can’t really do that with something that is going to offend everybody... I want to move on in life. If I got them removed I’d be able to change my image.’

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers will be furious that they’re funding what amounts to cosmetic surgery. You can’t go a day in politics without someone calling for more money for the NHS, but it’s clear that too much is already wasted.

‘With Britain’s finances so stretched we have to prioritise spending on essential services, not on covering up ill-advised body art.’

Shadow health minister Andrew Gwynne said: ‘People will struggle to see how this sheer waste of precious NHS money can be justified when hospitals do not have enough staff.

‘Patient care is already heading downhill and more nurses could be lost under Tory spending cuts.’
