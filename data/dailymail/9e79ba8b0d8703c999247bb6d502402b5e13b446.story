Companies and individuals outside of the media industry are being investigated as part of a criminal investigation into hacking, Scotland Yard has confirmed.

However, the Metropolitan Police said it does not 'recognise' reports that it holds a list of 200 private detective clients that directly feature in ongoing criminal investigations.

A statement from the police force was released as pressure mounts on the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) and MPs to release the names of hundreds of companies and individuals who may have used rogue private investigators to steal personal information.

However, Scotland Yard said it 'will not 
risk prejudicing future potential prosecutions or compromising our 
responsibilities as a public authority and data controller by releasing 
details of individuals or companies where there is no intelligence or 
evidence that they were associated with the criminal conduct of a 
private investigator they had employed'.

Last week, officers gave MPs a list of 102 firms and individuals – including a global celebrity and FTSE 100 firm – who hired detective agencies accused of hacking, blagging and stealing private information.

But the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) has now admitted it is holding a further list of 200 clients that was not turned over to the Home Affairs Select Committee.

The news means the use of corrupt investigators by law firms, banks, insurance companies and celebrities in the so-called ‘hidden’ hacking scandal is far more serious than was thought.

Yesterday investigative news agency Exaro said it had seen the list, and revealed HM Revenue & Customs, BT and British Gas were all targeted by private investigators.

It included obtaining details of income and tax paid by individuals, as well as bank account details of British Gas customers and whether phone lines were linked to specific addresses from BT.

It total more than 300 companies and individuals could be involved in so-called ‘blue chip’ hacking where private data may have been gathered illegally by private snoops.

Later this week Home Secretary Theresa May is expected to announce that private investigators will be regulated for the first time.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs select committee, has now written to the chief executives of various regulators to ask for clarification on what guidelines, if any, they issue to organisations in their industry on the use of private investigators.

He said: ‘The context in which the companies implicated by Soca's information have acted is crucial for us to understand their motives.

‘By understanding whether an organisation has conducted their business within their regulator's guidelines gives a clear indication of their ethical standpoint.

‘Without the names the public are currently left impotent in their judgment. It is important we try to gain as much assurance as possible on their behalf.’

The list of regulators contacted includes the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), The Law Society, ICAEW, Security Industry Association (SIA), Office of Fair Trading, BVRLA, Office of Rail Regulation and Financial Conduct Authority.

The Soca report released today in an unredacted form appears to suggest much of the information accessed unlawfully by private detectives was done so for some of Britain's most high-profile businesses.

HMRC, BT and British Gas are now revealed as some of the victims.

An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We take the protection of customer data extremely seriously so we constantly review our processes and procedures in light of developments in the e-security world, together with the expert technical and strategic advice we receive from our advisors and in-house teams. For reasons you will understand we cannot go into more detail.’

A spokesman for BT said: ‘BT takes its responsibility to protect customer data very seriously and will not tolerate misuse of its systems or inappropriate or unauthorised access.

‘For this reason, BT ensures that user access can be tracked so that any misuse may be detected, and offenders can be dealt with appropriately.’

A Home Office spokeswoman said: ‘We expect law enforcement agencies to take tough action against criminal behaviour wherever it is identified.

‘Ministers will shortly be announcing plans to regulate private investigators.’
