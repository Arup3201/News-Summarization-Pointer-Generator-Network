Head of Ofsted Sir Michael Wilshaw, who is considering feasibility of stopping notice for school inspections 

Forty schools are to face lightning Ofsted inspections as part of a wide-ranging crackdown on extremism, declining standards and classroom indiscipline.

Inspectors are planning ‘no notice’ visits to prevent schools trying to hastily cover up weaknesses to fool watchdogs.

About 40 schools across the country will be targeted in the next two weeks, in the wake of the alleged ‘Trojan Horse’ plot by hardline Muslims to infiltrate schools in Birmingham.

Heads are currently given around half a day’s notice of an inspection, but the Prime Minister called for Ofsted to consider scrapping this warning.

Sir Michael Wilshaw, head of Ofsted, said he was still considering the feasibility of stopping notice for all school inspections.

But in the meantime, he ordered regional chiefs to make more use of current powers, which mean schools over which there is ‘concern’ can face snap inspections.

Some schools being targeted are due for an Ofsted check anyway, but others are suspected of having problems including poor behaviour or leadership.

Teaching unions last night criticised the plans. Russell Hobby, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said zero notice inspections ‘demonstrate a profound lack of trust in school leaders’.

Sir Michael also disclosed that Ofsted inspectors had returned to the five schools put in special measures following its Trojan Horse probe.

Sir Michael himself last week joined the inspection team at one of these schools, Park View Academy, where he met the acting executive principal and the trustees to check on its progress. The outcome of the visits will be published shortly.

The Park View Academy in Birmingham, which was investigated as part of allegations into the Trojan Horse plot 

Four separate probes were conducted into the so-called Trojan Horse allegations following the publication of a mystery letter purporting to outline a plot by radicals to seize control of schools.

Schools placed in special measures following Ofsted’s inquiry – one of the four probes - were Golden Hillock School, Nansen Primary School and Park View Academy - all run by the Park View Educational Trust, and Oldknow Academy and Saltley School. 

A sixth, Alston Primary, was already in special measures.
