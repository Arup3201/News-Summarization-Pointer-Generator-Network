The Queen has opened a new primary school in a Welsh village devastated by a horrific mining disaster - marking a poignant return to the site still haunted by the tragedy after 46 years.

A total of 144 people, including 116 children, lost their lives when a coal waste tip slid down a mountain, engulfing a school and surrounding houses in Aberfan in 1966.

Today, in a show of her continuing support for the former mining community, Her Majesty unveiled a plaque at Ynysowen Community Primary School during the second and final day of her Diamond Jubilee visit to Wales.

Since the disaster, which all but 
wiped out an entire generation of the community’s schoolchildren, the 
Queen has visited the village three times.

During today's visit, a survivor of the disaster led the Queen on a tour of the new school.Jeff Edwards was aged eight when he became the last person to be pulled still alive from the rubble of his school.

Almost half a century later he is the leader of Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council.

He proudly showed the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh around Ynsyowen Community Primary School, which is said to symbolise a fresh generation of hope for the valley villagers.

'I asked the Queen to come here and open the new school because it represents a new generation of young people in the community,' Mr Edwards said today.

'The Queen has been very, very supportive of Aberfan and has been to the village four times.

'This school is a symbol of the regeneration of the community but today is also a time for us to look to the past.'

He added: 'It is very emotional for all of us here today. We will be looking back on the friends we lost.

'It is also a day of celebration in that we are looking at the regeneration of the community.'

He also described how surviving the devastation of the collapse as a child had shaped his outlook on life.

'It has given me that motivation and drive to come into public service and to make something for the people who were not so fortunate as myself,' he said.

The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were greeted by hundreds of children waving Union flags as they arrived at the eco-friendly school.

The timber-framed building has a concave roof which collects water for flushing toilets at the school.

Walls are insulated with recycled newspaper and solar panels heat the school's water.

Earlier they had listened to a rousing musical rendition by a school samba band.

The royal couple were then taken off to meet a number of other survivors of the disaster who were at the school today.

Among them was David Davies, who was also aged eight and a pupil at the school when it was engulfed by coal waste tip.

He went on to move away and become a solicitor but has since returned to the community.

He met the Queen today and went on to speak about how his experience had coloured his life.

'I would say that it makes you take 
stock and look at life in a way different to someone who has not 
experienced it. You count your blessings,' he said.

Later the royal couple separated briefly and spoke with guests individually.

The Duke of Edinburgh was offered a Welsh cake after being assured that they were delicious.

'No, thank you. I have just had my breakfast,' he was heard to reply.

The Queen spoke briefly with Craig White, the architect responsible for designing the school.

'I explained that the school had an 
upside-down roof which collects all the rain water and the children can 
flush the toilets here using rain water. They really like that,' he 
said.

'She said that we were never going to be short of water in Wales,' he added.

Outside children waited in the rain with Union flags for an extra glimpse of the royal couple.

Fionne Richards, five, was among many excited youngsters vigorously waving her flag at the Queen.

'She is very nice. I am happy she is here. She reminds me of my grandmother,' she said.

After opening the school, where they were cheered by dozens of pupils and staff, the royal convoy headed eastward to Ebbw Vale.

Hundreds turned out in the Welsh valleys town where Her Majesty attended two engagements.

After
the royal couple met former steel workers and museum volunteers at a 
newly-refurbished works general office and archives, they were the 
guests of honour at a thanksgiving service in Christ Church.

Scores of schoolchildren, braving the wind and rain, lined the streets waving Union and Welsh flags.

Inside
more than 500 worshippers heard Geoff Waggett give thanks to God for 
The Queen and her pivotal role as 'defender of the faith'.

The monarch gave a speech to the gathered and excited congregation in a marquee at the side of the church.

She said: 'Prince Philip and I are delighted to be here with you in Ebbw Vale this afternoon.

'You have been witnesses to many of the greatest changes in Wales of recent years.

'My family has been coming here since the height of the Valleys’ industrial might.

'After
the closure of the steelworks a decade ago, we have admired the 
fortitude and resilience of Ebbw Vale as you have tackled the social and
economic struggle that followed.

'I have travelled the length and 
breadth of this country during my 60 years as your Queen. Prince Philip 
and I have shared many of the joys and sadnesses of the Welsh people in 
that time and have always been struck by your sense of pride and your 
undimmed optimism.

'That remarkable spirit of Wales has been very evident in this valley today.'

After speaking to 101-year-old local 
resident Maud Baskerville outside the church, the Queen delighted the 
crowd as she went on a walkabout, taking time to stop and speak with 
delighted townspeople.

Royal fans either side of the barrier
on Church Street - and leaning out of windows in nearby homes - 
excitedly took photos before the Queen left Ebbw Vale in her Bentley 
state limousine.

After a short car ride, the Queen and
the Duke took to the skies in the royal helicopter as they made their 
way to their next appointment in Crickhowell.

The royal visit will be 
crowned with a Diamonds in the Park festival in Glanusk Park, a festival
of rural activities and sports.

Yesterday, the monarch was given a rapturous welcome on the first leg of her Welsh tour.

As
well as meeting Wales’ Grand Slam-winning rugby team at Margam Park, 
she attended a service at Cardiff's Llandaff Cathedral before flying to 
Cyfarthfa Castle - where they spoke with famous fashion designer Julien 
MacDonald.

Royalists expressed their delight at the visit, although republicans yesterday staged two peaceful protests calling for the end of the monarchy.

Last night, South Wales Police said they had arrested two people although praised the public for their co-operation.
