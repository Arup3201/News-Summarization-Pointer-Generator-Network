Secret: Joe Paterno's will and testament will not be revealed to the public

The last will and testament of Joe Paterno has been ordered permanently sealed from public view along with all related court filings at the request of a family attorney.

The judge's order and petition by a Paterno attorney requesting the action were also sealed.

County records indicate that Paterno's was the only will sealed in the county in the past 18 months.

A family spokesman said today that the step was intended to preserve 'a measure of privacy' for the family and was 'not an unusual request for high-profile individuals'.

The coach, who had a record-breaking 
409 victories in more than four decades at Penn State, died from lung 
cancer in January at age 85, months after he was ousted by 
the school's board of trustees following the explosive child sex abuse 
allegations against retired assistant coach Jerry Sandusky.

The ruling came as Sandusky's trial was due to begin this week. He 
is charged with 52 counts relating to child sex abuse.

The seven women and five men on the jury who will hear opening statements on Monday.

On
April 5, Paterno's will entered probate, the legal process for validating the
document, and estate attorney Raymond Parker petitioned to keep the 
matter secret on the same day. Four days later, a judge ordered the 
record sealed.

The decision was 'very strange', said Wilkes-Barre attorney Jerry Chariton, who has worked on estate law cases for four decades.

'Would
there be reasons why any family would like to preserve confidentiality?
Sure, but that would be true of lots of people,' Chariton said. 'I 
don't know what creates any special situation here.'

The paper said court officials could 
not determine which of the county's five judges ordered the Paterno will
and case file sealed.

Judge
Thomas Kistler, who as president judge oversees the county courts 
system, didn't return messages left at his chambers and home. Parker 
also didn't return telephone and email messages.

Family spokesman Dan McGinn said todayÂ  
that the step was recommended by the estate attorney 'in an attempt to 
preserve a measure of privacy for the family'.

'This is not an unusual request for high-profile individuals, and all parties to the will and the judge readily agreed to the request,' Mr McGinn said.

The Paterno family has been totally transparent with 'respect to Coach Paterno's contract and pension. Sue Paterno has also reiterated her commitment to support charitable causes connected to Penn State and the State College community. These efforts will continue'.

Only a court docket sheet remained public record and provided limited details about the former coach's will, wealth and estate.

Paterno completed his last will and testament in June 1997 and filed an amendment in February 2010, naming his wife, Sue, as executor.

The estate paid a $200,000 inheritance tax on April 23. The paper said that depending on the applicable rate, the taxable portion of Paterno's estate at the time of the tax payment was worth between $1.35 million to $4.45 million.

Other details came from Penn State and the state employees retirement system. On April 19, the university paid Paterno's estate more than $3 million in salary, television and radio revenue sharing, bonuses and death benefits.

The university also said it would forgive $350,000 in unspecified outstanding loans and debt incurred by the Paternos.

On May 22, the state retirement system said Paterno left his wife his $13.4million in pension benefits. McGinn said at the time that she would give $1.5million to charity, including $500,000 to the Suzanne Pohland Paterno Catholic Student Faith Center.

The former coach for years sidestepped questions about his salary, and state officials declined requests to reveal his compensation until late in his career.

In 2007, a court ordered the Pennsylvania State Employees' Retirement System to disclose Paterno's base salary of $512,664, saying it was a public record.
