Emergency services have been left red faced after being led on a wild goose chase following two hoax distress calls, about a plane that had crashed because of faulty landing gear.

It's believed a man, called up the Brisbane air traffic control centre just before noon on Monday and pretended he was a pilot before proceeding to tell operators there were problems with his equipment on board.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported the man's voice was slow and slurred in the recording of communication obtained by Fairfax Media.

The controller was heard trying to keep the unknown man calm, before advising him to try to land at the Sunshine coast where emergency personnel would be waiting.

A man called the Brisbane air traffic control centre (pictured) pretending to be a pilot claimed he was about to crash because of faulty landing gear. After hours of searching for the plane emergency services discovered the call was a hoax

The distressing call caused a frantic rush from police and emergency services, to locate the supposed plane or wreckage, including a rescue helicopter and even commercial airlines, including a Singapore airlines plane (pictured) to look out for any sign of the aircraft

But the recording suddenly got heated with the man claiming he had a warning in his engine.

'Not good. I've got a fire warning, it's getting difficult to fly,' said the man.

'We're gone, tell them I love them, we're gone.'

The distressing call caused a frantic rush from police and emergency services, to locate the supposed plane or wreckage, including a rescue helicopter and even commercial airlines to look out for any sign of the aircraft.

The Australian Maritime Safety Authority have said they passed the information onto the Queensland police to investigate

After hours of searching for the apparent plane and wreckage, nothing was found.

But controllers did however get another strange call, this time from a pilot flying another plane named 'Wedgetail' according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

It's believed the man, who tried to change his identity, was in fact the same man who made the first call and proceeded to tell operators that he was searching for the wreckage of the plane.

'We have got contact of interest, a boat, and are watching it very closely,' he said.

But by this time authorities were ignoring the call, aware that it was in fact another hoax call. 

It's believed the Australian Maritime Safety Authority have passed information onto the Queensland police to investigate. 

Last month Queensland police issued a media release saying that the Queensland emergency services often receive hoax calls or prank calls.

They said the valuable time spent attending the calls places a huge drain on resources. 

The release also said 'while Emergency Services are attending your prank call, somewhere someone else could be losing the valuable time they need to get assistance.'

It reminds people that hoax calls to emergency services is an offence.
