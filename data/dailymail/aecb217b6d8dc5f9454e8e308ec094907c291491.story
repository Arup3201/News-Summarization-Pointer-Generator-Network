Two men have been arrested on suspicion of historic sex offences as part of the investigation sparked by the allegations against shamed DJ Jimmy Savile.

The suspects, aged 64 and 74, were arrested separately today at two different addresses in south London.

Scotland Yard said tonight that both men were bailed until early January 2014 pending further inquiries.

Arrests: Two more people have been arrested as part of Operation Yewtree, which was set up in response to the crimes of Jimmy Savile, pictured

They are the 15th and 16th people arrested as part of the Metropolitan Police's Operation Yewtree.

The investigation was set up last year after it emerged that Savile had got away with abusing dozens of children over the decades before his death in 2011.

It has been divided into three strands - allegations involving only Savile, claims relating to Savile and other people, and those involving only others.

The two men arrested today are being held in connection with allegations from the 'others' strand of the investigation.

Suspect: David Smith, a former BBC chauffeur, has been found dead shortly before he was due to face trial

Many of the other people arrested as part of Operation Yewtree have been high-profile figures from the world of entertainment.

They include Dave Lee Travis, Max Clifford and Rolf Harris, all of whom are set to stand trial on charges of historic sex offences.

Comedian Jim Davidson was also arrested under Operation Yewtree, but was later told he would not face any charges.

Yesterday David Smith, a former BBC driver and convicted paedophile, was found dead at his London home on the day he was due to appear in court over allegations related to Yewtree.

He is thought to have killed himself on the eve of his trial.
