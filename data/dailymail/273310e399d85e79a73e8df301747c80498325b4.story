Accused: Dustin Kent, 36, allegedly raped a 13-year-old relative as her father watched

The uncle of missing Alabama teenager Brittney Wood raped a 13-year-old relative as her father watched, a police detective has testified in court.

Dustin Kent, who stands accused of sodomy and sexual abuse in multiple cases, is just one of Brittney's five relatives arrested on sex charges since her disappearance in May.

Police say that the charges do not relate to the missing 19-year-old, who left behind her two-year-old daughter. Her uncle, Donnie Holland, shot himself with her gun just two days after she vanished.

On Monday, Sgt. Scott Congleton from the Mobile police testified at a preliminary hearing in Mobile County District Court that the rape committed by Kent took place in 2008 when the girl was 13.

The victim, now 17, only came forward earlier this year amid the search for Brittney and her claims were 'credible', Congleton said.

He recounted her ordeal, explaining the girl's father lured her with the promise of going to a pet store to buy a hamster - but instead, they drove to Kent's workplace, the Mobile Register reported.

Kent, 36, joined them in the car and they drove to a run-down industrial park as it became darker.

As they were driving, the girl complained that she had a headache and Kent rubbed her head, Congleton said. He started to kiss her but she pushed him away, he added.

When the car pulled over, Kent took off her clothes and performed a sex act on her before raping her as her father watched, Congleton testified.

'She kept telling him to stop. He did not,' the detective said.

At the hearing, the judge concluded 
that prosecutors had enough evidence to send the rape and sodomy charges
 against Kent to a grand jury.

Kent has been freed on bail but cannot contact the victim or children younger than 16.

Police have downplayed any connection 
between Brittney's disappearance and the charges against her 
relatives. Assistant District Attorney Nicki Patterson said it remains 
under investigation.

Cousins in crime: Their son, Donald Holland Jr. (left), was charged with raping a 12-year-old girl, while his cousin, and the brother of Brittney Wood, Derek Wood, was also charged in the same incident

The young mother vanished on May 30 after saying that she planned to visit her uncle, Donnie Holland, in Baldwin County, but she has not been seen since.

Two days later, Holland shot himself in the head with what police later learned was Brittney's gun.

His suicide came as he, too, was under investigation for molestation, and he killed himself just half an hour before he was being interviewed by detectives, police said.

But while he escaped the investigation, five of his other relatives and one family friend have not. The five relatives are Brittney's brother, cousin, aunt and two uncles - including Kent.

Most recently, her aunt and Donnie Holland's wife, 33-year-old Wendy Holland, was arrested and charged with one count of endangering the welfare of a child.

Wendy Holland's two young children, who are in grade school, were handed over to the Department of Human Resources after her arrest on October 17, authorities said.

In a bizarre twist in the case of missing teenage mother Brittney Wood, her brother (Derek Wood), cousin (Donald Holland Jr.), aunt (Wendy Holland), and two uncles, (Dustin Kent and Randall Scott Wood), have been arrested on sex abuse charges in separate cases.

Donald Holland Sr.,
the husband of Wendy Holland and father of Donald Holland Jr., was also under investigation for sex abuse
 when he shot himself following Brittney's disappearance.

Wendy Holland and Randall Scott Wood are her mother's siblings. Dustin Kent is married to another of her mother's siblings.

Her stepson, Donald Holland Jr., also stands accused of raping a 12-year-old girl in January 2011.

Brittney's brother Derek Wood, 22, has been arrested for rape and sodomy, and allegedly had sex with the same 12-year-old.

Another uncle - her mother's brother - Randall Scott Wood, was arrested on June 19 on charges of incest, sodomy and sexual abuse - the same day Kent and Donnie Holland Sr. were arrested.

Kent is the brother-in-law of Brittney's mother; he is married to Wendy Holland's twin sister, Mendy.

In addition to the family arrests, Donnie Holland's friend, William Brownlee, was arrested on July 22 for second-degree sodomy and for having sex with the 12-year-old girl.

Police said they anticipate even more arrests in the sex-abuse investigation, which they carried out over three months.

Where is she? Police say the disappearance of Brittney Wood, whose brother, cousin, aunt and two uncles have been arrested for different sex charges, is not related to the cases

Justice: Kent appeared at Mobile County District court on Monday and his charges will go to a grand jury

There has been no sign of Brittney since she went to her uncle's house on May 30, and at first relatives thought she might have run away.

'We as a family do not see how she had 
the means to run,' her mother Chessie Wood said. 'We've covered every friend, every one of them are 
accounted for,' Mrs Woods said.

'I mean if she had to run because she's that scared, I would really believe that she would have [taken] her daughter with her.'

Of Donnie Holland's suicide, she said: 'It just really does not look good that she went missing May 30 and two days later he commits suicide.'
