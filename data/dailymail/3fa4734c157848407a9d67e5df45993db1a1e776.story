The adoptive father of an Ethiopian teen has blamed his wife for the girl's hypothermia and starvation death in order to get a lighter sentence, it emerged today.

Larry Williams and his wife Carri were found guilty of manslaughter last month after their adopted daughter Hana was found frozen and starved to death outside their Washington home in May 2011 when the temperature was just 40F.

The couple will be sentenced next week for her death and the abuse of their son Immanuel, who was also adopted from Ethiopia.

On Friday Larry Williams said through his attorney that his wife should spend decades in jail because 'she was the primary actor' in all of the treatment of Hana and Immanuel.

Outside court: Williams is asking for a five-year sentence after being convicted of the manslaughter of his adopted daughter - which means he could be out in three years

Hana Williams was found frozen and starved to death in the yard of her adoptive parents' Washington home in 2011. They were given maximum sentences today for causing her death

The lawyer filed a motion in court to get him out of jail quickly. He faces 14 to 19 years in prison for his part in the gruesome death of Hana, who died in the backyard of the 
couple's home, where she was forced to stay as part of a strict system 
of child-rearing outlined in a Christian parenting book.

An autopsy showed that Hana died of hypothermia that was aggravated by chronic gastritis and malnutrition.

Her bone-thin body was covered in 
bruises, including a lump on her shaved head, and red bloody markings on her
 hips, elbows and face.

Williams' attorney is asking a judge for a short five-year sentence, KIROTV reports, arguing that he was away working at Boeing while Carri, a stay-at-home mom, beat the adopted pair and fed them frozen food.

Carri Williams said her husband was aware of everything that went on in the home. She faces up to 37 years in prison.

During their trial, both Immanuel and one of the Williams' biological children testified against the couple.

Dragged away: Carri Williams is taken into custody last month after a jury deemed her guilty of the 2011 death of her daughter. She was also found guilty of homicide by abuse

The jury was unable to decide if Larry Williams was guilty of homicide by abuse. In the end, only Carri Williams was convicted on that charge.

Both Larry and Carri were also convicted of first degree assault on Hana's adopted brother Immanuel.

Tests on Hana's teeth and bones gave varying 
estimates and experts were unable to agree on her age.

Her age was significant because the homicide by abuse charge applies only if the victim was younger than 16, though experts were unable to say for sure if she was or was not.

She was adopted in 2008.

A foster mother testified during the trial that the couple's other adopted son Immanuel
 was rail-thin and covered in scratches when she took him in.

The
 testimony from Sheila Jackson came on day 18 of the Williams murder trial.

The
 couple left their 13-year-old Hana, to 
starve and die in the cold after brutally punishing her and 
her step-brother, Immanuel.

Jackson,
 who is deaf, told the jury in a Mount Vernon courtroom that when the 
Williamses’ son Immanuel, who was also adopted from Ethiopia, came to 
live with her, she could barely keep up with his demands for food.

'He ate fast. He ate a lot. He ate more than I expected,' she told on the stand, the station KIRO-TV reported

Following the couple's arrest, Child Protective Services removed Immanuel and seven other children from their home.

Sheila Jackson said the boy was terrified to talk about his adoptive parents.

According to the foster mother, the child was so emaciated that his ribs were showing through his skin covered in markings from past beatings.

Immanuel, now 12 years old, testified during the trial that the Williamses beat him and Hana with belts and switches.

The parents kept the family isolated from non-relatives, home-schooled the children and followed strict religious principles described in the Christian parenting book titled ‘To Train Up a Child,’ investigators said.

As punishment for bad behavior, the teen told the court that he and his step-sister were fed frozen meals, hosed down and forced to sleep in closets, where they would listen to recordings of the Bible on tape and Christian music. 

The defense has attempted to paint Immanuel as a disobedient boy with an attitude problem.

The lawyers for the couple said Immanuel hit and bit Jackson’s daughter so badly that her teacher ended up calling CPS after the child came to school with bruises.

Sheila Jackson said that Immanuel has been getting counseling and his behavior has been improving.

In 2008, Immanuel was seven-years-old when the American couple, both devout Christians, adopted him and Hana from Ethiopia.

Larry worked at Boeing while his wife was a stay-at-home mom home-schooling the two adopted kids and their seven biological children.

In his testimony, the 12-year-old told the court that his adopted parents would beat him with a stick until blood was running down his face.

Other disciplinary measures included having Immanuel hosed down in the yard for bed-wetting and keeping him and Hana outside in the cold.

Cruel death: Hana's emaciated body covered in bruises was found face down in the mud in the backyard of the family's home in Sedro-Woolley, Washington

Cause of death: An autopsy showed that the 13-year-old died from hypothermia exacerbated by malnutrition and gastritis

'I would suffer with the pain until it eventually went away,' he said in sign language July 29.

Larry’s attorney, Rachel Forde, characterized the Ethiopian boy as a troublemaker who lied to his adoptive parents and refused to do lessons assigned by his mother.

While the couple's biological children, five of whom had testified during the trial, were generally treated better, the strict rules in the Williams household applied to them as well.

According to Joseph Williams, however, he and his siblings were given the authority to punish and even spank their adopted brother and sister, KIRO-TV reported.

Joseph was called to the stand to describe the night of May 12, 2011, when his 13-year-old adopted sister died.

Joseph Williams told the court that after Hana died while sitting in the yard in 40-degree weather, his mother instructed him to bring the girl's body inside, where she performed CPR and called 911.

The mother of nine said on the call that her daughter Hana 'has killed herself.'

When asked by the 911 dispatcher why she believed her daughter had taken her own life, Williams said that the girl was not breathing and lying face down in the mud after refusing to come indoors, according to the Seattle Times.

Calling Hana 'rebellious,' the mother said that she had seen the 13-year-old throwing herself to the ground and staggering about the yard after taking her clothes off.

A local weather station reported that the temperature that night was 42 degrees.

First responders arrived just after midnight and rushed Hana to Skagit Valley Hospital, where she was pronounced dead an hour later.

An autopsy report concluded that the girl died from hypothermia, with malnutrition and chronic gastritis as contributing factors. According to the girl’s medical records, between 2009 and 2011, she had lost nearly 30lbs and was short for her age.

Larry and Carri Williams were arrested September 29, 2011, on charges of homicide by abuse in connection with their daughter's death, and first-degree assault of a child stemming from mistreatment of Immanuel.

If convicted, each faces a prison term of between 20 and 29 years, according to state sentencing guidelines.
