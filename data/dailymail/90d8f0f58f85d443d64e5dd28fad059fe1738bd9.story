Manchester United and Liverpool are set to do battle over Norwegian teen sensation Martin Odegaard.

The fierce rivals were among those paying close attention to the 15-year-old's international debut this week.

Odegaard became his country’s youngest-ever player when he appeared against the UAE.

Easy to forget he's only 15: But perhaps not when Martin Odegaard's age is also his shirt number

But the secret is out on the Stromsgodset midfielder and the English sides were joined by Barcelona, Real Madrid and Juventus in the stands at Stavanger.

The European heavyweights will again be in attendance when Odegaard and Norway face England at Wembley next week.

Hernandez to seal £10m club record move to Hull 

Abel Hernandez will complete his move to Hull City on Friday but a work-permit hearing means he is unlikely to be available for the weekend.

A fee approaching £10million – a club record - has been agreed for the Palermo striker but he still needs the necessary paperwork before the deal is done.

Against the clock: Steve Bruce must find cover for injured Robert Snodgrass before the window shuts

Hernandez – who has completed a medical and agreed personal terms - has been capped 14 times by Uruguay and was part of their squad at the World Cup in Brazil, so manager Steve Bruce does not envisage any problems in that respect.

The delay, however, means he will miss Sunday’s trip to Aston Villa.

Meanwhile, Bruce is still looking to replace the injured Robert Snodgrass and West Ham’s Mo Diame is on a shortlist along with Manchester United's Tom Cleverley.

One in, one out at the back for Sunderland 

Sunderland defender Valentin Roberge is set for a return to France – and that should pave the way for the arrival of Celtic’s Virgil van Dijk.

Ligue 1 club Reims want Roberge and they are in talks with the Black Cats over a fee, thought to be nominal given his free-transfer signing from Maritimo last summer.

Transfer tussle: Celtic defender Virgil van Dijk attracting attention at Sunderland and Southampton

Sunderland boss Gus Poyet will immediately look to replace Roberge with Dutch centre half Van Dijk. Celtic are willing to sell the 23-year-old and he was offered to Newcastle last week.

They are holding out for a fee of £8m but, given their failure to qualify for the Champions League, they are likely to accept £6m. 

Southampton are also interested.

McArthur set for a date at the Palace 

James McArthur is set to choose Crystal Palace over Leicester City.

The Foxes have made a £7m approach for the Wigan midfielder but Palace have also entered the race and Selhurst Park is his likely destination.

Metalist Kharkiv winger Sebastian Blanco will sign for West Brom in a £2m deal.

Albion are in discussion with the Argentine and he is set to become their 11th signing of the summer.
