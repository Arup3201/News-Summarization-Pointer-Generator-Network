A fancy dress float featuring a man dressed as serial sex predator Jimmy Savile has sparked outrage in a small Scottish Borders town.

Thousands of families and visitors turned out to watch the parade through Lauder in Berwickshire – one of the highlights of its annual Common Riding festivities.

But bystanders’ cheers turned to gasps of horror when they saw the man’s costume theme was based on the disgraced BBC television presenter. Other men on the float were dressed as schoolgirls.

Outrage: The Twenty 10 Club float which paraded through Lauder in Berwickshire

Many of the shocked spectators vowed not to attend future events staged as part of the week-long Common Riding programme, which is held to celebrate the Royal Burgh’s history.

They insist the actions of the local group – calling themselves the Twenty 10 Club – went beyond what was acceptable.

Some of those who were offended by the float have vented their anger on Lauder Common Riding’s Facebook page.

One spectator, George Kynoch, said: ‘I feel that was a step way over the line. What I had hoped would be a pleasant night and a good memory has now been tainted.’

Another resident, Margaret Ryles, said: ‘I feel there was no respect for those who were abused by this very sick, sick man.

‘This float should never have been allowed to have been entered, regardless of freedom of speech and expression.’

Jimmy Savile is suspected of abusing more than 200 people before his death in 2011

Christine Grahame, the Nationalist MSP for Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale, said: ‘Floats are supposed to be for fun and families. I have to say that I think this was really pretty bad taste.

‘You can have humour in some circumstances but given what we know about him now and what perhaps we have yet to find out, in these circumstances I don’t think it was appropriate.’

However the controversial entry – which was awarded third place by judges at the weekend – has also been fiercely defended on the same social networking page.

And organisers of the showpiece event insist there are no plans to vet future floats.

Elaine Brotherstone, secretary of Lauder Common Riding, said it would remain up to fancy dress competitors what outfits they elected  to wear. She said: ’We have never censored anyone at the fancy dress and do not intend to. There was no offence intended and they were not trivialising what happened.

‘It is about freedom of speech.  People have the right to complain but don’t have the right to tell us what to do.’

A Metropolitan Police report into allegations of sexual assault by Savile described him as a ‘prolific, predatory sex offender’ who is suspected of abusing more than 200 people before his death in 2011.
