Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi has found herself in hot water after it was revealed that she pushed back the execution of a convicted killer to accommodate her re-election fundraiser, which fell on the same day.

Marshall Lee Gore was originally scheduled to die by lethal injection today, but Governor Rick Scott last month agreed to delay the date to October 1 at the request of the state attorney general.

On Monday, Pam Bondi went into damage control mode, conceding in a statement that it was wrong to allow her campaign event to take precedent over an execution.

Gore's execution had been scheduled twice before this year but he received a stay amid ongoing questions over his sanity.

When the latest date change was announced it was not publicly known it was done to accommodate a Bondi campaign event scheduled for the same night.

Gore was convicted of the March 11, 1988, killing of Robyn Novick, a 30-year-old exotic dancer whose naked body was found in a rural part of Miami-Dade County, partly covered by a blue tarpaulin.

Gore was also sentenced to die for the slaying in January 1988 of Susan Roark, whose body was found a few months later in Columbia County in northern Florida.

In addition to the two death sentences, Gore was given seven life sentences plus another 110 years in a case involving the attempted murder of a third woman.

The woman, an exotic dancer, testified during the trial for the Novick killing that she was beaten with a rock; choked, raped and stabbed; and left near the spot where Novick's body was found.

The woman was attacked two days after Novick disappeared. Novick had been stabbed and strangled.

Loved ones of Gore’s victims were upset to learn of the reason for the delay in his execution.

'What's going on down there? It's ridiculous,' Robyn Novick's mother, Phyllis, told the Tampa Bay Times.

Speaking to the station WTSP Tuesday, the 86-year-old Ohio woman who had waited 25 years to see her daughter's killer executed called this latest delay a 'shame.'

Kept in the dark: Florida Gov. Rick Scott granted Bondi's request to push back the execution, but said he did not know that the reason was because it conflicted with her fundraiser

'I just think what's been going on has been just terrible for us,' Phyllis Novick said. 'It was just awful for everybody.'

The
Republican governor said he changed the date at Bondi's request, but he
acknowledged on Monday that he did not know that the reason was because
it conflicted with the fundraiser scheduled in Tampa.

Scott,
who would not say if he would have delayed the execution if he knew 
about the event, said it's routine for the governor's office to work in 
tandem with the statewide elected officials who make up the Florida 
Cabinet.

'When another cabinet member asks for something, we try to work with them,’ Scott said.  

Hours after Scott answered questions about the execution delay Bondi issued a statement that said she should have not have made the request.

‘As a prosecutor, there was nothing more important than seeing justice done, especially when it came to the unconscionable act of murder,’ Bondi said. ‘I personally put two people on death row and, as Attorney General, have already participated in eight executions since I took office, a role I take very seriously.

‘The planned execution of Marshall Lee Gore had already been stayed twice by the courts, and we should not have requested that the date of the execution be moved,’ she said.

Phyllis Novick, however, said she had no use in Bondi's apology at this point, adding that she has nothing to say to the attorney general.

Bondi worked for the Hillsborough County state attorney before she ran for attorney general in 2010. This summer she opened her campaign account for a second term. So far she has no declared opposition.

The attorney general plays a pivotal 
role in executions. It represents the state in death row appeals cases. 
Usually the attorney general remains available on the date of the 
executions in case of any last-minute legal issues.

Bondi's office said that is why she sought a delay in Gore's execution.

‘In light of the seriousness of any execution, it was very important to Attorney General Bondi that she be available personally to carry out her office's duties in the execution process,’ said Jenn Meale, a spokeswoman for Bondi.

Bondi's decision to seek a delay in the execution date because it conflicted with a fundraiser was first reported by The News Service of Florida.

Gore's attorneys have argued before that he is mentally ill. One previous lawyer claimed Gore was ‘mentally deranged’ and not responsible for his actions. But several judges concluded he was using a claim of mental illness to manipulate the judicial process.

Gore's execution was first scheduled in June but he received a stay two hours before he was supposed to receive a lethal injection.

He then received a second stay of execution a day before his July execution date. The Florida Supreme Court in August ruled that Gore was sane enough to be executed.

The
delay keeps Gore on death row an extra 21 days to the tune of about 
$1,000, according to the Department of Corrections’ estimates.

Gore's
attorneys have argued that he is mentally ill. During his trials, he 
had frequent verbal outbursts, laughed out loud and even howled.

He
has also contended that the previous date of his execution, June 24, 
2013, adds up to 666 and that he is a target of 'Satan Worshippers who 
have threatened that date by mail for years'.

But Gore has no significant history of mental illness and last month a panel of psychiatrists found that he was mentally sound.

They said that Gore claimed that the 'Illuminati' wanted him dead to sell his organs - a story they say he made up to manipulate the judicial process.

Gore first kidnapped a stripper named Tina in March 1988, raped her, slit her throat and hit her across the head with a rock before leaving her to die in a rural area.

But she survived and managed to alert police. Gore had also stolen her car - and her two-year-old son in the back seat. He was later found alive locked in a cabinet of an abandoned home in Georgia.

While officers were searching for the boy, they found Novick's body. The 30-year-old had met Gore while working as a dancer in North Miami-Dade.

Crimes: He killed two women in 1988 and raped another before kidnapping her two-year-old son

Gore was tracked down to Kentucky. When he was found, he had Tina's woman's bank and credit cards in his jacket pocket, according to court documents.

Police also identified him as the person
who killed Roark. She had last been seen with Gore before vanishing in 
April 1988. Her body was found off a rural forest road.

Upon questioning about all three crimes and shown pictures of Novick's body, police said his eyes filled with tears and he said: 'If I did this, I deserve the death penalty.'

Gore initially denied knowing any of the women, according to police. But he later testified that all three women worked for him at his escort service.

In 1995, he was found guilty of Novick's murder and sent to Death Row. Gov. Scott signed the death warrant.
