Concern is growing for the safety of a courageous Chinese activist who was detained after helping a blind dissident escape house arrest.

Human rights campaigners believe He Peirong was arrested for her involvement in the plot which freed legal activist Chen Guangcheng, 40, who had been in captivity for almost six years.

At least four members of Chen's family and another of his supporters are also thought to have been rounded up.

Concerns: Fears are growing for He Peirong, left, who has been detained for her involvement in the plot to free Chen Guangcheng, from house arrest

He Peirong, from Nanjing, had been at the forefront of the campaign to free Chen, a self-taught 'barefoot lawyer' who was jailed for four years and then held for 19 months under heavy guard after exposing forced abortions as part of China's one-child policy.

She claimed she had driven Chen to a 'relatively safe place' after he dodged more than 100 guards and broke loose from Dongshigu village, in China's Shangdong province, southeast of Beijing.

Chen was then driven 350 miles through the countryside to the U.S. Embassy.

Bob Fu, of Texas-based human rights group China Aid, is reported to have spoken to He Peirong on Friday, but she hung up when she told him 'public security' was at the door.

Friends have been unable to contact her since then and her phone was switched off on Friday evening.

Police in Nanjing said they knew nothing of the case.

One user on Sina's microblog service compared He Peirong to Spider-Man 'bravely going to dangerous places'.

The message continued: 'She has been beaten and insulted in [Dongshigu].

'She keeps her faith and courage.'

Activists
 now fear for the safety of Chen's wife, Yuan Weijing, his six-year-old 
daughter, his elderly mother and other family members who they believe 
have been rounded up in retribution.

HIs nephew, Chen Kegu, was said to be in hiding after using a kitchen knife to defend his mother from intruders.

Another activist, Gao Yushan, is also believed to have been detained.

Li
 Fangping, a rights lawyer who tried to represent Chen in his court 
case, told Associated Press that state security had questioned him on 
Friday.

Sophie Richardson, of Human Rights Watch, said: 'It has been extraordinary – this is high stakes stuff.

High-level talks: The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, Kurt Campbell arrived at a hotel in Beijing to discuss the case

'None of these people will have gone into it without a pretty clear idea of what might happen to them as a result.

'That shows extraordinary courage on the part of activists who are extremely vulnerable to exactly these kinds of reprisals … In my view, the least other governments can do is stand with them.'

The U.S. has declined to comment on Chen's whereabouts, but a photograph has emerged of him meeting fellow Chinese dissident Hu Jia at an undisclosed location in Beijing.

China Aid has issued a statement claiming it 
'learned from a source close to the Chen Guangcheng situation that Chen 
is under U.S. protection'.

The group said 'high-level talks' were under way 
between U.S. and Chinese officials regarding Chen's 'status'.

The claims could overshadow a two-day meeting with top Obama administration officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in Beijing from Thursday, and ignite new tensions between the two governments.

The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, Kurt Campbell was today seen arriving at a hotel in Beijing, to discuss the case.

Mr Fu said: 'Because
 of Chen's wide popularity, the Obama Administration must stand firmly 
with him or risk losing credibility as a defender of freedom and the 
rule of law.'

The reports of Chen's escape come nearly three months after a Chinese official Wang Lijun fled into a U.S. consulate for over 24 hours on February 6, unleashing a scandal that has rattled the ruling Communist Party months before a once-in-a-decade leadership handover.

Anger: The activist's detention for exposing forced abortions in China caused international outcry

Wang's brief flight to the U.S. 
consulate led to the downfall of top official Bo Xilai who had been 
openly campaigning for a place in the inner circle of power in Beijing.

Pu Zhiqiang, a Beijing lawyer and 
rights advocate, said reliable contacts also told him Chen took refuge 
in U.S. embassy grounds.

He said: 'Everyone knew about the 
suffering of Chen Guangcheng and his family but nobody dared raised his 
head over this and ignored it.

'Chen Guangcheng has been the most 
typical victim of this lawless, boundless exercise of power. But the day
 has finally come when he has escaped from it.'

Chen angered authorities in 2005 by 
exposing forced abortion in his own village and others nearby as part of
 China's one-child policy.

Surrounded: Visitors trying to see Chen Guangcheng, including Christian Bale, have been forcibly removed from the village by over-zealous Chinese guards

He
 was jailed soon after on a charge of 'blocking traffic' and damaging 
property in a protest, and has been held under house arrested ever since
 his release in September 2010.

Lawyers and activists attempted to 
visit Chen in him home ever since have been forcibly denied entry to his
 village by guards, while the man himself compared his own home to a 
'prison' due to his plight.

It
 is thought the Chinese authorities had no legal grounds for detaining 
him, and guards even scuffled with Hollywood star Christian Bale when 
the Batman actor tried to visit Chen in his home.
