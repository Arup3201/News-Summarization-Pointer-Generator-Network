Rosemann has been in the dancing industry for almost 15 years and said he joined the Flying Steps crew in 1994 - one year after it was formed.

'I just love it and I'm proud that I have turned this into a life long career.

'I started break dancing in 1991 after I saw music clips all over the music channels so I went to a breakdance workshop and shortly after, I self taught myself everything. 

The performance composes piano, harpsichord and electronic beats with head spins, power moves, freezes and ballet steps.

Choreographer and mastermind behind the Red Bull Flying Bach, Vartan Bassil said: 'our first visit to Australia in 2013 was a huge success and we're really excited that this time, we can take the production to followers of the urban and classical worlds across multiple states and cities. 

'Red Bull Flying Bach really offers something unique – it introduces classical music to the street scene, but also allows high art fans to experience the best in urban dance,' he said.

Artistic Director Christopher Hagel said: 'The sharpness, freshness and coolness of Bach's prelude and fugues work faultlessly with the dance style of the Flying Steps. 

'When this type of break dance comes together with the sound of piano and harpsichord, the incredible masterpieces of Bach are brought to life and made relevant for modern audience.'
