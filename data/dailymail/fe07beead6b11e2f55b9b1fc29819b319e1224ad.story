Suspended eviction order: Gateshead mother Julie Burnham, 43, said that she no longer has the horses

A 43-year-old mother has been threatened with eviction after turning her outside shed into a stable for her pet horses.

Julie Burnham, of Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, cut off the top half of her outhouse door and scattered hay inside to create a stable for the animals.

Her family were said to regularly ride their ponies up and down the street where they live and horse manure was allegedly even posted through a neighbour's letterbox.

Housing officers visiting her home spotted a pony in the back yard and the outhouse being used as a stable. Burnham was threatened with eviction if she failed to clean up the house.

The family are said to have committed a catalogue of anti-social behaviour offences.

Neighbours have complained that the two ponies being kept at the property were being ridden on the footpaths around the estate.

It is also claimed that a group of teenagers at the house were shouting, swearing and breaking branches off the trees, while on another occasion visitors to the house were fighting and neighbours had to complain about loud music.

Burnham said that she no longer has the horses and that they have now been sold.

Gateshead County Court heard of more than 60 incidents of anti-social behaviour and placed a year-long suspended eviction order on Burnham.

If she, her son or any visitors to the home are involved in any anti-social activities between now and January 2014, she will be evicted.

Neil Bouch, the Gateshead Housing Company's director of customers and communities, said: ‘We want to help people feel safe in their homes and neighbourhoods.

‘So we will not tolerate the unreasonable behaviour of a small minority of residents, which causes a disturbance to other residents.

‘The housing company will continue to work with Gateshead Council, the police and the courts to reduce the threat of antisocial behaviour across the borough.’
