A 31-year-old biology teacher planned to murder his wife in order to be with the 17-year-old student he was having an affair with, according to court documents.

Ethan Richard Estevez, a former teacher at the Center for Educational Opportunity School in Aberdeen, Maryland, was charged last week with the attempted first degree murder of his unnamed wife.

The charges come just two months after Estevez was fired from the Hartford County alternative school for having sex with a 17-year-old female student.

According to text message conversations detectives obtained from the unidentified student, the two were planing to kill Estevez's wife as far back as a February, the Baltimore Sun reports.

In a message to an unidentified person, the student writes: 'Like it has to look like an accident because of life insurance and stuff and she works at mid atlantic medical monday and thursday from 7:30 to 4:30'.

The girl later wrote that she would 'just needed it to really happen before [Sunday]' in another message.

Last month, a person who corresponded with the student came forward to detail Estevez's murder plot.

According to the source, Estevez wanted someone to drive by in a dark vehicle and shoot his wife dead and also hit him in the shoulder so the attack would look more random.

When the student was later interviewed by detectives, she said she 'really was not gonna kill' Estevez's wife and just thought the idea was a joke.

Estevez was suspended from teaching in March after it was revealed he was having an affair with the student in question.

The teacher came under investigation when the student started telling her friends about the relationship and another teacher became suspicious.

In March, the girl's mother called Estevez and the conversation was recorded by local authorities.

In the call, Estevez said he loved her daughter and wanted to marry her. He said the two did not have sex but admitted to kissing her.

A month later, the two were still exchanging text messages when the student's phone was seized, and in one message Estevez allegedly admitted to having sex with the minor.

He has since been indicted on charges of sex abuse of a minor and fourth-degree sex offense.

The student victim is only listed by her initials in documents for both cases.

The judge who proceeded over Estevez's bail hearing last Friday said he 'cannot ignore the seriousness of the charge'.

'It's about as serious as it gets, but he is entitled to some bail, I believe,' Hartford County District Court Judge David Carey said.

Estevez's parents were in the courtroom for the hearing and he was released on $75,000 bond.

'He intends to vigorously defend against the allegations,' Estevez's lawyer Karen Jones said. 

Estevez formerly worked in the Hartford County's alternative education school which helps students 'who may have experienced crisis' in grades seven to 12.

According to a school spokesman, he was hired in August 2012, placed on administrative leave in March 2014, and fired last June.
