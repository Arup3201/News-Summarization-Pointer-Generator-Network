Only half of parents think their neighbourhood is safe enough for their children to walk through.

And fewer than a third believe their children are safe to ride their bikes, a poll reveals today.

Such fears about playing out are at odds with the freedom to roam enjoyed by many of the parents when they were youngsters.

Only half of parents think their neighbourhood is safe enough for their children to walk through. And fewer than a third believe their children are safe to ride their bikes, a poll reveals today

The study by AA Streetwatch reveals that more than nine out of ten (94 per cent) think that children should walk more.

However, fewer than six out of ten (56 per cent) believe their neighbourhood is safe enough to do so.

Moves to encourage children to cycle more are supported by nearly eight out of ten people, but fewer than a third feel their local streets offer a secure enough environment

Similarly, moves to encourage children to cycle more are supported by nearly eight out of ten people (76 per cent).

But fewer than a third (31 per cent) feel their local streets offer a secure enough environment.

The responses came from a survey of more than 22,000 AA Streetwatch volunteers who gave their views on roads in their local neighbourhood.

The results also reveal a postcode lottery of safety fears.

Luton came out as the least safe place for children to walk locally. 

By contrast, St Albans, just 12 miles down the road, was in the top five safest areas.

Nationally, only one in 14 (7 per cent) agreed with the statement that it is better to take children  everywhere by car no matter how short the journey.

Among the areas where people considered it least safe for children walking were Luton,  Liverpool, Birmingham, Wolverhampton and Slough. 

Considered the safest were St Albans, Harrogate, Portsmouth, Bromley, Brighton and Bolton.

The lowest proportion of respondents agreeing that children should be encouraged to cycle more was in London (71 per cent).
