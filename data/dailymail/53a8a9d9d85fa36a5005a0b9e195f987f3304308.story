Virgil van Dijk has hit back at Sean Dillon after the Dundee United skipper said he set out to injure him during the League Cup Final.

Dillon required six minutes of treatment, and a number of stitches, after coming off second best in a 50-50 with the Dutchman. To compound his frustration, in his absence, Kris Commons scored the goal which put Ronny Deila’s side on their way to a 2-0 triumph.

Dillon was later sent off for a lunge on Emilio Izaguirre but felt justice was not correctly served in his earlier confrontation with van Dijk.

‘I think he left his leg in, I didn’t like it,’ Dillon stated. ‘I get the ball, he gets my leg, and they get a throw-in. So that’s very frustrating.

‘I’m not going to exaggerate it but it’s a big gash, about three inches long maybe, and I needed seven stitches in it.’

But van Dijk hit back at Dillon’s version of events by insisting there was nothing in the challenge.

‘No, never,’ van Dijk countered. ‘I know we are not going to have the same conversations as we had last week but I can honestly say I didn’t do anything wrong.

‘I didn’t leave my foot in, I would never do that on a fellow player.’

Van Dijk had been sent packing by Craig Thompson at Tannadice and only learned on Thursday that he was free to take his place at Hampden. He admitted the uncertainty surrounding the disciplinary case made the build-up to the game far from ideal.

‘It was a very good feeling to win the cup, especially after the tough week I had personally,’ said the Dutchman. ‘I was worried after the game last week. I was very stressed and really down.

‘I couldn’t believe I was sent off. I was disappointed with the red card and knew it was going to be a long week even though we said we were going to appeal straight away.

‘You want to know as soon as possible.

‘It was a strange week so I was just happy to be able to play. It would have been very hard to watch it from the stands.

‘This was my first final ever and it was special. We are on our way for the Treble and we want to make history. I wanted to play in the final very badly.’

‘It gives the manager a boost - but it gives everyone at Celtic a boost. We knew if we were up for it we had a chance to win it. Hopefully we can go on and win the league and Scottish Cup. That’s what we aim to do.

‘We know if we are at 100 per cent we can beat everyone in the country. I am very confident we will get the job done.’

Nir Bitton meantime spent the past week nursing fears over the prospect of personal League Cup Final heartbreak. After limping off during the stormy 1-1 Scottish Cup quarter final draw with Dundee United the previous Sunday, the Israeli admits he was slowly coming to terms with the fact he was going to miss the biggest game of his life.

That would have been a cruel blow for Bitton, who admits to becoming hooked on Hampden during the 2-0 semi final win over Rangers last month.

In the end, however, the prospect of a first cup win of his fledgling career proved the perfect pain relief for his aching ankle.

‘I’ll be honest with you, at the beginning of last week, I didn’t expect to be fit for the Final,’ Bitton said. ‘I trained for the first time on Saturday morning and I was a little bit afraid going into the game. If it was a league game, I may have given the injury a little bit more time to heal.

‘But I pushed it simply because it was a cup final. Nobody wants to miss a cup final in their life, especially after the atmosphere that I felt at Hampden in the semi final win over Rangers.

‘I’m just happy that I managed to get back and we managed to win. When it comes to a Cup Final, you know everything is about winning and you think of nothing else when you win. So I’m happy to have won and I’m happy to have the trophy.’
