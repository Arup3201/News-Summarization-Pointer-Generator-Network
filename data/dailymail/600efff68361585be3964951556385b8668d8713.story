Warning: Michael Gove has been warned that 'dumbed-down' exams featuring celebrities could fatally undermine his attempt to drive up standards

Education Secretary Michael Gove has been warned that ‘dumbed-down’ exams featuring pop stars and comedians could fatally undermine his attempt to drive up standards.

Experts said there has been a growing trend to introduce popular culture into exams for 30 years, and last week’s disclosure that one of the country’s biggest exam boards is introducing questions on Russell Brand and Dizzee Rascal in its new English A-level was another example.

Professor Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at Buckingham University, said that exam chiefs had been competing to make themselves popular with students since the mid-1980s.

But they are ‘short-changing’ pupils because popular culture was ‘shallow and transitory’.

A Mail on Sunday survey shows that questions based on popular culture have appeared in exam papers for a number of years, and experts have criticised the Government for failing to take action.

Government adviser Chris McGovern said Mr Gove promised to introduce A-levels with more rigour and depth, but ‘a clear direction of travel’ had been revealed in the new English A-level syllabus by the Oxford, Cambridge and RSA (OCR) board.

He said: ‘Everything that this Government has fought for in terms of raising educational standards will stand or fall  on the quality of public examinations.

‘The new syllabus for A-level English is one small indicator that, for all the talk  of reform in education, not a great deal is likely to change in the classroom.’

Sheila Lawlor, director of think tank 
Politeia, said using ‘celebrity speak’ because boards felt it encouraged
 children to engage was a ‘regrettable trend’.

Exams: Experts said there has been a growing trend to introduce popular culture into exams for 30 years

Under the 
OCR proposals, teenagers will study the delivery style, purpose and 
features of ‘celebrity language’ alongside Shakespeare and William 
Blake.

The
 English exam, to be introduced next year, will feature extracts from 
Brand’s appearance before the Home Affairs Select Committee when he gave
 evidence on drug addiction.

Other texts will include Twitter feeds, speeches by the artist Grayson Perry and newspaper columns. 

It is not uncommon for exam boards to court popularity by asking questions about modish popular culture.
