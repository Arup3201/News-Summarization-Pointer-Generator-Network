When it comes to artistic inspiration, it appears that former US President-turned-painter George W. Bush has looked no further than the top Google image searches.

The art and culture blog Animal New York claimed Tuesday that the two dozen oil paintings of world leaders featured in Mr Bush's much-hyped solo exhibition that opened in Dallas last week are nothing more than reproductions of some of the first results that pop up on Google.

For his renditions of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russia’s stone-faced President Valdimir Putin, Bush was inspired by photos that appear in his subjects' Wikipedia entries.

Carbon copy: George W. Bush apparently sourced all his oil paintings of world leaders from Google image searches, including this painting of Vladimir Putin, which is based on an image that appears in his Wikipedia entry (right)

'Tense relationship': He showed his image of Putin as he said that they had been friendly throughout his time in the White House, but that Putin had always felt as if the U.S. were the enemy

‘Bush based his paintings on the 
literally first-to-surface, easiest-to-find photos of his subjects,’ 
Critic and artist Greg Allen stated.

Copyright conundrum: A canvas depicting former French President Jacques Chirac was lifted from a photograph copyrighted by the Associated Press

Afghan President Hamid Karzai's painting was inspired by a photo that appears in the top 10 Google images, while former Israeli President Ehud Olmert's portrait was based on a 2009 image that in the second most popular search result.

Animal
 also reported that a canvas depicting former French President Jacques 
Chirac was lifted from a photograph copyrighted by the Associated Press.

But
 according to Allen, the former leader of the free world is not likely 
to face a lawsuit because he has clearly transformed the imags, for 
better or worse.

‘Copyright infringement is the one thing he’s NOT guilty of,’ Allen said.

The new collection by the former president, who picked up the paintbrush after leaving the White House, includes Tony Blair, Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai, Germany's Chancellor  Merkel and the Dalai Lama.

Most
 striking is a stern-looking Russian President Putin, but Bush said his 
favorite was the painting of his father, George H. W. Bush.

Bush said he was inspired to pick up the paintbrush by Winston Churchill, who discovered his love for painting when he was 40.

'I wanted to make sure that the last chapters of my life were full,' he told his daughter in a Today Show interview last week. 'Painting would occupy not only space but open my mind.'

But he added: 'I was a little reluctant to put them out because I'm not a great artist and I don't want people to think I'm a great artist. But... I'm a driven person and I want to get better. A whole new world has opened up.'

His wife, Laura, who joined him for part of the interview, said she had encouraged him to paint after he mastered a writing and drawing iPhone application, Penultimate.

Blair

Similar? Bush said that the images, including this one of Tony Blair, were painted 'in the spirit of friendship'

'He started drawing very interesting stick figures to communicate with us,' she said.

So Bush got a few pointers from a teacher, telling her: 'There's a Rembrandt trapped in this body. It's your job to unleash him', he told the Today show.

He started drawing images of the family's pets, including their late dog Barney. And last year, a hacker leaked some of his 
images, including him in the 
bath and him looking in a mirror.

'I was annoyed,' Bush said. 'It's an invasion of one's privacy... nor do I want my paintings to get out.

'The truth 
of the matter is my paintings are not ready to be released. I mean, I'm 
still learning, and I don't know if they ever will be or not.'

Friendships: He said none of the leaders, including the Dalai Lama, above, had seen the images

On show: Margaret Spellings (R), president of the George W. Bush Presidential Center speaks alongside Amy Polley, library and museum curator as the exhibition opens on Friday

Speaking to his daughter, who is a special 
correspondent on the Today show, he added that the most important thing he 
has learned so far is, 'don't paint your wife,' he said.

Of his portrait of her, wife Laura laughed: 'Yeah, it still needs some work.'

And his mother, Barbara Bush, also had some critique for her son's art.

'That's my husband?' she joked when she saw the image of George H.W. Bush for the first time on the Today show, before adding: 'I really like it.'

When asked if she thought her son captured the essence of her husband, she paused before saying: 'I think maybe he did. I like it very much... He's good.'

Bush, who began painting when he left the White House, also painted Liberia's Ellen Johnson Sirleaf

Remembered: He painted Václav Havel, the first president of the Czech Republic, who passed away in 2011

Proud of his work: He shows his daughter his painting of former Japanese president Junichiro Koizumi

But she quipped that she will not allow her son to paint her because 'it might look like me'.

As
 his paintings of the world leaders were revealed, Bush said he 
hopes the leaders will like them. None of them have yet seen 
the images, he said.

'I hope
 they take it in the spirit in which these were painted in,' he said. 'That was the
 spirit of friendship and that I admire them as leaders and was willing 
to give it a shot in terms of getting people to see how I felt about 
them.'

Speaking about the artwork brought back images of his time with the world leaders, especially Putin. He said they had a good relationship, but that he always thought Putin saw the U.S. as an enemy.

Budding artist: Bush said he was inspired by Winston Churchill to pick up the paintbrush later in life

He added that the Russian leader once 
took it too far when he criticized his beloved Scottish terrier, Barney,
 saying, 'You call that a dog?'

He
 explained that he later visited Putin and met his dog, whom the Russian
 leader noted was ‘bigger, stronger and faster than Barney'.

'I didn't react,' he said. 'I just 
said, "Wow. Anybody who thinks ‘my dog is bigger than your dog’ is an 
interesting character." And that painting kind of reflects that.'

The 
two-term president has led a significantly quieter life since leaving 
office - spending much of his time painting and going on mountain bike 
rides with groups of veterans like Wounded Warrior.

In
 an interview with the Dallas Morning News last year, Bush added that 
painting gives him an opportunity to 'create.' He also reflected on what
 others think of his work.

'Joyous experience': Bush said the painting of his father, George H. W. Bush was his favorite

'People are surprised,' Bush said. 'Of course, some people are surprised I can even read.'

In
 March last year, an artist who taught Bush how to paint both animals 
and landscapes in a recent month-long course spoke out his skills as a 
late-in-life painter.

He had spent four weeks in private 
lessons alongside his sister-in-law in a home in Boca Grande, Florida 
where they improved their technique and expanded their artistic 
horizons.

'He has such a passion for painting, it's amazing,' said instructor Bonnie Flood.

'The
 Art of Leadership: A President's Personal Diplomacy' will be held at 
the George W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum on the campus of 
Southern Methodist University in Dallas. 

Work: Some of his paintings, including images of dogs and self-portraits, have previously been seen

Honing his skills: After painting the family pets, he said he then began painting landscapes

Revealed: Some of the images, including ones of him in the shower and a bathtub, were leaked last year

Invasive: Bush said that he felt that much of his artwork wasn't ready for public viewing

The
 museum explained the exhibition 'will explore the relationships that 
President George W. Bush forged with world leaders to shape 
international policy and advance American interests abroad.'

'The
 exhibit will feature more than two dozen never-before-exhibited 
portraits painted by President Bush,' it said.

'Portraits will be 
accompanied by artifacts, photographs, and personal reflections to help 
illustrate the stories of relationships formed on the world stage.'
