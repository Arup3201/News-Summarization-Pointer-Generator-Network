Colombia defender Mario Yepes insists that Real Madrid star James Rodriguez could challenge Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for this year's Ballon d'Or.

Rodriguez has been named on the 23-man shortlist after a brilliant World Cup campaign with Colombia and a big money move from Monaco to Madrid in the summer.

Although the 23-year-old is yet to reach the goalscoring heights of Ronaldo or Messi, Yepes is confident his compatriot is showing why Madrid paid upwards of £60million for his talents.

The Colombia captain told Fifa's official website: 'Can James compete with Cristiano Ronaldo and [Lionel] Messi for the Ballon d’Or? I’m sure that given what he achieved at the World Cup, he’s got what it takes to challenge them

'He’s also showing that he was signed by Real Madrid on merit and has tons of potential. Let’s hope he can push Ronaldo and Messi all the way, and why not? 

'He’s a lad with incredible vision, great mobility and so much composure it’s like he’s playing at a different tempo, but it’s just the way he plays.

'Those guys are monsters, two phenomenons, but they’ve got different characteristics and play in a different position [to Rodriguez]. They’re more about scoring goals, about turning a game. They run with the ball, they’re decisive and they score lots of a goals per season.

'But, like I said, James has this style of play, this tempo, which sets him apart from them.'
