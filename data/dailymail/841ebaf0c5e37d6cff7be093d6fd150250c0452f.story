Manchester United have stunned their supporters by signing Bolton Wanderers defender Andy Kellett on loan for the remainder of the season.

The 21-year-old has made just one appearance for Neil Lennon's side this season, playing 51 minutes in the Trotters' 4-2 defeat by Rotherham.

Kellett, who was on loan at Plymouth for three months earlier in the season, will join United's Under 21 side until June.

Manchester United have stunned their supporters by signing Bolton Wanderers defender Andy Kellett on loan

He made his Bolton debut at the tail end of last season - playing in the final three games of the campaign - with a late substitute appearance in a 1-0 home defeat by Leicester. Further cameos followed in a 3-1 win at Sheffield Wednesday and a home draw with Birmingham.

It means Kellet has played 85 minutes of Championship football although he was a regular for Plymouth between October last year and January. He scored one goal - in a 3-2 win at Northampton - in 15 games, 

As part of the deal, 19-year-old midfielder Saidy Janko will move the other way

Kellett is thought to have been brought in due to a lack of numbers in the Manchester giants' youth team after numerous players were sent out on loan.

As part of the deal, 19-year-old midfielder Saidy Janko will move the other way.

With rumours of Mats Hummels joining from Dortmund, it's safe to say the defensive signing is not quite what United's fans were hoping for on transfer deadline day.

Who?

Exactly. When Jim White reported the signing on Sky Sports News' Deadline Day coverage, Twitter went into meltdown. Surely this was some mistake? This was not a Mats Hummels or a Marco Reus. Across the country, bemused United fans rewound their TVs and wnt straight to Google. Sure enough, abut half an hour after the deadline came confirmation via a tweet from United's official account to their 4.35m followers. The club had brought in Andy Kellett on loan for the rest of the season with Under 21 right back Saidy Janko going the other way.

But why?

It's a good question. Some would wonder about the logic behind sending one of your own players out on loan and bringing another in on loan. But there is method in the madness. United are keen to get as many of their own youngsters out into the big bad world of men's football. They want them toughened up and introduced to a level of aggression rarely seen in the Under 21 league. Officials will hope Janko's footballing education will be furthered in the Championship. Departures like this, however, leave their own Under 21 side short of numbers. Manager Warren Joyce is known to believe that there are many unearthed gems in the lower leagues. He is known as a coach who sees things in players that others do not. This would appear to be the case with Kellett.

So what's his pedigree?

He's Bolton-born , 21 and a left back. A product of the club's academy he has made four first-team appearances and earned a loan move to Plymouth Argyle in October. While at the League Two Devon side he scored a wonder goal at Northampton Town and was described as a solid performer by fans.

How did the move come about?

United had to fight off interest from Plymouth (not a sentence you often write) to bring him to Old Trafford. The Bolton News spoke to first-team coach Garry Parker who relayed the amusing moment when the news was broken to the youngster.

'Sit down,' he said, before adding that they had some 'good news and bad news'. Kellett opted for the bad news and was told he was not going to Home Park.

Presumably fearing the worst he tentatively enquired as to what the good news was.

'You're going to Manchester United,' was the response.

What can we expect?

In an interview with fans site Vital Bolton, Kellett says he models himself on Jordi Alba and likes to get forward when he can and play on the wing. Former Wanderers boss Dougie Freedman was impressed and made him the first Bolton-born youth product to start for the club in eight years after he overcame what the Scot described as off-the-field attitude issues. Joyce has seen him in action and is impressed, and with Louis van Gaal's history of giving youth a chance, who knows what will happen next?
