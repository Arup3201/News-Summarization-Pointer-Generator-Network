Five people arrested  in the Michael Brown protests are suing Ferguson police for $40million over claims they were assaulted and brutalised with rubber bullets and tear gas.

St. Louis County and Ferguson officers have been accused of treating US citizens like 'war combatants', including one woman who was assaulted as she went to buy ice-cream.

Thousands of demonstrators have marched in the Missouri city, demanding the arrest of white police officer, Darren Wilson, who shot dead unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, earlier this month.

The lawsuit, which includes accusations of intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent supervision, and assault and battery, focuses on several arrests between August 11 and August 13.

Social worker Tracey White was buying an ice cream sundae at McDonald's when officers 'in what appeared to be army uniforms, carrying rifles and wearing helmets' ordered her to leave.

She was told to shut up, thrown to the ground and handcuffed after criticising officers for the way they were treating her 17-year-old son, according to the lawsuit.

'It was so horrifying, we did nothing wrong,' she said.

Dewayne Matthews was walking to his mother's house when a group of officers in military uniforms shot rubber bullets at him, the lawsuit alleges.

He fell into a creek or sewer, where officers 'pounced on him, slammed his face into the concrete, and pushed his head into the water to the point that he felt he was going to be drowned'.

Damon Coleman and Theophilus Green claim they were peacefully protesting when police in riot gear fired stun grenades in their direction and then 'hurled racial epithets at them, while punching and kicking them the entire time'.

And Kerry White was shooting footage and holding his camera out his car window when an officer snatched his camera, 'took out his memory card and threw it to the ground,' the lawsuit says.

'The police were completely out of control,' said attorney Malik Shabazz of Black Lawyers for Justice.

'In those initial days, it was virtually a police riot.'

The population of Ferguson is 67 percent black, but African Americans make up just 5.6 percent of the police force. 

The August 9 shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown sparked two weeks of demonstrations, some with violent clashes and scores of arrests. 

In the immediate days after Brown's shooting, local police in riot gear fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who refused to disperse and, at times, broke into nearby stores.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon eventually placed the State Highway Patrol in charge of securing Ferguson with a more relaxed approach.

He later imposed a curfew that was lifted after several nights of clashes between police and protesters, and called in the National Guard, whose members have since departed Ferguson. 

Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar, Ferguson officer Justin Cosma, several unnamed officers and the city and county governments are listed as defendants.

They did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A St. Louis County police spokesman declined to comment, referring inquiries to the county counselor's office.

The death of Michael Brown, 18, has focused global attention on the state of race relations in the United States.

It has also evoked memories of other racially charged cases, including the fatal shooting of black 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida in 2012.

Audio has been released that allegedly captures the moment Officer Darren Wilson opened fire on unarmed Michael Brown.

At least ten shots can be heard - in two separate volleys of gunfire.

St. Ann Police Chief Aaron Jimenez announced that   Lt. Ray Albers resigned on Thursday.

Albers was the police officer shown on cellphone video pointing his rifle at demonstrators on August 19 in Ferguson and threatening them.

On the video, a man is heard saying, 'Oh my God! Gun raised!' as the officer approaches. 

The officer walks near the man, gun pointed, and appears to threaten to kill him. 

A St. Louis County police sergeant forced the officer to lower the weapon and escorted him away.

It also recently emerged that a  police officer in Ferguson allowed his dog to urinate on a makeshift memorial for Michael Brown just hours after the teen was gunned down, according to a report. 

According to Mother Jones, police also drove their patrol cars over the flowers and candles Brown's mother had scattered over the place her son's body fell and laid for more than four hours, crushing them.
