The majority of first-time buyers are taking out record-breaking mortgages which last for more than 25 years, Britain’s biggest building society said yesterday.

Some of the country’s biggest lenders now hand out loans lasting for up to 40 years, an extraordinary shift from the long-held tradition that a mortgage was for only 25 years.

The longer life loans are a sign of the financial pressure on young people to buy when house prices have rocketed, although it means many will still be paying off their loan in their 70s.

Today's first-time buyers are taking out record-breaking mortgages which last for more than 25 years

Yesterday the Land Registry said the average price of a home in London has gone over £400,000 for the first time to an average of £403,792.

Seven boroughs in the capital have an average price of more than £500,000, including one where the average price is nearly £1.2million.

The Nationwide said yesterday house prices have been rising for 13 consecutive months, the longest unbroken run of monthly increase since the financial crisis began in 2007.

Matthew Pointon, a property economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, yesterday described the housing market as ‘over-heating’.

Lenders such as Halifax, Lloyds and Nationwide now have a maximum term of 40 years. Others such as Santander, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland offer loans for up to 35 years.

On average, a first-time buyer takes out a loan which lasts for 28 years, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders.

While
 the monthly repayments are cheaper, the total cost of the mortgage 
balloons because they pay much more interest on the loan.

First time high: The number of first time buyers entering the market is the highest for over 10 years

Affordability worries: House prices relative to average earnings are rising to levels not seen since 2008 creating concerns that mortgage borrowers could start to overstretch their finances

Take the example of a couple taking out a £100,000 mortgage with an interest rate of four per cent.

With a 25-year deal, their total interest bill is £58,351. With a 35-year deal, the total interest bill jumps to £85,965, according to calculations by the mortgage advisers John Charcol.

Although their monthly repayments are cheaper - £528 per month for 25 years or £443 for 35 years – the extra ten years means they are paying an additional £27,600 in interest.

Experts said the growing popularity of such longer life loans is a direct consequence of the disappearance of interest-only mortgages.

Young people used to be able to take out an interest-only mortgage, which means their monthly payments were cheaper because they were not paying off a penny of the interest.

As these types of loans have virtually disappeared, the only option is for first-time buyers to switch to a loan which a longer life.

Ray Boulger, senior technical director at John Charcol, said: ‘A loan with a longer term is the nearest thing they can get to an interest-only mortgage.’ Robert Gardner, chief economist at the Nationwide, said: ‘There is a trend towards borrowers lengthening the term of their mortgage.

Soaring: House prices have leapt nearly 9 per cent in the last 13 months figures released by Nationwide showed

‘At present, 52 per cent of mortgages [lent to first-time buyers] are currently over 25 years, up from 40 per cent in 2007.

‘This may, in part, be to lower their monthly repayments, though the shift may also reflect that people are both living and working for longer.’ These figures are based on the experience of all mortgage lenders, not just Nationwide.

Mr Boulger warned lenders’ age restrictions can cause problems for first-time buyers as many insist a loan must be fully repaid by the time a homeowner reaches 70 or 75.

For example, a 35-year-old wanting to take out a mortgage for 40 years would not be allowed to borrow the money if the lender’s age cap is 70.

Other types of buyers do not opt for longer life deals. People moving from one home to another typically take out a loan lasting for around 22 years. People remortgaging their loan typically choose an 18-year deal.

Many first-time buyers choose a longer life loan but switch to a shorter deal when they can afford the higher cost.
