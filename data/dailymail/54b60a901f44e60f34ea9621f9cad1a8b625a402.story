A spa owner has detonated two deadly First World War bombs which builders discovered in the grounds of his idyllic spa retreat as they built a new path.

Ky Wilkinson, 38, owner of the Tor Spa Retreat near Canterbury, Kent, called in bomb disposal experts after the surprise discovery who let him detonate the 25lb explosives himself.

It comes after he had diced with death after moving one of the devices by hand, unaware he could have been blown to pieces.

Sounds of war: Explosives were moved by the Royal Logistics Cops into field before being detonated

Builders discovered the first 25lb shell as they dug a new pathway at Mr Wilkinson's spa near Ickham, Kent.

They alerted him and he picked it up before carefully laying it back in the ground where it had lay hidden since the First World War.

Experts from the Royal Logistic Corps then dug a trench and covered the rusting explosive with sandbags in preparation for detonating the warhead.

They handed the detonator to Mr Wilkinson, allowing him to trigger the explosion from a safe distance.

Thinking the coast was clear, Mr Wilkinson, went back to work at the Tor Spa Retreat.

But the next day the builders working on site made a second discovery.

The army were called back and once again, experts gave Mr Wilkinson the satisfaction of pressing the button for a second time.

Locals in the nearby hamlet where Great British Bake Off judge Paul Hollywood has a home were alerted to the explosions.

The shells are thought to be nearly 100 years old and were thought to be dropped during training exercises during the First World War.

Mr Wilkinson said: 'As a business owner I was obviously worried about the fact I could get closed down for having unexploded bombs on my site.

'So when I got to detonate them myself it was a good feeling and good therapy I guess.

'Itâ€™s incredible to think I picked the first one up before I knew how dangerous it might be.'
