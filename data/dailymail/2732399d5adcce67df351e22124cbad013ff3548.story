Paris Jackson and her brother Prince Michael have spoken out publicly a number of times since their father died but now their youngest brother Blanket has joined them.

Blanket, who is now 11 years old, took part in a pay-per-view documentary called Remembering Our Michael that their grandmother Katherine Jackson created for paying fans, which promises to give some of Jackson's biggest supporters a glimpse of the children talking about their father.

During his segments, Blanket described his passion for animals which stems from his early life surrounded by exotic creatures at Neverland Ranch.

His father's legacy: Prince Michael II, known by his nickname Blanket, spoke about how his early introduction to exotic animals prompted his interest in Africa and endangered species 

'We lived in kind of like a zoo basically- (there were) giraffes, lions,' Blanket said.

'You probably heard of it but yeah we had a chimp named Bubbles,' he said of the singer's famous chimpanzee.

That exposure to African animals has apparently prompted an interest in their homeland as he apparently wants to help put an end to poaching. 

'I just want to help Africa because that's a very poor continent,' Blanket said.

The last time we saw him: Blanket kept his face covered at his father's 2009 funeral

'There's a lot of animals being killed by poachers and stuff so I want to help endangered species of animals.'

Michael's father estranged father Joe
 Jackson was included in the documentary. Michael had spoken out about 
how his father abused him as a child and would regularly whip him during
 rehearsals, though he credited that incessant work ethic as the reason 
why he was so successful.

Now Joe appears to have his eyes set 
on another member of the Jackson family as being bound for stardom, 
saying in the documentary that he was told by a fortune teller that 
Blanket is bound for greatness.

'They said there would never be 
another Michael Jackson and I say we already have one. I said he just 
has to be trained. That kid is the spitting image of Michael when he was
 smaller,' Joe Jackson said.

The wedding: Michael Jackson married his nurse Debbie Rowe when she was six months pregnant with his son Prince Michael I (seen here at their 1996 wedding), and the couple went on to have daughter Paris a year later

'(The fortune teller) said that boy there is going to be the biggest entertainer in the world.'

Blanket has expressed an interest in his father's career path, recalling how he had an early interest in his dad's skills.

'Sometimes I would go in his room and watch videos of him dancing,' Blanket said.

His older sister Paris acknowledged that their unusual upbringing may have had it's own set of drawbacks.

'We didn't know a lot of kids our age.
 We were more secluded, we never really left the ranch that often,' she 
said of their life before Michael's 2009 death.

She defended his decision to keep the children in a world of their own, saying: 'There are a lot of bad people out there ... (but he) always wanted a taste normal life.'

Paris has had the most trouble publicly since her father's death, as she was hospitalized following a suicide attempt when she slit her wrist and took pills.

She has since reunited with her biological mother, Debbie Rowe, who said that Paris was having trouble connecting with her younger brother and her grandmother following Michael's death.

Paris is currently getting treatment at a therapeutic boarding school in Utah, though she was still able to participate in the making of the documentary.

'He promised he would teach me how to moonwalk- never got around to it,' she said of her father's signature dance move.

'I really hope his legacy lives on forever. I will never forget him ever. He was amazing.'

Prince Michael is Jackson's eldest son with Rowe, who he met because she worked as his dermatologist's assistant.

Rowe and Jackson married when she was six months pregnant with Prince, and they went on to have Paris a year later.

The couple split a year later and Jackson was awarded full custody of the children.

Concern: Blanket said that he wants to help stop the damage done by poachers in Africa

Animal lover: Michael made headlines when he bought 'Bubbles' the chimpanzee in 1987

In 2002, Blanket was born via artificial insemination and his surrogate mother's identity remains a secret.

Prince Michael, who is now 16, spoke the most lovingly about his father, saying that he had no idea who his father really was until he was about six years old because he just knew him as daddy.

'He wanted us to always be what we wanted to be, just be greater at it than anyone else had ever been,' Prince Michael said.
