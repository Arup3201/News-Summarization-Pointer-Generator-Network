Arsenal want to snap up a central defender before the transfer deadline - with Aston Villa's Ron Vlaar a surprise target.

The exit of former Gunners captain Thomas Vermaelen to Barcelona has left Wenger light on defensive cover.

Wenger will have to convince Vlaar, who starred at the World Cup, to join a club where he could theoretically be fourth in the pecking order.

Wanted: Arsene Wenger wants to sign the 29-year-old Dutch centre-back from Aston Villa

Persuasion: The Villa defender is yet to be convinced about the move as he would not be first choice at Arsenal

Out-of-favour Manchester City defender Matija Nastasic is also wanted by boss Arsene Wenger.

The Gunners could face competition were they to bid for Nastasic, with French sides Lille and Marsielle both interested in the Serb.

Whether City would sell to Arsenal, a direct Premier League rival, remains to be seen.

The 21-year-old starred in his first Premier League season but was a more peripheral figure during the title-winning campaign last term.

Rising star: Nastasic is highly rated but has been hampered by injuries during his short Man City career
