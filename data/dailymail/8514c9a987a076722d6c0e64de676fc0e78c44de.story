Gunmen fired indiscriminately at homes, burned down a church and raided a police station in two attacks on Kenyan coastal towns overnight, killing at least 29 people.

Twenty of the victims were killed in an attack in the Gamba area of Tana River county, where gunmen rushed the police station and freed suspected al-Shabab militants.

Another nine were killed in a separate raid at the Hindi trading centre in neighbouring Lamu county, near the town of Mpeketoni where 65 people were killed last month.

The Somali Islamist militant group 
al-Shabab, which last September attacked the Westgate shopping mall in 
Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, claimed responsibility for the attacks.

Mwenda
 Njoka, a spokesman for the interior ministry, told Reuters: 'There were
 two attacks in Lamu and Tana River last night. In Lamu we have nine 
people dead and in Tana River we have 20. The number could rise.'

Sheikh
 Abdiasis Abu Musab, al Shabaab's military operations spokesman, told 
Reuters in Mogadishu that the Somali group was behind both attacks on 
Saturday night.

It had also said it was responsible for the June raids in Lamu County, around Mpeketoni.

But
 President Uhuru Kenyatta dismissed al-Shabab's claim last month and 
blamed local politicians, stoking an already fierce row with the 
opposition, which denied any role.

Regardless
 of who is blamed this time, the violence will hammer an already 
beleaguered tourist industry that has been hit by a wave of militant 
attacks.

And they will 
deepen public frustrations about poor security in Kenya a day before a 
big opposition rally is planned for the capital.

At
 a news conference, police deputy inspector general Grace Kaindi said a 
blackboard, ripped out of a school, was found at a junction near Hindi 
with scrawling that could implicate the coastal separatist group, the 
Mombasa Republic Movement (MRC).

'At
 first we thought it was al Shabaab, but now it is turning out that it 
is MRC as they have put it there clearly,' she said, adding other 
scribbled phrases seemed to back opposition leader Raila Odinga.

Slogans included 'MRC - You are sleeping,' 'Muslims your land is being grabbed', 'Raila is adequate' and 'Uhuru down'.

The
 MRC swiftly denied any role. 'The government should stop using us as a 
scapegoat,' Randu Nzai Ruwa, the MRC Secretary General, told Reuters by 
telephone.

Officials said a 
group of 10-15 men struck at Hindi, situated nine miles from the town of
 Lamu, and close to the town of Mpeketoni, which was nearly destroyed in
 one of the attacks in June, at about 10 pm on Saturday.

'They went around shooting at people and villages indiscriminately,' Abdallah Shahasi, the area chief, told Reuters.

Al-Shabab
 announced that at the same time it had broken into the police station 
at Gamba and freed suspects from the detention cells. A Kenyan police 
source, who asked not to be named, corroborated that account.

He
 told Reuters: 'They killed some of our colleagues and freed Muslim 
detainees. Some of those freed were linked to the Mpeketoni attacks two 
weeks ago.

'We still don't know how many detainees were freed until we verify with registers at the station.'

A
 senior police source who also asked to remain anonymous told the 
Associated Press that the nine victims of the raid included five inmates
 said to be non-Muslim. He said three other inmates escaped with the 
gunmen.

The officer said the
 gunmen got to the police station by car-jacking a truck and killing its
 three occupants. Five police officers were wounded in the attack and 
one officer was killed, he said.

Miiri
 Njenga, the Lamu county commissioner, said the attackers targeted 
government offices and some properties, including a church, were burned 
down.

Lamu County police chief Ephantus Kariuki said victims were shot in the head with their hands bound.

'It
 seems the attacks are more associated with land disputes and 
resources,' he told Reuters, speaking of a region where rival ethnic 
groups have long rowed over land ownership.

The
 Kenyan Red Cross said three people were taken to hospital with 
injuries, from both areas, adding another one was reported missing in 
Gamba.

Militant attacks on 
the coast have fanned an already tense political atmosphere in Kenya, 
which has sent troops to join African troops battling al-Shabab in 
neighbouring Somalia.

Veteran
 opposition leader Odinga, defeated by Kenyatta in last year's election,
 has held rallies over the past month criticising the government over 
frequent militant attacks.

Kenyatta
 stepped into an already heated debate by accusing local politicians of 
being behind strikes on Mpeketoni. Opponents saw his statement as 
fingering Odinga, who has promised a major rally on Monday in Nairobi.

Religious
 leaders have urged Kenyans to avoid rallies that could deepen divisions
 in a nation scarred by political violence in the recent past. Political
 allegiances in Kenya tend to follow ethnic lines.

The
 nation is haunted by the 2007 presidential election, when 1,200 died in
 weeks of ethnic blood-letting - over which Kenyatta still faces trial 
at The Hague this year for crimes against humanity.

However, last year's vote went off calmly.
