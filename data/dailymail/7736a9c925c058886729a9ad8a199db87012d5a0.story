Georgetown became the first college sports team to stage an 'I Can't Breathe' T-shirt demonstration to protest the chokehold death of Eric Garner.

The entire basketball team emerged for the final warmups before their loss to No. 10 Kansas in Washington DC on Wednesday night wearing black short-sleeve T-shirts with the three words in bold white letters.

The players wore the T-shirts during the national anthem while lined up across the court. They then shook hands with the Jayhawks before taking off the shirts for the announcement of the starting lineups.

A number of professional athletes, including LeBron James and Kobe Bryant, have written the message on their warmups or other equipment over the past few days.

The message echoes the last words spoken by Eric Garner as police were attempting to arrest him in New York in July, and has become a rallying cry at protests across the United States.

Last week, a Staten Island grand jury had decided not to indict white NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo for his role in  Garner's death last July, sparking demonstrations across the country.

The protests crossed the Atlantic Thursday, as demonstrators staged a mass die-in at Westfield shopping centre in London, in solidarity with the recent events surrounding the deaths Eric Garner and Michael Brown - the black teenager shot dead in Ferguson.

After the game in Washington DC, Hoyas coach John Thompson III gave a detailed, eloquent explanation for the T-shirts.

He said it was a player-driven idea that had its origins after the team watched the grand jury decision concerning Michael Brown  live on television while in the Bahamas for a holiday tournament.

The coach said the players initially wanted to wear the shirts at the  previous game, but he first wanted to have more conversations with them to make sure they all understood the answer to the question: 'Why do you want to wear this shirt?'

'You can go from Patrick Ewing wearing a T-shirt underneath his jersey, then it becomes something that everyone does,' Thompson III said. 

'Allen Iverson braiding his hair and playing in the league, then it becomes something everyone does. Kobe wearing the tights and then everyone does it.

'And this isn't that. This isn't one of those things where you go along just because it's something that's trending. 

'We have had a lot of discussions, and the emotions as it relates to the protest the guys wanted to do today, the emotions and the feelings in the locker room are all over the place, meaning not necessarily everyone feels the same way.

He added: 'The emotions are from fear to frustration to confusion to anger, and the reasons why every individual wanted to wear it is all over the place, too, which is probably pretty consistent with the emotions across the country right now.

'I think the group wanted to possibly put ourselves in the position to be a part of a process, to help where there's positive change, as opposed to just negative reactions.'

Junior guard D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera referenced the names of Brown and Trayvon Martin as he spoke about the protest, saying it goes beyond one case in New York.

'We really wanted to represent those families that all lost (a loved) one,' he said.

Senior center Joshua Smith: 'We didn't wear the shirts to say that the cops were wrong or the system was wrong. 

'We just wore the shirts just to show our condolences to the family because no matter how you look at it, we don't know who was right or wrong, but they still lost somebody. And they won't get that person back.'

Thompson III's father, longtime Hoyas coach John Thompson Jr., was known for taking bold positions during a his career, especially in support of minorities.

Most famously, the elder Thompson walked off the court before a home game in 1989 to protest NCAA Proposition 42, which restricted the criteria under which athletes could receive scholarships.

When Thompson III was asked about his father's legacy of speaking his mind, the elder Thompson spoke up from the back of the room.

'It's a (expletive) school, man,' Thompson Jr. said. 'That's your responsibility to deal with things like that. We're not a ... damn pro team.'

Kansas freshman guard Kelly Oubre was impressed by the Georgetown players' stand.

'That's definitely a powerful statement that those guys collectively made,' Oubre said. 'I respect them for doing that, and they did it all as a team, too, so it was something good to watch.'

Jayhawks coach Bill Self did not see the protest because he was focused on preparing for the game, but he also supported the players' action.

'It's a pretty strong stance,' he said. 'And I think it's pretty good, and it certainly shows a lot of solidarity amongst their unit. And I don't see anything negative with it at all.'
