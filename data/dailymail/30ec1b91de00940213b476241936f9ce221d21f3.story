Jan Vertonghen has issued a plea to manager Mauricio Pochettino for more appearances and spoken of his desire to ‘one day play 60 games again’.

The Belgian has been in and out of the side this season with club captain Younes Kaboul and new signing Federico Fazio generally preferred at centre-back in the Premier League. 

Vertonghen has played every minute of Spurs’ Europa League campaign but only started six of their 11 games in the league. One of those came when Fazio was suspended.

Vertonghen, who will captain his country against Wales in the absence of Vincent Kompany, said: 'I want to play every game but this manager, Pochettino, has a different approach, he likes to give everyone the time to play and settle in.

'Hopefully one day I can play 60 games a season again, but at the moment, that is not the case.

‘My season has been ups and downs like Tottenham itself. I started the season with an injury after the World Cup. I came into the team in the second or third game and then I got dropped again.

Mauricio Pochettino has started Vertonghen in six of Spur's 11 games in the Premier League this season 

'Compared to the other two seasons at Spurs, we now have similar quality centre-backs. Kaboul is now fit and he is our captain. They bought Fazio and he is an Argentina international and (Vlad) Chiriches is the Romanian captain.’ 

Vertonghen also backed Ben Davies, his rival in their Euro 2016 qualifier, to seize the left-back spot at Spurs in future. The summer signing from Swansea has only played 18 minutes in the Premier League this season.

'I played some games with him on a Thursday,’ said Vertonghen, dryly. 'Of course you want to play in the Premier League and he’s a very good player.

'He’s doing very well. But Danny Rose is one of the best left-backs in the Premier League at the moment. Ben is 21 and has the time to improve.

'He's a very good left-back and he can be number one left-back at Spurs one day. 100 per cent that day will come. He has the qualities.'
