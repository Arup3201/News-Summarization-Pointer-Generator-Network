Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers and his new girlfriend headed up a pack of the club's stars and their WAGs on a night out in the city to celebrate a players birthday.

The pair were seen smiling and laughing as they made their way into Secret nightclub in Liverpool city centre on Tuesday night to celebrate player Martin Skrtel's 30th birthday.  

Mr Rodgers and his girlfriend Charlotte Searle, formerly Hind, were both smartly dressed for the occasion - with the results of Mr Rodgers' dramatic image overhaul evident.

The Liverpool manager split from his wife of 12 years Susan, mother of his two children, over a year ago.  

Since taking on one of the top jobs in football, the 41-year-old has apparently had his teeth whitened and lost a noticeable amount of weight through sessions in the club gym, as well as moving from the family home into a £1.2million flat.

He has since started a relationship with mother-of one Ms Searle, 31, who used to work at Liverpool FC as a travel coordinator. 

The glamorous blonde, who has a young daughter with former husband Steven Hind, was wearing a pale pink coat accessorised with nude heels. The night out to an official club function has appeared to cement their public status as a couple.

Her hair was swept into a smart ponytail and she carried a small rectangular black clutch bag. 

Northern Irishman Mr Rodgers, who has developed a somewhat warmer glow to his skin since he joined the club, was wearing a charcoal grey blazer and trousers, paired with trainers. 

Also on the night out was captain Steven Gerrard who is expected to finalise his transfer to US team LA Galaxy today. 

The 34-year-old Liverpool captain has agreed an 18-month contract, worth £3.9million a year, to move to California and will start playing in the MLS when their mid-season transfer window opens in July.

Summer signings Lazar Markovic, Alberto Moreno and Rickie Lambert were also in attendance along with defenders Glen Johnson, Luis Enrique and Javier Manquillo. 

Gerrard revealed he had turned down offers from clubs in the Barclays Premier League, Europe and the Middle East.

But he also revealed he would have committed his future to Liverpool had they offered to extend his terms when he retired from England.

When he ended his England career after the World Cup, it was with the intention of committing to Liverpool for the next ‘two or three years’ but an offer did not arrive until last November.

‘If a contract had been put in front of me in pre-season I would have signed it,’ Gerrard told the Liverpool Echo. ‘I’d just retired from England to concentrate on Liverpool.

‘I didn’t want my club games to be tailored. My injury record had been fantastic for the past two-and-a-half years and I had a great season from a personal point of view last season. 

‘It is all ifs, buts and hindsight now. That period between the summer and the end of November gave me thinking time. There’s no blame and I’m not angry about it.

‘There are other people in the squad and the club had other things to worry about. Liverpool FC have been unbelievable for me since I was eight. This club has helped me fulfil my dreams.’  

Manager Rodgers had wanted to keep Gerrard at Anfield and the iconic midfielder insisted again that the decision to part was amicable; he made his decision after Rodgers revealed he would be tailoring his game time next season.
