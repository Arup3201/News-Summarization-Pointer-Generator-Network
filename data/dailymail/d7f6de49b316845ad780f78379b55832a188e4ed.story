Comedian Russell Kane has taken the Edinburgh Festival to new heights by performing a stand-up gig on a plane at 35,000ft.

Kane, 33, who presents the BBC Three comedy series Live at the Electric, entertained passengers during their flight to Edinburgh from London Heathrow on Friday.

His unique 10-minute show - dubbed the 'wry-high club' - transformed the Virgin Atlantic Little Red flight into the Edinburgh Festival Fringe's 300th venue.

Joking around: Kane looked excited to  be boarding the special flight to Edinburgh

The airline laid on the surprise 'Little Red LIVE' gig to warm-up comedy lovers on their way to the festival and give those who can't attend a giggle.

Russell shot to fame in 2006 when he performed his debut comedy show at the Edinburgh Fringe, which resulted in an Edinburgh Comedy award nomination.

Since then, the Essex-based comedian has performed in front of thousands of fans, including a packed Hammersmith Apollo for the BBC's popular comedy programme Live at the Apollo.

He was also nominated for the Edinburgh Comedy Awards at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, winning the main prize in August 2010.

And his one-of-a-kind performance brightened up the Virgin Atlantic Little Red flight, which set off from Heathrow at 11.20am and arrived north of the border at 12.40pm.

Captive audience: Once on board the comedian took charge of the PA system

The energetic comedian was worried about standing still for the show but the audience seemed to lap it up

Before take off, Kane tweeted: 'Apparently @beckieboom I have to speak into the @VirginAtlantic plane's in-flight PA system. I'LL HAVE TO STAND STILL. Waahhh'

He later posted several 'selfies' with members of the crew and passengers before sending a message to the airline's owner Sir Richard Branson that said: 'I've been flirting with your staff @richardbranson @VirginAtlantic #LittleRedLive'

Russell is the first of four comedians to take to the skies for 'Little Red LIVE' during August.

Funnymen Carl Donnelly, Tom Craine and Richard Herring will also perform to a packed plane on August 8, 15 and 22 respectively.

Sir Richard's service runs from London Heathrow to Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Manchester.

Sir Richard said: 'To follow the success of the first on-board live performances in 2013, we're providing our passengers with another great line-up of comedy gigs in true Virgin Atlantic style.

'This ensures we offer an unforgettable and inimitable flying experience. Virgin Atlantic Live: On Air reinforces again why our customer service is second to none.'

The 2014 Fringe will see 49,497 performances of 3,193 shows in 299 venues across Scotland’s capital city.

According to organisers, the number of shows reflects an 11 per cent increase on last year’s programme, making it the biggest ever in the history of the Fringe.
