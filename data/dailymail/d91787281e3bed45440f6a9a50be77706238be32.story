Sir Bradley Wiggins has been added to Team Sky's line-up for Sunday's Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic, becoming the first former Tour de France winner to take part in the event.

Wiggins, who took silver for England in the team pursuit at the Commonwealth Games, will join fellow Britons Ben Swift, Luke Rowe and Ian Stannard in Sky's six-man team for the 200km race, which will also feature the likes of 2012 world champion Philippe Gilbert and leading sprinters Mark Renshaw, Alessandro Petacchi and Elia Viviani.

The event will see Wiggins return to the roads where he won Olympic time trial gold in 2012 and mark his first appearance in London since he took victory in last year's Tour of Britain.

'The Prudential RideLondon-Surrey Classic enjoys great support from spectators at the roadside across the route and this announcement means fans can now look forward to seeing one of the greatest ever British cyclists racing in the event.'
