Coming 
second in the list of legendary trips by leaders in sport is Andy 
Murray's departure to the USA, according to the survey of 2,000 people by Heathrow airport.

Historian Dominic Sandbrook, said: 'Britain has always been a land of explorers and entertainers, inventors and innovators. It's no surprise to see the great landmarks from international sport on the list.

'But I think the public's choices also reflect our historic strengths in everything from philanthropy and popular culture to science and technology.

'It's a valuable reminder that we're at our best when we face outwards, as a nation of international ambitions and global horizons.'

John Holland-Kaye, Heathrow's Development Director said: 'For 70 years, Heathrow has witnessed amazing departures and welcomed an array of British talent back home.

'The many iconic journeys in sport that feature in the top ten all demonstrate how important it is to have a world class hub directly connecting the UK to future international success.'
