The disgraced son of socialite Brooke Astor will be jailed after New York's highest court turned down his plea for an appeal against his conviction on charges of 
plundering his mother's millions.

Anthony Marshall, 88, faces up to three years behind bars  for attempting to con his late philanthropist mother's estate out of $60million.

He had petitioned the Court of Appeals to overturn his 2009 conviction, but Judge Robert Smith denied the appeal, a spokesman revealed.

A New York state appeals court has upheld the conviction of Anthony Marshall, who was found guilty in 2009 of siphoning off millions of dollars from the estate of his mother, philanthropist and socialite Brooke Astor

Conviction upheld: Anthony Marshall, son of late philanthropist Brooke Astor, sits in Manhattan Supreme Court where opening arguments were delivered in his trial

Astor died on August 13, 2007, at the age of 105

The parties were notified by mail last week and Marshall has to surrender for execution of sentencing on June 17. Judge Smith did not explain his decision, the New York Post reported.

Marshall, 88, has been outcast by New 
York society since he was convicted of conning his philanthropist mother
Brooke Astor out of $60 million in 2009.

He and wife Charlene have kept
to a frugal life of solitude in their Upper East Side apartment  during the appeals process and they have rarely seen in public 
as he awaits his one to three year sentence.

A lower court judge wrote in March that he took advantage of Astor 'when they knew her physical and mental condition' were deteriorated.

Vast wealth: Brooke Astor's Westchester home - most of the furniture was auctioned at Sotheby's last year and the proceeds went to philanthropic causes in New York City

Taken: While the furniture was initially given to Marshall from Brooke Astor's will, he will now not see any of the money after being found guilty of defrauding the elderly woman

Marshall also gave himself a $2million pay raise and bought a 55ft long yacht with his mother's money.

The wheelchair-bound son had begged judges to spare him the jail time given his age, health, military service and lack of prior criminal history.

Marshall is in poor health following open heart surgery, is estranged from his twin sons.

Setting sail: The Titanic leaving Southampton on her ill-fated maiden voyage on April 10, 1912

John Jacob Astor IV was a millionaire 
and decorated Spanish-American war hero who died in the sinking of the 
Titanic in 1912

John Jacob Astor has become one of the most fabled characters to emerge from the 1,517 passengers who died when the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912.

The 47-year-old American tycoon, who built the Astoria Hotel in New York, was returning from his honeymoon on the doomed vessel with his 19-year-old pregnant wife Madeleine.

When the Titanic struck the iceberg, Astor helped his wife into a lifeboat but remained onboard. He was last seen smoking a cigarette on the top deck.

Half an hour later, the ship slipped beneath the ocean waves. His wife survived.

Astor's was one of the 333 bodies recovered on April 22 by a cable ship. He was identified by the initials sewn into his jacket along with his engraved gold watch.  

Astor's son Vincent inherited the piece and wore it for the rest of his life before passing it on to his son, Anthony.

JJ Astor is buried in Trinity Church Cemetery in New York City. Madeleine gave birth to a son on August 14, 1912 who was named after his father.

They testified that their father and 
stepmother were abusing Astor, withholding medical treatment and leaving
her to lie drenched in her own urine.

Marshall was found guilty of 
defrauding his mother out of money she had inherited from her 
third husband, hotelier and realtor Vincent Astor.

Vincent Astor's father John Jacob Astor IV famously died on the Titanic after it sank on April 15, 1912, and he was the one to go claim 
his father's body in Nova Scotia after the wreck.

Brooke Astor, who died in 2007 aged 
105, had devoted her life to philanthropy, giving eye-watering sums of 
money to the St Regis Hotel, the New York Public Library and the 
Metropolitan Art Museum.

The multimillionaire, who had 
Alzheimer's, was left to spend her last days in heart-breaking 
conditions - her dogs messing over her Park Avenue apartment while she 
napped in her own urine with no one to help, the Post previously 
reported.

The jury convicted Marshall of 14 counts, including first-degree grand larceny and scheming to defraud.

Marshall
did not appear to have learned a lesson from his conviction. In March, 
Marshall was allegedly hawking a fake gold watch that he claimed 
belonged to his famous relative who died on the Titanic.

He and his current wife Charlene made
a rare public appearance three months ago at a lavish party for a new cruise 
ship called the Titanic II.

At the party, he reportedly showed 
guests a gold watch that reportedly belonged to John Jacob Astor and was
trying to sell it for $1million.

However, the story was claimed to be 
the 88-year-old's latest con, as a California collector has said that he
bought the real watch in an auction over a decade ago.
