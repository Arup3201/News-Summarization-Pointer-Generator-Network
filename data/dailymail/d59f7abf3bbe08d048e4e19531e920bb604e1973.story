It’s supposed to be the happiest day of a couple's life, when everything goes according to plan.

But things clearly went wrong for some newlyweds in the cake department, as shown by these hilarious pictures of wonky creations uploaded onto the Cake Wrecks blog in Florida.

One of the cakes cannot even stand up, others appear completely lacking in any creativity or artistic craft and another has the words 'I do' stuck on top with an awfully bland design on the cake itself.

Other amusing photos show how cake-makers failed when trying to experiment with clashing colours.

Scary: This creation posted on the Cake Wrecks blog in Orlando, Florida, looks more like an evil monster

Awful: The cake on the left has a horrendous colour scheme and the creation on the right seems to be cracking

Flowery: The cake on the left has an amazing amount of flowers on top, while the one on the right is just bland

Poor: The decoration is falling off this horrendous cake, which would have surely left the newlyweds upset

Just bad: The cake on the left is in need of some surgery, while the one on the right just looks plain awful

Splodge: Something has also gone wrong with both of these cakes, posted on the Cake Wrecks blog in the U.S.
