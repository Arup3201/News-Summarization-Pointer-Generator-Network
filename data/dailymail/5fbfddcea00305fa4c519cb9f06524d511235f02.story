He is still two months away from his official debut but Luis Suarez already knows how it feels to hear the Camp Nou chant his name. Now begins the difficult task of watching from the sidelines until October 25 as his new team-mates start the season without him.

The former Liverpool striker was finally presented to Barcelona supporters at the Camp Nou on Monday night before Barça's 6-0 win over FC Leon, five weeks after signing for the club, and four days after his Fifa ban on all football activity was lifted.

An hour before the club's final pre-season friendly kicked off the stadium was predictably still less than half full but the roar was still huge and his name was chanted as he trotted out wearing the number nine shirt.

Suarez was named among the substitutes alongside other big names such as Xavi, Gerard Pique and Alex Song for the Joan Gamper trophy but unlike those three he did take full part in the warm-up with the substitutes making the most of every second on the Camp Nou turf.

He finally made his entrance against the Mexican side captained by former Barcelona defender Rafa Marquez on 76 minutes replacing Rafinha, by which time Barcelona were already 4-0 ahead and had  made nine changes.

Messi scored after three minutes from a Neymar pass and Neymar netted on 12 minutes after a brilliant through ball from Andres Iniesta. Neymar made it three, two minutes before the break when beating FC Leon’s offside trap he ran on to a Messi pass, flicked the ball past William Yardbrough in the visitor’s goal and then with an outrageous back-heel found the back of the empty net.

The Brazilian was taken off at half-time after his first 45 minutes since cracking a vertebrae but it was El Haddadi Munir who replaced him and not Suarez.

The pace slowed considerably in the second half and Suarez looked on as the fourth was scored by the youngster Munir who could now even start in attack at the weekend as Barcelona take on Elche. He confirmed his status as top scorer in pre-season converting Dani Alves’ cross after the Brazilian had been picked up by Rakitic’s perfect pass.

Suarez came on with 14 minutes left but was joining the applause before he could really join the action as Munir scored again to make it 5-0 this time from a Sandro pass. Sandro completed the rout on the whistle scoring to make it 6-0.

There were several neat passes from Suarez but there was a decidedly pre-season air to that last quarter of an hour just as there had been pre-match when he was introduced along with the entire squad to what was still a half empty stadium.

New coach Luis Enrique was first out to a back-drop of fireworks and applause. His squad followed him one by one with right-back Martin Montoya introduced first followed by Pedro and Pique.

The volume increased considerably when Neymar and Mascherano – two of the Barcelona players who did themselves justice at the World Cup – trotted out to the centre-circle.

Marc-Andre Ter Stegen was the first new signing to be called on to the pitch followed by returning loanee Rafinha, Ivan Rakitic, young goalkeeper Jordi Masip, Chile keeper Claudio Bravo, defenders Jeremy Mathieu and Thomas Vermaelen and to the biggest cheer of the night Suarez.

The captains Sergi Busquets, Messi, Andre Iniesta and Xavi were also roared on to the field before Xavi took the microphone and welcomed Suarez and the rest of the new signings to the club.

With his first game under his belt and the Gamper Trophy presented to the team, he disappeared down the tunnel a happy man – now for the 11 matches he will take no part in. Followed by that small matter of a competitive debut against Real Madrid on October 26.
