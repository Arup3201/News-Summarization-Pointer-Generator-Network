The purchase of Salford City by Manchester United’s Class of ’92 is causing concern among rival teams because of the money being spent.

Salford, which is being acquired by the quintet of Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and the Neville brothers, are said to be paying new striker Gareth Seddon, 34, who was signed from Conference side Chester, £600 a week.

This is pocket money in the rarefied football world in which the United five plied their trade, but an unprecedented amount in the Evo-Stik Division One North of the Northern Premier League, the eighth tier of English football.

Most other teams in that League wouldn’t spend much more than that on their entire squad, leading to fears that the Class of ’92 intend to buy their way into the Football League.

A Northern League spokesman said: ‘It’s a lot of money for this division but the United investors have said they’re in no hurry and intend to build up the team slowly with a mixture of young and experienced players.’

Whatever the issue, FIFA like to blame the English press.

Secretary-general Jerome Valcke said his most difficult moment of the seven-year build-up to the World Cup came after telling a handful of reporters at Pennyhill Park Hotel in Surrey two years ago that the Brazilian organisers needed a ‘kick up the backside’.

Valcke said: ‘That episode was the worst because it created such a reaction and the situation became difficult for me.’

Former Australia paceman Brett Lee, who bowled off about 18 yards when maiming Piers  Morgan in the Melbourne nets, had a fascinating verbal exchange with Shane Warne after breaking his hand with a beamer at Lord’s at the weekend.

Warne, who incidentally was an amused onlooker when Morgan was being peppered, said: ‘What the **** were you doing?’ ‘Trying to bowl a fast yorker,’ replied Lee. ‘Why?’ said Warne, who is enduring more bad luck in a Las Vegas poker tournament.

Contracts have been struck in Asia as well as North and South America for a book due out at the end of September. Headline are understood to have paid a £400,000 advance for the rights.

ECB chiefs back Cook

There is absolutely no appetite at the top of the ECB to dispense with beleaguered captain Alastair Cook even if he fails badly in the forthcoming series against India.

Indeed, ECB chief executive David Collier, when asked how many more Tests could he see Cook leading out  England, replied: ‘Another 80.’

However, Collier and chairman Giles Clarke were just as supportive of England team director Andy Flower before he fell on his sword. So Cook, who was highly fortunate to survive the Ashes fiasco, might have to do the same.

It has emerged that FA grandee David Elleray made his racist remark to referee coaching manager Robert McCarthy in front of 15 people after arriving for dinner at St George’s Park.

The FA, who merely rapped Elleray over the knuckles, insist McCarthy, who is black, made no official complaint after being told: ‘You look rather tanned, have you been down a coalmine?’

But the FA employee was said to be furious with Elleray afterwards. There is also upset at the way witness evidence of the incident was seemingly ignored.

Former England captain David Gower has finally declared himself part of the opposition fighting the MCC committee in a torturous civil war over the development of Lord’s.

The Sky presenter was said to be backing the rebels last year before changing his mind.

But Gower has now put his influential signature to a letter reflecting ‘deep concern over the governance processes of MCC’ and calling for more consideration of the £100million cash offer for property development at the Nursery End.
