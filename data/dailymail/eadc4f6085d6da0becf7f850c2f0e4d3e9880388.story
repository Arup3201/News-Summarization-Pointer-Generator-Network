The gap between British boys and girls in school science performance is one of the biggest in the world, figures show.

Boys in the UK are outperforming girls by 13 percentage points in international tests, while the average gap across other participating countries is just one point.

Author Shirley Conran, adviser to the Government on girls, blamed sexism and poor teaching, telling the Sunday Times: ‘Maths and science are a feminist issue. It is a myth that boys are better at them than girls.’

Physicist and TV presenter Brian Cox said girls formed a ‘great reservoir of untapped talent’ but were getting the impression that science was ‘male-dominated and not for them’.

The report, due to be published by the OECD next week, ranks Britain in the bottom five for gender equality in science, just above Colombia and alongside Costa Rica.

The gap in Colombia is 18 points and the UK is one of four countries with gaps of between 10 and 15 points.

Experts said the narrow gap in other countries proved that girls could perform as well as boys – but simply were not reaching their potential in the UK.

They said the tests suggested girls were being denied the chance to access to well-paid science jobs because they were being held back at school.

In some countries in the rankings, including Finland and Singapore, girls performed as well as boys in science or even better.

Pupils in 67 countries took Pisa international tests in maths, science and reading at the age of 15.

British boys taking part in the 2012 Pisa tests did better than girls in maths by 12 percentage points, one point higher than the OECD average gap.

Girls meanwhile outperformed boys by 25 points in reading; the OECD average was 35 points higher for girls.

Andreas Schleicher, OECD special adviser on education, said there was ‘no biological reason for girls to do badly.’

He added: ‘It’s not the case that boys are good at science and girls at reading, that’s just not true. People say boys are better at maths and science and girls at reading but there is simply no evidence from our research to support that.

‘Aged 9 and 10, both girls and boys in the UK think science is really interesting; by age 15 girls in the UK think it is really boring.

‘The study choices girls are making do not lead to the best-paid occupations. Too many schools are not giving them the answers to why are we studying this, what jobs will it lead to, what life opportunities it is opening up.

'There is a lot of work to do in terms of attitudes, expectations and careers for girls. Parents can play a part in tackling these social and emotional factors and so can teachers.’

Experts said one solution currently under consideration is the introduction of ‘gender policies’ in schools which would challenge assumptions about suitable roles for girls and boys.

They said phrases like ‘man up’ could be considered sexist but are often used by teachers and in the playground. 

A Department for Education spokesperson said: ‘Last year as many girls as boys achieved grade C and above in science GCSEs and the number of girls taking physics A-level has gone up by almost 1,000 in the last four years. In the same period, the number of girls taking biology and chemistry have also risen significantly.

‘Developing the best schools and skills is a key part of our plan for education, and the skills taught by subjects like maths and science are some of those most valued by employers and universities.'
