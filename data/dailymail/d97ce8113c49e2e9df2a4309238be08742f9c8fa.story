The mother of an alleged carjacker charged with killing three children in an SUV crash has turned down a $110,000 reward for making him turn himself in, it is claimed.

Jonathan Rosa, 19, was interviewed by police after his phone was found in the back seat of the car which hit the children on Friday at a fruit stand in North Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

But they let him go after he claimed it had been stolen, and it was only on Sunday - after speaking to his mother - that he handed himself to police.

Third victim: Keiearra Williams, 15 (left and right) was standing with her two brothers at the time of the crash

They charged him and 22-year-old Cornelius Crawford with murder, carjacking, kidnapping and sexually assaulting the carjacking victim.

Now Rosa's mother is said to have turned down the city's $110,000 reward for the carjacker's capture - saying she did not want to have anything to do with the money.

As her teenage son was held in prison on suicide watch, Philadelphia Police's Homicide Capt James Clark and Rosa's attorney confirmed her decision to NBC10. 

A member of the Philadelphia Police press team told MailOnline: 'They're not in a position yet to give the reward to anyone - this case is only a week old.

'But I've heard the rumours that that was the case, that the mother was offered the money and turned it down.'

The decision over who should earn the reward now rests with the Mayor's office. 

The crash on Friday, which also left the victims' mother Keisha Williams, 34, in a critical condition, has shocked the city of Philadelphia.

Memorial: Heartsick neighbors pay their respects on Monday at a makeshift memorial for the three children in the spot where they were mowed down by carjackers while selling fruit at a church fundraiser

Senseless: The memorial for the children continued to grow through the weekend and into Monday

Earlier this week Philadelphia 76ers basketball legend Charles Barkley confirmed he would cover funeral costs for the three siblings. 

The trio were selling fruit at a church fundraiser when Crawford and Rosa allegedly lost control of the car they had stolen. 

Police said Rosa and Crawford forced a woman into her sport utility vehicle on Friday.

Defense lawyer Christopher Warren, though, said Rosa got in the vehicle after Crawford carjacked it. He said Rosa will regret that decision the rest of his life but is now cooperating with police.

Rosa and Crawford had been hanging out together for a few days when Crawford noticed a woman coming down the street and decided to carjack her, Warren said.

Police said the woman was then forced at gunpoint into the back seat.

The pair allegedy drove for about a mile before a tyre burst on the car, making them lose control at high speed with devastating consequences.

Anger: Neighbors jeered as one of the suspects was taken into custody by U.S. Marshals on Sunday

Witnesses reported seeing a car speeding through an intersection, then children lying motionless on the ground.

'We
 now have three children who are gone, and their mother is fighting for 
her life,' Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Everett Gillison told a news 
conference.

'This is a tragedy for our city'.

Rosa's attorney said he 'can't get the image of the girl flying over the hood of the SUV out of his mind.'

Mr Warren said that after talking with his mother and pastor, Rosa turned himself in.

'He
 and his mother sat down and decided the best thing they can do is try 
and cooperate to atone for what happened,' he told TV stations.

He said Rosa had never been arrested before and had planned to join the Marines in two months.

The carjacked woman, who was sexually assaulted, and a friend helping the family sell fruit were also injured in the accident. 

Bounty: Police initially offered a $60,000 reward for the arrest of the carjacking suspects, which later rose

Damage: Police examine the wreckage of the stolen SUV, which is believed blew a tyre and ran off the road
