Sought-after Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin has pledged his short-term future to the club, though he says he will re-evaluate his future in the summer.

The French international has been linked with a switch to Arsenal, who are in the market for a defensive midfielder this winter, as well as with a reunion with Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham.

But Schneiderlin believes he will finish the season with the high-flying Saints as it is 'always difficult to leave in January'.

'It's always difficult to leave in January,' he told Telefoot

'I think I'll finish the season at Southampton and we'll see what will happen next. I don't set my mind on these things anymore.

'What should happen will happen. Since this summer, I learned that you should never think that you're gone before you actually did.'

The 25-year-old actively pursued a career away from St Mary's last summer amid plenty of departures on the South Coast, before Southampton blocked any potential move away.

Arsene Wenger is a keen admirer of the midfielder who has since redeemed himself to his fans and Arsenal were thought to be leading the chase.

But it now appears the Gunners, and any other Premier League side, will have to wait until at least the summer.
