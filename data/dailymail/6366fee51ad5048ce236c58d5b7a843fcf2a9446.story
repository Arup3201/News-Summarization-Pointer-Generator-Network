Amanda Knox is due to find out today whether she faces a retrial for the murder of British student Meredith Kercher.

Italian supreme court judges are expected to decide if ‘Foxy Knoxy’ and her ex-boyfriend Raffaele  Sollecito should be retried – or whether their acquittal in 2011 should be confirmed.

Meredith, 21, from Coulsdon, Surrey, was found semi-naked with her throat cut in the bedroom of the house she shared with Knox and two other women in the hilltop town of Perugia in November 2007.

Final hurtle: Amanda Knox, seen here in 2009, faces one last judgement day tomorrow when the Italian Supreme Court considers whether the appeal that freed her should be upheld

Yesterday Meredith’s sister Stephanie
 said: ‘There are lots of questions without answers and that’s why we 
are looking for the truth.

‘We miss Meredith terribly and nothing will bring her back.

‘We hope that the supreme court hearing will help to find some answers to what happened that night.

‘We still get messages of support from all over the world.  Meredith will never be forgotten but it’s also important not to forget 
what happened, a beautiful young girl, my little sister, taken away from
 us too early in a brutal manner, with many aspects to still clarify.’

Knox, 25, and Sollecito, 29 tomorrow,
 are said to be anxiously awaiting the outcome of the hearing in Rome. 
The case will be decided purely on paperwork and legal documents with no
 new witness evidence and neither Knox nor Sollecito will be in court.

Since returning to Seattle after 
serving four years of her sentence, Knox has written a book about her 
imprisonment and is due to give an interview to American TV station ABC 
next month ahead of its release.

Judgement day: Knox, 25, and her former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were acquitted and freed in 2011, though they could face trial again if the Supreme Court rules there is enough evidence

Judges will rule whether their are 
grounds for a new trial or if the case against them should uphold the 
appeal verdict of October 2011 which cleared them of the murder after 
they had initially been found guilty in 2009, with Knox getting 26 years
 and Sollecito, 25 years in jail.

The
 case made headlines around the world amid tales of sex games and drugs 
and there were traumatic scenes when they were convicted initially and 
when they were cleared after a fresh hearing heard how the police 
investigation had been bungled and was riddled with flaws.

Defence
 lawyers and experts acting for the pair revealed how evidence had been 
contaminated or poorly handled by forensic teams and that the conviction
 should be considered unsafe.

They were immediately freed with Knox returning to her home in Seattle while Sollecito went back to Bisceglie on the southern Italian coast near Bari.

Under Italian law there are three tiers of the judicial system and Monday's hearing in Rome will be behind closed doors with neither of them in attendance, with only their lawyers representing them.

A panel of judges will rule whether the Italian legal code was applied correctly and fairly in both trials and if they find grounds they can order a retrial - as prosecutors in Perugia have demanded - or they can close the case completely.

Images of Knox and Sollecito embracing after Kercher was murdered made the trial even more sensational

The case will be decided purely on 
paperwork and legal documents with no new witnesses giving evidence and 
neither of them will be in court.

Luciano
 Ghirga, Knox's lawyer, said: 'She is very anxious about the hearing but
 she is waiting for it knowing full well that the outcome is very 
important.'

Sollecito has also written a book and has already given an interview on Italian TV about the case where he said he and Knox were no longer lovers but they were still in touch. He visited her earlier this year and they speak on Skype regularly.

He is now studying in Verona and they have always insisted they are innocent of Leeds University student Meredith's murder. She had only been in Italy for two months before she was killed having arrived from Coulsdon for a year long course as part of her degree.

His father Francesco said: 'He is working hard on his studies. He's working on a project involving the movement of surgical instruments during operations. He is calm and serene even if we are all in a state of apprehension.'

During the investigation and trial, much was made of Knox's character, with prosecutors saying she was highly sexual and had manipulated Sollecito but her lawyers dismissed the theory.

Drifter Rudy Guede is serving 16 years for the murder having initially being sentenced to 30 but this was later reduced on appeal.
