Heartbreaking: The usually gregarious Morgan was quiet and appeared weak as he slowly moved with his walker

Now, his attorney has revealed Morgan is still struggling to simply return 'to the way he was' after this trauma.

On Wednesday, Morgan appeared a far cry from the extroverted and gregarious characters he has played on film and television, and was barely audible as he spoke to a nearby photographer.

At one point as he returned to his car from the post office, the actor even had to briefly stop and catch his breath before moving on. 

In addition to his fiancee he was also accompanied by an aide who was there to help him get into the car.

Fighting: Morgan revealed he is still 'fighting every day' to recover following the crash that claimed the life of his friend, James McNair

Injuries: In addition to broken bones and ribs, the actor also suffered a traumatic brain injury

Morgan was critically injured in early June when a Wal-Mart tractor-trailer rammed into a limousine bus he and his friends were travelling in on the New Jersey Turnpike.

The comedian, known for his roles on Saturday Night Live and 30 Rock, was returning home to New York City from a show at a Delaware casino. 

He spent almost two months in the hospital and rehab following the accident before he could return home, and the extent of his brain injury is still unknown.

'He's fighting to get better, and if there's a chance for him to be back to the Tracy Morgan he once was, he's going to try to do that,' said his lawyer Benedict Morelli last month. 

'But we just don't know because of the severity of the injuries that he sustained and the fact that he had such a severe brain injury.'

The actor did appear much better than the last time he was spotted back in October being pushed in a wheelchair.

The driver of the tractor-trailer, Kevin Roper, was charged with death by auto and four counts of assault by auto in a New Jersey state court.

Earlier this week, Morgan and his attorneys accused Wal-Mart of stalling in a federal lawsuit that have brought against the company over their safety practices after it was reported that Roper was asleep at the wheel at the time of the crash.

Following the incident, Roper took to Twitter to deny claims he was under the influence at the time of the accident, saying; 'I was never charged at the scene of the accident because once again i was not guilty of any crime. Not until all the TV cameras came.'

The Georgia resident also stated that he felt 'horrible' and 'wished it was him who was hurt' before writing; 'So yes i am now most likely f****d because i had an unfortunate ACCIDENT with the wrong car that night.'

Morgan was forced to put an FX series he had in development on hold after the accident, though his new film with Chris Rock, Take Five, will be released this month. 

He came out against Wal_mart in a public statement this past September after they accused him of being at fault during the accident for not wearing a seatbelt.

'I can't believe Walmart is blaming me for an accident they caused,' he said at the time. 

'I'm fighting hard every day to get back.'
