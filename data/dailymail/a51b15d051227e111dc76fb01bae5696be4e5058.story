A payout of £4,500 to Milly Dowler’s killer provoked outrage among MPs and campaigners last night.

Levi Bellfield was granted compensation for a prison attack when a fellow inmate attempted to blind him. He suffered only minor cuts to his face.

He sued the Government for failing to protect him at high-security Wakefield Prison and won a three-year legal battle after the Ministry of Justice admitted full liability at a county court hearing.

It is understood that the long dispute, as civil servants tried to contest his claim, has run up a substantial legal bill which will be met by taxpayers.

Bellfield has told friends he will spend the money renting a caravan in Kent for his elderly mother.

Last night Labour MP Ian Austin condemned the payout as ‘disgusting’ and promised to raise it with Justice Secretary Chris Grayling.

He said: ‘This is a complete and utter disgrace. I will be asking Mr Grayling how this evil child murderer could possibly be awarded such a huge sum of money. Every right-thinking person will agree this is distasteful and wrong.’

National Victims’ Association founder David Hines added: ‘It really gets us that murderers claim for being attacked and get rewards. It’s a sin.’

Bellfield was told in 2011 that he would die behind bars for the murder of the 13-year-old in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, nine years earlier.

He was already serving a whole life term handed down in 2008 for the murders of Amelie Delagrange, 22, and 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell.

Bellfield lured Milly back to his flat before killing her and dumping her body in remote woodland in Hampshire where he used to walk his dog. The teenager’s skeletal remains were found six months later.

A series of police blunders left Bellfield free to stalk and kill two more victims and attempt to kill a third. The compensation is likely to enrage the Dowler family, who were forced to relive their ordeal during the Old Bailey trial.

Speaking after Bellfield’s conviction, her mother Sally said she hoped the killer would receive the ‘same brutality’ in prison that he used against his victims.

‘The length to which the system goes to protect his human rights seems so unfair compared to what we as a family have had to endure,’ she added.

The attack took place when an inmate with a makeshift weapon tried to stab Bellfield in the eye at the West Yorkshire prison in 2009.

The burly former bouncer and wheel clamper only suffered a minor scrape but claimed prison guards should have protected him.

Ministry of Justice lawyers spent three years trying to stop Bellfield receiving any taxpayer-funded compensation. But earlier this week he was awarded the cash at Durham County Court after they were forced to admit full liability.

A source close to Bellfield’s family said: ‘Levi will transfer the funds to relatives. He wants them to use it on the caravan.

‘He’s angry that prison guards let him in that part of the prison. He says by putting him in that wing, it was just asking for an attack to happen. Another inmate waited for him outside one of the bathrooms. The inmate went for his eye but missed. It was pretty tame.’

A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: ‘We are hugely disappointed that Levi Bellfield was awarded £4,500 by a judge following an assault by a prisoner in 2009 at HMP Wakefield.’
