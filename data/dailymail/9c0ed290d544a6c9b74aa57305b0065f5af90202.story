They have been at the heart of Manchester United's recent return to form but England defensive duo Phil Jones and Chris Smalling could soon be on their way out of Old Trafford.

Both men will see their contracts with the club expire at the end of next season and Sportsmail understands that talks on new deals are yet to be opened with either.

United are thought to be relaxed about the situation but will be reluctant to lose the pair for nothing.

Phil Jones celebrates Manchester United's victory over Liverpool - but could be heading for the exit door

Both Jones and Smalling have seen their Manchester United careers hampered by injuries 

The lack of activity on their behalf may come as a surprise given recent form.

Jones, 23, and Smalling, 25, formed a resolute centre-back pairing in United's 3-0 home victory over Tottenham and 2-1 defeat of Liverpool at Anfield - regarded as the club's best performances under Louis van Gaal.

Their confident outings alongside each other have reignited long-held hopes that they could form a long-term partnership at the heart of United's defence for years to come.

But it would appear the club is in no rush to tie up their futures. 

The pair are two of a number of high-profile players whose contracts expire at the same time including goalkeeper David de Gea, converted wingback Ashley Young and striker Robin van Persie. 

Both Jones and Smalling were billed as being the centre back pairing for club and country for years to come

Chris Smalling has attracted interest from Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger 

Smalling, who cost United £10m when he signed from Fulham in 2010, is a long-term target of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger.

The Frenchman tried to sign the Greenwich-born centre-half when he left Craven Cottage and repeated his attempts last summer.

Should United be willing to listen to offers this summer Smalling may well find himself heading back to the capital.

Jones, for whom United paid Blackburn Rovers £17m in 2011, was hailed as a future great by Sir Alex Ferguson who added that he could become one of the best players in the club's history.

Smalling is part of the England team preparing to face Lithuania and Italy 

Jones is also part of the England squad for the international double header 

Like Smalling, his cause has not been helped by injuries and inconsistency.

The pair have started five games together for United as a centre-half combination and the club have won all five matches, conceding just two goals.

United have been extensively linked with Dortmund defender Mats Hummels, however Sportsmail understands some at the club harbour concerns over the Germany international's apparent lack of pace.

Hummels, 26, is likely to cost around £36m however, Van Gaal has been promised significant funds to again strengthen his squad.

United are also trailing Athletic Bilbao defender Aymeric Laporte.

The 20-year-old Frenchman fits the bill, although the Basque club will demand a release fee of £30m.
