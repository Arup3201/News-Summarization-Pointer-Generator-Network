An inspirational seven-year-old has overcome having both of her legs amputated by learning to skateboard and has even mastered skating tricks.

Rosie Davies was born with Spinal Segmental Dysgenesis (SSD), a life-threatening spinal condition, which meant her legs had been stuck in a cross-legged position.

The rare condition meant that her vital organs, including her kidneys, were being slowly crushed and that a double amputation was her only option.

Rosie was born with Spinal Segemental Dygenesis, which meant she had to have both of her legs amputated 

Rosie, of Walsall in the West Midlands, underwent pioneering surgery lasting 13 hours two years ago, which resulted in both of her legs being removed.

But despite the operation, which took place at the Royal Orthopedic Hospital in Birmingham, the seven-year-old has learned to skateboard, mastering tricks.

Proud mother Mandy Collett said: 'Since the surgery, Rosie has changed dramatically.

'She can now stand up on her skateboard, pushing herself along, and even does tricks.

During the surgery both of her legs were removed and a section of bone was then used to help bridge the gap in her spine 

'I called her my little Buddha because of the way her legs were.

'When she was born I was told she would be stick on a bean bag all her life, but she has proved everyone wrong.'

Spinal Segemental Dysgenesis is a rare developmental malformation, which occurs duirng pregnancy or at birth.

It causes a malformation in the spinal cord and can be discovered during pre-natal screening.

Babies who are born with the condition like Rosie usually have a gap in their backbone, causing mobility problems.

In Rosie's case the gap in her spine meant her legs were contorted up against her stomach and she was running out of space in her chest.

Without the surgery, her internal organs would have been crushed which could have proved fatal.

After being diagnosed with SSD, doctors discovered that five of the bones that make up part of the spine were missing, causing a 10cm gap in her backbone.

During the operation, which has only been carried out on three people worldwide, Rosie's legs were amputated below the knee.

A section of bone was then taken to bridge the gap in her spine and two metal rods were then bolted to the upper spine and the hips to provide extra support.

Ms Collett, 47, added: 'The doctors are really pleased with Rosie's progress.

'They were worried her back wouldn't be strong enough, but it is better than it was before.

'At the moment they don't think her hips would be strong enough for her to have prosthetic limbs.

'But she doesn't let anything stop her and her amazing upper body strength has come from her doing the things she wants to do with her skateboard.

'She's taught herself to walk on her hands and do cartwheels.'

On top of her skateboarding, active Rosie is keen on football and volleyball, and her family is hoping to raise £1000 for a specialised bike.

Her mother explained: 'What she really wants now is a bike for Christmas, but it has to be specially made for her.

When Rosie was born, her condition meant that her legs were stuck in the crossed-leg position 

Her mother Mandy says that due to the way her legs were, she nicknamed her 'My little Buddha' 

'It would be one where she can use her hands to peddle, something like the Paralympians use.'

Spine surgeon, David Marks, who performed the operation, said: "Because of her rare condition, Rosie was only the third person in the world to have this type of operation and we are so pleased with how well she's doing.

"Rosie's always been a very cheerful and positive little girl and I know she has a bright and happy future ahead."
