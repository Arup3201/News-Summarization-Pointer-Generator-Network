A struggling mother-of-three, who is battling terminal cancer, and her blind husband have received $1 million of donations after appealing to the Australian public for financial aid.

The couple who first appeared on A Current Affair last month, have thanked the generous donors who have brought some joy into the lives of the Piper family. 

Alex Piper's husband suddenly became blind in both eyes 16 years ago and the mother-of-three did not hesitate to take on the role of the family breadwinner. 

Then, four years ago when the now 41-year-old was diagnosed with breast cancer, Alex maintained her job throughout months of radiotherapy and chemotherapy while barely uttering a murmur of complaint.

After being diagnosed with stage four stomach cancer and dropping down to a mere 41 kilograms, the Piper family from NSW called out for help by taking their story of struggle and survival to the public.

Matt and Alex Piper have shared their story with the public in an effort to raise money for their family

The family of five have been struggling financially since Matt became blind 16 years ago, forcing Alex to take on the role as the sole breadwinner of the family 

'It doesn't even feel real, it's like a dream,' Ms Piper told A Current Affair on Monday.

'It's nice to think I've got something to look forward to, some joy, instead of being in pain and not feeling well. I have something else to focus on.'

'We are just so appreciative of everything, the generosity and the money that is there to further Alex's future in life and hope it's going to be worthwhile,' Mr Piper said. 

Alex and her husband Matt first met as teenagers before they finally began dating at 21 years of age. 

Only two years after the duo married, things took a turn for the worse when Matt lost his eyesight and was declared legally blind.

Further damage to the nerves in his hands and arms rendered him unable to pursue a career as a masseuse, but the father of three - Charley, 13, Honey, 10, and Willow, 5 - admits the hardest thing about his condition is having never seen his children.

'It hurt hard. My heart was broken for a very long time,' Matt told A Current Affair last month.

'To overcome that - I feel and touch now. I've been blind for 16 years now.'

'I saw Alex walking down the aisle and that picture I still have a strong image of in my mind.'

Alex was forced to provide for her family solely on her own, but things took a turn for the worst when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in late 2010.

Despite the emotional and physical demands of the disease, the 41-year-old continued to go to work each day, even after the cancer was found to have spread to her bones and stomach a year later.

'I only had two weeks off work. I did radiation and chemotherapy and I worked the whole way through and I wish I'd taken time for myself,' Alex said.

'It hurt hard. My heart was broken for a very long time,' Matt told A Current Affair 

She was finally forced to leave her career behind three weeks ago, but despite being drained of all energy and appetite and being told by doctors that there is no cure for her illness, Alex still holds hope.

'The doctors have their views on what's possible and what's not possible, but I like to have my own views,' she said.

So far, more than $1,002 has been donated to help the Piper family after Alex's aunt, Amanda Fraser, took to MyCause.com to share her niece's story.

'The strain is starting to show, hence our call to arms with this campaign, as we've finally convinced Alex to let us try and assist,' Ms Fraser wrote.

'She is a fighter, she is positive… but Alex can no longer cope with the struggles of bringing up a young family and loss of income. 

'The much needed funding that we raise, will be utilised to both ease the financial burden on the family, help to cover the mortgage and allow us to continue to try and find the best and most innovative treatments possible.'

Before: Alex, who was diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago, was forced to leave her job three weeks ago fo further treatment after the cancer was found to have spread to her stomach and bones

After: She now weighs only 41 kilograms and, despite being drained of all energy and appetite and being told by doctors that there is no cure for her illness, still holds hope
