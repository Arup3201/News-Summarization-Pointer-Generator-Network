Ironic arrest: Donald Blood III, 55, told police he mistook the 'Wilson House's' front lawn for a parking lot when he drove on to the grassy patch a little after 7:30 p.m. Christmas Eve

At least, he won't have to go far for help.

A New England man faces a drunken driving rap after an unfortunate -  but undeniably ironic - incident in which he parked on the lawn of Bill Wilson's childhood Vermont home on Christmas Eve.

Time Magazine once honored Wilson as one of the 100 most-important people of the 20th century for co-founding Alcoholics Anonymous, or AA.

'The Wilson House,' as Wilson's childhood home in East Dorset, Vermont, is called, now serves as a 'sanctuary' for recovering alcoholics and still reportedly hosts numerous AA meetings each week, according to the Wilson House website. 

Donald Blood III, 55, of Marlboro, Mass., told police he mistook the 'Wilson House's' lawn for a parking lot when he drove on to the patch a little after 7:30 p.m. Monday evening, Vermont State Police said.

Built in 1852, the 14-room country hotel was renovated in 1987 and added in 1995 to the National Register of Historic Places. The hotel is reportedly the largest building in East Dorset, Vermont.

The 'Wilson House' once served as Wilson's parents' home and business, the Mount Aeolus Inn and Tavern.

Visionary: Bill W., or Bill Wilson, is buried - along with his his wife - a short distance from his one-time home that Blood mistook for a parking lot

But now reportedly acts as 'a living memorial to Bill W., as well as a place of sanctuary where people can come to give thanks to God for their new lives,' as the home's website says.

Calls placed to the home Thursday went unanswered, although a recorded message revealed AA meetings occurred there as recently as Christmas Day, or the morning after Blood was cited for drunken driving.

However, it's not clear whether a meeting was taking place at the time Blood parked his car on the home's lawn.

Blood III was reportedly ordered to appear in court in Bennington on Jan. 14 for the unfortunate misadventure.

The 'Wilson House' is located about a mile from the cemetery where Bill Wilson and his wife, Lois, are interred.
