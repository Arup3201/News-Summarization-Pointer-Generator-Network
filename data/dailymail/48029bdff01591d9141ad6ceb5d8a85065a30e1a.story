The founder of whistle blowing website WikiLeaks has launched his political party to contest Australian elections this year.

Julian Assange, 41, said the WikiLeaks party would field seven candidates in Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia states.

The Australian citizen is one of three party candidates who will run for upper house Senate seats in Victoria that will be held before December.

Mr Assange spoke to his party in Melbourne via Skype from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he 
has taken asylum from extradition to Sweden to face questioning over 
sexual offense allegations.

The WikiLeaks party was registered by the Australian Electoral Commission this month.

Mr Assange said his party's seven Senate 
candidates would go to the national capital of Canberra to address what 
it says has been a gradual decline in Australian democracy over the past
30 years. 

'Canberra needs to be a place of light, not a place of darkness,' he told his party members.

If the 41-year-old wins the election, he would be required to take up his Senate seat on July 1, 2014.

WikiLeaks Party national council member 
Sam Castro said that if Assange wins a seat but cannot return to 
Australia by then, the party can choose a replacement.

But she said the onus is on the 
Australian government to ensure an elected senator could sit in 
Parliament. The situation would be unprecedented, she said. 

'What would that mean if the 
Australian government did nothing to assure the safe passage of an 
elected representative who has been granted asylum?

The 41-year-old has spent more than a year in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he has avoided extradition to Sweden for questioning over sexual assault allegations

'Whether the current government or the 
opposition would go against the United States' wishes, I guess, is 
something we could find out in time'.

The whistle-blower took asylum at the embassy more 
than a year ago rather than comply with a British order that he go to 
Sweden for questioning about sex crime allegations. 

He says extradition to the Scandinavian 
country is merely a first step in efforts to move him to the United 
States, where he has infuriated officials by publishing secret 
documents, including 250,000 State Department cables.

Assange says his party will fight to keep politicians like Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd (pictured) honest. He told his party: 'Canberra needs to be a place of light, not a place of darkness'

U.S. Army soldier 
Bradley Manning has admitted passing those documents to WikiLeaks. 

The Australian government has echoed 
U.S. condemnations of Assange's publishing, but has also acknowledged he
has broken no Australian law.

Assange told Australia's The 
Conversation website in February that he regards his bid to become a 
senator as a defense against potential criminal prosecution. 

Assange told the website that if he wins
a Senate seat, the U.S. Department of Justice would drop its espionage 
investigation rather than risk a diplomatic row.
