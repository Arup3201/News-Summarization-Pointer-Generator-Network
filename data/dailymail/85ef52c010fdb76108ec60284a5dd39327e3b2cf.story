Laura Robson won a battle with her nerves yesterday to complete a sensational victory over the No 10 seed in her opening match at Wimbledon.

The 19-year-old punched the air after defeating Russian Maria Kirilenko in straight sets to become the only British woman into the second round.

As she left Court No 1 she fist-bumped her brother, Nick, 21, who works as a ground coverer on Court 18 but was allowed time off to sit courtside to see her play.

Afterwards she revealed that her mother Kathy, who had stayed home to look after the family’s two black labradors, had sent her eight text messages during her match.

But she is not allowed her mobile phone on court, so couldn’t read them until later.

Closing in on victory, Miss Robson became visibly anxious as she repeatedly misjudged her ball toss as she prepared to serve.

‘It was a big win for me,’ she said. ‘I think it was good that I managed to tough it out after I got so nervous. I go out against the top players with nothing to lose.’

Of her mother, who was at home in Putney, south-west London, Miss Robson said with a smile: ‘She always texts me back during matches, so when I get off the court I’ve got eight messages to read, generally about catching the ball toss. She’s obviously pretty excited.’

Miss Robson said the rest of her family, including her oil company executive father Andrew, were there to see her and were ‘happy’.

Brother Nick, a chemistry student at 
Durham University, has had a summer job at Wimbledon since she played in
the tournament as a junior.

Miss Robson said: ‘They’re nice enough to let him off for a couple of hours when I’m playing. But it’s a bit weird seeing him in his outfit sitting on the side of the court rather than up in the box.’

Prime Minister David Cameron congratulated the teenager, saying on Twitter: 'Great to hear Laura Robson beat the number 10 seed Maria Kirilenko at Wimbledon.'

Her victory was a bright spark in another bleak day for British women as both Heather Watson and wildcard Tara Moore crashed out.

Miss Watson, who last year reached the third round, said she was still recovering from glandular fever after losing to American teenager Madison Keys.

Miss Moore, ranked 194 in the world, had earlier hit back at critics of the wildcard system that allows players picked by the Lawn Tennis Association into the first round  – and a guaranteed £23,500 even if they lose – without having to qualify.

Miss Moore wrote on Twitter: ‘Try one week in our shoes and you’d see the effort we put into training and not just for the Wimbledon two weeks you guys seem to see.’

She put up a battling performance against Estonia’s Kaia Kanepi, losing in three sets. Her defeat leaves just Miss Robson and Andy Murray flying the flag for Britain in the singles.
