Prime Minister Tony Abbott has thanked Australian defence personnel and others who served in Afghanistan.

In an address at the welcome home ceremony in Canberra, the prime minister said Afghanistan was a better place for the service of about 35,000 Australians.

He said the war in Afghanistan had ended not with victory or with defeat, but with hope for a better Afghanistan and a safer world.

Australia's involvement in Afghanistan, called Operation Slipper, spanned 13 years, from October 2001 to the end of 2014. 

During Australia's longest war, 41 personnel died, 262 were seriously wounded and hundreds of others suffered unseen wounds.

Mr Abbott said in a past war, Vietnam, those who served were not always properly recognised, but it would not be like that for those who served in Afghanistan.

'We are grateful to have you home, we acknowledge your achievements, and we thank you for your service,' he told the large gathering at the Australian War Memorial.

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said he saluted those who had served in Afghanistan who had brought new honour to the Anzac tradition.

More than 2000 soldiers, sailors and airmen plus members of government agencies and veterans marched past the Australian War Memorial.

Defence head Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin said Australian personnel had given new hope to the people of Afghanistan.

'We can never repay the debt of those who served,' he said.
