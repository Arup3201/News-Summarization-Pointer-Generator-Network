As huge blasts lit up the sky above the stricken warship you could be forgiven for thinking you were watching a scene from a Second World War naval battle.

But thankfully no shots were fired in anger when this former Portuguese Navy corvette was sunk by a team of engineers off the coast of the Algarve.

The Oliveira e Carmo, is one of four former warships that will serve as an artificial reef and diving site to attract more visitors to the area as part of the Ocean Revival Project.

Scroll down for video:

Doomed: The former Portuguese Navy corvette 'Oliveira e Carmo,' floats three miles off the coast of the Algarve as explosives experts prepare to detonate it

Blast: Explosions rip through the ageing vessel during the detonation. It is one of four ships being sunk in the area to provide diving sites and artificial reefs

Professional: Four 'cutting explosives,' imported from the United States, were placed inside the old ship as part of its carefully planned sinking

A team of specialists had filled the 86m long vessel with 'cutting' explosives which would send it safely to the bottom of the sea about three miles off of Alvor, in the southern Algarve.

The equipment was imported 
from the US and put in place by a team from
Canadian Artificial Reef (CAR) Consulting, who specialise in this type of work.

The group has previously sunk ships as artificial reefs in other parts of the world, including off the coast of Spain, New Zealand and Australia. The vessel had been carefully filled with 220 tons of concrete before it was sunk to ensure it came to rest in the correct position.

Sinking ships for use as diving sites is a skilled process aimed at making them as safe as possible for use by people and for the marine environment. Ships are purged of oils, hydraulic fluids, and other dangerous chemicals and much of their superstructure is removed.

The inside of ships are normally gutted of all parts that corrode quickly, and would be dangerous to divers if they came loose. Some parts can be sold for scrap including materials such as copper wiring.

Sinking feeling: Smoke billows from the ship's funnel as it begins to take on water following the blast

Final moments: Much of the Oliveira e Carmo has been submerged as technicians look on at close quarters. The ship's sinking was a carefully planned operation

The end: The ship's bow can be seen sticking out of the water as it begins to disappear. The corvette was filled with 220 tons of concrete before it was sunk to ensure it came to rest in the right position
