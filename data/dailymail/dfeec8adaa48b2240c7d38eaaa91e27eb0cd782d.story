A Scottish mansion has sold for £4million in what is thought to have been the biggest sale north of the border since the financial crash.

With nine bedrooms, a cinema room, gym and seven-acre garden, Hillwood House has been trumpeted as a sign of Scotland's recovery, though it still costs the same as a three-bed flat in London's South Kensington.

The house with its own mock-turret on the slopes of Corstorphine Hill, Edinburgh, was once home to the MacKinnon family, who owned the rights to Drambuie for a century before selling the alcohol brand in September.

Plush: Hillwood House in Edinburgh has sold for £4million, making it what is believed to be Scotland's biggest post-crash property sale

Lavish: The kitchen of the luxury home, which was built in the late 1800s and housed the family behind the Drambuie alcohol brand

Room with a view: Property analysts say Scotland's market is creeping up to the level it attained in 2007, but it is not there yet

Big: But the nine-bedroom mansion still costs less than a three-bedroom apartment in London's district of South Kensington

The sprawling home has sold for almost £1million more than Scotland's previous post-crash record holder, a mansion in one of Aberdeen's most exclusive streets which fetched £3million last year.

And its  price is close to that fetched by Scotland's most expensive home ever sold - Seton Castle in Longniddry, East Lothian, which dotcom millionaires Stephen Leach and Heather Luscombe bought for £5million just before the crash in 2007.

Built in 1872 a few miles from the city centre, Hillwood House was restored before going on sale last year and includes period features and a private tennis court. 

It is perhaps best-known for its links to Scottish industry, having been home to the MacKinnon family which owned the Drambuie blend of whisky, honey, herbs and spices for more than 100 years.

Legend claimed Bonnie Prince Charlie handed the recipe to a Captain John MacKinnon (no relation) for helping him escape to the Isle of Skye after defeat at the Battle of Culloden in 1746.

Living room: Sales of £1million-plus homes in Scotland are on the rise, with 146 properties fetching seven figures last year

It was then reportedly passed to hotel owner John Ross in 1873, after which he began serving it to his guests on the Isle of Skye. The name is said to have come from the Gaelic 'an dram buidheach', meaning 'the drink that satisfies'.

In the early 20th Century the recipe's rights were sold to Malcolm MacKinnon, no relation to the Captain who originally obtained it.

With a few cases of the drink bottled in Edinburgh, he founded an empire which has now made Drambuie one of Britain's most popular spirits.

Hillwood House was still the Scottish base of Drambuie until around a decade ago, but the brand was sold by the MacKinnon family in September last year to the makers of rival spirit Glenfiddich.

Sales of £1million-plus homes in Scotland are on the rise, and yesterday it emerged 146 properties fetched seven figures last year - up from 137 in 2013. 

Bathroom: The grand house's facilities have the feel of a hotel sauna - useful for relaxing after a match on its private tennis court 

Cinema room: The house has the sort of facilities which would normally be reserved for the 'iceberg basements' of the mega-rich

Keeping fit: The house's private gym. One estate agent claimed. 'Confidence has returned. People (buyers) act by following each other'

Alan Fraser, of the Edinburgh-based Investment Property Agency, claimed sales such as Hillwood House will become more prevalent over the next few years.

'Confidence has returned,' he said. 'People act by following each other. After seven years of property recession people are realising they need to get on with their lives.'

Blair Stewart, a partner at Strutt & Parker, which sold the house, declined to comment on the sale or confirm the price.

But he said 66 sales in excess of £1million were recorded in Edinburgh last year.  

'2014's figures were slightly up on the previous three years but still only represents 52 per cent of the total sales at the peak of the market in 2007,' he added. 'Transactions in this sector are still a long way off the boom years of 2007/2008.'

Eat in style: Despite its modern interiors, there are some rooms in the now-sold house which have been kept to a period effect

Gardens: The house is on the side of Corstorphine Hill, Edinburgh, and is a few miles from the city centre

Competition: Its price is close to that fetched by Scotland's most expensive home ever - Seton Castle in Longniddry, East Lothian (above)
