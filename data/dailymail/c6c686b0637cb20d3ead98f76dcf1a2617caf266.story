It is the epitome of genteel sophistication, but behind the scenes The Ritz hotel has been rocked by a scandal that could have its regulars spluttering into their high teas.

The managing director of the five-star London landmark has abruptly left his prestigious post after giving his secret girlfriend – a former Bulgarian reality TV contestant 22 years his junior – a coveted job as a resident singer.

Stephen Boxall, who had an enviable 19-year career at the hotel, did not disclose that he was in a relationship with 29-year-old Alexandra Anastas before giving her work in The Ritz’s elegant restaurant.

After this was discovered 51-year-old Mr Boxall tendered his resignation, the Mail on Sunday can reveal. 

Miss Anastas excitedly announced her appointment as the hotel’s Thursday night singer on social media four months ago – the month after she updated her Facebook page to say she was ‘in a relationship’ with an unknown partner.

Miss Anastas moved to Britain in 2013 with dreams of making it as a singer. She previously studied music in Sofia and took part in Star Academy, a Bulgarian music reality TV show, in 2005.

She and widower Mr Boxall are understood to have met at a London nightclub last year, and the couple spent the festive season together at his £1.1 million gated home in Oxshott, Surrey. On Christmas Day Miss Anastas posted online a picture of herself cuddling Mr Boxall’s son, with the message: ‘It’s been a fantastic year, I could not thank the Lord enough for everything… Feeling blessed and loved and HAPPY!’

Miss Anastas has enjoyed a life of high society since arriving in London, sitting in the Queen’s box at the Royal Albert Hall to watch Cirque du Soleil, seeing Cats at the London Palladium and going to the Royal Ballet. Online snaps show her dining on lobster, drinking champagne and preparing to fly business class to Zurich.

Mr Boxall worked his way up the ranks at The Ritz, becoming managing director in 2009. Last year, he said: ‘There is not another hotel that I would want to work in. Where do you go after The Ritz? I’ve got the best job in the world.’

The Ritz issued a statement confirming that Mr Boxall had tendered his resignation on Friday, which was accepted, and spoke of his role in maintaining the hotel’s reputation. However, a spokesman refused to comment further on any details, and would not confirm if Miss Anastas was still working as a singer.

But a source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘There were questions over her suitability for the job, considering her background. A reality TV star is not ordinarily what The Ritz would look for on a CV.’

Neither Mr Boxall nor Miss Anastas would comment yesterday.
