As lucky bounces go it’s right up there with the Dambusters – and only narrowly missed ending in catastrophe.

But this time it wasn’t the RAF dropping bouncing bombs on Germany, but the modern Luftwaffe inadvertently dropping one of its own transporter planes onto a busy main road, from where it bounced onto the runway, 30 yards away, as up to a thousand spectators watched in horror.

It was the plane’s last fight and one its pilot, Captain Jasmin Kirsch, is unlikely to forget – but for all the wrong reasons.

Close encounter: The Transall C-160 military plane approaches the Ballenstedt airfield in Saxony-Anhalt, central Germany, but lands on a side road before the runway

Families, children and plane-spotters 
had come to celebrate what was billed by the 
authorities as ‘the final flight’ for the 31-tonne Transall C-160 
military transporter plane.

The drama unfolded as the colossal plane - which was being de-commissioned by Germany’s armed 
forces - came in too low and landed about 100feet short of the 
runway on a main road built along a raised embankment.

The consequence of this was chillingly spectacular but potentially catastrophic.

As spectators lined the runway capturing head-on in film and video the moments of 
the plane’s final approach
 and landing into Ballenstedt airport in
Saxony-Anhalt in eastern Germany, its nose appeared to dip quite low.

Still filming: The spotters stand their ground as the plane approaches even though the pilot had reported that he could not see the start of the runway from his cockpit

But horror struck as six of 
the plane’s landing wheels thudded into the raised road embankment
 causing the plane to bounce back into the air, with its wings waggling 
momentarily to the right.

Some of the onlookers closest to the 
road were forced to duck and 
dive for cover just feet (and possibly inches) away from its 131-feet 
wings and propeller blades.

The Transall C-160 military 
transporter plane flew another 30 yards to the start of the runway where
 100 yards further on its pilot brought it to a safe stop.

Some witnesses said the fans were 
‘suicidally close’ to the runway and questioned how the police and 
authorities could have allowed that.

Photographs and video footage of the 
unfolding drama show spectators throwing
 themselves to the ground to avoid the roaring 15-feet
 four-bladed propellers.

Film footage posted online 
captures the comments of those witnessing the unplanned bounce, with one
 man amid the oohs, aaahs, and gasps summing up his surprise with a German swear word.

The pilot Captain Kirsch is reported 
in Germany’s ‘Bild’ newspaper saying: ’From the cockpit we couldn’t make
 out the start of the runway.’

Pensioner Herbert Dzienkowski, 62, who witnessed the incident said: ’After circling the airfield twice the aircraft came down.’

He described how the 44 year-old aircraft ‘ripped up’ the tarmac on the main road as it hopped with a bounce back into the air.

Even the police responsible for 
cordoning off the landing area appeared surprised as there only a few ineffective metal barriers and cones 
along the side of the road.

The military plane, which has clocked
 up 12,000 flying hours in its lifetime  is to spend its retirement as 
an exhibit at the Aviation Museum in  Wernigerode.

The museum's spokesman, 
Madeleine Aulich, said:’Thankfully no-one got hurt.’

But witnesses talking about the 
incident on the internet are concerned – particularly with cars parked 
up close along the road which bi-sects the airfield about 100feet short
 of the start of the runway.

One said:’There was nearly a catastrophe with fatalities.’

Another noted that it was ‘suicidal’
 for spectators to go – or even be allowed to go – so close pointing 
out: ’That’s a 5.5metre propeller blade in front of the wing.’

A third said: ’Be glad the 
undercarriage tyres held up on impact and there were no bits and pieces 
flying around people’s ears.’

One group in a specially cordoned off
 area for photographers seemed most at risk.

A piece of 
close-up footage shows the plane almost on top of the cameraman, who 
pans to see the silhouette of the flight crew in the cabin just as the aeroplane skims the people in front of him – including the 
back of one person.

One observer called Harry Klein noted: ’Whoever on the ground allowed spectators to go so close should be heavily fined.’

The Luftwaffe said they were investigating the issue of the raised road.

Wing commander Kai Gudenoge, 
spokesman for the Luftwaffe in Köln-Wahn, said: ‘The problem of the 
raised road does exist. Whether it is the only cause, I can’t say. We 
still feel the shock in our bones.’

He said the problem was not the 
plane but the insufficient barriers: ‘We had from the airport 
authorities the confirmation that streets should have been clear’.

The Transall C-160 which has a crew 
of three and can carry up to 93 troops was built by a French-German 
consortium Transporter Allianz and has been in service around the  world
 – including Afghanistan - since 1965 with the German, French and South 
African military with some 214 built until 1985.
