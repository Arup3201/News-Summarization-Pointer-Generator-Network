A 23-year-old woman who was believed 
to be drunk last year when she smashed her car through a fence and into a
 tree - killing two of her friends - pleaded no contest to vehicular 
manslaughter during a Friday court appearance.

Jeanette Romero was behind the wheel of the early morning November 3 
crash that claimed the lives of Blanca Belman Almanza, 23, and 
Anagraciela Cuadra, 22, between Los Angeles and Pasadena.

Two other passengers survived the crash, according to reports. The group was out celebrating Cuadra's birthday.

Police claimed Romero was intoxicated, veered into a chain-link fence and hit a tree head on in the 1.30 a.m. accident.

She
 was originally charged with DUI, but that count was dropped as part of a
 plea deal, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said..

Romero
 faced as much as 13 years behind bars, but will instead serve only two 
years and three months. Her sentencing hearing is set for January.

Both Cuadra and Almanza were pronounced dead at the scene of the horrific early morning crash, officials said at the time.

Three others, including Romero, had to be cut from the wreckage of their Nissan Sentra. They fortunately survived.

According to the Los Angeles Times, the women were out celebrating the birthday of Ana Cuadra.

Cuadra left behind a two-year-old son and a six-year-old daughter. She had began working as a dental hygienist shortly before her tragic death.

Marlena Cuadra, told KCBS at the time that her daughter and Almanza were best friends.

'I understand that God gave me her, he took her away. He will give me strength,' she said.

The 110 Freeway from Los Angeles to Pasadena is notoriously unsafe, with curvy, narrow lanes and short entrances and off-ramps.

The oldest freeway in California, it was built in 1940.
