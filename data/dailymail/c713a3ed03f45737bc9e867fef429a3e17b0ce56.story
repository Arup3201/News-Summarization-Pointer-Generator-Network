A conman, who showered his girlfriend with gifts using money stolen from her own account, was jailed yesterday.

Adam Lloyd-Harris told Janine Munroe that he was a wealthy music executive and bought her  flowers, gifts and trips.

But the 32-year-old was funding his pretence of a lavish lifestyle by stealing almost £18,000 from his trainee nurse girlfriend.

Adam Lloyd-Harris siphoned £18,000 from Janine Munroe's during their seven-month relationship

Ms Munroe said their relationship had been 'idyllic' but did not realise she had been paying for the gifts herself. 

He was jailed for 17 months yesterday but Ms Munroe, 35, said the sentence was a 'disgrace'.

She said: 'I am angry he will be free again to walk into the arms of his next victim.'

Lloyd-Harris, 32, 'constructed a fantasy world' when he met Ms Munroe, telling her he was a record executive for Sony when he was actually unemployed.

The pair were together for seven months until she became suspicious in September 2009 and asked him to leave her home.

It emerged he had accessed her debit and credit cards that she had left in the house and then hidden bank statements to try and cover his tracks.

But she discovered the bundle of mail addressed to her before they split up.

Prosecutor John Brennan told Newcastle Crown Court: '[Lloyd-Harris] told her he had a job at Sony.

'When she made contact with Sony they said he never worked there and told her she was not the only person to have been in touch about him.'

Lloyd-Harris used Ms Munroe's debit and credit cards to lavish her with presents and then hid her statements to try and cover his tracks before she eventually became suspicious

Lloyd-Harris was suffering from a depressive illness when he stole the money, the court was told

Yesterday, he was sentenced to 17 months in jail but due to time already served he could be out within weeks.

Ms Munroe, of Ryhope, near Sunderland, said: 'He is nothing but scum. I have lost four years of my life because of him. I am angry to think that he could soon be doing this to someone else, which you can guarantee he will.

'But at least, for me, this is now over and tomorrow I start a whole new chapter in my life.'

Lloyd-Harris, formerly of Peterlee, admitted theft and fraud charges in December 2011 after conning Janine of the money she was saving to go to university.

But he failed to turn up at court - and convinced police to release him twice - on the basis he was suffering from a kidney disease.

The court heard how Lloyd-Harris hid 
Janine’s bank statements when the couple lived together at her 
Sunderland home so she did not become suspicious.

He took her on holiday to Berlin where he splashed out on luxury gifts and treats.

Judge James Goss QC told Lloyd-Harris at Newcastle Crown Court that he had 'constructed a fantasy world'

Mr
Brennan told the court: 'All of this was paid for by the complainant 
Janine Munro, not that she was aware of this at the time.'

The court heard Lloyd-Harris kept up a pretence of being a high-flying, wealthy executive during the relationship.

Judge James Goss QC told him: 'You constructed a fantasy world to mask your failure to cope emotionally and maintain your reputation of affluence.

'You told lie after lie. You secreted her post in order to maintain the charade that was taking place.

'It was very manipulative behaviour.'

Jamie Adams, defending, said Lloyd-Harris was suffering from depressive illness as well as physical ailments at the time.

Mr Adams said Lloyd Harris did not spend the stolen cash entirely on himself.

He said: 'It was actually to keep the myth by way of a facade that he was in employment.'
