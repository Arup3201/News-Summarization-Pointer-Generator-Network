Yesterday I woke to an azure blue sky, the sun beaming down on my lovely North Devon farmhouse. It should have been the perfect beach day. We do, after all, live just five minutes from one of the country’s most impressive stretches of sand. 

Alternatively, I could have relaxed in my garden enjoying the view of the estuary, boats bobbing, and happy holidaymakers out on the water.

But no such luck. Because, with yet another stream of people arriving to stay, what I actually did was this: strip five beds; put three loads of laundry into the washing machine; scrub toilets; dry bedding on the line; re-make said beds (two of which are bunks, and absolutely back breaking to put fitted sheets on); dash to the supermarket to restock on food and wine; buy flowers for the spare bedroom; pick up dog poo from the garden; hoover and marinade meat for an evening barbecue.

Rural idyll: Shona at home in her rambling old farmhouse in Devon on a houseguest-free morning

You might wonder if I am running some sort of guesthouse establishment or, indeed, a small boutique hotel. Well, in many ways it feels as if I am. Welcome to chez Sibary. We are not in the AA guide and have no rosettes on the wall outside. But it appears we do have vacancies the entire summer and, yes, breakfast is always included.

I am, of course, talking about the dreaded holiday houseguest. They come in many guises but by far the worst, and most annoying, are the 'passers-by'. 

The phone call usually comes at some point in the morning. I had one just last week. It was a family from Surrey whom I vaguely knew through my son Monty’s old school. 'Hello! Remember us?' the mother trilled. Well, only just, I thought. She continued. 'You know, we met at that Christmas party last year. Our son, Archie, was in the year below?'

By now the penny is dropping. 'Well, the thing is,' she says, 'we’re just passing by on our way to Cornwall and thought we’d drop in and see how you’re coping with Devon life!'

An hour later, a car laden with surfboards and bicycles pulls up and said family of four spills out onto our driveway. 'Gosh,' the mother says, doing a quick assessment of how large our farmhouse is. 'We didn’t realise the journey would be so tiring.'

Before I have time to think 'What’s your name again?' they have hung up their Joules fleeces in the boot-room and are making noises about staying the night. They offer to pitch their tent in the garden and promise to be 'no trouble at all'.

But two days later they are still lingering, it’s pouring with rain outside and I can see that the thought of moving on from us to a campsite is looking less appealing by the minute.

Guests: For Shona Sibary, the joy has gone out of entertaining thanks to the stream of visitors since January

Stressful: Juggling the needs of guests with work and family life has taken its toll on Shona

I did, eventually, get rid of them. But only by claiming that my daughter, Dolly, had diarrohea — nothing like the threat of a bug to evacuate the property. 

Of course, I could have put my foot down earlier. Or simply said 'no'. And, probably, we only have ourselves to blame. 

Back in January when we decided to up sticks for a life by the coast, the 800-year old, Grade Two listed farmhouse we are now in felt like the last place anyone would visit.

Yes, we could see the sea from its remote, rural position at the top of a hill, but all the trees in the garden were horizontal from the wind, it was blowing a howling gale and I had to pick my way through numerous cowpats to get to the front door.

I remember turning to my husband, Keith, and saying: 'You do realise that if we move here nobody will want to come and see us.' Famous last words. Fast-forward six months, throw in a heatwave and it feels as if my entire address book has eaten me out of house and home. In the past three months alone we have had 17 sets of houseguests come to stay. It’s total madness.

For it’s a very different picture in August. The ice-cream van on the seafront has opened, the seagulls are no longer being flung past our bedroom window by a sixty-mile-an-hour wind and there is a definite feel of summer holiday in the air. 

Oh, to enjoy it. But this, it seems, is the preserve of the houseguest. My job, as hostess, is to run around in circles providing endless meals and being a one-woman tourist information centre on hand to help with everything from tide timetables to the best place for a spot of crabbing. 

The problem is that we not only live in a relatively sought after holiday destination (Westward Ho! is ten minutes in one direction, Croyde beach twenty minutes in the other) but we are also just off the A39 which, as any of you who have ever driven to the West Country will know, is the North Devon Link Road — rather aspirationally labelled The Atlantic Highway.

It is this stretch of road that every family from the Home Counties will, at some point, barrel down in order to reach the more salubrious parts of Cornwall like Padstow, Rock and the Camel Estuary.

Of course, with prices that way being so eye-wateringly high, it makes absolute sense to tag on a little free holiday accommodation either side. Hasn’t Shona moved somewhere down there?I don’t want to sound grumpy and unwelcoming. 

On the contrary, I would like to think my door is always open to friends and family and that we are the kind of relaxed, laid-back household that can absorb last minute, spontaneous guests with aplomb. But the reality is I have four children at home on summer holiday and a job.

Chores: Constant visitors has meant lots of extra cooking and cleaning for Shona - and she's not happy

Hard work: Barbecues have become a constant feature of life and are taking up a lot of Shona's time

I am not, despite appearances, on annual leave. And no. Arriving with one potted chrysanthemum picked up from the nearest garage forecourt is not a sufficient offering if you are going to hang around for four days.

And it’s really hard work having houseguests. Just last week, Keith’s father came to stay and complained (in the nicest possible way) that the mattress on the spare bed was a little lumpy. 'I didn’t sleep too well last night,' he mentioned at breakfast. 'I might just chill out in the garden today. Are you barbecuing for lunch?'

Perhaps it’s my fault and I should be more blunt. But instead of pointing at the charcoal and saying, 'there you go — help yourself,' I rushed out, bought a new double mattress and stopped at the butcher’s on the way home.

It doesn’t surprise me in the least that a recent poll found we spend £5 billion a year putting up visitors. And one in five harassed hosts find their houseguests annoying as well as expensive. Visitors who expect to be waited on and those who make too much noise were deemed the most irritating.

This isn’t my biggest bugbear. It’s the fact that when you live somewhere that everybody else goes on holiday to, they either expect you to be on holiday as well or to facilitate their relaxation.

The fact that I have a deadline, a garden to mow and four pairs of school shoes to purchase for September falls on the seemingly deaf ears of my Prosecco-sipping houseguests. 

All they want are long lunches followed by a snooze on the beach. The temptation to join them would be overwhelming if only I didn’t have to dash to the supermarket to buy dinner for eleven before heading home to prepare it.

The end is, thankfully, almost in sight. I just have to wave goodbye to my current visitors to do yet another exhausting one-day turnaround in time to welcome the next lot for the Bank Holiday weekend.

I was going to say I will then close (and bolt) my front door with a huge sigh of relief. If only! But a distant relative — third cousin, twice removed — called from New Zealand last night 'for a catch up,' and happened to mention, just in passing, that she was planning a UK trip in October. 

'I’ve heard Devon is quite nice in the autumn,' she hinted. 'Do you have a spare room?'
