Felicity Cloake has just made a batch of chocolate chip cookies.

They are luxurious yet light, as big as hockey pucks, completely scrumptious and oh yes, I'd love another, thank you.

However, according to Felicity, they're not perfect. Repeat, not perfect.

Felicity Cloake takes inspiration from other celebrity chefs then makes the recipe her own

'I chopped the chocolate far too much,' she says.

She pours a cup of excellent coffee and pushes it across her kitchen table. The coffee is not perfect, either. 'It's not Fairtrade,' she sighs. 'I feel slightly guilty about that. I fight a battle every time I go to the supermarket.'

Such standards! Yet perhaps we should expect nothing less from the woman known as the Perfect Cook.

In her three cookbooks and her newspaper and magazine columns, Felicity's mission is to rigorously test established recipes to find the best elements.

She then uses these to produce the perfect dish, using the expertise from established cookery authors. She does this with a quiet authority one can only admire.

'People get touchy about others offering advice on how to cook. You set yourself up with a high bar when you call something perfect. It makes you anxious about everything.'

She is 31, with a scrubbed face and uncomplicated hair. She oozes trustworthiness the way a figgy pudding oozes spicy fumes.

When she read English at St Peter's College, Oxford, she had no idea she'd end up winning awards as a food writer and become the go-to cook for the best way to make coffee and walnut cake or beef stew.

'I'm not a trained cook,' she says. 'I certainly couldn't say I was an expert chef. But I would say that I'm a moderately good cook for the amount of practice I've had. And I've had an awful lot of practice. Five years of cooking relentlessly.'

It is her meticulous approach that sets Felicity apart. Each week she selects a dish, then sources five or six recipes for it from her collection of over 200 cookbooks.

Her library includes titles from Elizabeth David, Simon Hopkinson, Nigel Slater, Delia Smith, Jamie Oliver and Nigella.

Felicity doesn't make much of Nigella's tiramisu

Then, in her ordinary kitchen with her four-burner hob and 'bog-standard' domestic fan oven, she rigorously tests these recipes.

Finally, taking the best elements from each, she will create a master recipe. Recent triumphs include clam chowder (thicken with flour, not crackers), coffee and walnut cake (Nigel's is better than Nigella's) and tiramisu (Jamie Oliver adds orange, Felicity does not approve).

To this end, her life is spent cooking and shopping, then doing more shopping before cooking. From the three-storey townhouse in Islington, north London, which she shares with barrister boyfriend Richard and her dog, a cairn terrier called Wilf, she sallies forth with empty bags and returns laden.

When I visit, she's made six batches of goulash, concluding that shin of beef is the best cut to use, as recommended by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. The house pulsates with the rich aroma of paprika and lard, while the fridge is crammed with tubs of goulash.

The thing that bothers her most is the wastage. What can you do with six goulashes? 'Last night, Richard almost rebelled.

'He said to me, “Not goulash again!” I said, “Come on, man up! We've got to get through this. Me and the dog can't eat it all.” I mean, look at Wilf. That's why he's a little bit fat.'

Felicity's new cookbook, Perfect Too, has 92 recipes that have gone through her strict tests. It's an entertaining read, even if you've never picked up a saucepan in your life.

However, she likes to choose recipes that 'most people who cook a bit will know something about'.

Over the next three weeks, some of them will be serialised in Weekend, including tarte au citron and beef Wellington.

The kind of straightforward grub that's popular and delicious is Felicity's speciality. Everything is subjective, she feels, but there are a few recipes she thinks she finessed until they were spot on.

'A ragu Bolognese, which I think is pretty perfect. A moussaka I thought I really cracked.' But she's not dictatorial and says authenticity can be overrated. 'If it works for you, go for it.' Neither is she a slavish respecter of culinary reputations. For her, it's all about what works.

She's not afraid to suggest Delia might have got it wrong, or Elizabeth David's recipes are too underpowered for the modern palate.

She also dismisses the efforts of Pippa Middleton. 'I haven't used her recipes, although I'm sure they're wonderful. I did see her book in the Oxfam shop window and I contemplated going in and buying it but I had the dog with me so I didn't. Oh, that sounds catty! I just think Pippa and I are doing different things.'

How did we get here? Felicity grew up in Hertfordshire where her father was a John Lewis executive and her mother was a French teacher.

'I dislike lemon curd, tinned tuna makes
 me heave, I hate parsnips and I'm not keen on parsley. I don't like 
truffles either. They're sort of armpitty.'

Her first food memory is gnawing a plastic-wrapped Stilton, nicked off a supermarket shelf when she was in her buggy. She went to board at Rugby at 13, and remembers making fudge on rainy Sundays.

After university, she went into publishing. 'I had a dream of discovering the next JK Rowling.' Instead, she discovered herself, and her super-charged taste buds – which are surprisingly fussy. 'I dislike lemon curd, tinned tuna makes me heave, I hate parsnips and I'm not keen on parsley. I don't like truffles either. They're sort of armpitty.'

Felicity's books promote nourishing food. She was appalled by a recent survey that claimed the most popular evening meal in the UK is sandwiches.

'People say they don't have time to cook, yet the average person spends four hours a day watching TV. It's a life skill. People should know how to do it.' She cites Nigella's spaghetti and Marmite as an easy home-made supper.

'Chefs on TV make it too complicated, but it doesn't have to be like that.'

So what did everyone have to eat today at Felicity Towers? The menu went like this. Felicity had avocado on toast and a biscuit, Wilf had squid, Richard made himself a plate of tuna with Felicity's roasted garlic salsa and leftover lamb-rice.

'He mixed it all together into a sludge, put Japanese mayonnaise on top and ate it. Revolting,' she says. But at least it was home-made.
