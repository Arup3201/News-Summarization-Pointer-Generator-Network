Ministers are drawing up plans for a new crackdown on migrants’ access to benefits to try to win back disaffected voters from Ukip.

The new push, which could see unemployed EU nationals kicked out of the country after just six months, was announced yesterday amid continued fallout from the Ukip surge in last week’s elections.

Currently, new arrivals cannot claim benefits for the first three months in the country followed by six months in which they can.

Unemployment: Ministers announced new plans to crackdown on migrants' access to benefits. But with most EU migrants in work and not claiming, it would most likely have little effect on soaring net migration figures

Yesterday Home Secretary Theresa May confirmed plans to cut the period in which migrants can claim benefits to just three months.

And Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith told The Sunday Times it would be ‘bye bye’ for anyone who had not found work after half a year in the UK.

However, the policy faces opposition from the Liberal Democrats, who are yet to sign off on the idea.

Critics claimed the policy would have 
little impact on David Cameron’s drive to reduce net migration below 
100,000 before the next election, as it would have no effect on the tens
 of thousands of arrivals each year who do go on to find work.

And
 questions were raised about the likelihood of large numbers of 
unemployed EU nationals being removed from the UK when ministers 
struggle to throw out foreign criminals.

Crackdown:: Home Secretary Theresa May yesterday confirmed plans to cut the period in which migrants can claim benefits to just three months

Despite concern about the rise of Ukip, Mr Cameron appears to have escaped the harsh criticism from backbenchers that has dogged Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg since Thursday.

Yesterday the only murmurings of discontent came from former shadow home secretary David Davis, who called on Mr Cameron to bring forward by a year to 2016 the proposed referendum on membership of the EU.

He said the current policy lacked ‘clarity and credibility’. And he criticised the government’s failure to bring immigration ‘back under control’.

He wrote: ‘The Conservative party has to decide pretty soon where its blue lines are and make them very clear. If we do not grasp this nettle, I can see the Ukip resurgence carrying all the way through to the General Election.’

A poll carried out by Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft in marginal seats, suggested Labour had a comfortable 12-point lead over the Tories and showed there was still strong support for Ukip. 

The survey of key ‘swing’ seats put Labour at 41 per cent, the Tories on 29 and UKIP was on 18 per cent. If repeated next year it could hand Ed Miliband a comfortable majority.

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he believed most of those who voted Ukip at the local and European elections last week were ‘lender voters’ who would return to the Tories for the General Election next year.

He told Sky News the government had to address ‘specific concerns ... about immigration and about Europe’.

He added: ‘Ukip is a protest party; most of the people who are voting for Ukip – not all of them, but most of them – are disillusioned voters of other parties who moved to Ukip to send us a message and we’ve got a year to show that we’ve got that message.’

Downing Street sources dismissed Mr Davis’s call to move the referendum forward, saying it wouldn’t make the ‘slightest difference on the doorstep’.

However, Mr Hammond said ministers would try to resurrect a proposal to enshrine the EU referendum pledge in law.

Mrs May accepted it had ‘become more difficult’ for ministers to hit their target of cutting net migration – the number of people arriving minus those departing -  to below 100,000 by the time of the next election.

Last week figures showed a sharp increase in arrivals from the EU made that target a distant prospect.

But she said should would ‘continue working to bring it down’.

She also indicated the proposals on benefits were facing opposition from the Lib Dems. At the moment arrivals have three months to try and find work during which they cannot claim benefits, followed by six in which they can.

She added: ‘We haven't yet got agreement across the coalition to do that. But these are the sorts of measures we keep looking at because in immigration you can never stand still.’

‘It is no surprise to anybody that there have been some long-standing, possibly heated at times, discussions among the coalition on some of these issues of immigration.’

The effect of the change would be to halve the length of time when migrants can claim benefits in Britain from six months to three.

However, there were immediately questions about the likelihood of large numbers being removed from the country even if they weren’t working.

Even if it was implemented, such a policy would have little difference on overall numbers of migrants because most EU immigrants do not claim benefits and are in work.
