Two 'frightened' Lottery winners have moved out of their home after thieves broke in while they were celebrating their £45million EuroMillions windfall, it has been revealed.

Matt Topham and Cassey Carrington, from Stapleford, Nottingham, have left their £80,000 semi to stay with Mr Topham's father and his stepmother.

The burglars fled empty handed after being disturbed, but the engaged couple were said to be 'sickened' by the break-in and have moved most of their belongings out of their home - even fitting an alarm.

However, the 22-year-olds, who won the life-changing sum last month, don't seem too down as they have just splashed out on two new luxury cars to replace their £7,000 
Peugeot 107 city car.

Mr
Topham, a painter and decorator, has bought a Jaguar XKR-S, costing 
£109,000, and Miss Carrington, a supervisor at Iceland, picked out a 
£50,000 white Range Rover Evoque. Both sets of wheels have the new '12' 
registration plates.

Mr Topham was pictured driving his new car his 
local Tesco this week, turning heads in the car-park.

The break-in happened the night the couple were named publicly as winners, last month. The news attracted much attention from the press.

Neighbour Susan Naylor, 66, told the 
Sunday Mirror said: 'I heard a bump outside at about 11.30pm. The side 
gate of the house had been forced open. They've since taken most of 
their things away and fitted an alarm.'

However, it wont be long before they move into their new, slightly larger three-bedroom house in Nottingham - no doubt with top-of-the-range security - once it's has been decorated.

It comes as it was revealed that the another UK ticket holder has scooped £22.1million following Friday night's EuroMillions Lottery draw - but has yet to come forward with claim the life-changing prize.

The new multi-millionaire is the fourth Briton in recent months to hit the jackpot. The numbers were 5, 6, 11, 30, 44 with the lucky stars 2 and 6.

Last month, Mr Topham and Miss Carrington admitted that also on their shopping list was a new computer and washing machine 
because their old ones had broken within minutes of each other on the 
morning of the draw.

At a press conference last month the couple vowed to ‘look after our 
friends and family first’.

Mr Topham works for his father Brian as a 
painter and decorator and made numerous references to him, along with 
his siblings.

The couple said they owe their new-found fortune to a lucky dip 
ticket.

Mr Topham, member of the Air Training Corps in his youth, said he wanted to pay 
for flying lessons with his winnings in order to learn to fly 
‘helicopters and planes’.

Miss Carrington added that while they had no plans to move their 
September wedding reception from their existing, secret venue, or change
Miss Carrington’s ‘dream’ dress, they would be upgrading to a suite on 
their foreign honeymoon.

The win came days after she had won a share of a £10,000 bonus awarded 
to staff at her store in Eastwood, Nottingham. Miss Carrington said she 
would hand back her share, amounting to ‘a few hundred pounds’ for her 
old colleagues to share between them.

She had worked at the store since leaving school and supervised 20 
staff. A former colleague at the branch said they were ‘really made up 
for her’.
