A 20-year-old man who posted a vile Facebook message saying ‘all soldiers should die and go to hell’ just two days after six British soldiers were killed in Afghanistan has today avoided jail.

Azhar Ahmed, of Ravensthorpe, West Yorkshire, admitted posting the message - and was charged after the mother of one of the soldiers read the comments and was so upset she called police.

Nathalie Taylor, mother of Corporal Jake Hartley, 20, said she was ‘physically sick’ after reading the comments and that Ahmed ‘completely disrespected his memory and those of his fellow soldiers’.

The remarks were also called ‘derogatory, disrespectful and inflammatory’ by a district judge at Huddersfield Magistrates’ Court who found him guilty of sending a grossly offensive communication.

Sergeant Nigel Coupe, 33, Cpl Hartley, 20, Private Anthony Frampton, 20, Pte Christopher Kershaw, 19, Pte Daniel Wade, 20, and Pte Daniel Wilford, 21, died in a blast in Kandahar province in March.

Ahmed told a trial he did not think what he had written was offensive. His message said: ‘People gassin about the deaths of Soldiers! What about the innocent familys who have been brutally killed.

‘The women who have been raped. The children who have been sliced up! Your enemy’s were the Taliban not innocent harmful familys. All soldiers should DIE & go to HELL! THE LOWLIFE F****N SCUM!

‘Gotta problem. Go cry at your soldiers grave and wish him hell because that’s where he is going.’

Ahmed told the court at his trial last month that he deleted the post as soon as he realised what reaction it was having.

'The women who have been raped. The children who have been sliced up! Your enemy’s were the Taliban not innocent harmful familys. All soldiers should DIE & go to HELL! THE LOWLIFE F****N SCUM!'

Azhar Ahmed's Facebook comments

He said he replied with apologies to many people who commented on his page and when some told him they had lost relatives in Afghanistan he realised how serious it was.

But he denied the message was grossly offensive and said he thought it would just have been upsetting and caused distress.

The trial heard that the parents of one of the six soldiers who died in the incident saw the posting, which was copied around the internet.

During today’s sentencing at Huddersfield Magistrates’ Court, Nicholas Barker, defending Ahmed, said it was a ‘serious matter’ but not one that warranted custody.

He said Ahmed was initially voicing 
‘legitimate concerns’ about the victims of war but went on to overstep 
the mark. When he realised his latter comments were causing distress, he
 removed them, Mr Barker added.

District Judge Jane Goodwin said the law should not stop legitimate political opinions being strongly voiced. But she said the test was whether what was written was ‘beyond the pale of what’s tolerable in our society’.

She ruled Ahmed’s posting was not tolerable and said: ‘I’m satisfied that the message was grossly offensive’.

He was given a two-year community order with 240 hours of community service and ordered to pay £300 in costs at today’s hearing.

Outside court, Mrs Taylor criticised the sentence, saying: ‘He should have been sent to jail. They should have made an example of him to ensure other people realise that they just can't do this.

‘I'm happy that he has been caught and sentenced. Though I wish he had gone to jail, it sounds like he is going to be paying back the community.’

'It was so upsetting for me to see that and it was very hard for the family to deal with. I went completely numb and fortunately can't recall the wording' 

Mrs Taylor

But she added that she found the ‘sick message’ less than 24 hours after finding out her son had died, and ‘completely lost it for around an hour and was physically sick’.

Mrs Taylor said: ‘It was so upsetting for me to see that and it was very hard for the family to deal with. I went completely numb and fortunately can't recall the wording.

‘I just remember feeling sick and upset. He (Cpl Hartley) gave his life for this country then in such a short time Ahmed has completely disrespected his memory and those of his fellow soldiers.

‘It's very easy to sit behind your computer writing whatever you please when there are soldiers fighting for the freedom of speech which these people hide behind.’
