Police have warned Parisians they could be jailed for sunbathing topless in parks and on riverbanks during the warm summer weather.

A notice posted on the Paris police website states there must be ‘no breasts or private parts’ on show while sunbathing.

Thousands of locals flock to the River Seine in August, where the city has created a sandy beach with deckchairs.

Relaxing by the river: Every July and August, temporary artificial beaches are created

But the police have now told sun lovers: 'When the thermometer rises a few degrees, you may put on your best bathing suit and find a little corner of grass or the welcoming banks of the Seine to put down your towel.

'But please note that bathing suits should not be worn in official city parks and that dress should be decent and in accordance with good morals and public order.
