Schools should teach pupils to speak eloquently to help ‘grunting’ and ‘monosyllabic’ teenagers, according to a former speechwriter for Tony Blair.

Peter Hyman argued that not enough teaching time was devoted to developing speaking skills and criticised an assumption that quiet classrooms were best.

Speaking eloquently was key to finding work but oral skills were an ‘undervalued’ part of the curriculum, he said.

Mr Hyman, who is now a head teacher of a London free school, said schools needed to help ‘dispel the myth of the grunting teenager, the monosyllabic teenager.’

He also criticised last year’s decision to remove the speaking and listening mark from the final grade in GCSE English, pointing out that oral exams were still regarded as intrinsic to foreign language qualifications.

Learning to speak eloquently was becoming ‘a moral issue’ because it is crucial to success in life, he told the Times Educational Supplement.

‘If you can speak and articulate yourself properly, that will happen,’ he said.

‘But it’s also the number one issue that employers put in all their surveys: they want good oral communication.’

He added: ‘We’ve got to dispel the myth of the grunting teenager, the monosyllabic teenager that make employers say “I’ve got this person who I know on paper is quite good, but they can’t string a sentence together”.’

Mr Hyman, who now runs School 21, a new free school in Newham, east London, said the general trend was moving further away from encouraging pupils to develop their speaking and communication skills.

A fashion for quiet classrooms is wrong and pupils should spend time discussing ideas and debating with each other, he insisted.

‘Speaking aids thinking, speaking aids depth of knowledge, speaking aids writing,’ he said.

‘I think some people out there think the silent classroom is the good classroom, but the silent classroom is the death of learning, unless there’s a particular reason for it.’

Mr Hyman added: ‘I think there’s too much of a fashion now of saying "the quieter the better, that shows you’ve got behaviour under control".

‘I think that is completely the wrong way to go and we’ve got to put speaking up there on a completely equal footing with reading and writing.’

Mr Hyman told TES that he wanted to go around the classrooms of his school, and hear children talking to each other, discussing, debating and questioning.

The spoken word, he said, was ‘built into the DNA of the school’.

Mr Hyman made the remarks part-way through a pilot project with the University of Cambridge which is testing a range of ways teachers can boost and assess students’ talking skills.

Professor Neil Mercer, director of the project, said policy makers would take speech more seriously as a subject if it could be formally assessed.

‘The government has tended to blow hot and cold on talk in schools,’ he said.

‘It tends to be taken for granted, but it’s important to children’s development in so many ways.

‘Speaking and listening is included in the primary curriculum now but in secondary it is there in a token way and not nearly enough to develop children’s life skills.’
