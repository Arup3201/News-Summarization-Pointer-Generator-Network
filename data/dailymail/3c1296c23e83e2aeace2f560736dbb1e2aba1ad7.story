Love it or hate it, most of us feel compelled to count in the New Year at midnight, whether celebrating at a party or freezing outside watching fireworks.

But while the average Briton calls it a night at 01:38am, people in Russia party through the night and stay up the latest in the world, according to data gathered from hundreds of thousands of Jawbone Up wearers.

Over the past year, wearers of the fitness tracker has recorded their every movement - including their sleeping patterns  - to provide fresh insight into how the world celebrates New Year.

Happy New Year! Data collected by Jawbone's wearable fitness bands has been used to compile a map (pictured) showing how people around the world celebrate the New Year. People in Russia stay up the latest on December 31, while those in China and Iran turn in early, because they celebrate New Year on another night 

The data revealed that last year, Russians stayed up the latest, followed by people in the Ukraine and Argentina.

In Russia, New Year’s Eve is a 'super-holiday' where Christmas and the night of celebrations is combined.

Familiar Christmas traditions such as exchanging gifts, visiting family, telling children about Santa Claus - who is known as Father Frost - and decorating trees are combined with New Year’s revelry and celebrated on the first of January.

Data was gathered from hundreds of thousands of people who wear Jawbone Up smart bands (pictured left) which track wearer's steps and sleeping patterns. It revealed that last year, the average Briton went to sleep at  01:38am, having welcomed in the New Year, perhaps by watching the annual firework displays in London (pictured right) or the traditional festivities in Edinburgh

Similarly, the research found that most cities in South America and continental Europe stayed awake into the small hours. 

Of course, in Argentina, Chile and Brazil, the celebrations fall in the summer, allowing many people to party on the beach.

In contrast, people in China and Israel were asleep last year earlier than other countries, probably because their New Year’s traditions, which stretch back thousands of years, are celebrated on different days.

A total of 88 per cent of Britons wearing Jawbone activity tracking bands stayed awake past midnight last year, with the average Londoner going to bed at 2am and waking up at 9.36am on New Year’s Day.

Around three in 10 Americans skipped the midnight countdown last year in favour of catching some extra shut-eye.

Jawbone’s data revealed that the west coast goes to bed particularly early, typically three hours after the ball has dropped in Times Square and 19 hours after the first fireworks in Sydney.

It has been suggested that people living in Los Angeles prefer an alternative tradition: the Rose Parade, which begins at 8am on New Year’s Day.

Almost 48 per cent of Jawbone wearers in Pasadena – a southern Californian town - were asleep by midnight, for example.

But not all cities in the US go to bed so early, with people in New York and Miami partying hard into the night.

While people in China and Israel are the earliest to bed on December 31, they have their own distinctive New Year’s Eve traditions, as well as celebrating the Gregorian New Year.

Staying up until midnight is not part of Israel’s Rosh Hashanah tradition, which begins on September 13 next year, so sleep is minimally disrupted.

It is the first of the High Holy Days which usually occur in the early autumn of the Northern Hemisphere.

The day is believed to be the anniversary of the creation of Adam and Eve and to celebrate, the shofar (a hollowed out ram's horn) is sounded and symbolic foods such as apples dipped in honey are eaten.

However, on Chinese New Year, which is celebrated on February 19 next year, 800 million people stay up late with their families to watch the largest TV broadcast on the planet, the CCTV New Year’s Gala, which ushers in the New Year.

Only Hong Kong stays up later to celebrate the New Year later than the Chinese New Year, according to the data.

Within China, regional customs and traditions concerning the celebration of the Chinese New Year vary widely.

It is common for families to gather for dinner and to cleanse their homes to sweep away bad luck and make way for incoming fortune.

Windows and doors are often decorated with red paper and decorations denoting good fortune, happiness, wealth and longevity.

Lighting firecrackers and giving money in red paper envelopes are also popular customs.
