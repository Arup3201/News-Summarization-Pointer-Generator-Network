Disability campaigners yesterday demanded new laws for wheelchair users after judges ruled they have no legal priority to use reserved areas on a bus.

Appeal judges said that a mother with a baby buggy was within her rights to occupy a bus wheelchair bay, leading to a disabled passenger being left behind at the stop.

The state-funded Equality and Human Rights Commission, which had brought the case of disabled passenger Doug Paulley to court, said: ‘This judgment means a wheelchair user has no effective legal rights if unable to gain access to a bus because a traveller blocks the designated wheelchair space.’

Bus companies do not have to force parents with pushchairs to make way for wheelchair users on buses, the Court of Appeal has ruled. It comes after an appeal by operator First Group, which had been ordered to pay £5,500 damages to wheelchair user Doug Paulley (pictured)

Mr Paulley was denied access to a bus in February 2012 after a woman with a sleeping baby refused to move

Its disability commissioner Chris Holmes added: ‘The Commission will study the judgments before deciding whether to support an appeal for legislative changes to make sure disabled people can use bus travel.’ The case came after Mr Paulley was told he could not board a bus after a woman refused to move her buggy and make room.

A judge at Leeds County Court ruled the bus company, FirstGroup, was in breach of its duty under the Equality Act 2010 to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people, and awarded £5,500 damages to Mr Paulley.

But this decision suggested the needs of wheelchair users ‘trumped all other considerations’, one of the appeal judges said yesterday.

Lord Justice Lewison, sitting with Lady Justice Arden and Lord Justice Underhill, said there was no law which says bus companies must force selfish passengers to make space for a wheelchair. 

Instead, they ruled that the 'proper remedy' for wheelchair users to get improvements in such cases is to ask Parliament.

But Lady Justice Arden, sitting with Lord Justice Lewison and Lord Justice Underhill at the Court of Appeal (pictured), unanimously allowed an appeal by First Group

Common decency meant other passengers should move from the wheelchair space 'if that was possible', or drivers should instead ‘persuade’ passengers to do the right thing.

But, in law, the needs of wheelchair users did not 'trump all other considerations'. 

Lord Justice Lewison said: 'The judge seems to me to have thought that the needs of wheelchair users trumped all other considerations.

Mr Paulley, 36, from Wetherby, West Yorkshire, tried to catch the number 99 to Leeds in February 2012. 

The driver asked him to wait before getting aboard because a woman with a pram was in the wheelchair space, and asked her to fold the buggy. She replied that the buggy did not fold, and refused to move.

The driver then left Mr Paulley behind because he did not think there was a safe place to secure his wheelchair on the bus.

Lord Justice Lewison said the case was ‘not about whether non-wheelchair users should move out to accommodate a passenger in a wheelchair. Of course they should if possible.’

Drivers should instead be taught to pile pressure on selfish passengers, Lady Justice Arden said. They should even refuse to move off from the stop if passengers block disabled customers, she added. 

Lord Justice Underhill said: 'It has to be accepted that our conclusion and reasoning in this case means that wheelchair users will occasionally be prevented by other passengers from using the wheelchair space on the bus.

The judges ruled that common decency meant other passengers should move from the wheelchair space 'if that was possible'. But, in law, the needs of wheelchair users did not 'trump all other considerations'

'Sometimes there will be a reasonable justification for that happening, but sometimes there will not.

'I do not, however, believe that the fact that some passengers will - albeit rarely - act selfishly and irresponsibly is a sufficient reason for imposing on bus companies a legal responsibility for a situation which is not of their making and which they are not in a position to prevent.

'In the present state of the law something must still be left to the good sense and conscience of individuals.' 

Lady Justice Arden added: 'It follows from the judgments of this court that the proper remedy for wheelchair users is to ask Parliament to strengthen the powers of bus drivers so that they could, for instance, require people to vacate the wheelchair space, or create new duties on other passengers, or to campaign for a different design of buses.

'In that way, a greater number of wheelchair users would be able to use the wheelchair space.'

The judge said she did not underestimate the difficulties of travel for wheelchair users 'or their frustration at the pace of change'.

February 24, 2012: Doug Paulley, was prevented from travelling on a First Group bus to Leeds. The driver refused to make a mother with a pushchair leave the space because it would wake up her baby

September 2013: A judge at Leeds County Court ruled the 'first come first served' policy was unlawful discrimination in breach of the Equality Act 2010. First Group was given six months to change its policy

November 2014: Martin Chamberlain QC, for First Group, appealed against the ruling, claiming it was an example of a long-running problem on public transport that had produced conflicting court decisions and bus operators were now seeking legal clarity.

December 2014: Lady Justice Arden, sitting with Lord Justice Lewison and Lord Justice Underhill, said there was no law which says bus companies must force selfish passengers to make space for a wheelchair. Drivers should instead 'persuade' passengers to do the right thing.

The judge added: 'It is obvious that, as one wheelchair user has said, for them the world was not built with a ramp.'

However the only question the court had to answer was whether it would be reasonable for the First Group bus company to have to adopt the policy in favour of wheelchair users proposed by Mr Paulley.

The judge said the answer to that question 'in the current circumstances is no'. 

Mr Paulley, from Wetherby in Yorkshire, attempted to board the bus to visit his parents in Leeds on February 24th, 2012.

But he was told to wait for another when the woman with the pushchair refused to move because her baby was asleep.

A judge at Leeds County Court ruled that First's policy of 'requesting but not requiring' non-disabled travellers, to move out of the space if it is needed by a wheelchair user was in breach of the Equality Act 2010. He awarded Mr Paulley £5,500 damages.

Lord Lewison said that Mr Paulley has asked to appeal to the Supreme Court, but the judges refused permission to appeal. He added that he felt it was up to the Supreme Court to decide if they felt it was 'appropiate' to take the case. 

Mr Paulley's case was funded in court by the Equality and Human Rights Commission,

Mr Paulley described how on February 24 2012 he tried to board a number 99 bus at Wetherby to Leeds to take a train to visit his parents at Oldham.

He said: 'Somebody got there just before me and put a pushchair in the wheelchair space. The bus driver asked her to leave, but she refused so I was not allowed on the bus.

'I ended up missing my train and arriving at my parents an hour late.'

Mr Paulley added: 'We are saying it is a reasonable adjustment for a bus company, as a service provider, to insist wheelchair space be made available if needed.'

Mr Paulley said that he might appear to be 'a confident guy' coming to court to fight for the rights of the disabled.

But the problems posed by getting access to public transport 'impact on my confidence quite a lot'.

He said: 'It is a question of not only not knowing whether you are going to be able to get on to a bus but whether there is going to be some conflict.

'Inter-personal conflict is not very pleasant. It is one of the many stresses of getting around in a wheelchair.' 

Campaigners for young disabled people said the ruling 'can only worsen the situation, particularly for those in rural areas who may heavily rely on bus services.'

Victoria Wright, speaking for the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign Trailblazers, a network of young disabled people, said: 'We are frustrated and extremely disappointed by this decision, which means that wheelchair users do not have priority, in law, over wheelchair spaces on those buses that they are actually able to board.

'Travelling by public transport with a young child and buggy can be difficult and stressful - as a mother myself I am all too aware of this. However, the reality is that even today, many disabled people already find themselves unable to rely on public transport to commute to work, get to school or college or to travel to vital appointments like hospital visits.

'The UK's transport network, buses, trains and taxis alike, is still widely inaccessible and unpredictable, often leaving disabled people facing long delays and hugely increased journey times. This ruling can only worsen the situation, particularly for those in rural areas who may heavily rely on bus services.

'We will be closely monitoring how young disabled people are affected by the court's decision and the next steps needed to ensure the rights of wheelchair users are protected.'
