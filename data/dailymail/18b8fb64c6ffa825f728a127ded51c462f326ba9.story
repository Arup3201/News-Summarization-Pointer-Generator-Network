The lovable Dan French wowed fans back in 2011 when she unveiled her sleek new look after losing a staggering seven stone in weight.

But despite wearing slimming black as she arrived for the latest round of Australia's Got Talent auditions in Sydney on Sunday, she couldn't disguise that she had regained some of her curves.

The Vicar of Dibley star was 19 stone two years ago before sheÂ went on a strict diet that included cutting out chocolate and carbohydrates.

Sticking to black: Dawn French kept things simple in an all-black outfit as she arrived for the Australia's Got Talent auditions in Sydney, Australia, on Sunday

Dawn was 19 stone before she embarked on her diet (left) and shed seven stone in 2011 (right)

The diet had been for health not confidence reasons as she said: 'I've never disliked myself at all'.

However she later admitted she found denying herself bread and pasta too difficult and she had put three stone back on.

Many people can attest that diets take courage to start and even more willpower and determination to stick to.

Here, Femail remembers the other showbiz dieters who have fallen victim to the yo-yo diet trap.
