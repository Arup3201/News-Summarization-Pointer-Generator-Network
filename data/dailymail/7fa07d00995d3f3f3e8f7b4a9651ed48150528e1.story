Manchester City striker John Guidetti may yet join Celtic on loan after the Scottish FA confirmed it will appeal to FIFA on the club's behalf to get the loan move ratified.

Guidetti travelled to Glasgow on Monday for talks as Celtic moved to complete their second striker signing of Deadline Day following the capture of Stefan Scepovic from Sporting Gijon on a four-year deal.

The 22-year-old Swede's move was initiated but was unable to be completed before Monday's 11pm deadline.

Disappointment: John Guidetti travelled to Celtic for talks but the paperwork failed to arrive at SFA

A Scottish FA spokesman said: 'We will be contacting FIFA on Celtic's behalf to request an "exception" in order for the transfer to be concluded.'

'It was chaos yesterday. I don't think I ate all day,' Guidetti told newspaper Sportbladet as he arrived on Sweden's west coast for duty with the Under 21 side.

'It was just wait, wait, wait. Hundreds of fans stood outside the stadium and waited in the middle of the night,' said Guidetti, who had been told that he was surplus to requirements at the Etihad Stadium.

It looked like the wait was in vain, for him and the fans, but media in Scotland reported on Tuesday that the Scottish FA had accepted the transfer paperwork and it was now up to world governing body FIFA to judge if the move could be approved.

'I hope that it sorts itself out with Celtic, otherwise I'll have to stay at City and that's not the worst thing that could happen,' Guidetti said. 'Unfortunately, the papers weren't finished in time and now it's up to FIFA to decide.'

Celtic needed to register Guidetti with UEFA last night in order for him to be eligible for the Europa League group stages.

Guidetti, who joined City from Swedish side IF Brommapojkarna in 2008, spent the second half of last season on loan at Stoke where he mustered six appearances without scoring. 

He had a far more prolific spell with Feyenoord three years ago when he notched 20 goals in 23 appearances.

Serbian striker Stefan Scepovic became the only transfer fee paid in the Scottish window when his second u-turn in 24 hours teed up a £2.2million move from Sporting Gijon.

The deal for No 1 target Scepovic ended a rollercoaster pursuit when Celtic declared themselves 'disgusted' by his decision to sign for Spanish club Getafe instead.

By mid-afternoon, however, Spanish league Financial Fair Play regulations had wrecked that deal - forcing the striker's agents to go cap in hand to Celtic begging for a reprieve.
