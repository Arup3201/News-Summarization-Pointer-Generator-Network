Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, Prince George's new nanny, is apparently listed on a register in her native Palencia, northern Spain, for failing to pay the Spanish equivalent of council tax

Prince George’s new Spanish ‘supernanny’ is facing claims that she is a tax dodger.

Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, 43, is apparently  listed on a register in her native Palencia, northern Spain, for failing to pay the Spanish equivalent of council tax.

Miss Borrallo, who studied at the elite Norland College in Bath, apparently appeared on the online register – known as the Official Provincial Gazette - in May 2007 and July 2008 for failing to pay property tax, known as IBI.

However, a source told the Daily Mirror that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s new full-time nanny had now resolved the issue and no longer owed council chiefs any money.

The source said: ‘It’s a major source of embarrassment to her that her name is still on a public debtors’ list which is just a click of a mouse away.

‘Maria Teresa might like to see it removed from the public arena but there’s absolutely nothing she can do about it.’

Miss Borrallo was appointed by Kensington Palace a couple of weeks ago but was only named officially last Thursday.

She will be joining the royal couple and their young son on their forthcoming tour of Australia and New Zealand.

Council officials in Palencia said they could not confirm when Miss Borrallo settled her debts but a spokesman told the Daily Mirror: ‘The gazettes enable public institutions to defend themselves against those who don’t want to pay taxes they owe as it means they can’t go round claiming they haven’t been informed.’

Earlier this week, friends claimed the Spanish nanny would have become a nun if she had not ended up pursuing her passion for looking after children.

They said her austere lifestyle made her the perfect candidate to become a servant of God.

One said: ‘We all thought she would end up becoming a nun because she was such a different girl to the rest. She hardly had any friends and she didn’t show any interest in boys.’

Miss Borrallo, nicknamed Santa - Spanish for saint – by those closest to her when she was a youngster, was born in Madrid but moved to Palencia as a child. She is the second eldest of four children.

She attended church regularly with the rest of her family as she was growing up and locals in her home city said they would not have been surprised if she had ended up choosing a church job like her brother Luis, who ordained a deacon in 2011.

However, she instead decided to travel to England where she spent three years at the prestigious Norland College, where childcare training costs £36,000 and graduates learn the art of taekwondo and stunt driving.

A spokesman for Kensington Palace said they would not be commenting about Miss Borrallo's tax but said they remained 'very happy' she had been appointed.
