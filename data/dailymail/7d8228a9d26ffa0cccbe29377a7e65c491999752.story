Tragic: Former Belgian prime minister Dehaene (left) has died following a fall in France

UEFA has been informed of his death but it is unclear what affect it will have on the ongoing case in relation to sanctions for Manchester City's FFP rule breaches, though a further delay is likely.

Dehaene was chairman of the Club Football Control Body (CFCB) and it is understood he had been struggling with his illness during recent weeks.

He still took an active role in the investigations and had been kept updated with all the documentation.

City have been made a settlement offer of sanctions including a £49million fine payable over three years, reduction in their Champions League squad from 25 to 21 players, eight of which must be home-trained, and a wage freeze on that squad.

City had argued the sanctions were too harsh and a final decision from the CFCB is still pending.

Dehaene was an important politician in Europe - he helped set up the European Union's constitution and led his nation during the 1990s.

Belgium's current Prime Minister, Elio Di Rupo, said the country "had lost an exceptional statesman. Jean-Luc was a special companion".
