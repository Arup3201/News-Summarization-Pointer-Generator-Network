What do you do when you're a multi-millionaire Premier League superstar and you feel like treating yourself?

Get another expensive car, of course, and no matter if, judging by Manchester United striker Robin van Persie's bulging keyring, your garage is pretty full already.

Earning £180,000 a week (before bonuses), the 30-year-old Dutchman's got to spend it on something, and given the £61,000 price tag of the car in the brochure he's reading, he could easily afford a couple.

You want ANOTHER one? Laughing Robbie Savage shares a table with Robin van Persie and his packed keyring

Fleet of cars: Bouchra and Robin van Persie, seen today in Wilmslow, have several luxury motors to choose from

Van Persie, right, and Savage are both car-mad, but Savage's collection is smaller since he retired from football

Van Persie was spotted in an Alderley Edge coffee shop with football pundit Robbie Savage perusing a luxury car catalogue featuring the Chevrolet Corvette Stingray.  Given that the American car firm sponsors his team, he unlikely to have to pay for it himself.

A sport performance car that can reach 62mph in four-and-a-half seconds, it would join a stable of at least half a dozen expensive cars already littering the van Persie driveway.

And it would be one of his cheaper runabouts, judging by the fobs on the table which belonged to a Porsche, a Range Rover Sport and an Audi A5, worth at least £155,000.

The £12.2 milion-a-year footballer is most often seen out in one of two Porsches: either the sleek, gunmetal grey Porsche Panamera (£63,000), or, when he's with his wife Bouchra and their two children, the larger Porsche Cayenne Techart Magnum 2007 (£125,000).

For trips to the supermarket, Mrs Van Persie likes to drive a white BMW X5 with personalised numberplate (around £44,000), or sometimes the dark grey Range Rover Sport (£52,000).

When they're out without their children they take the black Audi S5 Sportback Sportline (£40,000), which was recently photographed with a parking ticket after they left it at a station car park without buying a ticket when they nipped into Waitrose.

The footballing friends cracked a smile for the camera when they realised they had been recognised in the cafe

Van Persie picked the right person to 
discuss cars with - Robbie Savage shares his passions for motors, and 
boasted a collection of glamorous cars including a Porsche, Lamborghini 
and Aston Martin when he was a £30,000-a-week star in the Premier 
League.

But the former Leicester, Blackburn and Birmingham midfielder reduced his collection after he retired two years ago.

He now drives a slightly more modest £60,000 Mercedes, and last year was spotted buying a 10-year-old Hyundai for £300 at a car auction.
