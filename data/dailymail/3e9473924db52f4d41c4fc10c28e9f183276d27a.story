The opening weekend of the new league season in Macedonia was marred by horrific scenes after a fan tragically had his hand blown off by a police stun grenade.

According to local reports the incident occurred deep into injury-time of the match between local rivals Pelister and Vardar - locally known as the 'Eternal derby of Macedonia'.

As the game entered the closing stages local riot police decided to pen in the visiting Vardar fans.

VIDEO WARNING: Graphic images and video follow below

Tragic: The Vardar fan is clearly in distress after the horrific incident that took place at the weekend

Disturbance: The stun grenade causes chaos in the visiting away section

Agony: The injured man calls for help after losing his left hand in the horrific incident

Chaos: Other fans were also injured during the incident which took place at the weekend

That consequently led to disputes between the away fans and the police. A police officer is then believed to have dropped a stun grenade into the stand causing significant unrest in the Vardar end, before one supporter attempted to pick up the grenade.

Tragically that supporter lost his hand with many others suffering injuries as a result of the incident.

Vardar consequently won the match 1-0, however their manager Sergey Andreyev told reporters after the game that 'this win means nothing when a fan loses a hand'.
