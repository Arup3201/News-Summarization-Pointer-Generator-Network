Judge Lynn Roberts, pictured, ruled Essex County Council must pay a  proportion of the legal costs the couple incurred during the 14-month long legal battle

The adoptive parents of a seriously-disabled child have won £14,000 in legal costs after a year-long battle with the local council over care for their son.

The five-year-old, known only as 'K' for legal reasons, was diagnosed with learning difficulties and severe mental health issues after being placed with the couple in 2011. 

A dispute broke out between the couple, referred to as NP and SP, and Essex County Council over who should pay for the preparation of a care plan to meet the complex need of the young boy.

Judge Lynn Roberts, sitting at Chelmsford Family Court, ruled last month that Essex must pay a large proportion of the legal costs the couple incurred during the 14-month long legal battle.

Lawyers for the couple warned that if other local authorities were to act like Essex, it will become 'impossible' for 'hard to place children' like child K to find homes with loving families.

In the written judgement released today, Judge Lynn Roberts said that at the time K was placed with the couple, aged 22 months, 'the extent of his difficulties had not been understood'.

It meant the couple found themselves 'parenting a child with an array of problems' without any support as Essex had not identified the child's difficulties - or the assistance they would require.

Despite these challenges, the judge said, the proposed adopters are 'devoted' to the boy and he is 'very much part of their family'.

They filed their application to adopt K in July 2013. By this point, the couple claim they had raised issues about the levels of support they needed for several months. 

This was done in light of the adoptive mother's health deteriorating, said Judge Roberts.

Local authority officials made it clear Essex would not pay for any assessment of K's complex needs - required to draw up a care plan - and expected them 'to sort out the issues with the social workers'.

The court ordered the council to carry out an assessment and put together a proposed care plan but delays and missed deadlines meant an agreement was not reached until November 2014. 

During this time, the council also failed to address the particular needs of K until it received a report from children's charity Barnardos.

Judge Roberts said the proposed adopters argued that, without expert legal advice and representation, they would not have achieved the support plan they now had and which is vital for K.

August 2011 - Child K, then aged 22 months, is placed with prospective adoptive parents.

July 2013 - The couple filed to adopt. They claim that by this point they had been raising issues about the support the boy required for several months.

8 November 2013 - Court orders the council to produce a report and assessment, to include the extent of the child’s complex needs and the services which are to be offered. Prior to this, the Council made it clear they expected the couple to 'sort out the issues with the social workers'. Later that day, the Council submitted a care plan, saying 'it was not a draft'. 

20 December 2013 - Further order made about obtaining further medical records for K.

January 2014 - Council misses deadline to produce report and assessment, including care services to be offered.

February 2014 - Council misses deadline to produce medical records. Hearing was put off until June.

Mid-September 2014 - Solicitors for the couple chase the council for new report and support plan after it was not submitted in August. 

30 September 2014 - Solicitors wrote about the Local Authority meeting the proposed adopters costs, but this was not agreed.

5 November 2014 - Local Authority filed yet another support plan. This support plan did not in fact say what the social worker had indicated it would say. 

14 November 2014 - Another support plan emerged which was acceptable to the couple with a couple of minor amendments.

18 November 2014 - They applied for an Order that the Local Authority pay their costs.

25 November 2014 - Judge heard submissions in relation to the costs incurred by the prospective adopters in their adoption of K.

12 December 2014 - Judge orders local authority to pay £14,000 in costs. 

Today - Written judgement released 

The county council argued it should not have to pay the couple's costs bill and contended it had been 'generous' to the family in terms of funding - particularly regarding the final support plan.

The judge concluded that without the proposed adopters' expert legal advice, 'either the placement would have broken down because the appropriate support was not in place, or the adoption would have gone ahead but without the support which all now agree is necessary, which would have meant K and his parents would continue to struggle.'

The judge said there had been 'great delay', and it appeared the local authority was slow to recognise the extent of K's difficulties and the demands his care was making on NP and SP.

The couple sought just over £17,000 in legal fees, but the judge ruled they were entitled to £14,000. 

She said this reflected the fact that NP and SP had been successful in securing the right support plan necessary to make an adoption order possible.

It also reflected fact that the county council 'were unreasonable and delayed and did not comply with orders of the court'. 

Commenting on the ruling, Nigel Priestley, representing the couple, said: 'Many people must wonder - "Why did it take so long?" Less committed couples would have thrown in the towel years ago.'

Mr Priestly added: 'The Government want more adoptions. They want to see hard to place children finding homes in loving families.

'If other local authorities act like Essex it will be impossible for this key policy to succeed. Why should adopters have to fight for support and risk their own money in this way?

'There is no legal aid for contests over support plans. The costs in this case ran to five figures before Essex were told to pay.

'The local authority knew that they would have to find a specialist foster placement or residential home for K if this placement failed. Essex attitude was inexplicable':

NP said the council's approach was 'a disgrace' and the local authority 'fought us all the way'. 

He added: 'Essex didn't understand how the pressure from K's behaviour was building and (my wife) became seriously ill. 

'We realised we needed legal representation. An inadequate support plan was prepared.

'We tried to negotiate changes to the plan. Social services and the independent reviewing officer said that this was the final version. There could be no additional support.

'We are delighted by the judge's decision to make Essex pay towards our costs.'

Judge Roberts said she had made the final adoption order on the day she considered the issue of costs.
