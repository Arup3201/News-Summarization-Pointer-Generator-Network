Children's faces pressed against glass. Young boys and girls sleeping under blankets wall-to-wall on concrete floors. The pungent odor that comes with keeping travelers in close quarters.

These were the sights from a Wednesday tour of a crowded Border Patrol station in south Texas where thousands of immigrants are being held before they are transferred to shelters across the U.S.

It was the first time the media was given access to the facility since President Obama called the more than 47,000 unaccompanied children who have entered the country illegally this budget year an 'urgent humanitarian situation'.

Overcrowded: Children sleep under red cross blankets on the floor of a Border Patrol center in Texas

Overwhelmed: Children, many from Central America, color pictures at the center. Border Patrol stations have been overrun with immigrant children in the past year

Border Patrol stations like the one in Brownsville were not meant for long-term custody. Immigrants are supposed to wait there until they are processed and taken to detention centers.

But the surge in children arriving without their parents has overwhelmed the government.

The surge, which has been building for three years, comes amid a steep overall increase in immigrant arrests in southernmost Texas.

The children are mostly from Central America. They pose a particular challenge because the law requires Customs and Border Protection to transfer them to the Department of Health and Human Services within 72 hours.

That agency's network of about 100 shelters around the country has been over capacity for months and is now caring for more than 7,600 children.Â 

Waiting: Illegal immigrant children are held in Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma being moved to shelters

Contact: An officer helps boys make phone calls as they try to reach relatives who could take over their care

Laundry room: Piles of clean clothes and towels are stacked up for the immigrants close to the showering area

Children began backing up in already overcrowded Border Patrol stations. Eventually, the Border Patrol began flying them to Arizona, where it set up a processing center.

From there, they are sent to private shelters or temporary housing at barracks on military bases in California, Texas and Oklahoma.

But the children who were at Fort Brown on Wednesday remain in the custody of an agency ill-equipped to care for them.

Dozens of young boys were divided from dozens of young girls. Mothers with children still younger were in another cell.

Happier faces could be found in a side yard just outside the station. There, young children colored pictures under a camouflage tent.

Caring: Two boys are helped to pick out clothing after arriving at a border placement center in Arizona

Supplies: Stacks of boxes full of children's clothes are at the Border Patrol station, where thousands of youngsters are being held

Waiting: Those staying at the overcrowded center will be transferred to cities across the U.S.

A group of about a dozen girls of perhaps 5 or 6 sat under another tent outside the shower trailer, dark hair wet and shiny. Women wearing blue gloves combed each girl's hair. Tables held stacks of clean jeans, T-shirts and toiletries.

Deeper into the yard, teen girls kicked a soccer ball with workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

Between October and May, 162,000 people from countries 'other than Mexico' have entered the U.S. across the southern border, Fox News reported.

Among them were 47,017 unaccompanied children, sent by family in Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador or Nicaragua to join relatives already in the U.S.

Most of the children are turning themselves in to U.S. Border Patrol agents, who transport them to a facility where they are given 'notices to appear' before an immigration judge between 10 and 90 days later.

HHS takes over after that, drawing on a $1 billion budget to house, feed and otherwise care for the children until a suitable adult family member can be located to claim them.

Packed in: The surge in numbers of unaccompanied children arriving has put pressure on the centers

HHS, which houses them until family members can be found, has begun releasing illegal immigrant children 'by the hundreds' into the custody of adults who are illegal immigrants themselves, an HHS official familiar with the situation on America's southern border told MailOnline late on Tuesday.

An official spokesman for HHS's Administration for Children and Families confirmed on Wednesday that the agency has no system in place to verify whether the adults are here legally.

Kenneth Wolfe told MailOnline that 'around 90 percent of the minors in the UAC program are released to verified sponsors (mostly family members) in the U.S.'

Asked if 'verified' means that the adults' immigration status has been checked, he responded, 'No.'He also answered 'no' when asked if there is 'an effort made to ascertain the immigration status of the adults who claim the kids.'

Resources: Staff try to keep the children clean and clothed as they go through the immigration processing centers

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took issue with what appears to be an unprecedented immigration policy-in-the-making on Tuesday night during a town hall broadcast on CNN.

'They should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are,' Clinton said of the children.

She told question-and-answer moderator Christiane Amanpour that 'all of them that can be should be reunited with their families' in their home countries.

'We have to send a clear message,' Clinton said: 'Just because your child gets across the border, that doesn't mean the child gets to stay.'
