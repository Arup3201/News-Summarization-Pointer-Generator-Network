The perfect wine as voted for by UK wine-lovers would be red, produced in Australia, and cost just £5.83.

The ideal bottle for convenience-led Britons would also feature a screw top and be on offer at a discounted price or as part of a multi-buy promotion.

The characteristics of the perfect tipple are unearthed thanks to new research into British beverage-buying habits.

Almost 40 per cent prefer a glass of rouge, compared to 35 per cent who would choose white

British vino drinkers would also want their beverage available to buy at the supermarket, and to be made by a popular, known brand.

Red wine narrowly beat white as the nation's favourite, with almost 40 per cent preferring a glass of rouge, compared to the 35 per cent who chose white.

Rosé ranked in third place after drawing less than a fifth of the vote (19 per cent). 

While European wine from heavyweight producer countries like France, Spain and Italy remained well liked, New World wine - especially that from Australia - was revealed to be leagues ahead in the popularity stakes, with 1 in 5 declaring a preference for booze from down under.

When it comes to splashing the cash (or not), UK shoppers are prepared to pay, on average, £5.83 for a bottle, with 7 in 10 unwilling to spend more than £6.

We're also much more likely to buy a wine if it's on offer or discounted as more than half of respondents stated that ‘getting a bargain' is a main purchasing driver.

These latest statistics produced by specialist wine bottler Cobevco paint a picture of us Britons as creatures of habit.

Almost half choose to buy a particular wine because it's made by a brand they've heard of or because it's a grape variety we've tried before and like.

Despite this, more than 1 in 3 claim to be ‘knowledgeable' and ‘adventurous' when it comes to wine.

Almost 80 per cent of us buy our bottles
 exclusively at the supermarket, preferring the convenience of having 
everything in the same place to the specialist knowledge of wine 
merchants.

Only 6 per cent purchase wine at an off license, while even fewer (3 per cent) shop for the booze online.

A Cobevco spokesperson said: 'The results of this research really do give us an insight into the state of the nation when it comes to wine preferences.

'For the first time, we're able to get the low down on what makes British consumers tick in the wine aisle.

'While public confidence and spending is on the up, shoppers' purse strings are still tight so it's no surprise that they're looking for an affordable treat in the form of a bargain bottle - most likely one that's on offer.

'What's interesting is that shoppers are now demanding great value wine from far flung producer countries.

'As supply chain technologies advance and overseas producers begin to embrace the cost benefits of bottling in the UK, we'll begin to see even more top notch yet affordable New World wine hit our shelves.'
