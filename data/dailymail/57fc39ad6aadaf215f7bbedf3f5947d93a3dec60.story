Break-in: Leanne Zaloumis, 30, pictured leaving Isleworth Crown Court, avoided jail despite forcing herself into Simon Cowell's home

A stalker who broke into the home of music mogul Simon Cowell and hid on a shelf in his giant wardrobe holding a brick avoided jail today.

Leanne Zaloumis was given a 12-month community order as well as a restraining order today after getting into his mansion while the X-Factor creator watched TV in his bedroom four months ago.

Judge Robert Winstanley at Isleworth Crown Court, west London, also said that the order would have a mental health care requirement.

Zaloumis, of Catford, south-east London, had admitted being in possession of a brick with the intent to damage or destroy property, and breaking a window at the Holland Park address.

Cowell, 52, was watching TV in his bedroom when he heard a 'loud bang' coming from his bathroom on March 24 and called his staff.

Zaloumis was taken to Notting Hill police station after being found inside the property.

At a previous hearing, she was told she must stay at her home address, remain inside between 7pm and 7am and wear an electronic tag.

She was also told by Judge John Dennis on that occasion that the 102 days she spent in custody was 'sufficient punishment'.

Cowell who was not present at today’s hearing, saw that Zaloumis was standing outside his shattered bathroom window, screaming as she held a brick above her head, her hands covered in blood.

Scotland Yard was called, who sent a squad of armed officers to rescue him as Zaloumis continued to shout, repeatedly slamming the glass with the brick.

After a lengthy search of the grounds, police found the intruder hiding on a shelf 7ft up in a walk-in wardrobe next to the star’s bedroom, where the walls had been smeared with blood.

Police drew their weapons and asked her to get down, but Zaloumis struggled with officers, screaming: ‘Listen to me, someone is trapped in here.’

The defendant told police: ‘Simon knows me. I didn’t break in, I was already in the house.’

She claimed the star had stalked her via Twitter.

She also admitted researching his address on her computer and making a previous visit to his home six months earlier when she believed he was away in America, even though her family has claimed that she isn’t a fan.
