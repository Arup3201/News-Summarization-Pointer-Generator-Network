Mikel Arteta has backed  Hector Bellerin to build on his first team appearances and make the right back position his own.

Bellerin, 19, made his debut against Dortmund last week and also started against Southampton in the Capital One Cup on Tuesday night.

And Arteta says he has been watching his Spaniard compatriot for some time and believes he has what it takes to be a success in north London.

Hector Bellerin has been tipped for a fine future at Arsenal after impressing early on

Club captain Mikel Arteta says he thinks Bellerin is already a 'top player'

'I think he's a top player,' Arteta told Arsenal's official matchday programme.

'He can be the right back of Arsenal for many years in my opinion, provided he gets the chance. Mentally, he handles what is requested to play at the highest level. He's got pace, he's got technique, and he's a very positive guy.

'I talk to Hector a lot. He's been around for years and we've been talking to each other for a long time. I know him well because he's taken part in pre-season a few times with us already.

'He's a very confident guy and we treat him as any other player because he's part of our squad. Hopefully he's going to become a top player at the club.'

Bellerin is currently the club's second choice right back, with Calum Chambers deputising for the injured Mathieu Debuchy.
