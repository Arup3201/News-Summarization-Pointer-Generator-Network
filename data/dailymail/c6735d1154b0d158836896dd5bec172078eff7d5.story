Daniel Sturridge was 23 years old when the proverbial penny dropped and, in turn, balls started landing in the back of the net.

It took a big-money transfer to new surroundings to trigger his devastating improvement.

Similarly, Danny Welbeck is 23 years old and has just completed a £16million move from Manchester United to Arsenal.

On Monday night he scored both goals for England in a 2-0 victory in Switzerland.

Easy does it: Danny Welbeck netted both goals in England's 2-0 win over Switzerland 

Neat finish: Welbeck flourished playing through the middle rather than on the wing

Sometimes footballers need a change, something different to think about, a new environment to spark an upturn in fortune.

It worked for Sturridge, now 25. He has 36 goals from 52 outings since swapping Chelsea for Liverpool.

So is Welbeck ready to enjoy a goals glut of his own in North London?

His CV, of course, would suggest not; 37 from 178 during the course of his club career equates to one every five games or so.

Team player: Welbeck often sacrificed himself for the good of the team at Manchester United 

Club class: Welbeck completed his move from United to Arsenal on transfer deadline day

But goalscorers need to be treated as such, deployed in a central domain with chances carved for their benefit.

Welbeck, at Old Trafford, spent more time on the wing than he did in the penalty box, something which irked the player himself.

Ironically, it was an injury to Sturridge which presented him with his chance in Basle. He responded with a brace, the first poached from six yards and the second a cool finish from 12. You don’t score those sorts of goals from the touchline.

At Arsenal he will be used as a centre forward. Chances will be fashioned. Welbeck will have no excuse.

This weekend the Gunners face Manchester City, what better setting for the new boy to prove his worth?

For ultimately all strikers are judged on the goals they return. Forget Welbeck the team player, the player who sacrificed himself manning a flank for United. It is time for Welbeck to demonstrate a selfish streak, to make himself a certain starter for club and country.

Just the beginning: Welbeck can use his move to Arsenal to kick on and flourish for club and country 

His progress will be monitored with trepidation from the North West. For Welbeck was one of their own, an academy graduate whose potential will now be realised at a top-flight rival.

Manchester City – the club who nurtured Sturridge - know the feeling.

Don’t forget that Welbeck is still only 23. His double on Monday took his Three Lions tally to 10. At the same age, Gary Lineker had one cap and no goals. Sturridge, similarly, has only flourished in the past 18 months.

For Welbeck, Arsenal and England, then, this is only the beginning.

Welbeck can take inspiration from Daniel Sturridge following his move from Chelsea to Liverpool in 2013 and kick on and become a better player
