A survey from the U.S. Census Bureau has identified the only cities in America where women make more money than their male counterparts.

The American Community survey discovered that women have the upper hand in only 16 cities and found just how much more, on average, they make than men in each.

If the findings suggest just one thing, it's that California appears to be the state friendliest toward women.

Equal pay? The U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey recently found that women make more than men in just 16 American cities

Surprised? Of the 16 cities where the survey found women make more than men, they fare the best against men in Jacksonville, North Carolina. Women in the coastal city make on average 127.12 percent of what men make

Of the 16 cities listed, shown here in a chart by Nerd Wallet, six of them are in California: Indio, Inglewood, Richmond, Whittier, Hesperia and Vallejo.

But the top city, where women fare the best against men was elsewhere--in Jacksonville, North Carolina.

The only state other than California that appears on the list more than once is New York, whose cities of Mount Vernon and Syracuse made the cut.

One striking thing about the list is the size of the cities on it, the biggest of which tops out at around 150,000.

Golden State: Inglewood, California is one of 6 cities in the Golden State on the list. The only other state that appears on the list more than once is New York, where two of the listed cities are located
