The FA have launched an investigation after the kick-off for Chelsea’s Premier League clash with Arsenal was delayed by 15 minutes on Sunday when a smoke bomb went off on a stadium concourse at Stamford Bridge.

Both clubs were contacted for their observations on Monday although Arsenal are more likely to be in trouble because the incident occurred at the away end of the ground. 

Gates were temporarily closed to prevent more of their supporters entering the stadium and a match scheduled to start at 2.05pm did not kick off until 2.20pm.

Although it was initially reported that flares had been set off, it now appears to have been a smoke bomb.

Arsenal could be charged under rule E20 for ‘failing to control supporters’ but it is far from certain that they will face further action.

The Premier League have also been in touch with both clubs as part of their ongoing efforts to keep flares and smoke bombs out of football grounds.
