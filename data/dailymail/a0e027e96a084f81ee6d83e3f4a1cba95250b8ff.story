Beleaguered New Jersey Governor Chris Christie just gained a brand new headache Monday when it was revealed a state trooper from his security detail was arrested last month for shoplifting, among other things, gun accessories.

Trooper William Carvounis, 35, of North Brunswick, was at a Cabela's sporting goods store on January 8 when he put several items in his cargo pants pockets — including some handgun grips, and a pistol magazine among other items — according to Tilden police.

Surveillance footage allegedly reveals Carvounis even tried to walk out of the store wearing a stolen hat, the same one he wore while begging police not to arrest him 'out of professional courtesy.'

Gone fishin': A member of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's security detail was arrested January 8 on shoplifting charges, it was revealed Monday. Trooper William Carvounis allegedly pocketed nearly $300 in merchandise including gun accessories at a Pennsylvania Cabela's sporting goods store

While Carvounis paid for some items at checkout, he allegedly did not pay for the concealed items, which were worth $267.38.

Tilden Township Chief William McEllroy confirmed the arrest first reported by NewJersey.Watchdog.org, a news website run by an investigative reporter.

Bad timing: The revelation could become yet another thorn in the beleaguered governor's side. Trooper Carvoulis was suspended from duty by the New Jersey State Police as soon as they learned of his arrest

The Watchdog also confirmed that Carvounis is a State Trooper who is part of the governor's security detail.

'Carvounis said he was on the governor’s security detail,' McEllroy said. 'He said he makes $140,000 a year, and he’s afraid of losing his job.'

'We don’t give preferential treatment when someone breaks the law,' replied McEllroy.

Carvounis didn't explicitly ask for the break because of his position on the governor's detail; it was 'more or less one cop asking another cop for a break multiple times,' McEllroy said.

The trooper's attorney, Charles Sciarra, said his client denies he sought special treatment and the underlying shoplifting charges.

He said a police report and the criminal complaint don't mention the trooper asking for a break.

'The initial reports we have don't indicate anything about such a request,' said Sciarra. 'With that said, my client made purchases that day and denies any allegation of any shoplifting. And quite frankly, we see no connection between what's occurred in the store in Pennsylvania and his duties for the New Jersey State Police.'

Sciarra confirmed that Carvounis has been suspended from his job. He said 'his suspension paperwork from the state police does not mention anything about asking for a courtesy and abusing his position.'

Carvounis is charged with two counts of retail theft, online court records show. One is a first-degree misdemeanor that can carry up to five years' in prison, and the other a summary offense, which is similar to a traffic ticket.

The trooper remained free on bond Monday, and court records show he has waived his right to a preliminary hearing, meaning the charges must be disposed of at a trial or through a plea in Berks County Common Pleas Court.
