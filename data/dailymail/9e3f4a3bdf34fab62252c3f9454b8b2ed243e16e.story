Brazil secretly helped supply weapons to Argentina during the Falklands War, it was revealed today.

Brazil was officially neutral in the 1982 conflict, which began 20 years ago this month when Argentine forces occupied the islands.

But secret Brazilian government documents revealed today that Argentina's South American neighbour provided logistical support for the supply of arms for use against British forces - and even bought bombs and ammunition for Argentina's military junta.

A document from Brazil's National Security Council, unearthed by the O Globo newpaper, reported that Argentina regularly contacted the Brazilian government with requests for help in the war effort.

They included buying aeroplanes, incendiary bombs, ammunition for rifles, radar systems and aviation fuel.

Brazil also allowed planes belonging to Argentina's national airline, Aerolineas Argentinas, but which were secretly carrying weapons from Libya and Cuba, to refuel at the country's airports.

At one point Recife aiport in the northwest of Brazil was receiving two flights a day from Libya en route to Buenos Aires, packed with ammunition and explosives, according to another document from the Brazilian Navy.

The supply of arms also departed from Israel with stopovers in the Canary Islands and Rio de Janeiro. Planes from Cuba - Brazil's enemy during the Cold War - were also allowed to pass through Brazilian airspace, loaded with guns, the document also reveals.

When confronted about its clandestine support for its neighbour, however, Brazil flatly denied the charge.

A
 previously unseen letter from the British Embassy in Brazil was also 
uncovered, accusing Brazil of allowing the landing of an Argentinian 
plan loaded with weapons.

In
 response the Brazilian government said that in their inspection of the 
Aerolineas Argentinas flight they 'didn't find anything of a military 
nature.'

Despite its claims to being officially neutral, Brazil is thought to have long supported Argentina in the territorial conflict.

Both countries refer to the disputed islands as the 'Malvinas', with Brazil backing Argentina in the sovereignty dispute in 2010.

The Brazilian government also stated that the UK's offshore oil exploration programme in the Argentinan continental shelf was 'illegal' and 'inconsistent with what determines the United Nations'.

The reported 
revelations about Brazil's support of Argentina may not come as a 
surprise to many, given Brazil's stance when the Falklands dispute 
erupted again earlier this year.

In January Brazil took sides against Britain by refusing permission for a Royal navy ship to dock in Rio de Janeiro.

HMS
 Clyde, which patrols the waters around the Falklands, was forced to 
switch course to Chile after being rebuffed by the Brazilians.

Foreign
 policy analysts claimed the new Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff was 
trying to play the ‘anti-colonial card’ to satisfy the left-wing 
factions of her Worker’s Party.
