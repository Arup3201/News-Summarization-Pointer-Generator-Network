The mother of the baby murdered by a nurse in 1982 has made a desperate plea to find more victims so her daughter's killer will not be released from prison after serving just one third of her sentence.

Petti McClellan's daughter Chelsea was just 15-months-old when she was repeatedly injected with a lethal substance by Genene Anne Jones - who was later sentenced to 99 years in prison for the murder.

It is believed Jones killed as many as 46 babies under her care at Bexar County Hospital while she worked there from 1977 - 1982.

If she gets out, she will have served less than one year for every infant death she is suspected of being involved in.

Petti McClellan said: 'I need to find someone else, another family that was a victim of Genene Jones. That's the only way to keep this woman in prison. This is my mission now'

Victim: Jones was sentenced to 99 years in prison for the 1982 murder of 15-month-old Chelsea McClellan who died under her care at Bexar County Hospital

Petti is making it her mission to 
find a family whose baby may have been taken away from them at the hands
of Jones so she can keep her in prison forever.

The 63-year-old could be released as soon as 2018 under an expired Texas law that grants a 'mandatory release' to inmates with good behavior.

If Petti has her way she will remain behind bars, but the shocking news of her early release has forced her to relive the day her daughter died.

Nurse: Genene Jones was convicted of murdering 15-month-old Chelsea McClellan in 1984

'Jones was working at a new pediatric clinic in Kerrville,' she told ABCNews.com. 'I remember being so excited to have a neighborhood 
pediatrician that I could take Chelsea and my son Cameron to.

'Cameron was about three-years-old when he got the flu so I took him into 
the clinic, and I brought Chelsea with me.

'As we 
sat in the waiting room, Genene said she would update Chelsea's shots.

'I took Chelsea and followed Genene into the examining room. I noticed 
that the syringes were already fixed.

'I was holding Chelsea, she was 
facing me, and Jones gave her the first shot in her left thigh. 
Immediately Chelsea had trouble breathing. She tried to say my name and couldn't.'

Before she could stop her, Jones gave baby Chelsea a second shot in her right leg. That's when she stopped breathing.

'Genene had this wild look in her eyes, like she was on a high,' Petti recalls. 'She got
really excited, and she yelled that Chelsea was not breathing. She 
grabbed her from me and put her on a table. She told me to go get 
the doctor.'

By the time an ambulance came to the clinic, a doctor had stabilized Chelsea and she was breathing on her own.

Doctors wanted to transfer the toddler
to a bigger hospital in San Antonio where she could be monitored. Petti
followed in her car while Jones was riding in the ambulance with two 
EMTs.

Her baby died during that ride after Jones again injected her with succinylcholine chloride, claiming she was having a seizure.

The EMTs testified in her murder trial that Chelsea's vitals were fine.

Medical facility: Jones is suspected of murdering up to 46 babies while she was a nurse at Bexar County Hospital - now The University Hospital of San Antonio - from 1978 - 1982

Talking about the death of her 
daughter, Petti told ABC: 'It was a real mother's terror. I was a mess, I
just fell apart. I don't remember much from that moment.'

Her mission now, she says, is finding
another family whose baby was a victim of Jones' so that she will stay in 
prison until the end of her days.

'I need to find someone else, another family that was a victim of Genene
Jones. That's the only way to keep this woman in prison. Who knows what
she can do if she gets out.

'This is my mission now. Losing a child does not consume you, it drives you,' she said.

The 63-year-old is currently being held in the Carole S. Young Medical Facility, a correctional center in Dickinson, Texas.

A Facebook group called 'Victims of Genene Anne Jones' has been set up and currently has 60 members.

Joann Garza, the group's administrator, had a twin brother her family believes was killed by Jones.

Baby Joel was taken to Bexar County Hospital after he choked on his bottle and, according to Garza, was given shots by Jones along with two unidentified twin girls. All three children died.
