Toulon coach Bernard Laporte insisted Steffon Armitage’s proposed move to Bath is finished after picking him for Sunday’s opening European tie.

But while the Frenchman was adamant he would not let his highly talented back-row return to England to further his World Cup ambitions, he conceded that the club’s bosses could still do a deal behind his back.

If Armitage does play against Scarlets in the European Champions Cup on Sunday, he will be cup-tied for the rest of the competition and Bath would walk away.

Laporte said: ‘I am not exactly sure where this story about Steffon really started but for me in sporting terms it is over, finished.

‘I have spoken to Steffon and he knows the situation. He will start at No 8 for us on Sunday. That is my decision. As for what the club presidents are doing, I do not know. That is their business. My business is to make Toulon win.’

Armitage, 29, has been in talks with Bath for the past week about a deal which would allow to play in next year’s World Cup, but the West Country club are loath to pay the reported £240,000 transfer fee to release him from the last two years of his contract.

With talks stalling, and the RFU apparently unwilling to upset other Aviva Premiership clubs or undermine the competition by providing financial support to Bath, Toulon on Thursday maintained a hard-line stance.

Toulon owner Mourad Boudjellal drives a notoriously hard bargain and could be playing a game of brinkmanship in an attempt to squeeze as much commercial capital out of the deal as possible.

So, while Laporte is understandably keen to retain a player who has excelled for the defending European champions over the past two seasons, the decision may be taken out of his hands.

RFU rules, introduced to dissuade English-qualified players from signing lucrative contracts in France which would weaken the Premiership, mean only players playing in England can be selected for the national side except in exceptional circumstances. And with next year’s World Cup looming, Armitage is desperate to be involved.

‘Of course, I know what the World Cup means for players,’ Laporte added. ‘If you have to go, you go. That is what I spoke with Stuart (Lancaster) about on Wednesday. I wanted to know precisely what the situation was. In fact, it is nothing to do with Stuart. The policy of the English union is exact. You have to be in England to play for the national team.’

Bath’s back-row injury crisis has left Carl Fearns, Francois Louw, Matt Garvey and Alafoti Fa’osiliva all sidelined, while Leroy Houston is suspended.

Complicating matters further are Armitage’s expected wage demands. He is currently on a deal worth more than £300,000 at Toulon and, with Bath already close to the Premiership’s salary cap, it is unclear how they would accommodate him within budget.

With this Sunday’s clash with Scarlets appearing to be D-Day for the proposed deal, it looks increasingly unlikely they need to worry about that.
