Trained sharpshooters may
soon be a thing of the past after a gun that aims itself was unveiled during last week’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.

TrackingPoint, an Austin,
Texas-based gun manufacturer took the wraps off a semi-automatic gun with five times the
accuracy of most experienced shooters.

The nearly-$10,000 500
Series AR Smart Rifle tags targets within a 500-yard range and automatically
shoots them - even if they're moving as fast as 10 miles per hour, according to
NBC News.

No need for any experience: Just tag the target and let the 500 Series AR Smart Rifle do all the work

‘There are some amazing
expert marksmen in the world,’TrackingPoint CEO John Lupher told Digital
Trends. ‘But what this does is, it lets you pick up this gun and go shoot right
to the same level of those expert marksmen.’

Mr Lupher also boasted the
gun is ‘beyond what the human capacity is for being able to factor’ the exact
spot to hit moving targets and fire off a shot.

The 500 Series AR is not the
first self-aiming gun built by the company, nor is it the longest range firearm
– but it is the only semi-automatic self-aiming firearm known to exist.

TrackingPoint also makes a
self-aiming rifle with a range of up to 1,200 yards and a self-aiming handgun,
DigitalTrends noted.

Those guns were first rolled
out last year, according to NBC News.

All of the firearms use the
company’s TTX system – which tracks Range, drop, magnus effect, spindrift,
coriolis effect, direction, cant, inclination, pressure, temperature, humidity,
muzzle velocity, barrel length and twist, lock time, ballistic coefficient, and
drag coefficient, according to DigitalTrends.

Wind direction and speed are
also tracked, but those must be input manually, the site noted.

Even more amazingly, the AR
Series allows users to connect to a smartphone running the TrackingPoint app
and record up to an hour of video that can be stored in the gun’s on-board
storage, according to Digital Trends.

People can pre-order the
guns through the company’s website, but must pass more than a background check
– they must also be willing to be beta testers of sorts. The company wants a
continuous stream of data about the devices to help make them even more
accurate.

The firm is also working on
developing a model for the military and licenses technology to Remington,
according to NBC News.

About 40 people have so far
qualified, according to NBC News. Guns should start shipping in October.
