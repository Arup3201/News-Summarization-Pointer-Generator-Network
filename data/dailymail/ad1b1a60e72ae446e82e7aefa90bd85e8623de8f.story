It sounds like a dessert, is as small as a credit card, and could inspire the next Mark Zuckerberg.

The creators of the £22 Raspberry Pi computer, which launched yesterday, hope it will encourage children to design their own apps.

But the first task for the next generation of Zuckerbergs and Bill Gateses could be to build a new website for the product, after the current page crashed under the weight of demand.

The tiny £22 Raspberry Pi computer includes a wi-fi connection to access the internet, can connect to other gadgets such as cameras, and is even capable of running basic 3D games

The gadget looks rather odd next to 
sleek modern offerings such as the iPad, and appears to have more in 
common with the crystal radio sets of the 1950s.

However, the machine is a 
fully-fledged computer and can be connected to a monitor, keyboard and 
mouse, as well as speakers and printers.

Robert Mullins, co-founder of the 
Cambridge-based Raspberry Pi Foundation, said: ‘The primary goal was to 
build a low-cost computer that every child could own, and one where 
programming was the natural thing to do with it.’

The launch follows criticism of technology teaching in the UK.

Typically, this has focused on how to use a computer, rather than how to create hardware or software.

Last August the chairman of Google, 
Eric Schmidt, said the lack of proper computer science lessons in 
schools was hindering Britain’s chances of success in the ‘digital media
 economy’.

His call for the UK to reignite 
children’s passion for science, engineering and maths was seized upon by
 Education Secretary Michael  Gove, who wants computer teaching to place
 greater emphasis on skills such as programming. In a recent speech, Mr 
Gove said ‘initiatives like the Raspberry Pi scheme will give children 
the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of programming’.

He added that the gadget was ‘a great example of the cutting edge of education technology happening right here in the UK’.

Another of the Pi’s creators, Eben 
Upton, said academics and technology experts decided to pursue the 
project after seeing the number of computer science students fall.

‘It has been six years in the making,’
 he said. ‘The number of things that had to go right for this to happen 
is enormous. I couldn’t be more pleased.’

In the long term, Dr Upton hopes the device will help create an additional 1,000 computer engineers in the UK each year.

The foundation had intended to build 
the device in Britain. However, after finding that it would not be able 
to do this and keep the price at £22, it opted to use factories in 
China.

The organisation has formed a 
partnership with two UK distributors, Premier Farnell and RS Components,
 which should be able to increase production quickly to meet demand.

Dr Upton said the popularity of the Pi
 – and the resulting pressure on its website – were positive signs. ‘We 
didn’t realise how successful this was going to be,’ he said. ‘Now we 
can concentrate on teaching people to program.’
