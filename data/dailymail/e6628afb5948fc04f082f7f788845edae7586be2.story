Three men have died as police warn of a batch of ecstasy described as red, triangular pills with a Superman logo printed on them (pictured)

Three men have died and another was fighting for his life last night after taking drugs from a suspected rogue batch of ecstasy embossed with the Superman logo.

Two New Year revellers lost their lives within hours of each other yesterday after swallowing the angular red pills stamped with the superhero’s ‘S’ symbol.

Another man who is believed to have taken the same type of pill collapsed and died on Christmas Eve.

A fourth man was last night in hospital in a critical condition.

After the incidents – which all occurred in or near Ipswich – detectives appealed for clubbers who still had any of the tablets to hand them in.

Police also asked for help to identify the dealer selling the drug.Chief Inspector Steve Denham said: ‘Taking drugs is linked to a great deal of harm and risk and it is not uncommon for people to suffer injury and even death from taking them.

‘But it’s pretty unusual to have so many tragic incidents in such a short space of time.’

Emergency services were called to a semi-detached house in Rendlesham, Suffolk, at 7.10am yesterday.

Paramedics treated a seriously ill man but he died at the two-bedroom property on a new-build estate.

Neighbours said a young couple in their 20s moved into the rented house around three months ago. 

A man was pronounced dead at a home in Chestnut Close in Rendlesham. The home involved was on the left hand side of the semi-detached property

Police believe the men, who were all in their twenties, may have been involved with the drug after emergency services were called to three addresses across Ipswich in the space of one week

A resident, who asked not to be named, described seeing an ambulance and a police car outside the property.

‘They were coming and going in and out of the house,’ he said. 

‘It is all very sad. Normally this close is very quiet. There are a lot of semi-retired people here.’ 

In a second 999 call yesterday at 9.40am, emergency staff were told that a man was ill in a ground-floor flat in Ipswich on another new-build estate.

He died at the two-bedroom property despite the efforts of paramedics. An air ambulance flew to the scene and a second man was taken to hospital, where he remained last night.

Neighbours said an Eastern European man believed to be the boyfriend of the woman living there had moved in about six months ago.

Ecstasy is considered pure when made with a strong concentration of the chemical MDMA. 

PMA, or PMMA, has a similar effect, but is much more poisonous. 

The effects of PMA, which include heightened intensity of emotions and alertness, take longer to set in than those of MDMA. 

As such drug-takers are more likely to double their dosage under the mistaken impression the substance is having no effect on them. 

According to Frank, a drug counselling organisation, a quarter of a tablet containing PMA is enough to kill. 

It can cause body temperatures to soar to fatal levels, bring on muscle spasms and sees blood pressure increase.  

No one was at the flat last night. A neighbour said: ‘I looked out of my window at about 10am and saw two ambulances and a paramedic car along with a police car.

‘The air ambulance landed behind the flats. The young lady who lives in the flat came out in a distraught state.

‘She sat in a police car with an officer and then some friends came to pick her up. It is just such an awful tragedy.’

The man who died on Christmas Eve was also from Ipswich. Emergency services were called to his address at around 5.30pm.

A spokesman for the East of England Ambulance Service said the two men who died yesterday both suffered cardiac arrests. 

Similar shaped pills have been sold in the Netherlands where the authorities said they had a ‘very high dose of the dangerous substance PMA’.

The effects are delayed, leading many users to assume the pills are weak and take more.

Life-threatening symptoms can occur hours later, including increased heart rate and very high body temperature.

The charity DrugScope warned there had been an increase in ecstasy-related deaths in the past five years.

A spokesman said: ‘You can’t tell the dosage or content of a pill just by looking at it.’ 

In 2013 a batch of ecstasy pills with a Rolex symbol emblazoned on them circulated around Scotland. They were found to contain a lethal dosage of PMA, with several club-goers dying after taking the drug
