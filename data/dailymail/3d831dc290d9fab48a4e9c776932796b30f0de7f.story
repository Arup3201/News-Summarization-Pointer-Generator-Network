Tesco has unveiled a bespoke car covered entirely with everyday supermarket items to mark the launch of its Clubcard Fuel Save.

The car, adorned with groceries, clothing and homeware products, including baguettes, bunches of bananas and biscuits - with a wheel of Camembert acting as its petrol cap - went on its maiden voyage today, driven by customer Jane Jeffrey.

The car is currently making its way around the country, stopping off in Bristol this afternoon and then travelling up to Manchester and Birmingham tomorrow.

The car, adorned entirely with Tesco groceries, was launched as part of Clubcard Fuel Save

Running on empty: research shows that high fuel prices mean Britain have to cut down on food

The car is made almost entirely out of 
Tesco stock including desk lamps as wind mirrors, floor mops as 
windscreen wipers, pizza tray and cutlery as hub caps, mixing bowls as 
headlights, spatula as an aerial, and passenger seats from kitchen 
chairs and duvets, which are sure to make for a comfy ride.

Animator, director and writer - and Tim 
Burton collaborator - Anthony Farquhar-Smith is the man behind the 
design of what resembles an enormous shopping trolley but is in fact a 
functioning vehicle.

Anthony's
 work includes Corpse Bride with Tim Burton and Wes 
Anderson, whose Grand Budapest Hotel is in cinemas now.

Commercial clients have included Microsoft, HSBC, 
Kellogg’s, Cadburys and Audi among others, however he says this was 
one of his most challenging projects.

'Using
 every day shopping to create a car was really fun and creatively 
challenging. It was important to keep the character of the car in the 
Clubcard Fuel Save adverts, while representing the vast range of 
products in store, from groceries and kitchen products to clothing and 
toys. 

The car includes features such as a hudl tablet rear view mirror and lamp wing camembert fuel caps

'The car really brings the initiative to life and it has been great to work on such a unique project.'

The vehicle was launched to mark 
Tesco's initiative to give customers up to 20 pence off per litre of 
fuel just by doing a regular shop.

New research has revealed that almost
 half of the nation (46 per cent) aren't seeing their friends and 
family due to high fuel prices.

Furthermore, one in five (17 per cent) are being forced to cut back on food so that they can afford fuel.

This new initiative doesn’t require a one-off minimum spend; for every £50 spent in store, and on groceries online, across one month customers will automatically save 2p per litre of fuel. The scheme does not rely on paper vouchers but instead the clubcard tracks purchases.

Tesco shopper Jane Jeffrey fills up much to the amusement of passers by
