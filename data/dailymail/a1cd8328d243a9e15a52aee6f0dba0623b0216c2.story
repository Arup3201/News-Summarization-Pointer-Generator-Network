Wimbledon will not be changing the way the grass is prepared for next week’s start, despite all the slips and falls that became such a  talking point 12 months ago.

Few know the lawns of the All England Club as well as Tim Henman, who revealed yesterday that research by the club found no underlying cause for the amount of players who marked the first week by sprawling all over the courts.

‘It didn’t perturb myself or Neil Stubley (the head groundsman) because we  collect and study so much information about the courts,’ said Henman. ‘We scientifically measure things like their hardness, the length of the grass, the moisture, the bounce. These were found to be identical to the year before.

‘I was watching Queen’s and seeing players sliding everywhere and nobody was commenting. There will always be some slips and falls on new grass courts early in a tournament and it’s understandable that there is more focus on Wimbledon.

‘I think it was emphasised a bit more last year because some high-profile players like Maria Sharapova and Caroline Wozniacki had falls. One of the benefits of having a three-week gap between the French and Wimbledon from next year is that players will have more time to adjust and they will be  moving better from the start.’

Henman sits on the tournament’s Committee of Management that also hands out wildcards and hopes the arrival of Australian Bob Brett as the LTA’s Director of Player Development will mean more British players put a strong case forward for receiving them.

‘I think he (Brett) will ensure very high standards are set. There are no grey areas about trying to be as successful a player as you can, you have to be properly committed. Dan Evans (GB No 2) is an example of someone who has a lot of natural ability but has a challenge in giving that consistent commitment.’

Henman believes that, regardless of what happened in 2013, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal are the favourites for Wimbledon. ‘I think you have to say they are, based on what has happened so far this year, but Andy Murray and Roger  Federer are only just behind.

‘Roger is 
an interesting one, it’s getting harder for him at other Slams but he 
should see this as a chance to add to his tally. I can see him being 
very dangerous.’

Staying power: Tim Henman would like to see Andy Murray take on Amelie Mauresmo as his long-term coach

On the subject of Amelie Mauresmo, Henman believes it important that her arrival in Murray’s camp is seen as long-term and not as a trial. ‘I hope it lasts a long time because continuity is important and you don’t want an air of something being a trial.

‘I think the role of Dani (Vallverdu, Murray’s assistant coach) is going to be very important this fortnight. He doesn’t always gets the credit he deserves, he knows Andy better than anyone.’
