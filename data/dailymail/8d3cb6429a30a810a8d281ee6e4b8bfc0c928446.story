Shamed designer John Galliano, who was sacked by Dior in 2011 for a series of racist and anti-Semitic offences, has been hired as creative director of Belgian brand Maison Martin Margiel.

The British designer, 53, was asked to leave his job after a damning video emerged of him telling a woman whom he thought was Jewish that he 'loves Hitler' and that her parents should have been 'gassed'.

He then allegedly ranted to an Asian man sitting with her: '****ing Asian b******, I'm going to kill you.' 

Two other women also complained to police about suffering anti-Semitic abuse at the hands of the designer.

Face of Dior, Natalie Portman, was amongst those outraged by his remarks. At the time the Oscar-winning actress said: 'In light of this video, and as an individual who is proud to be Jewish, I will not be associated with Mr Galliano in any way.

'I hope at the very least these terrible comments remind us to reflect and act upon combating these still-existing prejudices that are the opposite of all that is beautiful.' 

Dior owners LVMH cited a zero-tolerance policy on racism and anti-Semitism and immediately gave the designer his marching orders. He was later charged in court and given a suspended sentence.

Since then, Galliano has undergone treatment for drugs and alcohol and worked briefly as a designer for New York fashion brand Oscar de la Renta in 2013.

A graduate of London's prestigious Central Saint Martin's College, Galliano was famous for his theatrical, romantic shows at Dior as well as for his creative designs for his John Galliano brand, which is still owned and run by LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group.

But Renzo Rosso, president of Only the Brave group, which owns Maison Martin Margiel as well as jeans brand Diesel, Marni and Viktor & Rolf, would prefer not to dwell on the past.

He said in a statement: 'This appointment marks a new era in the history of the Maison.' 

He also described Galliano as a 'a visionary and non-conformist'. 

The brand's founder Martin Margiela left his fashion house in 2009. Before that he kept a very low profile, rarely giving interviews. When he did, he preferred to do so in writing, and he would generally sign Maison Martin Margiela as opposed to his own name.

His brand's products did not carry the Belgian fashion house's name, but visible white stitches instead as a signature.

'They hired the most visible designer to replace the most invisible designer, which is very ironic and funny and from that point of view, very much in the spirit of Maison Martin Margiela,' said Bea Ercolini, editor-in-chief at the Belgian edition of fashion magazine, Elle.

Since Margiela left, the brand has been led by a team of designers.

Galliano's first show for the brand will be in January for Haute Couture week in Paris.

OTB acquired Maison Martin Margiela in 2002 and the brand, which now makes around 100 million euros in annual sales, has been profitable for just under three years. In 2013, OTB made total revenues of 1.6 billion euros.
