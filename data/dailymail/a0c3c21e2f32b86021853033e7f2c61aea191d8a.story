This is the moment an entire train carriage was taken over by drunken students who can be seen jumping on seats and banging on the roof as they sing 'We love drinking in the morning'.

Up to 30 revellers, the majority of them female, appeared to simply take over the carriage on the train as it made its way from Richmond to London Waterloo.

Passengers on adjacent carriages were left confused when they first heard singing on the train, and even thought it was drunk rugby fans at nearby Twickenham.

But as the train continued past the stadium it became clear the noise was coming from the train itself.

Sean O'Hare, from Teddington, south west London, was on his way home from football practice at about 10pm on Wednesday when he heard the singing on the train.

He said: 'I thought it was coming from outside at the time - we were at Twickenham and I thought it was a load of drunk rugby fans, but then the train started moving forward and I thought "hang on, it's actually coming from the carriage in front".

'So I got up, I went forward and looked through the window between the connecting carriage doors and it was full of all these girls on the seats, banging on the roof of the train and singing at the tops of their voices "We love drinking in the morning".

'They were obviously having a right gay old time.'

Mr O'Hare said it seemed as if the entire carriage had been taken over by the partygoers.

Passengers on other carriages were left 'stunned and looking at each other in bewilderment'

He said: 'There must have been about 30 of them. There didn't seem to be any other passengers, they seemed to have taken over the whole of the carriage.

'You would have thought it was some sort of private function - I've never seen anything like it.

'At first nobody really knew where it was coming from because it was so loud and you just don't expect that.

'Everyone was stunned and looking at each other in bewilderment.'
