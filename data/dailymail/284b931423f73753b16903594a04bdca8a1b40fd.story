A wedding party with 80 guests - including 60 serving police officers - fell ill with norovirus after being served food 'unfit for human consumption'.

The happy couple and the majority of their guests became unwell with the vomiting bug after eating vegetarian lasagne and fish pie during the reception at The Globe Inn at Frogmore, Devon.

Pub owners John Horsley, 64, and wife Lynda, 63, have been fined £10,000 for using dirty cleaning equipment and unclean food at the party.

They admitted three charges of breaching food hygiene laws at Torquay Magistrates Court and were fined £4,999 each.

Environmental health inspectors found unacceptable levels of bacteria on a towel used for hand drying and a pot sponge after the party last year. 

The court heard how the couple failed to keep premises clean and have a proper system in place to check hygiene.

They were also found to have been unable to comply with food safety requirements. 

Prosecutor Graham Gover told the court: 'There was a report of an outbreak of food poisoning at the hotel which had been taken over by a couple celebrating their marriage and available for guests.'

Ashleigh Harold, representing the couple, said her clients were devastated and deeply affected by the event and strived to do the best they could.

She said the Horsleys notified the council the next available day after receiving complaints and have made a number of improvements since.

Deep cleaning has now been undertaken and is done on a routine basis, with food areas redesigned, staff retrained and better food safety management systems in place.

Following the hearing, Simon Wright, South Hams District Council's executive member with responsibility for environmental health, said: 'We are always happy to work with businesses to ensure that public health is protected.

'However, where conditions are consistently poor then we will take any necessary action to protect the public.' 

Norovirus, sometimes known as the winter vomiting bug, is the most common stomach bug in the UK.

The virus is highly contagious. It can affect people of all ages and causes vomiting and diarrhoea.

There's no specific cure for norovirus, so you have to let it run its course. It's usually mild and shouldn't last more than a couple of days.

The period from when you're infected to when you start to show symptoms (the incubation period) usually lasts between 12 and 48 hours. You may be infectious to other people during this time.

Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it's not usually dangerous and most people make a full recovery within a couple of days without having to see their GP.
