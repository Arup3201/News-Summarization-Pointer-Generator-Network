Clocking in: Lord Hanningfield, pictured today with his dog Theodore, has been found clocking in to Parliament for just 20 minutes a day so he can claim £300 in taxpayers' cash

The Cabinet today rounded on a disgraced peer found clocking in to Parliament for just 20 minutes a day so he can claim £300 in taxpayers' cash.

Lord Hanningfield, a former Conservative, has dismissed the row as a 'storm in a tea cup'.

But Cabinet minister Lord Hill said he was 'dismayed' by the behaviour and the 'shadow' it cast over Parliament.

Lord Hill, the Leader of the Lords, said the rules could tightened to prevent the practice amid claims dozens of others peers could be doing the same thing.

Lord Hanningfield has been exposed for repeatedly turning up to Westminster just to register his presence before heading home again.

On one occasion, he was seen arriving at Westminster before departing the Houses of Parliament 21 minutes later to return home, after checking in with a clerk.

Today the 73-year-old insisted he had never made any money from his public work and the revelations about his clocking in was 'a lot of rubbish'.

The peer was jailed two years ago for fiddling his overnight stay allowance.

His actions caused the parliamentary authorities to scrap overnight allowances.

But an expose by the Mirror showed that the peer was still finding ways to maximise his allowance.

Members of the House of Lords do not get paid a salary unlike MPs. Instead, they get a day rate of up to £300 for turning up.

But rules stipulate they should take part in votes, debates and in committees.

Lord Hanningfield was scrutinised for one month this summer during which he claimed £5,700 despite spending fewer than 40 minutes in Parliament for 11 out of 19 days.

In the House of Lords today, Lord Hill told peers: 'Like me, Noble Lords will have been completely dismayed to read the reports in the press this morning about the behaviour of a Member of our House.

'Dismayed about the behaviour, and dismayed about the shadow it casts over the whole House.'

Amendments to the peers' code of conduct would be examined, Lord Hill said in statement, to allow more discretion to act against members who 'bring the House into disrepute'.

There was already action in train to introduce a new sanction of withdrawing financial support and access to facilities from members who breach the code, he pointed out. That is due to be brought forward early next year.

But Lord Hanningfield insisted he had not profited from his role in public life.

He said: 'This is a lot of rubbish. It's a storm in a tea cup. It's a lot of 
rubbish about nothing that the Mirror have done.

'I wasn't very well in July, so I didn't spend as long in London as I have in the last three months.'

He
told Sky News: 'I’ve done nothing wrong, I haven’t done anything wrong,
I’ve been doing my work. I double check with the finance department all
the time.

'I don't have this money myself, I give it to other people. I've never made a penny out of my public work.'

Jailed: Lord Hanningfield was jailed in 2011 for wrongly claiming nearly £14,000 in expenses

Earlier he told the Mirror: 'Clocking in and out of Parliament is only part of being a peer.'

The former Essex County Council leader, whose real name is Paul White, also said he had worked 'for 40 years for nothing'.

He added that it cost him £150 a day in expenses to attend Parliament so 'I don't really make a profit'.

Around half of all peers were doing the same, he added. But turning up to parliament was just part of the Lords' work, he said.

Lord Hanningfield was jailed in 2011 for wrongly claiming nearly £14,000 in expenses.

The
peer was raking in taxpayers' cash at a rate of £174 a night for 
overnight stays in London at a time when he was not in the city.

He was released after three months and put on a home detention curfew. On the orders of the court, he has also paid back £70,000 in false expense claims.

He has claimed more than £50,000 since returning to Parliament in April 2012.

The former leader of Essex County Council, who was stripped of the Tory whip in 2010, said that in July he had been 'trying to get myself back on track' after suffering a breakdown because of the expenses scandal.

Since October, he said, he had 'dramatically' upped his contributions in the Lords - speaking twice and attending committees.

'Day rate': Members of the House of Lords do not get paid a salary unlike MPs. Instead, they get a day rate of up to £300 for turning up. But rules stipulate they should take part in votes, debates and in committees

The Mirror said that between April 
2012 and July 2013 he claimed a total of £51,300 in attendance allowance
despite making no speeches in the Lords chamber.

'Being
a lord is not just going in the House of Lords. It's the post you have.
I have 15 letters a day, I have all sorts of things like that,' Lord 
Hanningfield said.

'I can do some of it at home, some of it at my office in the Lords.

'I
admit I don't go much into the main chamber. If you look at my records 
since October it's changed dramatically because I've spoken twice.

'Let me explain again. I was trying to get myself organised after a nervous breakdown, a traumatic period.'
