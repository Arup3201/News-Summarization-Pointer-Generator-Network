American Science and Engineering (AS&E) has revealed its portable X-ray detection system that can be used by security enforcement on the go.

Dubbed the Mini Z, the Massachusetts-based company said the handheld device can be used for fast, real-time detection of potential threats inside objects such as backpacks, tyres and more.

The device reveals the interior of its target on a screen using backscatter technology, which detects radiation that reflects from a target.

Massachusetts-based AS&E have unveiled their Z Backscatter X-ray scanner called the Mini Z. It will retail for £30,000 ($50,000) and is apparently able to detect potential threats in locations other scanners cannot reach, such as airplane seats and in bags at events

The Mini Z, which costs £30,000 ($50,000), can detect a range of ‘hidden organic threats’ according to AS&E.

Length: 11.5 in (29.2 cm)

Width: 9.8 in (24.9 cm)

Height: 7.6 in (19.3 cm)

Weight: 9 lbs (4 kg)

Operating Time: 4 hrs per battery charge

Scan Speed: 6 in (15 cm) per second (typical)

Ambient Operating Temperature: 0°C to 45°C (32°F to 113°F)

Screen: Windows 8.1 Tablet PC

These include drugs, explosives and even plastic guns that would otherwise be missed by more 'traditional' X-ray systems.

They also claim it is the world’s first handheld Z Backscatter handheld imaging system.

The device works by having a single-sided imager on the front.

When the user presses a button on the top it begins scanning in front of it and procures a real-time image of the target on a tablet, which acts as the screen.

This can spot materials that more traditional systems such as transmission X-ray can miss including explosives, currency, and drugs.

The system also does not require any set-up and can be used immediately.

And, the company added, the system is safe for operators, bystanders and the environment because the X-ray dose is within radiation safety standards, although it is not designed to scan people.

‘Leveraging the breakthrough capabilities of our Z Backscatter detection technology, the Mini Z system is AS&E's initial offering of what will be a family of portable backscatter products,’ said Chuck Dougherty, AS&E's President and CEO.

The product is a miniaturisation of the technology used in the Z Backscatter Van [ZBV] already manufactured by the company, which is used to scan much larger objects like trucks and containers.

This, said Dougherty, makes it ‘more affordable and accessible to a broader range of customers.’

He adds: ‘The Mini Z system is a game-changer for law enforcement and border security officials who are constantly challenged to quickly and accurately detect potential threats in hard-to-reach environments as they work to ensure the highest level of public safety.’

Such hard-to-reach places include vehicle bumpers, tyres, panels and interiors at border and security checkpoints.

It can also be used to scan hand baggage at events, perform security sweeps of meeting rooms and inspect the seats of planes for hidden contraband.
