Authorities say a 29-year-old woman from Chicago woman attempted to kill her son and daughter by lacing their apple juice with crushed tranquilizers.

Krystle El Khatib of Schiller Park appeared on Thursday in Cook County court in Rolling Meadows on attempted murder charges.

She is accused of mixing powder from crushed-up anti-anxiety pills into juice and forcing her nine-year-old son and four-year-old daughter to drink it on Sunday. 

Charged: Krystle El Khatib, 29, of Schiller Park has been charged with trying to kill her children by feeding them juice laced with drugs, according to prosecutors

Issues: The woman appeared in court Thursday on attempted murder charges. A judge set her bond at $1.5 million

Authorities say she was angry at the children's father and had sent him a threatening message. Then, they say she tried kill herself with a similar cocktail consisting of benzodiazepine and the painkiller Norco.

Problems: The Illinois mom allegedly attempted to poison her son and daughter on Sunday

Prosecutors in court Thursday described El Khatib as being angry at the children's father for not wanting to spend time with her and not being home with the children. 

Authorities said she sent a text to the father Saturday that read: 'At least if I go to hell, I've already been there. The kids go to heaven. Peace from all.' 

Officials say the children have recovered and are now in the custody of their dad.

A judge set her bond at $1.5 million. Her public defender says she has no criminal history. 

El Khatib was later found at her home by police and also taken to the hospital.

At the hospital, a criminal complaint against El Khatib says she 'told a social worker at the hospital that she brought her kids into this world and she can take them out.'

Staff at the hospital sent a police officer to check on Krystle El Khatib. 

When the law enforcement officers arrived at her home, they found that she was also in need of medical attention. 

Fall from grace: Records show El Khatib filed for bankruptcy In 2007. At that time, she listed Comcast Cable as her employer but, more recently, she described herself in online profiles as an actress and model

El Khatib reportedly told the police that she gave the anti-anxiety drugs to her children because she “wanted all three of them to go to sleep and not wake up.”

The Illinois Department of Children and Family Services is currently investigating allegations of abuse and neglect inside the El Khatib home. 

The child protection agency had not had any prior contact with the family.

Tumultuous relationships: El Khatib was married for a short time to Bill Intzekiotis, records show. She was 17 at the time of their marriage, Intzekiotis said, and they divorced after less than a year
