A plane which crashed during an attempted landing in a tropical storm, killing 49 people, is believed to have been due to pilot error.

The official report on the October 2013 crash of Lao Airlines flight QV301, which had six Australians on board, was released on Friday and presented to the friends and family of the victims.

The crash has raised further questions about the safety of airlines operating out of Southeast Asia, with a 20% increase reported in people flying in the region.

Along with the Australian nationals, seven French, five Thai, three South Koreans, two Vietnamese, as well as individuals from China, Myanmar, Taiwan and the US died in the crash. 

The Lao Airlines flight tried to land at Pakse International Airport in Laos in the middle of a heavy storm, but pilot Yong Sam was forced to ascend again after failing the attempt.

The 56-year-old Cambodian had more than 30 years flying experience, with the report noting that he was a skilled pilot used to flying the aircraft.

Despite a recommended height of 990 feet, Yong Sam reached an altitude of only 600 feet before attempting to execute another landing, hitting an island in the Mekong River and killing all those on baord.

The victims bodies were recovered from the water over several weeks, with some victims found almost 20 kilometers downstream from the crash site

'It was raining but the pilot continued the approach and lastly decided to go around at an altitude below (recommended levels) in a steep right turn,' the report said.

'It impacted the trees on an island in the Mekong, the fuselage struck the bank and plunged into the river.' 

The victims bodies were recovered from the water over several weeks, with some victims found almost 20 kilometers  downstream from the crash site. 

The document states that the probable cause of the crash included sudden changes in weather conditions and the airline crew's failure to 'properly execute the published instrument approach'.

While Pakse airport is not equipped with radar control, the report notes that there were 'no anomalies' concerning ground equipment. 

Lao Airlines is not a member of the International Air Transport Association, which requires safety checks.

Relatives from the 10 countries of those who perished, along with diplomats and representatives of the French-made ATR 72-212A aircraft, were at the briefing on Friday.

Sydney man Gavin Rhodes, his wife Phoumalaysy (Lea), their daughter and baby boy died in the crash.

Gavin's father, Geoff Rhodes, 71, said after some hesitation about travelling to Laos, he and Gavin's sister, Melissa Rhodes-Smith, flew to the hear the report delivered and 'to have my son represented'.

Other Australian victims included 42-year-old Michael Creighton (above) and his father, Gordon, 71

'I'd like to come and bring the photograph to show what I have lost,' Mr Rhodes said.

In 2014 so far there have been five major plane crashes in Southeast Asia, including the doomed Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 en route to Kuala Lumpur, and the disappearance of MH370 en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur.

The Centre for Asia-Pacific Aviation recorded a 20% increase in seat volume between 2012 and 2013, totalling 5.6 million passengers on flights in the region.

The figures are expected to increase, with 70% of the world's busiest routes travelling through Southeast Asia, and 30% of the world's aircraft passengers expected to travel to the region in 2014, reported Orient Aviation Journal. 

Willem Niemeijer, co-founder of Khiri Travel Group, told Quartz that 'Increasing air traffic means crashes will increase as well.'

The company operates throughout Southeast Asia, a region which 'needs to look at improving air infrastructure and pursue an open skies policy,' Mr Niemeijer said.

While more than 30% of plane crashes around the world occur as a result of weather conditions, ground-based wind-shear detection systems introduced to notify plane crews to issues, are absent in airports around Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines.   

Mr Rhodes said that the conclusion of the pilot's responsibility made little difference to the reality of losing his son. 

'Does it make any difference to how I feel? No,' he said.

Gavin Rhodes sister, Ms Rhodes-Smith said that attending the reading of the report was important to her and her family.

'Just being here as well, being in Vientiane where they spent their last few days and being with Lea's family, it's probably the stuff that makes us feel better,' she said. 

The Rhodes have set up a fund to support a preschool in northern Laos in memory of Mr Rhodes and his family. 

'Just having that purpose - it's one of the things that helped us the most - is being able to do something in memory of them,' Ms Rhodes said.

Other Australian victims included 42-year-old Michael Creighton, who was an aid worker in Laos, and his father, Gordon, 71, who was visiting his son. 

Both black box data recorders had been analysed by air safety experts in France.
