More than 40 people have been injured, four of them seriously, after a fire broke out in a Dutch care home for the elderly.

The fire broke out at the building in the eastern city of Nijmegen shortly after 7am - with firefighters and rescue workers using cranes to help the building's many bed-bound residents to escape.

At least eleven people have been rushed to hospital, with four said to be in a 'serious condition'. A further 30 people were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation.

Around an hour after the fire broke out an air conditioning unit inside the building collapsed, leading firefighters to initially release a statement suggesting the roof of the building had caved in and people could be trapped beneath the rubble.

Firefighters are seen battling the blaze at the residential care home earlier this morning

The fire is understood to have started in a canteen area of the residential care home shortly after 7am local time this morning.

The canteen area is not connected to the residential quarters and the surroundings rooms are not thought to have been occupied when the blaze broke out.

Following the evacuation, many of the elderly residents were given shelter in an apartment building across the street, while the more able-bodied were told to go by bus to a nearby community centre.

The Mayor of Nijmegen later addressed residents at the care home.
