Fitbit and rival exercise bands have been around for a few years, but the world's largest
software company's has only now made its debut into the wearable technology market, launching an exercise band, smartwatch hybrid.

Microsoft has revealed its device, called 'Microsoft Band,' which will allow users to monitor their fitness and exercise regime, as well as check their texts and emails.

The wrist-worn device has 10 smart sensors that monitor pulse rate,
measure calorie burn and track sleep quality, Microsoft said in
a blog post.

Late on the bandwagon? Microsoft has launched a device called 'Microsoft Band' (pictured) that will allow users to monitor their fitness and exercise regime

It also offers guided workouts, which are drills designed to meet a user's needs and GPS route mapping so users can see where they have run or cycled.

'Microsoft Band makes it easier to reach your fitness goals. You can track your daily physical activity and review your stats with a glance at your wrist,' the Redmond, Washington-based company writes on its website.

'Just like a personal trainer, Microsoft Band guides you to improved wellness by constantly learning about you, your current fitness level, and your future needs.'

Unlike the forthcoming Apple Watch, people won't be able to make phone calls from the device, but like other smartwatches, such as the Motorola 360, they will be able to read texts, emails, social media updates and other notifications. 

'It also helps you be more productive with email previews and calendar alerts - right on your wrist,' the company,' Microsoft said. 

Users will be able to talk to their device using the Cortana personal assistant, which is similar to Apple's Siri. 

Using Windows 8.1, users can ask Cortana to take notes or set reminders. 'She'll give you driving directions and keep you on top of traffic spots, weather and more,' according to Microsoft.

The wrist-worn device (pictured left) has sensors that monitor pulse rate,measure calorie burn and track sleep quality, Microsoft said. It works alongside a health app called 'Microsoft Health' (shown on various devices) that includes a cloud service for users to store and combine health and fitness data

Fitness functions: The band is primarily a fitness band. It features smart sensors that monitor pulse rate, measure calorie burn and track sleep quality.

The device also offers workouts put together by Men's Health, for example, and GPS route mapping so users can see where they have ran or cycled.

Smartwatch features: The device doesn't allow people to make calls directly, but does push notifications about calls, texts and emails from a user's smartphone to their Microsoft Band.

It has Microsoft's Cortana personal assistant built-in so people can talk to the device to ask it to take notes or set reminders, for example.

Appearance: The band is primarily made of rubber and features a sleek colour touchscreen. Users can change the background screen's colour and design.

Sensors: It has 10 sensors that monitor everything from heart rate and sleep to UV, prompting wearers to apply sunscreen.

Price: $199.

Availability: US only from today. UK prices and availability haven't been announced yet.

Microsoft Band has a rubber strap and colour touch screen with a customisable background. It also has a UV sensor that tells wearers when to apply sunscreen.

The device is designed to work alongside iPhone, Android and Windows Phone handsets, and will be available in the United
States from today for $199. UK availability and pricing has yet to be announced.

It will compete with the highly anticipated Apple Watch, which was unveiled  on September 9 and is set to go on sale in early 2015 for $349.

Meanwhile, Samsung Electronics is already selling its Galaxy Gear smart watch and Motorola and LG also have versions on the market.

Microsoft also launched a health app called 'Microsoft
Health' that includes a cloud service for users to store and
combine health and fitness data. 

The  app will collect data from the fitness
band and will work on iPhones and Android smartphones, as well
as the Windows Phone.

Microsoft Health will unite data from different health and fitness devices and services such as UP by Jawbone, MapMyFitness and RunKeeper, in a single location.

Data from different devices and services, such as steps, calories and heart rate will be combined, enabling an 'Intelligence Engine' to say which exercises were most effective during a workout and suggest a recommended recovery time.

Over time, data can be combined with a calendar, enabling the Intelligence Machine to get smarter and offer suggestions for workouts that fit with a user's schedule, Microsoft said.

As well as being a fitness tracker, the band enables wearers to see their emails, calender, texts, social media updates and other push notifications on their wrist. The device will be available in the US in limited quantities from today for $199

Microsoft Band contains built-in GPS and 24-hour heart rate monitoring, which the company says is to help wearers reach their fitness goals. 'By combining the power of each of our sensors, Microsoft Band is able to give you real-time insights into your performance today and your milestones into the future,' the company says

Ben Wood Chief of Research CCS Insight said Microsoft's move to launch a health-tracking wearable isn't surprising and puts it in direct competition with Apple’s iHealth and Google Fit as well as the plethora of proprietary health platforms from companies such as FitBit, Jawbone and Withings.

'Consumers now have an overwhelming choice of health-related cloud platforms to choose from...It’s going to be a tough decision to choose whether to place their loyalty with Apple, Google or Microsoft given the immaturity of all three platforms.

'The Microsoft Band enters a highly competitive market where the company has little or no brand. At $200 Microsoft is targeting the higher tiers of the fitness band market – its going to have make a big marketing investment to raise awareness with US consumers. 

'There are already numerous other products with heart rate sensors that track fitness and sleep including the new product Fitbit announced earlier this week.

'It’s interesting that Microsoft is clearly positioning its product as a fitness band rather than a smart watch given it has many of the features several smart watches already support. It is banking on the fact that consumers don’t want to replace their watches and that this will be what it calls the "band for the other hand"'.

Fitbit has revealed a trio of new trackers this week - including a $250 smartwatch, which it hopes can take on the Apple Watch.

Called Surge, the watch has GPS, heart rate monitoring and smartwatch functionality. The firm has also added a heart rate monitor to its traditional tracing wristband, now called the chargeHR.

Fitbit's new range includes the $129 Fitbit charge, the $149 chargeHR while also has a heart rate sensors, and the $249 Surge which has GPS, heart rate monitoring and smartwatch functionality.

'Continuing our mission to inspire people to lead healthier, more active lives, we’re releasing these three new innovative devices to help reach everyday, active or performance health and fitness goals,' the San Francisco firm says.

The Surge watch will put the firm on a collision course with Apple - and now Microsoft.

'Surge is Fitbit’s most advanced tracker to date: a sleek ‘Fitness Super Watch,’ designed for those looking for peak performance,' the firm said.

'Featuring 8-sensor technology that combines all-day fitness tracking with GPS, heart rate monitoring and smartwatch functionality.

'Surge is ideal for users committed to training, dedicated to health and consistently looking to improve progress.'
