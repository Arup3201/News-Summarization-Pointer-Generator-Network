Threats: Kate McCann, mother of missing girl Madeleine, has reportedly had a death threat from an online troll

Kate McCann has reportedly received a death threat as she prepares to run the London Marathon next month.

It emerged yesterday that an internet troll threatened to shoot her in a Facebook post, according to the Sun.

McCann, mother of Madeleine McCann who disappeared in 2007, is taking part in the Marathon to raise money for the Missing People charity.

She will be running in her role as official ambassador for the charity.

Under a link on Facebook about McCann, 45, doing the Marathon someone wrote:

'Well I am going to, Anyone got a Gun ? BBBangggggg? (sic)'

The McCann's family spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, told the Sun: 'This material has been brought to the attention of the police.

'One of the posts is actually a death threat and is being dealt with appropriately'

The London Marathon takes place on April 21 and McCann is expected to still take part.

Earlier this month, police had a new lead in the hunt for Madeleine McCann.

Police are now looking for team of British cleaners in white van who were working in the resort of Praia da Luz at the time.

A white van has been mentioned in connection with Madeleine's disappearance before, but this is the first time a team of British cleaners has come up.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman told MailOnline: 'Officers are reviewing all of the material in relation to the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.

Still missing: Madeleine McCann, daughter of Kate McCann and Gerry McCann

'This is routine procedure as part of the ongoing review.'

Operation Grange was set up by the Metropolitan Police two years ago at the request of Prime Minister David Cameron following a plea by Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry, of Rothley, Leicestershire.

In May it will be six years since Madeleine disappeared from the Portuguese holiday resort.
