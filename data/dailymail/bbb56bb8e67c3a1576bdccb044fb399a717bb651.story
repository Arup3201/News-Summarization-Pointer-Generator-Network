A popular high school cheerleader is fighting for her life in a medically-induced coma after a weekend trip to visit her brother in college ended in tragedy.

Tampa, Florida 18-year-old Jackie Faircloth was visiting her older brother J.T. at Florida State University in Tallahassee, when she was hit by a truck crossing the road after a football game around 2am on November 29.

'She stepped out into the road and I yelled, "Jackie, there's a car, look out,'' J.T. told WTSP.

Driver Devon Dwyer, 20, never stopped to help the Plant High School cheerleader, but was arrested two days later when the passenger in the car notified authorities. 

Fighting for her life: 18-year-old Jackie Faircloth was struck by a hit-and-run driver crossing the street in Tallahassee, Florida late last month, and remains in medically-induced coma

Jackie was rushed to the hospital in critical condition, where doctors placed her in a medically induced coma so she could recover from her injuries which included major head trauma, serious chest injury, a broken jaw and ear drum.

The swelling in Jackie's brain went down substantially this week, enough to allow doctor's to perform a crucial surgery and she is responding to medication. But she remains in a coma. 

On Monday, driver Devon Dwyer, a former standout high school football player in Orlando who went on to play at Western Illinois University for two seasons, was arrested and charged with fleeing the scene of an accident. 

Dwyer's friend Jacob Sallow, a FSU junior,  went to the police on Monday to identify Dwyer as the hit-and-run driver. 

Sallow was in Dwyer's red pickup truck when he hit Faircloth, as the two were driving home from working a shift at PotBelly's Bar. 

Sallow says he didn't see Dwyer hit Jackie, since he was looking down at his cellphone at the moment, but  'heard impact of a person hitting the bottom side of the driver side windshield' and saw the windshield shatter like a spider-web.

Popular: Hundreds gathered to hold a candlelight vigil for Jackie outside her high school last week 

Recovering: Jackie remains in a coma, but swelling in her brain has gone down considerably and she is reacting to medication 

Smiles: According to photos posted to her Facebook, Jackie is an active young woman who enjoys fishing, swimming and paddle-boarding 

'He stated that Dwyer became very panicky, but continued driving and never slowed down or stopped the vehicle,' according to the police report. '[Salow] stated Dwyer kept looking over at him and was saying, "It's not my fault. She stepped in front of the car."' 

After the crash,  Dwyer continued to a friend's house where Sallow had his girlfriend pick him up. As she arrived, Dwyer 'was yelling at a few of his friends that he needed to hide his vehicle'. 

Police were able to recover the vehicle when they arrested Dwyer and booked him into Leon County Jail Monday night. He is no longer listed as an inmate there though, according to the jail's website.

It's unclear why Dwyer was afraid to stop the car, since hitting a pedestrian does not usually become a criminal act until the driver flees the scene, according to Florida state law. 

The Faircloth family had previously offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the driver's arrest, but Sallow's lawyer said he did not know about it when he came forward. 

Sallow has told the family he does not want the reward, and would rather it be spent on Jackie's medical bills. 

Reward: Jackie's family initially offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the driver 

Meanwhile, the Plant High School community has been shaken by Jackie' absence from school, and last week held a candlelight vigil in front of the school. 

Friends have also been organizing prayer schedules, to make sure someone is praying for Jackie every 15 minutes, as well as group prayer sessions before school. 

Her friends have described her as a popular girl who many looked up to.

'She has a lot of friends. She brings a lot of smiles to people's faces. She's someone the younger girls look up to. She's a roll model to them, so it's traumatizing,' said Jackie's cousin Rex Culpepper.

Rex Culpepper is the son of Brad Culpepper, a retired football player who once played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and University of Florida.
