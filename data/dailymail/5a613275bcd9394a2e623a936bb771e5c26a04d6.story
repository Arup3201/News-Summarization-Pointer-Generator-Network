China's biggest airlines will not pay a new European Union tax aimed at cutting carbon emissions, their trade body has said.

On New Year’s Day the EU brought airlines under its Emissions Trading Scheme, which levies a charge based on their carbon emissions.

Chai Haibo, of the China Air Transport Association – which represents national flag carrier Air China – said its members would not co-operate.

However the EU insisted it would not back down.

Airlines which do not comply with the tax can be fined and even prohibited from flying into the European Union.

It is claimed the plan could cost Chinese airlines £79million in extra annual costs.

‘The CATA, on behalf of Chinese airlines, is strongly against the EU’s improper practice of unilaterally forcing international airlines into its ETS,’ Mr Chai said.

He said China would try to force Brussels to scrap the initiative, declaring: ‘If governments like the U.S., China and Russia can launch strong and forceful retaliatory measures, this will form enormous pressure and we hope could make the EU change its mind.’

Anger: A United Airlines flight takes off from Frankfurt Airport - one of Europe's busiest. Under the scheme, airlines will be given free credits this year, but in future will have to buy or trade them to cover the levy

However Isaac Valero-Ladron, EU spokesman for climate action, said: ‘We’re not modifying our law and we’re not backing down.

'We’re confident companies will comply. The penalties for non-compliance are much higher.’

The ETS requires airlines flying to or from Europe to obtain ‘permits to pollute’ for carbon dioxide emissions.

The European Commission has assessed the impact on air fares at around £10.50 per passenger, per flight to the U.S. – or £84 for a family of four making a round trip.

China warned it may bring in retaliatory measures against the levy, also criticised by India, the U.S. and Canada.
