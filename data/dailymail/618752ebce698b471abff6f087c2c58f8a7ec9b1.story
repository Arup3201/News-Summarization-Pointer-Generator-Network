For millions of students the early 
weeks of university are a raucous mix of letting their hair down, 
getting to know the local nightlife and making new friends.

But
for freshers at Cambridge University in the 17th century, even playing 
football was seen as unruly and 'boisterous' behaviour.

A
rulebook for Cambridge students dating back to 1660 offers a 
fascinating insight into what university life was like more than 350 years ago.

Strict: The Cambridge University Duport Rules which was handed out to Trinity College students in 1660 which reveals long lie-ins were frowned upon, gossiping was banned and picking your nose forbidden

Dress code: Various scholars in academic dress in an excerpt from the book

Unlike
life on campus today, long lie-ins were frowned upon, gossiping with 
roommates was banned and picking your nose was forbidden.

Football was outlawed because it was 'a rude, boisterous exercise, and fitter for Clownes then for Schollers.'

And
newcomers to the university were also advised to only 'use' tennis 
sparingly and never 'immediately after meales' because it was 'too 
violent and too stirring'.

Code of conduct: Freshers at Trinity College Cambridge (pictured) in the 17th century were told that even playing 
football was seen as unruly and 'boisterous' behaviour and tennis should be played 'sparingly'

The rulebook was compiled by tutor James Duport and given to new students at Trinity College.

It
reads: 'When you reade or speake in your Tutors Chamber, or else where 
take heed of picking your Nose, or putting your Hatt or Hand to your 
face, or any such odd, uncouth, or unseemly gesture.'

Freshers were advised to make friends only with 'honest, studious, religious youths'.

Warning against bad language, they were also told to 'avoid all profane scurrilous, unsavoury, rotten, frothy communication'.

The rulebook went to warn that gossiping with friends is a waste of time.

It
reads: 'Goe not a gadding and gossiping from Chamber to Chamber, for 
that is no recreation, but meere idlenesse and losse of time'.

Instead the freshers were told: 'Let your discourse be sauoury & sappy.'

Duport's rules also guided students on their appearance.

He wrote: 'Wear no boots, nor powder your hair, let yr Garb be grave & sober, yet cheerful & pleasant.'

And unlike modern students, 17th century scholars were not allowed to lie around in bed, particularly on Sundays.

They were told: 'Rise earlier on the Lords day, then ordinary, and be more carefull to trimme your soules then bodyes.'

They had to attend mandatory chapel services and the rule book warned against being late.

It
read: 'Use to be at Chappell at the beginning & come not drooping 
in (after the uncouth & ungodly manner of some) when almost all is 
done.'

The students of 350 years ago were younger than today's and were taught a curriculum centred on Latin, Greek and Theology.

They were expected to read in the original language of sources and to 'speake Latine alwayes in the Hall'.

As
it was a time of political and economic unrest with the English Civil 
war students were advised to 'Beware of riot, excess & 
intemperance'.

Two 
handwritten version's of Duport's rules are still held by the Wren 
Library at Trinity College and Cambridge University Library.

Their
content has come to light again following a comparison of the two 
manuscripts, published in a paper by academics Dr Christopher Preston 
and Philip Oswald.
