Leeds United are expected to sack manager David Hockaday on Sunday after two turbulent months in charge.

The Yorkshire side were humbled 4-1 at Watford on Saturday, with the result serving as the tipping point for owner Massimo Cellino.

Hockaday will be relieved of his duties after losing three of the opening four Championship games this season. 

Short spell: David Hockaday was sacked after only two months in charge of Leeds

The Leeds squad have been called into an emergency meeting at Elland Road at 2pm on Sunday. 

The former Forest Green Rovers boss called his squad back into the dressing-room off the away coach to discuss the defeat in a bizarre twist at Vicarage Road.

Cellino wasn’t available for comment on Saturday night.

The loss leaves Leeds loitering just outside the bottom three and were reduced to nine-men after having both Giuseppe Bellusci and Sam Byram sent off against the Hornets.

Hockaday only signed a two-year contract in June, an appointment that was met with surprise and shock by many Leeds fans.
