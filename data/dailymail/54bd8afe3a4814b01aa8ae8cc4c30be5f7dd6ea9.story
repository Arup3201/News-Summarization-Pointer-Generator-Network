A man who claims to have raised the murdered love child of Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson said people should stop sympathizing with the player because he didn't even know the two-year-old, it emerged today.

Bobby Ruffin posted a rant on his Facebook page after the boy's death on Friday saying he was the person who raised him and he was even named after him.

The two-year-old was brutally beaten, allegedly at the 
hands of his mother's abusive live-in boyfriend Joseph Patterson, last week and died soon after in hospital, which is where Peterson met his son for the first time.

'So tired of this poor Adrian Peterson s**t. Let me blow all your minds,' Ruffin posted on his wall which was reported today by TMZ.

'The boy who died was my son. Yes AP was the biological father but I raised him and he carried 
my name. Tyrese Robert Ruffin.

'I don’t blame AP for not really caring 
cuz him and I both found out recently who the biological father was. AP met my son for the first time yest [sic] when my son was already in coma.

'I
 was here today when we pulled the plug, not him. He was happily 
practicing and has no problem playing on Sunday.

'So yea this isn’t all out yet but I’m sick of the poor AP s**t. He 
didn’t know or even meet my son. Sorry for the outburst but put yourself
 in my place.'

It emerged earlier today Peterson 
asked for a DNA test to confirm Tyrese was his around two or three 
months ago before he offered to be a part of his life.

The running back did not suspect he 
was being targeted by an ex-girlfriend to scam money from him but wanted
 definitive proof he was the child's biological father before making any
 'big moves'.

Once the test
 came back positive, Peterson promised to be a part of his son's life 
and help him and his mom out financially, a source told TMZ.

Sources say Peterson is planning to fly back to South Dakota to attend his son's funeral later this week after making the decision to play in 
Sunday's NFL clash with the Carolina Panthers.

Explaining his decision before the game he said: 'I’m still hurt and feel the pain of 
life, but I’m able to function because of the peace and joy of knowing 
my loved ones are in a much better place.

'I was set on it. I just look at things and I don't ask people to understand my mindset and how I think. Anything bad, I try to take good from it.

'That's the way I approach life in all situations. I never thought about not playing. It was all about just going out there and praying that I have the strength to get through and help my team. That was my focus.'

Fans held signs that read 'Stay 
Strong 28' and 'Prayers for Adrian,' and several teammates offered hugs 
and well wishes before the game.

'I
 just prayed and asked God to give me the strength just to get through 
the game, just play and focus,' Peterson said. 'And for the most part, I
 did.'

The Panthers beat the Vikings 35-10 in Sunday's game.

Joseph Patterson is charged with aggravated assault and aggravated battery in the death of the two-year-old.

Initially, police were told that the child had choked on candy. Only later did it emerge that his brain injuries were the result of being violently shaken.

The arrest was made after police found the little boy with injuries 'consistent with abuse'.

Patterson is being held in Minnehaha County Jail, South Dakota, on $750,000 cash bond and was scheduled to appear in court on October 23 but that will likely change in the wake of the toddler's death.

Charged: Joseph Robert Patterson, 27,  is charged with aggravated battery of an infant and aggravated assault. It emerged in court that he had previously been charged over domestic violence

South Dakota State’s Attorney Thomas 
Wollman filed motions on Friday ordering Patterson to serve two 
year-long sentences that had been suspended on prior domestic assault 
charges.

Patterson had pleaded guilty in 2012 to simple assault in an incident involving an ex-girlfriend and her three-year-old son.

The woman requested a protection 
order saying the vicious man had spanked her little boy so hard that she
 had to ice the welts on his buttocks, according to the Argus.

She also said that he choked and 
punched her, threatened her with a knife and held her in the bedroom 
against her will, according to records.

The woman asked for the protection orders prior to the birth of the son she has with Patterson.

As part of his prior charges, 
Patterson was ordered to undergo family violence training and to stay 
away from the woman until completing it.

A different woman requested a protection order against Patterson in 2004 in Jackson County.

Thoughts and prayers: Minnesota Vikings fans have been expressing their support for Adrian Peterson and his family after the death of his two-year-old son. Here he is joined by Kyle Rudolph for the National Anthem before Sunday's NFL game

Working through the pain: Oftentimes athletes use work as a cathartic way to move through tragedy and will often dedicate their performance to those that they lost

Peterson has had tragedy peppered 
throughout his life. When he was seven, he saw his older brother die in a
 bike accident after being hit by a drunken driver.

For
 Peterson's teenage years, his father was in prison. He grew up poor in 
east Texas. Shortly before the Minnesota Vikings drafted him in 2007, a 
half-brother, was shot and killed.

Long
 before Peterson began running through the NFL record book, he learned 
to turn tragedy into fuel for an exceptional career.

'Things
 that I go through, I've said a thousand times, it helps me play this 
game to a different level,'he said after practice, about an hour after 
the child's death.

'I'm able to kind of release a lot of my stress 
through this sport, so that's what I plan on doing.'
