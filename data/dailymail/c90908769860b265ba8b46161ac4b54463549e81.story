A woman cleaning out a home for a future episode of reality show "Hoarding: Buried Alive" has developed a respiratory illness caused by deadly hantavirus.

Officials have placed the home in Houston under quarantine.

As many as 30 people, including the film crew and neighbours who volunteered to clean up the home, have been in the house and could have been exposed to the virus.

Contamination: A worker helping to clean out a Texas house for an episode of TCL's Hoarding: Buried Alive is suffering from hantavirus, a rodent-related respiratory disease

Infection with the hantavirus comes from inhaling or ingesting particles of mice droppings, or urine, and has a 40per cent mortality rate.

Three visitors to Yosemite National Park died from the same virus after staying in infested cabins.

Danger: Neighbours have been warned to stay away while the victim, who has not been named, undergoes further tests

Symptoms: National Park pamphlets on the virus describe its flu-like symptoms including headache, fever, muscle ache, shortness of breath and cough

More than 10,000 tourists were warned to watch for symptoms.

Hantaviruses are spread through rodent bites, urine or saliva.

Humans infected can develop potentially fatal diseases, hemorrhagic fever  and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.

Early symptoms are similar to the flu and include chills, fever and muscle aches.

Sufferers
may may begin to feel better for a short  time, but within 1-2 days, 
experience breathing difficulties, a dry cough vomiting and headaches.

Of
the 587 documented U.S. cases since the virus was identified in 1993, 
about one-third proved fatal. There is no specific treatment for the 
virus.

Almost
all cases involving humans have been linked to contact with rodent 
excrement. However human-to-human transmission has been reported with the
Andes mountains in South America.

The
name hantavirus comes from the Hantan River area in South Korea, from 
where the first cases were identified in the late 1970s.

The disease was formerly known as Korean hemorrhagic fever.

The home in the Houston suburb of Woodlands has a sheriff's deputy stationed outside.

Neighbours have been warned to stay away while the victim, who has not been named, undergoes further tests.

A woman who had been in the home to 
help in the cleanup effort tested positive for the disease and is now 
recovering and being placed on a course of antibiotics.

A second test on the woman by the state health department will determine whether she does in fact have hantavirus.

'This particular area, it's an 
extreme case of rodent infestation. There's evidence of rodents, mice, 
snakes, possums in and around the home, which is not unusual in a 
hoarding situation because there's so much material.

'It's impossible to keep it clean and
track the rodent population,' said Dr. Mark Escott with the Montgomery 
County Health Department.

Hantavirus is a disease that's 
carried by rodents, and when you go through processes like cleaning the 
home, sweeping, vacuuming, that sort of thing, it goes into the air.

The hantavirus takes one to six weeks to incubate.

Flu-like symptoms initially appear, and the disease progresses rapidly. Within a day or two it can be very difficult to breathe.
