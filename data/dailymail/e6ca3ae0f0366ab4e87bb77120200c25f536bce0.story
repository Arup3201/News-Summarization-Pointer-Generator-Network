More than a third of new jobs in the UK have been created in London as the capital benefitted from an Olympics boost, new figures revealed today.

Of the 236,000 extra people in work in the three months to July, 91,000 were in London.

Unemployment numbers in London also fell by 22,000, ‘suggesting the Olympics may have added to the boost’, the Office for National Statistics said.

While there has been sharp drop in unemployment in London, other regions have seen rises.

Nationwide jobless total fell by 7,000 from May to July to 2.59 million, an unemployment rate of 8.1 per cent.

There
 was a mixed picture across the country in the level of unemployment 
from May to July. In the three months in London the jobless number fell 
by 22,000. In the North East the figure fell by 11,000 and in the South 
West down by 9,000.

But 
Yorkshire/Humber saw a rise of 23,000 unemployed, in the West Midlands 
the figure was up 16,000 and in Northern Ireland there was a rise of 
10,000.

In
 August there were 1.57 million claiming Jobseekers Allowance, down by 
15,000 on July - the largest monthly fall since June 2010.

David Cameron told MPs: 'Today's unemployment figures show an extra million private sector jobs, net, since the election, which I think is something that shows our economy is rebalancing.'

Today's
 drop in the headline rate of unemployment was lower than many 
economists were expected, but the fall in the claimant count was far 
higher than forecast.

While London saw a drop of 22,000 in unemployment from May to July compared to the previous quarter, other regions including Yorkshire/Humber had sharp rises

The number of people claiming Jobseekers Allowance in August was 1.57 million, down by 15,000 on July.

And it was not all good news for ministers.

The number of people out of work for over a year is now at its highest for more than 16 years - at 904,000, up 22,000 on the previous quarter.

London accounted for 5,500 of the fall in the claimant count, fuelling fears that areas outside the South East are still struggling with the effects of the double dip recession.Liam Byrne, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'When you look beneath the headlines, you can see that in half of our country, unemployment has actually gone up.

'So in three-quarters of Britain now, unemployment is higher today than it was back in May 2010.'

The rise in the number of people in London in work has been linked to extra staff taken on to work in and around the Olympic Park in London.

With London 2012 now over, employment minister Mark Hoban sought to play down the idea that the rise in the number of people in work was just a blip caused by the Games.

He told Sky News: ‘There’s been strong performances in places like the south west, the north west, in the west midlands, so it’s a much broader picture, I think, than simply London driving these numbers forward.

‘Because the Olympics does have an effect – there are people who are employed for the Olympics in London, and that’s why next week we’re having a jobs fair where we’re inviting 2,000 people who had on the Olympics to come and meet local employers to try to find them a permanent job.’

Dave Prentis, Unison general secretary, said some parts of the country were still suffering.

‘For families suffering the misery of unemployment, any decrease will be welcome news, but it is clear when you look at the bigger economic picture that any talk of growth is premature.

‘In areas such as Yorkshire and Humberside, and the West Midlands - where unemployment is already among the highest in the UK - unemployment continues to go up, meaning yet more misery for families struggling to get by.’

The number of people working part-time but who say they want to work full time is at a new all time high of 1,424,000, the IPPR think tank said.

Tony Dolphin, IPPR chief economist, said: 'Despite improvements in the overall 
employment rate, long-term unemployment has hit a 16 year high remains a
 serious problem, with more than 900,000 people out of work for more 
than a year.

'The long-term unemployed should be offered a guaranteed job
 to make sure they don’t become permanently cut off from the jobs 
market.”
