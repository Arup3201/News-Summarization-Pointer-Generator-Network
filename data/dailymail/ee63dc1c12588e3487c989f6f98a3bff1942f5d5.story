A mysterious figure known as the 'mountain man' has been caught on surveillance camera after police believe he is now responsible for at least two dozen armed burglaries.  

Troy James Knapp, 44, was spotted in Sanpete County, Utah a
week ago with a gun slung over his shoulder, using binoculars to scope 
for an alarm system at a cabin near Gooseberry Reservoir before breaking in.

The recluse was only identified in February, three years after his fingerprints were lifted from holiday 
homes near Zion National Park in the Utah wilderness. It is believed that he has been stealing camping equipment, guns and supplies from cabins for the past seven years.

Mountain mystery: A man believed to be serial burglar and expert survivalist Troy James Knapp was caught on CCTV last week in Sanpete County, Utah

Roaming: The 'mountain man' was spotted on CCTV in Sanpete County, Utah last week but once again police have failed to track down the expert survivalist

Last week, police tried once again to track him down but the survivalist evaded authorities.

He has been compared to Davy 
Crockett, the 19th century Tennessean known as 'King of 
the Wild Frontier', and he remains somewhere in 1,000 sq miles of 
wilderness.

Knapp is a 
virtual ghost in the woods, stocked with stolen gear, food and guns. 
Authorities have so far revealed little about him or how he ended up 
wandering the mountains of southern Utah.

Knapp has family members in Moscow, Idaho, but they have not commented.

Police
fear now that elk hunting season is under way, Knapp will find it 
easier to blend in with others in the woods and move around undetected, 
according to Deseret News.

One hunter, who is believed to have bumped into Knapp in June, asked him his name and was simply told: 'The Mountain'.

Mysterious: Investigators have found abandoned camps in the Utah wilderness, like the one pictured, dozens of guns, high-end outdoor gear stolen from the homes and rubbish strewn around the forest floor

Charges were filed against Knapp in Kane County, Utah on January 27 as the key suspect in 
a series of burglaries.

Knapp's
fingerprints, taken from one cabin in 2009, were allegedly matched
to a 2000 theft arrest in California. He was convicted previously on 
charges of assault with a weapon and burglaries

‘This guy is probably about as true a 
survivalist as Davy Crockett,’ U.S. Marshal Michael Wingert said at the time.

Comparison: Authorities say Knapp is like Davy Crockett, a 19th century survival expert portrayed by Fess Parker in the 1955 Disney film given his name

Anyone with information has been asked to contact authorities.

Detectives have warned the public not to approach Knapp but to take a photo of him and note his GPS coordinates.

Knapp is 5ft 11', weighs 160lb, has blue eyes and short, red hair. He has tattoos on his neck, chest, arms and back of his left hand.

In December 2011, photos were taken of a sandy-haired man in camouflage on snowshoes, a rifle slung over his shoulder, believed to be Knapp.

It is thought that the expert woodsman has spent around seven years breaking into cabins in winter, living off hot food, 
alcohol and coffee before stealing provisions and vanishing away with guns and supplies.

In
February, it took detectives an entire day to reach a remote cabin 
after getting a report that lights had been seen on inside overnight. 

It
turned out they were solar-powered lights on the porch, and the cabin 
was empty - another dead-end. But their break came in January 2012 with the 
fingerprint match.

There 
have been no violent confrontations but detectives call Knapp a time bomb.
He has left some cabins tidy and clean, but others practically 
destroyed - defecating in a pan on the floor in one home.

Lately
he has been leaving the cabins in disarray and riddled with bullets 
after defacing religious icons. A recent note left behind in one cabin 
warned: ‘Get off my mountain.’

In
the January 27 court filing, authorities said Knapp had left behind 
even more threatening notes aimed at law enforcement. ‘Hey Sheriff... 
Gonna put you in the ground!’ read one note.

From the beginning, the suspect's lore 
grew, leading to theories that he might have been two separate men on 
the FBI's Most Wanted List.

It was even suggested he could be a 
castaway from nearby compounds of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus 
Christ of Latter Day Saints, the polygamous sect run by jailed leader 
Warren Jeffs.

Early on, investigators thought his 
unattended camps they came across during their search were left 
behind by ‘doomsday’ believers preparing for some sort of apocalypse.

This
was because of the remote locations and supplies like dozens of guns, 
radios, batteries, dehydrated food and camping gear. They now have a 
name, but the man remains in the mist.
