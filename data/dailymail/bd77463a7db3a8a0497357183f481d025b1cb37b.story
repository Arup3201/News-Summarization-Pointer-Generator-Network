A 40-year murder mystery has taken another dramatic twist with sensational new claims the victim's husband confessed to the triple killing on his deathbed.

Queensland Police are investigating whether Bill McCulkin admitted shortly before he died in 2011 to killing his wife, Barbara, 34, and their two daughters, Vicki, 13, and Leanne, 11.

Mrs McCulkin and her daughters disappeared from their Brisbane home in January 1974, and have not been seen since.

The case has become one of Australia's most enduring cold-case mysteries.

But a major break may have come in the case recenty, when a witness to McCulkin's alleged confession gave a statement to police.

Police are trying to reconcile inconsistencies between the supposed confession and the other clues in the investigation and the conclusions detectives have reached previously.

McCulkin, a petty gangster, reportedly took up with another woman just two months before his former partner and her girls disappeared. He was initially a suspect, but was later cleared of being involved in the crime.

The court was told the motive for the killings was allegedly that Barbara McCulkin knew too much about the gang’s involvement in the Torino’s Nightclub fire, according to the Courier Mail.

Crown prosecutor David Meredith argued Barbara’s loose lips were proof of motive for murder.

Dubois and O'Dempsey face three counts of murder and deprivation of liberty. They are due back in court later this month.
