Burnley boss Sean Dyche has warned Sunderland fans not to expect an easy ride at Turf Moor on Saturday.

Both sides are awaiting their first victories of the season, meaning there is plenty riding on their meeting this weekend.

For Dyche's men a season of struggle was always anticipated, but the Black Cats harbour higher hopes than a repeat of the relegation battle of last term.

Away fans will see their trip to Lancashire as a big chance to get up and running, but Dyche has other ideas.

'Lots of Sunderland supporters will expect their team to beat us, and that does probably add a bit of weight to the game from their point of view,' he said.

'But I think that does us down a bit. Our record speaks for itself at Turf Moor, where we're pretty handy.

'I certainly don't think we're a team where you can just walk into Turf Moor and think it will all work out happily for you.

'You have to earn that right, certainly here, and I don't think Gus Poyet is naive enough to think otherwise.

'Some of their fans might think 'we've got to beat Burnley, simple as that' but I don't think it's that easy.'

Dyche sees the fixture as a close call, one of several he is expecting against teams who exist outside the rarefied air of the Champions League positions.

'There's a reality to this division that suggests there's five or six - maybe seven or eight at most - who are right up there pushing, and outside of that there are ups and downs, moments of chaos,' he said.

'We're in that and we know it.

'I don't think Sunderland are market leaders either, like we're not, because there's only a small handful of teams who are up there at the very top.

'There's a bigger group of teams who are up and down, in and out, where it's wins, draws and losses.

'You can't really put them (Sunderland) in a box but the fact is they're fighting to improve and challenging themselves to win games.

'Last year the main thing for Gus and his men was to get over the line and they did it.'

One side who left Burnley with less than they hoped for this season were Manchester United.

Louis van Gaal's side laboured to a 0-0 draw, the first of consecutive clean sheets for the Clarets.

And that is a point of some pride for right-back Kieran Trippier.

'We're delighted with the two clean sheets in succession as a back five, including the goalkeeper Tom Heaton, and hopefully we can take that into the weekend,' he said.

'Last year we had the best defensive record in the Championship and hopefully we can try and do something similar this year.'
