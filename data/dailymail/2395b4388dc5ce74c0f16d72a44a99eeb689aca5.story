It wouldn't win a beauty contest, but a Chinese scientist claims an ancient fish has the world's first face and it challenges current thinking on the history of human evolution.

A newly-discovered fossil of Entelognathus - Greek for 'complete jaw' - was dug up in Yunnan in south west China and is the most primitive vertebrate to have a modern jaw.

The ancient creature was about eight inches long and swam in the prehistoric seas 419 million years ago.

It belonged to a group of early fish known as placoderms that had bony armour, or plates, on their heads and necks.

The 419-million-year-old fossil (inset) is prompting scientists to rethink how the living groups of jawed vertebrates acquired their characteristic features

The superbly preserved specimen shows its jaw is much more like that of a modern bony fish - offering a new perspective on early evolution

But the superbly preserved specimen shows its jaw is much more like that of a modern bony fish, offering a new perspective on early evolution.

The gap between jawed and jawless vertebrates is so large that it is hard to work out the individual steps in the transition.

This creature described in the journal Nature brings scientists closer to understanding when modern jawed animals with backbones such as sharks and bony fish emerged from a collection of jawed, armoured placoderms.

Jaws enabled vertebrates to become predators; an important step in the development of complex forms such as humans.

Entelognathus had jaw bone features previously restricted to bony fish called osteichthyans, as well as full body armour seen in placoderms.

Professor Min Zhu, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, said: 'Until now jaw bones have never been found in any placoderms.'

Sluggish placoderms are believed to have become extinct due to competition from the swifter bony fish and early sharks.

Dr Matt Friedman, of Oxford University and Dr Martin Brazeau, of Imperial College London, reviewed the study for the journal and said it challenges the view that the most recent common ancestor of jawed vertebrates resembled modern sharks.

They believe it provides compelling evidence for the evolutionary link between placoderms and osteichthyans and adjusts our understanding of early evolution.

The palaeontologists said: 'Jawed vertebrates - or gnathostomes - comprise the vast majority of back-boned animals.

'Understanding their great success and the evolution of their anatomical marvels lies in reconstructing the nature of their most recent common ancestor.

'An entrenched assumption of classical comparative anatomy, which has gained some recent palaeontological support, is this precursor resembled a shark.

'Entelognathus demands a major rethink of where fossils fit relative to modern lineages and how these living groups came to acquire their characteristic traits.

'It will take time to fully digest the implications of such a remarkable fossil but it's clear a major re-framing of our understanding of early gnathostome evolution is now in full swing.'

The first four-legged animals colonised land 400 million years ago after fish fins evolved into limbs allowing them to crawl out of the water.

But it took them another 80 million years to lose their fishy heads.

Major changes to the jaw only began around 320 million years ago - occurring mostly in reptiles.

The animals' early fish-like jaws were suited to tearing flesh rather than chewing plants.

It is believed that reptiles evolved their jaws only after they had mastered breathing using their ribs, allowing them to devote their mouths to chewing.
