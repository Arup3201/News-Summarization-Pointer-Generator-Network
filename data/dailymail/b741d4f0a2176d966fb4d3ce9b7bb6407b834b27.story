Whisper it, but Salford are starting to resemble genuine play-off contenders after cruising to a resounding 36-8 win over Widnes that lifted them to fourth place in Super League.

Booed from the field after their previous Thursday night television appearance resulted in a 52-6 thrashing by St Helens, the Red Devils received a standing ovation this time after running in seven tries against the team that beat them three times in 2014.

Close-season signings Cory Paterson, Scott Taylor, Liam Hood and Carl Forster all made a big impact as Marwan Koukash's hefty investment finally showed signs of starting to pay off.

The Vikings, who were without seven first-team regulars through injury, were simply no match for their classy hosts and they quickly found themselves 16-0 down.

Rangi Chase's clever kick produced a fourth-minute try for winger Ben Jones-Bishop - his fifth in as many games for the Red Devils - and second-rower Weller Hauraki touched down Michael Dobson's punt four minutes later.

Josh Griffin converted both to make it 12-0 inside 12 minutes and it got even better for the home side when a break from inside his own half by substitute hooker Hood got Dobson haring for the line.

Widnes centre Stefan Marsh got back to haul Dobson down just short of the line but he was sin-binned for holding on and Salford immediately made use of the extra man, with winger Greg Johnson collecting Chase's cut-out pass to score his side's third try.

The Vikings were not as bad as the 16-0 score suggested, however, and they struck back seven minutes before the break when winger Paddy Flynn accepted Rhys Hanbury's pass and wrong-footed full-back Kevin Locke to touch down.

Jack Owens kicked the conversion and added a penalty on the stroke of half-time to cut the Red Devils' lead to eight points.

Salford thought they had scored again four minutes into the second half when centre Mason Caton-Brown got on the end of Chase's kick but his try was disallowed following closer inspection by the video referee.

However, it was all Salford in the third quarter and, producing some of their best rugby of the season, they seized control of the game with two further tries in an ultimately decisive five-minute spell.

Prop Lama Tasi powered his way over from Chase's inside pass before second-rower Paterson jumped into dummy half to get Griffin over at the corner as the Red Devils stretched their lead to 26-8.

Widnes' injury problems worsened when Flynn hobbled off after appearing to pull a hamstring in full flight and they conceded two more tries in the final quarter.

Paterson collected Dobson's high kick to touch down and former Wigan prop Taylor proved unstoppable from 10 metres out as he registered his first try for the club.
