Federal treasurer Joe Hockey believed the May budget, which delivered huge cuts to welfare and education, was 'too soft' and he campaigned to make it even tougher.

Sources inside the budget meetings claimed that Mr Hockey pushed for tougher budget measures during meetings, but was stymied by Prime Minister Tony Abbott who wanted to adopt a 'more cautious' approach.

The revelations have come from a new biography of Joe Hockey, released today, Hockey: Not Your Average Joe, written by Fairfax and ABC journalist Madonna King with the cooperation of Mr Hockey.

Joe Hockey wanted the government's budget to be even tougher than it was, according to a new biography of the treasurer released today

A source told Ms King: '[The budget] wasn't as tough as Joe would have liked but a good compromise. Maybe it's tougher than the Prime Minister would do if Joe wasn't there to drive it,' the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

King wrote: 'In reality, the budget was much softer than Joe would have liked. He wanted changes to pensions made earlier and the deficit levy to net more taxpayers … But Abbott, who chaired each of the expenditure review committee meetings, was taking a much more cautious approach than his Treasurer, no doubt with one eye firmly on the reaction of voters.'

At the moment a two percent deficit levy applies to people with incomes over $180,000, but the book claims the government considered imposing the deficit levy on incomes more than $80,000.

Joe Hockey is revealed in the book as Tony Abbott's likely successor, with the prime minister's chief of staff Peta Credlin telling Ms King that the treasurer has 'got his head above every other contender', the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Do you think the federal budget was tough enough?

The May budget, which contained a raft of unpopular measures, including a proposed Medicare co-payment, raising the retirement age, and the deregulation of university fees, is widely considered responsible for the dramatic slump in popularity of Mr Abbott and his government.

A Newspoll published by The Australian earlier this month found that Bill Shorten had a 10-point lead on Tony Abbott as preferred prime minister, with 44 percent  saying they would rather the Labor leader was in charge, compared to only 34 percent preferring Mr Abbott.

The poll also showed that if the election were held today Labor would win, with the ALP scoring 55 percent of the two-party-preferred vote, compared to 45 percent for the Coalition, almost a complete reversal of the election results last September.
