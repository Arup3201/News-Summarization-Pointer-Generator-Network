'The residence has been declared a crime scene and investigations are continuing,' a police spokesman told AAP.

He said there was no other information available.

Forensic and homicide officers are currently at the scene of the suspected murder and two people are being questioned by police.

The entire street is now on lockdown.

A neighbour on the street, Linda Bright, told the Brisbane Times: 'It's normally a pretty quiet house... You never really see much movement or never really see people coming in or out.
