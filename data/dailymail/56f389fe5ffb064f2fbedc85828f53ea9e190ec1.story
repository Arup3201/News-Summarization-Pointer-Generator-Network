Home Secretary Theresa May announced the UK Border Agency would be split into two after acknowledging it was 'not good enough'

An Iranian convict with no permission to be in Britain is fighting to stay because of human rights legislation, despite racking up 40 offences including theft and assault.

Davodreza Abasbahi-Gotti, 37, came to the UK in 2002 and has already had 18 convictions and has served three prison sentences during that time.

His crimes include assaulting a police officer, theft, and driving while disqualified on multiple occasions.

He has also been convicted for driving without tax or insurance numerous times, according to the Sunday Times.

Abasbahi-Gotti has launched a legal bid to be allowed to stay in Britain because he is a drug addict and suffers depression stemming from developed adjustment disorder.

Legal-aid funded lawyers acting for the criminal said he has 'psychiatric medical conditions including a dependency disorder on opiates', although it is not clear whether the drugs are prescribed or illegal substances.

The human rights claim is his second attempt to be allowed to stay in Britain after the 37-year-old initially argued deportation would breach his right for respect to private and family life.

But it emerged last week that he lied about having a wife and two children here and in fact only has three siblings who arrived less than two years ago.

Abasbahi-Gotti, who lives in a tax-payer funded house in Uxbridge, west London, expressed his gratitude to the government for supporting him during his legal battle to remain in the UK.

'They are looking after me very good. They gave me a house and they look after me,' he said.

Muslim Cleric Abu Qatada has avoided deportation again in his latest appeal

Abasbahi-Gotti admits most of his 40 offences committed over his decade in the UK but denied the assault charge claiming the injury occurred when he was evading arrest.

'They tried to catch me and I ran away and the police officer he fell down and they were saying to me "You assaulted a police officer".'

Abasbahi-Gotti is said to have used more than 20 aliases since arriving in the UK, but says this was because of repeated spelling mistakes by police.

Abasbahi-Gotti is one of 4,000 foreign 
criminals living in the UK who are thought to be using human rights laws
to fight deportation.

The Home Secretary Theresa May announced last week that the UK Border Agency would be split into two parts after acknowledging its performance was 'not good enough.'

A report by MPs said the backlog of immigration cases would take 24 years to clear if the rate of dealing with claims stays the same.

Theresa May lost her latest battle to have hate preacher Abu Qatada deported to Jordan after the ruling of an earlier immigration court was enforced saying he must be allowed to stay.
