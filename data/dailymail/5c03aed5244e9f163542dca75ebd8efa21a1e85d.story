Council tenants are going to be paid for doing their own DIY jobs from next month.

In a scheme that is sure to anger many private homeowners who struggle to find time for their own repairs, council tenants stand to pocket up to £500 a year for carrying out simple repairs like decorating, fixing leaky taps, and fitting doors instead of calling maintenance staff, they could stand to pocket up to £500 a year.

The scheme, Tenant Cashback  is part of Housing minister Grant Shapps' vision to help cut the  £4billion-a-year maintenance bill for social housing.

Pay out: If tenants carry out basic repairs like painting, instead of calling maintenance staff, they could stand to pocket up to £500 a year under the Tenant Cashback scheme

He said the scheme could allow their tenants the opportunity to become 'apprentices in the home'.

Mr Shapps said: 'Rather than having to wait for landlords to act, tenants should be able to tackle their own DIY dilemmas — and get paid for it.

'For some, this could even serve as an apprenticeship in the home and the start on a path to a whole new career.

'This, combined with the potential to bring the local community together to improve the local area, means all councils and housing associations should give residents the right to take up tools.'

They will be invited to undertake basic training programmes to increase their job prospects.

Social housing landlords are responsible for more than four million homes, and spend an average of £1,000 per property annually on repairs.

Community groups can take on repairs for their local area and help neighbours who are unable to fix things themselves.

But the news of the scheme has already infuriated homeowners.

On an internet forum, one disgruntled user wrote:

I am a homeowner and massively in debt, and I can't even afford to fix my broken fence - why should they be paid using my taxes for doing basic repairs?'

Another user commented:

This is really not fair at all. I have to save up to the kid's bedrooms as well as paying my mortgage - why should they get it all for free?'

The Tenant Participation Advisory Service has given the idea cautious support.

‘I am a big fan of anything that encourages people to do things for themselves, because I think it delivers value for money,’ said Nigel Long, head of policy at TPAS to Inside Housing.

However, the scheme has been greeted with some industry scepticism.

Concerns
have been raised such as the potential risks to health and safety, the 
quality of repairs undertaken,and legal and insurance implications.

Three
social landlords - Home Group, Together Housing and Bromford Group have already begun pilot schemes.

Home Group, is offering its tenants tailored DIY courses at a B&Q training centre.

Some
tenants on the Bromford scheme are receiving one to one advice on 
maintaining their homes and tenants have provided videos with hints to 
help their neighbours get started.

Vision: Grant Shapps said the scheme could allow their tenants the opportunity to become 'apprentices in the home' and they will be invited to undertake basic training programmes to increase their job prospects

Anne Imeson, a 67-year old Home Group tenant from Middlesbrough, has taken part.

She told Inside Housing: 'We were all given leaflets about what the pilot scheme contained and what we had to do. I couldn’t believe people called the housing association’s repairs service out to put light bulbs in. The majority of work on this pilot I was doing anyway.'

To ensure tenants do not make claims for repair work they have not carried out, two of the pilots schemes, decided not to pay per repair.

Instead, participants are rewarded in
lump sums for maintaining their properties to a mutually agreed 
standard and regular checks are carried out to ensure the tenant is upholding their end of the agreement.

Yesterday it was revealed homeowners face having to pay up to £735 per year more after Halifax said today they are hiking up their mortgage rates - sparking the threat of a mass customer exodus.

The bank is increasing its standard variable rate mortgage from 3.5 per cent to 3.99 per cent from May 1, costing 850,000 customers hundreds of pounds per year.

Other lenders are likely to follow suit and increase their charges - despite the Bank of England base rate being held at a historic low of 0.5per cent for three years.

The increase, which is the first for three years, will be seen as rank profiteering by homeowners.

However, the banks are blaming a rise in the cost of borrowing money on the wholesale markets in the last year for the rises.

The changes come as hard-pressed families are being hit by record-breaking petrol prices and an unprecedented squeeze on household spending.

The announcement comes just months 
after a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies said middle-income 
families are suffering an ‘unprecedented collapse’ in living standards 
as inflation and poor wages wipe thousands off incomes.

The IFS has found families are about to endure their biggest income drop since the 1970s.
