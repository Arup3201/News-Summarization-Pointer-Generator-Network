A couple who got engaged during a hot air balloon ride have had a lucky escape after their romantic ride turned to terror when the balloon crashed.

Stephen Richardson and Brandi Runyan were among seven passengers aboard a hot air balloon that crashed into live power lines in Noblesville, Indiana on Saturday night.

Richardson was overjoyed when his girlfriend of two-and-a-half years accepted his proposal and they posed happily for pictures as they soared over fields below.

Excitement: Stephen Richardson proposed to Brandi Runyan aboard a hot air balloon on Saturday

Oops: But later that evening, the hot air balloon hit live power lines, sending their romantic ride to the ground in a fiery crash. The couple - nor their 5 fellow passengers - did not sustain any injuries

But the passengers were suddenly blinded by a huge explosion as they hit power lines, before the ripped balloon began descending amid billowing black smoke.

A passerby happened to be filming the balloon when it hit the power lines - revealing the massive burst of light before the basket came down in a field.

'I don't know if it was wind conditions or what,' Richardson told ABC News. 'We knew we were going down and we saw the power lines coming right at us.

'When we hit, the pilot told us to get down. All we saw were sparks all around us, and felt the sparks. We were all in shock and fear.'

Blinding: After the explosion of light, the balloon deflated and fell to the ground in a cloud of black smoke

Despite the terrifying burst of light seen in the footage, there were no serious injuries.

Several homes and businesses in the area lost power because of the collision with the power lines.

The balloon had departed from Harbour Shores church in Noblesville and went down in the area of 16th and Pleasant Street.

A small fire was reported at the scene and was quickly extinguished.

Fire officers later snapped an image of the deflated balloon on the grass in the open field, while the lucky couple pouted in front of the flames for another picture.

Memories: They kept a fragment of the balloon to remember the harrowing but happy trip

But Richardson and Runyan said they don't consider the crash a bad omen - just a good story.

'She wanted a story and she got one,' Richardson said. 'Especially after this, we'll just keep it simple.'

The FAA is investigating the cause of the
 crash, and the hot air balloon company, Midwest Balloon Rides of 
Fishers, Indiana, said that the incident is under review.
