It is the most successful animated film of all time. 

And one family has found a way to cash in on Frozen's popularity - by making song-cover videos.

Robbie Bagley, 22, and his siblings, from Utah, earn a staggering $10,000 a month from their own versions of the Disney movie's hits, including 'Love Is An Open Door' and 'In Summer'.

Their most successful video to date is 'Do You Want To Build A Snowman?', which features eight-year-old Mia Bagley as lonely 'Anna' and has gained more than 90million views on YouTube.

Although many people have seen their Frozen song covers take off on the video-sharing site this year, Mr Bagley took the further step of negotiating with Disney for copyright licenses.

Under the deal - of which, the exact details remain unknown - the family nets thousands of dollars in revenue every month, according to Yahoo.

Mr Bagley, a filmmaker who runs a production crew called Working With Lemons, started making videos in high school using 'a $150 camera and a Mac'.

He decided to film a cover of 'Do You Want To Build A Snowman?' - featuring Mia and their 14-year-old sister, Ariana, as an older Anna - earlier this year following Frozen's  release  in November 2013.

Bored: 'I thought my sister Mia pretty much looks exactly like that Anna girl,' he told KSL. 'We just thought, "Let's just try it."' Above, Mia (left) and Anna (right) wave their feet in front of a clock as they pass the time

'Tick tock, tick tock': To create the video, Ms Bourne sewed costumes for Mia - such as this one, pictured - and Ariana, while Mr Bagley sorted out the recording and audio and his talented sisters rehearsed their lines

Her animated counterpart: To record the girls' singing, the family used a microphone from the video game 'Rock Band'. Above, a teenage Anna follows the clock's hand with her eyes while lying on the ground

'I thought my sister Mia pretty much looks exactly like that Anna girl,' he told KSL, adding that his mother, Jeane Bourne, felt the same. 'We just thought, "Let's just try it."'

To create the video, Ms Bourne sewed costumes for Mia and Ariana, while Mr Bagley sorted out the recording and audio and his sisters rehearsed their lines.

To record the girls' singing, the family used a microphone from the video game 'Rock Band,' free software on Garage Band, a 'pop filter' constructed from a hanger and some nylon tights.  

'It's crazy, we really are doing it with nothing,' Ms Bourne told Deseret News earlier this year. 'But we've just been amazed with how things have turned out. Much better, really, than we expected.'

Sad: In the film, the older Anna sings to her sister through her bedroom door following their parents' funeral

Another popular cover: In May this year, Mr Bagley posted a version of 'Love Is an Open Door' (pictured) - featuring Mia and their brother, Anson - to the site. It has now been viewed more than 45million times

Enamored: In this movie still, Anna and Prince Hans dance and become engaged after meeting at the palace

After the video was uploaded to the family's YouTube channel,  'Working With Lemons', in March, it quickly gained attention from users across the world. 

Two months later, Mr Bagley posted a version of 'Love Is an Open Door' - featuring Mia and their brother, Anson - to the site. It has now been viewed more than 45million times. 

Mr Bagley and his siblings reportedly plan to release a cover of 'Let it Go' in the next few months.

Frozen, featuring Kristen Bell as Anna and Idina Menzel as Elsa, the 21-year-old Snow Queen of Arendelle and Anna's sister, gained nearly $1.3billion in worldwide box office revenue.
