Dozens of squatters were evicted by bailiffs from former TV offices in central London today.

The group of around 40 people had been squatting at a building off Tottenham Court Road and had been calling themselves Love Activists - a group known to campaign about the rising number of homeless people. 

Around 20 former residents of the Rathbone Place building, which used to be home to the offices of the Nickelodeon TV channel, were seen arguing with bailiffs as they were told to leave the building.

Squatters argued with bailiffs as they were evicted from the former Nickelodeon offices in London today 

Love Activists had previously occupied the former Royal Bank of Scotland building in London in December before they were kicked out on Christmas Eve. They had pledged to make Christmas dinner for homeless people at the site and despite being evicted returned to the site on Christmas Day. 

They moved to Arthur Stanley House, a former hospital building in Tottenham Street, in late December but were evicted without warning on January 5. 

As the latest eviction took place around 20 people carrying sleeping bags and dressed in heavy coats stood outside the building arguing with bailiffs.

Some hooded activists wearing scarves across their faces banged on the windows and shouted abuse at three bailiffs standing inside.

An ex-soldier among the evicted squatters said: 'We've been here a couple of weeks, I'm not sure how long.

'The bailiffs were really brutal. They've just been really heavy-handed. One girl got hit on the head and another guy got hit on the knee.

Squatters were seen arguing with bailiffs and police as they were evicted from the site 

'This morning I went to go and get some breakfast around Tottenham Court Road and when I got back the building was sealed off.

'There was a bailiff standing outside saying "you're not getting in." I was heartbroken - it's a case of moving every couple of weeks.

'I'm an ex soldier. I was in the Army for seven years. I went to Iraq and then these bailiffs treat us like animals. It's disgusting.

'There are two ex soldiers in this building. There were disabled people here.

'I've been squatting for over a month - there's just nowhere to stay and renting isn't an option. It's soul destroying. It's all we've got.'

The squatters called themselves Love Activists - who also took over an old RBS building before Christmas 

The former soldier said he had got evicted two weeks ago and was now looking at sleeping on the street again, as forecasters predict snow could reach London by the end of the week. 

Police were on hand to help bailiffs, who had an order from the owner of the building to remove the squatters. No arrests were made. 

A female squatter, who did not want to be named, said: 'A bailiff hit my head and then a policeman dragged me out as if I was a towel or something.

'It's appalling. I still feel dazed and in shock. He was shouting and I kept telling him to leave me alone.'

The building has been empty since 2012 when Nickelodeon moved out to new offices in Camden Town. 

Planning permission has been granted to demolish the Rathbone Place building and develop new commercial premises at the site, which is understood to be owned by Royal London Property. MailOnline has contacted the company for comment.
