She's famous for her simple sporting attire of hot pants, trainers and a a tiny Team GB sports vest.

But gold medal-winning Olympian heptathlete Jessica Ennis, 26, has revealed a desire to now launch her own fashion label.

And the champion heptathlete from Sheffield, a contender for the upcoming Sports Personality Of The Year, has referenced designers Alexander McQueen and Victoria Beckham as her style influences.

Speaking exclusively to City AM's glossy magazine, Bespoke, out now, the petite, 5ft 5in sports whizz said: 'I'd love to start my own 
fashion label. Whether it's collaborating with [a big sportswear brand] 
or doing the more fashiony side of things.'

Ennis explained that ever since her moment of glory in London this summer, she has been inundated with invitations to fashion parties, runway shows and award ceremonies. And she has now developed a taste for sparkly, designer dresses.

Explaining her easy transition from tracksuits to luxury clobber, much of which she is sent by design houses eager to have the British hero pictured in their brands, Ennis said: 'It's a brilliant position to be in. It's nice to have the option to pick and choose - it's less stressful when you're deciding what to wear.'

Describing her style as simple and everyday, Ennis says she is a 'skinny jeans girl'. And she certainly has the figure for them.

Discussing her size, the Adidas-sponsored athlete (who was spotted in the front row of catwalk shows including Mulberry during London Fashion Week) said she 'was always pretty skinny', but that 'doing athletics has given me some shape'.

Speaking about the attention she has 
been getting since her Olympic win this summer, Ennis - who is rumoured to have earned £1m in endorsement deals with Adidas and Olay alone in the run-up to the Games - said: 'It's really busy now. Busier than I'd ever imagined - I'm having to say no to quite a lot of companies who want to work with me. It's a brilliant position to be in.

Since her big summer, Ennis has signed lucrative contracts with Aviva, Jaguar, Powerade and British Airways.

'It’s really 
weird. It was such a big build up to the Olympics and the pressure kind 
of piled on me but I literally wouldn’t have changed anything.

'The whole build up was brilliant but when you actually achieve it, your goal, your dream, it’s a strange feeling.'
