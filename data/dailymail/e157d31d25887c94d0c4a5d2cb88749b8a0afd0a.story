From Damien Hirst sacrificing 9,000 butterflies to Tracey Emin scrawling the names of every one of her lovers onto a tent, some artists make a living out of pushing boundaries.

But one young artist has pushed them to a whole new level after mastering the art of regurgitation to create colourful, abstract canvases.

Millie Brown, 26, drinks milk tinted with vivid dyes before regurgitating the liquid over a large canvas or white clothing and recording the process on camera.

Quirky: Young artist Millie Brown has taught herself how to regurgitate paint to create quirky canvas art

Up for grabs: One of Brown's unique vomit-art canvases will be available for purchase and many maintain that now is a great time to invest in this hotly tipped artist

A famous fan of Millie's - unsurprisingly - is Lady Gaga, who personally chose the artist to feature 
in her own performance video.

Millie can be seen vomiting shimmering turquoise liquid over the 
singer in Lary Gaga's pop music video, Exorcist Interlude.

Beautiful creation: Critics have noted the abstract beauty of the finished canvases, created when Millie drinks milk tinted with dyes

Abstract: Millie's work has been likened to Jackson Pollock

And now, Millie is debuting her work in the show Muted Chronology at the Strand Gallery in London.

Bohemian: Sleeping in abandoned buildings and driving around Europe in trucks became part of her everyday adventures

Whilst some may find her work disturbing, critics have noted the abstract beauty of the finished canvases - she has even been likened to Jackson Pollock, who was well known for his unique style of drip painting.

Alongside the video installation, one of her unique vomit-art canvases will be available for purchase and many maintain that now is a great time to invest in this hotly tipped artist.

Born in England to Bohemian parents and spending much of her youth in Spain and the South of France, it is clear where Millieâ€™s maverick tendencies originated.

Aged 13 and unable to relate the French children of her neighborhood, Millie befriended local street punks.

From then on, sleeping in abandoned buildings and driving around Europe in trucks became part of her everyday adventures.

After
 a brief summer stint in L.A., Millie returned to London at the age of 
17 where she embarked upon her artistic journey in performance art and 
film.

Speaking about her quirky work, she said: 'I have an inherent desire to push my own boundaries within my art.

'By
 creating art from the very depths of my own physical being I am able to
 challenge people's perception of beauty, expressing raw elements of 
human nature and in turn challenging myself both physically and 
mentally.'
