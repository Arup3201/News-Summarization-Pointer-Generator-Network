Energy giant SSE today denied putting profits before customers as it announced inflation-busting increased payouts to shareholders days before it hikes prices.

The firm made profits of £354 million in just six months but dismissed accusations of greed from ministers, insisting that ‘nothing could be further from the truth’.

But it announced a 3.2 per cent increase in interim 
dividend payments to investors, as it prepares to put up prices by 8.2 per cent from this Friday.

Profits: Energy giant SSE revealed a loss in its retail business but still posted total profits of £354million in six months

SSE was the first of the Big Six suppliers to announce its price hike for this winter, blaming wholesale price rises, increasing costs of delivering gas and electricity to homes and green levies.

Most of the other big firms have announced increase up more than eight or nine per cent, but yesterday French-owned EDF Energy announced its bills will go up by just 3.9 per cent.

The National Audit Office warned today that energy and water bills are set to rise faster than inflation and wages for the next 17 years, to pay for extra investment.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey yesterday took aim at greedy energy bosses, likening them to bankers responsible for the financial crash.

Co-operative Energy has scaled back a planned price increase amid expectations that the Government will axe green levies from bills.

The supplier said its tariff increase will reduce from an average of 4.5 per cent to 2 per cent, while regional variations in prices mean that more than half of its 150,000 customers will now see no hike at all.

Co-op Energy, which launched in 2011, said its decision was in response to the 'clear indication that the Government has given that it will remove the mandatory Energy Companies Obligation (ECO) green taxes on gas and electricity bills'.

'Those profits cannot come at the expense of the elderly, the vulnerable and the poorest in our society,’ he said.

'Customers are not just cash cows to be squeezed in the pursuit of a higher return for shareholders.’

But SSE insisted it was not prioritising shareholders, as it announced the increase in interim dividend payments to investors.

Will Morris, group managing director 
of SSE's retail business, said: ‘Some politicians and media commentators
have claimed recently that we value our shareholders more than our 
customers.

‘Or to put it 
another way, we're focussed on paying them a dividend on their shares, 
regardless of what that means for our customers. Nothing could be 
further from the truth.’

He 
added: ‘Without the investment made by shareholders, we couldn't afford 
to build the infrastructure or buy the equipment needed to deliver what 
customers need.’

Rising gas 
and electricity bills have dominated the political agenda in recent 
weeks after five of the ‘big six’ suppliers have upped tariffs.

The firm revealed overall underlying group profits fell 11.7 per cent to £354 million in the six months to September 30.

It made a first half loss of £115million in its retail supply arm compares with a £48.3 million operating profit a year earlier.

How bills will soar

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'Despite
reporting losses on its domestic supply business, SSE as a group is in 
profit and awarded above inflation dividend payments to shareholders.

'This will be of little comfort to their customers who were hit by an 
average price rise of 8.2 per cent only last month.

'It's time for the 
Government to turn up the heat on the energy companies and deliver the 
radical changes that people need. George Osborne should use his Autumn 
Statement to cut the Big Six down to size and to cut the cost of 
Government energy policies to consumers.'

Tom
Greatrex, Labour's shadow energy minister, said: 'Just days before 
their price hike hits millions of households, these profits and the 
above inflation rise in dividends to shareholders raise yet more 
questions about whether this market is really working for consumers.

William Morris, managing director of SSE, denied putting profits before customers

'Labour's price freeze will save money for 27 million homes and 2.4 million businesses and our reforms will deliver fairer prices in the future.'

SSE - which trades as Southern Electric, Swalec and Scottish Hydro - also revealed falling electricity and gas consumption in the half year, down 3 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively on average with weather effects stripped out.

The group's customer numbers also dropped by 60,000 to 9.41 million since the end of March.

Lord Smith of Kelvin, chairman of SSE, said: ‘Energy market conditions generally have been difficult for some time.’

SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies called for green levies to be paid for by general taxation, which he said would reduce bills by £110 immediately.

The group vowed to reduce its bills if the levies were cut, telling BBC Radio 5 Live that prices would definitely come down as a result, ‘no ifs, no buts’.

SSE's retail division contributes around 13 per cent of the overall company's results, with the rest coming from its energy networks and generation capacity.

Including one-off items, the group reported pre-tax profits of £336.4 million for the half-year.

The group said it deployed more than 1,100 engineers and support staff to make repairs after last month's St Jude's storm when around 110,000 of its customers were left without power.
