Philadelphia may be known as the city of brotherly love, but it’s a different kind of love that a scheming mom has posted an ad for in the ‘casual encounters’ section of the local Craigslist personals.

The advert was placed on July 16 with the provocative title of ‘Sugar baby for my son’ and the mom goes on to explain that she is looking for a young woman, under 19 years old, willing to turn her boy into a man. There is no proof that the plea is real, however.

The upfront mom - who doesn't give her name or say what her son is called - explains that her 18-year-old son is a senior in High School and will be going away to Harvard in the fall.

Although he is ‘extremely smart,’ his mom is concerned that he has ‘never had a girlfriend’ and is probably a virgin.

Her offer which is open to any Philly-based woman aged 19 or younger is simple – ‘I want to find a cute young girl to date him and turn him from high school nerd to cool college kid,’ she explains.

She describes her boy as ‘very handsome and extremely fit,’ as well as being on the varsity cross country team, she claims he has almost zero body fat.

The scheming mom – who sounds like she might consider Kris Jenner an inspiration – then suggests an elaborate staged situation where the chosen girl would get to hook-up with her nerdy but needy son.

She has even hatched a plan to make it 
seem like the fake meeting is perfectly natural and not at all 
preplanned just so her son can be deflowered.

The calculating mom is willing to buy four tickets to a concert and then given two to her son and two to the chosen vixen.

‘He'll go to the show with one of his buddies (no way he'll take a girl, he's to (sic) shy to ask them out) and you and your friend will be in the seats next to them,’ she writes.

Then the chosen girl will ‘spring into action’, start talking to her boy during the concert and will ‘eventually pick him up.’

The conniving mom has a very clear idea of how this first date should end. 

‘Ask him to take you somewhere after and ditch your friends. Then you seduce him and take his virginity,’ she writes.

The bizarre request was posted on July 16 in the 'casual encounters' section of Craigslist in Philadelphia

And it doesn’t end there, the future monster-in-law anticipates the fake relationship lasting beyond one night.

She write that she wants the chosen girl to keep dating him and ‘showing him different sex positions’ until he goes to college.

At that stage the scheming mom wants the women to gently let her boy go ‘so he'll have the confidence to date other girls once he's there.’

What a proposal, and in return the mom promises she’ll make the chosen girl’s ‘financial issues disappear’ and suggests the lucky girl may even get the car of her choice.

‘Please put your favorite type of car in the subject, to show that you're real,’ she writes.
