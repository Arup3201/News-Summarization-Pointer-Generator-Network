Accusations: Dr Robert Brown, pictured, fell for one of his patients after they started chatting about Monty Python, a hearing heard today

A married GP fell for one of his patients after they started chatting about Monty Python, a hearing heard today.

Dr Richard Brown first met the woman while working at the Uplands and Mumbles Surgery in Swansea, south Wales, in 2010.

The patient, a diabetic mother-of-three, was suffering from depression and the GP arranged for her to have counselling.

The two bonded when they realised they both had three daughters and were fans of Monty Python, the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service heard.

But the relationship broke down when Dr Brown’s wife discovered flirtatious text messages from the patient on her husband’s mobile phone.

The woman, referred to as Patient A, told Brown’s partners about the affair and they reported him to the General Medical Council (GMC).

Ms Natasha Tahta, for the GMC, said: ‘She felt, looking back, she had been manipulated by Dr Brown and decided to speak out because of the impact it had on her family and over concern it might happen to someone else in the future.’

Dr Brown admitted having an inappropriate sexual relationship at a fitness to practise hearing in Manchester.

If he is found guilty of misconduct over the affair, he could face being struck off the medical register.

The GMC allege the 
inappropriate relationship started in November 2010 and continued up 
until last July, but the doctor claims it only lasted between March and 
July 2012.

He says the relationship began to develop when Patient A was discharged from hospital at the end of February 2012 after an operation to amputate a toe.

The hearing was told that during one consultation Dr Brown hugged the patient and rubbed the small of her back to comfort her before giving her his email address.

Giving evidence from behind a screen, Patient A told the panel: ‘It was quite difficult to get around but said I would maybe find it easier to email my thoughts to him.

‘We were sat on the sofa together. He put his arms around me and rubbed the small of my back because I was upset,’ she added.

‘It was the depression and how vulnerable I was, but that is the way that he consoled me.’

The pair began to exchange friendly personal emails, swapping details and pictures of family members.

‘We had a lot in common. He sent me picture of himself and his daughters, family pictures, ordinary friends chat about things we found funny, both liked, etc,' patient A said.

Their conversations soon became more intimate as the couple began to send sexually explicit messages by text and on MSN instant messenger.

Their relationship became physical at the beginning of April 2012 and the couple met several times for sex, the hearing was told.

Fiona Neale, defending Dr Brown, suggested to the patient: ‘He knew he was doing something that was reckless and wrong, but did it anyway and he made it plain to you throughout that the responsibility for that was his and in no way were you to blame for that situation.’

Patient A first told Dr Brown’s colleagues at the surgery there had been no sexual relationship and they were just friends.

She even wrote a letter to the practice and encouraged her youngest daughter to do the same in an attempt to save Dr Brown’s career.

But when Dr Brown told her he had resigned from the practice and was leaving the area to ‘try to save his marriage’, Patient A told his partners about the affair.

She said: ‘Basically, my conscience was bothering me and I felt I had made a huge mistake in writing the letter to the surgery to say we had not had a relationship and felt that I should do the right thing.

‘He was not telling me not to do it, but he was telling me what the outcome would be if I did do it. He did tell me what he had said to the partners about the relationship previously.

‘I believe there were certain things in the letter [to the practice] that he had mentioned which I had not,’ said Patient A.

‘We both had three girls, we were both fans of Monty Python, basic things like that. Things he had told me.’

Dr Brown denies encouraging Patient A to include misleading information in a letter to Uplands and Mumbles Surgeries.

Dr Brown has also admitted behaving dishonestly by asking Patient A to delete all correspondence between them, including texting her to say: ‘Make sure you delete them all because it’s how we got into bother.’

Dr Brown is currently subject to conditional registration, which restricts him to working for Swansea Out of Hours Service or the Singleton Hospital, in Swansea.

He is not allowed to carry out face-to-face consultations with female patients unless there is a chaperone present.

The hearing continues.
