All Blacks veteran Keven Mealamu had a Brodie Retallick moment when quizzed on the injury crisis that has decimated England's pack ahead of Saturday's autumn international opener at Twickenham.

Mealamu's team-mate Retallick famously could not name a single England player when asked to during last summer's tour of New Zealand, and while Mealamu's faux pas was not quite of the same proportion, it may be perceived as another example of Kiwi indifference towards England.

Asked if the All Blacks would look to take advantage of England's problems up front, a puzzled Mealamu admitted: 'To be honest I'm not too sure on who's injured at the moment.'

When told England had seven regular forwards out - Alex Corbisiero, Tom Youngs, Dan Cole, Joe Launchbury, Geoff Parling, Tom Croft and Tom Johnson - the 121-cap hooker, 35, backtracked somewhat.

'They're pretty lucky up here,' added. 'They have always had a good forward pack up here, so we're expecting no matter who is on the field it is going to be an English calibre forward pack.'

Whether or not talismanic fly half Dan Carter starts on Saturday was the burning question for the assembled Kiwi press - who were also unaware of England's injury problems - on Monday.

Carter came off the bench to feature in Saturday's 12-try demolition of the United States in Chicago. It was his first appearance since injuring his leg in the Super Rugby final back in July.

Dan Carter's last game before the weekend was for the Canterbury Crusaders in July

Assistant coach Ian Foster said: 'Dan came through really well. He had a smile on his face afterwards and the signs are really, really positive.'

Asked if he and head coach Steve Hansen had seen enough to convince them Carter was ready to start ahead of Aaron Cruden, Foster added: ‘It was a good first step for him and we're delighted with that.

'I thought he looked half a yard off the pace early on but I think we started to see him get back in to the right sort of tempo as the game finished. We'll make an assessment when it's time this week.'
