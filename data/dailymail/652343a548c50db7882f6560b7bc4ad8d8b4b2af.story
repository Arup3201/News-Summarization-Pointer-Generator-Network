This pasta recipe is so simple that even a dog can crack it.

And in a new Youtube video, canine cook Chef Panda does just that, effortlessly preparing a delicious dish of spaghetti carbonara.

The Boston Terrier, who features in films produced by American cookery and food delivery website Blue Apron, guides viewers through the process in a number of easy steps.

Showing off his his enviable cooking skills, he chops, tosses and stirs with ease to make the decadent and creamy Italian dish.

Mmmm Bacon: Blue Apron's Boston Terrier Chef Panda licks his lips in anticipation of his Italian meal 

Before he starts, he first heads to the computer to make sure he has the right recipe for his Italian feast.

After choosing a soundtrack Chef Panda heads to the kitchen to start preparations.

First he thoroughly washes his paws under running water.Then he fills a pot with water before putting it on to boil.

Next it’s time to chop the bacon. Carefully lifting the waxed paper so his paws don’t touch the meat, the puppy chef cautiously slices bacon before placing it in a bowl.

He then pours some oil into a saucepan before sautéing the meat, carefully shaking the pan and stirring so all the bacon is browned.

First things first: The puppy chef boils spaghetti (left) before draining it in his red colander (right)

He takes the pan off the heat and tosses in bacon, egg and cheese mixture into the cooked spaghetti

While the bacon is cooking Chef Panda cracks an egg into a bowl and whips it gently with a fork. He follows this by grating some pecorino cheese into a saucepan.

As the water has now boiled, he throws some spaghetti into the pot. A few minutes later he lifts out a strand to test and nods in approval as it is perfectly al dente.

Draining the pasta, the clever pup saves some of the starchy cooking water before he transfers the hot noodles into the pan with the bacon.

With impeccable timing, he quickly combines the eggs, starchy cooking water, and cheese with the noodles.  

Time for dinner! The Boston Terrier can't wait to dig into his Italian feast, which is plated up in a blue bowl

Taking the pan off the heat, Panda thoroughly tosses the spaghetti so every strand is coated in the eggy-cheesy-bacony mixture.

Chef Panda then plates the spaghetti in a blue bowl, puts a gingham napkin around his neck and digs into his delicious meal, which is accompanied by a large glass of red wine.

The film, which was uploaded on YouTube by American cooking website Blue Apron was filmed by filmmakers Matthew Wadiak and Daniel Schloss.
