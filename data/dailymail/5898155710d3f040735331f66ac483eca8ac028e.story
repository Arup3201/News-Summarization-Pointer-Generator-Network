Health unions have threatened more walkouts through the winter if the Government refuses to back down in a row over pay.

Hundreds of thousands of nurses, midwives, healthcare assistants, ambulance drivers, hospital porters and cooks took part in a four-hour strike yesterday morning.

Scans and home visits for expectant mothers were delayed, while dozens of less-urgent 999 calls went unattended by paramedics.

Non-urgent caesarean sections and other elective operations were also cancelled, while Unison claimed many operating theatres sat empty.

Soldiers and police officers had to be called in to drive ambulances, coming to the aid of one woman in labour and an elderly woman with breathing difficulties.

At one point, paramedics had to be pulled off the picket lines to attend to a woman suffering a ‘diabetic fit’.

Unison also claimed two-thirds of outpatient clinics were either cancelled or limited to urgent cases.

The controversial industrial action was the first NHS workers’ strike over pay in 32 years and the first ever walkout for members of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM).

Former Tory health minister Edwina Currie told a £39,000-a-year midwife she should be ‘ashamed’ of herself for taking part in the strike yesterday.

Frances Walker, 50, told Radio 2 that under-pressure midwives were at the ‘end of their tether’.

But Miss Currie, who took part in the on-air debate on the Jeremy Vine show, made a scathing attack on the community midwife, who is also a steward for the Royal College of Midwives.

Miss Currie said the basic salary for a midwife who has worked for at least a year was £25,783, which she said was ‘about the national average’. She said: ‘You are going on strike at the expense of the people earning much less than you have.’

Prompted by Mr Vine, Mrs Walker admitted she earned £39,000. Miss Currie, 68, said: ‘There is absolutely no case for a £39,000-a-year member of staff in an important, valued and precious profession to…strike. You should be ashamed of yourself.’

Mrs Walker, who works for the Gloucestershire Hospitals trust, insisted: ‘We made sure we had cover completely for the delivery suite and the birth units and the maternity ward so no harm came to any mother or baby, thank you Edwina.’

Now, some of the seven unions involved have warned there could be more strikes within weeks if the Government does not meet their demand to honour a 1 per cent pay increase.

They are understood to be considering whether to stage further strikes together or choose different dates to cause maximum impact.

The nationwide walkout yesterday was staged despite fewer than half of those balloted across the health unions voting for action.

Unison, which is one of the biggest unions, persuaded just one in ten eligible members to vote in favour. It is not known exactly how many took part yesterday, but the GMB, Unite, Unison, UCATT, Managers in Partnership, the British Association of Occupational Therapists and the RCM have more than 400,000 members in the NHS in England, out of 1.3million staff.

The NHS Confederation, which represents trust bosses, cast doubt on the legitimacy of the strike, claiming only around 4 per cent of staff had voted to take part.

Yesterday, Rachael Maskell, head of health at the Unite union, said: ‘We are already planning, and will definitely be taking, further industrial action if the Government doesn’t put more money on the table and doesn’t talk to us.’

Jon Skewes of the RCM said: ‘The ballot enables us to carry on industrial action for as long as is necessary.’ But he said that while they will ‘consider mounting further action’, he hoped the Government would instead ‘return to the table’ to continue negotiations.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt yesterday warned that 14,000 nursing jobs would have to be axed over the next two years in order to pay the salary increase in full.

He said it would be wrong to cut jobs in order to hand a 1 per cent pay rise to tens of thousands of staff who are already receiving pay increments worth an average 3 per cent. Mr Hunt said almost 60 per cent of NHS staff qualify for an annual pay increment.

Seven unions taking part in the industrial action are calling for a one per cent pay rise for all NHS staff

‘Why is it that we are saying we can’t afford to give 1 per cent on top of the 3 per cent rises that around 55 per cent of NHS staff are getting?’ he said. ‘The answer is that we have had very clear analysis that if we did that hospital chief executives would lay off around 4,000 nurses this year and around 10,000 nurses next year.

‘Now, the NHS has just come through a terrible tragedy with Mid Staffs – we discovered the most appalling care happening there and indeed at some other hospitals.

‘We have turned a corner on that by recruiting in our hospitals around 5,000 extra nurses ... we don’t want to turn the clock back.’

Sources said funding a 1 per cent pay increase for NHS staff would cost £450million over two years.

Yesterday, up to 130 military drivers helped ambulance staff in London and the North West, the Ministry of Defence said. West Midlands Ambulance Service said it had been forced to pull crew off the picket line in Dudley to help a woman suffering ‘a diabetic fit’.

The Society of Radiographers, which did not strike yesterday, is planning a walkout next Monday.
