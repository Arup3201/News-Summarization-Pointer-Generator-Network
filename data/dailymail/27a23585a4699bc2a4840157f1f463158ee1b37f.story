Neil Warnock has lifted the lid on his exit from Crystal Palace, revealing that he spoke to Alan Pardew in the summer and told him to move to Selhurst Park.

Speaking to Danny Kelly on talkSPORT's Sports Breakfast, Warnock told of Palace's trip to St James' Park in his first game as Eagles manager.

'You'll laugh at this but when we were at Newcastle, Alan was getting so much stick there,' Warnock said. 'I remember pulling him after the game and said, "This is the club for you, your next club."

Warnock says that he spoke to Alan Pardew in August to recommend he took the manager's job at Palace

'Alan will know all the bits and bobs. He's a good manager and it's beneficial for everyone - Newcastle as well. It's great for him to go to London; I would have liked the chairman to tell me they had a chance of getting Alan Pardew and (ask) would I mind stepping down.'

Warnock appeared happy at his current situation, admitting that he knew his tenancy at Crystal Palace was only temporary. His sacking, though, did come as a shock.

'It was really sudden, a phone call late on before I was leaving to go to QPR. The chairman just said it and it came as a shock. As things have panned out [with Pardew], it's not as much of a shock now.

'Ronnie Jepson, when I was clearing my desk, he said, "Gaffer, they've got someone else."

'I only wanted this season to help them stabilise when Tony [Pulis] left. There were no standout candidates. I said to the chairman then, "You may as well put me in charge and then wait for a good candidate to come along".'

Pardew has been widely criticised by the Newcastle supporters, but will now join a club where he is loved

A reason for Pulis' sudden departure, just two days before the start of the Premier League season, was transfer dealings - something which Pardew will now be tasked with in the January window.

'I think [Steve Parish] will [spend] with Alan, now. It's difficult to get your transfer targets. The problem is the chairman is trying to do everything. He's not got round to replacing Iain Moody so he's got a lot on his plate. Alan is a good manager who will take a lot off him.

'The fans are unbelievable, so in the fight for survival I think we'll have miles more than anyone else. I can even see them going as high as 11th or 12th... Palace are the best team in that bottom eight.'

Warnock's sacking proved to be a decisive factor in kick-starting the managerial merry go-round this season. Alan Irvine has gone from West Brom, while Newcastle will also be searching for a new manager with Pardew heading south.

The former Eagles man believes that Steve Bruce should take the job at St James' Park, while former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood is a perfect fit for West Brom.

'You've got to be in front as a manager, when's the right time? I looked at [Steve Bruce] last season and I thought, "it can't happen again." If he gets offered the chance at Newcastle, he'll have to take it. There's a time to move, and in Alan's case - and Steve's - the time is now.

'Sherwood fits the bill at West Brom too.' 

But what next for Warnock? He remains happy with the four-month job he did at Selhurst Park, but will there be another quick appointment for him? He is, in fact, second favourite with some bookmakers to take the vacant manager's job at Rangers.

'Oh, my goodness... that is great. I've watched seven episodes of Downton Abbey in the last few days - you miss out on things like that... things are not all doom and gloom.

'It was great to go back to Palace and I feel we can hold our heads up. We've given them a fighting chance, they've got a hell of a chance. 

'I miss this [punditry], I had great time with you guys [talkSPORT] and BT Sport was great. I appreciated the opportunity to steady the ship [at Palace]. The club can move forward in every situation now.'
