It was always going to take something out of the ordinary to beat Hugo Lloris in this kind of mood and it did — an extraordinary piece of slapstick defending from Vlad Chiriches to concede a late penalty.

Like an accident trying to happen or a centre half with his shoelaces tied together, Chiriches misjudged a long punt out of the sky and then turned and handled the ball inside the penalty area as he tried to recover from his initial slip.

Demba Ba stepped up to convert from the spot and Tottenham had to settle for a point. ‘I don’t talk about Vlad’s actions,’ said manager Mauricio Pochettino. ‘It was unfortunate. In football you can always make a mistake. We need to accept that. But it was disappointing to concede the goal in the last minute. I am very disappointed, angry and frustrated.’

Ratings by Jack Gaughan at White Hart Lane

Spurs have won only one of their last seven and although the draw was a fair result they seemed set to defy the negative spiral when Harry Kane fired them ahead and Lloris set about protecting the lead with a series of stunning saves.

‘He’s one of the best, he is complete, he’s brilliant,’ said Besiktas boss Slaven Bilic about Lloris, although the goalkeeper really ought to have been retrieving the ball from his net in the opening seconds after the first mistake of the night by Chiriches, who gave the ball to Jose Sosa, who touched it to Olcay Sahan, darting in from the left.

Sahan nudged a pass towards Ba but both he and Federico Fazio missed it as they wrestled each other to the ground and Sahan picked it up on the other side but, with only Lloris to beat, slid his effort wide.

It was an incredible chance, the first of three for the winger, who gave Eric Dier all sorts of problems but could not conjure a finish. Sahan was denied by Lloris, just before half-time and went close with an acrobatic volley after the interval.

More opportunities were never far away with Chiriches and Fazio at the back. Chiriches is quick across the turf and Fazio strong in the air, but they offer so much hope to strikers with their loose marking and casual distribution.

Ba crashed an effort into the woodwork in the first half after Fazio failed to cut out a cross from the left. He required two attempts to get it under control before thumping a right-footer against the frame of the goal, where the post meets the bar.

The former West Ham, Newcastle and Chelsea striker left his mark on Chiriches physically as well as psychologically with a stray arm across the face, forcing the Spurs defender to spend most of the game with cotton-wool plugs in his nostrils. Ba was booked for the foul.

Having started with such intent, Besiktas were rocked by Kane’s strike midway through the half. There was little sign of danger when Nabil Bentaleb rolled a short pass forward but the visitors switched off.

Kane took a couple of touches, moving right to left across the field, worked the ball on to his left foot and drove a low shot back across goalkeeper Tolga Zengin. What it lacked in ferocity it made up for with accuracy and crept inside the post.

There may come a point soon when Pochettino has to promote him to the first team — the team he plays in the Barclays Premier League.

Kane has four goals despite having started only four games this season, all in Europe. He has only appeared for 39 minutes in the league, where Spurs have failed to win in their last four and face Pochettino’s former club Southampton on Sunday.

Kane may not have the finesse and sophistication of other individuals around him in the Tottenham squad but his work-rate is exceptional and he has a goal knack.

The goal knocked the Turks out of their rhythm. The tempo dropped and Spurs enjoyed more possession with Kane looking for a second. Zengin made a good block from a fierce strike on the angle and he was denied again by a fabulous save from the keeper, 20 minutes from time.

The pick of Lloris’s saves was one from close range to tip over from Ba after a long pass from Oguzhan Ozyakup, but he was given no chance with the penalty. Ba slid it into the corner after a stuttering run-up.

Group C is tight, with Asteras Tripolis of Greece top after beating Partizan Belgrade, who are bottom, last night, with Spurs and Besiktas in between on two points.

‘To concede that late is very disappointing,’ said Kane. ‘We wanted to win to take forward the momentum. We’ve got to move on. We’ve got another big game on Sunday.’
