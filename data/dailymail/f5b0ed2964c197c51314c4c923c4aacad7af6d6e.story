'Toothless legislation': TSA officials will be able to touch passengers' intimate areas if they can show grounds for suspicion

Texas has backed watered-down laws to stop TSA officials touching passengers inappropriately during airport searches.

But critics have accused lawmakers of passing 'toothless' legislation after it was severley altered to allow security officials to touch sexual organs if they have a 'reasonable suspicion'.

The move is likely to increase anger towards intrusive searches after it emerged that 95-year-old leukemia sufferer Lena Repert was asked to remove her diaper by officials.

The Texas legislation aims to criminalize intentional, inappropriate touching during airport security pat-downs.

It would still be a misdemeanor punishable with up to a year in jail to touch a person's sexual organs and other sensitive areas.

But security officials will have a defence against prosecution if they act with 'reasonable suspicion' that the search is necessary.

That change prompted chants of 'Traitor!' by a small group of protesters at the Texas Senate today shortly after the House cast a preliminary vote in favor of the bill.

The protesters then gathered in the Senate gallery and several called out 'Treason!' to senators below. The Senate passed its version several hours after the protesters left.

The Republican-controlled chambers have until Wednesday to resolve several differences between their bills before sending one to Governor Rick Perry to consider signing it into law.

Supporters of the bill complained the changes make the penalties unenforceable.

Texas law already bans public servants from subjecting someone to a search he or she 'knows is unlawful'.

About two dozen people showed up to testify in support of the bill in the Senate Committee on Transportation and Homeland Security, then opposed it when they learned the bill was going to be changed on the recommendation of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a Republican.

'The simple act of opting out of the body scanners is going to be reasonable suspicion,' said Heather Fazio of Austin. 'That is unacceptable.'

Senator Dan Patrick, R-Houston, defended the change, saying the bill still sends a strong message to Transportation Security Administration security screeners to keep their wandering hands off Texans.

Patrick noted that the TSA announced last week that it would try to reduce the number of pat-downs performed on children.

'The goal is to get the TSA to change their policy,' Patrick said. "'SA is going change their policy because Texas is taking the lead."

TSA spokesman Greg Soule said Americans expect authorities to use 'effective methods to keep the traveling public safe' and that the agency will review the bill if passed into law.

All of the testimony for the bill has concentrated on stories of people being searched and included no actual examples of TSA officers being reprimanded or disciplined for improper touching.

Although dismissed last week as a 'publicity stunt' by Republican House Speaker Joe Straus, the issue has become a top priority for the libertarian wing of the Texas GOP.

Few Texas airports are equipped with full-body scanners, meaning there often is no other screening option for travelers picked out for what TSA calls an enhanced pat down.

Opponents have simmered over procedures they consider a violation of their Constitutional right against unwarranted search and seizure.

Texas made it a full-blown fight with the TSA last month when the Texas House voted to criminalize intrusive pat-downs.

That
version appeared ready to pass the Senate until John E. Murphy, the 
U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas, warned lawmakers that 
it would interfere with the TSA's ability to ensure travelers' safety.

Murphy's
letter to legislators said if the original bill passed, the federal 
government would probably go to court to block it and the TSA would 
likely be required to cancel flights if it cannot ensure passenger 
safety.

TSA officials 
say advance imaging technology and pat downs are the most effective way 
to detect threats such as explosives made of plastics, liquids or gels 
designed to not be detected by traditional metal detectors.

The
issue prompted some small but loud demonstrations outside the House and
Senate chambers last month and many of them showed up again for 
Monday's vote. Texas Gov.

Rick
Perry, a Republican considering a run for president, added the pat-down
bill to the agenda of the 30-day special session he called on May 31.

But the bill has lost significant momentum over the last week.

Straus
appeared to strike a major blow against the original version of the 
bill when he warned it would hurt commercial aviation in Texas and would
make the state a 'laughingstock'.

Monday's changes further eroded support.

'TSA
is abusing people,' said Don Hart of Austin, who opposed the new 
version approved Monday. 'TSA will be empowered to keep doing what they 
are doing.'
