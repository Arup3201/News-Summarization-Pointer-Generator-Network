Ed Miliband has revealed that he does not follow 'British news' - and instead prefers American political bogs and French economic theory.

The Labour leader said he does not read newspapers or watch the news - and relies on his aides to tell him what's going on in the country.

The revelation will add the concern among Labour MPs that Mr Miliband is out of touch with ordinary Brits.

Ed Miliband was mocked after a number of awkward images appeared of him eating a bacon sandwich

He has faced criticism from leading members of his shadow cabinet that he is 'weird' and was accused of being 'out of touch with reality' for not knowing the price of an ordinary weekly shop.

Mr Miliband was also the butt of internet mockery after unflattering images of him struggling to eat a bacon sandwich were published last week.

But the Labour leader dismissed the criticism - and insisted that his 'cost of living crisis' theme had hit a chord with the public.

Speaking to the website Buzzfeed, he said he was in Nottingham last Tuesday when a man approached him to say that his part-time job at a petrol station wasn’t paying enough to take care of two children.

The Labour leader 'looks weird, sounds weird, is weird', one shadow cabinet colleague said. But Mr Miliband insists the public will focus on the issues when it comes to next year's election

Mr Miliband says he prefers US political websites to 'British news' and relies on his aides to tell him what is happening in the UK

Mr Miliband said: 'He was really, really desperate because he felt couldn’t properly provide for his family. He was thinking of ending it all because he just couldn’t make ends meet.'

'Suddenly bacon sandwiches look slightly beside the point,' he added.

Mr Miliband said he just ignored the personal criticism about his image and got on with his job.

According to the Buzzfeed interview Mr Miliband does not have any TV screens showing rolling news channels in his office. He also refuses to have newspapers delivered to his home. Instead he relies on aides to tell him what is going on.

Mr Miliband said his favourite news website is RealClearPolitics - an American political site popular in Washington. He also revealed that he tries to avoid Twitter, which his admits having a 'decidedly mixed record' with.

The Labour leader once accidentally paid tribute to the late Bob Holness as the host of ‘Blackbusters’.

He said: 'It’s always a good idea not to read the newspapers. I don’t read much British news.

Ed Miliband said the personal attacks did not bother him - and showed the Tories were struggling to find a way to beat Labour

'You get a lot of advice in the newspapers about what you should do. It’s much more important to follow your own path and stick to your own path. I’ve made that a rule in the last three and a half years.'

Mr Miliband said the attacks on him showed the Tories were struggling to find a way to beat him.

He said: 'Think about the attacks my opponents have been making on me, there’s a certain incoherence about their attacks.

'First of all they said I was "Red Ed", then they said I was weak, then they said it was back to the 1970s, and now it’s something else.'

Mr Miliband was asked if it was a problem that the public thought he was a bit weird?

He said: 'Frankly they were saying that… the press people who don’t like us have been saying that for some time. It comes with the territory.

'I think the heart of this is people think we are in a position to win the election and there are some people who don’t want us to win this election.'

Mr Miliband also reveals that he does not think he will be able to take a holiday between now and the general election next May.

He takes a break from politics by watching American baseball - and his team, the Boston Red Sox - on his iPad. He is also currently reading the left wing French economist Thomas Piketty.

His two boys, aged three and four, prefer football - and rooted for Arsenal in the club’s FA Cup final victory over Hull.

Mr Miliband added: 'I want them to make their own decisions about who they support.'
