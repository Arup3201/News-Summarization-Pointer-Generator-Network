A good Samaritan has smashed a stranger's windshield to pull a baby boy from a sweltering hot car while his father shopped in a nearby supermarket.

Angela Radtke, from San Antonio, Texas, saw the one-year-old child locked in a car in the parking lot of an H-E-B supermarket just off Interstate 10 on Saturday afternoon and raised the alarm.

Despite being warned by passersby and security guards that she could be arrested for damaging the car, she smashed through the windshield with a tire iron, KENS5 reported.

She then climbed inside the car to pull out the tot - slicing her arms, legs and back on broken glass in the process.

Quick-thinking: Angela Radtke demonstrates how she smashed a car's windshield after seeing a one-year-old boy overheating inside. She said she broke the window even though she was told she might be arrested

'I don't care if I get arrested, I'm going to save this baby,' Radtke told witnesses.

When she pulled him out, she said the baby was running a temperature and looked red. 

Radtke, who was not charged because of Texas' 'good Samaritan' act, said she did not hesitate to help the young child.  

'I felt like some people were kind of scared,' she told KENS5. 'They didn't want to be liable because the security guard was yelling that I could possibly be arrested for breaking the window.' 

Damage: An image shows the smashed window, which Radtke then climbed through to retrieve the boy. His father had been inside the supermarket for 40 minutes and told cops he had forgotten about his son

Charged: Richard Elliott, 36, allegedly left his young son inside his locked car while at the supermarket with one of his older daughters. His wife, pictured with him right, was at home at the time

Surveillance cameras outside the store revealed that the child's father, 36-year-old Richard Elliott, allegedly went inside for nearly 40 minutes with his 12-year-old daughter, leaving the baby alone.

The San Antonio Police Department noted that the car's windows were rolled up.   

Staff attempted to reach Elliott using loudspeakers in the store, but he did not come outside until some time after. 

When he finally emerged to find the commotion surrounding his car, he told authorities he had forgotten about the baby in the back seat, KENS5 reported.

Left behind: The little boy, pictured left and right with his mother, was dehydrated when he was pulled out

The little boy was taken by EMS to Methodist Children Hospital and treated for dehydration before being placed in custody of Child Protective Services.

'The child appeared to be suffering from heat exposure and dehydration, but was not critically injured,' according to the preliminary information report from the San Antonio Police Department.

Elliott has now been charged with child endangerment, a third-degree felony, and bond was set at $4,000. The child's mother was at home at the time of the incident.
