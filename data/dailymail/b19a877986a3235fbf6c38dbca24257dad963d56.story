Brighton’s Amex Stadium could host its first major rugby match ahead of the World Cup if Wasps qualify for the semi-final of the European Champions Cup.

Should Dai Young’s side dethrone Toulon at the Stade Felix Mayol on Sunday, they will take on either Leinster or Bath in a final-four knockout match at the Championship football ground.

The 30,750 capacity arena, which opened in 2011, hosted and Under 20 Six Nations fixture between England and France earlier this month, gearing up to stage South Africa vs Japan and Samoa vs United States in Pool B of the World Cup.

Should Wasps fail to progress, then Toulon will face Leinster or Bath at the Stade Velodrome in Marseille.

The second semi-final will be played at the Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in Saint-Etienne or the Ricoh Arena in Coventry, depending on the respective winner of Clermont Auvernge vs Northampton. They will take on the winner of Racing Metro vs Saracens.
