A 25-year-old woman is trapped in the body of a 12-year-old and is appealing to medics to help cure her rare condition.

Kate Quinn is believed to be the only woman in Ireland to have Caudal Regression Syndrome (CRS).

The rare disorder, which she discovered she had two years ago, means she has never been through puberty, had regular periods or had to buy a bra.

It also means her lower spine has not developed properly so she stands at just 4ft 9ins tall.Â 

Now Miss Quinn, who says she has spent her early 20s 'hiding away' and living her life in 'limbo', has appealed to experts to come up with a cure.

She believes she will not be able to find love unless she becomes a 'real' woman, she told Irish Independent.

The condition is thought to affect just one in 25,000 people across the world.

Doctors say the fact she hasn't gone through puberty is a side-effect of her condition but they cannot explain why.

Caudal regression syndrome is a rare disorder where the lower spine does not develop properly.

It occurs in every on in 25,000 births.

The condition can lead to medical problems including partial absence of the tail bone regions to major malformation of the pelvis and spine.

Severe cases mean some people are paralysed and can suffer from incontinence.

Before more comprehensive medical treatment was available full amputation of the legs at the hip was performed in severe cases.

It has been speculated the condition might be associated with dietary deficiencies, including a lack of folic acid.

They said the fact her hormones are not working properly is not normally associated with CRS.

She has been injected
with hormones for seven years in a bid to encourage her body to go into
puberty - but to no avail.

Trips to the surgery every day have prevented her from being able to enroll on college courses or get a job.

She told the newspaper: 'The longer it goes on, the worse you feel because at 12 or 14 you feel you might develop, but now at 25 you start wondering if it's too late and ask yourself if you'll ever develop.'

Miss Quinn, from Mooncoin, Co Kilkenny, said because her body hasn't developed to the age it should be she 'kind of hides away'.

She said she has been in 'limbo' since the problem began at 14.

Miss Quinn hopes a doctor may come forward with a solution following the publicity.
