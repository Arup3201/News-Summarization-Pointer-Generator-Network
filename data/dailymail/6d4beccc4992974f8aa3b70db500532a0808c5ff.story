Mesut Ozil celebrated Arsenal's win over Aston Villa with a trip to see George Groves win the European super middleweight title alongside team-mate Lukas Podolski and golfer Rory McIlroy.

And, after the bout, the Gunners stars were pictured celebrating in the ring with Groves - who is a massive Chelsea fan!

The German attacking midfielder put in a superb display on Saturday afternoon, scoring one and assisting one, as Arsenal ran out 3-0 winners at Villa Park.

His display would have come as a huge relief after a string of underwhelming performances this season.

McIlroy was enjoying himself at the bout as he prepares to take his place in Europe's Ryder Cup team at Gleneagles next weekend.

The fight, taking place at Wembley arena, was won by Groves in his first return to the ring since being knocked out by Carl Froch at Wembley in May.

The London-born fighter beat Frenchman Christopher Rebrasse in a unanimous verdict to secure the European super middleweight title.
