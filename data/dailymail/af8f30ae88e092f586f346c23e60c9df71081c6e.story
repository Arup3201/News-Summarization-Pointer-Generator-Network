A disturbing video of a man being dragged through a David Jones store in Sydney begging for someone to 'help' him has shocked and disgusted a top lawyer who witnessed the incident.

Chris Murphy told Daily Mail Australia the 'excessive and frightening force used on a fragile person and skinny looking guy' being man-handled by two security guards gave him visions of a 'concentration camp'.

Mr Murphy filmed the worrying shoplifting incident at the David Jones store in Bondi Junction, in Sydney's east, on Saturday at around 2pm.

'It was screamingly sad  - and I do this for a living,' he said.

Shocked: Chris Murphy spotted the man cornered by David Jones staff and began filming

'He's a vulnerable and powerless person under the brute force of corporate Australia. Those heavy grasps at the wrists - it was like a violent bully dragging him,' he added.

Mr Murphy posted the footage of a distressed man being pulled by his arms and wrists through the store on YouTube and Twitter and comments from concerned members of the public soon poured in. 

In the 3.28 minute long clip, a man in skinny jeans, thongs, a t-shirt, long hair and a cap is seen cornered by a plain clothed security officer in a grey hoody and another David Jones staff member in a black suit.

'Tell him to let go of me. You're hurting me mate, let go of me,' the man who was suspected of shoplifting said.

The man in the grey hoody replied: 'I'm not putting any pressure on you.'

'I didn’t take anything,' the victim said and the security officer replied 'you've stolen, did you not?' as he moved close.

This causes the shopper to shout 'don’t touch me'. The two David Jones staff members try to speak quietly to the man but he continues to shout loudly, perhaps so the camera being held by Mr Murphy can hear him.

'Don’t touch me, he is gripping my wrists, you are gripping my wrists mate, you are gripping my wrists,' he yelled.

The two men then begin to drag the man through the store past the cosmetic counters. They both have a grip on his arms and he tries to sit down by the entrance to stop them pulling him along.

They then slide him along the floor as he shouts: 'Let go of me you're hurting me.'

The man in grey hoody says 'you can walk with me or I’ll drag you along', to which the man being dragged shouts 'f**k off'.

Next they pick him up from under his arms and he turns to desperately look at the camera. 'Somebody help me this guy is hurting me,' he pleads.

The struggle continues past shocked shoppers as he says 'my bag is back there'. 'Get off me,' he cries as his hat falls off and the pair take him onto the escalator downstairs.

'Leave me alone, somebody help me, mate my bags are back there,' he says.

The man in a grey hoody says: 'Yeah we got it don’t worry. Well talk to you then let you go'.

The man's arm is seen twisted behind his back as he yells 'where are you taking me' and 'you're hurting my wrists'.

The security guards explains 'you are not co-operating with me are you not?… you stole you come with me and that's it.'

As they get downstairs and walk through a café the man shouts 'where's my mum? You're hurting me.'

A security man then comes along and warns Mr Murphy that he is not allowed to film in the store. To which Mr Murphy replies: 'Watch it on YouTube later.'

'Don't touch me': The man yelled 'he is gripping my wrists, you are gripping my wrists mate'

'Get off me': He cries out as his hat falls off and the pair take him onto the escalator downstairs

The man is taken into a 'staff only' area and three more dark suited security guards follow him in as the doors swing close, one is carrying the man's two shopping bags from Woolworths. 

The man is last heard shouting 'get away from me' as he is taken out of shot. Another woman comes and warns Mr Murphy he's not allowed to film in the store.

A NSW police spokesperson said police attended an incident at the store at 2.30pm involving a 39-year-old male.

The Bondi local was ‘banned from entering all David Jones stores for 12 months,’ a NSW police spokesperson said.

'He was issued a criminal infringement notice for shoplifting,' they added.

'Consistent with company policy the gentleman in question was identified as a shop lifter and apprehended while police were called,' a David Jones spokeswoman said.

'Police attended the store following which the gentleman was given a Criminal Infringement Notice and fined for shoplifting.'

Talking to MailOnline on Sunday, Mr Murphy said he noticed the incident while shopping for a suit.

'As I was walking out of the store at 2pm I saw this emaciated man totally confused. They were dragging him into the store,' he said.

'He called out for his mum, he’s obviously stressed, he’s emaciated, he’s almost in tears and they were man-handling and dragging him inside.'

Mr Murphy said he has been a lawyer for 42 years and whatever the man may or may not have done would he would not have been 'going to jail for it'.

No questions: The security guard explains 'you are not co-operating with me are you not?… you stole you come with me and that’s it' as he is pulled past shoppers in the store

'I just had a vision of a concentration camp, this skinny guy being pulled and dragged around. He only had two plastic bags with drinks in them from Woolies,' he explained.

The lawyer has offered to represent the man pro-bono after he was so horrified by what he saw. 'We have a lot of fragile and borderline people who shouldn't be mistreated. This was a full abuse of power,' he said. 

The 'squad of nine people' who eventually ended up on the scene with the man downstairs in David Jones was 'force beyond any concept of what was appropriate' he said.

'It is the middle of winter, it is bloody cold and he’s this guy in a pair of thongs and a narrow shirt,' he said.

'This excessive violence and form of violence would never be inflicted by a court,' he added.

Mr Murphy expressed how he has no agenda and doesn’t need work. 'I refuse work,' he said.

'This was a pathetic incident I was ensnared in,' he added.

A David Jones spokesperson said: 'Consistent with company policy the gentleman in question was identified as a shop lifter and apprehended while police were called. Police attended the store following which the gentleman was given a Criminal Infringement Notice and fined for shoplifting.'

All States have a legal basis to make a citizen's arrest. In NSW it's under Section 100 of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002. It reads:A person (other than a police officer) may, without a warrant, arrest a person if:

A person who arrests another person under this section must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, take the person, and any property found on the person, before an authorised officer to be dealt with according to law.

You can use only 'reasonable force' to detain them – force that is 'reasonable' to the situation.

And you can't detain someone too violently as you have a 'duty of care' to the person you detain.
