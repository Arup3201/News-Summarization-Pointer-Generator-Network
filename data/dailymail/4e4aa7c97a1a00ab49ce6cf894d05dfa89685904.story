When Ed Sheeran lets his hair down after a hard day conquering the pop world, he likes to have a few beers with old mates at his newly restored Suffolk farmhouse.

But woe betide any friend who places his bottle down on a table, for the 23-year-old singer-songwriter will be sure to place a coaster quickly underneath to prevent it marking the surface.

‘I love cleaning, that’s my thing. I really like making the house perfect,’ says Sheeran, who claims he’s so house-proud that he frets if more than five people visit at once.

Unreal scenes: Ed Sheeran with Taylor Swift and Victoria's Secret models on stage at the underwear brand's annual Fashion Show in London last month

It’s fair to say that models lounging in baths full of champagne are probably out of the question. Rock ’n’ roll? More like Shake ’n’ Vac.

The spotlight swung once more on to the refreshingly unstarry but acutely business-savvy Sheeran this week as it emerged that he was 2014’s biggest-selling pop artist with his second album, X (pronounced Multiply). 

In Britain alone, it sold 1.7 million copies and, around the world, it has been played 430 million times on the online music provider Spotify.

He has been hailed as Britain’s biggest cultural export since ITV’s Downton Abbey and in some ways he is just as reassuringly cosy as the costume drama.

Here is a regular nice guy whose scruffy image, understated manner and proud housekeeping skills couldn’t be further from the showbusiness cliches. His songs are simple, almost uniquely combining folk and rap. He fills stadiums and yet performs unaccompanied with his acoustic guitar.

Thatcherite background? Ed Sheeran grew up in a middle-class family in Suffolk

We don’t yet know his political views — he’s far too self-effacing to foist those on us. But at the risk of ruining his credibility, it has to be said that, in many ways, Sheeran is the perfect Thatcherite pop star.

The product of a supportive, middle-class English family, he has pulled himself up through talent and sheer bloody-minded hard work.

You could hardly accuse Sheeran of riding the usual image-obsessed route to pop stardom. He’s sweet-looking rather than handsome — he boasts an unruly mop of ginger hair, an unconvincing beard and a student wardrobe. On stage without his guitar, he looks like a fan who’s just jumped up there.

But this ordinariness, say music industry insiders, is the secret to his success. Young fans can relate to Sheeran in a way they cannot to other, far more glamorous, stars.

Similarly, his songs touch on everyday themes such as the torment of young lovers who must part when they go to different universities. It’s not surprising he writes about ordinary, middle-class life, as that is exactly where Sheeran comes from.

He grew up in the Suffolk market town of Framlingham. His father is an art historian and his mother a jewellery maker. Both ardent music lovers, they introduced him to classic Sixties and Seventies artists. The young Sheeran says he was inspired to take up the guitar after seeing Eric Clapton in concert.

Unfocused at school, he was 14 when he released his first recording. At 17, he persuaded his parents to let him leave school and move to London to follow his passion.

His father, John, supportively cut out newspaper interviews with singer-songwriters, highlighting quotes he thought would help his son fulfil his dream. ‘I didn’t have a Plan B. This was it,’ Sheeran said in an interview just before Christmas. ‘My dad said: “If you really want to do it, don’t have a fall-back plan. Because you eventually will do it if there’s no other option.” ’

Sound advice, but life certainly wasn’t easy in those early years.

In his first year in London in 2008, his rent was covered by a £400-a-month grant while he took a music course. When the money ran out, he would doss down on sofas and even spent a couple of nights under an arch outside Buckingham Palace.

He would play wherever and whenever he could, busking around the London Underground and accepting payment for gigs in pubs in the form of food and beer. The following year, 2009, he played an astonishing 312 gigs. Why?

Because he discovered that James Morrison, a similar British song-writer who suddenly shot to fame a few years ago, succeeded after performing 200 concerts a year — and he wanted to do half as many again.

But by 2010, he had got into a rut. He decided to fly to Los Angeles, even though he had just one contact — the organiser of a poetry-reading night — in the city.

An early performance was seen by the actor and musician Jamie Foxx who won an Oscar for his role as singer Ray Charles in the film Ray.

The pair struck up an unlikely friendship and the actor let the Suffolk lad record in his studio and stay in his Hollywood home. Even better, Foxx featured Sheeran’s songs on his satellite radio music show, The Foxxhole.

Pride of Britain: Ed Sheeran, seen performing on the 2014 New Year's Eve Top of the Pops Special, has been hailed as Britain’s biggest cultural export since ITV’s Downton Abbey

This was noticed by an internet entrepreneur who plugged Sheeran on an online music channel that was popular with fans of the hip hop variant known as ‘grime’.

Suddenly, Sheeran was not only attracting fans on both sides of the Atlantic, but he was also managing to become popular with both white and black audiences.

He still didn’t have a record deal, however, and was putting out new recordings at his own expense.

By the time, in 2011, he released No 5 Collaborations Project, a set of songs recorded with various ‘grime’ stars, the internet buzz about Sheeran was so great that it went to No. 2 in the iTunes chart, selling 7,000 copies in the first week.

Sheeran explained in the Financial Times — a newspaper whose business focus seems to be right up his street — that he had refused to sign to a label in the early years, willing to gamble he could make it initially on his own and so, by waiting, demand megabucks.

His patience worked handsomely as he managed to hold out until the lead single from his debut album, a deceptively upbeat ballad called The A Team about a crack-addicted prostitute, had become a huge chart hit in 2011. In the meantime he moved back to London, and when more than 1,000 fans went to see a free gig in Camden, Sheeran performed four shows to make sure everyone who wanted to could see him.

After he eventually signed to the music giant Atlantic Records, Sheeran’s will to win only redoubled. The buzz at Atlantic was about how former Life Guards officer James Blunt was the hardest-working performer in the industry. Sheeran got hold of Blunt’s schedule and told his team that they would do double what Blunt did.

‘And that’s exactly what I did,’ he told the FT. ‘Because he was the hardest-working guy, I wanted to work as hard as him.’ Twice as hard in fact.

As the sales and awards piled up, he toured North America in 2013 with U.S. pop idol Taylor Swift who is now a close friend, as is ex-Friends star Courteney Cox in whose Malibu home Sheeran stayed last year writing music.

The career-obsessed Sheeran makes no bones about wanting to do more than just put out songs. ‘I put all my time and effort into making my music successful,’ he says.

He was so determined to have the Christmas No. 1 album that he went into the offices of music chain HMV and played for company bosses so they would give his CDs a better position in their stores.

It’s impressive that he has any time for romance. Although he been with girlfriend Athina Andrelos for about a year, his romantic life used to be somewhat more colourful.

He famously wrote a song about a woman who cheated on him. The ex in question is believed to have been singer Ellie Goulding and the man she left him for to have been One Direction star Niall Horan. 

He met Athina when she was the tour manager of a band who provided his support act. She now works for Jamie Oliver but has also, Sheeran admits, put in some valuable work smartening up her boyfriend’s on-stage appearance.

Still, why is he so gobsmackingly popular? Critics have always been lukewarm about him, citing bland tunes and cliched lyrics. But what do they matter when teenagers the world over regard Sheeran as ‘one of them’? And middle-aged mums and dads are also fans.

What’s more, they are impressed by his relentless drive — and his apparently natural image combining the sweetly shambolic ‘boy next door’ and the hard-nosed entrepreneur who pulled himself up by his bootstraps.
