WNBA star Brittney Griner has opened up more than ever about the intense bullying she suffered at school, revealing it was so bad at times she thought 'I don't even want to be alive.'

Griner, who on Wednesday night was named 'Best Female College Athlete' for her 2012-13 season at Baylor at the ESPY Awards ceremony in Los Angeles, said she was still haunted by the memories of her peers refusing to believe she was a girl, questioning her sexual orientation and even groping her physically.

'I was always taller, my feet were always bigger and my voice was deeper,' said Griner, who is 6 feet 8 with a wingspan of 88 inches. She publicly came out as a lesbian in April, ahead of the WNBA draft.

In an honest interview with the Los Angeles Times, the Phoenix Mercury powerhouse described one day in seventh grade when class had just let out and the hallway was flooded with students.

As Griner made her way through the crowd, a male student stopped her. 'You're a dude,' he said.

'I just stood there and took it. I was humiliated. The whole school was laughing at me,' Griner recalled to The Times.

'When I was younger, it really bothered 
me to the point where I was like "I don't even want to be alive; why am I
getting treated like that?"' Griner said. 'But as I got older, I 
started caring less.'

She said she told her mother she liked girls after her first day of high school.

'I felt a release, I felt better,' Griner said. 'She was so cool about it. She was like "I kinda already know, and I love you."'

Her father, a former Marine, didn't take it so well and tension between the two saw Griner move out in her senior year.

Despite her tumultuous home life, on court she shone, leading her team from Houston's Nimitz High to the Texas Division 5A girls' basketball state championship game and becoming America's most sought after recruit.

Tall: 'I was always taller, my feet were always bigger and my voice was deeper,' said Griner, who is 6 feet 8 and has a wingspan of 88 inches

But she was still subject to nasty taunts from opposing sides, which left her regularly crying alone in her room after games, she told The Times.

She went off to college at Baylor with a resolution to block out the negativity and not let bullying affect her. And by the end of sophomore year she succeeded.

But she said she chose to publicly come out in April, regardless of the fallout, to give young girls experiencing the same nightmare someone to look up to.

'I didn't have a real role model that I could look up to that was out openly,' she told The Times. 'I knew there were a lot of younger girls that needed someone.'

In May, Griner revealed how her former coach at Baylor told players to keep details of their sexuality under wraps for fear of damaging recruitment possibilities.

The top pick of the WNBA draft recalled being told by Kim Mulkey that talking openly about her homosexuality could damage the reputation of the basketball program.

Though Griner said she never hid the fact that she was gay from friends and family, she found at Baylor there was 'an unwritten law' that players shouldn't discuss their sexual preferences.

Speaking to ESPN in May, she recalled: '... 
it was just kind of, like, one of those things, you know, just don't do 
it. They kind of tried to make it, like, 'Why put your business out on 
the street like that?'"

The 6-foot-8 basketball champion 
acknowledged that she is gay in the media in April and talked about 
being bullied while growing up.

'It was hard. Just being picked on for 
being different. Just being bigger, my sexuality, everything,' 
Griner told Sports Illustrated. 'I overcame it and got over it. Definitely something that I am 
very passionate about.

In the ESPN interview she explained that when Kim Mulkey recruited her, she was honest about who she was.

'I told Coach [Mulkey] when she was 
recruiting me. I was like, "I'm gay. I hope that's not a problem," and 
she told me that it wasn't,' Griner said. 'I mean, my teammates knew, 
obviously they all knew. Everybody knew about it.'

But when one of Griner's tweets to an
ex-girlfriend was noticed by an staffer at Baylor, she was told to take
the post down by 'someone in the office.'

'It was a recruiting thing,' Griner 
added. 'The coaches thought that if it seemed like they condoned it, 
people wouldn't let their kids come play for Baylor.'

Baylor University is a rigidly 
Baptist university in Texas that discourages students from participating
in 'advocacy groups which promote understandings of sexuality that are 
contrary to biblical teaching.'

Mulkey did not comment directly in 
response to Griner's remarks but said in a statement earlier in May: 
'Brittney Griner represented Baylor University proudly on and off the 
basketball court, and she leaves behind an incredible legacy.

'I cannot comment on personal matters
surrounding any of our student-athletes, but I can tell you Brittney 
will always be a celebrated member of the Baylor family.'

In an interview in April, when asked about why more female athletes were out as opposed to men, Griner replied: 'I really couldn't give an answer on why that's so different. Being one that's out, it's just being who you are.'

'Don't worry about what other people are going to say because they're 
always going to say something.

'But if you're just true to yourself, let 
that shine through. Don't hide who you really are,' she continued.

The star then told Sports Illustrated that she doesn't think her fame made it harder to come out.

'It really wasn't too difficult. I wouldn't say I was hiding or 
anything like that,' Griner said. 'I've always been open about who I am 
and my sexuality, so it wasn't hard at all.

'If I can show that I'm out 
and I'm fine and everything's OK, then hopefully the younger generation 
will definitely feel the same way.'
