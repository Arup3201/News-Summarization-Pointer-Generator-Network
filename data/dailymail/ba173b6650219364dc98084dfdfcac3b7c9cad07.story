Mothers who undergo weight-loss surgery are less likely to have obese children because it affects the baby's genes in the womb, according to new research.

It has been known for some time that obese mothers tend to have overweight children, but until now it was thought to be solely linked to lifestyle factors such as poor diet and lack of exercise.

But the new study discovered that children born to mothers who underwent weight-loss surgery possessed genes that worked differently to their older siblings who were born before the mother underwent the procedure.

Pregnant women who are obese expose their babies to higher levels of sugar and fat which in turn affects their genes. It is thought that genes play an important role in deciding whether a person goes on to be overweight

Experts discovered that children born after their mother lost a large amount of weight were slimmer than their siblings. They also had fewer risk factors for diabetes or heart disease later in life. 

Clearly diet and exercise play a huge role in how large a child grows up to be, but the findings suggest that children born after their mother's surgery might have an advantage.

'The impact on the genes, you will see the impact for the rest of your life,' said Dr. Marie-Claude Vohl of Laval University in Quebec City, who led the research.

Experts said that it isn't that a mother passes on different genes, but how those genes operate in her child's body.

Scientists found that children born before a mother's weight-loss surgery were more likely to be overweight

Researchers took blood samples from children born to 20 women before and after complex 
surgery that shrank their stomachs and rerouted digestion, so they absorbed
less fat and calories. On average, they lost about 100 pounds.

After comparing chemical tags in more than 5,600 genes 
between the younger and older siblings, they found significant differences
in the activity of certain genes clustered in pathways known to affect 
blood sugar metabolism and heart disease risk.

Dr. John Kral of New York's SUNY Downstate 
Medical Center, who co-authored the study, said that foetuses
are 'marinated, and they're differently marinated' depending on a mother's weight and health.

He explained that factors inside the womb seem to affect the 'dimmer switches' that develop on a foetus' genes - chemical changes that make genes speed up or slow down or switch on and off.

Overweight mothers have higher levels of sugar and fat in the bloodstream, which travels to the womb and the baby inside.

This
may do more than overstimulate fetal growth. Scientists know that 
certain molecules regulate gene activity, attaching like chemical tags.

Dr. Susan Murphy of Duke University, who was not involved in the Canadian research but studies uterine effects on later health, said it made biological sense that the earliest nutritional environment could affect a developing metabolism, although she cautions that healthier family habits after a mother's surgery may play a role, too. 

The research has implications far beyond the relatively few women who take the drastic step of gastric bypass surgery before having a baby.

Dr Murphy added that obesity is 'not just impacting your life, it's impacting your child.'

All mothers put on weight during pregnancy. Over a third of any extra weight will come from the baby, the placenta and the amniotic fluid. On average, the baby, placenta and amniotic fluid will total 4.8kg (10lb 9oz).

The rest of the weight can be accounted for by the changes that happen in the mother's body while pregnant.

The womb grows dramatically and weighs an extra 0.9kg (2lb), blood volume increases and weighs an extra 1.2kg (2.6lb), extra fluid in the body weighs about 1.2kg (2.6lb), breasts weigh an extra 0.4kg (0.9lb) and extra fat, about 4kg (8.8lb), will be stored to give energy for breastfeeding.

By the end of pregnancy, a woman may weigh about 12.5kg (27.6lb) more than she did before you became pregnant.

There are no official guidelines for weight gain in pregnancy in the UK, although it is advised that women who are normal weight at the start of pregnancy should gain 25lb (11.3kg) to 35lb (15.8kg)

Those who already are obese should gain no more than 11lb (4.9kg) to 20lb (9.1kg).

Overweight mothers-to-be fall in the middle.
