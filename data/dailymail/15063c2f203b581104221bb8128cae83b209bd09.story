It was a heart-warming rags-to-riches story of a homeless man told he was the lucky recipient of a $100,000 windfall.

But the tragic background behind Max Melitzer's decline into homelessness is that his wife and two friends were killed in a car crash 21 years ago.

Friend Karol Behling said Mr Melitzer was driving when the family tragedy happened and it may have led to his life on the streets of Salt Lake City, Utah.

A private investigator tracked down Mr Melitzer, 65, last week to deliver the life-altering news of the inheritance left by a brother who died of cancer.

Ms Behling said Mr Melitzer was deeply affected by the death of his wife, Janice, and his life on the streets seemed to begin after the accident.

Mr Melitzer has since left Utah to reunite with his family in New York, who he hadn't seen in more than ten years.

‘He was very much in love with his wife, I believe,' Ms Behling said. 'And it was really hard for him - one, to have her gone and, two, to have been driving.'

‘I’m sure that affected him a lot, and I'm sure he missed his wife a lot,’ she told the Deseret News.

Mr Melitzer was driving through Wyoming in July 1990 when he lost control of his car, killing his wife and two passengers.

Behling said she recalls Mr Melitzer 
lost his apartment after the crash and bounced from place to place 
between Ogden and Salt Lake City.

Two months ago the Melitzer family hired private investigator David Lundberg to track down Max.

Neither Mr Lundberg nor the family's law firm 
have disclosed the amount Mr Melitzer will receive, but it is believed 
to be around $100,000.

‘He'd have money where he could take care of himself or hire someone to take care of him,’ Mr Lundberg said.

‘Apparently, he does have some emotional issues. The family just wants to make sure he's set up and he's taken care of.’

It took his cousin, Richard Goldfarb, more than a year to find Max, finally fulfilling his brother's deathbed request.

The down-and-out was left 'in shock' 
when Mr Lundberg told him he stands to inherit just over $100,000 from 
his brother, Morris, who he hadn't seen in 15 years.

He was discovered wandering around a park in Salt Lake City last Friday, pushing his shopping cart in front of him.

Mr Goldfarb, the Melitzers' first cousin, said he was 'tickled pink' to have finally found Max.

He told MailOnline: 'He ate his first seafood in over 25 years when Mr Lundberg took him out for dinner.

‘(The windfall) is not a fortune, but
to him it'll feel like a million dollars. I am tickled pink, now I 
don't have to worry about finding him anymore.

'The family are all tickled pink, 
we're all very happy that we have finally found him, and got him out of 
the life he has been living.'
