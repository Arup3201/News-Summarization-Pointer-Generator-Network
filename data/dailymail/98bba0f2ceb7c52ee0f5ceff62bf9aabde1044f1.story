A California man has claimed that he was sacked from his job because he complained to Comcast about being overcharged on his cable bill.

Conal O'Rourke, who worked at accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), alleged that the cable giant charged him more than $1,800 for equipment that he did not order and never received.  

Following a year-long dispute with the firm, during which his unpaid bills were turned over to a collections agency, he contacted its chief accounting officer and controller, Lawrence Salva.

Soon after speaking with Mr Salva's assistant, his employer - which does consulting work for Comcast - reportedly called him in for an internal ethics investigation. He was fired a week later.

Now, Mr O'Rourke has sent a letter to the firm, via his attorney Maureen Ryan, in which he threatened to sue Comcast, the largest broadcasting and cable firm in the world by revenue.

The document also stated that the customer should be given 'a full retraction and apology, his re-employment with his former employer and $100,312.50' by next Tuesday.

Today, Mr O'Rourke told CNN he initially had a 'pleasant' telephone conversation with Comcast's corporate office, during which he told the firm its billing practices should be investigated.

However, he said the chat quickly turned 'aggressive', saying: 'I don't know how I could have handled any differently because I tried for months and months to just have somebody just look at my bill.'

In a letter to Ms Ryan, Comcast said it had notified Pwc that a person claiming to be an employee had yelled at cable firm's workers who had tried to assist him during the call.

It added that Mr O'Rourke had attempted to use his employment at PwC as leverage, but Ms Ryan argued: 'He didn't have any improper leverage and he didn't use it.'

She added: They went to his employer and said he had violated accounting ethics. That's not a minor charge to make.'

Earlier this week, Comcast's new vice president of customer experience, Charlie Herrin, who was hired to 'improve' the firm's service, issued a public apology to Mr O'Rourke.

In the apology, published on Comcast's website, he admitted the customer's service problems were completely unacceptable, but denied that the firm sought to have him fired.

He wrote: 'What happened with Mr. O’Rourke's service is completely unacceptable. Despite our attempts to address Mr. O’Rourke’s issues, we simply dropped the ball and did not make things right.

'Mr. O’Rourke deserves another apology from us and we’re making this one publicly. We also want to clarify that nobody at Comcast asked for him to be fired.

Denying the claims: In the apology (pictured), published on Comcast's website, Mr Herrin admitted that Mr O'Rourke's service problems were completely unacceptable, but denied the firm sought to have him fired

'We’re also determined to get to the bottom of exactly what happened with his service, figure out what went wrong at every point along the way, and fix any underlying issues.' 

PwC told the TV station that Mr O'Rourke, from San Jose, had been sacked from the firm after violating its standards and practices.

However, Mr O'Rourke, who claims his billing problems go back to at least February 2013, has denied any ethics violations or telling Comcast that he worked for PwC.
