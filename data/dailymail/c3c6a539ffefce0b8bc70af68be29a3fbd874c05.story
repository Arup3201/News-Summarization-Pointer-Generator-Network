A strange ghost town that spent a quarter of a century under water is coming up for air again in the Argentinian farmlands southwest of Buenos Aires.

Epecuen was once a bustling little lakeside resort, where 1,500 people served 20,000 tourists a season.

But disaster struck when the town was flooded without warning after a long period of heavy rains finally sent the lagoon bursting over its banks, submerging the small community in 1985.

On November 10, 1985, a particularly heavy rainstorm followed a series of wet winters, and the lake overflowed its banks. Above, buildings lie in ruins in the once-bustling Argentinian town

During Argentina's golden age, the same trains that carried grain to the outside world brought visitors from the capital to relax in Epecuen's saltwater baths and spas. Above graves lie lopsided from flood damage

In the floods of 1985, water burst through a retaining wall and spilled into the lakeside streets

During Argentina's golden age, the 
same trains that carried grain to the outside world brought visitors 
from the capital to relax in Epecuen's saltwater baths and spas.

The saltwater lake was particularly attractive because it has 10 times more salt than the ocean, making the water buoyant.

A local legend holds that the lake was formed by the tears of a great Chief crying for
 the pain of his beloved.

Tourists, especially people from Buenos Aires' large Jewish community, enjoyed floating in the water, which reminded them of the Dead Sea in Israel.

The town had 280 businesses, including 
lodges, guesthouses, hotels and businesses, centred around the tourist trade.

Then, on November 10, 1985, a particularly heavy rainstorm followed a series of wet winters, and the lake overflowed its banks.

Water burst through a retaining wall and spilled into the lakeside streets.

People fled with what they could, and within days their homes were submerged under nearly 10 meters (33 feet) of corrosive saltwater.

'I had a bunch of cats and dogs, and they ran away a couple days before 
the flood and I never saw them again,' said one former resident, Norma Berg.

She lived in the town until the flood forced her family to desert their home.

'I think my pets could feel that the water was coming,' she added.

Now the water has mostly receded, exposing what looks like a scene from a movie about the end of the world.

The town hasn't been rebuilt but it has become a tourist destination again, for people willing to drive at least six hours from Buenos Aires to get there, along 340 miles (550km) of narrow country roads.

People come to see the rusted hulks of automobiles and furniture, crumbled homes and broken appliances.

They climb staircases that lead nowhere and wander through a graveyard where the water toppled headstones and exposed tombs to the elements.

It's a bizarre, post-apocalyptic landscape that captures a traumatic moment in time.

One man refused to leave. Pablo Novak, now 82, still lives on the edge of the town, welcoming people who wander into the wrecked streets.

'Whoever passes nearby cannot go without coming to visit here,' Novak said.

'It's getting more people to the area, as they come to see the ruins.'

When the flood came, people fled with what they could, and within days their homes were submerged under nearly 10 metres (33 feet) of corrosive saltwater. Above, a young tourist stands on stairs protruding from the rubble of homes in Epecuen

He now spends his days riding around the ruins on his bike.

Feeding his wood kitchen at his house, Novak added: 'I am OK here. I am just alone. I read the newspaper. And I always think of the town's golden days.'

Many residents of Epecuen fled to nearby Carhue, another lakeside town, and built new hotels and spas, promising relaxing getaways featuring saltwater and mud facials.

'Not only do we have Epecuen with the ruins and its natural wealth, but we also can increasingly offer other alternatives,' said Javier Andres, the local tourism director.

The spooky town provided the perfect backdrop to 2010 film And Soon The Darkness - a thriller starring Karl Urban.

In the 1970s more rain than usual was delivered to the surrounding hills and Lago Epecuen began to swell. In 1985, the salty waters broke through the clay dam, and Villa Epecuen was flooded
