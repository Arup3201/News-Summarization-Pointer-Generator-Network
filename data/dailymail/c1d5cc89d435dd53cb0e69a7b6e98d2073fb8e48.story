Florida mother is looking at her current jail time as a break from parenthood.

Monique Miller, 34, appeared before a judge on Tuesday after allegedly throwing her baby from her car in North Miami Beach, Florida.

When the judge ordered her to stay away from her child, she seemed only happy to oblige. 

'OK, I need a break anyway,' she said.

Miller was also ordered on Tuesday to take all of her prescribed medications 

Cops allegedly tried to pull Miller over Monday afternoon during a routine traffic stop,when the mother was driving with her baby on her lap. 

Miller at first refused, but when she eventually complied she started yelling obscenities at officers and then tossed her baby out the window. 

Luckily an officer was able to catch the baby safely. 

It's unclear how old the baby is. 

Miller was arrested in the incident, in which she also kicked the cop's car door, causing the door to slam into his head. 

The mother faces charges of child neglect, criminal mischief and battery on a law enforcement officer. 

As of Wednesday, she remained in jail on $7,500 bond. 

In addition to being ordered to stay away from her child, Miller was also told to take prescribed medications.
