A cunning burglar stole £14,500 after breaking into a supermarket’s roof space and collecting cash as it passed through a vacuum tube from the cash register to the cash office.

Michael Bryon intercepted 23 plastic pods from Sainsbury's in Suffolk, before escaping with the takings which staff took two hours to notice were missing.

The 35-year-old of Cannock, Staffordshire, denied burglary the supermarket on January 11 this year, but was found guilty at Ipswich Crown Court yesterday and was sentenced to four years jail.

Michael Bryon was jailed for four years for stealing £14,500 from cash 'pods' while they passed from a Sainsbury's cash register in Bury St Edmunds to their cash office

Bryon emptied the tubes of cash as they passed by him; he was jailed in 2010 for committing a similar crime

Prosecutor Lindsay Cox said it was not known if Bryon had carried out the thefts alone or as part of a gang. 

He was caught after his DNA was found on a piece of tape which was used to form a seal to maintain the air flow on the pipe during the theft.

The jury was told Bryon was jailed for an almost identical offence in 2010 when £10,400 was taken from an air flow system at a Tesco's store in Swindon, Wiltshire.

On that occasion, he pleaded guilty to burglary and claimed he had only acted as a driver.

Mr Cox described the burglary as 'an interesting form of theft'.

Bryon denied being involved and said he could not remember where he had been on January 11.
