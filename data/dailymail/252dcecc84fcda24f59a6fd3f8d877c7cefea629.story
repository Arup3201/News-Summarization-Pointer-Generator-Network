In the midst of all the horrific riot photos emerging from Istanbul, there is one image that has brightened the horizon... the hipster dog.

The sunglasses-wearing bulldog has been snapped by several people riding on a scooter with his owner around Takism Square during the recent protests.

His attire is simple - he wears white sunglasses with black lenses and a black collar.

The identity of the dog and his owner is currently unknown, but the pair have caused a stir on social media.

His photo has spread across Twitter and one user labelled him as 'The Riot Dog of Istanbul!'

A protestor told BuzzFeed that the dog and his owner are park regulars and have been seen around Turkey's largest city a few times.

He has been pictured sleeping with his owner on the street pavements and looks like he is always happy to pose.

He either sits up front with his owner or if he is feeling lazy, rides pillion.

But he is no adverse to a bit of stirring - the dog is often seen dressed in a Turkish football shirt, barking at park-goers wearing the rival soccer teams strip.
