The husband of the 36-year-old Brooklyn teacher charged with having repeated statutory trysts with one of her high school students has said their marriage is as strong as ever.

Jimmy Lathrop, 39, said his relationship with his wife Erin Saya, who is accused of statutory rape, has not suffered following the shocking allegations and denied divorce rumours.

'We’re doing fine. We’re doing awesome,' Mr Lathrop told the New York Post yesterday. 'No, there’s nothing true about that, at all. We’re not getting a divorce.'

Sayar also denied marital problems and
declared her love for her husband. 'My husband is a great man, and I 
love him very much,' she said. 'There is no divorce in our future.'

Sayar revealed that she might be 
returning to James Madison High School in Brooklyn where the alleged illicit
encounters occurred, adding that her colleagues were supporting her. 
'I’ve spent my entire teaching career there, since 2000, and some of my 
best friends are there,' she said.

'I’ve heard from them, and they’re 
rooting for me. I have no plan on moving. It’s a great school. It’s a 
beautiful school with highly intelligent teachers and mostly wonderful 
students.

'I have a beautiful family and 
beautiful friends and a gorgeous daughter. I’m generally a positive and 
happy person, so I’m just really hoping for the best for everyone 
involved in this, actually.'

But friends and family of the couple have painted a different picture. A
source had told the New York Post that Lathrop is looking for a lawyer to help him divorce his wife.

He was seen this week at Brooklyn 
Criminal Court, wearing a fedora and glasses, and walking several steps 
ahead of his wife, who looked disheveled in a bright pink track suit.

The source told the Post: ‘He’s very angry, he’s very embarrassed,’ adding that Mr Lathrop is out looking for a divorce attorney.

‘I don’ think this marriage will last,’ the source told the newspaper.

Mother-of-one Sayar, who is accused of seducing football player Kevin Eng, 16, while she was a teacher at the Brooklyn school, appeared in court this week for arraignment.

Sayar was released on $10,000 bond after turned herself into the NYPD Special Victims Squad and was charged with eight counts of third-degree rape and criminal sexual conduct.

Kevin is still a student at the high school.

As Judge Kevin McGrath set bail, he also issued an order of protection for the student.

Sayar - who is facing more than four 
years in jail - was supposed to be tutoring the footballer in her office
while his teammates were using the weight room next door.

A chaotic scene unfolded outside the courthouse as reporters and camera crew surrounded Sayar and her husband as they left after the woman was released from jail.

The pair refused to speak with reporters.

Sayar remained silent and smirked 
slightly at times as she walked dressed in a pink-hooded sweatshirt, 
black pants and white sneakers with pink shoelaces.

Instead, Sayar got into a sedan and returned to her home. Mr Lathrop also dismissed news crews wearing a top hat and his wedding ring.

The parents of the 16-year-old also filed a $10million lawsuit against the married English teacher.

According to the Post, Kevin was boasting about the sexual trysts on Facebook and to other students in detention.

Football teammate Eddie Reid, 16, said they quickly grew suspicious, telling the Post: 'We had weight training every day in 
sixth period, but instead of going to the weight room, Kevin was going 
to her office — and the door was locked.

'People would go to the door and try and open it. She’d just yell "Go to class!" and "Get out of the hallway!",' Reid said.

The lawyer representing Eng is 
claiming his client was traumatized by what happened and that it left him
the 'subject of scorn and ridicule'.

But other students said he was proud of the affair.

The school found out about the alleged sexual relationship when Kevin's girlfriend became suspicious last November.

After hacking Eng's Facebook account,
the girl found messages he had sent to Sayar which read, 'I love you so
much' and 'I always loved you, since last year'.

Sayar replied: 'Oh no — I’m not putting myself out there again. I made that mistake last night and you couldn’t handle it.'

Despite this, the teacher gave the boy her mobile number and ordered him to delete their conversations.

Devastated, the girl informed school officials of the pair's exchanges, and confronted her boyfriend.

According to the school's report, Eng admitted having oral sex and intercourse with Sayar between eight to 12 times.

The New York Post reports that the lovers exchanged an incredible 3,856 text messages over a 17-day period in December, an average of 227 per day.

One midnight tryst apparently saw Sayar pick the boy up from his house in her car.

'Eventually, they began kissing and then engaged in sexual intercourse and oral sex inside the SUV,' the report said, adding that the boy had described tattoos on intimate parts of Sayar’s body.

A spokesman for the Department of 
Education said Sayar, who earns just over $78,000 (£50,000) a year, is 
still technically employed at the school, although she was removed from 
the classroom in January.

'We had weight training every day in 
sixth period, but instead of going to the weight room, Kevin was going 
to her office - and the door was locked'

The school investigators have submitted their report to Brooklyn's District Attorney Charles Hynes, strongly recommending she be fired.

Eng, who is now 17, is still a pupil at the school.

The sordid allegations are not the first to hit James Madison High School, christened 'Horndog High' after its past sex scandals.

Language teachers Cindy Mauro and Alini Brito were dismissed from their posts after an alleged lesbian romp in a school classroom in November 2009 - a claim they both denied.

Prior to that, 29-year-old English teacher Craig Roffman was sacked and arrested in 2005 after he was found emailing child pornography.
