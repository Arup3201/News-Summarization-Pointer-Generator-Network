Southern Britain was bracing itself for floods and chaos today as a band of torrential rain and thundery storms swept in from the Atlantic.

The
Met Office put out a yellow weather warning, saying the West 
Country is first in the firing line and could be swamped by the equivalent of early two 
inches of rain in just three hours.

A spokesman said: 'Areas of heavy, thundery rain will spread 
into southern and south-western parts of England and Wales today, with 
20-25mm of rain possible within an hour and 40mm within three hours.

'This
warning will be kept under close review and updated as necessary, with 
the possibility that it may need to be extended into Friday.'

Claire Endean's furniture showroom in St Austell, Cornwall, has been hit by floods three times in the last couple of years.

'You just want to go home and cry,' she said.

'It isn't your home, but because
this is where you technically live eight hours a day, it is just 
heart-breaking when you see all your nice clean, lovely shop getting 
covered in water and mud.'

Firefighters have already been called to pump out flood water from two hotels in the exclusive coastal town of St Mawes in Cornwall, an area where many celebrities and 
politicians have holiday homes.

Traffic ground to a halt on the A39 
in Truro earlier today tue to heaving flooding, with the road described 
as 'just passable' in places.

Huge
queues built up as motorists attempted to get through. More flooding 
was reported on the B3277 between St Agnes and Chiverton Cross.

Cornwall Council has put staff on standby and advised residents to stock up on sandbags, which can be obtained from builders merchants and hardware stores, to protect their homes from flooding.

It has also advised people to check with the Environment Agency, either on their website or by calling the floodline on 0845 9881188, to find out if their property is at risk from flooding.

A spokesman said: 'During the 
floods, which took place last year, a number of householders reported 
difficulties in obtaining sandbags when the heavy rain affected their 
local area. 

'As neither 
the Council nor the Environment Agency has a statutory duty to provide 
sandbags, anyone whose property is prone to flooding should ensure they 
have a supply of sandbags ready to protect their home or business should
they need to.

'Officers 
from Cornwall Council's Highways, Environment, Fire and Rescue and 
Emergency Management services will be monitoring the situation closely 
and are on standby to deal with any problems.

'Local
communities are also encouraged to check with vulnerable neighbours in 
case they need help with obtaining flood protection materials.

'Agencies
are asking people to follow the advice on dealing with the potential 
heavy rainfall, and warn people not to drive through any flood water.'

In Scotland, traffic ground to a halt when 100 tonnes of debris poured onto the A83 following a landslide.

Serious: Traffic was halted in Argyll when a landslide dumped 100 tonnes of debris on the A83

It followed more than 26mm of rainfall overnight in Argyll, with much of it coming between 6am and 9am.

First Minister Alex Salmond described it as a 'serious and developing situation'.

The road has now been closed six times since December 2011, and roads management firm BEAR Scotland called in specialists to clear the area after heavy rain brought rocks and mud from a nearby hill on to the road surface.

Two parts of the road were affected and engineers are to remain at the site near the Rest and Be Thankful, in Argyll, overnight with more rain expected.

Concrete retaining blocks are to be fitted and BEAR will patrol the road to check for any danger.

Developing: First Minister Alex Salmond described the landslide as 'serious'

Brian Gordon, BEAR Scotland's managing
director, said: 'Our team has worked flat out in difficult conditions 
to re-open the road. We are doing so with traffic controls and a number 
of other safety measures in place given the on-going poor weather 
forecast.

'As always the 
safety of motorists is our utmost priority and we will ask anyone 
experiencing delays to be patient while we continue to monitor the 
situation throughout the night.'

Argyll
and Bute Council leader Dick Walsh said there are concerns about the 
route with businesses relying on it for deliveries and trade.

He
said: 'Following today's closure of the A83 trunk road, we have written
to Transport Scotland seeking confirmation of the suitability of the 
risk assessment and contingency planning for the A82 works at Pulpit 
Rock.

'The people who visit,
live and work in Argyll and Bute depend on these lifeline routes and we
need to ensure that they are able to continue to go about their 
business.

'We will, of 
course, offer any assistance that we can to Transport Scotland and work 
closely with them and the police to find the best possible solution for 
everyone.'

Transport Minister Keith Brown said: 'We know that the A83 is a vital route for people living and working in Argyll and Bute and our operating company, BEAR Scotland, has deployed all of its resources to clear the hundred tonnes of rock and mud from the road at Glen Kinglas as quickly as possible.

'Landslides are naturally occurring events, we can't stop them happening but we can lessen the impact and we have been making improvements, not only to our processes but also through engineering. There are no overnight solutions to the issue but we are committed to a programme of on-going works to remedy the situation.

'We have invested £3.7m in mitigation measures on the A83 including protective netting, a new culvert and drainage system at the site of a previous landslide and geotechnical monitoring equipment.

'This area at Glen Kinglas is part of the further studies we are undertaking on the A83 to find solutions to the unique challenges that the route poses.'
