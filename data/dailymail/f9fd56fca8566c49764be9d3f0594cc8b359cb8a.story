On one of her regular visits to her mother’s care home, Claudette Watson noticed something wasn’t right.

Her mother Maud Sappleton, 71, suffered from Alzheimer’s and had moved into the home five months earlier.

Despite her dementia, when Maud went to Seabrooke Manor Residential and Nursing Home in Ilford, Essex, in May 2010, she was still a lively woman, enjoying a joke with her family. Crucially, she was also able to walk around quite freely.

Bed sores can be the result of nursing care provided by unqualified staff, who may fail to recognise or report signs of potentially serious skin problems, say experts

Within a few months, however, the former nursing assistant had lost mobility. By October, she spent most of her time in a chair and, although her children didn’t initially know it, was suffering from at least one bed sore (also known as a pressure sore or pressure ulcer). By November, she was largely bedridden, and her limbs were very stiff.

‘My brother and I didn’t make the connection at the time, but I’d noticed an odour like rotting flesh,’ says Claudette, 54, a charity chief executive from Woolwich, South London. ‘We wondered if they were washing her properly, but when we brought it up with the staff, they said it was nothing.

‘Eventually, they told us she had a “sore”, but they’d been looking at it.’

Then in early January, Maud was moved from the residential side of the building to the nursing unit, where she was found to have a number of grade-four bed sores — the most severe kind — on her left hip, right hip and buttocks.

Her condition continued to deteriorate, and she was admitted to hospital suffering kidney failure, and sepsis (blood poisoning), related to the bed sores. She died on  March 3, 2011, with seven bed sores, including two grade three, and one grade four.

Bed sores occur when a patient lies immobile for a period of time, unable to get up and move around or shift their weight.

The pressure disrupts the flow of 
blood through the skin, so it becomes starved of oxygen and nutrients 
and begins to break down, leading to an ulcer forming. These are often 
found on the heel, back and elbows.

There
 are four grades: a reddening or bruising of the skin is classed as 
grade one; broken skin and shallow ulceration, grade two; and large, 
deep ulceration, grade three.

Grade
 four ulcers are so deep that in many cases the skin and muscle has 
completely worn away, revealing bone, and sometimes internal organs. The
 most severe ulcers are very difficult to heal and can lead to a fatal 
infection or life-threatening complications such as gangrene or blood 
poisoning.

Experienced nursing staff: Guidelines from the National Institute for health and Care Excellence say any patient considered at risk of bed sores should be turned regularly and put on a specially designed foam or electrically powered air mattress (posed by model)

Some 540 hospital patients and 227 care home residents’ deaths had bed sores as a contributing factor in 2011, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics, while bed sores were also the main cause of death for another 78 hospital patients (and 39 care home residents) that year.

Even when the sores don’t kill the patient, they can cause terrible pain, and lead to immobility.

‘Pressure sores acquired in care homes or hospitals of grade three or four are preventable through good, basic nursing care,’ says Peter Walsh, chief executive of  the Action Against Medical Accidents charity. This means regularly ‘turning’ the patient.  An estimated half a million people in the UK develop bed sores each year. And shocking new figures from the NHS show that one in 20 patients has them. The statistics were based on data collected from nearly 200,000 patients in July this year (most of these were in hospital, a small proportion in residential care homes and nursing homes).

‘It’s quite scandalous that bed sores are being allowed to happen at such an alarming rate,’ says Mr Walsh. ‘The cost in pain and misery and the cost to the NHS in treatment are enormous and it’s a sign of neglectful care and under-staffing.’

Bed sores are estimated to cost the NHS up to £2 billion a year in care costs. To tackle the problem, it was announced last year the sores would be included in a list of 60 ‘patient outcome measures’ used to assess quality of care — with hospitals losing some of their budget if they fail to meet targets.

The Department of Health points out that the shocking new data is actually an improvement, with a smaller proportion (5.1 per cent) of patients suffering bed sores in July, compared with the  7 per cent affected in April, 2012.

But Jane Nixon, professor of tissue viability at the University of Leeds and a leading researcher on the subject, says while the NHS focus on bed sore prevention has had a big impact, the data is not reliable. ‘There’s no standard methodology in the way it is collected. The requirements vary between trusts and the methods have changed over time,’ she says.

Professor Nixon says some trusts only report the number of patients with sores visited by district nurses on the one day the data is meant to be collected. This means the number of patients with pressure ulcers reported each month is not reliable.

There has also been a trend in reclassifying pressure ulcers as ‘incontinence lesions’ or if they’re on the heel, diabetic foot ulcers, to keep figures down.

One factor that can lead to bed sores, says Professor Nixon, is that a lot of basic nursing care is provided by unqualified staff, who may fail to recognise or report signs of potentially serious skin problems.

Guidelines from the National Institute for health and Care Excellence (NICE) say any patient considered at risk of bed sores is meant to be turned regularly and put on a specially designed foam or electrically powered air mattress.

But Professor Nixon says the existence of these mattresses can mean people think there’s no need to turn a patient using them.

A post-mortem report registered Maud’s bed sores and dementia as secondary causes of death — the primary cause was pneumonia.

A council investigation found the home failed in its duty of care towards her. It noted that despite her being assessed upon admission as being at risk of developing the sores, no plan was carried out to keep Maud’s skin healthy.

Owner Bupa care homes settled with Maud’s family out of court, admitting it had breached its duty of care. It agreed to pay £20,000 compensation plus legal costs.

According to Ruth Hewitt, solicitor and medical negligence specialist at Bolt Burdon Kemp, the law firm who handled Claudette’s claim, bed sores are one of the most common types of medical negligence cases.

‘Most serious pressure sores should be avoidable and it is inexcusable that Mrs Sappleton was found to be suffering with so many at the time of her death,’ she says.

‘A main issue seems to be a lack of training, which meant staff at the home wrongly diagnosed her skin condition [as a skin tear] and failed to put in place a skin integrity plan at an early stage, which might have prevented her condition from worsening.’

Claudette says: ‘Putting a plan in place to prevent a patient at risk of developing bed sores seems a very simple thing to do. To not do that and then have these things develop is very upsetting.’

She adds: ‘Bupa is a good name, associated with quality care, so it sticks in your throat when things like this occur.

There's no standard methodology in the way the information is collected. Requirements vary between trusts and the methods have changed over time (picture posed by model)

‘When you suffer from Alzheimer’s you can’t communicate well so I’m sure there was a lot of pain there, which is heartbreaking.’

Richard Jackson, operations director for Bupa Care Services, said: ‘Mrs Sappleton was unwell when she was admitted to our residential unit in 2010 and we transferred her into our nursing unit for increased care and support. Unfortunately, her health deteriorated further and faster than we expected.

‘We fully accept that we did not transfer her to the nursing unit as quickly as we should have done and, on this occasion, we did not provide the high standard of care to Mrs Sappleton that we all expect.

‘I would like to again apologise to Mrs Sappleton’s family and would also like to reassure them we took immediate action by commissioning a full investigation into the home.

‘Following that, we retrained our people and now carry out six-monthly refresher training on skin care and moving vulnerable people, to prevent pressure ulcers.’
