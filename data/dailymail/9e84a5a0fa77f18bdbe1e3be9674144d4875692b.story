An allotment holder who has refused to grow vegetables has lost a legal battle to be allowed to stay on his land.

Michael Rock decided to plant fruit trees after he found himself with so many spare vegetables that he had to throw them away.

After Hastings Borough Council won the right to evict him from his plot last week, he pledged to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights and insisted: 'This is not over.'

Battle: Michael Rock has been thrown off his allotment because he is only growing fruit trees

Mr Rock, 61, appeared at Hastings County Court last week for his suit against the council, which owns Bembrook Allotments in East Sussex.

The writer has had his plot at the site for six years, and in 2008 decided to stop growing vegetables when he found himself with so many potatoes, leeks and onions that he could neither eat them nor give them away.

Legal battle: Mr Rock is hoping to take his case to the European Court of Human Rights

To replace them, he paid £600 for 13 fruit trees, planting a mixture of pear, plum, apple, cherry and apricot trees.

But when council workers carried out a 'plot inspection', they told Mr Rock he was not 'cultivating the land properly', and warned him he must grow vegetables again if he did not want to be evicted from the allotment.

Council rules introduced last year 
dictate that three quarters of every plot should be 'planted with 
productive crops or other plants', in order to prevent plot holders from
neglected the highly sought-after land.

Clive
Read, a landscape technician for the council, told the hearing last 
week: 'I don't believe that growing fruit trees as a monoculture is an 
appropriate use of an allotment.'

Mr
Rock, who represented himself in court, said he had followed 'expert 
advice' in growing his fruit trees, and that the contract he signed with
the council in 2007 did not say he wasn't allowed to grow only fruit 
trees.

He said he had 
even started growing ferns, roses and artichokes to 'meet the council 
half-way', but told the court: 'I feel like I'm a spider in the room 
that you want to crush because you don't like the look of me.'

District
Judge Geoffrey Smith said the argument came down to a 'dispute over the
fundamental meaning of the word cultivation' and said it was a 
'difficult case'.

In the end, however, the judge sided with the council, telling the court: 'I find as a fact that the cultivation of 13 fruit trees on that area of land with only grass in between them is not something which meets the stipulation of 75 per cent cultivation within two years.'

Mr Rock was ordered to pay £750 in court costs and told to be off the land in two months unless he met council cultivation rules.

Speaking to the Hastings Observer after the case, Mr Rock pledged to take his case to a higher court, saying: 'This is not over. I'm not evicted yet and I will appeal. I will take it to the European Court of Human Rights if necessary.

'I hope in the end to win the case and for the council to be more understanding of the way people live their lives.'

A spokesman for the council said previously: 'The rules were agreed unanimously and we believe they are fair and reasonable and have the support of the vast majority of allotment holders.

'The major change is the introduction of rules which help us ensure that tenants do cultivate their plots.'
