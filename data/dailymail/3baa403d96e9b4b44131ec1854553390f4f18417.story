A host of Manchester United legends gathered for the funeral of Sandy Busby - the son of former Old Trafford manager Sir Matt - on Friday.

Sir Alex Ferguson, Bryan Robson and Steve Bruce were among the mourners for the service held in Chorlton, Manchester as were United icons Sir Bobby Charlton and Denis Law.

Tributes poured in for Busby after the 76-year-old died suddenly at his home in Hale Barns on Monday evening after a reported heart attack.

United chief executive Ed Woodward, who also attended Friday's funeral, said in a statement: 'I am shocked and saddened by news of Sandy's death. He was such a genuine person who had a deep and rich love for the club that his father did so much to establish in the hearts of millions around the world.

'Sandy understood better than almost anyone what the United way means and his enthusiasm, his wit and his affection for the club will be sorely missed.

'Our thoughts go out to Irene and his family at such a sad time.' 

Former United star Norman Whiteside took to Twitter to express his condolences.

He said: 'So sorry to hear about the passing of Sandy Busby. What a lovely gent RIP.'

TV presenter and United fan Eamonn Holmes added: 'Sandy Busby's death so unexpected. Thoughts to his lovely family.'

Sandy remained a keen supporter of the club and lent his full backing of new manager Louis van Gaal's appointment this summer.

When asked by Sportsmail if his father would enjoy Van Gaal's brand of football, Sandy Busby was effusive in his support of the Dutchman.

He said: 'Oh, I'm sure he would. I'm sure he would. And please God he does.

'This club is enormous, it's an enormous club. It's got a great support throughout the world and it would be great to see Mr Van Gaal succeed and I'm sure he will.

'From the way he's talking, he's going to play attacking football and that's all we want. It's what this club stands for.'
