Charges: Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed is accused of breaching an anti-terror court order 20 times

The terror suspect who went on the run disguised in a burka was facing 20 different charges for breaching court orders at the time he disappeared, it emerged today.

Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed has been missing for a week, and today a warrant was issued for his arrest after he failed to attend a court hearing about a terrorism prevention and investigation measure which was imposed on him.

He is currently suing the Government over claims he was tortured in Somalia, but lawyers today suggested that the proceedings should be blocked while he is still on the run.

Mohamed, 27, was seen leaving a mosque in West London last Friday dressed in a burka, and has not been located since after cutting off his electronic tag.

He was supposed to attend the Old Bailey today for a hearing about previous alleged breaches of his TPIM.

However, after he failed to turn up - leaving his own lawyer in the lurch - Mr Justice Nicol issued an arrest warrant.

The judge also lifted an anonymity order banning reporting of the 20 charges Mohamed faced before he disappeared.

One indictment included six counts of breaching his TPIM by failing to report to Action police station on a number of occasions in December last year.

The other involved 14 charges dating back to 2011 when Mohamed was subject to a control order, the predecessor to TPIMs.

Among the charges, it is alleged he failed to report to a monitoring company, failed to report to Ipswich police station, met a person without agreement of the Home Office, and used an unauthorised mobile phone.

The defendant is alleged to have fought for al-Shabaab, the Somali wing of Al Qaeda.Mohamed's solicitor Gareth Peirce told the court she had 'no reason for the defendant's non-appearance'.

However, she suggested that he might somehow have been traumatised by being tortured in Somalia, allegedly with the collusion of the British security services.

'I say that because in relation to the breaches which are lateness of attendance at police stations his defence would have been that he suffered the effects and impact of torture,' Ms Peirce said.

Mohamed is due to stand trial for the alleged breaches of the terrorism prevention orders on April 28 next year.

Proceedings: Mohamed is currently suing the British Government over claims he was tortured in Somalia

Separately from the legal proceedings against him, he is seeking damages from the British Government over claims the UK was complicit in their detention and torture in 2011 while they were in Somaliland.

Their claim is against the Foreign Office, Home Office, Ministry of Defence and the Attorney General, who all deny the allegations.

The High Court heard today that the Government might seek to block the case as a result of Mohamed's fugitive status.

James Eadie QC said the case raised the question 'whether it is abusive for someone in Mr Mohamed's position to invoke the courts' jurisdiction as a claimant whilst denying that jurisdiction by absconding'.

Yesterday, fears were raised that Mohamed may have a second passport after confusion emerged over his British one.

Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs on Monday that officers had seized the 27-year-old's British passport, but then revealed that this was wrong.

Mohamed's British passport was cancelled before he returned to the UK, and he was placed on a 'warnings index'.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
