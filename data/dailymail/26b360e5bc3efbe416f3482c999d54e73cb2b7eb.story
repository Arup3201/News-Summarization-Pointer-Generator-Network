The horrific truth of the angora fur industry is revealed in these shocking images from a Chinese workshop.

The rabbits are tied up and stretched out before workers rip out the fur by hand, leaving the rabbits bleeding in their cages.

In a video recorded by PETA in China, where 90 per cent of the world's angora fur is sourced, the animals can be heard screaming in pain.

Factory horror: An angora rabbit is tied up and its skin stretched as it is being cut with an electric shear

The animals are kept for two to five years, with their fur being yanked out every two-three months, according to PETA Asia.

When the fur has been plucked, the animals are thrown into tiny cages to recover.

Once a bunny has outlived its purpose, it is killed and skinned.

‘PETA UK is appealing to shoppers this holiday season’, says PETA UK Associate Director Mimi Bekhechi.

‘Please take the time to read the label on that sweater or scarf. If it says "angora," leave the item on the rack.’

Pain and suffering: The terror in the animal's eyes is unmistakeable as a worker with a Chinese angora trader stretches it out and yanks out its fur

Animal cruelty: The angora rabbits are alive throughout the plucking and are kept for several years, plucked every few months, before their throats are slit

Torture: The Chinese fur traders use the plucking technique as it results in better quality fur and more money

Shocking truth: The animals are constantly injured from throughout the plucking as they struggle to break free

Left to recover: After the rabbit had had all its fur yanked out it is thrown into a cage to regrow its fur in complete solitude

Rabbits who have their fur cut or sheared also suffer: during the cutting process, their front and back legs are tightly tethered and the sharp cutting tools inevitably wound them as they struggle desperately to escape.

PETA reports that the traders keep the animals in solitary in barren wire cages that harm their sensitive feet.

They are denied solid flooring, bedding and the vital companionship of other rabbits.

In China, there are no penalties for animal abuse on rabbit farms and no standards that regulate the treatment of animals.

Locked up: The cages injure the rabbit's feet and the insanitary conditions see many of them, such as this one, suffer infections and illness

No hope: This young bunny is in the process of regrowing its fur while recovering from an eye infection in a naked steel cage
