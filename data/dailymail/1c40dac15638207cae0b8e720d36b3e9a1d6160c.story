When it comes to choosing what stories we like to click on when browsing news websites it seems we really are drawn in by tales of crime and scandal.

According to new research from the University of Bristol, people who read online news websites love to find out about the latest exploits of their favourite celebrities or read up on the latest fashions.

Yet they are not so enthusiastic when it comes to reading about politics or the economy.

Celebrity matters: Online news readers are more interested in finding out about famous people like the Duchess of Cambridge, left, and Kim Kardashian, right, than matters of politics or the economy

When the researchers from the University of Bristol looked at the most clicked news stories on the Australian site News.com.au they discovered that those containing the words 'woman', 'sex', 'girl', 'porn' and 'mum' were most popular. While stories containing the words 'nsw', 'australian', 'flood' and 'queensland' were least likely to be clicked on

The study by researchers from Bristol University's Intelligent Systems Laboratory looked at which stories 
were placed in the 'top stories' and 'most popular' feeds on a variety 
of news websites including the BBC and New York Times to find out what 
makes readers want to click on a story.

The research, led by Nello Cristianini, Professor of Artificial Intelligence, identified the most attractive keywords, as well as the least attractive ones, and explained the choices readers made.

When the researchers from the University of Bristol looked at the most clicked news stories on the Australian site News.com.au, for example, they discovered that those containing the words 'woman', 'sex', 'girl', 'porn' and 'mum' were most popular.

While stories containing the words 'nsw', 'australian', 'flood' and 'queensland' were least likely to be clicked on.

For Forbes readers, stories containing 'richest', 'app', 'best' and 'worst' were more likely to be clicked on.

Whereas stories containing the words 'share', 'stock' and 'dividend' were less popular.

The researchers found that using 'sentimentally charged language' and skewing towards entertainment and crime seemed to attract the most clicks.

The most popular words from the Forbes news website are shown in pink, with the least popular in black. Forbes readers clicked on more stories containing the words 'app', 'richest', 'worst' and 'best'. They were less interested in stories that contained the words 'stock' and 'share' and 'dividend'

The team examined 14 different sites 
over an 18-month period to build up a model of what readers of each 
publication prefer to read.

They looked at which stories were published on the home page and which were among the most read.

News
 articles were more appealing when the language used was more subjective
 - readers preferred tabloid articles to those of the BBC, the study 
found.

Articles that were about 'public 
affairs' and featured the word such as 'elections', 'the economy', 
'business' and 'politics' didn't perform as 'non-public affairs' 
articles.

These non-public affair stories typically covered topics such as disasters, crime, fashion and weather.

But according to Popsci, the study did
 not take into account other factors that might make a reader want to 
read a particular news story online.

Popular: Stories about dramatic weather seemed to grab the attention of readers according to the study

Turn off: But stories about politicians, such as Boris Johnson (pictured), and public affairs proved unpopular with online readers

Researchers didn't consider what photographs were used on the home pages and didn't compare demographics of the readers of different websites.

Professor Nello Cristianini, who led the team of researchers, said: 'We found significant inverse correlations between the appeal to users and the amount of attention devoted to public affairs.

'People are put off by public affairs and attracted by entertainment, crime, and other non-public affairs topics.'
