Jack Wilshere will see a specialist next week to determine the extent of the damage to his left ankle.

The Arsenal midfielder limped off with damaged  ligaments sustained in a tackle with Paddy McNair during Saturday's defeat by Manchester United.

Wenger has revealed Wilshere will be 'out for a while' but says the final prognosis will not be set until he sees a specialist.

'I cannot give you any time schedule there because he will be out for a while and he has to see a specialist next week to see how long he will be out. We don't know at the moment,' said Wenger at Tuesday afternoon's press conference.

'He has a big ankle sprain and I don't want to talk about it because I am not a specialist medically.

'The first news is they have told us that he will be out for the next few games. [To find out] for how long, we will need to see a specialist.' 

Meanwhile, Wenger has confirmed Laurent Koscielny will be included in the squad to face Dortmund.

The France defender has been out for two months with an achilles injury but is set to feature and Wenger believes his return will boost the Gunners' rearguard, which was brutally exposed by United on the break.

'He's in the squad for tomorrow. It's very good news because he was out for a while now and we are short in numbers defensively. It's good to have his quality back,' said Wenger.
