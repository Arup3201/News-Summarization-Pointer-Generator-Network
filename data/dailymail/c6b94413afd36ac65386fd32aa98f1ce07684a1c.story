A deputy headmaster was yesterday jailed for five years for secretly filming pupils using the school toilets and showers.

Gareth Williams, 47, installed tiny hidden spy cameras in clocks, fans and toilet cisterns in order to obtain pictures and videos of boys without their knowledge.

The married father of four even put a camera in the changing rooms on school sports day in order to catch as many children as possible.

Gareth Williams was jailed for five years for filming children in the toilets and showers of his school with secret spy cameras - but he is still being paid by education authorities, months after he pleaded guilty

Cardiff Crown Court heard that Gareth Williams installed secret cameras in the school toilet on sports day to catch as many children as possible

Cardiff Crown Court heard that Williams was appointed deputy headmaster at Glantaf High School in 2008, one year before the first indecent images were recorded

A court heard how Williams also 
installed cameras in two private homes, as well as the large mixed 
school where he worked, for his sexual gratification.

He was investigated by police after computer specialists found he had been buying illegal images of children  on the internet.

Officers
 who searched his home found two laptops and 11 memory sticks  along 
with the pinhole camera gear  and software he had installed with the aim
 of browsing the  internet undetected.

Williams,
 from Cardiff, was deputy head of Glantaf Welsh-language high school in 
the city, where former pupils include Hornblower actor Ioan Gruffudd and
 former Blue Peter presenter Gethin Jones.

The court heard a total of 31 boys at the 1,300-strong school aged between 11 and 16 were caught on Williams’s cameras.

Cardiff Crown Court heard he had 16,419 indecent images of children and 691 videos.

The court heard some of the images dated back to 2009 – a year after he was appointed deputy head at the school.

The court heard that Williams had 16,419 indecent images of children and 691 videos at his home in Cardiff

Prosecutor
 Michael Jones said of the images relating to the voyeurism charges: 
‘All these images were of children exposed as they were using the 
lavatory or the showers.

‘They
 had also been uploaded to a computer and catalogued by their age at the
 time the children were filmed. Officers discovered images of young 
males and the school’s badge could be seen.

‘They had been filmed in the changing facilities in the  school sports hall.’

Williams,
 who concealed one camera as a meter on the water cistern, even filmed 
himself on some of the videos as he secretly installed his devices.

Mr
 Jones explained: ‘On one of the videos he is seen crossing his fingers 
as he put it up. It showed he is hoping the camera is capturing the best
 possible images.’

Mr Jones
 continued: ‘This was a serious systematic abuse of trust. A devious and
 determined invasion of privacy of the children. The effect on children,
 staff and parents was one of complete and utter disbelief.’

Williams
 pleaded guilty to 31 charges of voyeurism and the making and possession
 of more than 16,000 indecent images of children. The voyeurism charge 
states Williams recorded other persons  for the purpose of sexual 
gratification.

Williams had 
also been coach of an under-15 rugby team and helped out with a scout 
group, while his duties at the school where he worked included  
‘pastoral care’.

In police interviews Williams said he had been looking at child images for ten years ‘to understand physical development’.

He also admitted an ‘enduring interest in boys’ development’ but couldn’t explain why. He admitted it had become an obsession.

After
 he was sentenced, his wife Georgina said in a statement: ‘I feel 
physically sick at what he has done to me and my family. I was 
shell-shocked and my whole world came crashing down.’

A judge sentenced Williams to five years at Cardiff Crown Court (pictured), describing his actions as 'depraved'

Judge Rhys Rowlands told Williams: ‘This is a dreadful and protracted breach of trust on  your behalf.

‘As
 a result of your depraved behaviour you have lost your career, 
livelihood and reputation. But this is nothing compared to the worry and
 real horror which is felt by parents who have trusted their children to
 you.’

The judge also ordered Williams to sign the sex offenders’  register, banning him from working with children.

He said: ‘I cannot conceive that you will ever be able to return to your previous occupation.’

The governors at the school said they had been ‘dismayed’ by the revelations.

In
 a joint statement with Cardiff Council they said: ‘The sense of 
betrayal and disappointment among the pupils, staff and wider school 
community is profound. This has been a very distressing episode for all 
concerned.’

Catrin Davies, 
from the Crown Prosecution Service Wales, said: ‘The offences committed 
by Gareth Williams constituted a gross breach of the trust placed in him
 by those close to him, his community, his pupils and  his employers.’
