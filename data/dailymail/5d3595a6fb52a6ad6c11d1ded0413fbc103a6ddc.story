British doctors have discovered two genes that affect how well statins work

Two key genes that affect how well cholesterol-busting statins work have been identified by British doctors.

The find paves the way for a life-saving blood test that helps ensure people’s cholesterol is kept under control.

The simple and inexpensive test could also be used to identify those at risk of side-effects to statins – so they can be prescribed something else. And help doctors target individual patients with the most effective statins for their case.

Statins, which lower levels of artery-clogging cholesterol, are the most widely-prescribed drugs in Britain and are taken by up to eight million people.

They are credited with saving thousands of lives a year, but side-effects from blurred vision and fatigue to muscle and liver damage can deter people from taking them.

Plus, the drugs simply work better in some patients than others.

Working with scientists from around the world, researchers from Queen Mary, University of London, have now shed light on why this is.

By analysing the DNA of more than 40,000 people taking statins, they found two genes linked to how much the drugs lowered cholesterol.

One of the genes makes it harder for statins to get into the liver, where they lower cholesterol.

This makes the drugs less effective.

The second gene, however, makes statins work extra-well, the journal Nature Communications reports.

Lead researcher, Professor Mark Caulfield, now wants to discover if the genes affect a person’s risk of heart attacks and strokes.

This extra research could lead to people being given a blood test before being prescribed statins.

If their genes show they will respond poorly to the drugs, they could be given a higher dose, a particular statin, or a different cholesterol-lowering medicine all together.

Keeping a lid on cholesterol could prevent deadly heart attacks and strokes – and reduce the number of people living with disability caused by them.

It is hoped the test would also spot those at risk of muscle wasting, a rare but potentially dangerous side-effect of statins.

It is hoped the discovery will pave the way for a new simple blood test to identify those people who will benefit from statins, and help doctors find the best course of treatment for each individual. File picture

The test could cost as little as £5 a person – and take just a year to develop.

However, studies would have to show it would save the NHS money overall if it was to become routinely used.

Co-author, Dr Michael Barnes, said: ‘Statins are one of the safest and most effective drugs in clinical use.

‘Some statins are more effective than others in different individuals.

‘This study highlights…genes that may individually or collectively influence the way statins act in the body.

‘In future, this information could help us select the most effective statin for each patient.'
