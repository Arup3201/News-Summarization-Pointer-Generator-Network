A man who released a record more than 20 years ago and now works in a bar has become an overnight sensation thanks to an army of line-dancing fans.

Ethan Allen, 41, from Aughton, Lancashire, released Somethin' In The Water with his band  Cheap Seats back in 1996, a track from their album, Call It What You Will.

However, now, thanks to its new following, it is now number 20 in the Country Music Chart 

Ethan Allen, 41 of Lancashire, has become a sensation from his song that was released in 1996

The song has long been a staple at line-dancing events but when a video of the performance taken at the 19th Crystal Boot Awards in Blackpool in February and posted to Ethan Allen's Facebook page, it went wild.

Mr Allen, who works as music director at Eric's on Liverpool's Mathew Street, was busy at work when he heard the news.

'I was doing the stock take of the bar when I got a text that said one of my songs from 20 years ago had three million hits online in the last week,' he said.

'I thought it was a wind up, but I looked and there it was. Every day we get hundreds of thousands more so it's already topped 4 million,' he told the Mirror.

In only three days, the clip had 3,602,445 views and is growing at around 100,000 a day, with shares from hundreds of thousands of line-dance fans and US Country Radio Stations 99.1 WQIL Jacksonville and 93.1 The Wolf Greensboro.

Ethan worked in Nashville when he was younger and completed a tour of the States after being signed at just 19 years old.

But things didn't work out, Ethan was dropped from his label and when he was dropped, he returned to Liverpool and started playing in bars and clubs, reports the Liverpool Echo.

'I had a residency in New Brighton and I met John Pettifer. We set up the Cheap Seats and paid for ourselves to go over and make a record. It went mad,' he says.

The group won CMT International Video Artist of The Year in 1996 and 1997, BCMA Rising Star and Best Group in 1997 and the video for 'Somethin' In The Water was Number One in the CMT Video Chart in 1996.

With the current success of Country and new bands such as The Shires and Ward Thomas play-listed it looks like The Cheap Seats were indeed 20 years ahead of their time.

Ethan said: 'I've been amazed by the phenomenal response to this and it is great to be back in the public eye after such a long time. It would be great to do a re-union tour to mark 20 years of The Cheap Seats.'

Somethin’ In The Water was released through Mondo Recordings on Monday and is available on iTunes.

Ethan Allen's album Call It What You Will is released on Mondo Recordings on April 6.
