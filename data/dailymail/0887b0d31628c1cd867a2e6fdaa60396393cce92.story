Anne Frank's diary has been brought to life in a multimillion pound theatrical production.

Simply titled 'Anne', the show transports viewers back to the Amsterdam apartment where Anne and her family hid from the Nazis during the Second World War.

Set in a specially-built theatre on the outskirts of the town, viewers are able to watch the moment the Frank family are arrested and dragged away by German security police - as well as the moments leading up to that fateful moment.

Anne Frank's diary is being brought to life in a multimillion pound theatrical production in Amsterdam. Pictured are two actors portraying Anne and her mother Edith in the innovative show

Simply titled Anne, the show uses film projected on to a giant panoramic screen to help tell the tale of the Frank family who hid in an Amsterdam apartment from the Nazis

It is hoped a series of interactive sets used in the show - including one of the Frank's apartment that revolves across a panoramic screen - will help bring the young diarist's story to a new generation.

The show marks the first time a theatrical production has been forged directly from Frank's actual writings since an award-winning 1950s play that escalated her tale, which was little known at the time, to the world's attention.

Producer Robin de Levita said in an interview prior to its opening last month: 'A lot of people think they know the story, but once you see this you will get to know a lot of details you don't realize.

'We show historical footage to create a relationship between what happened in real time and what happened while they were in hiding.

'We follow her whole life and look over her shoulder, see what she experienced.'

With the blessings of the charity that owns the diary's copyright, Anne uses Frank's own words, including some passages excluded from the original published diary.

Some of the sets revolve around a large panoramic screen, pictured here showing a film of the German dictator. Extracts from Anne's diary will be used in the show - with actors speaking in Dutch

The play is being staged in a specially-built 1,100-seat theater in Amsterdam's west port area.

The 15-meter-high (50-foot) stage includes a revolving replica of the secret canal-side apartment where Frank and her family hid for 18 months from the Nazi forces occupying the Netherlands in World War II. They were betrayed in 1944 and deported.

'You can see the relationship between the rooms, between the people, what actually happened while they were in hiding.' De Levita said.

Anne died at the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp weeks before it was liberated in 1945.

Her father, Otto Frank, survived Auschwitz and later published Anne's diary, which had been saved by Miep Gies, one of the Dutch 'helpers' that brought the family food and other supplies.

Anne's cousin Buddy Elias, her nearest surviving relative, will attend the opening, along with the Netherlands' King Willem Alexander.

Although the actors speak Dutch, starting in July there will be headphone translations into several major languages, along with a synopsis for computer tablets or smartphones.

The Anne Frank Fonds in Basel, Switzerland, which owns rights to the diary and oversees the Frank family legacy, said it sought out theater-makers and scriptwriters in the Netherlands, hoping a new theatrical production could promote its mission.

'It's important to have an educational program which will bring in today's times the story of Anne Frank to a young kind of audience,' said Fonds spokesman Yves Kugelmann.

The Dutch script was written by one of the Netherlands' best-known literary couples, Leon de Winter and Jessica Durlacher.

Tickets range from 20-70 euros (£16-£55) but the Fond's licensing fees go to UNICEF, the U.N. children's fund.
