In a preview of what could be a bloody 2016 presidential contest, Sen. Rand Paul claimed Wednesday that Hillary Clinton's 'shoot first' foreign policy – if it had succeeded – would have put the terrorist Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) in control of Syria.

Her aggressive advice to President Barack Obama about arming rebel groups there, the Kentucky Republican wrote in an online essay for The Wall Street Journal, represented ISIS's best chance to have a nation-state of its own.

'To interventionists like former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, we would caution that arming the Islamic rebels in Syria created a haven for the Islamic State,' he wrote. 

'We are lucky Mrs. Clinton didn't get her way and the Obama administration did not bring about regime change in Syria. That new regime might well be ISIS.'

Senator Rand Paul is emerging as the most dovish of likely Republican 2016 presidential hopefuls, arguing in favor of relative isolationism and slamming Democrats who favored arming rebel groups in the Middle East

Paul and Clinton are both likely 2016 presidential candidates.

If they should emerge as their parties' nominees, an unusual political dynamic would cast the Democrat as the war hawk and the Republican as a dovish isolationist.

The rise of ISIS in Syria and Iraq, Paul claimed, shows that Clinton and others who pushed in 2013 for the U.S. to arm militants opposed to dictator Bashar al-Assad last year lack 'a reasonable degree of foresight.' 

'Those who say we should have done more to arm the Syrian rebel groups have it backward,' he wrote. Mrs Clinton was also eager to shoot first in Syria before asking some important questions.'

The former secretary of state sees things differently. 

She told The Atlantic this month that it was the West's failure to help rebels topple Assad that created 'a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.'

The quick expansion and growth of ISIS has turned the Obama administration's strategy on its head. 

A year ago, the White House weighed the value of airstrikes against Assad as news emerged that his regime was deploying chemical weapons in cities controlled by rebel groups. 

Now it's considering attacks against ISIS – which is among Assad's biggest domestic headaches – in Syria. 

Paul seized on the confusion Wednesday to brand Clinton as its architect.

'Our Middle Eastern policy is unhinged,' he wrote, 'flailing about to see who to act against next, with little thought to the consequences. This is not a foreign policy.'

'The Islamic State represents a threat that should be taken seriously. But we should also recall how recent foreign-policy decisions have helped these extremists so that we don't make the same mistake of potentially aiding our enemies again.'

The Democratic National Committee responded Thursday, saying Paul was promoting 'reckless ideas' by urging U.S. 'retreat from the world.'

'Simply put, if Rand Paul had a foreign policy slogan, it would be – The Rand Paul Doctrine: Blame America. Retreat from the World,' DNC national press secretary Michael Czin said in a statement.
