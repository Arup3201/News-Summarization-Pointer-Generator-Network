A massive python has been caught on camera swallowing a baby antelope whole.

The impressive digestive feat was captured by Indian animal rescuer Nitish Bambhaniya in the tiny village of Billa in the Indian state of Gujarat.

The photographer and a member of his team dashed 25 miles to the scene on a motorcycle after getting a tip-off from a local in the area - arriving to find the giant snake devouring a nilgai, a type of Asian antelope also known as a blue bull.

Many locals wanted to kill the python, fearing that if let go, it would be a risk to children

Nitish, who runs the Red Headed Vulture Nature Club, said: 'I got a call in the morning for an Indian rock python.

'When we reached the spot. We saw this massive python. The python had hunted a baby blue bull and had already eaten 80 per cent of the bull's body.

'It was on the edge of an open field, so lots of locals started gathering there.'

Food for thought: The python didn't make a meal of the digestive feat, easily swallowing its huge prey

Jaw-dropping: The snake has almost finished its meal, as locals look on

Scared off: In the end the snake regurgitates the antelope as it feared being attacked by the locals

Many locals wanted to kill the python, fearing that if let go, it would be a risk to children in the neighbouring villages.

With the crowd gathering around the python, it stopped swallowing the antelope and let go of his prey.

'Pythons do it so that they can shed body weight and escape faster,' Nitish added.

'Meanwhile, we convinced the villagers not to kill the python and they agreed. Later we caught the python and handed it over to the forest department officials.'

The python was released by the officials in a nearby forest, before slithering away to freedom.
