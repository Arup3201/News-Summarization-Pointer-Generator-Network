Recruits to the armed forces will be asked whether they are gay and about their sexual preferences.

The measure has been introduced in a bid to foster greater tolerance within the armed forces, which only allowed gay soldiers to openly serve in 2000.

Recruits can, however, choose not to make the declaration. There are no records kept on the number of gay recruits in the force, but the year before the ban was lifted 298 were dismissed.

James Wharton, 28, who suffered beatings in the Household Cavalry’s Blues and Royals for being openly gay before being famously saved by Prince Harry, welcomed the move.

The ex-Lance Corporal told the Sunday Mirror: ‘It’s fantastic news. But its important troops don’t have to reveal sexual preferences. I wasn’t ready to do that.’

The MoD has previously been forced to make human rights pay outs to gay soldiers. In 2009 they paid just over £124,000 to lesbian soldier, Lance Bombardier Kerry Fletcher, for harassment she suffered which led to her quitting the Royal Artillery.

Recruits will also be asked to provide additional information on how open they feel they can be regarding their sexual orientation.

The information will not be visible on individual personal records or to chain of command or managers, and will be anonymised before being collated to ensure no one can be identified by their personal diversity information.

The Ministry of Defence believes the information will better help them understand the 'composition' of the armed forces and help them ensure their policies and practices 'fully support our personnel'; pictured above, recruits are put through an exercise at the Army Training Regiment near Winchester in 2007

A Ministry of Defence (MoD) spokesman said the ministry ‘encourages diversity at all levels’.

The spokesman said: ‘Service personnel are now encouraged to declare their sexual orientation. Although this is not mandatory, collecting this data will give us a better understanding of the composition of our armed forces and help ensure our policies and practices fully support our personnel.’

The move to encourage recruits to declare their sexual orientation was introduced last November.

The armed forces said they believe the policy will shed new light on their workforce and help create a more inclusive organisation where everyone feels values - no matter their sexuality, race, religion or gender.

Stonewall, a charity which campaigned against the discrimination of gay soldiers, welcomed the move saying the more the MoD knows about personnel, the more they ‘can support’ them.
