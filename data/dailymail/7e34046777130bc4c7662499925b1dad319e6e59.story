The parents of six-year-old pageant queen Honey Boo Boo have been accused of child abuse, according to a new report.

Alana Thompson, aka Honey Boo Boo of Toddlers & Tiaras fame, and her family, who live in rural McIntrye, Georgia, were visited by the Georgia Division of Family and Children Services in March, reported The National Enquirer.

A source told the magazine that authorities who made the unannounced visit 'found reason to bring the case to court' but a 'court-appointed attorney' for June Thompson, the youngster's mother, convinced the judge to 'throw it [the case] out'.

The source said investigators were called to the home as a result of June and Mike Thompson's unorthodox, and highly-publicised, parenting methods which include feeding Alana caffeinated drinks as well as roadkill for dinner.

Finding fame: She now stars in the spin-off show Here Comes Honey Boo Boo along with her family

The family now star in their own spin-off reality series, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, which has also showed Alana go mud belly flop diving, adopt a pet pig named Glitzy, attend local food auctions with June and help her buy more than a dozen packets of chocolate milk powder, during one supermarket visit, using discount coupons.

The source added: 'Honey Boo Boo's upbringing raised eyebrows with neighbours.'

The initial visit by authorities is said to have occurred 'shortly after filming began' on the new TLC series which premiered on August 8. It attracted 2.2million viewers.

Although June sparked outrage back in January when she was seen on Toddlers & Tiaras feeding Alana 'Go Go Juice', a mixture of Mountain Dew and Red Bull, the authorities visited the family after catching wind of an online video that showed Alana dancing for dollars in a bar.

The video, which can still be found on YouTube, was not filmed by the network however showed Alana in a darkened room, dancing atop of table as coloured lights flash around her.

June defended her daughter's actions by explaining that Alana had been dancing in a college bar, not a sleazy one.

The 'Go Go Juice' incident, which saw Alana being fed the liquid after having downed 15 bags of Pixy Stix, tubes of powdered sugar commonly referred to as 'pageant crack', attracted negative criticism of its own.

June was filmed instructing Alana to take 'two big gulps' from an 
unlabelled bottle.

Within seconds, the change was apparent and the 
pageant hopeful was seen rapidly swinging her arms over her head and 
spinning around on the floor, exclaiming: 'My Go Go juice is kicking in 
right now!'

Beauty pageant insiders speculate that some mothers' 'special juice' blends may even contain alcohol.

Describing how 
the drink made her feel, Alana said: 'Go Go juice makes me laughy, and 
play-ey, and makes me feel like I want to pull my mommy's hair.'

June has stolen much of the limelight away from her daughter in the new reality series.

During its debut episode, she was seen grinding up against a young man as her daughter played in a giant mud pit.

She has also been filmed taking her family to the supermarket to help her shop using discount coupons and take Alana to their local food auction, June's favourite weekly activity, in order to bid on what appeared to be sugary donuts.

She has also admitted that she is obsessed with 'couponing', labeling it 'better than sex' in a teaser for tonight's new episode of the reality series.

The coupon queen, as she is commonly referred to, continued: 'Couponing is a serious obsession. Anybody who uses coupons will tell you that it is an addiction.'
