John Simpson has confessed that he took part in a tax avoidance scheme until a crisis of conscience caused him to change his mind.

The BBC’s world affairs editor, 67, revealed that he had placed his London townhouse in the trust of a Bahamas-based company overseen by his South African wife Dee Kruger.

The plan was to avoid inheritance tax or stamp duty in the event of a future sale of the Chelsea property, which he bought for £1.85million back in 2004, and the offshore scheme was entirely within the law.

Avoider: John Simpson, pictured with his wife Dee, said his £1.85million London home 
was placed in an off-shore company until he decided to end the legal 
arrangement recently

But Simpson, who has reported from 30 
war-torn countries in a career spanning more than 40 years, said he 
recently came to the conclusion that paying tax is one of the ‘duties of
a citizen of this country’.

He said he had come to his decision before 
the recent tax avoidance controversy involving Jimmy Carr and Gary 
Barlow became public.

Simpson said he had decided to put his
house back under his and his wife’s names – even though doing so could 
land him with a six-figure capital gains tax bill in addition to 
liability for inheritance tax and stamp duty if he sells the house.

Duty: John Simpson, the BBC's World Affairs editor, said it was 'absolutely right' for a citizen of Britain to pay tax to the government of the day - even though it's painful - but he said it was part of a citizen's 'duties'

Simpson told the Independent: ‘It’s 
absolutely right for a citizen of this country to pay whatever amount of
tax, within reason, the Government of the day feels is required. It’s 
painful but I think that’s part of the duties of a citizen of this 
country’.

Shamed: Comedian Carr was publically 
vilified after it was revealed that he was keeping his £3.3 million 
fortune in a completely legal tax scheme in Jersey

Last month, stand-up comedian Carr 
issued an apology for his ‘terrible error of judgment’ after it was 
revealed that he kept his £3.3million fortune in a legal tax avoidance 
scheme in Jersey which saw him pay as little as 1 per cent tax on his 
earnings.

More than 1,000 people, including Take
That star Barlow, are thought to be using the same K2 scheme, which 
could be hiding around £168million a year from the Treasury.

Simpson also hit out at the BBC for 
sidelining David Dimbleby during last month’s Diamond Jubilee coverage 
in favour of younger faces, saying: ‘This has not been a good time in 
the BBC for people who say, “Let’s just have young people”.

‘As a viewer, as well as a performer, I
just missed David Dimbleby so much. I do find it a bit odd that we’ve 
got this state-of-the-art Rolls-Royce that for some reason we don’t 
always bring out for these occasions.’

It comes a week after Simpson said he 
would consider euthanasia in old age rather than be reduced to a 
‘gibbering wreck’ who is reliant on a carer to manage basic functions.

Simpson married his second wife, Miss 
Kruger – who is 19 years his junior – in 1996. She gave birth to their 
six-year-old son Rafe in 2006.

The journalist also has two daughters from his first marriage.
