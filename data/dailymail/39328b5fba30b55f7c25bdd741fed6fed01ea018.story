Defying mummy: Toddler Mabel loves running around without her sun hat (posed by model)

We're in Cornwall on holiday for a week and for the first time in a million years of 'staycationing' here, the weather is actually on our side.

Tagging along is a friend who doesn’t have children but has foolishly agreed to come with us.

Our family routine baffles her. Why, she asks me on day three, does it take two adults and four children several hours to leave the holiday house?

I have no answer. Whole species could crawl out of the sea, evolve and then become extinct in the time it takes for us to pack for the beach.

I don't understand the delay because I start the exit countdown while everyone is still in their PJs. I even turn off the telly. No one moves except the toddler who inexplicably asks: 'What is Michael Buble?'

While I cram everything into a bag, Mr Candy finds the buckets and spades. My friend packs her book.

'You won’t need that,' I say. 'No one with children under ten takes a book to the beach.'

The toddler is the only child who has started to get ready. She's naked and running round shouting 'Bitch! Bitch!' No matter how many times we correct her she still can't say 'beach'.

'Get dressed NOW,' I instruct the other three who are still lying on the sofa. My friend is standing by the door reading her book.

Finally, when we are all ready, Mr Candy decides to disappear to the loo.

'We leave without him,' I command, the captain abandoning one of the troops.

Outside the toddler is lying star-shaped, face-down and howling. She can't find her purple shoe.

'We can’t leave without her though, can we?' my friend asks, confused by family etiquette and looking at her watch.

'Nope,' I reply before instructing the eldest to get the two-year-old's shoe out of the pan cupboard where she hides things.

Experts say three is the best age to start teaching children to swim - any younger and they struggle to take instructions

At last we all leave. It's midday by now, and we're on the way to the seaside in blazing sun. Mabel removes her hat three times before we leave the garden. I lumber up the path after her struggling with my enormous bag, like a Blackpool donkey saddled with an overweight tourist.

By this point the tide has come in and gone out. I'm dripping with sweat and about as patient as Gordon Ramsay.

'Put that hat back on now, Mabel,' I plead through gritted teeth. She refuses four times. Finally I say: 'Put it on now or a crocodile will come and eat you.'

The six-year-old looks behind him nervously and my friend looks shocked.

'I bet that's not in the Gina Ford book on parenting,' she mutters. 'No,' I concede. 'But if you can find me a mum who has never used a similar threat in extremis, you can have the first shower when we get back before the kids use up all the hot water.'

There's a pause. 'I haven’t slept properly for ten years,' I say to no one in particular. 'Something's got to give.'

I notice Gracie-in-the-middle is wearing her home-made T-shirt. On the front it says: 'It's what's on the inside that matters.' On the back she's written: 'I'm a monster on the inside.'

Despite the heat, my son has dressed himself in thick jogging bottoms and a long-sleeved shirt. He's also wearing socks. My eldest is in a wetsuit, as she refuses to apply sun tan lotion. We look like an oddly-dressed circus act on our way to a festival.

This is when I realise the reason I'm not one of those mums who can post hundreds of beautiful family pictures on Facebook is because I've recklessly encouraged free will among my offspring!

The neighbours sunbathing in their garden try not to stare at my noisy, motley crew.

Their two children are top to toe in Mini-Boden, sitting on the lawn in their sunhats - a perfect Facebook family.

Mabel throws her hat in the air as high as she can.

'Now the crocodile is coming to eat you,' she yells defiantly, then runs off giggling wildly.

And we all collapse with laughter. We might be late, but we're happy.

Why does it take them hours to leave the house for the beach?
