Four Chinese fishermen who were searching for crabs in a river have accidentally discovered what is believed to be a WWII bomber.

The men were trauling through the Yangtze River in Zhanghu County, Anqing, eastern China's Anhui Province, when they came across the wreckage.

It took two days to salvage the plane which is thought to be a B-25 bomber from the 'Flying Tigers' squadron, a special unit of US pilots tasked with training Chinese forces in air combat.

A US scholar has suggested the bomber could belong to the 'Flying Tigers' squadron which protected China from Japanese forces during the war

The plane's undercarriage, engine and fuselage were recovered from the river, still bearing a North American Aviation engraving.

The aircraft's plate is inscribed with a serial number and date of manufacture, indicating it was built in February 1943.

However, this would suggest the bomber was in fact not part of the squadron which ceased operations in China in 1942, a year earlier.

It is possible the plane belonged to the Chinese American Composite Wing which flew operations throughout the country until the end of the war.

Also known as the first American Volunteer Group of Chinese Forces, the 'Flying Tigers' were made up by members of the United States Army, Navy and Marine Corps.

The aircraft still bears a 'North American Aviation' inscription as well as a date of manufacture of 1943

The B-25 bomber is one of the most distinctive among all individual fighter aircraft

The group consisted of three fighter squadron which each contained around 20 aircraft.

Having trained in Burma before American entry into the Second World War, it was the squadrons' duty to protect Chinese forces from Japanese attack.

Their bombers are among some of the most recognisable of any individual combat aircraft, with distinctive shark-faced noses.

Unlike the 'Flying Tigers' who were recruited under presidential authority, The Chinese-American Composite Wing was a joint organisation between the United States Army Air Forces and the Republic of China Air Force.

Jointly commanded by both American and Chinese officers, the unit remained operational until 1943.
