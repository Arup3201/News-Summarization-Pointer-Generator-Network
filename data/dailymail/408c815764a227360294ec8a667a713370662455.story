Like millions of schoolchildren, MPs couldn’t wait to start their six week summer holiday.

But without the chance to watch a DVD or play Buckaroo on the green benches of the House of Commons hardly any politicians bothered turning up for the last day of the parliamentary term.

Maybe MPs can be forgiven for needing a break – it has been a whole month since the last time the Commons had a recess.

Early finish: At 4.19pm yesterday afternoon the green benches of the House of Commons were almost empty as MPs dashed off for their summer recess

At 5.20pm yesterday Commons John Bercow moved to adjourn the House of Commons until September 2.

It means there will be no new legislation, no debates and no Prime Minister’s Questions for six long weeks.

MPs argue they will spend the summer working in their constituencies.

With
 the general election now less than two years away, those with the 
smallest majorities would be sensible to use the time to win over more 
voters.

However the chance to get away early proved too great for most.

David Cameron lead the way after being spotted in the crowds watching the cricket at Lord's.

10.02am: On the last day of term yesterday just a few dozen MPs turned up in the Commons to grill Business Secretary Vince Cable

1.37pm: By lunchtime they were struggling to get into double figures on the green benches

5pm: With most people still hard at work in the country, just three MPs could be seen in the Commons chamber before it packed up for the summer

The Prime Minister donned sunglasses to make sure he did not miss any of the action during the second Ashes test.

The visit to the cricket is just the 
start of a long summer for Mr Cameron, who has previously been accused 
of spending too long chillaxing.

He is expected to return to Cornwall 
for a holiday this summer, while reports also suggest he will take a 
break in Scotland – in the middle of his campaign against independence.

Mr Clegg will be away at the same time, leaving William Hague and Theresa May in charge of the country.

The
 PM and his deputy are to leave the country on holiday at the same time 
this summer – despite having six weeks to ensure one of them stays in 
charge of the country.

As the Commons wound down yesterday it seemed most MPs have started their break early.

Fewer than 50 of the 650 MPs turned out to see Business Secretary Vince Cable answer questions on the economy at 9.30am.

By 1.30pm the numbers had dwindled to a couple of dozen for a debate on an EU-US Trade and Investment Agreement.

As the clock ticked on to 4pm the number of MPs left for a general debate was struggling to get into double figures.

And just three were left when Tory MP Bill Cash had a debate on HM Revenue and Customs.

In 2012-13 the Commons sat just 145 times, the second lowest figure since 1945 for a year where there was not a general election. Some in Westminster predict it could be even lower this year.

Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Any MP worth their salt will be busy in their constituency during the summer recess.

‘However, the long break means that ministers will get away without being scrutinised in Parliament for six whole weeks by the people we elect to hold them to account.

‘Week in, week out, we see debates on important legislation being curtailed as a result of strict timetable motions, which means Bills are getting passed by MPs without having been subject to detailed scrutiny.

‘This is bad for democracy and reducing the length of the recesses would make more time available for the Commons to properly debate new laws and hold the Government to account.’

Since January, MPs have only had a full five-day week in Westminster eight times.

They usually spend Monday to Thursday in Parliament and then have Friday as a ‘constituency day’ to attend local events and meet voters.

The Commons had a week off in February for half term. It then broke up for 19 days, returning once when Parliament was recalled for tributes to Baroness Thatcher.

The Commons then sat for just eight days before breaking again on April 25, this time for prorogation to prepare for the Queen’s Speech on May 8.

It meant a bonus 12 days off, before returning for the pomp and ceremony of the State Opening of Parliament.

Despite setting out more than a dozen major bills, including legislation on reforming social care and pensions, there appears to be no urgency to start debating the laws.

They then broke up for a week-long recess at the end of May and had another week off at the end of June.

Earlier this year Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs Westminster’s spending watchdog, warned the public think politicians are lazy and provide poor value for money.

'We are living through the worst economic crisis in modern times. MPs have a lot to do and yet we are spending much of our time in recess,’ she said.

'Members of the public would be forgiven for thinking that it is MPs who are lazy and that it is Parliament that is failing to provide good value for money.

'We are not spending enough time in Westminster, and this creates a democratic vacuum.'
