A judge has warned of the dangers of informal surrogacy agreements after a woman found she had no parental rights to the baby she had asked her friend to conceive with her husband.

The ‘do it yourself’-style surrogate pregnancy ended in the High Court after the boy, now three, was effectively left with two mothers.

Unable to have children of her own, a woman asked a close friend to be artificially inseminated at home with her husband’s sperm.

But when the woman’s marriage broke 
down months after the birth of the child, she found she had no parental 
rights because she was not the boy’s legal or biological mother.

Yesterday,
 she was granted a residency order to care for the child, but the judge 
warned against anyone considering an informal surrogacy agreement, 
rather than through a professional agency.

Describing
 the case as a ‘cautionary tale’, Mrs Justice Eleanor King underlined 
the ‘real dangers’ of private surrogacy agreements and urged couples to 
use licensed and regulated fertility clinics.

Even
 then, surrogacy contracts are not enforceable and a gestational mother 
can always change her mind about handing the child to the couple.

The father and surrogate mother were named on the toddler’s birth certificate and, in the eyes of the law, they are his parents.

The
 judge said medics had spotted something was amiss when the surrogate 
mother booked herself in at the Leicester Royal Infirmary to give birth.

Doctors insisted on seeing a formal surrogacy agreement and the couple went to a firm of solicitors, who drafted an agreement.

Mrs
 Justice King said the solicitors unwittingly committed a crime when 
they drafted it, because they charged for the preparation of the 
agreement, which is in breach of the Surrogacy Arrangements Act 1985.

The
 couple’s relationship broke down soon after the birth and they have 
since divorced. The court heard they made a second legal error when they
 failed to seek court recognition of the woman’s parenthood within six 
months of the birth.

The judge said the time limit was mandatory and making a parental order in the woman’s favour was ‘not an option’.

Allowing her to formally adopt the child was also not an option and the woman was left with no legal rights over the boy.

The
 judge said social workers and lawyers had worked hard to find a 
solution. After several years of ‘bitter recriminations’ the couple set 
aside their grievances and put in place practical shared care 
arrangements, the court heard.

While
 the woman could never become the boy’s legal mother, Mrs Justice King 
said steps could be taken to ‘provide her with security and recognition 
of her status’.

The surrogate mother, who remains a close family friend, technically has parental responsibility for the boy.

But
 the judge directed that he should remain a ward of court indefinitely 
and made a shared residence order in favour of the former couple, 
effectively granting the woman parental responsibility for the child.

The surrogate mother was banned from exercising her parental rights without permission from the court.
