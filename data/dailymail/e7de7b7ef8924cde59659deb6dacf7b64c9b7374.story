Appropriate dress: The UAE prefers people in public to cover up, including shoulders and knees

Advice cards ordering shoppers to cover up at a Dubai shopping mall have been branded 'unfair' and 'humiliating' by tourists and ex-pats.

In the latest crackdown on those who flout the United Arab Emirates' strict dress code, security guards at Dubai Marina Mall, have been handing out the cards to men and women who are deemed to be dressed inappropriately.

The blue cards tell customers to wear 'respectful clothing' that covers the shoulders and knees at all times. The cards also explain what is considered acceptable clothing, and what is not.

Although signs asking shoppers to follow the dress code have been put up at the mall's entrances, staff say they are either not being read, or people are deliberately ignoring them.

One employee, who asked not to be named, said: 'We put up a lot of posters, but everyone ignores them, This is the only way to tell people directly.'

According to The National, 'dozens of women' at the mall yesterday were breaching the rules by showing off their shoulders and knees.

Although Laura Gates, from the UK, was wearing a dress which exposed her shoulders, she had not been handed a card.

She said: 'I don’t think I’m breaking any rules. I’m not wearing beachwear, that’s why no one has said anything.'

An Australian shopper, who asked only to be named as Christiana, said she thought the rule unfairly targeted women.

She added: 'I see men walking around in shorts all the time, but women can’t do the same. That doesn’t seem fair.'

Reminder: Dubai has strict policies when it comes to dress, and baring shoulders and knees is inappropriate

Lucia di Domenico, from the US, believed it would be humiliating to be told directly that they were inappropriately dressed.

She said: 'I would be very embarrassed if they said that. I don’t think I’d want to come back to the mall if they treat people like that.'

Another employee at the mall, who declined to be named, said the rule was applied only for the most flagrant breaches.

They said: 'We only give it to those people who are dressed totally unacceptably. This is Dubai’s rules, not just the rules of the mall.'

Emaar, which operates Dubai Marina 
Mall and the Dubai Mall, declined to comment. But the issue of 
inappropriate clothing remains a key talking point.

Last
 year Emiratis Asma Al Muhairi and Hanan Al Rayes launched Twitter page 
@UAEDressCode, which regularly posts on issues of modest dress in public
 places, and now has 4,600 followers.

Cultural adviser and columnist for The National, Ali Al Saloom, said the problem was due to a lack of clarity over what constituted 'disrespectful' dress.

He said: 'It’s always a grey area on how to judge it, on what’s okay and what’s not okay.

'We keep hoping that people would kindly understand that when you’re revealing a lot of skin, like a short skirt or showing your shoulder or chest, this would definitely be considered not modest.

'This goes for everyone, including men.'

Mr Al Saloom insisted the Marina Mall initiative was 'just an extra reminder, on top of all the other many reminders', and claimed that tougher rules needed to be introduced.

He added: 'Everything can be solved easily if the mall didn’t let people inappropriately dressed people enter in the first place.'
