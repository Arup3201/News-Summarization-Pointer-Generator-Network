A hero teacher, who put himself in front of the 12-year-old Roswell school shooter and bravely convinced the child to drop his weapon, has spoken out about the 'harrowing experience'.

Brave John Masterson, a social studies teacher at Berrendo Middle School, convinced the shooter, today identified as 12-year-old Mason Campbell, to put down the .20-gauge, sawed off shotgun and give himself up after his shooting rampage left two of his classmates fighting for their lives.

The 7th grader walked into a packed gymnasium at the beginning of the school day on Tuesday and opened fire at his classmates, leaving an 11-year-old boy fighting for his life and a 13-year-old girl, named as Kendal Sanders, in serious condition.

After the first shots rang out, Masterson was quick to react, throwing 
himself towards the armed youngster and convincing him to lay his 
shotgun on the ground.

'Mr. Masterson ... was a hero ...who stood there and allowed a gun to be pointed right at him,'Â New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez said at a vigil Tuesday evening, according to CNN, 'and to talk down that young boy to drop the gun so that there would be no more young kids hurt.'

Mr Masterson has been a teacher for ten years and also coaches soccer at the school.

He told the Albuquerque Journal he was warned not to speak at length about the shooting but spoke of his horror.

'It was a harrowing experience. All I can say was the staff there did a great job,' he said.

The
 two victims were first taken to Eastern New Mexico Medical Center and 
then airlifted to the University of Medical Center in Lubbock, Texas, 
where the unidentified 11-year-old boy reportedly told nurses he was the target of the 
shocking 
spray of bullets.

A teacher also suffered minor injuries but refused medical aid so he could stay on to assist at the scene.

Kendal Sanders was initially classed as critical after being shot in the arm but has improved so she is classified as in a serious condition today.

Roswell police announced soon after the shooting that the suspect had been arrested at the campus and was in custody.

At the press conference, New Mexico state police chief Pete N. Kassetas said the drama unfolded at the school around 7:30 a.m.

'(The suspect) walked into the gymnasium. We believe the weapon was concealed in a bag and it wasn't known about until right before he started shooting,' he said.

Witnesses said the 11-year-old victim was shot in the face, though officials refused to confirm this.

Kassetas said the school's principal recognized a NM state police lieutenant who was dropping off his own child as she locked the door and asked for his help. However, when he arrived inside the gym, the weapon was already on the ground.

He went on to applaud the bravery of school officials.

'It is one thing for a police officer whose job this is to intervene but for a teacher or staff member to intervene, I commend the principal and the teachers and people at this school for saving many more lives,' he said.

Kassetas said detectives were conducting interviews with over 100 students and faculty as part of the investigation but they were confident the 12-year-old was acting alone.

He didn't know a motive at this stage and said officers had been in touch with the parents of the suspected shooter and both victims.

Superintendent Burris insisted security at his schools was not to blame and said the incident came as a total shock to all.

'We come to school daily thinking we are going to educate our kids and lead them but we never think things like today will ever happen,' he said. 'And they do.'

Roswell Mayor Jere Wood told reporters he was devastated by the news and called for an end to such senseless acts of violence.

'We were saddened when we heard of the shooting we were saddened for the victims and their injuries and the hurt it has brought to the community of Roswell,' he said, offering up any resources the ISD required for things like counseling.

Earlier, Gabriel Tortillo, a 7th grade student at Berrendo, told the Albuquerque Journal he saw a male student carrying a gun. He said that student shot a boy in the eye area.

Sixth grade student Anyssa Vegara said she was talking to a security guard when she heard the shot.

'I turned around and all I saw was someone on the floor with their arm bleeding,' the student said.

Shooter: No information about the shooter or the type of weapon used has been released

She said the security guard ran to help the injured student, and school officials ordered all the students to their classrooms.

It was earlier reported that there were 
at least four victims, but the injured kids appeared to have been counted twice.

Roswell PD posted word of the shooting on its Facebook page not long after 8 a.m. local time.

The
 school was placed on lockdown and children were transported in buses from the school 
to a nearby mall where their terrified parents came to collect them.

Eventually, Anyssa was able to text her mother, Monica Vegara.

'From the time hearing about it, until the time she texted, it was a nightmare,' the panicked mother told the Journal.

'... this incident is being 
investigated. There are many resources and law enforcement officers on 
scene securing the area,' he added.

Roswell City Councilor Savino Sanchez said he found out about the shooting after receiving a phone call.

He said once news of the shooting spread
 throughout town, residents began to worry. 'I know a lot of people are 
concerned,' he said.

Roswell has been rocked by gang violence in recent years and has asked Homeland Security Investigations to step in and help.

The city has a population of about 50,000. It a center for ranching and farming and is home to the New Mexico Military Institute, the only state-supported military college in the West. The city is perhaps best known as the site of an alleged UFO crash in 1947.

A prayer vigil was held Tuesday evening.

Governor Martinez added: 'Please don't forget this community is a strong community. There is no doubt they will pull together.'
