One team is headed for the World Cup finals, the other for the beach. But the gulf between the Republic of Ireland and Portugal is wider than the Atlantic Ocean they have crossed for their friendly in the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Tuesday morning.

Portugal are ranked fourth in the world, with Ireland provisionally ranked 70 places lower — a gap in class that Martin O’Neill’s makeshift crew will struggle to bridge.

It wasn’t always like this but the rivalry of the 2002 World Cup qualifiers, which saw two draws, and the friendly win for Ireland in 2005, seems a distant haze now.

Opposition: Republic of Ireland manager Martin O'Neill hopes Portugal provide a challenge

Player-wise, Portugal have  Ronaldo as their poster boy while Ireland have Robbie Keane, a Ronaldo fan to the extent he voted for him as FIFA World Player of the Year.

Everyone thinks highly of Ronaldo, who will figure after overcoming injury, and even Roy Keane holds his former Manchester United colleague in high esteem as ‘a player and person’, according to O’Neill.

In a city of stars, few are burning brighter than Ronaldo, who is the chief reason 50,000 fans are  converging on East Rutherford (7.45pm local time). They expect to see the gaily bedecked Portuguese galleons scuttle the hand-crafted Irish currachs in a froth of goals.

And even O’Neill, by instinct an optimist, is aware of the challenge confronting his under-strength side. ‘I would imagine this probably would be our toughest game of these four,’ he said.

‘Obviously, Portugal in their last game before the World Cup — I don’t know what way they will approach it and whether they would risk Ronaldo in the game — but for us, it’s still a big test.

‘I would just like to finish on a high if we can and to get a really good performance, something akin to the Italian performance, and to try to finish the off-season on a decent note.’

Anticipation: Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to return to the Portugal line-up for the game

O’Neill is eager that Ronaldo plays, which may be courting trouble.

‘He is one of the top two players in the world. He’s just a brilliant, brilliant player,’ he added. ‘We had a few problems the other night (against Costa Rica) at the beginning of the second half of the game for about 15 or 20 minutes when (Joel) Campbell came out wide and caused us a few problems, so you could imagine Ronaldo being in that sort of form.

‘It should be great for us to want to go and play against him. I think the players want him to be playing in the game so they can go and test themselves. I think a game like this benefits the younger players to be around the senior lads and encourages them not to be fearful when it comes to the big matches.’

Technical ability: Wes Hoolahan could be recalled from the bench and his passing style could trouble Portugal

O’Neill, who will attend Portugal’s opening World Cup Group G game against Germany next Monday, could do with a positive result as one win in six games has seen the Irish ranking plummet.

‘We just keep dropping down, don’t we?’ he said, before adding a light touch. ‘I told you, we’re going to choose some new countries at home to play in the middle of our season, and their off-season, and we’ll try and force a 1-0 win.

‘It’ll raise us up those rankings, to give us a chance in the 2028 World Cup, you know.’

O’Neill was guarded about his selection yesterday but his back five will consist entirely of  Championship players, which would be a worry. Wes Hoolahan is expected to return after being on the bench against Costa Rica and his svelte passing game, may unhinge the Portuguese defence.

Unconcerned: O'Neill made light of Ireland's dramatic drop in the FIFA rankings to 70th place

O’Neill didn’t regard it as  coincidence that Hoolahan didn’t start the two games where Ireland lacked a creative sparkle, against Poland and Costa Rica.

‘I don’t think that is the case, I don’t look at it like that. When I get back home and really analyse things, then there might be a  pattern. But I have not looked that deeply into it.’

Robbie Keane is eager to play and put his penalty aberration against Costa Rica behind him.

‘It’s gone. That’s the way it goes. I’m not one to dwell on things,’ said Keane. ‘You want to score. When you don’t you feel you let people down but you’ ve got to get on with it. After the game it was forgotten. If he goes the other way, is it a good  penalty? Listen, he saved it, that’s the way it goes.’

Would he take one tomorrow if on the field? ‘Of course,’ he said.

Uncharacteristic: Robbie Keane is not overly upset by his penalty miss for Ireland against Costa Rica

O’Neill has a concern over the  fitness of Shane Long who has a back problem and took it easy in training yesterday where a lightweight squad was joined by Ryan Meara, the 23-year-old reserve  goalkeeper for New York Red Bulls, who is eligible for the Republic through his Irish grandfather.

‘It was the first time I saw him live and I’d need to see a bit more of him, obviously,’ said O’Neill. 

‘Seamus (McDonagh) has put a couple of DVDs in front of my nose which I haven’t had a chance to look at properly.

‘It would be very hard to make an assessment today on a 15-minute each-way game. But I’ll definitely keep an eye on him,’ he added.

The courting of Meara highlights the shortage of top class keepers and puts the position of David Forde in focus, especially after a slightly uncertain contribution against Costa Rica.

Forde has thrived on the big occasions, such as against Italy 10 days ago when he was busy early on.

He may be busier for a lot longer against Portugal.

Under threat: David Forde's place in the Ireland goal is by no means assured after some shaky displays
