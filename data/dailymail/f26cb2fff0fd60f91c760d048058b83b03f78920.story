When Geraldine Rowing was told by doctors she needed a liver transplant she feared she would face a long wait for a donor organ.

At an appointment with her doctor she mentioned in passing that she was a non-identical twin.

It was a long shot, but he suggested her sister, Annemarie Atha, be tested to see if she was a match.

The results shocked the sisters - despite not looking the same and their mother telling them they were non-identical - the pair were in fact genetically identical.

They have now become the first identical twins to undergo a live liver transplant in the UK.

When Geraldine Rowing, left, was put on the transplant list she feared she would have to wait for a donor organ. But her non-identical twin Annemarie Atha, right, was prepared to be tested to see if she was a match

The results revealed the sisters, who had always believed they were non-identical because they don't look the same, were in fact, genetically identical. Annemarie, left, donated part of her liver to her sister in the first live liver transplant between identical twins, carried out in the UK

Ms Atha, 48, said she did not think twice about donating part of her liver to her twin, when she became ill.

She said it was an added bonus to discover, despite everything they had been told, that they were genetically identical.

It meant Ms Rowing does not need to take a cocktail of drugs to stop her body rejecting the new organ.  

'I would just like to say thank you very much Annemarie,' Ms Rowing said as she hugged her sister at St James's Hospital, in Leeds, where the operation took place.

'Thank you from the bottom of my heart.' 

Ms Rowing's liver had been damaged by cancer a few years ago, prompting doctors to recommend she was added to the transplant list.

She told her doctor she was a non-identical twin and he suggested doing tests.

The results revealed the sisters, who live in Rothwell, near Leeds, were genetically identical despite not looking exactly the same.  

'Mum always said that because there were two placentas when we were born, we weren't identical,' said Ms Atha.

'So we've grown up believing we're not identical because Geraldine's got a wider smile than me and she's got a squarer face than me. 

Geraldine, second left, and Annemarie, second right, are pictured with consultant liver surgeons Raj Prasad, left and Ernest Hidalgo, who performed the operation at Leeds' St James University Hospital 

'We've both got the silly same nose and I'm a teeny, teeny bit taller than Geraldine. So mum always said "you're not identical".

'But they said you're identical enough to do the transplant.'

The sisters went through the operation in April and Ms Rowing said she is feeling much better.

'I'm feeling better by the day,' she said.

'It was a while ago and I still get tired but I can't thank everybody enough.

'I walk round and nobody knows that I've had a liver transplant.' 

Ms Atha said: 'It's nice to have Geraldine back to normal again.'

Consultant liver surgeon Raj Prasad, who did the operation, said live liver transplants - where the donor is a living person who donates a section of their organ for the operation - are getting more common.

He said St James's did their first one in 2007 and will do around 20 this year - around one in seven of all liver transplants.

Mr Prasad said the main problem was putting the donor - an otherwise healthy person - through a major and potentially life-threatening operation.

But he said it meant the ill person did not have to wait for an organ to become available from a dead donor.

He added the benefits of identical twins having the operation was massive.

He said it was even more so in the case of Ms Rowing as taking immuno-suppressant drugs would increase her risk of further cancer.

Mr Prasad said: 'It's an absolutely massive advantage which is God or nature's gift. It's a dream.'

Genetics expert, Dr Anand Saggar, a senior consultant in clinical genetics at St George's in London said Ms Rowing and Ms Atha's case is 'surprising but not unheard of'.

He said non-identical twins are formed from two eggs, which are fertilised by two different sperm. 

'Effectively they are siblings that just happen to be born in one womb at the same time,' Dr Saggar told MailOnline.

'They are two completely different siblings born separately.'

In the case of identical twins, one egg is fertilised by one sperm, creating an embryo that splits in two in the womb.

The fact Annemarie and Geraldine were found to be genetically identical meant Geraldine didn't have to take anti-rejection drugs as her body accepted the new organ as if it was her own

Dr Saggar said the twins' mother's justification that they had two placentas does not mean they were non-identical.

If the embryo divides early on in the pregnancy, each baby will be grow within its own placenta.

The later the split happens, the more likely it is identical twins will grow in one, single placenta. 

'The fact they had two placentas means the split happened early on. The later the embryo divides the less likely it is there will be two placentas,' Dr Saggar said.

Once an embryo has split to create twins, there are a number of factors that will determine how each baby will look later in life.

Dr Saggar told MailOnline: 'People naively perhaps, believe identical twins should be absolutely identical because they have the same genes.

'But that assumes that every element that controls us is dictated by a coding sequence.

'You have to view the coding sequence and the human body as  a complicated orchestra of genes.

'The way a piece of music is played can alter the sound you get.

'Let's take a piece by Mozart, two different orchestras will play the same piece differently.

'There are different things that influence the expression of the same genes.

Genetics expert, Dr Anand Saggar, a senior consultant in clinical genetics at St George's in London said Ms Rowing and Ms Atha's case is 'surprising but not unheard of'. He said many aspects will affect how identical twins look, and once an embryo has divided it is possible different gene mutations affect differing siblings

'Epigenetics is the big thing everyone is talking about at the moment. The coating, layering or shielding on genes which can express now or later.

'And then there are spontaneous mutations that occur.

'Of course where a single embryo splits in two a spontaneous mutation could occur in just one half of the divide.

'If the mutation happens before the embryo splits, it will depend on which half the mutation ends up as to which baby will be affected by it.

'Yes, of course we should expect twins to have similar hair colour and facial features.

'But there are also other issues that can affect visual appearance.

'Nutrition influences growth, the risk of cardiovascular disease, so why not how big a person's nose is.

'Different placentas will mean different levels of nutrition.

'There is also sometimes a situation known as blood stealing from one placenta to another which can alter things including growth rates.

'Yes, this is a surprising case but it is not unheard of.'
