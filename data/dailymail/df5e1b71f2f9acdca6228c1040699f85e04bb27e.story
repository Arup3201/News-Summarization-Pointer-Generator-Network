Ben Evans has had surgery after rupturing his hamstring against St Helens

Warrington's Wales international Ben Evans is set to spend around four months recuperating from a ruptured hamstring.

The 22-year-old prop suffered the horrific injury during the Wolves' 32-24 defeat by Super League leaders St Helens last Thursday.

He spent the weekend in London, where he underwent surgery, before returning to Warrington on Sunday night.

'It was a particularly nasty injury and he was in a considerable amount of discomfort at the time,' Warrington assistant coach Richard Agar said.

'But they got him off to hospital as soon as they possibly could and got him down to London the next day to see the specialist.

'He's had a fairly extensive operation to re-attach it but it's going to be a long injury. The first estimates are around four months but all that will depend on the success of the operation and how he rehabs.

'If it goes well for him, he will have a chance of playing again this year and at this place he is going to get the best medical care.'

The Wales international (centre) will be sidelined, alongside brother Rhys, for around four months

Evans will have the company of his twin brother Rhys, the Warrington winger, during his recovery period.

Rhys underwent shoulder surgery after damaging it during the Wolves' World Club Series clash with St George Illawarra in February and is facing a similar length of time on the sidelines.

'It's sad for Ben because he's got an opportunity that he had been patiently waiting for,' added Agar. 'Both him and Rhys have now picked up sizeable injuries and will be out for a similar length of time.'
