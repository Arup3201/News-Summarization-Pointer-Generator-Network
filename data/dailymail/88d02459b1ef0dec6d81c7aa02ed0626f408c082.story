It's no surprise that Olympic heroes the Brownlee brothers have been announced in the England squad for this summer's Commonwealth Games.

The Yorkshire-born and bred brothers will be going for gold in the triathlon - with their main competition one another.

But while they are both keen to add Commonwealth champion to their list of achievements, they are also hoping their sportsmanship can encourage others to get active.

Fun competition: The Brownlee brothers recommend families hold their own Commonwealth Games in their gardens this summer

Jonny, 24, told MailOnline: 'I remember getting up early to watch the 
Sydney Olympics in 2000 and that really inspired me. I got up about 1am so I 
could watch the triathlon live and it made me really want to get out 
there and train.

'The Commonwealth Games is a massive opportunity for us
 to inspire kids in the same way. There was a massive take up in sport 
after the London Olympics and hopefully we'll see the same thing happen 
this summer. It's so important that we capitalise on the current 
climate of excitement ahead of the Games to inspire kids 
to be more active.'

Alistair, 26, who was originally hoping to compete in the 10k race in the Glasgow games as well as the triathlon (before injury intervened), agreed.

But he added that it's not just children they want to encourage to get fit but their parents too.

They teamed up with Warburtons to suggest fun activities families can do over the summer including creating their own Commonwealth Games in their gardens, by staging relay races and long jump competitions between siblings and their friends.

Being competitive is important - the brother's sibling rivalry has certainly never done them any harm - but they point out it really is the taking part that counts.

Alistair said: 'We like to do as much as we can to help people to get fit and this is one way to do that and encourage 
people to be outside.'

Alistair added it's important for parents to get involved, pointing out that along with his sporting heroes growing up like Paula Radcliffe, it was the adults in his life - his parents, teachers and coaches - who inspired him to become an Olympian. In turn, he inspired younger brother Jonny to strive to be the best.

Research by Warburtons found that the 2012 Olympics had a positive effect on more than 50 per cent of children in the UK, inspiring them to work harder at school, join a sports club and spend more time outside.

High profile sporting events this summer, including the World Cup, which kicked off last week, and July's Commonwealth Games, are set to continue the trend and inspire a third of children and over a quarter of parents to be more active this summer.

The Brownlees said they would love it if they could inspire more people to take up triathlon, which has only been an official part of the Commonwealth Games since 2002.

Alistair said they have definitely noticed an uptake in the sport, which involves swimming, cycling and running, since the London Olympics in which he took the gold and his brother the bronze.

He said: 'Everyone knows what it 
is now and many people will know someone who has done one. A lot more 
people follow it more so there has been a massive change.'

The brothers have responded to the demand by setting up their own triathlon races called Brownlee Tri. The first race was held in West Sussex yesterday and will be followed by an event in Leeds in September. The races are open to all abilities with 'super-sprint (400m open-water swim, 16km cycle, 2.5km run and 'sprint' (750m open-water swim, 29.5km cycle, 5km run) races on offer.

The brothers said their own family inspired them to keep fit

The brothers are also in the process of setting up their own charity - the Brownlee Foundation - which will offer free triathlons to children in partnership with schools to encourage participation in the sport from a young age.

But while the brothers are keen to inspire others to be triathletes, Jonny joked that he hoped it doesn't lead to a protege stealling their thunder in the near future.

He said: I would be pleased in a way but hopefully it will be a few years before the people we inspired start beating us!'
