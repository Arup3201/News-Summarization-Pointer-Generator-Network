The mother of the 16-year-old boy accused of killing his half-brother and burying him in the family’s Menifee, California yard has spoken publicly for the first time to say she’s standing behind her son.

Shawna Smith isn’t saying whether whether or not Skylor Atilano killed her younger son Terry Smith Jr., 11, only that the jailed teen is frightened and she intends to be there for him.

‘I love him and I'm going to stand behind him no matter what,’ said Smith, who is now without all three of her children after her daughter was placed in protective services in the wake of the murder accusations.

'I love him': As she stood in front of the Menifee, California home where her 11-year-old son was found murdered and buried, Shawna Smith spoke publicly, defending her son for for the first time

Troubled: A judge noted that Skylor has a history of violent outbursts and that he had violated the terms of his probation. He's now accused of killing his half-brother Terry Jr., right

Up until now, Shawna had lived in the 
Riverside County, California town of Menifee with all three of the kids 
and finally opened up to a KNBC reporter who approached her front gate 
Wednesday.

Now the children are gone.

‘It doesn't make 
my life easier,’ she said. ‘It makes it 20 times harder. ... My kids 
were my life. They still are. I love all three of them.’

Terry’s
remains were discovered buried in a shallow grave in the backyard of 
Terry’s home July 10 after Orange County psychic medium Pam Ragland 
isolated the location of the body.

Charged: Skylor Atilano, 16, attends his first court appearance after being charged in the murder of his 11-year-old brother. 'He's scared,' said mom Shawna Smith

'No conclusions': Smith wouldn't say whether or not her son murdered his half-brother

Memorial: A shrine was set up for Terry Smith Jr, 11, who was found dead with the help of a psychic medium July 10, buried in his own yard

Accompanied
by an off-duty firefighter, Ragland drove out to the Menifee home. 
After making the horrific discovery, the firefighter called 911 to 
report that they had found Terry.

'OK,
we believe we may have found a human head,' the man could be heard 
telling a dispatcher on the call. 'We're out searching for a little boy,
Terry Smith,' the local station KESQ reported.

Meanwhile, Shawna Smith denied any connection to the crime in the brief interview with the Los Angeles NBC affiliate.

Doubts: Terry Jr.'s father believes something fishy is going on and that Shawna Smith knows more than she's letting on

‘I was cleared by the police,’ she said. ‘Polygraphed -- came back clean. I had nothing to do with this.’

About
1,000 volunteers had spent four days scouring an area of more than 50 
square miles in Southern California looking for Smith Jr, who 
disappeared July 7.

Atilano has since been charged with the boy's murder.

On Wednesday, Smith said her surviving son has her full support, though she stopped short of defending his innocence.

‘I’m
not making any assumptions,’ she said while she stood in front of the 
desert home where her other son was found murdered. ’I'm not going to 
say he's innocent, but I'm not going to say he's guilty, either. I love 
him.’

Waiting game: A judge will determine in September whether the teenager, pictured in this courtroom sketch, would be tried as a juvenile or as an adult

During his first 
hearing at the Southwest Justice Center in Murrieta, Atilano's detention
hearing was postponed until September 17, at which time a judge will 
determine whether the teenager would be tried as a juvenile or as an 
adult.

Judge Timothy Freer said that Skylor had a 'history of violent outbursts' and that he had violated the terms of his probation. He would not elaborate on the nature of the teen's previous run-in with the law.

Atilano was ordered to remain in jail ahead of his next court appearance. 

It is expected that the positive identification of the body found in the backyard of the Manifee residence will take anywhere from two to six weeks using DNA evidence, according to the Riverside County Coroner's Bureau. 

Vision: Pam Ragland was volunteering during the search for the missing boy and had a 'knowing' of where she should go to look for the body

Near home: The boys lived with their mother and her partner in the home center right, and Terry's body was found in a shallow grave by the tree back to the left, only 100 feet away

The psychic's revelation came the same day that the boy's father, who lives in West 
Virginia, said that Terry was not autistic and that he had spoken to him
before he disappeared when the boy asked him if he could go visit.

The
11-year-old had lived with his father, Terry Smith Sr., in West 
Virginia up until 2001 when he went to live with his mother Shawna in 
California. Shawna now lives in Menifee with her longterm lesbian 
partner, Denise, alng with Skylor and the daughter now removed from the home by authorities.

Reeling: Denise (pictured), Terry's mother's longterm lesbian partner, said that the family is grieving

Heartbroken: The boy's father, Terry Smith Sr (pictured), is a retired truck driver who lives in West Virginia and he said that- in spite of Shawna's claims- he did not believe his son was autistic

Shawna initially described Terry Jr. as an autistic boy who took special medication and answered only to his nickname, 'JuJu.'

His father, however, insisted that his son was not autistic, saying he was a normal kid who loved video games and baseball, he said.

'He was a very bright, well-adjusted child, at least he was when he left here,' said Smith Sr., a 62-year-old retired truck driver.

'He pushed buttons and would aggravate you. But, other than that, it was just the typical way... of a typical boy trying to get his way.'

Smith Sr. also helped raise the half brother accused in the case, even though he was not his biological father, he said.

The teen moved from West Virginia to California after his mother abruptly pulled him out of school, he said.

'I
taught him how to walk. I helped him when he was on the baseball team 
here,' he said, recalling that he called the half brother 'little 
Spider-Man.'

'Him and (the half brother) got into it and it went too far,' said Smith Sr.

Tragic: The psychic said that she knew she was close when she smelled 'something dead'

In danger: Terry is pictured here, in photos sent out during the massive manhunt that ended with a psychic finding his dead body July 10
