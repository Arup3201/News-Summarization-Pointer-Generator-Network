Spanish newspaper AS has made it clear who it sees as the favourite for the Ballon d'Or award with a headline that read 'Cristiano Ronaldo and 22 more', after the 23 nominees for the prestigious award were announced on Tuesday.

The Real Madrid forward has made a blistering start to the season, with 21 club goals in 14 games, and earlier this year he inspired Los Blancos to a Champions League and Copa del Rey double. 

Ronaldo is the current holder of the award and he will hope to lift the trophy ahead of Barcelona's Lionel Messi who was given the accolade every year between 2010 and 2012.
