Men and women risked broken bones on Friday in a race to see who can strut the best in stilettos.

Up to 100 runners from the Marikina suburb of Manila in the Philippines competed in the whacky annual race, Tour of Heels.

Competitors scrambled along a 500 metre track in heels at least three inches high in an unusual test of balance and endurance.

The race takes place to celebrate the shoe festival in Marikina, which is known as the shoe capital of the country.

Men and women were kept separate during the event to prevent any injuries as they raced to the finish line.

Runner Karel Blances admitted: 'It is difficult having to tiptoe and I salute those women who wear high heels. It definitely hurts to wear them.'

Competitors wore a range of flamboyant outfits to match their stilettos in a bid to win the 'shoe-perstar award' for the most glamorous runner.

One woman even wore her bridal dress to claim the sought-after award for most glamorous runner

Glendolly Sumait wore her bridal dress to try to claim the award and finish first. But she was let down by the bulkiness of her dress.

She said: 'It is easier to run with rubber shoes because you can easily run fast, instead of wearing heels where you need to look sexy while running.'

Cash prizes were awarded to the quickest and best dressed runners of the race.

Gerald De Asis, who fended off competition to be crowned the winner of the men's division, said the secret to his success was willpower and technique.

He said: 'You have to balance yourself so you won't trip and don't think about what you're wearing. Just keep running.'Â 

Medics were on hand to tend to any injuries as competitors tripped and heels snapped
