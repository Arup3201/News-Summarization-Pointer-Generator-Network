Hint: Mayor of London Boris Johnson, pictured today at the opening of Kings Cross Square, has said he wants to return to the Commons

Boris Johnson has hinted that he wants to return to Westminster, amid growing rumours that a Tory MP will be forced out to make way for him.

The London Mayor revealed that watching the Commons debate on Syria, which led to a humiliating defeat for his party leader David Cameron, made him pine for the chamber’s green benches.

In an interview Mr Johnson said: ‘For the first time in years I wished I was in Parliament.’

Mr Johnson has pledged to serve out his second term as mayor, which concludes in 2016. He previously served as Tory MP for Henley-on-Thames from 2001 to 2008.

There is nothing to prevent someone holding the mayoralty and a parliamentary seat at the same time; Mr Johnson’s predecessor Ken Livingstone did so for a year.

But allies last night admitted that he has ‘not decided’ whether to run for Parliament again in 2015, allowing him to be in place for a potential Tory leadership election if Mr Cameron were to lose the General Election.

‘He just doesn’t know yet,’ said one source. ‘The only time he’s thought about it recently was over Syria.

‘He’s loving being mayor and he’ll do that until 2016.’ Mr Johnson made the comments in an interview with the Financial Times.

His plans are expected to seize the headlines next Monday when he  travels to the Tory Party conference in Manchester for a rally with grassroots supporters.

Aides say he will make a ‘highly political’ speech on Tuesday denouncing UKIP and the Labour Party.

But his opposition to the High Speed 2 rail line, backed by Mr Cameron, and his support for the immediate building of a new hub airport will put him publicly at odds with the Prime Minister.

Rumours that Mr Johnson’s return to Westminster could be imminent were fuelled yesterday when it was confirmed that the executive of the Conservative association in the safe Tory seat of Reigate has refused to confirm the sitting MP Crispin Blunt as the candidate for the next election.

Mr Blunt, a former prisons minister, offended senior figures in his local party in 2010 when he announced that he had separated from his wife so that he can ‘come to terms with his homosexuality’.

Local reports suggest that Reigate officials would like to replace Mr Blunt with Mr Johnson, but the Mayor’s aides deny that he has been in talks. ‘Boris hasn’t been approached. He hasn’t had any talks with them,’ a source said.

Mr Blunt will now have to face a full vote of his constituency party to see if he can survive.

If Mr Johnson does decide to return to Parliament he will not be short of offers from Tory associations.

The Conservatives announced yesterday that they will hold an open primary in Tonbridge and Malling, the Kent seat where veteran Sir John Stanley is standing down.

Other MPs are said to be prepared to quit close to the election in 2015 to pave the way for Mr Johnson’s return.

Make way: It is thought that many other MPs are willing to step aside to allow Boris to return to the Commons
