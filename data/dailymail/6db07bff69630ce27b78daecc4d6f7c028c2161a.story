The new Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, said criminal defendants could be allowed to take part in court hearings from home using Skype and FaceTime

Internet video calling software such as Skype and FaceTime could allow criminal defendants to appear in court from home, the country’s most senior judge has said. 

Lord Chief Justice Lord Thomas said the use of video links in hearings held before Crown Court trials would slash the cost of bringing to court prisoners, defendants on bail and their lawyers.

But critics said criminals should not be allowed to appear ‘from the comfort of their living room’, while others said video links would demean the ‘dignity’ of the court.

Lord Thomas, who took over as head of the judiciary in England and Wales last month, said internet video calls would be cheaper than the dedicated closed circuit TV systems which are often installed in court buildings because they are supposed to protect security.

‘There are innovative ways of providing open justice bearing in mind things such as Skype and FaceTime,’ said Lord Thomas in his first annual press conference since taking up his post.

‘We need to loosen up our use of Skype and FaceTime, which current IT systems don’t really allow.

'I am very keen that we should because with most of what happens in court you don’t have problems with security, and we can be much more open to use of Skype and FaceTime than we traditionally have been.’

Lord Thomas suggested lawyers, prisoners and defendants released on bail could all communicate with the court using the technology

He said he had singled out Skype and 
Apple’s FaceTime on the basis of cost and said internet video programs 
could not be used during full-scale criminal trials but at the pre-trial
 hearings at which judges and lawyers prepare the ground for the trial.

‘A lot of the difficulties we have are that to make a court case work well you need a pre-trial hearing,’ he said.

‘But it is often very expensive to 
get a prisoner or a person who is out on bail to come to court, to get 
the lawyers to come to court and I think a lot of this can be solved by 
the use of technology.’

However, Sadiq Khan MP, Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary, said: ‘I am shocked by this suggestion.

'Defendants appearing via Skype from 
the comfort of their own living room for their trial is taking justice 
on the cheap to a new low.

Lord Thomas also revealed guidelines on dealing with face-veils in courtrooms would go out to public consultation. Prime Minister David Cameron (left) and minister Kenneth Clarke (right) have both spoken out against women being allowed to wear veils while giving evidence in court

‘It’s ridiculous that defendants 
should be given the option of avoiding their day in the dock while 
witnesses, including the victim, have made the effort to go to court.  

‘Being charged with a criminal offence is a serious matter and should be treated as such by the defendant.’

Tracey Crouch, the Tory MP for Chatham and Aylesford, said: ‘This is lazy justice. It saves on time, trouble and money.

'There are innovative ways of 
actually providing open justice bearing in mind things such as Skype and
 FaceTime. We need to loosen up our use of Skype and FaceTime, which 
current IT systems don’t really allow'

'But it diminishes the dignity of the legal system and I am worried about it.’

But James Clappison, a barrister and the Tory MP for Hertsmere, said: ‘Pre-trial hearings are often a formality.

'They are held to work out how long 
the trial will last and who is required as a witness. It seems to me a 
sensible area to look for ways to save money.’

Criminologist Dr David Green, of the 
Civitas think tank, said: ‘At the moment, the process is expensive and 
consumes a lot of time before the trial gets going. It is possible there
 could be savings without any danger to justice.

‘It may be that Skype may lead to a 
better use of the time of judges and lawyers, and less risk of prisoners
 escaping when they are moved about to go to court.’

Lord Thomas also revealed that a 
decision over guidance to be given to judges on whether women should be 
allowed to wear the veil in court would shortly be made the subject of a
 public consultation.
