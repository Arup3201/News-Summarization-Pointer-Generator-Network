Russian leader Vladimir Putin has been accused of betraying dozens of children hoping for a new life in the West after signing a new law blocking all adoptions by American families.

From January 1 it will be illegal to take a baby from Russia to the US under the law signed by president Putin today.

The move will have an immediate effect on as many as 52 children in Russia who were preparing for adoption - many of whom suffer disabilities or live in bleak orphanages according to charities.

The Fillmore family from Utah adopted Hazel, a 
four-year-old Russian girl with Down's syndrome on Christmas Eve, making them among the last American parents to be permitted to do so.

The Fillmore's welcomed 
little Hazel into their home after fighting for almost a
year to adopt her. They are among dozens of American families calling on President Putin to reconsider for the health of the children involved.

The Kremlin human rights council said a total of 52 children were on the brink of being adopted and had been told they are getting a new home in America.

'We now have three children in the process of adoption, two of them are handicapped - one with Down's Syndrome aged five and one with HIV aged four,' said an official at just one agency.

'These children are no longer so small, they understand that future parents are coming for them, they are waiting for them and the families have already visited them.

Siblings: Hazel, 4, pictured right with one of her new siblings, is settling in well to her new home in American Fork, Utah. Critics say many other Russian children have been denied a similar future due to Mr Putin's decision

'For us this decision is painful. We are working with live people. It is a shock.'

'The adoptive parents are not guilty 
of anything and the orphans themselves have of course done nothing 
wrong,' said Mikhail Fedotov, head of the Kremlin human rights council.

President Putin's move is seen as revenge for a new American law banning visas for Russian 
officials implicated in the 2009 prison death of the whistle-blowing 
lawyer Sergei Magnitsky.

Several Russian politicians - including respected foreign minister Sergei Lavrov - spoke out against the new crackdown which was rushed through parliament in a matter of days to slap down the Americans.

Ban: Russian President Vladimir Putin, pictured, has signed a bill banning Americans from adopting Russian children that has raised tensions between Moscow and Washington

President Putin ignored protests, accusing the US of 'acting brazenly and arrogantly' towards Russia.

He said the 'outflow' of children for foreign adoption posed a threat to Russia's future.

'We may reach a certain point at 
which - once we overstep it - we will not be able to stop our ruin,' he 
warned. So we have to be extremely sensitive and attentive toward such 
things.'

US families adopted nearly 1,000 
Russian children last year but, from January 1, such moves will be 
illegal. The ban maybe extended soon to all foreign countries, including 
Britain.

The
US is the biggest destination for adopted Russian children - more than 
60,000 of them have been taken in by Americans over the past two 
decades.

The 
US State Department says it regrets the Russian Parliament's decision 
to pass the bill, saying it would prevent many children from growing up 
in families.

Amnesty International Europe and 
Central Asia director John Dalhuisen said: 'This bill is frankly a 
childish response to the Magnitsky Act.

'The Duma should be focusing its efforts on how it can strengthen Russian civil society, not weaken it.' Kremlin children's tsar Pavel Astakhov said that Russian families would now adopt the children.

However, they earlier declined to do 
so - which is why the youngsters are available for foreign adoption. 
Commentator Yuliya Latynina dubbed the move 'worse than a crime.'

'The man responsible for this mistake is none other than President Vladimir Putin,' she said. 'According to various estimates, 50 
to 95 percent of children who grow up in Russian orphanages become drug 
addicts or alcoholics or commit suicide.

Deep concerns: The U.S. State Department said it had 'deep concerns' about the welfare of more than 700,000 Russian children in orphanages, particularly those with disabilities like Hazel, pictured

'Russian orphanages essentially 
produce children who suffer from Mowgli Syndrome - that is, they are 
ill-equipped to function in any capacity in society.'

Among those condemning the new law 
was Paralympic record breaking medal winner Jessica Long, 20, who was 
adopted by US parents from Siberia.

'I love my family here in America, 
thanks to them I am what I am and I achieved what I achieved. I learned 
to swim and now I've got bright future ahead of me,' she said. 'To 
prohibit adoption means to deprive these children of their bright 
future. It is so sad.

'They have done nothing bad, these 
children. They are just children. So why prohibit adoption if it would 
have given them a hope to have things they never had?'

A Moscow court today also acquitted 
the former deputy chief of a Moscow prison where Magnitsky was held over
causing his death by negligence.

Success: Jessica Long, pictured, was given up shortly after birth by her parents in Siberia but was raised by adoptive parents in the United States and became a Paralympic swimming champion

Winner: Long, pictured, won a gold medal for the women's 100m freestyle S8 swimming final at the London 2012 Paralympic Games

Dmitry Kratov was the only Russian 
official to still be facing charges over the Magnitsky case. Mr 
Magnitsky exposed an alleged £125 million corruption racket among senior
Russian officials and paid with his life, say his supporters.

The legislation was dubbed by the 
pro-Kremlin press as the Dima Yakovlev law, referring to a Russian boy 
adopted in the United States who died after being locked in a hot car by
his adoptive US father in 2008.

Preempting criticism of the move, Putin promised measures to better care for his country's orphans.

'I
intend to sign also a presidential decree that will modify the support 
mechanisms for orphaned children ... especially those who are in a 
difficult situation, by that I mean in poor health,' he said.

It took about 11 months for the Fillmores to bring Hazel home from Russia. She arrived at Salt Lake City International Airport at 11pm on Christmas Eve.

'It's been tough, but worth it, and to have her here and be part of our family, it's now great,' Jeremy Fillmore told the Deseret News. 'We feel like we're complete and we're excited to have her.'

They
found Hazel through a website that advocates for children with special 
needs called Reece’s Rainbow Down Syndrome Adoption Ministry. According 
to the newspaper, she was the second girl they adopted from Russia with 
the help of the website. Anya, who is now 7 years old, was adopted in 
March 2011.

The banning of American adoptions plays on sensitivity in Russia about adoptions by foreigners, which skyrocketed as the social safety net unraveled with the 1991 Soviet collapse. Families from the United States adopt more Russian children than those of any other country.
