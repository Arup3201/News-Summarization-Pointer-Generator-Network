Rio Ferdinand's every move is being shadowed by Danny Simpson, says former Marseille midfielder Joey Barton.

Barton tweeted a picture of Ferdinand and Simpson in the changing rooms accompanied by the words: 'He doesn't want toweling down mate. Give him a yard lad #riosshadow.'

Danny Simpson spent four years at Manchester United between 2006-10, and it would seem the former Newcastle man is more than slightly pleased they have been reunited.

This was not the first time Barton had sort to expose Simpson's idolising of Ferdinand. Earlier this week Barton tweeted a picture of the two sitting down in the dining room.

He said: 'Getting ridiculous @dannysimpson let him have his dinner. Yes, he can remember you from United.'

QPR recently signed Steven Caulker from Cardiff for Â£8m and the former Spurs man is likely to start the season as Ferdinand's partner in central defence. Harry Redknapp's other options include Nedum Onuoha and veterans Richard Dunne and Clint HIll.
