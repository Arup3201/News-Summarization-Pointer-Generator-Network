An ex-convict who served 11 years in prison for the brutal death of an off-duty police officer has been fired as a Chicago little league baseball coach after the dead man's family raised concerns over his suitability to mentor children.

Officer John Matthews was murdered in Hegewisch in 1988 by a group of five young men – including Dean Chavez - who beat him to death with baseball bats.

Matthews’ wife, 23, was left to raise three children under the age of six on her own.

Mathews' son Joey, now 30, told ABC7 that he was incredulous when he found out that one of the men found guilty of murdering his father was coaching kids in the same neighborhood.

‘The fact is, a man who killed another man using a baseball bat is coaching kids to swing a baseball bat. It boggles the mind,’ said Matthews.

Convicted of second degree murder, Chavez was sentenced to 27 years and served 11.

In recent years he has coached youth baseball in the Hegewisch Babe Ruth Baseball program, including a first place finish earlier this summer.

When Joey Mathews approached the league over their failure to carry out a proper background check on Chavez, he claims they tried to sweep the matter under the carpet.

Both he and his mother sent emails to 
Hegewisch baseball officials asking for Chavez to be removed, but were 
told that he was a good coach who didn't compromise the safety of the 
children.

It was only after Mathews approached the national president of the Babe Ruth League, that Chavez was fired.

Now the Mathews family are also seeking the dismissal of the league's five board members, and for the local and national Babe Ruth bylaws to be changed so that this doesn't happen again.

The bylaws currently only cover potential coaches convicted of a sexual offense or an offense against a minor, according to Mathews.

‘Unfortunately, he (Chavez) forfeited 
his 
right to be a role model and a mentor when he took my father’s life,’ 
said Joey's sister Anne, who was six when her father was murdered.

Chavez told ABC7 that he had been trying to make amends and help his community, but said he now has no plans to continue coaching or volunteering.

The league are hosting a meeting on Wednesday evening in Hegewisch to address the matter which Mathews said has opened up old wounds for his mom.

'No one should have to live through this twice,' he said.
