Spring has truly arrived, with sunshine galore - and blossom beginning to appear on trees around Britain.

And there's good news too for cherry-lovers as growers are predicting a bumper crop this year - over the longest and largest season ever recorded.

However, next week's Bank Holiday weekend promises to be 'changeable' after a week of sunshine

While most of the country should bask in 'fine weather' over the coming days, snow is forecast on high ground in northern Scotland.

By the Bank Holiday, only those in the South are promised the best of the weather, averaging around 15C - the same as is expected in London this Sunday.

The
 rest of the country will experience a mixture of sunshine and showers 
and temperatures 'a little bit lower than most people's
 ideal barbecue temperature'.

Helen Chivers, from the Met Office said: 'Our forecast suggests that there's going to be a lot of fine weather in
 the UK over the next few days.

'The Bank Holiday's a little bit lower temperature-wise than most people's ideal BBQ weather.

'I would say at the moment we're looking at temperatures around about normal for April, around 13 to 15C. It's not unusual for this time of year.'

But she added that there may be some colder weather in store for Scots by the Bank Holiday weekend.

'Possibly next week there could be some snow in Scotland, particularly on the high ground.

'We're talking about the areas that are five or six hundred metres above sea level in the far North of Scotland.'

She added: 'During the Easter weekend, it may get a little bit more unsettled across the country generally.

'There will be a lot of dry weather around next week.

'But in the middle of next week we might see more showery conditions.

'We can see that it's going to be changeable.

'We'll see some rain from time to time. But the best weather will be in the South.'

Friday: A mostly dry day with sunny spells and light winds, although an isolated shower is possible.

Stronger winds and outbreaks of rain are expected to reach western Scotland by evening.Outlook for Saturday to Monday: Often windy with rain or showers in northern parts of the UK.

Mostly dry and bright weather further south, however, thicker cloud and some light rain is possible at times.

Tomorrow, forecasters expect sunny weather in the South East and sunny intervals across the North West.

And this Sunday the capital is expected to enjoy a pleasant average temperature of 15C.

Today,
 the Met Office tweeted to warn hayfever sufferers about a 'high' pollen
 count in the London area, and a 'medium' count for the rest of the 
country.

Britain currently has one of the highest rates of hay fever in the world with about 25 per cent of the population suffering.

It is believed that the number of sufferers is likely to more than double to 32million by 2030.

If you are affected, it can be helpful to avoid going outside when the pollen count is high - normally from early to mid-morning - and to avoid cutting the grass.

Experts from the British Cherry industry body believe this year's crop will be double last year's volume - with a bumper harvest of up to 4,000 tonnes. Above, cherry blossom in Greenwich Park

The first cherry harvest of the
 season will probably come a month earlier than usual - and due to millions of 
pounds of investment, thousands of new trees will also blossom.

The boom has been sparked by the fifth warmest winter since records began.

Experts
 from the British Cherry industry body even believe this year’s crop 
will be double last year’s volume - with a bumper harvest of up to 4,000 
tonnes.

A spokesperson for British cherry farmers, said: 'It’s an exciting year for the British cherry industry.

'We’re
 starting to reap the benefits of years of investment to reduce the need
 for imports and give consumers what they want - large, juicy, British 
cherries that can have more sugars than their foreign counterparts.

'We
 are seeing a sweet comeback for British cherries - for the first time 
ever, British cherries will hit the supermarket shelves in early June 
right through to September.'

Growers are benefiting from new investment in smaller trees and polytunnels that protect them from harsh weather and birds.

It enables growers to produce up to four times more cherries per hectare.

The
 average cherry tree takes four years to start fruiting, so growers are 
now starting to reap the benefits of new, early and late season 
varieties.

It means that Britons can expect to see home-grown cherries on the shelves from early June to September.

There has been a concerted campaign to revise the British cherry industry over the past decade.

Only 300 tons of cherries were produced in 2000, with many orchards made up of old, low-yielding trees.

But the industry has been fighting back with new plantings and is growing fast as a result of the changes.

Now
 some of the UK’s top chefs have begun a campaign to encourage the 
public to take pride in this quintessentially British summer fruit.

Celebrity chef Rachel Khoo, who is famous for presenting BBC’s The Little Paris Kitchen, is backing the cherry renaissance.

She said: 'British
 cherries are gorgeous fruit with their lovely plump texture, rich 
colours and stunning blossoms, making them the ultimate summertime 
dessert.

'I’m delighted to be backing British growers, and I urge everyone to get on board and support British.'

There
 has been heavy investment in the industry to meet the demand for the 
ever-popular British fruit which boasts a number of health benefits.

Studies
 have shown cherries can help to prevent cancer and have 
anti-inflammatory properties which are important in combating arthritis 
and heart disease.
