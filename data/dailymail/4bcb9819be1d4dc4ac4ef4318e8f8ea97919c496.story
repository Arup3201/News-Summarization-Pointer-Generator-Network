Anthony Gill has escaped jail despite being caught driving while four times over the legal limit

A repeat drink-driver who got behind the wheel of a car after drinking 12 pints has walked free from court.

Anthony GIll, 38, was handed a 24 week suspended jail term after he was caught four times over the limit when he was stopped by police in Felixstowe, Suffolk.

Tim Passmore, Suffolk Police and Crime Commissioner, has branded the decision 'extraordinary'.

The police chief said JPs had sent out a 'very poor signal' as it emerged that Gill also received a suspended sentence for drink-driving in 2007.

Mr Passmore has said: 'I find this decision extraordinary.

'Driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs is totally unacceptable and the constabulary is very clear in that message.

'While I respect it is the magistrate's decision, as a general principle I feel this sends out a very poor signal.'

Gill, from Felixstowe, was sentenced to 24 weeks in jail, suspended for two years, and banned from driving for five years at South East Suffolk Magistrates' Court, in Ipswich.

He had been drinking for 10 hours on September 7 with a wedding party at the Kesgrave Bell and Kesgrave Community Centre, near Ipswich, before he got in his car to drive home.

The court heard he had drunk 12 pints of lager. When police stopped him he had 153 microgrammes of alcohol per 100 
millilitres of breath. The legal limit is 35mcg.

Magistrate David Broughton told him: 'This offence is so serious that custody is warranted.

'Your alcohol rate was extremely high and showed a blatant disregard for the safety of other road users.

'This was a close-run thing Mr Gill. You came extremely close to going through the door into custody today.'

Police stopped Gill at traffic lights in Felixstowe after he accidentally turned his rear windscreen wipers on and clipped the kerb after a turn.

Hugh Rowlands, defending, said he had planned to go back to his girlfriend's rather than drive home but she had not been able to go to the event following a death in her family.

Mr Rowlands said Gill, a software company manager who earns more than £50,000-a-year, had 'never really recovered' from losing his father in 2011 and would lose his job if jailed.

Road safety campaigner Michelle Luetchford, whose sister Emma was killed by a drink driver in 2009, said outside court: 'If he didn't learn the first time, it's not going to do anything a second time. 

'He could have killed somebody and that would have been a whole different story.'

Mrs Luetchford, of Ipswich, added: 'The sentences should be tougher all round. He should be severely punished.'

A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: 'Drink driving can have devastating consequences which is why the maximum sentence for causing death by drink driving is rightly 14 years in prison.

'There is also no limit to the length of driving bans that a court can impose.

'However, sentences in individual cases are for the courts to decide, taking into account all the circumstances of each case.'
