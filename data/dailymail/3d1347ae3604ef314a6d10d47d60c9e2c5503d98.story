The taxpayer has picked up the bill for private contractors to spend hours trying to persuade ducks to leave the Treasury, it emerged today.

The extraordinary farce of how Labour’s £1billion PFI deal to refurbish the ministry reveals how the firm which now owns the building is crippled by bureaucracy while trying to rid a fountain of their feathered friends.

A logbook of 24 hours in the bizarre world of Whitehall includes conflicting advice about whether an order can be given to scare the ducks and who is responsible for removing bird's mess.

Duck bill: The taxpayer is paying for the private finance contractor who spent 24 hours trying to remove two birds from the Treasury

Quackers: The £1billion PFI deal signed by Labour put the Treasury building in the hands of a contractor

Chancellor George Osborne revealed the absurd contract signed by the Labour government was still tying the Treasury up in knots.

‘It all started eight years ago when two ducks landed in the fountain, do what ducks and there was suddenly nine ducklings,’ the Chancellor said.

At the time a whole team of PFI contractors, civil servants and the RSCPA were called to remove the ducks from the Treasury’s ‘rather expensive water feature’ and take them to Surrey.

In June last year the ducks returned, sending the Facilities Management Help Desk into meltdown.

To much laughter, Mr Osborne proceeded to read the detail of the logbook to a press gallery lunch for journalists in Westminster.

The logbook details the extraordinary level of detail and effort the Treasury staff went to, before discovering that the ducks had removed themselves more successfully than any contractor could manage.

Bird's eye view: The Treasury's 'rather expensive water feature¿ has been plagued by ducks for up to eight years

The Facilities management help desk logbook for incident number 177853 on 20 June 2012 reveals that at 9.02am the initial request was created: ‘Ducks in the courtyard garden. Request presence of an operative.’

By 9.22am an ‘operative was attending incident’. At 10.11am the contractor reported: ‘I attended area and confirmed this is a male and female duck. Issue has been discussed previously with RSPCA, they won’t attend the building for ducks, and I called Royal Parks but they also won’t come remove  ducks as it may cause injury to the duck and people in this area.

‘They have advised us to put signs requesting that people do not feed the ducks, and also to frighten them frequently so they don’t feel comfortable here, they should then leave of their own accord. Advised seniors of the above.’

The problem then seemed solved, but by 10.40am there was a u-turn. ‘Please ignore previous,’ the logbook stated.

‘Have been advised that signs should not be put up yet without permission, and that the birds should not be frightened – we are responsible for guano only, not removing the birds. Awaiting further instructions.’

Several hours later the situation escalated, with a plan to remove the ducks altogether.

‘Have been advised that previous instances required the ducks to be caught and removed as there is insufficient space in the courtyard for ducks to take off,’ the contractor wrote at 1.10pm.

‘Message left for operative to contact the Help Desk.’

The drama rolled into the next day, when an update was posted at 9am. ‘No ducks in the pond and disturbed all the bushed. No ducks present. Seems they have left on their own.’

To huge laughter, Mr Osborne told journalists: ‘That ladies and gentlemen is how your money is spent.’

Soon after the coalition was formed in 2010, the Chancellor revealed that the PFI deal meant that a Christmas tree for the Treasury had cost £800.

PFI schemes allow governments to put off raising upfront money for new buildings.

Instead, a private company is given a lengthy contract to build a school or hospital and then provides related ‘services’ to the public sector.

The Government leases the building for the length of the contract before it reverts to public ownership.

Earlier this year it emerged the contractor which owns the Treasury building had rented it out for a scene in Fast and Furious 6.

The owner of the building hired it out to producers as a location for the Hollywood blockbuster, featuring fast cars and dancing girls

The circular court of the Treasury building was transformed into an underground nightclub in the latest movie in the series starring Vin Diesel.

Producers used it as a dramatic location for the Hollywood blockbuster, featuring fast cars and dancing girls.

Official figures show that 544 PFI projects such as new school and hospital buildings were launched since 1997.

The original capital cost of the projects agreed under the Labour government was £51.5billion.

But repayments for these will have rocketed to an eye-watering total of £245billion by 2047/8, according to the Treasury.
