A Muslim man has launched a petition asking YouTube to remove Katy Perry's new video from their site because it shows her disintegrating a man wearing a pendant which reads 'Allah'.

In the Dark Horse video Perry plays a princess in ancient Egypt trying to chose a male suitor.

One by one the suitors arrive with gifts which displease the princess, and the men are turned into sand by lightning Perry shoots from her fingers.

By modern standards Perry's new offering could have been considered tame, but has sparked controversy after Shazad Iqbal noticed the first suitor wearing a necklace which reads 'Allah.'

Shazad Iqbal has launched a petition calling for Katy Perry's latest video to be taken down from YouTube after he noticed a pendant with the world 'Allah' in Arabic being disintegrated

The Muslim man, from Bradford, England, has now started a petition calling for YouTube to take the video down, alleging it 'promotes blasphemy'.

The online form has attracted nearly 40,000 signatures from countries across the world, including Australia, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

In the complaint, Mr Iqbal said: 'The video is considered as highly controversial to its viewers as a result of its portrayal of blasphemy.

'Blasphemy is clearly conveyed in the video, since Katy Perry (who appears to be representing an opposition of God) engulfs the believer and the word God in flames.

'This is the reason for lodging the petition so that people from different walks of life, different religions and from different parts of the world, agree that the video promotes blasphemy.

The petition claims that the video 'promotes blasphemy' and urges people from around the world to sign, arguing that no religion would tolerate the name God being used in a 'disrespectful manner'

The petition has collected 40,000 signatures from countries including Australia, India and Saudi Arabia

'Using the name of God in an irrelevant and distasteful manner would be considered inappropriate by any religion '

After signing the petition, Bilal Khan, from Birmingham, said: 'Absolutely Disgusted at the music industry for allowing this to happen, music should be about spreading love not hate.

It's shameful that you allow stupidity, you need to look up the meaning of the word explicit.'

Fellow signatory Taufik Hidayat, from Bandung, Indonesia, added: 'This video is really offensive to [the] Muslim faith!'

Dark Horse is Perry's third single off her new album 'Prism' and features American rapper Juicy J.

The hip-hop infused pop song is currently sitting at number one on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 list.

The international pop star released the music video on February 20 on her official Twitter page to her more than 50 million followers. It currently has almost 30 million views.

Katy Perry's record label could not be reached for comment at the time of going to print.
