Meet the paw-casso painters creating artworks worth up to £130 at a Florida zoo - using their paws, tongues and noses.

The talented big cats - including tigers, Siberian lynx and leopards - produce abstract paintings in their enclosures at Big Cat Rescue sanctuary in Tampa, Florida.

The finished artworks are then sold in a nearby shop for anywhere between £30 and £130 - with profits put back into the sanctuary to pay for caring for the animals.

Jeff Kremer, from Big Cat Rescue, said: 'The cat paintings were a roaring success with the sanctuary's supporters.

'The individuals who purchased these paintings told us that they just loved being able to own such a one of a kind and personal piece of artwork to show off to their family and friends.

So far 50 masterpieces have been sold - with many more in the pipeline.

The cats use safe non-toxic children's finger paint, which they roll, walk and lick over the canvas to create colourful results.

The activity is part of the cats' enrichment programme, which aims to keep the cats mentally stimulated.

Jeff added: 'Most of the cats absolutely love being able to take part in the process of painting.

'The truth is that the cats simply love doing something new and different.

'It is the main focus of the sanctuary's Enrichment Program.

'We are always researching new and safe ways to keep the cats stimulated.'

'Individuals that have purchased these 
paintings tend to base their selection of artwork based on either their 
favourite cat at the sanctuary, or a unique pattern that they see in the
artwork.'
