Nobody should be shocked that Alexis Sanchez is doing what he's doing. Anybody who watched him at Barcelona, and Udinese before that, were well aware of this guy's class and quality, his work-rate and attitude.

Signing him was a no-brainer, I hope Arsenal didn't waste too much money on scouting reports on a signing who was so obviously going to improve what they had. But fair play to Arsene Wenger for making it happen.

I look for shrewdness and value when it comes to judging transfers. Signing players all of us knew were good doesn't make you a sharp operator in the market. And as good as Alexis has been, he didn't solve the more obvious problems holding Arsenal back.

And this is where Wenger has to put his reputation on the line.

Alexis Sanchez has been in sensational form for Arsenal this season and his signing was an inspired one

Despite the shrewd signing of Sanchez, Arsene Wenger still has plenty of problems to solve at Arsenal

Theo Walcott has made his return after nine months out injured and is a major weapon for Wenger

He has Alexis in fine form, and Theo Walcott ready to return. Those two could cause havoc – I'm excited at the prospect of seeing them both play together for a run of games.

But with other areas of the team in need of repair and quality, Wenger needs to finally have a good January transfer window.

He needs to sign players who solve problems – just as Jose Mourinho did when he landed Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa this summer.

For years the Wenger apologists have used the building of an expensive stadium to excuse his lack of success. They nodded in pathetic agreement when he declared fourth place is a trophy. He built a stadium with his bare hands and did well to reach the Champions League at the same time.

That's been the mantra. If that's true, Wenger has to follow it up with years of sustained Premier League and Champions League domination to make it all worthwhile. Let's see if that happens.

Arsenal currently find themselves fourth in the Premier League table - a familiar position in recent times

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho brought in Cesc Fabregas to solve his midfield problem in the summer - now Wenger must do likewise at Arsenal in January

That mantra also ignores Wenger's more obvious tactical failings – witness the destruction suffered at Liverpool and Chelsea last season - and the consistent failure to compete with big teams tactically, his inability to change games with substitutions or systems. He keeps making the same errors.

But regardless of your view on Wenger – and even Arsenal fans are split on whether the manager should stay or go – they now have Alexis and Walcott, a potentially lethal combination. So what will Wenger do in January to enhance the club's chances of winning the title, or being European champions?

Now, the pressure is on Wenger. Just how good is he? What can he do in January? Surely he won't sit back and admire his shiny Sanchez, hoping that Abou Diaby will stay fit to solve his midfield problems? Surely he can spot the weaknesses and address them in January?

Previously the Arsenal manager has questioned the quality available in this upcoming window. Well last January is when Chelsea signed Nemanja Matic, a player who would definitely improve Arsenal right now.

Wenger has promised to sign a defender in January, he also needs a holding midfielder and a truly top-class goalkeeper in my opinion.

The stadium is built, the money is there, no more excuses. The problems in the team seem obvious, but will the manager do his job and solve them?

Now is the time even his biggest apologists will surely judge Wenger.
