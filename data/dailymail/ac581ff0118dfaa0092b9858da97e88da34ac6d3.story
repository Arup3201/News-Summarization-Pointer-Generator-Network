NRL CEO Dave Smith has vowed to eliminate players from the game if they continue to misbehave

The NRL has vowed to clean up the sport's off-field image with boss Dave Smith announcing a zero-tolerance policy for players who misbehave.

Under a bold initiative to improve player standards in the code, Mr Smith is set to introduce significant reforms including a no tolerance approach to individuals who play-up off the field and a $1 million fine for clubs if they fail to keep clean financial records.

It is part of his pledge to move the game out of its troubled limelight - which most recently saw Todd Carney sacked and Newcastle Knight Darius Boyd stood down - towards a more family-friendly atmosphere.

The NRL boss told The Saturday Telegraph that players and clubs will feel the full force of the new rules and that if they don't comply will be heavily sanctioned.

Clubs receive an annual funding of $7.5 million from a central fund. Mr Smith said that if if they fail to appoint skilled directors, keep an annual business log or monthly financial records will risk losing $1 million of that funding.

Darius Boyd, who trashed a Hunter Valley hotel room, is seeking treatment for depression and has stepped away from the game indefinitely

The now infamous bubbler incident which may end Todd Carney's playing career

On individuals, he said players who continue to commit 'indiscretions outside the boundaries of what the general community expects' will face consequences.

'It may be you don’t have a career in the game any more.'

Part of his succession plan as taking over from former NRL boss David Gallop in 2013 was to move the game in a more family-friendly direction and the only way for it to succeed in the future was to do just that.

He said it was vital that the sport turn itself into a code women and children can enjoy, and mothers played an important role in its future.

While he stressed the great majority of players did the right thing, there were players who had been guilty of poor behaviour 'as we’ve seen recently.'

The list of names bringing the game into disrepute is endless, but more recently include Todd Carney, Mitchell Pearce and Blake Ferguson.

In June, Carney, 28, had his Cronulla Sharks contract terminated for the now infamous 'bubbling' image which circulated on social media.

It was followed just days ago by the standing-down of Newcastle Knight Darius Boyd who trashed a Hunter Valley hotel room causing $1500 worth of damage.

Boyd, 27, said he had depression and has stepped aside from his commitments with the Newcastle Knights while he undergoes treatment.

It is unlikely Carney will ever play again but Boyd will likely return to the game, albeit most likely for a different club other than Newcastle.

Meanwhile others names which have lead the NRL to make a stand on player behaviour include Mitchell Pearce, who back in May was sacked from State-Of-Origin commitments when he was embroiled in a Kings Cross nightclub incident.

Pearce was arrested and issued with a $500 fine.

Newcastle Knight and former Warriors forward Russell Packer is serving a two-year jail term for assaulting a bouncer in November 2013, but has been linked with a return to the Penrith Panthers pending his parole.

Last year, sacked Canberra Raider Blake Ferguson who self-destructed when he went awol during the Raiders 2013 rugby league season.

Smith said: “We’ve seen a number of incidents over a long period of time and there’s a line being drawn here that says we’re not going to accept that going forward,’’ he told The Saturday Telegraph.
