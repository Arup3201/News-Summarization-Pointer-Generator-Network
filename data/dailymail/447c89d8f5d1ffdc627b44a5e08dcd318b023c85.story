Relaxed, composed, striking just the right balance between laughs and the serious business of his lifelong ambition, Stephen Gallacher has taken to the whole Ryder Cup experience with an ease bordering on aplomb. Long may it continue, right?

From sit-downs with Sir Alex to voicemails from Martin O’Neill, massive crowds for practice days to the enjoyable oddness of individual rivals sharing a team room and a common cause, there is plenty about this week that could overwhelm the average rookie.

As Gallacher points out, though, he’s not exactly wet behind those trademark lugs.

Ryder Cup rookie Stephen Gallacher says he's raring to go

At the age of 39, he has seen almost everything that golf has to offer. And, if this can never be described as just another tournament, the fact he comes from a real Ryder Cup family means he is as ready as any debutant could ever be.

‘I am better prepared for this now than I would have been 10 years ago,’ he said. ‘I think I am a better golfer and I feel ready for playing now, yeah.

‘You know, you try to get in the Ryder Cup, you know there’s going to be things attached to it, more media and more spotlight. If you don’t fancy that, well, there’s no point in trying to get in it. It’s just part and parcel.

‘You’re going to get people on the tee and you’re going to get expectations. The key is to just embrace that and stick to what you’ve been doing that got you here.

‘It was my lifetime ambition. It was my goal to get here. I’m proud I’m sitting here. I am very excited and it is a bit surreal still, because I live so close.

Stephen Gallacher says playing on home soil will help his Ryder Cup chances

‘I’m 39 years old. I’m not a rookie to golf. I’m maybe a rookie to the Ryder Cup, but I think having it in my home country is making it a bit easier to adapt as a rookie.

‘There was a point where I definitely thought it had passed me by. But I made a conscious effort a couple years ago to get in this one. Especially for my generation, it’s never going to be here again.

‘I think every Scot would want to be here. What’s better than to play at Gleneagles for your first one? If I could have picked it myself, I would have picked it here.’

He certainly couldn’t have chosen a more passionate gallery, with the crowds following him around his practice round on Wednesday — still 48 hours before the main event starts — bigger than anything he’ll have experienced at this venue.

The fact that almost everyone outside the ropes, watching on TV or following his exploits in newspapers will be urging him on has to help, of course.

He certainly looks far from fazed by the level of support he’s receiving from all quarters.

A keen football fan, more specifically a Celtic supporter, Gallacher enjoyed Tuesday night’s pep talk from Sir Alex Ferguson as much as anyone. And almost as much as he liked getting a good-luck message from former Celtic manager O’Neill.

‘It was nice to hear Sir Alex Ferguson talk last night,’ he said. ‘I thought he was brilliant.

‘He spoke for half an hour and then we asked him some questions, and he was very candid and open.

‘Yeah, there’s bits that I definitely would take away from it, not just as a team aspect, but for progression going forward.

‘You can see why the Manchester United players respected him so much and how he won 13 titles in 21 goes. You can see his passion for the game and how much he loves football, and how much he loves the strategy and the game.

‘He misses it a bit, he said, but he’s an absolute legend in my eyes.

‘I’ve had a lot of good-luck messages, pretty much just from all my friends, and I had one from Martin O’Neill, which was nice.

‘I spoke to him a couple of times, because he’s Paul McGinley’s friend and he spoke to me at the Masters and then he sent me a voicemail. He just said: “Well done for getting in. You’ll love the team environment. Probably one of the best weeks of your life”. And he’s right, it will be.’

Gallacher obviously sought out his uncle Bernard for advice ahead of this week, revealing: ‘I spent the week with him when my gran was ill in the hospital.

‘He was sort of chatting away, basically giving us good advice, nothing new that I’ve had from the five backroom staff or the guys on the team. Certainly he’s experienced enough, he’s played in eight, been captain three times and been vice-captain, too.’

The one thing everyone will have been talking to the new boys about is that unique experience on the first tee.

Here at Gleneagles, the underpass leading to it has been painted with images of European and American legends, captain McGinley admitting he wants his players to feel ‘like gladiators entering the arena’ when they emerge into the light and noise.

‘I’m hoping I’m going to really enjoy it,’ said Gallacher, sounding just like the boy who grew up dreaming of Ryder Cup glory above any individual prize as he revealed: ‘You come under the tunnel and the last person you see is Seve.

Stephen Gallacher says he's relishing the first tee at Gleneagles later this week

‘You come up the tunnel, go up the hill and walk around — and it’s like walking into a football stadium.

‘It was full yesterday, they were 10 deep. And I hit a good drive! So, hopefully on Friday, I can just try to imagine it’s Tuesday.

‘The good thing for me is I’ve never experienced it. Your nerves are what you make them, really.

‘The first tee at the Masters was pretty good and the first tee playing at St Andrews is nice.

‘I know this is going to be tougher, but I’m hopefully going to enjoy it.’
