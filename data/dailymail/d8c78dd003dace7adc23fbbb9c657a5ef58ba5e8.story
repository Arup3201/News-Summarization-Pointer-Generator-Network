Nudists are to be banned from one of Britain's most famous beaches that featured in Shakespeare In Love amid fears it is being invaded by sex swingers and 'perverts'.

Naturists are being told to cover up on the nationally-renowned sands at Holkham, near Wells, north Norfolk, after complaints about lewd and anti-social behaviour.

The beach, which is part of Holkham Estate, was the setting for the final scene of the Oscar winning film when Gwyneth Paltrow survives a shipwreck.

Nudists will be banned from Holkham Beach in Norfolk after concerns about 'swingers and perverts'

Holkham Estate has moved to close the special nudist zone on the western section of the sweeping beach from July 1 after they discussed the growing outdoor sex crisis with police.

It has acted as concern mounts locally over incidents of public indecency on the stunning stretch of the east coast, which attracts about 500,000 people every year.

The ban comes after a Facebook campaign was launched in the summer of 2010 to crack down on sex pests roaming the sands.

Locals have complained about people having sex in public and propositioning beach-goers.

One campaigner wrote in August 2010: 'My last three visits to the beach have seen me propositioned twice.

'I've witnessed gay sex in the sand dunes and men walking around "playing".

'I've reported this to the wardens and local PCSO but nothing has been done.

'The beach used to be a lovely place to go but now it's just a haven for swingers and perverts who won't take no for an answer.'

Norfolk Police said at the time that 
officers were investigating reports that beach-goers had been acting in 
an 'inappropriate manner'.

Conservation manager Sarah Henderson said 'persistent anti-social behaviour' forced them into the ban

The
western section of Holkham beach has been a designated destination for 
naturists for a number of years and is flagged up on swinging and 
dogging websites.

Sarah Henderson, conservation manager at the Holkham Estate, said last night: 'It is sad that we have been forced to take this step due to the persistent anti-social behaviour of a minority of people.

'The management and control of these activities has been an increasing concern to me and my team who look after the reserve so we have had to take action to ban all nudism.

'We have consulted with the police and discussed the issues and options.

'The decision has been made to implement a total ban for the better management and future safety of all our visitors.'

Signs will be erected to highlight the new order and Holkham Estate wardens will be patrolling the beach to ensure visitors comply with the new policy.

They have been instructed to tell any 
naturists to put their clothes on and if they refuse they face being 
arrested and prosecuted.

A Facebook group was set up three years ago trying to ban naturists from Holkham Beach

Holkham National Nature Reserve, which includes the beach, is managed by Holkham Estate.

The dunes are owned and managed by the estate.

The beautiful beach is owned by the Crown Estate and managed by Natural England.

Both organisations were consulted over the decision but naturist groups have reacted angrily to the news.

Andrew
Welch, a spokesman for British Naturism, said: 'Many of our members 
enjoy coming to this beautiful part of the country to sunbathe on the 
beach and socialise with like-minded people without causing any 
problems.

'Unfortunately some people see being nude as an excuse to misbehave and it is a great shame that a small minority of trouble-makers ruin it for all of us.

'These people should be dealt with by the police. If 20 people out of 20,000 in a football stadium cause trouble they don't close the whole stadium.

'So it is a shame that the Holkham Estate has come to make this decision and we would like to open some dialogue with them about this.'

Holkham beach, which is part of Holkham National Nature Reserve, attracts about 500,000 visitors a year. 

It was the setting of the final scene in the Oscar-winning film Shakespeare In Love. The film ends with Gwyneth Paltrow walking along the sand. 

Natural England has described it as one of the most important and heavily  visited sites in the UK. 

The beach is backed by a pine forest and is renowned for being one of the best stretches of unspoiled coastline in the UK. 

It regularly makes the list of the most recommended naturist beaches. 

The stretch of sand has also played host to a Royal holiday.

In 1957, the Queen, Prince Philip and a young Princess Anne and Prince Charles spent time on the beach.

The conservation area is also a favourite among twitchers as a variety of birds graze along the salt marshes.

The beach, which features about three miles of unspoiled sand, is largely man-made. 

It was reclaimed from the sea in the 19th Century by the 2nd Earl of Leicester, who planted pine trees to stabilise the sand.
