A man who spent more than two decades behind bars was freed on Friday after DNA evidence cleared him in the rape of a 14-year-old Fort Worth girl.

David Lee Wiggins was convicted and sentenced to life in prison in 1989, although neither of the two fingerprints found at the scene matched his.

The girl, whose face was covered during most of the attack, picked Wiggins out of a photo lineup and then a live lineup, saying he looked familiar.

But DNA testing earlier this month excluded Wiggins as the person who committed the crime. Tarrant County prosecutors said DNA evidence demonstrated his innocence.

'I really believed him,' said Nina Wagnor who worked as a legal assistant fighting for him until 2007 told the Star Telegram.

In a step beyond her call of duty, after meeting him during a visit to the Tarrant County Jail in 1989 to see her son, she married Wiggins for 17 years to better access all his information during his legal battle.

'Since I wasn't married to him, I couldn't find out a whole lot,' Wagnor said. 'He asked me if I would marry him and I said, “I will.”’

In December that year, with Wiggins wearing leg shackles before a Justice of the Peace, the couple said 'I do.'

'I never had no doubt. I thought how could anybody see all this stuff and not know that he's innocent, that he didn't do this. How could anyone not know?' she told the paper.

Concluding a 24-year-long sentence this week, State District Judge Louis Sturns in Fort Worth freed Wiggins on a personal bond after approving a motion to overturn his conviction.

Before the crime is officially cleared from his record, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals must accept the judge's recommendation or the governor must grant a pardon. Either step is considered a formality after the judge's ruling.

'I hold no bitterness,' Wiggins said in court after the judge's ruling. 'I'm thankful to Jesus Christ. He said he could move mountains, and surely this was a mountain. ... And to the victim: I'm not mad at you. I don't hold you responsible.'

The packed courtroom erupted into applause following his statement and people rose to their feet.

Wiggins later hugged his relatives and some other men who have been freed from prison after DNA evidence exonerated them in recent years. About a dozen of them attended the court hearing to support Wiggins.

'We draw strength from each other,' said Charles Chatman, who was freed in 2008 after serving nearly 27 years for a rape he did not commit. 'We're the only people who know what we are going through.'

Wiggins, who wore a blue shirt and tan pants, said his immediate plans included eating a hamburger and spending time with his sister who is a former police officer. She herself has said she never lost faith in her brother who learned he had been adopted into their family when he was just a teenager.

'He has had problems in the past but that isn't the kind of thing he would have done,' Candy Berg told the Telegram.

'He's amazingly honest about what he has done, even when I was a cop. He would have told me about it. We're a pretty close family,' she said.

'He was a little criminal, don't get me wrong,' Wagnor told the paper, adding that she only divorced him in 2007 to collect social security benefits from her late ex-husband when she fell into bad health.

'But he never did nothing like that. It was penny ante stuff,' she said.

Being in the wrong place at the wrong time, Wagnor said Wiggins was placed in a lineup of potential suspects for the rape because of his past convictions for burglary and his similar age, race and description provided by the victim.

Wiggins said he agreed to be in that police lineup in 1988 because he knew that he didn't commit the crime and thought he had nothing to worry about.

Instead, it led to a 24-year nightmare.

Wagnor said she helped him for years fight the charges against him but felt that 'everything we did just got shoved back at us.'

She said that she remembers him writing to the nonprofit group the Innocence Project while in jail, but didn't know anything had come from it.

Repayment: After his conviction is formally reversed, Wiggins will be eligible for $80,000 a year in compensation that Texas pays to wrongfully convicted ex-inmates

It was that group who made the request for the DNA tests, something Wagnor had done herself but at the time of her battle was told that the sample collected at the crime scene was too small.

'I always believed the truth would come out,' he said on Friday.

He will now live with a friend he met through his church ministry, according to the Innocence Project, whose attorneys started working on his case in 2007 - the same year Wagnor said she lost touch with him.

After his conviction is formally reversed, Wiggins will be eligible for $80,000 a year in compensation that Texas pays to wrongfully convicted ex-inmates.

Wiggins would be the second person to have a conviction overturned by DNA in Tarrant County since 2001.

In neighboring Dallas County, more than 30 people have had convictions overturned since 2001. About 80 per cent of wrongful convictions in Texas are due to faulty witness identifications, said Cory Session, whose half-brother Timothy Cole was wrongfully convicted in a 1985 rape and died in prison before he was declared innocent.

Session said a Texas law passed last year requires all law enforcement agencies to adopt better procedures when using eyewitness identifications.
