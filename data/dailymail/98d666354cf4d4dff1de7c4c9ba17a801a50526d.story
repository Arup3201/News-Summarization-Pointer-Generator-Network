Dr Richard Smith, a kidney consultant, started up an affair with a patient after he saw her undress

A kidney specialist began a secret affair with his patient saying he ‘couldn’t get her out of his head’ after she undressed in his examination room, a tribunal heard.

Dr Richard Smith, 53, became infatuated with the married woman after he asked her to take off her top so he could look at a rash on her back.

A consultant in renal medicine, he began exchanging flirtatious text messages with his patient before they eventually became lovers, meeting in hotel rooms across the UK.

The woman, a diabetic who had a kidney transplant in 2011, was under the care of the Oxford and Cambridge-educated doctor at Southmead Hospital, Bristol.

But a tribunal in Manchester heard that despite their relationship, married Dr Smith continued treating the woman, named only as Patient A.

He faces a fitness to practice tribunal and could be struck off if misconduct is proved. 

Ciaran Rankin, for the General Medical Council, told the hearing: ‘Patient A felt the relationship between herself and the doctor changed following a particular visit she had made in relation to a rash.

‘The appointment, in the company of her husband, meant she had to take her top off.

‘On the next occasion when she visited she was approached by the doctor and he asked her to come into his consultation room. 

'Once there he described to Patient A that he couldn’t get the image of her out of his mind, which left her feeling flattered.’

Mr Rankin said the pair called and texted each other, and later met in the lobby of a hotel.

Patient A had been under the care of Dr Richard Smith at Southmead Hospital in Bristol since 2008 

They discussed their unhappiness at home and eventually kissed, the tribunal heard.

After sleeping together for the first time in a Travelodge outside Bristol, the pair went on to meet up in Cardiff, Newcastle, Oxford and London.

The tribunal heard the eight-month affair, which began in February 2012, only came to light after the patient’s husband became suspicious.

Once the hospital launched an investigation, Dr Smith and his wife tried to convince Patient A to keep quiet, it was alleged.

Dr Smith admitted the sexual relationship and denied asking the woman to stay silent. His contract with the NHS Trust was terminated in May 2013.

The hearing continues.
