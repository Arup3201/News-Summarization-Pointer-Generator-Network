'Flagrant breach': Nigel Smith has been fined £250,000 for breaching a planning enforcement notice on five occasions

A man who flouted planning laws to set up an 'eyesore' business park on land at his farm is facing a record £250,000 fine - after the council used Google Earth to catch him out.

Businessman Nigel Smith, 57, laid down hardcore to form a compound at the rural spot near Doncaster in 2009, before gradually adding a residential caravan, portable offices and shipping containers - all without planning permission.

Smith continued to operate out of the site at Manor Farm, Moss, despite being fined £2,000 in November 2011 for failing to comply with an enforcement notice issued by Doncaster Council.

Now - after the authority's planning team used a Google Earth image to demonstrate Smith's intrusion into a green field site - the businessman will face prison if he does not pay out £250,000 for his 'flagrant breach' within 30 days.

Smith was convicted at Sheffield Crown Court after pleading guilty to breaching Doncaster Council's enforcement notice on five occasions during late 2011 and 2012.

He was warned in court that he faces a two year jail sentence if he does not pay the enormous fine - thought to be the biggest ever for breaking planning laws - by the time the 30 days are up.

Smith is understood to have been running various businesses out of the lot, which one neighbour in Moss has likened to a concentration camp.

The landlord of the Star Inn pub, which 
is on the same road as Smith's farm, said the businessman had created an eyesore.

'He's put up huge bright flood lights and high barbed wire fences, it looks like a concentration camp,' said Malcolm Bulmer.

'He's
 running Internet businesses from there and has employed a load of 
Polish people to run them for him, but I've no idea what the businesses 
are,' added the 56-year-old, who claimed the development has affected lunchtime trade at his pub.

'We are in a quiet rural area where people used to come out for their Sunday lunches. But no one wants to sit and eat looking at that monstrosity he's built.'

Smith has said he intends to appeal against the fine, and against the way Doncaster Council dealt with earlier requests he submitted for planning permission.

Speaking outside Sheffield Crown Court he said: 'A planning inspectorate in Bristol assured me the containers would not be a problem.

'I brought in the caravans for my polish workers - they need somewhere to live.

'I run a butchery, a market stall in Doncaster and two coal mines. I know what I'm doing when it comes to business,' Smith added.

Smith was ordered to pay Doncaster Council's costs of around £13,500 in full at Monday's hearing.

Sentencing him, Mr Recorder Hubbard QC said it was 'difficult to imagine such a flagrant breach in defiance of the enforcement notices'.

Fine: Smith has been given 30 days to pay the enormous £250,000 fine, or face a prison sentence of up to two years

'Pleased': Doncaster Mayor Peter Davies welcomed the result of the hearing, which saw Smith ordered to pay the council's costs

Doncaster Mayor Peter Davies said he was pleased with the result of the hearing. 'It sends a clear message that Doncaster Council will not tolerate people using land for unlawful and inappropriate purposes,' he said.

'We will always seek to prosecute in these cases.

'We have a planning investigation team who gather evidence, which help build our cases. The team will use whatever tools they have available, in this case Google earth was one of those used.  'The Google earth image showed the intrusion on the green field site, which definitely helped the judge with his decision,' Mr Davies explained. 'He was able to see the transition from green field to a developed site.'
