Prince Harry has proved he's up to speed with modern technology after becoming the first member of the royal family to feature in a series of GIFs.

The 30-year-old appears in the animated images, which you can view below, to promote Guillemot, an independent film funded by The Royal Foundation, of which Prince Harry is patron.

Dressed casually in navy chinos with a zip-up jumper and jacket worn over a shirt, the prince - famed for his cheeky sense of humour - is seen sharing a joke with the actors in one of the animated images.

The prince has previously proved he's up-to-date with the technological era as the Royal Foundation - which he runs with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - joined Twitter and Instagram last month.

A tweet from the Full Effect account yesterday shared the GIFs for the first time writing: 'We are excited to have worked alongside @KensingtonRoyal to create the first ever Royal GIFs with #PrinceHarry'

The Guillemot film has been made as part of the Full Effect project - a community initiative in St Ann's, Nottingham, aimed at tackling problems including youth violence and gangs, as well as improving opportunities for the young people involved.

Prince Harry travelled to Nottingham yesterday to be reunited with the cast and crew and watch the premiere of the film at the city's Cineworld multiplex.

Before the screening started, the prince made a speech in which he explained the aims and achievements of the project and how it intended to 'create young leaders'. 

He added: 'This project means a lot to me. I can really feel the passion here. There's a positive future out there for all of us. Please keep aiming high. Well done.'

Harry has taken a special interest in Full Effect and yesterday was his third visit to see it in action.

Many of the teenagers who spoke to Harry said they had met him before, and one said he was becoming a 'regular visitor' to the area.

Harry spent more than half-an-hour talking to the film-makers, including the star of the 30-minute movie, Tylar Slaney, 18.

Danny Mulvany, 16, said he plays the main villain in the film.

He said: 'It's an honour meeting him everytime - it's good. I've met him three times now.

'It makes the youth feel like there's hope - we can do things. There's people looking at us right now and actually seeing that we've got talent, they can actually see that we're creative people.'

Danny said it was good news for St Ann's.

'It definitely means a lot because we haven't had these things happen for a long time, so for Harry to come back again and show his respect is very good.'

Danny added: 'If you meet him, you'll know he's definitely a good guy.'

Micaiah Jackson, 17 - who plays Biggs in the film, said: 'Harry definitely seemed interested, I think he's passionate about it. It looks like he's got a real drive to help us out, help us do more and get up there.

'He wanted to know if we enjoyed it, what kind of thing we wanted to do in the future, what kind of path we want to go down and if we want to carry on doing more films.'

During his speech, Harry praised the way the project has 'created young leaders'

Harry met the young movie-makers as part of a longer visit to the primary school, during which he talked to youngsters involved in a range of after-school activities provided as part of the Full Effect project.

He joked with children showing him round their eco-garden and examined the handiwork of a group learning basic bike maintenance.

The Full Effect project is training a group of young people to be fully qualified youth leaders and also supports primary school children by providing the extra curricular activities.
