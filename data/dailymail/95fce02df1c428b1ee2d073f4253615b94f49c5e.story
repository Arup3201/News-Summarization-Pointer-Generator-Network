Foo Fighters legend Dave Grohl has a reputation for being the nicest man in rock music - and he  lived up to the title during the band's concert in Sydney.

During the show on Wednesday night, 46-year-old Grohl noticed a banner being held up by a blind man in the front row of the ANZ Stadium.

The sign read: 'drum stick for a blind guy plz’ and Grohl obliged, grabbing a stick from drummer Taylor Hawkins in between songs and handing the highly-prized memento to the man with the banner.

During the Foo Fighters concert in Sydney on Wednesday night, 46-year-old Grohl noticed a banner being held up by a blind man in the front row of the ANZ Stadium 

On Tuesday night the band kicked off the Australian leg of their Sonic Highways world tour in Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium before taking to the Sydney stage on Wednesday night. 

Grohl and the Foo Fighters gave the fans what they wanted, playing old favourites and some classic covers from their 20-year career.

However, Grohl went that extra yard with his super fan, singling him out from the rest of the crowd and giving him the momento of his dreams.

Grohl walked over to the blind fan and gave him the best momento of the night 

'There’s a guy in the front row he’s got a sign that says ‘drum stick for a blind guy’', the former Nirvana member said into the microphone.

The band then casually continued with their set, as the audience whooped in delight. 

However, one family were left upset at the Sydney concert when Grohl didn't dedicate his hit song My Hero to a boy who died earlier this month from septicaemia.

Despite being petitioned by family and friends of Kim online, the band failed to mention that they were singing the song in tribute to 12-year-old Blake Roberts.

The song was played at Blake's funeral last week, and after the mother of four decided to attend the concert, friends and strangers rallied around to get the band to mention the young fan to the 80,000 strong crowd at the sold out concert.

A social media campaign was started on Wednesday by Kim's friend Marg Lucan.

While the group didn't dedicate the track to the young leukaemia patient, they did invite Kim, Marg and their group, which is understood to have included his 17-year-old sister Ellie, to a VIP area backstage at the concert. 

Earlier in the afternoon, Marg thanked those who shared her initial post of Kim's request for the on-stage dedication.

In the emotional message, she wrote light-heartedly: 'Blake always wanted to be famous.' 

'Let's hope his name gets mentioned in front of 80,000 screaming fans tonight.

'I can see him smiling at the very thought of this! Just quietly, it's looking good!' Marg said.

The 12-year-old from Wattle Grove in Sydney's South had been battling leukemia for the past six months.

But just weeks after the family were given the good news that Blake wouldn't need a bone marrow transplant, he contracted the deadly infection and passed away on February 14.

The Foo Fighters tour started in South Africa, back in December, before moving to South America for several performances and then on to Australia.

The band had a special guest in the audience on Tuesday in Brisbane, as Johnny Depp, Down Under to film the next Pirates Of The Caribbean film, was seen backstage prior to the show.
