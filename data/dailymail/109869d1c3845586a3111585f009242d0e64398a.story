Barcelona still support Catalonia's push to vote on secession from the rest of Spain despite warnings that independence will mean the club's exclusion from La Liga.

Barecelona were 'one of the first institutions to declare it was in favour of the right to decide,' a statement read on Friday.

Catalonia's regional government wants to hold a non-binding referendum on independence on November 9. A Spanish court has suspended the vote to rule on its legality.

On Tuesday, the president of the Spanish football league, Javier Tebas, said Barcelona and the other football teams in the north-eastern region would be excluded from Spanish competitions if Catalonia became a separate state.

Tebas said the country's sports law entitles only one non-Spanish territory - Andorra - to legally participate in the league or other official competitions. If Catalonia were to gain independence, the law would have to be altered to let Catalan clubs, including Espanyol and second division teams Girona and Sabadell, back in.

Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema said he wanted Barcelona in the league, which is historically dominated by the two rival clubs.

'We hope that Barca stays in the league,' Benzema said. 'We are two great clubs, Madrid and Barcelona. We need Barcelona in the league.'

The independence movement has a vast majority of support in the region

Secessionist sentiment has surged in Catalonia in recent years during Spain's economic stagnation, and Barcelona's Nou Camp has become a focal point of the movement with pro-independence cheers a common feature during matches.

Barcelona defender Gerard Pique recently attended a massive rally in Barcelona clamoring for the November 9 vote, and former coach Pep Guardiola is an independence supporter.

Polls show that while most of the 7.5 million residents of Catalonia support the vote, only around half favour ending centuries-old ties with the rest of Spain.

In April, the Spanish parliament voted down a request by Catalonia to hold the referendum, but regional lawmakers went ahead with plans and formally called the referendum last month.

The Spanish government argues that such a vote would violate the Spanish Constitution's stipulation that only the national government can call referendums on sovereignty, and that all Spaniards are entitled to vote in such a ballot.

Legal experts expect the court to strike down the regional Catalan law that provided the legal backing for the referendum.
