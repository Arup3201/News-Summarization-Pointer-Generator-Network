There may yet be a presidential campaign in the future for former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin.

Palin said in an interview with Fox Business Network today that she is invigorated rather than discouraged by her critics, and they make her 'want to get out there and defend the innocent, want to work so hard for justice in this country.'

'So, hey the more they're pouring on, the more I'm going to bug the crap out of them by being out there with a voice, with the message, hopefully running for office in the future, too,' Palin added.

Don't put dirt on her grave just yet: Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said today she hopes to run for office again

Palin built up goodwill among establishment Republicans when she joined Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts for a pancake breakfast last month at the Independence Historical Museum and Art Center. If Palin runs for president in 2016, she'll need the support of moderate Republicans like Roberts to win the GOP nomination

Palin decided not to seek the presidency in 2012 and she hasn't held elected office since she resigned as governor in 2009 during her first and only term. 

She remains a fixture of the Tea Party, however, and is generally billed as the keynote speaker at influential conservative conferences.

In March Palin told Fox News that she did have a campaign apparatus set up for 2016, but 'I'll never say never.'

If the GOP doesn't produce a candidate who is a 'fighter' and respects American exceptionalism, 'everything that makes America great, the promise of America then I would run,' Palin said. 

'But I do think that there are so many Americans who feel like I feel, and they're capable. They're willing and able to serve. Public servants. They are willing and able to serve and to lead this country so it doesn't have to be me,' she said back then.

In her interview today, Palin said Republican leaders 'need more guts' and have confidence in what the party stands for. She named Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah as 'good leaders' who don't back down.

Cruz is a likely 2016 presidential candidate but he has not formally announced his intentions to form a presidential exploratory committee. 

Given that neither Cruz, nor any other presumed GOP candidates have announced yet, Palin still has time to decide if she wants to join the 2016 rodeo, as well.

If she were to run she would surely have the backing Tea Partiers and hard right conservatives. 

She's also built up some good will among establishment types by campaigning for embattled Kansas Sen. Pat Roberts last month.

If Roberts, who is disliked by many conservatives, loses his reelection bid, Republicans may not take over the Senate.
