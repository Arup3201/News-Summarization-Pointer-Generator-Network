She's a glamorous mother of two with a stellar career and a happy marriage but even Holly Willoughby isn't immune to the pressure of juggling a working life with having a family.

Speaking during a panel discussion this week, the star revealed that making career and children work involves heroic amounts of planning, as well as a helping hand from her mother.

She also revealed that her inspiration for sticking with the day job after becoming a parent was none other than Great British Bake Off judge, Mary Berry.

Reduced hours: Holly works Monday to Thursday in order to spend more time with her young family

Talking about her role models, the presenter said: '[They are] my mum because she's amazing. Also Mary
Berry who I got to meet recently.

'She was one of the first women to 
have a family and fulfilling work life. She tried to strike a work/life 
balance at a time when it wasn't accepted.'

Berry has racked up a surprising number of celebrity fans, who, it was revealed earlier this week, include the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Prince William admitted that his pregnant wife was a 'huge fan' of the TV cook during a visit to the headquarters of charity, Child Bereavement UK, in Buckinghamshire. Berry is the charity's patron.

Speaking during a Marie Claire panel discussion, fellow Berry fan, Willougby, also spoke of how she manages her working week and revealed that she has been allowed to cut her hours down to four days a week.

She said: 'Every part of my day is planned. I'm lucky I can set my own ground rules. My kids can come to work if need be.

Royal approval: Willoughby isn't the only fan of Mary Berry. The Duchess of Cambridge also adores her

Discussion: The panel also included Marie Claire editor Trish Halpin, Rebecca Hopkins and Bec Clarke

'I work Monday to Thursday so that i have Fridays and the weekend as family time. [During the] four days [in the office], I work more efficiently than five - I force myself to. i realise how lucky I am.'

Willougby also described a typical working day, saying: 'My alarm clock or three-year-old is my 
6.30am wake up call.

'At 7am I read the briefs for the show that day in 
the car, then when I get to the studio it’s into hair and make-up.

'By my
first meeting I've felt like I've sat an exam on the subject. I finish 
at 1pm and then in the afternoon, I do a variety of different work such as 
working on my Very range.

'I make sure I finish at 5pm though so that 
I'm home for dinner and bath with the kids in the evenings.'

She also revealed that she, like many a working mother, likes to relax with a tipple once the children have gone to bed. 'I like to relax with a glass of wine a couple of times a week in the evening,' the presenter said.

The discussion, which took place as part of Marie Claire magazine's marieclaire@work initiative, focused on getting work life balance right, and also included Rebecca Hopkins founder of beauty brand Balance Me, Bec Clarke of jewellery brand Astley Clarke and Marie Claire editor-in-chief, Trish Halpin.
