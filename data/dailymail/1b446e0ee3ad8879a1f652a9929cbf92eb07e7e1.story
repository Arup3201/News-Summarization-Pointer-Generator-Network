Motorists in Boston who have been 'stealing' parking spaces shoveled clear by other people have returned to find their cars with tyres slashed and paint scratched. 

Across parts of the city, there is a certain etiquette involved in finding a parking spot which has developed since the 1970s. Visitors to the city are often baffled when they return to find their car damaged or covered in abusive notes. 

According to the blog, Caught in Southie, which covers the Wild-West area of winter parking, residents of the area block off 'their' part of the street with a 'space saver'. 

Motorists who use parking spaces cleared by others in Boston face the prospect of their car being damaged

Some of the unofficial space savers can be quite amusing such as this polite warning against parking

Other space savers explicitly threaten the person's car if they decided to steal the parking spot 

A space saver can be anything from a shovel, bucket, to an old sofa. According to the unofficial rules, someone has the right to save a parking space if they have shoveled out the snow. Their efforts grant them a 48-hour pass to hold the spot using their own space saver. 

Also according to the unofficial rules, the 'gentleman's' agreement is backed up with the threat of force. Anyone stealing another's parking space is likely to return to their car to find it with its tyres slashed or paint scratched.  

According to Caught in Southie: 'If you move someone’s space saver and park your car in its place, you have no right to complain about what happens to your car. However, you are allowed to retaliate as long as you don't get caught. If you get caught, you shouldn’t complain about the beating you will most likely receive.'

City authorities claim that all space savers must be removed from the street 48 hours after the snow emergency has ended.

People in Boston learn at an incredibly young age the need to protect your parking spot during winter 

Some Boston residents try to appeal to the better nature of their neighbors by saying they are a nurse 

Boston is probably the only city in the world where someone would use a lobster trap to mark a space

It is unlikely that the person who cleared this snow was mobility impaired as they would probably require the walking aides once they arrive at the other end of their journey, unless they had a third walking device 

However, South Boston, more commonly known as Southie, has banned the use of space savers, although the policy is being widely ignored. Cambridge has also outlawed their use.

During earlier snow emergencies one man shot out the tyres of a car that stole his spot with a nail gun.

Stephen Fox, co-chairman of the South End Forum, told The Boston Globe: 'This is a criminal act of vandalism. This is not a quaint Boston custom gone awry. This is something that is intolerable in an urban environment, and it needs to be treated as a crime and not with a shoulder shrug.

'You always hear the same arguments for them. "These people don’t bother to shovel out their spaces and then they come as interlopers and take my space I spent hours shoveling out." But the question they don’t answer is: "How did they get their car out in the first place?" They had to shovel to get their car out to go from point A to point B. The entire thing defies logic.'

Interesting question, but moving a space saver in Southie normally results in only one outcome 

This person escaped lightly after their wing mirror was defaced with an abusive message 

Under conventional wisdom, space savers are only supposed to be deployed AFTER the snow 

Some territorial people from Boston have been known to guard their parking spot in person

Not exactly the type of board that is normally used during a snow storm, but it serves a purpose 

This space is being marked out by the front bumper of a car, presumably a victim of the snow storm
