A man suffering from a mystery flesh-eating bug that has destroyed his oesophagus, and is so rare that only two other people in the world have it, is questioning how long he has left to live.

Russel Carter, 48, from Crawley, west Sussex, lost his windpipe from the rare bug and has no idea where it will strike next, fearing he is living on borrowed time.

The unnamed disease could possibly move to his vital organs, which would almost certainly kill him, and he is now reaching out to the only two sufferers of the disease in a bid to find help and answers.

Russel Carter is suffering from a mystery flesh-eating bug so rare that only two other people in the world are known to have it

The other two people who suffer the unidentified disease which destroyed Russel Carter's oesophagus live in Florida and North Korea, and Carter and his wife are desperately trying to reach them for answers

Carter, a father-of-two, fell ill four years ago, and has been struggling to speak ever since the bug attacked his throat.

His stomach was also affected, being halved in size because of the bug.

Because of the sickness he and his wife Cheryl moved their wedding date forward, because he was uncertain about his future.

Carter, first fell ill while working an airport baggage handler at Gatwick airport in 2010, developing sciatica and then pneumonia.

The doctor's initial diagnosis was a blood clot, prescribing him with warafin, which caused an undetected duodenal ulcer to burst.

This meant Carter's organs were flooded with blood, and he spent three months recovering in intensive care.

The operation following the flesh eating bug left Russel with no oesophagus and half a stomach, as the former was removed, and the latter stretched to reach his throat using pig skin

But disaster struck when weeks after his discharge, his oesophagus started to close up.

Doctors attempted to re-open the windpipe by using an inflated stent to widen it so he could eat and drink, but repeated closures meant this was repeated 27 times over the following year.

His oesophagus eventually became so weak it had to be removed, and eventually his lungs were flooded with water every time he drank a glass of water.

Pig skin was used to replace the destroyed oesophagus, by stretching his stomach to the top of his throat, halving its size and causing Carter to lose four stone.

After it was removed, tests on the oesophagus showed it had been affected by the unidentified flesh-eating virus, which was likened to fistula disease and cancer, with no cure or preventative treatment available.

After the surgery, Russel and Cheryl moved their wedding date forward so could celebrate it together, as Russel was deeply uncertain about his future with the bug

Carter keeps the pain at bay with tablets, but is aware that it could fatally resurge at any time.

Doctors admit they have no idea how long he will live for or if the disease can ever be cured.

Carter said: 'It leaves holes in my organs and the scariest thing is not knowing what is going to happen next. “I might just collapse right now or die at any time.

'Whether I am going to be in pain, whether it will be slow or quick. It’s very frustrating.

'This has made me value life a bit more. That’s why I wanted to get married.. I didn’t want to waste anymore time.

'At the minute I just have to take the tablets to manage it but it doesn’t cause me any pain.'

However, Carter is determined to carry on living as normal as possible because he fears he would give up if he stayed at home.

He added: 'I’m still in full time work. I can’t afford to just stay at home, being out and about keeps me going.

Russel, a father of two first experienced the disease when he was a baggage handler at Gatwick airport in 2010, and has been in a state of medical emergency ever since

'The doctors don’t have any solution to this at all. Nothing is happening with it.

'A few special treatments have been mentioned but they need a medical grant for it.

'I get told different things every time and I never know what they are going to say, it is very frustrating.'

Doctors at Guildford Hospital in Surrey where Russel is being treated say they have no option but to just manage the disease as it develops.

Dr Yuen Soon, a consultant oesophagogastric and laparoscopic surgeon, said it is impossible to eradicate the disease and he has been unable to contact any other people suffering from the condition.

A hospital spokesman said: 'The Trust is an international leader in surgical training and Mr Carter’s case can be used by Mr Soon’s team and other consultants as an educational tool.

'As Mr Carter’s case is extremely rare, with only two other people in the world also having the same condition, the Trust will continue to support and deliver a high quality of care to help manage and monitor Mr Carter’s disease.'

The other two men with the condition live in Florida and North Korea and Russel and wife Cheryl, 55, a security guard at Gatwick, are now trying to get in touch with them.
