Smiles: When Casey is released next week she will NOT be appearing on the Jerry Springer show as first reported

She was probably already spending the money in her head as she lay in her cell patiently waiting for her imminent release.

But it appears Casey Anthony needn't bother because she may not be 'cashing in' on the death of her daughter Caylee as much as was first predicted.

It was thought that the accused child murderer could have raked in millions of dollars from TV appearances, interviews, penning her memoirs, a movie about the tragedy and even a career in the porn industry.

And no sooner had she been acquitted on all counts except for lying to police than reports surfaced that the folks at Jerry Springer had offered Anthony, her parents and her brother $1million to appear on the show.

But now the show's publicist Gary Rosen has rubbished the claims, saying there was never such an offer and there never will be in the future.

According to reports, the $1million offer was made to Casey's defence team on Friday and that they said she was interested.

But Gary Rosen insisted to The Hollywood reporter: 'There is absolutely no truth to this story whatsoever. The Jerry Springer Show has not made any monetary offer to Casey Anthony and her family to appear on the programme, nor will we.'

Al Taylor, a freelancer who works for the show, said: 'The Springer show got immediate backlash after the news was leaked and so they decided they didn't want any part of it any more.'

Casey became one of the most vilified woman in America, condemned as a compulsive liar and heartless mother who murdered her daughter by suffocating her with duct tape.

Dumped: Defence attorney Jose Baez has been dropped by Paradigm talent agency only two days after he was signed up

New Friends: Casey Anthony has nowhere to go when she leaves jail but it is thought she may stay with Defense Counsel Cheney Mason and Dorothy Clay Sims

The Jerry Springer Show is world-famous for its controversial guests and gritty subject matters which often lead to friends or family members become involved in physical violence and verbal abuse as truths and secrets are revealed.

No access: Cindy Anthony tried to visit her daughter in jail yesterday but was snubbed

The Anthonys may have been perfect candidates for the show after Casey's defence team accused her father George of molesting her when she was a child and claimed she was too intimidated by him to report the accidental drowning of her daughter Caylee.

Mr Anthony was also accused of having extra-marital affairs behind his wife's back, while the prosecution also accused Casey - who has blamed numerous men for the paternity of Caylee - of sleeping around right after her daughter's death.

Anthony was sentenced to serve four years for the convictions of lying to law enforcement, but will be released later this month for time served and good behaviour.

Her defence attorney Jose Baez, who has enthusiastically courted the fame and publicity that the case has brought him, especially since the acquittal, has also had his dreams of a TV career shattered.

Talent agency Paradigm signed him on Thursday, two days after he and the rest of the defence team basked in the glory of their win at court.

But sources have now said that the agency has decided not to represent the controversial attorney despite announcing that it had signed him and would be handling him in areas including broadcasting, books, film and TV movie rights.

Sources within the agency did not provide a reason why Baez would not be represented there, but an email went around the agency Thursday night simply stating: 'We have informed Jose Baez tonight that we will not be representing him.'

Mystery: No one except the Anthony family will ever know what happened to little Caylee, whose death has outraged a nation

Meanwhile Casey Anthony rejected a jailhouse visit from her mother Cindy as her parents tried to speak to her for the first time on Friday since she was acquitted of killing her two-year-old daughter Caylee

Cindy Anthony made an appointment to visit her 25-year-old daughter at Orange County jail, Florida, at 7pm but Anthony refused to see her.

Mrs Anthony was due to go to the prison - where her daughter must spend another nine days after being found guilty of lying to police - without her husband George Anthony.

Anthonyâ€™s refusal to speak to her mother is the latest sign of how estranged she is from her parents. The snub has led to speculation of where Anthony will go when she is freed next Sunday.
