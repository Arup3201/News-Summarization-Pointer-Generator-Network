Former world darts champion John ‘Jocky’ Wilson was hailed as the ‘Braveheart’ of the game yesterday following his death at  the age of 62.

A star of the golden era of darts, famed for downing lager with vodka chasers during matches, he died at his home in Kirkcaldy, Fife, after a battle with lung disease.

Tommy Cox, who managed Wilson from 1988-1996, paid tribute to the man who helped lay the foundations of the modern game.

He said: ‘In the 1980s there wasn’t a person in the country who didn’t know who Jocky Wilson was.

‘Jocky transcended the whole spectrum 
of life in the UK. It’s a very sad day because Jocky was loved by so 
many people for the great character he was.’

English player and former rival Bobby 
George said Wilson was ‘the Braveheart of darts’.

He added: ‘He was 
Scottish through and through. When he played against England, it was 
great for the Scots.’

Wilson, who won world titles in 1982 
and 1989, founded a breakaway professional darts championship in the 
1990s which helped the sport shed its working-class image and attract a 
new generation of fans.

Prince Harry is known to enjoy the game and went to London’s Alexandra Palace last year for the World Darts Championship.

Phil ‘The Power’ Taylor, the 15-time 
world champion, said: ‘With the likes of Eric  Bristow and John Lowe, 
Jocky made the game what it is today.’

Wilson, born in Kirkcaldy, was to many, the quintessential darts player, playing with a cigarette in one hand and drinking.

He earned £500 for winning his first 
major competition when he was 29 and unemployed. By the end of that year
he was in the top eight in the world.

Such was his cult status that he 
famously made a ‘guest appearance’ on Top of the Pops in 1982 when Dexys
Midnight Runners performed Jackie Wilson Said in front of an image of 
the rotund darts player instead of the American soul singer of the 
song’s title.

Wilson retired suddenly from darts 
when he was 45. Leaving his home in Newcastle, he moved back to 
Kirkcaldy and into a one-bedroom council flat.

It is believed that he walked away from the game he loved after being diagnosed with diabetes, which stopped him from drinking during the games.

His former manager Cox said Wilson felt 'embarrassed' at having to drink water at tournaments.

He was declared bankrupt 
in 1998.

It is thought he spent the last 16 years of his life as a recluse, never even setting foot outside his home again.

He died two days after his 62nd birthday at the home he shared 
with his Argentinian wife Malvina. They had three children.

Darts commentator Sid Waddell said 
yesterday: ‘What can one say about the larger than life character that 
was John Thomas Wilson? Darts legend, working class hero and honorary 
Geordie.’
