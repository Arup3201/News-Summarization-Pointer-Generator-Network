The mother of the Oklahoma beheading suspect has appeared in a video online in which she apologizes to his alleged victims, but insists 'there are two sides to every story'.

Her son, Alton Alexander Nolen, is set to be charged tomorrow with first degree murder for the killing of Colleen Hufford, 54, at the Vaughan Foods Facility in Moore on Thursday.

Nolen will also face a charge of assault and battery with a deadly weapon for the stabbing of Traci Johnson, 43. 

In the clip posted on Facebook, Nolen's mother Joyce Nolen discusses her son with a sense of disbelief.

'My heart is just so heavy right now,' Joyce Nolen said in the video on Saturday. 'That's not my son.'

Nolen (right), is accused of killing Colleen Hufford, 54, and stabbing Traci Johnson, 43, (left) at the Vaughan Foods facility in Moore on Thursday. 'My heart is just so heavy right now,' Joyce Nolen said. 'That's not my son'

Sitting in a dimly lit room next to Megan Nolen, one of the suspect's sisters, she explains that her son was a 'good kid'.

'My son was raised up believing in God. That's what he believes,' she said. 

'That's not my son. There is two sides to every story and we are only hearing one.'

'His family, our hearts bleed right now because what they saying Alton has done,' she said. 'I want to apologize to both families — because this is not Alton.' 

Hufford, 54, who had been married for 25 years, had lost her family home in the Moore tornado

The mother also said she is praying that justice will prevail and 'the whole story will come out.' 

Megan Nolen insists her brother is a 'great person' who has never been violent and asks the viewers keep the Nolan family 'in their prayers.' 

The Oklahoman confirmed their identities Sunday with Paige Nolen, who also is a sister of the suspect.

Police Sgt. Jeremy Lewis said that Nolen will be charged Monday with first-degree murder and assault and battery with a deadly weapon and that he may also face federal charges. 

Police were waiting for Nolen to regain consciousness before charging him, according to Lewis.

Hufford, who had been married for 25 years, had lost her family home in the Moore tornado.

Her neighbours described her as 'quick to smile' and said her husband picked her up from the food processing plant every night and he was outside when he found out she had been killed.

Today it was revealed that Nolen had served less than two years of a six-year prison sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, reports News OK. 

According to records he went to prison March 10, 2011, to start a two-year sentence for marijuana possession and another two-year sentence for assaulting a highway patrol trooper, the website reported.

He began his six-year sentence for cocaine possession April 26, 2011, records show - due to plea agreements with prosecutors, he was allowed to serve the three prison sentences at the same time. 

He was released on March 22, 2013, records show.

'Our intent was to incarcerate him much longer than a year and 11 months,' Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater said Friday.

'This case perfectly illustrates the problem with the Department of Corrections.' 

'If it's not an 85 percent crime, we have no idea how long a person will actually spend in prison,' Prater said. 

An FBI investigation into the incident is still pending, and Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken told Fox News it is not known whether the act was one of terror.  

On Nolen's Facebook page, listed under the name Jah’Keem Yisrael, he posted photos of Osama bin Laden and Taliban fighters, along with posts condemning a variety of aspects of American life.

Posts ranged from religious iconography to stock photography to even photos of supposed UFO activity.

It also included a graphic photo of a beheading. 

In prayer: It has emerged that Nolen (seen praying) apparently celebrated terrorism, promoted Islam and disparaged non-Muslims in a series of posts on Facebook in the months leading up to the alleged killing

At work: Meanwhile, in another, he uploaded a photo of the Joker with a message criticising the 'wicked' U.S. for not helping the people of Gaza against Israel. Above, Nolen is pictured loading food onto a shelf at work

In custody: Over a one-year period, Nolen also apparently posted images of Osama bin Laden, deadly weaponry, a poster reading 'Islam will dominate the world' and children learning how to shoot guns

Islamic convert: Other posts saw Nolen reading the Koran, donning Muslim religious clothing (pictured), praying in a mosque and seemingly performing the one-figure salute of the Islamic State terror group

Meanwhile, a spokesman for an Oklahoma City Islamic group said Saturday that Nolen was a frequent worshiper at a mosque the group maintains and that he remembers the suspect as 'a little weird.'

'He was a nice, quiet, low-key guy,' said Saad Mohammed, director of information for the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City.

'He acted a little odd,' Mohammed said, though he added that Nolen's behavior never raised any 'red flags' since he began worshiping at one of the group's centers in May.

He also said that Nolen attended services where sermons were delivered against beheadings like those committed by Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, militants, reports CBS News. 

'In no way, shape or form did he represent Islam in this foolish act,' Mohammed said. 

Records show that Nolen has what appear to be religious tattoos, including one referencing Jesus and one in Arabic that means 'peace be with you.' 

Scene: On Friday, 911 calls revealed the panic of employees, with a caller telling the dispatcher: 'They're in the office, front office of the building. Yeah, we can hear a lot of screaming. Above, the scene at Vaughan Foods

Heroic: Mark Vaughan, pictured above, shot the suspect multiple times to put an end to his killing spree. Mr Vaughan is the former president of the company, left, and a reserve sheriff's deputy, rig

Lewis said Nolen was fired right before the attack, and that he then drove from the building that houses the company's human resources department to its main distribution center.

Once inside, he attacked 54-year-old Colleen Hufford with a knife in the center's administrative office area, eventually severing her head, according to police. 

Nolen then repeatedly stabbed 43-year-old Traci Johnson before Mark Vaughan, a reserve sheriff's deputy and the company's chief operating officer, shot him, police said.

Johnson was treated for her injuries at the University of Oklahoma Medical Center, where she was released Saturday, said Varina Shellman, clinical coordinator for the medical center.

Sadness: Workers stand in silence outside Vaughan Foods as they wait to leave following the grisly attack

Lewis said Johnson was also interviewed Saturday.

Police learned Nolen was fired for 'numerous reasons' involving 'personnel issues,' Lewis said, adding that he didn't know the specifics.

Police asked the FBI to help investigate Nolen after co-workers told investigators he had recently started trying to convert several employees to Islam. 

Lewis said police asked the FBI to look into Nolen's background because of the nature of the attack, which followed a series of high-profile videotaped beheadings by Islamic State militants. 

In a statement, FBI Special Agent in Charge James E. Finch said the motive for the attack had not been determined, but that there is no reason to believe there was a threat to anyone else.

'We don't have any reason to believe there is any danger to the area,' Lewis said.
