The owner of a Staffordshire Bull Terrier that ripped the head off another dog has admitted that the animal was dangerously out of control at the time.

David Savage, 44, threw the body of Elvis, a Pomeranian, under a car, after the attack, a court heard, as a four-year-old girl looked on.

David Savage, who has a previous conviction in 2006 for having a dog out of control, pleaded guilty to owning a dog dangerously out of control in a public place at Halton Magistrates’ Court, Cheshire, today. 

Admission: David Savage, left, pleaded guilty to having a dog dangerously out of control in public after his Staffordshire bull terrier ripped the head off a Pomeranian.

The dog, which is called George, bulled through a gate at a property belonging to Margaret Antell when it snatched Elvis in its jaws, tearing the pet’s head off in the attack last month.

The Pomeranian belonged to Mrs Antell's Daughter-in-law Gemma, who posted pictures of George taken in the aftermath of the attack on Twitter and Facebook in a bid to track down the owners.

The court heard Susan Campbell, a friend of Savage, was walking the dog and could not control it.

Prosecutor Catherine Whincup said: 'It was broad daylight, in front of members of the public including a small child.

'Thankfully no human was attacked because of this.'

She said that Savage, who has previously been subject to an Anti-Social Behaviour Order which he breached, did not try to stop his pet from killing Elvis.

Mrs Whincup added Mrs Antell has been left ‘extremely distressed’ by the incident.

Defending Savage, Gary Heaven said the dog had not shown violent tendencies before the attack.

He said: 'During the period it was in his possession there was no occasion it had displayed any traits whatsoever that suggested it was capable of violence, let alone that level of violence.

Accusation: Donna Clarke, the previous owner of dog George, told the court that the attack is out of character and must be down to the owner David Savage

'The reason he wasn’t holding the dog himself is that he suffers from severe back pain.

'He had taken medication that morning and it had caused his hands to tremble quite badly.

'He wanted the dog to get exercise but wasn’t capable of holding the leash.'

The prosecuton called for the five stone ‘athletic’ Staffordshire Bull Terrier, called George, should be destroyed.

Savage got the animal four months before the incident from a friend.

Magistrates say they will sentence him, and decide on the dog’s future, in a hearing next month.

They expressed concern for his lack of remorse and previous conviction for a similar offence.

A destruction order for the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and a ban on Savage from owning animals will be considered.

Meanwhile, Campbell, also 44, who is charged with having a dangerous dog out of control in public did not appear in court today.

She was arrested yesterday along with Savage, after both defendants failed to show up to an initial court hearing.

Campbell was granted bail last night by Cheshire Police.
