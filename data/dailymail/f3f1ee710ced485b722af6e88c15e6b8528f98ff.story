Tensions: The fight broke out between the families queuing for the Jolly Rocker pirate ship ride

A mass brawl broke out among  parents as they queued with their children for a pirate ship ride  at Legoland.

Police were called and two men were arrested after ‘all hell broke loose’ at the theme park.Onlookers claimed one father grabbed a metal pole to use as a weapon during the ten-minute altercation. Horrified children looked on as more adults from two families joined in the fight.

One shocked bystander said: ‘About ten people were involved – even some of the women flew off the ride trading punches, and both the families had kids with them.

‘You don’t expect to see things like this at Legoland. My ten-year-old son has never seen violence like it.’

Witnesses suggested lengthy queues for the Jolly Rocker pirate galleon ride might have caused tensions to boil over.

The families involved were thrown out of the theme park at Windsor in Berkshire and banned from returning after the incident at 4.15pm on Saturday.

The ride was closed for 20 minutes while the situation was brought under control. Thames Valley Police was called in. Two men, aged 29 and 30, were arrested on suspicion of a public order offence.

Each was given a fixed penalty notice, the force said.

'Violence': A fight erupted between families queuing for a ride at the Legoland amusement park in Windsor, Berkshire (seen in a file picture), on Saturday afternoon

A spokesman for Legoland said: ‘An altercation occurred between a family group and a male guest.
‘The group of males and their families were removed from the park and will receive a lifetime ban.’

But she said the incident had not amounted to a brawl and denied that women were trading punches.
‘The Legoland team controlled the incident,’ she added. ‘Police were not
called in to break up the fight. We called them to assist with the two 
gentlemen in question.’

The theme park said it would 
recommend that the troublemakers be barred from the other attractions 
owned by its parent company, UK Merlin Group Entertainments, including 
Thorpe Park, Alton Towers and the London Eye.
