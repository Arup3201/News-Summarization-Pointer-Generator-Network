If you're planning a January diet to shift the extra pounds piled on over Christmas, you had better make sure you can find time in your schedule.

A new survey has revealed that more than 50 per cent of British people are too busy to eat properly and instead rely on food eaten on the go.

As a result, healthy eating is made harder, with many relying on snacks and sandwiches to get through the day.

Too busy to diet: For many of us, lunch is nothing more than a sandwich at eaten at the desk

The research, conducted by the New York Bakery Company and reported in Cosmopolitan, also found that the traditional lunch hour is becoming a thing of the past, with 47 per cent of respondents too busy to do anything more than grab a sandwich at their desk.

Breakfast, said by nutritionists to be the healthiest meal of the day and essential for dieters, was also affected by busy schedules, with more than 40 per cent of those polled admitting to spending less than 10 minutes on getting a healthy start to the day.

Worse, nearly one in three combined breakfast and lunch, instead consuming a gut-busting brunch to compensate.

The brunch, revealed the survey, is usually eaten in less than 20 minutes by just under half of those surveyed.

A fifth of respondents said they skipped breakfast and lunch altogether, instead choosing to snack throughout the day.

Most of the snackers also revealed that their constant nibbling left them unable to face a proper supper.

In more bad news for our bellies, 16 per cent of those asked said that they regularly ate their supper after 8pm - just as the digestive system begins to slow down in preparation for sleep.

Londoners were particularly prone to late night dinners, with 14 per cent admitting to eating their final meal of the day after 9pm as a result of working late into the evening.

In Yorkshire meanwhile, midnight feasting - another belly-busting habit - proved popular, with 16 per cent of those surveyed in the county admitting to waking up for a snack during the night.
