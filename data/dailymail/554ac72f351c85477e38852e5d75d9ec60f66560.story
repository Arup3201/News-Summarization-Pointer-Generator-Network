The scenes which surrounded Serbia's abandoned Euro 2016 qualifier with Albania caused much shock and amazement to all those watching.

But it is by no means the first international encounter to be taken over by external elements, as Sportsmail looks back at 10 previous matches which turned into total chaos.

Serbia and Albania players brawl leading to the abandonment of their Euro 2016 qualifier in Belgrade

Senegal vs Ivory Coast (October 2012) 

Didier Drogba has scored a few crucial goals in his time, but none have sparked off carnage inside a ground more than his penalty for Ivory Cost at Senegal in an Africa Cup of Nations qualifier.

Ivory Coast's Kolo Toure is escorted by police off the field in Dakar during his country's Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Senegal. The match was abandoned after home fans went on a violent rampage

The Chelsea striker's spot-kick to put his side 2-0 up with 15 minutes to play led to home fans starting a riot, throwing everything they could on to the pitch as well as burning rubbish.

As Ivory Coast took to the pitch seeking some relative safety, the players were rushed off it by police escorts. The aftermath saw Senegal banned from the following year's competition.

Italy vs Serbia (October 2010)

It's amazing this Euro 2012 qualifier in Genoa even kicked off, let alone last seven minutes before being abandoned after Serbia fans threw flares on to the pitch and into the home crowd.

The game was already delayed by 40 minutes after the visiting supporters tried to break down barriers between them and the pitch leading to Serbia players having to try to calm their own fans, without much success.

The then-Italy boss Cesare Prandell claimed he 'had never seen anything like it.' The Italians were later awarded a 3-0 by UEFA.

Denmark vs Sweden (June 2007)

This heated Euro 2008 qualifier in Copenhagen came to a dramatic end in the 89th minute after referee Herbert Fandel abandoned the game following an attack by a Danish fan.

With Denmark coming back from 3-0 down to level 3-3, Christian Poulsen sparked off wild scenes after he was sent off for punching Markus Rosenberg, resulting in a penalty to Sweden.

Stewards were nowhere to be seen as the fan ran on to the pitch to attack the referee. But despite the intruder being pulled away quickly by Denmark players, Fandel stopped the game with Sweden later given a 3-0 win by UEFA. 

France vs Algeria (October 2001) 

This was the first time the two countries had met since the north Africans had gained independence from their European hosts in 1962 - and it being 'only a friendly' wasn't going to lower the tension.

Algerian fans hinted at things to come after they heavily booed ‘La Marseillaise’ before kick-off. For a while though, the game appeared to be meandering to a calm ending.

However with France 4-1 up in the 77th minute, ever-increasing numbers of Algerian fans took to the field with stewards powerless to restore order. After the players went off for their own safety,  it took the intervention from riot police to regain control.

Zimbabwe vs South Africa (July 2000) 

A 2002 World Cup qualifier in Harare was bought to a fatal end as a result of stampeding from the home crowd late in the second half.

After the visitors had gone 2-0 up, Delron Buckley’s celebrations provoked a reaction among the home fans, with players quickly forced off as the atmosphere grew in hostility.

This led to police firing tear gas in to the crowd that caused the situation to worsen, resulting in the stampedes which crushed 13 people to death.

Republic of Ireland vs England (February 1995) 

Given the history between the countries, this was never expected to be the friendliest of friendlies but nobody expected the chaos that erupted midway through the first half at Lansdowne Road. 

The warm-up fixture for Euro 96 was hostile from the off with both fans heavily booing each other’s national anthem before the game.

Republic of Ireland's clash with England was abandoned after 27 minutes due to crowd trouble

Shortly after David Kelly put Ireland 1-0 up, England fans began ripping up seats and throwing missiles. Referee Dick Jol abandoned the game before riot police intervened. Fifty people were injured on the night.

Egypt vs Algeria (November 1989)

Unlike many of the matches in this list, this game was actually completed as Egypt defeated Algeria 1-0 to qualify for the 1990 World Cup. 

But there was post-match chaos from the Algeria contingent. The players and staff were unhappy at the referee - who took eight minutes to leave the field.

Algeria fans turned their anger on to the VIP area while their player Lakhdar Belloumi bottled the Egypt team doctor - leaving him blind in one eye.

Brazil vs Chile (September 1989)

Chile had to win this 1990 World Cup qualifier to retain any hope of making it to Italy the following summer. Not long into the second half they looked doomed after going 1-0 down in Rio.

Then in an extraordinary incident, a flare thrown on the field caused Chile goalkeeper Roberto Rojas to go down with his head bloodied. This forced Chilean players to walk off and not return for fears of their safety.

It later emerged that the flare had not hit Rojas and he had caused his own injury with a razor blade in his glove. As a result Chile were banned by FIFA from the 1990 and 1994 World Cups.

England vs Scotland (June 1977)

Goals from Gordon McQueen and Kenny Dalglish sealed a famous 2-1 Home Nations tournament win for Scotland at Wembley, but it's the aftermath which lingers in the memory.

A goal post was smashed and torn down as a policeman tried to calm some of the thousands of Scottish fans running wild on the pitch at Wembley Stadium after Scotland's 2-1 defeat of England

Scotland fans invaded the pitch in huge numbers after the final whistle, ripping up the Wembley turf as well as famously breaking the crossbar.

To this day there are still many Scottish homes that will boast of having a small patch of turf from the famous win.

Peru vs Argentina (May 1964)

A horrific disaster which is one of the worst ever seen at a football match. Peru were in contention to qualify for the Olympics, but late on in this Lima clash the hosts saw an equaliser disallowed.

Two spectators from an unhappy home crowd invaded the pitch in protest, but after one was brutally beaten by police, fans retaliated by pelting them with missiles.

Police responded by letting off tear gas, but as fans raced for the locked exits an eventual crush led to the deaths of 328 of the 53,000 in attendance at the Estadio Nacional.
