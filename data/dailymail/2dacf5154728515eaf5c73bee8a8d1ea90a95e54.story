A wannabe thief has proved that crime doesn't pay, when trying to blow up an ATM in the Northern Territory only to be knocked flat on his back by the blast.

He's seen in the surveillance video standing near the ATM. There's no one else around at 3.45am and all appears normal but then he looks to his left, takes something out of his pocket, and then glances to his right.

Normal, that is, until he lights something which is unclear but what happens next catches the culprit completely by surprise. 

All appears normal here, except for the shirt over his face. The would-be bandit seems set to take money out of the ATM, the legitimate way

But then he lights something in his hand and places it on the ATM

The blast is a big one, lighting up the area and smashing the ATM into pieces

He places the explosive on the ATM but the force of the blast is so great - it throws him across the pavement.

Clearly stunned by the impact and perhaps dumbfounded by his massive fail, the man runs off like a scalded cat - without any cash and with pride severely dented.

NT Police told NT News that when they arrived they found the ATM had been completely destroyed.

The force of the explosion not only wrecks the ATM but also tosses the culprit into the air

The man crashes to the ground as the remaining fragments of the machine burn nearby

The arsonist lies on the ground, stunned, as he surveys the damage he has wrought

'The offender is described to be a male of Caucasian appearance, medium build and at the time of the incident he was wearing dark coloured knee length shorts, a dark T-shirt, a dark hat, thongs and wore a light coloured shirt over his face,' Detective Acting Senior Sergeant Day told the newspaper.

And it's not the first time, according to NT Police, that the bandit has struck. On this occasion he targeted the ANZ in Winnellie but is wanted for a similar attack on the nearby NAB ATM on Christmas Eve.

No time to waste, the culprit gets to his feet and turns away from the burning wreck of an ATM

Mission not accomplished, he runs off down the street, pride lost and no ill-gotten money in his pocket
