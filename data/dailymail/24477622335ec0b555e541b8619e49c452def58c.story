Manchester United are poised to splash out £80million to turn Louis van Gaal’s squad into Premier League contenders.

United have revived their interest in £50million-rated Real Madrid winger Angel di Maria, launched a bid for Sporting Lisbon defender Marcos Rojo and are keen on Ajax utility player Daley Blind. 

Executive vice chairman Ed Woodward was understood to be in Cardiff for the UEFA Super Cup between Real Madrid and Sevilla ahead of talks with Madrid for the Argentina international Di Maria, considered by United manager Van Gaal as one of the best wingers in the world.

Reunited? And the Dutchman also wants Daley Blind, who played under him at the World Cup

Mover: Van Gaal is hoping to splash the cash to turn United into contenders again

Madrid have already priced him out of a move to Paris Saint-Germain after demanding £50m, but United hope to strike a more reasonable deal.

Should they succeed it will be the third time of asking after former bosses Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes each tried to sign the 26-year-old.

Woodward missed Van Gaal’s first match at Old Trafford on Tuesday night where United beat Valencia 2-1 with under-pressure midfielder Marouane Fellaini scoring the late winner.

Wayne Rooney was named captain for the night, but blotted his copybook by slamming a first-half penalty against a post.

Ruffled: The midfield man could be given a chance at Old Trafford despite interest from Napoli

Meanwhile Di Maria’s Argentina team-mate Rojo refused to train at Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday and has asked to leave the club now United have declared their interest.

Southampton have already had a £9.5m offer rejected and, despite third party ownership involvement, United don’t envisage problems signing the versatile defender — although Sporting will play hard-ball and want closer to £18m.

Dutch international Blind is valued at £15m by Ajax, but has already admitted he was flattered by interest from United and Barcelona.

Although he has reservations about whether he is physically suited to the Premier League, Blind has unswerving faith in his former national coach Van Gaal. The new United boss is also willing to give Marouane Fellaini a chance to prove he can stake a claim for United’s holding midfield role.

Despite talks at the weekend between the two, Van Gaal has told the Belgian he will take a closer look at him before allowing the 26-year-old to leave Old Trafford.

Although Napoli have expressed an interest they want United to subsidise a loan rather than buy the player outright.
