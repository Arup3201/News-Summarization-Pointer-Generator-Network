A vice principal at a Southern California school for troubled youths has been arrested for investigation of 25 counts of child molestation.

San Diego police say 49-year-old Kettrell Berry was taken into custody on Friday after a lengthy investigation.

He was being held on $1.12million bail pending his arraignment in San Diego Superior Court on Tuesday.

Accused: Kettrell Berry, former vice principal of the San Diego Center for Children in Kearny Mesa, was taken into custody on Friday

Berry was supervisor at the San Diego Center for Children in Kearny Mesa for nine years until being fired several weeks ago.

A Sheriff’s Department jail booking log obtained by U-T San Diego indicates Berry was booked on child molestation charges including lewd and lascivious acts with a 14-or 15-year-old, oral copulation with a person under 16, and 20 charges of sex with a foreign object on a person under 16.

The chief executive of the school told the news outlet the accusations involve alleged contact between Berry and a female student.

David McCaslin said Berry was fired on April 19 for 'violation of organizational policies'.

Scene: The San Diego Center for Children is a non-profit school for those who have suffered abuse, trauma, or have mental health issues

Mr McCaslin said in a statement released to MSNBC: 'We are saddened by the breach of trust that has occurred. In the Center’s 125 years of service in San Diego we have been a lifeline for over 10,000 children.

'We took immediate action by contacting the San Diego Police Department and Child Protective Services and have been partnering with them throughout the investigation.

'The safety of our children is always our first priority and we are taking action to ensure their continued safety. We are committed to helping and protecting children and the action of one person will not deter us from providing the best possible care and hope for these children.'

The San Diego Center for Children is a non-profit school for those who have suffered abuse, trauma, or have mental health issues, according to the report.

The school has five locations in San Diego with about 70 children enrolled at its main campus.

According to the school's website, it offers 'mental health and academic services... including day treatment, outpatient counseling, a K-12th grade education in our accredited school, a residential treatment program, as well as foster care services.'
