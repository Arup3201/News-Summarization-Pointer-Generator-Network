Sportsmail's Matt Barlow has everything you need to know about Chelsea's new signing Mohamed Salah - dubbed the 'Egyptian Messi'

Chelsea have beaten Liverpool to land FC Basle's Mohamed Salah for £11million, according to Sportsmail sources in Switzerland.

Sportsmail revealed the Reds' interest in the Egypt forward and talks were
 reaching an advanced stage until Chelsea gazumped Brendan Rodgers' side on Wednesday.

With
 Juan Mata sealing his exit to Manchester United, the Blues have looked to
 replace the Spaniard with Salah, who impressed against them in the 
Champions League this season scoring in both of their group stage games,
 including the winner in Switzerland.

Salah's
 preference was understood to have been Liverpool, believing he will get 
more game time, but Chelsea's financial muscle - plus the persuasive powers of Jose Mourinho - have swung the deal.

Chelsea confirmed on their official website on Thursday afternoon: 'An agreement has been reached with FC Basel for the transfer of their 21-year-old attacking midfielder Mohamed Salah.

'The move is subject to the Egyptian international agreeing personal terms and completing a medical examination.'

Salah later tweeted: 'Mohamed Salah Officially in @chelseafc.'

While impressing in Europe, the forward has also scored 17 goals in 27 games for Egypt.

But he has struggled to find the net as often in Switzerland this season, scoring just four times in the league for Basle to go with those strikes against Chelsea.
