Tucked away in the south of Guangzhou city in China lives the largest group of Koalas found outside Australia, a 50-strong community spanning five generations.

Chimelong Wildlife Park has been breeding koalas in a programme that has been bolstered by 13 animals imported from Australia in 2006. There have been some startling successes, including the birth of a pair of rare koala twins in 2007.

But while the cuddly koalas draw in tourists from all over mainland China and the world, animal rights groups have repeatedly condemned the treatment and living conditions of animals inside the facility.

Among the 50-strong community is a pair of 'koala twins', only the second pair to have ever been born in captivity

Chimelong is the only zoo in China to house koalas. The twin koalas they bred are only the second set of twins ever to be born in captivity, with the last set being born more than 50 years ago.

Despite these impressive feats, animal rights groups have condemned the park for operating animal performance circuses.

One online petition against Chimelong includes 'Ban Animals in Chime-Long International Circus', which endeavours to 'save 400 animals from the largest circus in the world.' 

Circuses that feature animal stunts are popular across China, with activists warning thousands of animals are routinely beaten and abused to make the shows happen. 

Members of the animal conservation group Animals Asia have visited the park on numerous occasions to audit their treatment of animals, and have actively condemned their treatment of numerous animals.

According to a report from 2009, ‘The koalas are kept in small concrete enclosures containing a number of small trees. Some enclosures contain just one tree.’

David Neal, the director of Animals Asia, told Daily Mail Australia he has tried to speak with the park for a number of years, but has never received a response.

‘We condemn the use of animals in circus performances and the use of animals as photo props throughout China,' he said.

Mr Neil said the parks have been directed to cancel their animal performances.

‘Chimelong safari park is under the administration of the local forestry bureau, which released a notice to end performances and the associated animal cruelty in 2010.

‘We doubt however the forestry authorities were directed to take action, as we have seen little to on changes in the conditions of the park since 2010.'

'Change will only happen when the public demand it. At the moment the public are largely unaware of the welfare implications associated with the use of animals performances and the keeping  animals in substandard captive conditions,' he said.

'As awareness grows, the parks will improve to meet public expectations.'
