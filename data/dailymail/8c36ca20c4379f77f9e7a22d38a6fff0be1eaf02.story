A high school in North Carolina has cancelled a play its theater students were set to perform because the show has a 'sexually explicit' gay scene.

Maiden High School's principal called off the production of Almost, Maine because of the play's sexual overtones and innuendo - including a scene where two men declare their love for each other.

But the playwright behind the critically-acclaimed show has hit out at the school, saying his production is about 'love, not sexual love'.

Maiden High School, North Carolina, has cancelled its theater students' production of Almost, Maine because of a scene involving a gay couple

The six-minute scene that has upset Maiden High School's principal and local churches involves two men discussing bad dates they have been on.

The two men declare they have fallen in love which each other, fall to the ground and then the scene ends. There is no sexual contact between them.

The play's student director Connie Baker told the Hickory Record that her class had worked for two weeks to get permission to perform the show and had been rehearsing for a week before they were told they had to cancel.

She said they had already edited the script to make it appear as if the men were not about to have sex.

'We received approval from our principal and the school's superintendent to do this play. We also had to have every student's parent sign a permission slip before they could audition. We did this, auditioned everyone and started rehearsals,' Miss Baker said.

Playwright John Cariani said the play was about 'love, not sexual love', as he called for the school to reverse their decision

'Word had spread throughout the community that there were homosexual characters in our play. There were complaints from different churches and multiple parents of students.' 

The playwright behind the stage show, John Cariani, said he had contacted the school to try to find a solution but did not receive a reply.

Mr Cariani said: 'I believe the play is about love, not sexual love. The scene with the two young men has no reference to sex at all.

'I just think there is a solution other than cancelling the production. I’ve reached out to the teacher who applied for rights to the play, but I haven’t heard back.

'I don’t think the students should have to suffer. They had already purchased the play and started rehearsing for it.'

The students have launched a petition, calling on their school to reverse the decision. It has been signed by nearly 2,000 people in six days. 

Maiden High School principal Rob Bliss said: 'In regards to the request for students to perform the play Almost, Maine, careful review and consideration was given to the contents of this play. 

'The play contained sexually explicit overtones and multiple sexual innuendos that are not aligned with our mission and educational objectives.

'As principal of Maiden High School, I have an obligation to ensure that all material, including drama performances, are appropriate and educationally sound for students of all ages.

'Our faculty and staff are still in review of potential performances to be conducted by our students this fall. At this time no final decision has been made regarding whether and what drama performances are to be presented this fall.'

The school district’s superintendent Dan Brigman said the choice of play was up to individual principals.
