Attack: Miriam Margolyes blasted the English class system after become an Australian citizen

One of Britain’s most respected and enduring actresses launched a stinging attack on the English class system... and added insult to injury by becoming an Australian citizen.

BAFTA-winning star Miriam Margolyes criticised her native land for its lack of energy and optimism after a citizenship ceremony presided over by Australian prime minister Julia Gillard.

She said: 'I don’t like class distinction and there is far too much of that in England.

'There’s an energy here - an optimism, a vitality. I think England doesn’t have that any more. There’s an irony and not accepting bull**** and I love that, that straight-talking stuff.'

Miss Margolyes, 71, took a pledge of allegiance to Australia with 100 other people at a ceremony in Canberra on Saturday, which was Australia Day.

The actress, best known for playing Professor Sprout in the Harry Potter films between 2002 and 2011, has divided her life between homes in London and Robertson, New South Wales, for years as her partner, Heather, is Australian.

Mrs Gillard told the audience at her citizenship ceremony: 'This is your new country, and you’ll never want another. Welcome to citizenship. Welcome to Australia. Welcome home.'

Miss Margolyes, who was awarded an OBE for services to drama in 2001, will also keep her British citizenship.

Explaining her decision to seek dual nationality, she said: 'My partner of 44 years is Australian and she is the main reason for becoming Australian - because I want to be closer to her.

'We met in 1968 in London when she was on a research trip to London. Being in Australia makes me happy, my partner is Australian and my home is in Australia and it’s ridiculous not to be Australian - it’s a logical step to take.

'I think I should be described as 'bi'- not bisexual because I’m not - I’m gay - but 'binational' because I retain British nationality and I add to it being Australian, which is like having your cake and eating it.'

Despite her attack on the British class system, Miss Margolyes said she still considers herself to be British as well as Australian because of her English accent.

She said: 'I am not the sort of person who divests myself of everything that came before I came to Australia.

'I want to take all the knowledge and experiences I gained when I was in England and put it at the service of Australia, because I have to bring something to Australia, not just money but myself.

'It would be absurd to say I’m not British - you can hear it when I speak.'

Born in Oxford, Miss Margolyes started her acting career in the 1962 Cambridge Footlights comedy group alongside future Monty Python stars John Cleese and Graham Chapman.

She won the BAFTA for best supporting actress for the 1993 Martin Scorsese film The Age of Innocence.

In 2008, she revealed her anguish that revealing she was gay led to her mother having a severe stroke, saying: 'I spoke to her about an affair with a woman and three days later she had this stroke.

'I realised it was a mistake on my behalf. It was an indulgence of me to tell her that.'
