The cafe owner who refused to give a barista a job because customers would not want 'coffee made by black people' appears to have closed his shop following a boycott.

As first reported by the Daily Mail Australia, Steven Hu, the owner of the Forbes and Burton cafe in Darlinghurst in inner city Sydney, made the remarks more than a week ago  to Brazilian-born Australian Nilson Dos Santos, 39.

The cafe has since been the subject of a widespread customer boycott as well as egging and flour bomb attacks.

The coffee shop was packed with lunchtime customers the day the owner denied Mr Do Santos a job on the basis of his skin colour. But there was no one inside the cornerside store on Tuesday morning.

Empty: A lone pot plant sat the door the deserted Forbes and Burton cafe in Darlinghurst when the Daily Mail Australia visited on Tuesday.

The racially-charged incident involving Brazillian-born barista Nilson Dos Santos, left, and cafe owner Steven Hu, right, has sparked international headlines.

Deserted: There was no sign of life inside the inner-city cafe that was the scene of the alleged racist incident the Sunday before last. Pink chairs that served as part of the cafe's outdoor setting, lower left, have been moved inside.

Closed for business: A pot plant sat on the front step of the once-bustling breakfast and lunch location this morning. Unintelligible grafitti was also scrawled across the concrete out the front.

The lights were off, a lone pot plant sat on the doorstep and the cafe's outdoor setting had been stacked inside.

Mr Hu told Daily Mail Australia: 'I won't say anything, sorry,' and hung up. Calls to the business's landline were not returned.

The coffee shop's apparent closure comes after many customers pledged to take their business elsewhere.

Stunned customers walked out of the store on the day of the incident after Mr Dos Santos announced what Mr Hu had said to him.

In the days since many users have posted on the cafe's Facebook page committing to a boycott.

One punter, Michelle Cavanagh, wrote: 'After what I've just read about a Brazilian barista being told he couldn't have a job because he was black don't expect me to ever Grace your doors.'

One-time patron Sonia Cattley said she would no longer buy her coffee there. 'I have been a regular here on the way to work....you will now be seeing me pass with a coffee from another store in my hand...absolutely disgusted.'

They were joined by Viet Anh, who remarked that there were many alternative cafes nearby. 'I say definitely all people should avoid this cafe because in Darlinghurst there are no shortage of cafes.'

A popular meme has also been circulated saying 'Boycott Forbes and Burton... #UnAustralian #NoRacism'.

Some customers said Mr Hu could rectify the situation with an apology, and perhaps a job offer. Rachel Frere said: 'Please offer the brazilian man the job and Ill come for a coffee.'

Vincent Mok added: 'Mr Hu, would you retract your comments about Mr Dos Santos, hire him, be on good terms with him and others, sincerely apologise to the world and move on? It is never too late to say sorry.'

The once-popular cafe appeared to have been egged at the weekend, according to these images that were posted on social media.

'Hope your shop burns down': One of many messages left on the cafe's Facebook wall as of Tuesday morning.

No staff, customers or cafe owner Steven Hu, left, were present at the Forbes and Burton cafe in Darlinghurst when the Daily Mail Australia visited on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Mr Dos Santos said last week that he has received more than 20 job offers.

Some comments crossed the line. 'Hope your cafe burns down,' said one recent post.

While the cafe's fortunes have gone downhill, Mr Dos Santos was deluged with more than 20 job offers in the aftermath of the incident.

He told Daily Mail Australia immediately following the incident: ‘I have never experienced anything like that in Australia,’ he said.

‘I love it here, I am free here, that’s why I chose to stay. I’ve always felt welcomed and accepted. For me, it was never a problem that I am black until today.

Mr Hu admitted making the remarks at the time.

'There are a lot of white customers at the café and I think the clients here want local people, not African people,' he said at the time.

'We need to offer good service at this café and I think the coffee culture is more about white people.

The Fair Work Ombudsman is continuing to investigate the matter.

Local police said they had not received any complaints from the cafe's owner.
