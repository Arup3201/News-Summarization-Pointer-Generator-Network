Pete Evans has been slammed by medical professionals for promoting fluoride-free water

Pete Evans has been accused of expressing views that date back to the 'Stone Age' after the celebrity chef threw his weight behind a campaign on fluoride-free water. 

Not a stranger to controversy, the My Kitchen Rules judge has come under fire yet again for what some have perceived as extreme dietary views after revealing that his family steers clear of consuming Australian tap water.

Evans' remarks have enraged medical professionals who have described his standpoint as misinformed and a potentially dangerous lifestyle choice.

Evans proudly adorns a 'Fluoride Free WA' t-shirt on Facebook to promote the Perth-based lobby group's cause. 

'Alkalised water (maybe I just should've just said filtered water?) - we have a portable mineral pot ($500) water filter which rids tap water from potential carcinogens (chorine, chemicals, bacteria etc),' he said in a post on his Facebook page. 

'I realise there's plenty of controversy around alkalised water, but I would rather choose this option over drinking tap water or bottled water, as it works out cheaper in the long run, and is environmentally friendly.'

Australian Medical Association Victorian president Tony Bartone hit back at the outspoken chef telling Daily Mail Australia that Evans needed to stick to what he does best.

'All evidence at this stage both reliable studies and research from universities, the World Health Organisation, and by the Australian Dental Association points to the fact that basically fluoridation is an important public health initiative - it does prevent tooth decay,' Dr Bartone said.

'Celebrity chefs should stick to their knitting and stay out of the debate - his comments belong back in the Stone Age.'

'People like this are using their fame and influence in areas that they have no expertise - obviously a top class chef but when it comes to scientific research and understanding - they are lacking.'

Evans has previously been slammed for his endorsement of the controversial Paleo diet, which his family abides by, that includes meat, fish, vegetables, and fruit but excludes dairy or cereal products and processed food.

'I'm occasionally ridiculed or accused of ignorance because I choose to eat and feed my family what I believe to be a nutrient dense diet,' he said on his Facebook page.

'I can't help but find it so bizarre as to why some people find my food choices so offensive?'

He says his decisions are an important part of being a parent - adding that 'ignorance is not bliss'.

'I'm a father and I take that privilege very seriously, so for me striving for optimum health and trying new things whenever possible, so that I can be a responsible role model for my daughters and still be able to surf right up until the end, is the ultimate goal,' he posted.

However, Dr Bartone sees Evans' stance as abusing his high profile media personality.

'It is influencing vulnerable others - people who are time-poor - and will unfortunately just look at celebrity endorsement and think it must be good and follow the argument without delving into the facts, he said. 

'It affects the health message we are trying to impart on our patients and the community at large - especially in times when know that health and well-being is crucial and key to a number of illnesses and health factors that have a huge cross burden on society.' 

This comes as Byron Shire Council's ban on fluoride in water has seen children by the age of six in the northern NSW coast area have almost three times as many decayed teeth as other parts of state where fluoride has been in the water for decades.

Evans has also been under fire for endorsing the Paleo diet which doesn't allow dairy or cereal and processed products

Dr Bartone said the fear that people in the community express is that excess fluoride intake will cause damage which he says is not possible through water consumption. 

'It's a theoretical argument that has unsubstantiated evidence - it just wouldn't happen,' he said.

'If some people purchased fluoride tablets that is probably one really unlikely way but possible way in which you get excess fluoride.' 

Dr Bartone said taking excess fluoride can cause damage to kidneys and other organs and possibly lead to weakening of the bones.

Daily Mail Australia contacted Evans for comment but had not heard back before publication.
