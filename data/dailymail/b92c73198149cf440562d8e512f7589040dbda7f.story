New York Citi Bike riders are at risk according to a new audit exposing spotty maintenance checks, poor cleanliness and defective docking stations.

Comptroller Scott Stringer released his report Thursday looking at if New York City Bike Share, which manages the scheme, is in compliance with its Department of Transport contract.

According to maintenance data, only 28per cent of the 6,000 two-wheelers in Manhattan and Brooklyn were inspected in November 2013, 34per cent in December 2013 and 38per cent in January 2014.

'With every missed maintenance check, the safety risk of undisclosed bike defects increases,' Stringer said.

Common defects were said to include missing or broken seats and pedals, flat tires and damaged wheel rims.

Of the 29 docking stations sampled in February 2013, the audit showed that only 11 were inspected as required and the remaining 18 were inspected less than twice a week or not at all.

And while the contract requires a response to cleanliness complaints within 48 hours for stations, and 96 hours for bikes, the audit found only 60per cent of the sampled complaints for stations were completed within the required time frame. 

Of the bike cleanliness complaints, 83per cent remained open for an average of 79 days.

In addition to problems with maintenance, cleanliness and docking stations, the audit  found stations with disconnected credit-card machines.

The accompanying mobile application was also revealed to be unreliable, and in many cases did not reflect the actual number of physically available bikes and open docks. 

As of last August, Citi Bike riders took about 34,000 rides per day, making the program what Stringer calls a 'critical component of our transportation network.' 

Shoddy maintenance: According to data, only 28per cent of the 6,000 two-wheelers in Manhattan and Brooklyn were inspected in November 2013, 34per cent in December 2013 and 38per cent in January 2014

However, the comptroller said improvements must be made to comply with the New York City Department of Transportation.

'New York City Bike Share's management of Citi Bike left too many New Yorkers in the lurch,' Stringer said. 

'While Citi Bike has become part of our urban landscape, auditors found that the bike sharing program's spotty maintenance, poorly-cleaned bikes and substandard docking stations inconvenienced riders and discouraged growth in the system.'

The private program is named for Citigroup, which spent $41 million to be its lead sponsor.

The Bikeshare Holdings company recently announced its plan to purchase Alta Bicycle Share, the parent company of New York City Bike Share - promising an infusion of capital for improvements. 

In addition, plans are in the works to expand the City Bike system.

New York City Bike Share cited worker layoffs and staffing issues to explain many of the problems exposed in Stringer's audit. The investigation ran from May 27 2013 through May 31 2014.
