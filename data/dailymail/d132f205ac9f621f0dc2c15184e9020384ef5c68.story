They were first to see the future king baby George, have their own coat of arms and have been known to travel to Cheltenham in a carriage in procession with the Queen.

So perhaps it's no surprise that the Middleton family appears to have been invited to join the royals’ VIP lease scheme with luxury car brand Range Rover.

The Duchess of Cambridge’s mother Carole, brother James and sister Pippa are reported to have all been given top-of-the-range 4x4s at heavily discounted lease rates in return for acting as unofficial ambassadors for the company.

The news may well re-fuel accusations that the Middleton family is ‘cashing in’ on their daughter’s royal connections.

Soon after it was announced that Kate was pregnant, Carole and Michael Middleton started to promote a range of baby goods on their party supplies website.

The ‘Little Prince’ and ‘Little Princess’ packs included paper plates decorated with a pink or blue crown and the words ‘a new little prince’ or ‘a new little princess’.

Before this, Party Pieces - which Mrs Middleton started by making party bags around her kitchen table - offered paraphernalia themed around the Royal Wedding and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

Certain members of the Royal family are known to benefit from similar car lease schemes, where they pay a reduced fee in return for their custom.

Last year it emerged that there was such
 an arrangement with German car manufacturer Audi, which is understood 
to have offered up to 60 per cent discount on their cars.

However, Range Rover now appear to have replaced their car of choice, with Prince William famously opting for a £140,000 model to drive Kate and their baby son George home from hospital.

More recently, the Queen was seen driving around her Balmoral Scottish estate in one and the Duke of Edinburgh on a grouse shoot.

Last month, James Middleton was seen driving his family in a brand new model to Prince George’s christening.

Car companies fiercely guard the privacy of their customers and what rates they pay, but according to the Mail on Sunday, the Middletons have been leased their very own top models in exchange for reduced rates.

A source said: ‘The Middletons’ Range Rovers have been leased to them as part of the VIP scheme.

'The idea is that you pay a small percentage of the usual fee in return for certain services - which can be as little as being seen driving around in the vehicle. Being associated with royalty does wonders for the brand.’

Exclusive lease schemes, which normally include services such as having cars personally delivered, have attracted criticism in the past for signing up celebrities who essentially advertise their cars by tweeting and writing blogs about them.

A spokesman for Range Rover said: ‘We do not comment on our relationship with any of our customers.’ The Middleton family was not available for comment.
