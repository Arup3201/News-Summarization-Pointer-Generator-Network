Ravel Morrison has agreed to join Lazio in the summer on a free transfer.

The West Ham midfielder's deal expires at the end of the season and he has agreed a contract with the Serie A side, although it has yet to be signed.

The troubled 21-year-old has been in dispute with West Ham and has spent time in previous seasons at Birmingham and QPR. 

Ravel Morrison's only Premier League appearance for West Ham this season was in August

Goals: 14

This season he joined Cardiff on a three-month loan but returned early in December. Other Premier League club have also enquired but Lazio now looks to be his next club of choice. 

He began his career at Manchester United, but was let go on a free transfer after Sir Alex Ferguson decided to wipe his hands of him.

From there, he joined West Ham but has been unable to cement a first-team spot.
