Republican presidential candidate 
Michele Bachmann is probably already growing tired with the Tea Party 
comparisons to Sarah Palin.

But
it seems she is already following in Mrs Palin’s footsteps of making 
unfortunate public gaffes after pulling a clanger in a television 
interview.

Mrs Bachmann, 
55, said she would work in the 'spirit of John Wayne from Waterloo' - 
who is not the actor, but the serial killer John Wayne Gacy.

Oops: Michelle Bachmann, 55, said she would work in the spirit of John Wayne - but the John Wayne from her home town is the serial killer John Wayne Gacy

She used her home town of Waterloo, 
Iowa, to launch her official campaign to become the Republican 
presidential candidate in the 2012 election.

‘Well
what I want them to know is just like, John Wayne was from Waterloo, 
Iowa. That's the kind of spirit that I have too,’ she told Fox News.

The
actor John Wayne, born Marion Morrison, was from Winterset, which is 
still in Iowa - but around 150 miles away from Waterloo.

John
Wayne Gacy, also known as the 'Killer Clown', was executed in 1994 for 
raping and murdering more than 30 boys and young men.

Gacy was born in Chicago, Illinois, 
before moving to Waterloo, where he lived for a short time and also had 
his first criminal conviction.

It was for an attempted homosexual assault and it landed him in prison for 18 months, reported The Washington Times.

He
then moved back to Iliinois and began his six-year killing spree 
between 1972 and 1978 before being later convicted and sentenced to 
death.

'We cannot afford four more years of Barack Obama. Make no mistake about it, Barack Obama will be a one-term president. Mr President, your policies haven't worked (and) spending our way out of the recession hasn't worked'

Mrs Bachmann's team 
have since tried to clear up what she meant, saying that John Wayne's 
parents lived in Waterloo, although their son did not.

They moved to Winterset before he was born, reported ABC.

The outspoken Tea Party favourite also tore into President Obama as she sought to capitalise on
soaring poll ratings and cast herself as the 'bold choice' for a 
Republican President.

After a week of winning right-wing praise for hardline opinions on subjects from energy-saving light bulbs to gay marriage, the Minnesota congresswoman told supporters: 'We can't afford four more years of 
Barack Obama'.

The 
55-year-old was in her native Iowa to launch an official bid, with 
surprise polls predicting her as a force in the state that opens the GOP
nomination contest, putting her well ahead with Mitt Romney.

Outside
a historic mansion in Waterloo, Mrs Bachmann said she is waging her 
campaign 'not for vanity', but because voters 'must make a bold choice 
if we are to secure the promise of the future'.

'We can't afford four more years of 
Barack Obama,' she said. '(He) will be a one-term president. Mr 
President, your policies haven't worked (and) spending our way out of 
the recession hasn't worked.

'We cannot afford four more years of 
millions of Americans who are out of work and are not making enough in 
wages to support a family.

'We can't afford the unconstitutional health care law that costs so much and delivers so little.

'The
liberals, and to be clear I am not one of those, want you to believe 
the Tea Party movement is just the right wing of the Republican Party. 
Nothing could be further from the truth.

'Our
problems don't have an identity of party, they are problems that were 
created by both parties. Americans aren't interested in affiliation, 
they're interested in solutions.'

Meanwhile,
her amped-up looks and wardrobe choices are causing a stir in the 
fashion world, with a carefully-considered pale grey dress and matching 
jacket outfit seen as tasteful and understated.

After the formal Iowa kick-off, she 
plans to shift her focus to New Hampshire and South Carolina - other 
states with traditions of separating the viable contenders from the 
political also-rans.

Mrs Bachmann’s
hardline approach to issues such as gay marriage has already seen her 
declare she would issue a constitutional amendment to make marriage 
between a man and a woman only.

Her ideologies have earned her a loyal 
following but also plenty of guff from those who see her as a fringe 
politician - and many analysts say she has a me-against-the-world view 
of politics.

‘Her trick is going to be to maintain that boldness and to somehow reign it in and discipline it so it works for her and not against her,’ GOP pollster Mike McKenna said.

‘She's a hell of a lot closer to where the party is right now than where (the other candidates are).’

So to shore up her campaign she has recruited aides in Iowa and New Hampshire who worked on the campaigns of previous presidential hopefuls Mike Huckabee and John McCain.

She insists her combative style will 
give her something different to her measured rivals such as governors 
Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty and Jon Huntsman and former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich.

Audience: Bachmann, who was born in Waterloo, Iowa, will continue her announcement tour this week with stops in New Hampshire and South Carolina

Applause: Michele Bachmann, pictured right with her husband Marcus, enjoyed a rapturous reception

‘I've been consistent, nothing but 
consistent,’ Mrs Bachmann said. ‘I don't say things for political value.
I'm authentic in what I say.’

Other candidates are ex-Senator Rick 
Santorum, Texas Rep. Ron Paul and businessman Herman Cain. Texas 
Governor Rick Perry and 2008 vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin could
also join.

Mrs Bachmann 
has risen to fame by trying to block and now promising to repeal 
President Obama's healthcare law - as well as saying GOP House leaders 
are too timid on federal spending cuts.

She
also believes in more abortion restrictions and constitutional 
amendments to ban gay marriage, as well as having a strong belief in 
family values after raising five children and 23 foster kids.

However
she can be fierce, accusing President Barack Obama of pushing the 
country towards socialism - and is known by her opponents to be 
unwilling to budge on her views, even in tough races.

‘She's not a manoeuverer. At the end of 
the day she is going to distinguish herself by going out there and 
trying to draw people to her,’ said David Strom, a Republican involved 
in Minnesota politics.

Opinions: Mrs Bachmann has a hardline approach to issues such as energy-saving lightbulbs and gay marriage

Democrat Elwyn Tinklenberg, who lost to 
her in a 2008 congressional race, said he was frustrated that the more 
controversial Mrs Bachmann came off, the stronger she seemed to get.

‘She can say something that's just outrageous and just completely wrong and move on and never skip a beat'

Her comments often fuel a fundraising machine that netted her $13.5 million for her last election.

‘She can say something that's just outrageous and just completely wrong and move on and never skip a beat,’ Mr Tinklenberg said.

Tea Party members are seeking purity from the GOP candidates and have reacted sceptically to those largely linked to the party power brokers, particularly Mr Romney.

But she has already provoked the fury of green campaigners after joining with senior Republicans in vowing to repeal a law on energy-saving light bulbs because they believe it breaches human rights.

The 2007 law, which is set from January to introduce energy efficiency standards for light bulbs, is being contested by more than a dozen right-wing politicians, including Mrs Bachmann.

Tender moment: Mrs Bachmann has been married to Marcus for 33 years and they have five children

Big support: Mrs Bachmann has risen to fame by trying to block and now promising to repeal President Obama's healthcare law - as well as saying GOP House leaders are too timid on federal spending cuts

'The government has no business telling an individual what kind of light bulb to buy,' Mrs Bachmann said while introducing her 'Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act' earlier this year.

Mrs Bachmann hit back after Chris Wallace asked her on Fox News if she is a 'flake'.

'I think that would be insulting to say something like that because I'm a serious person,' she said. 'I'm 55 years old.

'I've been married 33 years. I'm not only a lawyer, I have a post-doctorate degree in federal tax law from William and Mary.

'I've worked in serious scholarship, my husband and I have raised five kids, we've raised 23 foster children.

'We've applied ourselves to education reform. We started a charter school for at-risk kids. I've also been a state senator and member of the United States Congress for five years.'

Mr Wallace has since admitted he 'messed up' with the question and 'didn't mean any disrespect'.

She added at a party gathering in June: 'President Bachmann will allow you to buy any light bulb you want in the United States of America.'

Mrs Bachmann has also come out against gay marriage as a new same-sex law was approved in New York, but also said it was up to individual states to decide whether they allowed it.

'Every time it's going on the ballot, the people have decided to keep the traditional definition,' she said. 'After all, the family is the fundamental unit of government.'

Mrs Bachmann has also said 'scare tactics' are being used by those warning of an economic calamity unless Congress raises the government's borrowing limit by an August deadline.

She claimed the U.S. could avoid a default by paying only the interest on U.S. obligations while lawmakers work on a deal to cut spending dramatically as part of a new debt ceiling.

In an Iowa poll of GOP candidates conducted for The Des Moines Register, former Massachusetts governor Romney is ahead with support from 23 per cent - but Mrs Bachmann is close on 22 per cent.
