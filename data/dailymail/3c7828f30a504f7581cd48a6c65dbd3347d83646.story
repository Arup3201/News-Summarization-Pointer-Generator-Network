British number three Johanna Konta reached the second round of qualifying at the French Open with a comfortable win over American teenager Sachia Vickery in Paris.

The pair were held up by rain but, when they did take to the court at Roland Garros, fourth seed Konta was in dominant form against her 19-year-old opponent, winning 6-2, 6-3.

Konta, 23, is at a career-high ranking of 102 and needs to win two more matches to reach the main draw for the first time at the French Open.

In control: Johanna Konta cruised through to the second round of qualifying in straight sets

She qualified at the US Open in 2012, and made her debut in Paris last year but fell in the second round of qualifying.

Heather Watson, who reclaimed the British number two spot from Konta and climbed back into the top 100 on Monday after winning a title in Prague, was due to play her first qualifying match on Wednesday against Irina Falcon, but rain has forced it to be postponed until Thursday.

James Ward's second-round match against another American, Ryan Harrison was also cancelled for the day.

Patient wait: Heather Watson will have to wait until Thursday to open her qualifying campaign

Cancelled: James Ward's second-round qualifying match against Ryan Harrison was also postponed
