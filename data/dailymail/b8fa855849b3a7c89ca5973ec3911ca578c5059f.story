Britain faces a legal challenge over its alleged role in supplying information to an American  military ‘kill list’ in Afghanistan.

Targeting Taliban leaders and drug traffickers plays a key role in Nato’s strategy in Afghanistan.

The existence of the ‘kill list’ was first revealed in a US Senate report in 2009 detailing a new task force linking US and British military with the Drug Enforcement Agency and Britain’s Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca).

An Afghan man who lost five relatives in a missile strike has started proceedings against the Soca and the Ministry of Defence, demanding to know the UK’s involvement in the target list.

Solicitors Leigh Day & Co have asked Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Soca to provide assurances about Britain’s participation, and whether it complies with UK and international law.

Kabul bank worker Habib Rahman lost two brothers, two uncles and his father-in-law in a missile attack on their cars in  September 2010.

He launched the legal challenge because 
he believes his relatives were unlawfully killed in a case of mistaken 
identity during one ‘kill list’ operation.

At the time of the attack, the Inter-national Security Assistance Forces said it was a ‘precision air strike’ which killed ‘eight to 12 insurgents’, including a  Taliban commander.

Mr Rahman says the deadly strike happened while they were helping a cousin who was campaigning in the run-up to Afghanistan’s elections. Leigh Day & Co acknowledge they do not know whether information provided by the UK contributed to the attack but say they hope the legal challenge will force officials to be more open about the British contribution to the ‘kill list’.

Rosa Curling, from Leigh Day & Co, said: ‘At a time when the UK Government is arguing that our presence in Afghanistan is needed to bring stability to the country and to establish and maintain the rule of law, ensuring that the UK Government and its agencies themselves are operating within their legal obligations could not be more important.

‘Our client’s case suggests that the establishment and maintenance of the “killing list” is not in line with the UK’s duties under international humanitarian law.

‘Our client lost five of his relatives in an attack by the international military forces as a result of this list.

‘It is important that the MoD and Soca provide us with the reassurances sought, to make sure that others do not suffer the tragic loss of life as experienced by Mr Rahman.’

The MoD said it could not discuss the case in detail but stressed it worked ‘strictly within the bounds of international law’. A Soca spokesman said: ‘Soca does not discuss intelligence. Soca works strictly within the bounds of international law.’

■ Three US special forces soldiers were shot and killed by a follower of the Taliban dressed in an Afghan uniform after he lured them to a breakfast meeting yesterday in the Sangin district of Helmand province. 

A fourth man was injured in the attack, the latest in a series by Afghan soldiers or police who are supposedly taking over responsibility for security once Nato forces go in 2014.

The Taliban claimed the killer – who invited the soldiers to his checkpoint for  a pre-dawn Ramadan meal – had been  helping US forces to train police, but was now working for them.
