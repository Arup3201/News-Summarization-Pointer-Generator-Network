New Barcelona coach Luis Enrique warned that the wind of change would soon be blowing through the club as they try to make up for their worst season in seven years.

'Players need to know that at Barcelona things move on. We have to be as competitive as we possibly can and there could be changes in all parts of the team,' said the 44-year-old coach.

He refused to rule out signing a more conventional centre forward after years of Lionel Messi operating as the club’s ‘false 9’ and said he would speak to Barca’s four-time Ballon d’Or winner after the World Cup.

'I am delighted to have the best player in the world at my disposal. He’s just signed a new contract and he has said he wants to stay for life.

'It’s true his level this season has not been as incredible as other seasons but only by the standards he has set. We will work to get the best out of him with Andres Iniesta and with Neymar and with the young players coming through.'

There was no mention of Pedro and Alexis Sanchez and he sidestepped a question over whether Cesc Fabregas would be considered ‘untransferable’. All three are understood to be on a list of players the club are open to listening to offers for.

Asked about captain Xavi he said: 'He is a friend and a former team-mate but he has an important date in Brazil first and then we will talk.'

Luis Enrique was also pressed on his ability to handle big egos after stories of fall-outs with Francesco Totti at Roma.

He said: 'On my last day at Roma he was one of the few players who came to see me off. There are so many stories about me falling out with Totti I even had my own mother asking me: "What’s happened with you and Totti?" There was never a problem between myself and the Roma players. You fall out with players, you make up and you carry on.

'I had a good relationship with Totti. I know how to manage a group and I know how to manage egos, I know how to prepare for matches. A coach has to be a leader and I am ready for that.'

The new Barcelona manager said he welcomed the reincorporation of Gerard Deulofeu, who spent last season at Everton and who he knows from his last era at the club.

'I want to build a new Barca that wins things and everyone loves to watch,' he said. 'I always said when I left Barca B it was more a, "See you soon" than a "Goodbye" and that is the way it has turned out. I always thought it was better for me to go elsewhere and come back with experience and now I’m ready to prepare for a great season.'

There was a message of support to his former team-mate Pep Guardiola, whom Barca are hoping he can emulate.

Old new methods: Enrique said he will not use some of the training routines he used while at Celta Vigo

'He has worked wonders in another league and I know how hard that can be,' he said.

A self-confessed cycling nut, marathon runner and triathlete he also said: 'I’m not going to get the bicycles out. We won’t be doing anything strange. It will be all about the ball and about everyone enjoying training again because this is a wonderful profession.'

Asked if he will be using his famous scaffolding tower to observe training sessions as he did at Celta Vigo he said: 'I used it at Roma too. It helps me have a better vision of the sessions but I have an excellent stand here at Barca so it won’t be necessary.'
