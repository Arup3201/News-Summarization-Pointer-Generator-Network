The father of Sabrina Allen, the 17-year-old girl who was went missing aged 4 and was finally rescued earlier this week, has said that his daughter was ‘not living a regular life’ during her 12 years in captivity. 

Greg Allen has yet to be reunited with his daughter Sabrina, who was rescued in Papalotla, Tlaxcala, near Mexico City, during a secret mission on Tuesday morning.

'She's in pretty bad shape, from my understanding,' said Allen as he became emotional speaking about his long lost daughter.

Never giving up: Sabrina's father, Greg Allen (pictured), hired a private investigator to find his daughter and it was a tip sent to this PI last month that ultimately led to the girl's rescue

'Sabrina has been under an intense campaign to hate me for 12 years. She's currently under the care of a therapist that specializes in cases like this.'

As Allen waits anxiously to reunite with his daughter, he said he is already working to line up support that will help her get up to speed on everything she missed.

'She was not living a regular life,' he said. 'She has not been going to school.' 

In a video he posted to GoFundMe page on Wednesday, Allen said that Sabrina had been found with her blonde locks dyed brown. 

Her mother, Dara Llorens, had started dyeing her hair after she was kidnapped. 

Safe: The little girl, pictured as a child, was four years old when she was taken. Her mother dyed her blonde hair to escape authorities and moved around with her constantly to avoid being found

Emotional: In a video released on Wednesday, Sabrina's father Greg said that his daughter had been told that she didn't want him and that he had committed suicide. They have yet to be reunited

'She was effectively a prisoner in a two-bedroom apartment,' he said. 'She has been told that I didn't want her and that I committed suicide. She was also told that both of my parents are dead.'

On April 19, 2002, Llorens allegedly took her daughter for a scheduled weekend visit as part of a court-ordered child custody agreement.

But she never returned Sabrina to her father, who was her primary guardian, at the end of that weekend, according to the FBI.

Llorens, now 44 and pictured in her mugshot for the first time in more than a decade, has been charged with aggravated kidnapping. She is now in the custody of Austin authorities and is being held on a $300,000 bond.

According to her ex-husband she had undergone 'extensive plastic surgery' in an effort to hide from investigators.

Caught: Dara Llorens has been captured 12 years after snatching her daughter, then four, from Texas and fleeing to Mexico. Her ex-husband said she had undergone plastic surgery to elude authorities

Authorities said that Llorens had repeatedly moved around with her daughter, always fearful investigators or Greg Allen would catch up with them.

Still, Sabrina is physically well and has dreams for the future, including becoming a ballerina, authorities said. 

'I want to know her. She’s a completely different person, but they say personalities are formed by age five,' Allen told KVUE. '[I'm] hoping she has some memories still.'

Allen, who has since remarried and has had more children, said that the 12-year search for his daughter had been a roller coaster filled with false leads.

'I was Ahab and the white whale. I was not going to survive,' he said. 'It's a long road. You don't know what the outcome is.'  

Snatched: Llorens allegedly took her daughter into Mexico after she was supposed to hand the child over to the custody of her father. Greg Allen said his ex-wife has apparently had plastic surgery to appear different

Apartment: They were found living in Papalotla, Tlaxcala near Mexico City and captured on Tuesday morning

The rescue came thanks to an anonymous tip sent last month to Private Investigator Philip Klein, whom Greg Allen hired nine years ago.

After receiving the tip, Klein contacted state and federal authorities to confirm the identities of the woman and girl using facial recognition. After watching them for two weeks, agents swooped in.

'She put up quite a good fight,' Klein said of Llorens. 'There were minor injuries to one of the agents.' 

Greg Allen has stayed committed to the search over the past decade and the case has twice featured on 'America's Most Wanted'.

Sabrina had also been listed as missing by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, while her mother was on the FBI's Most Wanted list. 

Llorens allegedly violated a court-ordered child custody agreement and disappeared with the child shortly after taking her on April 19, 2002, during a scheduled weekend visit.

When she was supposed to return the girl two days later, she never did.

Taken: Sabrina Allen, who is now 17, has returned to Texas and is being evaluated, her family said

The mother and her daughter were tracked down to Mexico City after 14 months but managed to get away from authorities. Pictures taken at the time showed the girl's blonde locks dyed brown.

At the time, they were living under the assumed names Blanca Aurora Fabian Urieb and Adriana Fabian Uribe. They were last seen living there in June 2003.

Last March, Greg Allen vowed never to give up looking for his daughter.

'I want to find her,' Allen told Fox7. 'I want to see her again. She needs to know she has a family that loves her. I can't just give up on her.'
