Bastian Schweinsteiger believes hosts Brazil have been allowed to get away with 'hard tackling' at the World Cup so far - and has urged referees to be harsher in their punishment.

Germany face Brazil in the semi-finals on Tuesday in Belo Horizonte and Schweinsteiger is keen for the referee to keep a close eye on Luis Felipe Scolari's side.

The hosts committed 31 fouls during their 2-1 quarter-final victory over Colombia - who themselves offended 23 times - and Juan Zuniga's foul even ended Brazilian Neymar's World Cup by fracturing his vertebra.

Schweinsteiger said: 'I am all for a healthy hardness but some of Brazil's fouls were over the limit.'

'Brazilians are not only football magicians, hard tackling is part of their game - we have to be careful and so does the referee.'

And the midfielder's views were echoed by Germany assistant coach Hansi Flick.

He said: 'Brazil is an outstanding team that plays at the limit of the allowed and will go over the limit if necessary.

'(Neymar's injury) It's definitely a loss for Brazil, Neymar has lived up to expectations, but his absence can unite the team more and we expect a very strong opponent,' Flick said.

And Schweinsteiger said that although 'we are all very sad that Neymar is not playing', Brazil's squad will be even more tightly knit as they 'will try to win the title for Neymar'.

The 29-year-old Bayern Munich midfielder was also full of praise for the Brazilian coaching staff of Scolari and his assistant Carlos Alberto Parreira.

'They are two coaches with a lot of experience who have both won the World Cup,' he said.

'They are clever coaches and you need intelligent coaches to win the title.'
