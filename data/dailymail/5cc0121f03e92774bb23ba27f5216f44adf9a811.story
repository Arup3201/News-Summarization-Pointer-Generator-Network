Facebook is increasingly being used to kidnap Indonesian children who are shipped off to a life of slavery in brothels, say child protection teams.

This year alone, 27 of the 129 
children reported missing to Indonesia's National Commission for Child 
Protection are believed to have been abducted after meeting their 
captors on Facebook.

One of those befriended on the social media site has also been found dead.

Facebook chat: There are growing numbers of incidents involving social media networks being used as a means for children trafficking in Indonesia

A month since a girl kidnapped from her home on the outskirts of Jakarta, was
found near a bus terminal on September the 30th, there have been at least seven 
reports of young girls in Indonesia being abducted by people they met on
Facebook.

The 14-year-old girl says she 
received a Facebook friend request from an older man she didn't know, so
she accepted it out of curiosity.

The junior high student was quickly smitten by the man's smooth online flattery.

She didn't realise that he was one of the growing number of sexual predators who had found a new way to exploit Indonesia's increasing obsession with social 
media.

They exchanged phone numbers, and 
his attention increased with rapid-fire texts. He convinced her to meet 
in a mall, and she found him just as charming in person.

They agreed to meet again. After 
telling her mom she was going to visit a sick girlfriend on her way to 
church choir practice, she climbed into the man's minivan near her home 
in Depok.

The man, a 24-year-old who called 
himself Yogi, drove her an hour to the town of Bogor, West Java, she 
told The Associated Press in an interview.

There, he locked her in a small room inside a house with at least five other girls aged 14 to 17.

She was drugged and raped repeatedly - losing her virginity in the first violent session.

After one week of torture, her captor
told her she was being sold and shipped to the faraway island of Batam,
known for its seedy brothels and child sex tourism that caters to men 
coming by boat from nearby Singapore.

She sobbed hysterically and begged to go home. She was beaten and told to shut up or die.

Although no solid data exists, police
and aid groups that work on trafficking issues say it seems to be a 
particularly big problem in the Southeast Asian archipelago.

'Maybe Indonesia is kind of a unique country so far,' said Anjan Bose, a program officer who works on
child online protection issues at ECPAT International, a nonprofit 
global network that helps children in 70 countries.

'Once the reports start coming in, 
you will know that maybe it's not one of the countries, maybe it's one 
of a hundred countries.

'The Internet is such a global 
medium. It doesn't differentiate between poor and rich. It doesn't 
differentiate between the economy of the country or the culture.'

Websites that track social media say 
Indonesia has nearly 50 million people signed up for Facebook, making it
one of the world's top users after the U.S.

The capital, Jakarta, was recently named the most active Twitter city by Paris-based social media monitoring company Semiocast.

In addition, networking groups such as BlackBerry and Yahoo Messenger are wildly popular on mobile phones.

There are at least eight reported incidents this month alone in Indonesia of young girls being abducted and enslaved by men who approached them randomly on Facebook

Many young Indonesians, and their 
parents, are unaware of the dangers of allowing strangers to see their 
personal information online.

Teenagers frequently post photos and 
personal details such as their home address, phone number, school and 
hangouts without using any privacy settings - allowing anyone trolling 
the net to find them and learn everything about them.

'We are racing against time, and the technology frenzy over Facebook is a trend among teenagers here,' Sirait said.

'Police should move faster, or many more girls will become victims.'

The 27 Facebook-related abductions 
reported to the commission this year in Indonesia have already exceed 18
similar cases it received in all of 2011.

Overall, the National Task Force 
Against Human Trafficking said 435 children were trafficked last year, 
mostly for sexual exploitation.

Many who fight child sex crimes in Indonesia believe the real numbers are much higher.

Missing children are often not reported to authorities.

Stigma and shame surround sexual 
abuse in the world's largest Muslim-majority country, and there's a 
widespread belief that police will do nothing to help.

An ECPAT International report 
estimates that each year, 40,000 to 70,000 children are involved in 
trafficking, pornography or prostitution in Indonesia, a nation of 240 
million where many families remain impoverished.

The U.S. State Department has also warned that more Indonesian girls are being recruited using social media networks.

In a report last year, it said 
traffickers have 'resorted to outright kidnapping of girls and young 
women for sex trafficking within the country and abroad.'

Online child sexual abuse and exploitation are common in much of Asia.

In the Philippines, kids are being 
forced to strip or perform sex acts on live webcams - often by their 
parents, who are using them as a source of income. Western men typically
pay to use the sites.

'In the Philippines, this is the tip of the iceberg.

It's not only Facebook and social 
media, but it's also through text messages ... especially young, 
vulnerable people are being targeted,' said Leonarda Kling, regional 
representative for Terre des Hommes Netherlands, a nonprofit working on 
trafficking issues.

'It's all about promises. Better jobs or maybe even a nice telephone or whatever.

Young people now, you see all the 
glamour and glitter around you and they want to have the latest 
BlackBerry, the latest fashion, and it's also a way to get these 
things.'

Facebook says its investigators 
regularly review content on the site and work with authorities, 
including Interpol, to combat illegal activity.

It also has employees around the world tasked with cracking down on people who attempt to use the site for human trafficking.

'We take human trafficking very 
seriously and, while this behavior is not common on Facebook, a number 
of measures are in place to counter this activity,' spokesman Andrew 
Noyes said in an email.

He declined to give any details on Facebook's involvement in trafficking cases reported in Indonesia or elsewhere .

There are fears that the overall number of trafficked children remains grossly underestimated in Indonesia

The Depok girl, wearing a mask to 
hide her face as she was interviewed, said she is still shocked that the
man she knew for nearly a month turned on her.

'He wanted to buy new clothes for me, and help with school payments.

He was different ... that's all,' she said.

'I have a lot of contacts through Facebook, and I've also exchanged phone numbers.

But everything has always gone fine. We were just friends.'

She said that after being kidnapped, she was given sleeping pills and was 'mostly unconscious' for her ordeal.

She said she could not escape because a man and another girl stood guard over her.

The girl said the man did not have 
the money for a plane ticket to Batam, and also became aware that her 
parents and others were relentlessly searching for her.

He ended up dumping her at a bus station, where she found help.

'I am angry and cannot accept what he
did to me. ... I was raped and beaten!' said the lanky girl with 
shoulder-length black hair. 

The United Nations estimates that 80% of persons trafficked are trafficked for sexual exploitation. 

They are mostly women and children. (UN, 2003).An estimated 120,000 women and children are trafficked into Western Europe each year. (European Commission, 2001).800,000 people are trafficked across borders every year, of whom 80% are women and girls and some 50% are minors. (US Dept of State, 2005)9.8m are involved in unpaid work or prostitutionThe annual human trafficking industry is worth almost £20 billionSource: Congressional research Service / UN Global report on Trafficking

The girl's case made headlines this month when she was expelled after she tried to return to school.

Officials at the school reportedly claimed she had tarnished its image.

She has since been reinstated, but she no longer wishes to attend due to the stigma she faces.

Education Minister Mohammad Nuh also
came under fire after making remarks that not all girls who report such
crimes are victims:'They do it for fun, and then the girl alleges that 
it's rape,' he said.

His response to the criticism was that it's difficult to prove whether sexual assault allegations are 'real rapes.'

The publicity surrounding the story 
encouraged the parents of five other missing girls to come forward this 
month, saying their daughters also were victimized by people they met on
Facebook.

Two more girls were freed from their captors in October and are now seeking counseling.

A man who posed as a photographer on Facebook was recently arrested and accused of kidnapping and raping three teenage girls.

Authorities say he lured them into meeting him with him by promising to make them models, and then locked them in a house.

Police found dozens of photos of naked girls on his camera and laptop.

Another case involved a 15-year-old girl from Bogor.

She was recently rescued by police 
after being kidnapped by her Facebook 'friend' and held at a restaurant,
waiting for someone to move her to another town where she would be 
forced into prostitution.

In some incidents, the victims 
themselves ended up recruiting other young girls after being promised 
money or luxuries such as mobile phones or new clothes.

Police are trying to get a step ahead of the criminals.

Detective Lt. Ruth Yeni Qomariah 
from the Children and Women's Protection unit in Surabaya said she posed
as a teenager online and busted three men who used Facebook to kidnap 
and rape underage girls.

She's searching for a fourth suspect.

'It has been getting worse as 
trafficking rings become more sophisticated and underage children are 
more easily targeted,' she said.

The man who abducted the Depok girl 
has not been found, and it's unclear what happened to the five other 
girls held at the house where she was raped.

'I saw they were offered by my kidnapper to many guys,' she said. 'I don't know what happened. I don't want to remember it.'
