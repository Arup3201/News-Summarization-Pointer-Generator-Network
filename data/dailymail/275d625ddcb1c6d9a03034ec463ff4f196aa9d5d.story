With high-profile campaigns for Chanel and Agent Provocateur under her belt, Crystal Renn is one of today’s top models.

However, the 28-year-old from Mississippi, hasn't had a straight trajectory to success. Her career began with drastic dieting, followed by years of anorexia - all in an effort to obtain the correct model proportions. It was only when she re-gained weight and entered the world of plus-size fashion that she truly found success.

Speaking to the Telegraph, Crystal explains why she decided to write 'Hungry', which details her own battles with anorexia and her journey to body acceptance,

She says she wanted to encourage ‘people to question preconceived notions about what it means to be beautiful and the dangerous lengths some are willing to go to attain this.’

Crystal lost a staggering 42 per cent of her body weight after a model scout told her at age 14 that her Amazonian height and striking features meant she could be a model if she lost weight.

‘I wanted to tell the story of my life up until this point which included many tribulations to overcome,’ Renn told the Telegraph.

‘I had an unquenchable need to succeed at such a young age, to make something out of myself and to experience the world. I wanted. I know I used to have warped thinking but I changed and I wanted to help others change too.

‘Evolving my mindset opened me up to an entire world of possibilities and a peace that I had not previously known. So I felt I had to pass it on.’

Crystal's story is particularly positive because, as well as recovering from her eating disorder she found success once she had reached a more healthy weight

Considering her time as a ‘normal size’ model was spent in misery, starving herself and frantically exercise to maintain her size 0-2 figure, it is little surprise that Crystal says the worst thing about modelling is ‘the lack of control’.

Crystal’s story is particularly positive because, as well as recovering- beginning to eat again after realising she would die if she continued to starve herself- she found success once she had reached a more healthy weight.

After years of anorexia, she regained the near 5st (32kg) she had lost.

At a US size 12 (UK size 16), Crystal is hardly massive, but her beauty and presence have made her the go-to plus size model for high end designers.

Having since fronted the  F/W 2010 Jean Paul Gautier campaign as well as appearing in campaigns for Mango, H&M, Zac Posen, Channel, Jimmy Choo and Dolce & Gabbana, Crystal is now developing a love of being behind, as well as in front, of the camera.

‘A love of images had brought me into modelling, and from there I think it was natural that I picked up a camera.’
