Convicted rapist Ched Evans will not be able to resume his football career overseas, following a Ministry of Justice intervention.

Maltese Premier League club Hibernians announced yesterday they had offered the 26-year-old former Sheffield United and Wales striker a six-month deal. 

But in a statement, the Ministry of Justice said that as a convicted sex offender on licence, Evans was effectively barred from working abroad.

The MoJ said that as a convicted sex offender on licence, Evans was effectively barred from working abroad

A spokesman said: 'We are determined to have one of the toughest regimes in the world for managing sex offenders, to stop them re-offending and to protect victims.

'Probation officers must give permission for sex offenders on licence to take up new jobs and this includes ensuring they hold regular face to face meetings - this effectively rules out working abroad.

'The offenders will also be subject to strict conditions such as exclusion zones, non-contact orders and having to attend sex offender treatment programmes.' 

Evans has been without a club since he was jailed for rape in 2012. 

Earlier, Malta's prime minister Joseph Muscat had warned Hibernians their decision to offer a contract to Evans risked damaging the country's reputation.

A tweet on the verified Twitter account of Muscat's office read: 'Footballers are role models. Hibs decision will define them + to an extent Malta. I hope (management) understand this clearly before final decision.'

But justice minister Owen Bonnici said the convicted rapist deserved the chance to resume his football career. 

He tweeted: 'Ched Evans should be given a second chance. If we believe in rehabilitation of ex-prisoners we should practice what we preach.'

Convicted rapist Ched Evans had been offered an unexpected route back into football by Maltese team Hibernians 

Evans had an offer to train with his former club Sheffield United but that was retracted in November after a public outcry. 

Television presenter Charlie Webster quit as a club patron, Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill asked for her name to be removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane and two shirt sponsors threatened to walk.

Tranmere Rovers, Oldham Athletic and Hartlepool United have all also rejected the opportunity to sign the Wales international after showing a degree of interest.

Yesterday, Hibernians vice-president Stephen Vaughan said: 'We are looking to secure the services of a top striker and Ched fits the bill.

'We've spoken to his agent and have offered a deal from now until the end of the season.' 

Hibernians technical director Jeffrey Farrugia told Sky Sports News he believed a deal is close.

'I think we are quite close,' he said. 'We are waiting for his agent to call.'

He added: 'Our vice-president has offered the contract until the end of the season to this glorious player to come over to Malta and play for our top team. We are leading the table at the moment.'

Asked if he had spoken to Evans, Mr Farrugia said: 'Me personally, no, but Mr Stephen (Vaughan) yes, he met him in the UK. They sat down with his agent so they can speak about a contract.' 

The Maltese club said they had 'no problem' signing Evans and that the Wales international deserved a second chance

He went on to say there would be no outcry in Malta if the club were to sign the convicted rapist.  

'We have no problem with that,' Mr Farrugia said yesterday. 'He was punished and he did his sentence so he should have a second chance, and our club is ready, the door is open for him to start his new career again in professional football.

'I don't think it's a wrong message. Everybody in life has mistakes, so you should have your second chance.'

He added of the possibility of protests against Evans at Hibernians' stadium: 'There won't be anything of this at our club. And I can't understand sometimes how English football, English clubs, think about all these things. Everybody must have a second chance. He paid for what he did, for us it's not an issue.'  

Mr Farrugia added: 'For a player like him it's good to come to Malta to play these 26 games. He will be in the window for end of season, many clubs I'm sure they will go for him, so it's good for him to come here and enjoy the game of football.

'(He's) a big asset for our club, (to have) the big quality of this player join our club. We need players like him in Malta.' 

Evans wants to return to football after being released from prison in October. He served two-and-a-half years of a five-year sentence after being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011.
