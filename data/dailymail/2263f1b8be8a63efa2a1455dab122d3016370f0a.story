Choosing the right outfit for an awards ceremony is a task riddled with possible pitfalls. Despite armies of stylists, hairdressers and free designers goodies at their disposal, stars often get their red carpet look terribly wrong.

At tonight's BAFTAs in London's Covent Garden, many missed the mark with ill-fitting gowns, too much cleavage and skint-tight satin all featuring on the list of fashion fails. 

Some celebrities tripped up by being over zealous with their accessories and hairdos - Anne Marie Duff's curling irons will be needing a well-deserved rest after creating her poodle perm this evening while Natalie Dormer's lace finger-less gloves were a nod to Madonna that should have stayed in the Eighties. 

Other stars floundered with their choice of colour - Sarah Jane Crawford was washed out by her pale pink gown and Sienna Guilroy's dress sparked memories of creamed spinach in the school canteen. But some of the biggest offenders came down to a lack of effort, as demonstrated by the singer Mica Levi, who arrived in a baggy PVC raincoat. 

Here FEMAIL round-up the worst dressed... 

Scroll down for video 

British singer Mica Levi might have been prepared for the chilly British weather but her baggy coat and PVC creepers were underwhelming 

Sara MacDonald, pictured here with Noel Gallagher, wore a baggy dress that swamped her petite frame 

IT girl Hofit Gola's red carpet outfit would have been more appropriate on a showgirl, left, while she looked like she'd been inspired by Big Bird with this bright yellow gown she changed into for the Weinstein Company afterparty, right 

Captain America star Hayley Atwell suffered a wardrobe malfunction as her dress ripped at the seam under her arm

The shade of Homeland Nimrat Kaur's pink dress would have been better suited to a five-year-old girl, left. She didn't fare much better when she changed for the afterparty, right, and wore this unusual graphic print dress that will make your eyes go funny if you look at it for too long 

I'm A Celebrity contestant Nadia Forde's satin gown was ill-fitting and looked cheap

Doctor Who actress Jenna Coleman wore a dress with too fussy floral print with an unflattering cut away section at the midriff

TV presenter Sarah Jane Crawford wore a shade of pink that made her appear washed out

Sienna Guillory wore a shade of green often used in 1970s bathrooms

Anne-Marie Duff's curly hairstyle was similar to a shaggy poodle 

Natalie Dormer wore a beautiful dark blue gown but her look was ruined with lacy finger-less gloves 

Actress Romola Garai looks like she wore a size too big for her as she's swamped by the fabric in this clashing pastels outfit

TV presenter Charlie Webster, who attended with her Downton Abbey and Imitation Game boyfriend Allen Leech, choose a bizarre one sleeved dress that was half lacy number and half folded stain that she accessorised with a chunky silver necklace

We know it was a cold evening but that's no excuse for Rachel Riley to wear this thick faux fur scarf that made her dress look less elegant 

Nick Cave's wife Susie Bick wore a questionable sheer and red velvet grown with a furry black scarf

MyAnna Buring's blue T-shirt dress was too plain for such a glamorous event 

Kara Tointon's gold dress looked like it could have been a leftover from her Strictly Come Dancing days 

Angelina Jolie was ridiculed for flashing her leg on the Oscars red carpet in 2012 with a black dress slashed to the thigh - it looks as though Alice Eve has stolen the look as she attended the Baftas, pictured left and right

Monica Bellucci's black gown was elegant but had a touch of Morticia Addams about it along with the actress's long, straight black hair 

Amy Adams was one of the best dressed on the red carpet in a white gown - so why did she change into this bra flashing black suit for the Weinstein afterparty which made it look like she'd forgotten to wear a blouse?

Kasabian's Serge Pizzorno went for an alternative 'black tie' accessorised with an animal tail tied to his belt
