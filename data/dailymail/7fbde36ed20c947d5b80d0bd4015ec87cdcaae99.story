It twists and turns, winding its way across a Chinese river connecting two communities.

This knot-shaped pedestrian bridge will span 184metres across the Longwanggang River in Changsha, the capital of China's southern Hunan Province.

The bright red unique design merges the idea of the Chinese knot and is inspired by the neighbouring mountain ranges.

At its widest the bridge will measure 11.5metres, narrowing to 2.5metres at its slimmest point.

Dutch architects NEXT were awarded the first prize in an international competition to design the bridge for Meixi Lake.

Designed to be 'more than just a connection', the bridge will become a key public space, part of a new lakeside development.

The bridge will feature recreational, ecological programmes, as well as activities aimed at tourists.

'The bridge echoes the neighboring mountain ridges. Walking over the bridge, people will have different perspectives,' said Jiang Xiaofei, general manager of Next Architects' Chinese office.

'The construction, with the intersecting connections, is based on the principal of the MÃ¶bius ring,' said Michel Schreinemachers.

'On the other hand, it refers to a Chinese knot that comes from an ancient decorative Chinese folk art,' adds John van de Water.

Construction begins next month and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.

The design is said to mimic the nearby mountain ranges
