A former Liberal Democrat peer who fell out with Nick Clegg, has put up a £600,000 fighting fund to help Ed Miliband become prime minister.

Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay resigned last year after he was accused of plotting against his leader by paying for private research showing Mr Clegg would lose his seat.

Last night it was revealed that the peer, who sits in the House of Lords as an independent, has bankrolled 30 Labour and 15 Lib Dem candidates to boost the chances of a Left-wing Coalition government.

He confirmed he had donated £300,000 to Labour candidates – who received £10,000 each; and another £300,000 to 15 Lib Dem candidates, including eight current MPs contesting their seats again.

Finally, he handed £10,000 to the office of the Green Party’s only MP, Caroline Lucas.

The money, which has gone to candidates fighting marginal seats, is intended to halt a ‘Tory government cringing to Ukip’ and avoid a referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union.

Lord Oakeshott said he wanted to help create a ‘Labour led government headed by Ed Miliband as prime minister’ and praised the Labour leader for resting the clamour for a vote on the EU.

A former close friend of business secretary Vince Cable - who he hoped would take over as party leader – the peer was a long-term thorn in the side of Mr Clegg.

He was forced to step down as a Treasury spokesman in 2011 for attacking a government deal with the banks - aimed at increasing lending and reducing bonuses – as ‘pitiful and incompetent’.

Since then, he repeatedly called for Mr Clegg to be sacked and the Coalition to be broken up.

Last May, when he stood down from the party after the polling was revealed, he left with a parting shot accusing the Deputy Prime Minister of presiding over a ‘cash for peerages’ scandal.

Mr Cable was forced to apologise for breaking parliamentary rules for not disclosing that the private polling – which cost £6,000 – had been done by his wealthy friend.

Lord Oakeshott was a one-time Labour party member who stood for election in 1974 before defecting to the SDP in 1981, standing unsuccessfully for another seat two years later.

Instead, he became a director of Warburg Investment Management before setting up his own property investment company.

He told the Financial Times last night that he is now a ‘non-party social democrat’ and wants to build a ‘progressive alliance’ among Labour, the Lib Dems and the Green Party.

‘Many Lib Dem and Labour candidates tell me the Tories have spent over £100,000 campaigning against them, even before the official election campaign started in December’, he said.

‘I’ve taken a leave of absence from the Lords and am just a non-party social democrat now, but I want to help save our country from a Tory government cringing to Ukip.’

The donations have been given discreetly over the past two months but are due to be made public shortly by the Electoral Commission.

None of the Lib Dems Lord Oakeshott is bankrolling are in senior positions in the party – although ministers Danny Alexander, Jo Swinson and David Laws are likely to struggle to keep their seats.

He has handed £20,000 each to eight sitting MPs in marginal seats on the left wing of the party such as John Pugh – the only Lib Dem MP to openly call for Mr Clegg’s resignation, and Norman Baker who resigned as a home office minister. 

A further seven candidates have received £20,000 each. Mr Cable is not one of them.

He is funding Labour candidate Will Straw, the son of Jack Straw who is standing in the marginal Rossendale and Darwen seat held by Tory MP Jack Berry.

Also the Labour candidates in Hastings and Rye, where Conservative Treasury minister Amber Rudd is defending a slim majority, and Great Grimsby, in Lincolnshire where veteran Labour MP Austin Mitchell is standing down and Ukip have been tipped to win the seat.

‘Britain stands on the edge of a cliff with the general election only 105 days away’, he said. ‘Will we vote Tory or Ukip for Euro referendum chaos, lasting two years at least and putting thousands of businesses, millions of jobs and our long term peace and security at risk?

‘Or will Labour, Liberal Democrat, Green and all progressive voters come together in the marginal seats that matter to elect a Parliament for progress and reform and a Labour-led Government with Ed Miliband as prime minister?

‘He has stood firm against the clamour for a referendum with considerable courage and nous. Scotland shows how referenda, even with 55-45 vote, can settle nothing, just open a can of worms.’

A Lib Dem source last night said: ‘It’s not surprising, Lord Oakeshott has been on a path to destruction since he resigned. 

'He has apparently left politics but clearly couldn’t help himself. 

'Money can get you so far in politics, but only if you have a leader who connects with people and the right policies in place.’
