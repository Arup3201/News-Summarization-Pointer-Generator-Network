Coming together for a cause: (L-R) Chris Bath, Marta Dusseldorp, Michelle Bridges, Natarsha Belling, Nicky Buckley, Gabi Hollows, and Rebecca Gibney pose together to support National Prevention Week 2015

Network Ten presenter Natarsha Belling wears a black lace dress for the photo shoot in her role as Heart Health Ambassador.

A study by Journal of the American College of Cardiology suggests that adopting six simple habits can cut the risk of heart disease by a staggering 92 per cent, Prevention magazine has reported.

The lifestyle changes include sticking to one alcoholic drink a day, eating a high-quality diet low in red meat and trans fats, not smoking, maintaining a healthy body weight, exercising for at least 2.5 hours a week and watching less than seven hours of TV a week.

Belling, 39, is an ambassador for Heart Research Australia, and told the magazine about the effect witnessing her father's heart attack had on her.

Simple changes: 2.5 hours of exercise per week, a high-quality diet, and sticking to just one alcoholic drink per week may reduce your risk of heart disease by 92 per cent

'Heart disease is an extraordinarily important issue, which hit home for me recently when my dad suffered a heart attack and underwent major surgery,' she said. 

'Once you see a loved one crippled with heart disease, you realise how debilitating it is.' 

Cardiovascular disease (including heart, stroke and blood vessel diseases) affects one in six Australians.

Accounting for 13 per cent of all deaths, it claimed the lives of 20,046 Australians in 2012.  Each year, around 55,000 Australians suffer a heart attack, equating to one heart attack every 10 minutes.

Chris Bath, 47, wears a strapless black sheer striped dress for the photo shoot. The Seven News anchor is the Stroke Ambassador for the campaign, which runs from March 23 - 29, in an effort to raise awareness about preventable health.

'I'm on board National Prevention Week with this wonderful bunch of women because I believe in getting the most out of life and so do they,' she said. Without a doubt, it's an initiative that saves lives by giving people vital information about how best to preserve good health. 

'I learned so much about one of our most preventable diseases, stroke, after my Dad had one. I was horrified to discover there has never been Federal funding to tell Australians how to save themselves from stroke, yet around 80 per cent of strokes are preventable. 

'It's our second biggest killer and leading cause of adult disability. So why not get the message out there about how best to stave off a stroke? Why not give people the information they need to live healthy lives? Why not save the health system money by preventing illness before it strikes? It's what National Prevention Week is all about. Bring it on.'

Mental Health Ambassador Rebecca Gibney, who looks sensational in an intricate blue gown in the shoot, opened up to the magazine about her personal battle with mental illness. 

The 50-year-old actress revealed that she remained silent about her own struggle with severe anxiety from her teens until she was well into her early thirties, as a result of feeling overwhelmed by a sense of guilt.

'I couldn't explain it because on the surface my life looked perfect,' she said. 'I had a wonderful job, great friends and a fabulous family, so consequently I felt guilty.'

According to the Mental Health Council of Australia, almost half the total population (45.5 per cent) experience a mental health disorder at some point in their lifetime.

Depression is predicted to be one of the world's largest health problems by 2020.

Model and TV personality Nicky Buckley is Ovarian Cancer Ambassador. 'Having lost my precious mum to Ovarian Cancer ten years ago, I am proud to be the Ovarian Cancer Ambassador for National Prevention Week to help shine a light on the need to focus on preventative health for women over 40,' she said.

'In doing so, I encourage women to put themselves first, listen to their bodies, and give themselves the best possible chance of early detection.' 

Marta Dusseldorp is currently dazzling onscreen in A Place To Call Home. The in-demand actress is using her star power for a good cause as Breast Cancer Ambassador for the campaign.

'Breast Cancer affects so many people - younger, older, mothers, daughters and grandmothers,' she said. 'It is important to support those who have gone through breast cancer and to never give up the search for a cure. As an ambassador I hope to keep the conversation going and to help shine a light on all the incredible people who work tirelessly to combat it.'

Statistics from the National Breast Cancer Foundation states that on average, seven women die from breast cancer every day in Australia, while one in eight women will develop breast cancer in their lifetime.

'Doing something is better than doing nothing': Fitness Ambassador Michelle Bridges encourages women to make fitness part of their daily routine, like brushing their teeth

Fitness guru Michelle Bridges joins the host of TV stars as Fitness Ambassador.

'What I've always tried to tell people is that doing something is better than doing nothing,' she said. 'You don't need to love fitness to make it a part of your lifestyle, you just need to do SOMETHING and make it a small part of your day, everyday. Eventually it becomes habit and routine. 

'You don't need to motivate yourself to brush your teeth because its routine and in just the same way, you don't need motivation for fitness, just consistency. Preventative health is not about being perfect, it's about being consistent and committed to making a positive change about your future.' 

Finally, esteemed eye health campaigner Gabi Hollows rounds out the group of ambassadors for National Prevention Week. The Fred Hollows Foundation's Founding Director is Eye Health Ambassador.

'We couldn't be more thrilled to join forces with seven of Australia's most high profile women to raise awareness around the power of preventative health,' said Jacqueline Mooney, editor of Prevention magazine. 'Now in its third year, National Prevention Week continues to go from strength to strength with the introduction of three new causes: heart disease, ovarian cancer and preventable blindness.

'Each of our ambassadors has been personally touched by the issue they've chosen to champion, and we've been blown away by their support. What many of us don't realise is that just one tiny health change a day can have a hugely positive impact. It's a message we're extremely passionate about and, through National Prevention Week, we hope to reach as many women as possible.'
