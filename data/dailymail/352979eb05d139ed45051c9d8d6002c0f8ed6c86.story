Summer music festivals are an optimum setting for comradery: warm weather, vast crowds and internationally acclaimed music.

This recipe is perfectly embodied in an heartwarming video uploaded this week, showing revellers in a mosh pit hoisting a wheelchair bound punter above the crowd for a better view of the stage.

The vision, which comes from Brisbane Future Music Festival on Saturday, shows the elated reveller fist pumping and waving to those around him as upbeat dance music plays from the main stage.

The man is then cautiously lowered down, clearly overjoyed with his elevated experience.

Future Music held the Queensland leg of the tour in Doomben Racecourse, 7 kilometres north of the Brisbane central business district.

The event boasted an all-star international line-up, including the likes of Drake, Prodigy and Avici. 

On Friday Queensland police seized 7,500 ecstasy pills believed to be heading for the Brisbane event as part of anti-bikie raids.

Police charged 17 people with 110 offences. The pills had an estimated value of $500,000.
