A Florida man has been charged with raping a woman aboard a yacht.

Rafal Dowgwillowicz-Nowicki of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is said to have forced the woman to have sex with him while she was a guest aboard the Endless Summer, threatening to kill her if she did not.

Dowgwillowicz-Nowicki, who works on the boat, has denied these allegations.  

Police tell the Sun Sentinel that after a night of heavy drinking, Dowgwillowicz-Nowicki, 39, returned to the vessel at 12:40am and began banging on the door of the stateroom in which the woman was staying.

When she opened the door, police claim he pushed his way in and raped the woman, pulling her hair, grabbing her throat and slapping her in the process. 

Dowgwillowicz-Nowicki told authorities the two did have 'rough sex,' but that is was completely consensual. 

He also said that the woman seemed to enjoy the encounter.

The Polish born Dowgwillowicz-Nowicki was released on $15,000 bail Thursday and told he was not to leave the county, while also having no contact with the woman and staying at least 500-feet away from the Endless Summer.

The judge in the case did however tell him he could work on other boats, so long as they were docked and not out at sea.

Dowgwillowicz-Nowicki appeared with a Polish translator for his court date, saying only; 'I'm going to stay in the U.S.'

Built in 1986, the Endless Summer is 126-foot luxury yacht that can accommodate 10 guests  with five staterooms, a spa pool and two wet bars.

The vessel, originally built and launched in Australia, underwent a refit in 2009, and can reach a cruising speed of 22 knots.
