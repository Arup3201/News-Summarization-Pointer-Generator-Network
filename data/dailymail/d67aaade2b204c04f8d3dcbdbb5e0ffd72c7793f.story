Suspected of sickening crimes including murder, kidnapping and rape, these are the faces of the most wanted foreign criminals in the UK.

The 16 fugitives have fled their own countries in a desperate bid to escape the law - and are now lying low in Britain.

But Scotland Yard is determined to catch the high-risk offenders and has taken the unusual step of releasing their pictures in an attempt to bring them to justice.

Three of the on-the-run suspects are wanted for murder.

The public are being urged not to approach the suspects who are considered dangerous.

It is the third time the Metropolitan Police has run Operation Sunfire.

The
aim is to trace and arrest the suspected criminals, haul them before 
the courts and seek their extradition so they can face justice abroad.

Publishing the fugitives’ photographs will increase the chance of them being spotted and caught.

Extensive police inquiries have not yet found them.

Detective Sergeant Peter Rance, 
leading the operation for the Met Extradition Unit, said: ‘Do you 
recognise these faces? Maybe you know where these people live, work or 
socialise?

‘They are wanted 
to face justice for a multitude of crimes in other countries and it is 
in the UK’s interests to help find them.’

Police
believe it is as likely that the fugitives will be recognised from a 
social networking site or chatroom, such as Facebook or Twitter, as 
spotted walking down the street.

Lord Ashcroft, the Tory peer who launched the Crimestoppers hotline, said: ‘People should have the right to live without the fear of crime and we are encouraging the public to call us completely anonymously if they recognise any of these individuals or have any information as to their whereabouts.

‘By working together and speaking up, we can all take steps towards making the UK safer.’
