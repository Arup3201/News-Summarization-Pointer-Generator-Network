Police say that a 17-year-old male suspect has turned himself in today after shooting two high school students in Philadelphia yesterday.

The teen is charged with two counts of aggravated assault and other related offenses. Police obtained a warrant for his home at the 7400 block of Rugby Street where he was questioned and eventually tuned himself over to law enforcement at around 1 p.m.

Two other teenage suspects were questioned but neither of them were charged. Police say the shooting may have been an accident, reports CBS.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Scene: The shooting took place inside the gym at Delaware Valley Charter High School in northern Philadelphia and the two victims were teenage students but are both said to be in stable condition

Police obtained a warrant for the suspect who turned himself in at the 7400 block of Rugby street

The first suspect police questioned was a 15-year-old male that matched a description provided by school security. The authorities took him into custody immediately following the shooting but later realized that he was not involved.

His angered parents said he was a 'straight A student' and police believe that school security misinformed them about the boy, reports NBC.

The other suspect, A 16-year-old male, was questioned at Philadelphia Police's Northwest Detective Division and is thought to have been a co-conspirator in the shooting. He was not charged at this time.

The Shooting took place Friday at around 3.20pm in the gym of Delaware Valley Charter High School in Philadelphia.

'There is a video and according to the video there were roughly 7 kids in there- it wasn't a gym class some where shooting hoops,' police commissioner Charles Ramsey said to CBS Philadelphia.

For the first hour after the shooting, police were searching for the suspect as he was able to flee the scene but they used the video tape to try and identify the suspect.

Authorities say a male student, 17, and a female student, 19, were shot in the arm.

The students were taken to Albert Einstein Medical Center in stable condition. The girl was released but the boy is still in the hospital.

Arrested: Police commissioner Charles Ramsey reported that a 15 year old male suspect was arrested at his house about an hour after shooting but that he was not involved in any way

Caught: The suspect, who has so far only been identified as a male, was caught by police as he was either entering or leaving his home on this block in Philadelphia about an hour after the shooting

Police Inspector Joe Sullivan tells KYW-TV it's unclear whether the shots were fired from inside or outside the school.

A spokesman for the school district hasn't responded to a call seeking comment.

Yesterday's  incident in the Logan neighborhood in Philadelphia is the second school shooting of the new year as two students were injured by a fellow student in New Mexico.

A shotgun was used in the Tuesday shooting Roswell shooting but the make of weapon from yesterday has not been released.

Police say the school already has security and metal detectors.
