Experts were left baffled when they were asked to identify these mysterious orange frogs that appeared in the snow in Derby.

Four of the strange amphibians were spotted hopping around in the snow, but wildlife experts were left stumped as to what they were.

But after  MailOnline contacted the Zoological Society of London, the team leader of London Zoo's reptile house got back to identify them as African clawed frogs.

Ben Tapley said the creatures are commonly kept as pets, suggesting that they may have escaped from someone's home before they were spotted in a suburban alleyway

The cold-blooded creatures had a lucky escape when Steve Atkin, 55, spotted them in a snow-covered alley behind his house in south-west Derby.

He initially thought they were toys but got a shock when he reached out to touch one.

'I saw what looked like a frog sticking out of the snow and I thought it was a toy but it moved when I went to touch it,' he said.

'I told my wife and she told me to go and rescue them. I've got them in a bowl of water at my house. I have no idea what they are.

'There were four of them but one has died. I want someone who knows what they are to take them off my hands.'

Before MailOnline was able to get the 
specimens identified, pictures and video footage of the frogs were sent 
to the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, but no one knew what they were.

Chris Wood, from the trust, said he had asked experts in Manchester to try to identify the creatures.

He feared the potential impact a species from overseas could have on native wildlife.

'We are a bit stumped by this one, definitely not a native though,' he said.

'We
don't know what they are yet but we are always a little concerned about
alien species escaping from captivity, as it can sometimes have dire 
consequences for our own wildlife.

'We would want to avoid that type of situation.'

Mystery: Pictures and video have been sent to the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust, the Natural History Museum and the Zoological Society of London in an effort to get the unusual amphibians properly identified

MailOnline contacted the Natural History Museum and the Zoological Society of London in an attempt to get an identification, with the latter quickest off the mark with a positive ID.

Found throughout Africa, the clawed frogs' name is derived from the three short claws on each hind foot - unique among frogs - which they use to tear apart their food.

The reptiles - whose official name is Xenopus laevis, where Xenopus means 'strange foot' and laevis means 'smooth' - can grow up to a length of five inches and are commonly kept as pets.

Xenopus laevis have been kept as pets and research subjects since as early as the Fifties. They are extremely hardy and long lived, having been known to live up to 20 or even 30 years in captivity.
