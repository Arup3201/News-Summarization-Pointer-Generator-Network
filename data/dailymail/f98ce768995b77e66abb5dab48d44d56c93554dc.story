King Midas could be putting his name down for the first batch of new iPad minis, if this leaked image is to be believed.

The photo, which emerged on a Chinese tech website, shows what appears to be a gold backplate for the next incarnation of Apple's ground-breaking tablet computer.

If genuine it suggests that the Silicon Valley firm is to release its new iPads in the same colour schemes as the iPhone 5s, the gold version of which became an instant must-have accessory.

The Midas touch: This photo first published by a Chinese tech site purports to show a gold backplate for the new iPad mini, suggesting Apple may continue its strategy of releasing its new gadgets in a choice of colours

The photo purporting to show the iPad Mini 2 component was published on Chinese website DoNews, alongside a second image apparently showing the front of the device, where it is equipped with a Touch ID fingerprint sensor.

Rumours suggest that Apple will launch successors to its current range of tablets at an event on next month, and previously leaked photos have already hinted that the tablets could come in a range of colourful cases.

Apple is yet to officially confirm the date of its next product launch, but analysts have begun pointing towards the 15 October.

During the iPhone announcement on 10 September, Apple's CEO Tim Cook said: 'Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new 
hardware, software and services that we can’t wait to introduce this 
fall and throughout 2014.'

The current iPad mini came out in 
November 2012 and if Apple follows suit, this would suggest a 
mid-October announcement followed by an early-November sale date, all in
time for Christmas. 

The price of the current iPads is also being cut in various regions, suggesting a new tablet is coming.

Apple is rumoured to gearing up to launch an iPad 5 and an iPad mini 2, on 15 October. The latest leaked images from technology site Tactus, allegedly show the rear shell of the iPad 5, pictured, with brightly coloured cases

It's likely the iPad mini 2 will keep the current 7.9-inch screen and not drop to 7-inches, in a bid to stay slightly bigger than Google's Nexus 7 and Tesco's new Hudl.

If Apple adds the Retina display seen on its new iPhones and larger iPads, its possible the second-generation iPad mini will be heavier and thicker.

However, leaked photos of casing suggest it will be thinner - suggesting Apple will wait to add the high-definition display to later models.

According to Apple site, 9to5Mac, the rumoured iPad 5 will also keep the 9.7-inch, high-resolution screen seen on older models.

The camera is due an upgrade and is 
rumoured to move to an 8MP rear-facing lens, with the possibility of 
even a 12MP camera being added.

Leaked images from Tactus additionally suggest the iPad 5 will be thinner than its predecessors.

Technology site Expert Reviews believes Apple will stick with its traditional pricing strategy for both models and charge the same price for its new products as it did for the outgoing models.

For example, the 16GB iPad 5 is expected to cost around £399, this raises to £479 for 32GB and £559 for 64GB.

If Apple additionally follows its 
iPad 4 launch and introduces a 128GB iPad 5 model, this should start at 
around £639 for 128GB, while 4G-ready models will cost more still.

Similarly, the iPad mini is expected 
to launch with at around £269 for 16GB and then in £80 increments for 
the 32BG and 64GB models. Models with 3G and 4G access will cost more.
