A controversial marketing stunt in which homeless people were paid to act as walking wifi hotspots at a festival appears to have paid off - after they used the money to find housing.

Branding agency BBH-Labs gave a mobile a 4G MiFi device to each participant and paid them $50 a day to walk around the SXSW music and technology festival in Austin, Texas, with t-shirts saying 'I'm a 4G hotspot'.

It was suggested users paid $2 for every 15 minutes and the homeless could keep all the donations.

Clarence was one of the homeless people paid $20 a day plus any donations he was given to offer people a wifi service

The daring ploy, named Homeless Hotspots, was condemned by some as 'dystopian', 'shameful' and 'patronizing' last year - but yesterday it was claimed all the homeless people have since used the money they earned to find a house.

The participants had MiFi devices similar to this strapped to them which would provide wifi internet access to people on the move at the SXSW festival

According to Front Steps, the Austin homeless shelter that helped BBH Labs run the project, 11 of the 13 participants in the event used the money, sometimes more than $600, to put security deposits down on apartments in Austin.

All of them now have housing, Jennifer Denton of Front Steps said. She told ABC News that although there had been controversy during the 2012 festival, the outcome was worth it.

'There was a lot of discussion at the outset, when the program began, about whether it was taking advantage of the individuals. But the individuals participating were really grateful for the opportunity to be productive and earn a wage, and it had this sustainable result,' Denton said.

The homeless people stood beside conference goers to provide internet via the MiFi devices which connect to the internet via the 4G phone network and offer web access via a wifi network.

The idea was spotted by a New York Times reporter, and swiftly caused outcry.

Technology magazine Wired described the stunt as 'dystopian'.

Tim Carmody wrote that homeless were turned into 'not just walking, talking hotspots, but walking, talking billboards for a program that doesn't care anything at all about them or their future.'

British brand strategist Luke Scheybeler lambasted the idea as 'shameful, hideous, patronising and dehumanising'.

Dusty White told ABC News at the time: 'I've swallowed my pride, at first I was a bit embarrassed about it. But being homeless has given me a different outlook about people.'
