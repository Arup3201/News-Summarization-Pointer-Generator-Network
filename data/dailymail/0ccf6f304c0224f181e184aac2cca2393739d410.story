For many passengers, the dream is to board a plane and turn left into business class.

But a dramatic TV documentary appears to have taken away some of the attraction.

On the Channel 4 show, scientists crashed a Boeing 727 carrying test dummies into the Mexican desert.

Wreckage: The jet smashed into the Mexican desert for the show last month to explore a serious but survivable crash-landing and to find out where people should sit to give themselves the best chance of survival

Smashed up: A team of scientists, pilots and safety experts used crash test dummies to show those at the front of the airliner had the least chance of survival while anyone sitting in seat 7A would have certainly died

They found that those in the back of the plane were more likely to survive the impact.

Online travel agent Sunshine.co.uk 
said more than 400 customers had requested seats at the back of a plane 
since the programme aired.

Spokesman Chris Clarkson said: ‘The programme has certainly had an effect on those who watched it as we’ve seen by the recent 
enquiries from customers panicking about where they’d be sat on the 
plane.

‘Obviously, that’s ultimately something 
you arrange through the airline itself, or at the check-in desk.

'Many 
airlines don’t have designated seats and it just depends on when you get
on the plane.’

Brace position: The jet, which can carry up to 170 passengers, contained only crash-test dummies and dozens of interior cameras to film the sequence

Mr Clarkson 
added: ‘People should remember that plane crashes are rare and try not 
to worry about where they are sat - instead trying to focus on their 
exciting holiday ahead.’

The company also said it had 50 calls from passengers worried about being given seat 7A.

In the test crash, this seat was catapulted 500ft from the plane, which would have meant certain death for an occupant.

It also said there had been a 63 per cent drop in requests for first-class travel.

On the programme, scientists simulated the most common type of aviation accident – a forced landing.

Selection: In a macabre twist to the show last month, people logged into Facebook to 'check-in online' and chose where they would have sat on the flight

A pilot flew the 727 before parachuting out. Scientists then crashed the plane by remote control.

Experts used sensors, cameras and dummies with ‘breakable bones’ to assess the impact on the plane and passengers.

In a macabre twist to the show last 
month, people logged into Facebook to 'check-in online' and chose where 
they would have sat on the flight.

After
the terrifying collision, which ripped off the front of the jet in a 
cloud of sand, debris and twisted metal, they found out if they had died
or survived.

The programme’s conclusion was that 
despite having the best seats and service on the plane, being in first 
or business class makes you less likely to survive a crash landing.

The
experiment was designed for scientists to study the crash-worthiness of
the aircraft's airframe and cabin as well as the impact of crashes on 
the human body.

Smash: A pilot had earlier flown the jet out to the Mexican desert and jumped out before the aircraft was remotely crashed into the ground

It was the first time in almost 30 years a passenger plane was crashed on purpose for a scientific experiment.

The last time was in 1984 when NASA teamed up with the FAA to crash a Boeing 720 into the Mojave Desert in California.

Sanjay Singhal, executive producer of the documentary, said before it aired: 'We felt the time was right to do it again.

'It has never been safer to fly, but we want to use this as an opportunity to provide scientific data that might help to improve passenger safety in those extremely rare cases when a catastrophic aircraft accident does occur.’
