Grapes at a commercial-scale vineyard in London have been harvested for the first time since the Middle Ages.

Bunches of tiny ortega grapes have been picked by volunteers at Forty Hall Vineyard, in Enfield, north London, which sits within views of landmarks such as Canary Wharf and The Shard.

These grapes, with other varieties yet to be picked, will be used to produce still and Champagne-style sparkling white wines.

Capital: A commercial-scale vineyard in London has harvested grapes for the first time since the Middle Ages

Vines: Forty Hall Vineyard, in Enfield, north London has more than 7,000 vines featuring a range of grape varieties

Produce: The vineyard does not have onsite wine-making facilities and the grapes will be processed by organic winemaker Will Davenport, in Sussex

Vineyard manager Sarah Vaughan-Roberts hopes they will one day compete in London's fine dining market alongside more well-known foreign brands.

She said: 'We think our wine would be a real interest to the growing number of foodies in London.

'These are the kind of people who seek out interesting, different and artisan foods that are locally produced.

'We also hope very much that any of the government bodies to do with London, like the government office for London or the mayor's office, will be one day drinking our wine at their functions.'

Enterprise: Vineyard manager Sarah Vaughan-Roberts believes the site could eventually produce between 10,000 and 15,000 bottles a year and become a self-sustainable enterprise

Ms Vaughan-Roberts, who studied 
viticulture after being inspired by a radio programme about vineyards in
New York and Paris, said the first bottle should be ready in 2015 - but
would not speculate on price.

They do not have onsite wine-making facilities and the grapes will be processed by organic winemaker Will Davenport, in Sussex.

They have 7,000 vines - of grape varieties include sauvignon, chardonnay, pinot noir, pinot meunier, autauga and the increasingly popular bacchus.

Organic: The vineyard is totally organic but the Forty Hall is pushing for 'biodynamic' status

Community: Volunteering has been at the heart of the project which prides itself on being a community enterprise

With more than 400 vineyards across the country and traders reporting an increase in sales year-on-year, the English wine industry currently appears to be blossoming.

Wine retailer Majestic recently announced sales of English sparkling wine had trebled last year while many of the major supermarkets now also stock a range of domestic products.

And according to English Wine Producers, the organisation responsible for the marketing and promotion of English and Welsh wine in the UK, the first two months of this year saw record sales.

Meanwhile, this year's spectacular summer has seen vineyards across the country enjoy a bumper harvest.

Ms Vaughan-Roberts believes they 
could eventually produce between 10,000 and 15,000 bottles a year and 
become a self-sustainable enterprise.

One of the wines produced will be an English sparkling wine made in the same way as Champagne.

The project has been funded by a lottery grant and the land was donated by Capel Manor College, the nearby horticultural school.

The vineyard is totally organic but the Forty Hall is pushing for 'biodynamic' status. This is a working practice based on a theory devised by Rudolf Steiner in 1924 - and in elements of lunar cycles and homeopathy.

'It is kind of an organic-plus,' added Ms Vaughan-Roberts, who lives in Hackney and commutes to Forty Hall by public transport.

Volunteering has been at the heart of the project which prides itself on being a community enterprise.
