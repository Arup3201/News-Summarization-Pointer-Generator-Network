The chief of the Amazonian military closed the skies above the stadium to aircraft during England’s match last night because of terrorism fears.

General Ubiratan Poty said: ‘Our legislation allows us to shoot down unidentified planes.’

Forces were on special alert last night, as they will be when the USA plays later in the tournament.

‘There is extra attention for those two teams,’ he added.

Fears: The army chief said the skies above the Arena Amazonia were closed during the England game this evening. Pictured are fans arriving at the stadium ahead of the match surrounded by security

Counter-terrorism units are stationed at arenas across Brazil but are not visible to fans.

Security was stepped up following a series of riots in the city on Thursday.

Demonstrators had been protesting throughout the day against money spent on the tournament in Brazil.

Some threw rocks at the ITV studio - with the pundits, led by host Adrian Chiles, later saying they thought they were being shot at.

On Saturday, the BBC was forced to issue an urgent security warning to its World Cup staff after four youths tried to mug a TV worker outside his hotel.

The victim, described as a ‘consultant’, was surrounded by the gang three minutes after leaving the ITV studios on Copacabana Beach, but bravely fought them off after a scuffle.

It happened as he passed the gates of Girl From Ipanema park, named after the famous song, at 7pm last Sunday.

The location is believed to be close to where Gary Lineker is staying.

Strong defence: Lineker posted this picture of police surrounding the ITV studios on Saturday

The former footballer tweeted a picture of riot police on Saturday lined up outside the BBC studios, writing: ‘Best defence on show this evening, right outside.’

Tighter security checks were promised at World Cup stadiums after Chile fans let off fireworks when their team sealed victory over Australia.

Brazil's organizing committee spokesman Saint-Clair Milesi says it aims to make security 'even more rigorous.'

Milesi says the incident in Cuiaba on Friday 'isn't acceptable for fans and for organizers.'

Chile fans lit fireworks, sending plumes of smoke across the Arena Pantanal pitch, after Jean Beausejour scored in stoppage time of a 3-1 win.

FIFA bans fireworks and flares from stadiums and requires tournament organizers to enforce security checks to prevent fans smuggling them in.

Milesi says organizers met late Friday to discuss how 'to be more rigorous in terms of searches.'
