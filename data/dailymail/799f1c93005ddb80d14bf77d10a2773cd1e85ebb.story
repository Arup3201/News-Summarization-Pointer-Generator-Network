Incredible footage has been captured of the 14 skydivers losing control and crashing into the ocean after being stuck in the middle of an unexpected severe hail storm. 

The petrified divers were ripped out of the sky by wild winds at St Kilda beach on Monday with two victims rushed to hospital and 12 others treated by paramedics after the terrifying crash landings.  

The frightening footage, which looks to be have been taken from a balcony overlooking Port Phillip Bay, shows the divers uncontrollably falling out of the sky as thunder clashes and lightning bolts strike.

Within seconds the diver crashed into the water with huge force

After a 38-degree sunny day, a fierce storm quickly took hold with the skydivers suddenly facing an intense hail storm and violent winds.

The extreme strength of the wind can be heard on the video with the cameraman struggling to hold the camera still while filming as one by one each diver dropped out of the dark sky and hit the rough waters at an almighty force.

Horrified members of the public looked to the sky as the divers plummeted at a rapid pace before being battered across an expansive area of the beach and pier. 

Senior Paramedic Team Manager, Jo Wilton, said that it was a chaotic scene when they arrived.

During the free fall many were blown across the sky like rag dolls, lucky to escape with only minor injuries.

The first two survivors were found on the pier just after 3pm and were treated by Metropolitan Fire Brigade marine firefighters.

‘They were all incredibly lucky. Witnesses say they hit the water or the ground really hard so it could have been a lot worse than what it was,’ Senior Paramedic Team Manager Jo Wilton said.

It’s understood that two people were sent to Albert Hospital, while others were treated at the scene, administered with pain relief and treated for welts and soreness, primarily caused by the hail storm.

‘It would have been very frightening for those involved, but they were well cared for at the scene and kept calm.’
