It's cause for celebration for us norms when the celebrity fashion pack adopt a trend that happens to be comfortable as well as cool.

And it just so happens that the stars have aligned in that way this season, as the trendsetters of the celebrity world are ditching skyscraper heels in their droves and embracing the flats.

But of course, these are no ordinary flats. The shoe of choice for the sartorial A-team is none other than the Charlotte Olympia £485 Kitty flat.

Catty: Alexa Chung is a huge fan of Charlotte Olympia's £485 Kitty shoes, wearing them on three recent outings

The velvet shoes come hot on the tail of the current trend for slippers as outerwear - see Penelope Chilvers, Topshop, Asos or Miss Selfridge for evidence.

These though are special - they come with a bold gold heel and a sweet feline face embroidered on the top - complete with tiny ears.

Ardent fan Alexa Chung has been 
spotted wearing hers on three occasions already (and there we were 
thinking celebrities only ever wore things once), while Sarah Jessica 
Parker sported hers for the school run.

The £485 Kitty flats are selling out fast

Katy
Perry paired her cat flats with Moschino's Cheap & Chic telephone
box dress, while model Poppy Delevigne wore a pair in claret velvet on various occasions - once for a prowl around Paris; another time to stalk the shows at London 
Fashion Week, and by night to
attend the Matthew Williamson after-party by night.

First to wear the shoes though, 
naturally, was Charlotte Dellal, the designer behind the Charlotte 
Olympia label (and elder sister of model Alice Dellal).

She paired hers with a cutesy collar, loose shorts, a chunky knit and fishnet tights - the antithesis to SJP's dressed-down 
boyfriend jeans and jumper look.

In doing so, Charlotte proved that this is one kitty who can 
roll with the fashion punches.

The versatile shoe is ideal for 'day to night', the Charlotte Olympia website suggests, thanks to its bold gold heel (the 0.5mm heel is embellished with a metallic finish).

This burgeoning trend for a high fashion low heel will be a blessed relief for many women who are fed up of the ever-increasing heel height imposed upon them by designers - who are usually male.

Thankfully for womankind - and her bunions - this season has seen a proliferation of flats that are slowly taking over from the six inch heels shoe shops have been slaves to for the past few years.

The shoes - available from the Charlotte Olympia website in either black or leopard print - are fast selling out - net-a-porter have reported they are down to their last few pairs - so if you're keen to join team feline, get in quick.
