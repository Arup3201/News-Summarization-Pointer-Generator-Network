The former intelligence worker who was the source of bombshell stories on top secret government snooping programs first approached the Washington Post with his trove of information in early May, the Post's Barton Gellman has reported. 

But the Post refused to fulfill some of Edward Snowden's specific requests, so Snowden took his information to The Guardian's Glenn Greenwald, who then became the first to publish a story on the leaks.

In talks with the Post during the week of May 20, Snowden, 29, had insisted that the newspaper publish within 72 hours the full text of a 41-slide PowerPoint presentation describing PRISM, the surveillance program that collected Internet data from major Silicon Valley companies.

Whistleblower: Edward Snowden first approached the Washington Post with his leaks about government surveillance programs in early May

'I told him we would not make any guarantee about what we published or when,' Gellman reported, to which Snowden replied: 'I regret that we weren't able to keep this project unilateral.'

That's when Gellman says Snowden, a former NSA analyst and Booz Allen Hamilton employee, contacted The Guardian and began working with Greenwald.

The Post broke the story on PRISM two weeks later, on Thursday, after consulting with government officials about the potential harm to national security of publishing the information.

The newspaper eventually reprinted only four of the 41 PRISM PowerPoint slides.

The Post's article came just one day 
after The Guardian broke its story on Snowden's leaks about the National
Security Administration's monitoring of Verizon customers' call data.

Less than a week later, Snowden, who 
referred to himself by the codename 'Verax' in correspondence with 
reporters, has revealed his identity in an exclusive interview with 
Greenwald from a Hong Kong hotel room where he is hiding out to avoid 
prosecution by the U.S. government.

'I understand that I will be made to suffer for my actions,' Snowden told The Guardian on Sunday. 'I will be satisfied if the federation of secret law, unequal pardon and irresistible executive powers that rule the world that I love are revealed even for an instant.'

Hong Kong has an extradition treaty with the U.S. Snowden says he is planning to apply for asylum, possibly in Iceland, to avoid prosecution for the leaks.

He said he had to go public because he could not 'allow the U.S. government to destroy privacy, Internet freedom and basic liberties for people around the world with this massive surveillance machine they're secretly building.'

Snowden has been in Hong Kong since May 20 after leaving his job with defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton, where he had been working for just three months, and claiming that he was seeking treatment for epilepsy.
