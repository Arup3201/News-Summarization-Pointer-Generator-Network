Glen Hulley thought he had experienced the world when he worked with the Australian police force but after a trip to South-East Asia, he started to question his priorities in life.

The 39-year-old  went on a relaxing holiday last year but it unexpectedly changed when he was exposed to extreme poverty, child prostitution and child sexual abuse.

The former Victorian policeman and detective told Daily Mail Australia that his travelling turned into a life-changing experience and realised he needed to help these children and keep them safe.

'I was travelling through Jakarta when a group of middle-aged women approached me and asked if I was interested in  'sexual services' from underage kids,' he said.

'I've seen a lot of things in my life but from what I witnessed after that trip, it has changed my whole perception and I started questioning my values and what would make me happy and fulfilled. 

'We are really lucky here and we do take things for granted, which is why I think these people need help and I know I have a set of skills to do this.'

Following the six-week trip, the Melbourne man said he started looking at ways to make a contribution and help vulnerable and exploited children

Following the six-week trip, the Melbourne man said he started looking at ways to make a contribution and help vulnerable and exploited children.

'I have sold my home, business and car - pretty much everything I own in order to contribute to this important cause,' he said.

'The hardest thing I will leave behind would definitely be my  sons - Ryan, six, and Matthew, four, as well as my partner Meaghan Adams.

'But I have set up a fundraising page to help maintain my relationships and contribute to their well-being when I'm working overseas.'

The father of two has set up a gofundme page after he accepted the job, which pays $18,000 a year as a regional project coordinator of Project Watch.

Glen Hulley hopes the fundraising page will help maintain his relationship with his sons - Ryan, 6, and Matthew, 4, and partner Meaghan Adams living in Australia

Project Watch will work across India, Nepal, Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines to bust child sex rings, stop convicted paedophiles that operate and crime groups trafficking children

'It would be enough for me to live off in South-East Asia but I'm hoping the money raised will also help me pay airfares to fly home each month to see my family, which will in turn allow me to provide focus and sustained support to a program that will deliver strong outcomes in the fight against child exploitation,' he said.

Project Watch will work across India, Nepal, Cambodia, Indonesia and the Philippines to bust child sex rings, stop convicted paedophiles that operate and crime groups trafficking children.

'We will work together to create quality evidence for police to arrest these people.

'We have a system in place to take care of those things here in Australia - doing things to minimise crime and dealing with the aftermath but over in Asia, there is simply no system.

'Offenders can pay their way out of trouble and most victims don't report crime because they know the police won't do anything unless they pay money.'

The relaxing holiday with his partner Meaghan Adams last year has been a life-changing experience

Mr Hulley said he will be in charge of the project and will manage 10 offices with active investigators in many locations that have been identified as 'hot spots' and problem locations for 'child sex tourism', child prostitution and child sexual abuse.

'The project took about 12 months to organise and made it all possible.  

The three year funded project will train and enhance the investigative skills and evidence gathering techniques of local private investigators and educators tasked with reporting, analysing and investigating on all known incidents of child sexual exploitation. 

'By donating to my cause, you are enabling me to make a significant impact on the safety and well-being of children across some of the most high-risk areas of the world,' he said.
