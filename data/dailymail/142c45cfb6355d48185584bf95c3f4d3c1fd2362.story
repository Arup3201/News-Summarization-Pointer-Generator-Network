A brave surfer has revealed how he was sent 'flying' by a great white shark that attacked him from underneath while surfing with friends off the South Australian coast on Wednesday.

Andrew 'Monkey' McLeod was thrown into the air by the pointer on South Australia's West Coast while he was catching waves with two friends - and the shark left its mark on his board.

Mr McLeod, Tyrone Swan and Sam Jervis had just paddled out 2km off shore on the Elliston Bar, when the shark attacked around 9.30am.

The 35-year-old revealed how the great white left two huge bite marks and blood stains on his board but thankfully did not harm him.

'I just felt this massive force and heard this massive sound,' he told Adelaide Now.

Mr McLeod, a pharmacist, added: 'I went flying and Ty thinks that the shark might have totally breached the surface because there was a huge splash.

'After I climbed back on my board I saw its tail fin right next to me and it must have been five foot high. I'd say the shark was 15 foot long. I yelled out "it's a pointer!".'

Survivors: Mr McLeod was surfing with his friends Tyrone Swan and Sam Jervis, who made sure they all paddled back to shore together safely

The three friends quickly hatched a plan for their safe escape.

Mr Swan and Mr Jervis waited for Mr McLeod to paddle over to them before they began a terrifying long paddle back to shore as a group.

Despite his close call, Mr McLeod and his friends have promised to surf again - but perhaps not in the same area.

Elliston is a seaside town which boasts spectacular rugged coastline and picturesque cliff tops.

It is also the place where 17-year-old Port Lincoln surfer Jevan Wright was killed in 2000 while surfing at Blackfellows.

However, although shark attacks seem common, the chances of encountering one in Australia are still relatively rare.

There have been 892 shark attacks in Australia since records began in 1791, according to the Australian Shark Attack File, kept by researchers at Sydney's Taronga Conservation Society.

And just 217 of those recorded attacks have been fatal.
