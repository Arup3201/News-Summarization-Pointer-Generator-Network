A wealthy Russian oligarch has lost a bitter legal battle against his ex-wife to win a 50 per cent share of her £40million London home.

Vladimir Slutsker has been involved in a lengthy court fight to gain what he claimed was his share of the house he and Olga Slutsker bought in The Boltons, South Kensington, through an offshore trust account in 2000.

The pair bought the home in the capital's second most expensive street for just £6million and spent another £1.5million converting it from four luxury apartments to a lavish family home.

Legal battle: Vladimir and Olga Slutsker have been embroiled in a lengthy High Court row over the right to her £40million London mansion

But despite the value of the property 
rocketing in the ensuing decade leading up to the couple's acrimonious 
divorce, Mr Slutsker will not see a penny of the pair's investment.

A
High Court ruling emphasised that the super-rich must live with 
the consequences if they choose to own their homes through offshore 
trusts.

Successful investor
and former Russian politician Mr Slutsker and his wife, who set up a 
chain of exclusive health clubs in her native country, bought the house 
when Mrs Slutsker wished to relocate to London to give 14-year-old son 
Misha a top-class English education.

The
investment vehicle, owned by a Cayman Island's trust - dubbed the 
'Misha trust' after their son - is said to have been set up for the 
benefit of the couple and their children.

Mrs
Slutsker lived at the house with her son and her husband was a regular 
visitor with the pair having another child, Anna, in 2003.

But battle lines were drawn over ownership of the house when the couple divorced in 2009.

Mrs
Slutsker - who was named as 'settlor' of the trust - exercised her 
right to get her husband excluded as a beneficiary so that he had no 
interest at all in the house.

But Mr Slutsker has fought his 
ex-wife’s move every inch of the way, insisting that he is entitled to a
half-share of the property. He has also launched proceedings in the 
Cayman Islands in which he is seeking reinstatement as a beneficiary of 
the trust.

Under Russian 
family law, he insisted that - regardless of the trust - he should be 
recognised as 50 per cent beneficial owner of the house as the couple’s 
joint money had been used to buy it.

However,
dismissing his pleas, Lord Justice Lloyd said that Mr Slutsker had 
consented to the creation of the trust with his eyes open and was bound 
to suffer the consequences.

The judge, sitting with Lord Justice 
Patten and Lady Justice Black, acknowledged that Mr Slutsker did not 
know the finer details of the trust and did not realise that his rights 
as a beneficiary could be 'extinguished' on his wife’s say-so.

Hearing: A ruling at the High Court today emphasised that the super-rich must live with the consequences of buying property through overseas trust funds

But he was aware that the house was being bought through a trust and that the ownership structure was inconsistent with straightforward Russian law principles of joint family property. He knew enough about what was happening to give his 'effective consent' to it, the judge ruled.

Ruling that Mr Slutsker’s arguments were simply ‘wrong’ under both English and Russian law, the judge said he had in any event left it too late to challenge the ownership structure.

After an earlier hearing in the dispute, High Court judge, Mr Justice Underhill, accepted that Mr Slutsker’s exclusion from any interest in the house 'may seem harsh', as much of the money used to buy it having been generated from his business.

However, he said it had never been Mr Slutsker’s intention to use the house as his primary home and his ex-wife’s continued occupation of the house, with their children, was consistent with the former couple’s intentions at the time of the purchase.
