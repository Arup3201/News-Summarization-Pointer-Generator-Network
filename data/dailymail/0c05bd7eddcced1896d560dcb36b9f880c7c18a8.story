We often think of emoticons arriving with the invention of text speak - when people first started to send messages using mobile phones and in emails.

But the first emoticon – specifically the smiley face – could have been used much earlier.

Literary critic Levi Stahl came across a poem written in 1648 which includes what could be the first possible use of the smiley face emoticon, or ':)'.

Emoticon or typo? Literary critic Levi Stahl came across a poem written by English civil ar poet Robert Herrick in 1648 which includes what could be the first possible use of ':)'. The possible emoticon appears in the second line of his poem, 'To Fortune' (pictured)

The questionable emoticon appears in the second line of English civil war poet Robert Herrick's verse, entitled ‘To Fortune’.

The first couple of lines read:  ‘Tumble me down, and I will sitUpon my ruins, (smiling yet:)’

He wanted to know whether the mark was a typo in his poetry book 'Hesperides' so he checked it against a two-volume version of Herrick’s poetry published by Oxford University Press last year. He found that the ‘emoticon’ is included.

The literary critic explained Herrick's poetry is rich in wit, so it's possible that the smiley face was used deliberately. An illustration of the poet's bust is pictured

Mr Stahl wrote on his blog: ‘Herrick's poetry is rich in wit, so it's not entirely out of the bounds of possibility that this is something more than a punctuational oddity.’

If the mark is deliberately made to show a smile, it would predate another ‘emoticon’ by some two hundred years.

That emotional piece of punctuation was found in a New York Times transcript of one of Abraham Lincoln’s speeches in 2009, according to the newspaper’s City Room blog.

It reads: FELLOW CITIZENS: I believe there is no precedent for my appearing before you on this occasion, [applause] but it is also true that there is no precedent for your being here yourselves, (applause and laughter ;) and I offer, in justification of myself and of you, that, upon examination, I have found nothing in the Constitution against. [Renewed applause.]

However, writing in the New Atlantis, which describes itself as a 'journal of technology and society',  Alan Jacobs says: 'I hate to be a party pooper — no, really: I hate it — but I just don't think Levi Stahl has found an emoticon in a seventeenth-century poem — nor, for that matter, that Jennifer 8. Lee found one from 1862.’

Emoticons such as smiley and sad faces are changing the way our brain works, Australian researchers have claimed.

They say the use of the punctuation faces trigger parts of the brain usually reserved for looking at real faces.

They believe this may be the key to their popularity - as we process them as a real face.

'Emoticons are a new form of language that we're producing,' Dr Owen Churches of the school of psychology at Flinders University in Adelaide told ABC News.

'And to decode that language we've produced a new pattern of brain activity.'

The researchers say that we pay more attention to faces than most other things we see as we try to 'read' them for emotion.

The team wanted to see if this was the case with emoticons. They showed 20 participants images of real faces, smiley face emoticons and a meaningless string of characters.

They used electrophysiology to determine the pattern of electrical activity in the brain when the participants viewed the different images, and found we react to emoticons ion the same way.

'There is no innate neural response to emoticons that babies are born with. Before 1982 there would be no reason that ':-)' would activate face sensitive areas of the cortex but now it does because we've learnt that this represents a face," said Dr Churches.

'This is an entirely culturally-created neural response. It's really quite amazing.'

He said: ‘If we were really serious 
about finding out whether Robert Herrick had used an emoticon, we’d look
 for his manuscripts - since we could never be sure that his printers 
had carried out his wishes accurately, especially in those days of 
highly variable printing practices.’

He
 looked up a 19th century version of the work and found that there was 
no ‘emoticon’. But as the original manuscripts are not available, the 
mark may remain a mystery.

However, despite literary spots, Scott Fahlman, of Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, wrote in a blog post: 'Yes, I am the inventor of the sideways 'smiley face' (sometimes called an emoticon) that is commonly used in e-mail, chat, and newsgroup posts.  Or at least I’m one of the inventors.'

According to the professor, they came to be used in the early 1980s among the computer science department's online bulletin boards where a mixture of serious and jokey messages were posted.

'In at least one case, a humorous remark was interpreted by someone as a serious safety warning,' he writes.

'Some people suggested marking posts to show that they were not serious. Various 'joke markers'  were suggested and in the midst of that discussion it occurred to me that the character sequence :-) would be an elegant solution,' he said.

'In the same post, I also suggested the use of :-( to indicate that a message was meant to be taken seriously, though that symbol quickly evolved into a marker for displeasure, frustration, or anger.'

Professor Fahlman said that the convention caught on quickly around the university and soon spread to other institutions and research labs via primitive computer networks.
