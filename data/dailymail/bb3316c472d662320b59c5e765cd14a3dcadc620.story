The friend and mentor of Bali Nine drug smuggler Myuran Sukumaran says the 33-year-old is no longer sleeping as he waits with dread for a final knock on his door to take him to his execution by firing squad.

Artist Ben Quilty, who said goodbye to Sukumaran at Kerobokan prison in Bali for the last time on Thursday, explained the process has begun for Sukumaran and Andrew Chan's imminent execution.

'He knows someone will knock on his door in the middle of the night. I offered to bring him valium but he said "no". He is completely free from drugs and won't even take sleeping pills,' Quilty told ABC radio.

The Australian artist, who in 2011 won the Archibald Prize, has been Sukumaran's mentor since 2012, helping him develop a talent for painting. 

Chan and Sukumaran were leaders of the so-called Bali Nine, who were found guilty of attempting to smuggle more than 8 kg of heroin valued at about $4 million from Indonesia to Australia in 2005.

They were arrested at Bali's Denpasar airport and their case has taken on enormous resonance as a domestic political issue in Australia.

Sukumaran has begun what may well be his final painting after finding a photo of the Indonesian island where he will likely be shot and killed.

'He's found an image of the island where his execution will take place and wants to make a painting. I hope it's not the last he makes but it's the beginnings of a great painting,' Quilty said.

Sukumaran has been on death row for almost ten years but Quilty, who has been leading the Mercy Campaign for the Bali Nine pair, said on Thursday his spirits were high after Foreign Minister Julie Bishop and Deputy Labor leader Tanya Plibersek pleaded for their lives to be spared in parliament.

But later in the day, events took a turn for the worse and their moods plummeted when it was confirmed permission had been granted to move them from Kerobokan prison, setting the wheels in motion for their death.

'By the afternoon things had gone dark, it was very bleak leaving them there,' Quilty said.

'We thought he'd be fine. I said one day we'd be sat on a veranda out in the bush smoking a pipe and drinking vodka together, now that looks like it will never happen.'

Quilty explained yesterday was the first time Sukumaran let out a tear when he said goodbye to his friend.

'The inevitability of it is brutal. He handled it better than I did.' 

A meeting on Thursday granted permission to move the Bali Nine drug smugglers on a date which will be determined on Friday.

Australia's efforts to stop the executions have so far failed, along with desperate legal bids.

Barrister Julian McMahon says for now, his clients are still alive, so efforts to keep it that way continue.

On Wednesday, the Indonesian Administrative Court received a challenge of President Joko Widodo's decision to refuse clemency to all 64 drug offenders on death row.

His decrees state the decision comes 'after thoroughly considering the clemency application'.

But Mr McMahon says this is untrue.

'All of the public statements from the Indonesian government made it clear that the applications would be refused because they were drug offenders,' he said.

'That policy prevented careful consideration, indeed any consideration of the particular cases.'

The lawyers argue it would be a grave miscarriage of justice for the executions to proceed before the court determines whether the decision to refuse clemency is in accordance with the law.

However, Indonesia's Attorney-General HM Prasetyo, who hasn't shied away from commenting on the men's cases before the courts, says he won't delay with his execution plans.

Chan and Sukumaran are expected to be moved to Nusakambangan, a prison island off central Java known as 'Indonesia's Alcatraz'.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported that it understood officials have been speaking to airport authorities and Garuda - the national carrier - which has apparently agreed to fly the men to the place where the executions will take place. 

They will be given 72 hours notice of their execution by firing squad.

Their Sydney families are in Bali, where they have spent the past three weeks paying daily visits to the men in Kerobokan jail.

Over the past decade they've been imprisoned there, Chan and Sukumaran have transformed into model inmates, who have helped scores of others rehabilitate and get drug-free.

The execution process awaiting Chan and  Sukumaran has been described as cruel by a witness to a previous one.  

In the dead of night in 2008, in a remote clearing on the Indonesian island of Nusakambangan, Nigerian nationals Samuel Iwuchukwu Okoye and Hansen Antonious Nwaolisa were executed by firing squad after being sentenced to death for smuggling more than 3kg of heroin each.

It took seven minutes before the two condemned men strapped to wooden crosses bled out on the jungle floor. .

An account given in 2008 by Irish Catholic priest Charlie Burrows, who was at the executions of Okoye and Nwaolisa, says their deaths were neither quick nor painless; they were tortured, 'moaning again and again for seven minutes', as they slowly died.

'I think it is cruel, the torture,' he said at the time in testimony before Indonesia's Constitutional Court.

Okoye and Nwaolisa had been strapped to crucifixes with inner-tubes. Black hoods were placed over their heads.

'It was simple: one, two, three, then bang,' Father Burrows said.

Both men have vowed that their time in jail has rehabilitated them and they deserve a reprieve 

'The blood came out slowly; they were in pain. After 10 minutes, a doctor came to inspect them and pronounced them dead.'

If executed like Okoye and Nwaolisa, the two Australians will have their hands and feet shackled before being taken from their cells before midnight and driven to a remote execution site.

They will be given stark choices: die standing, sitting or kneeling.

If necessary, they will be tied to a pole and will have the choice of being blindfolded.

Twelve executioners with rifles - three of them with live rounds - will be told to aim at targets over their hearts.

'Executions are not clean killings,' their Australian lawyer, Julian McMahon, told AAP in January.

'What, in fact, happens is that the prisoner is taken out into the bush. It's usually at night. If necessary, they are tied to a plank.

'If the prisoner isn't dead straight away, the commanding officer is meant to walk up and then put a bullet in the head.'

Sukumaran and Chan will be executed together.
