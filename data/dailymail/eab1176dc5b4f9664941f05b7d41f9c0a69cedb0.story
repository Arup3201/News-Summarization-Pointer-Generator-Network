Christian Eriksen is set to become the youngest Dane to win 50 caps after he was named in the squad by manager Morten Olsen on Tuesday ahead of friendlies against the United States and France.

The 23-year-old Tottenham midfielder should reach the 50 international milestone at a younger age than previous record holder Michael Laudrup.

The Spurs playmaker made his debut in March 2010, becoming the youngest Dane to play for the national side since Michael Laudrup and the fourth youngest ever.

Eriksen has currently played for the national side 49 times since making his debut in March 2010

During his 49 caps so far Eriksen has only scored one competitive goal with his other four strikes coming in friendlies, and the former Ajax man has often been criticised for his performance for Denmark.

Captain Daniel Agger, defender Lars Jacobsen and midfielder William Kvist were named in the squad despite having been involved in a bitter dispute with the Danish FA (DBU) over a collective bargaining agreement.

Negotiations to resolve the dispute, which concerns payments and bonuses to men's, women's and Under-21 international teams, are ongoing, the DBU said.
