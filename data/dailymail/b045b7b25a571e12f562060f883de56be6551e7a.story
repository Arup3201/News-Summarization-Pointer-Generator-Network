Divers in Australia have captured rare images of the Pyrostremma spinosum, or pyrosome, sea creature off the coast of Tasmania.

It is so rare it has been dubbed the 'Unicorn of the Sea' and can grow up to 30 metres long - the equivalent of two double-decker buses laid end-to-end.

Its hollow, translucent, cylindrical body is made up of thousands of tiny clones called zooids that pull water through its tubes and feed on plankton before pushing the filtered water back out.

Divers from the Eaglehawk Dive Centre in Australia, including Michael Baron, have captured rare images of the Pyrostremma spinosum sea creature, pictured, that can reach 30 metres in length. Its translucent cylindrical body is made up of thousands of tiny filter-feeding creatures called zooids

The zooids are each connected by tissue and move as one inside the pyrosome's tube structure and each zooid is a few millimetres in size.

Also called a sea squirt, the pyrosomes are classed as pelagic, which means they are free-swimming and live in open water rather than near land.

This means they are rarely spotted and only diving groups are likely to catch a glimpse of the giant creatures.

The long tube consists of a pointed end with a hole on the other that can be as wide as two metres.

Each pyrosome feasts on
 plankton and according to Rebecca Helm from Deep Sea News, it is a cross between the Borg in 
‘Star Trek’ and a clone in ‘Star Wars.’

Helm said: 'They’re giant, terrifying looking, and trolling through the depths of the ocean, waiting for you to swim in one end and get stuck.  Maybe. But fortunately, in addition to being slow moving filter feeders, they’re also delicate and fluffy.'

The pyrosome is so delicate one diver is said to have even described it like a feather boa.

Pyrosomes usually live in the upper layers of the open ocean in warm seas, although some are found a bit deeper.

Pyrosomes are cylindrical-shaped colonies made up of  thousands of individuals, known as zooids.

Colonies can be less than one centimetre up to several metres in length.

Each zooid is a few millimetres in size and are each connected by tissue and move as one inside the pyrosome's tube structure.

Pyrosomes are classed as planktonic. This means their movements are mainly controlled by currents, tides and waves in the oceans.

Michael Baron from from Eaglehawk Dive Centre recorded the footage of the giant creature off the Tasman Peninsula in Tasmania, Australia.

He said it was one of the few areas in the world where a wide range of 'oceanic gelatinous plankton' comes close to shore.

Baron also managed to film salps that are similar to pyrosomes but the individuals inside it are much larger than the zooids inside the pyrosome.

According to Eaglehawk Dive Centre's YouTube page: 'Salps have much larger individuals than 
pyrosomes, individuals pump water through themselves.

'Colonies are 
formed of chains of individuals. Salps can form very high densities 
under good conditions, and are an important oceanic food source for 
fish.
