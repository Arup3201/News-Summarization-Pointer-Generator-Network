Defying the Republican-run Congress, President Barack Obama rejected a bill Tuesday to approve construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, wielding his veto power for only the third time in his presidency.

Obama offered no indication of whether his State Department will eventually issue a permit for the pipeline, whose construction has become a flashpoint in the U.S. debate about environmental policy and climate change.

Instead, Obama sought to reassert his authority to make the decision himself, rebuffing GOP lawmakers who will control both the House and Senate for the remainder of the president's term.

President Barack Obama, seen here during a meeting with Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani at Oval Office of the White House on Tuesday, formally vetoed legislation approving construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline this afternoon

'The presidential power to veto legislation is one I take seriously,' Obama said in a brief notice delivered to the Senate. 'But I also take seriously my responsibility to the American people.'

Obama vetoed the bill in private with no fanfare, in contrast to the televised ceremony Republican leaders staged earlier this month when they signed the bill and sent it to the president. 

House Speaker John Boehner said Republicans were 'not even close' to giving up the fight and derided the veto as a 'national embarrassment.'

The move sends the politically charged issue back to Congress, where Republicans haven't shown they can muster the two-thirds majority in both chambers needed to override Obama's veto. 

North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, the bill's chief GOP sponsor, said Republicans are about four votes short in the Senate and need about 11 more in the House. 

Still, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated that he would try to bring more Democrats over to his party's side on the issue in an attempt to overturn Obama's veto by March 3.

'Even though the President has yielded to powerful special interests, this veto doesn’t end the debate,' McConnell said. 'Americans should know that the new Congress won’t stop pursuing good ideas, including this one.'

Although the veto is Obama's first since Republicans took control on Capitol Hill, it was not likely to be the last. 

GOP lawmakers are lining up legislation rolling back Obama's actions on health care, immigration and financial regulation that Obama has promised to similarly reject.

'He's looking at this as showing he still can be king of the hill, because we don't have the votes to override,' Republican Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma, a vocal opponent of Obama's climate change agenda, said in an interview with the Associated Press. 'If he vetoed this, he's going to veto many others that are out there.'

First proposed more than six years ago, the Keystone XL pipeline project has sat in limbo ever since, awaiting a permit required by the federal government because it would cross an international boundary. The pipeline would connect Canada's tar sands with refineries on the Texas Gulf Coast that specialize in processing heavy crude oil.

Republicans and the energy industry say the $8 billion project would create jobs, spur growth and increase America's independence from Mideast energy sources. 

Democrats and environmental groups have sought to make the pipeline a poster child for the type of dirty energy sources they say are exacerbating global warming.

'This misguided Keystone XL bill, pushed by the fossil fuel industry, has met its just and expected doom,' Rhea Suh, president of the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement following news of Obama's veto.

'The president got it exactly right,' she said. 'Congress should stop wasting any more time pushing dirty energy projects that would worsen climate change and threaten our air, water and land.' 

On behalf of Friends of the Earth, the organization's president, Erich Pica, also thanked Obama for striking down the Keystone legislation.

'The veto sends a strong message to Congress that the government should represent the interests of the American people instead of Big Oil.'

House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, seated, held a public ceremony to sign the bill authorizing expansion of the Keystone XL pipeline just before Congress left for a week-long recess on Feb. 13. Republicans did not send the legislation to Obama until Tuesday, however. He quickly vetod it in private. It was only the third veto of Obama's presidency

For his part, Obama says his administration is still weighing the pipeline's merits, and he has repeatedly threatened to veto any attempts by lawmakers to make the decision for him.

The president's spokesman told reporters today that the veto was not the president taking 'a specific position on the pipeline itself.' Rather, it is him handing off the decision to experts within the administration.

'It does not represent a final disposition of the Keystone project,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. 

In a statement to Congress today explaining his veto, Obama said he was opposing the bill because 'this act of Congress conflicts with established executive branch procedures and cuts short thorough consideration of issues that could bear on our national interest -- including our security, safety, and environment.' 

That message was all but lost on Republicans, who accused Obama in a barrage of attacks on Tuesday, of playing politics and kowtowing to environmental groups. 

Recently elected Georgia Sen. David Perdue called the president's veto 'ridiculous.' Louisiana's senior senator, David Vitter, contended that the move was 'just sheer political spite.' 

The Senate GOP Conference sent reporters an email blasting Obama as the 'obstructor in chief.'

'There is simply no reason whatsoever for the president not to approve this project that will create thousands of jobs for American workers and put our country one step closer to energy independence,' Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander said.

Texas Rep. Bill Flores said Obama was putting the 'priorities of radical environmentalists ahead of the needs and priorities of hardworking American families.

'President Obama's veto is a triumph of politics over common sense,' Pennsylvania Rep. Lou Barletta said. 

'His own State Department completed five reviews, totaling more than 22,000 pages, and concluded that the Keystone XL Pipeline is a project that will create jobs, and actually improve safety and the environment.

'The only possible reason to oppose the project is politics,' he concluded.

The president's spokesman told reporters today that the veto was not the president taking 'a specific position on the pipeline itself.' Rather, it is him handing off the decision to experts within the administration

The GOP-controlled House passed the bill earlier in February on a 270-152 vote, following weeks of debate and tweaks in the Senate to insert language stating that climate change is real and not a hoax. 

Republican leaders in Congress delayed sending the bill to the White House until they returned from a weeklong recess, ensuring they would be on hand to denounce the president when he vetoed the bill.

The veto forced Republicans, still reveling in their dramatic gains in the midterm elections, to confront the limitations of being unable to turn their ideas into law without the president's consent - despite the fact they now control both chambers of Congress.

Republican leaders were mulling a number of potential next steps. In addition to trying to peel off enough Democrats to override Obama's veto - an unlikely proposition - Republicans were considering inserting Keystone into other critical legislation dealing with energy, spending or infrastructure in hopes that Obama would be less likely to veto those priorities, Hoeven, said.

'We'll look to see if we can get some more bipartisan support,' the North Dakota lawmaker noted.

Obama last wielded his veto power in October 2010, nixing a relatively mundane bill dealing with recognition of documents notarized out of state. 

With the Keystone bill, Obama's veto count stands at just three - far fewer than most of his predecessors. Yet his veto threats have been piling up rapidly since Republicans took full control of Congress, numbering more than a dozen so far this year.

The president has said he won't approve Keystone if it's found to significantly increase U.S. emissions of carbon dioxide, the chief greenhouse gas blamed for global warming. 

A State Department analysis found that the tar sands would be developed one way or another, meaning construction of the pipeline wouldn't necessarily affect emissions. 

The Environmental Protection Agency earlier this month called for that analysis to be revisited, arguing that a drop in oil prices may have altered the equation.

The White House had said many times that the president would not sign the legislation - he believes the State Department should make the decision

Keystone backers do not make up a large enough majority of the House or Senate to overturn a veto but Republicans plan to try
