Louis van Gaal has been warned by the FA as to his future conduct following comments made about the referee after Manchester United's FA Cup fourth round draw against Cambridge United last month.

The Dutch manager's comments came after last month's goalless draw at the Abbey Stadium and Van Gaal implied that referee Chris Foy was 'against' his side.

He said: ‘We have to come here, the pitch isn’t so good, the opponents always give a lot more than they normally give and defending is always easier than attacking and then you have seen the referee.

Despite the charge Van Gaal, who denied he had brought the game into disrepute, has escaped punishment

Van Gaal was charged by the FA for the comments but on Wednesday it was announced he had escaped punishment and had received just a warning.

'Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing on Wednesday 18 February 2015, Louis van Gaal has been warned as to his future conduct after he was found to have breached FA Rules in relation to media comments,' a statement on the FA's website read.

'The Manchester United manager denied that his comments which followed The FA Cup Fourth Round tie against Cambridge United on 23 January 2015 alleged and/or implied bias on the part of the match referee, and/or brought the game into disrepute.'

The 52-year-old referee Foy was not involved in any major controversies during the game and the FA accused Van Gaal of questioning Foy’s integrity.

An FA statement released earlier this month said: ‘Louis van Gaal has been charged by the FA for media comments he made after Manchester United’s FA Cup Fourth Round match against Cambridge United on Friday 23 January 2015.

‘It is alleged that the Manchester United manager’s comments allege and/or imply bias on the part of the match referee and/or bring the game into disrepute.'
