A drive to get more prisoners working in prison is branded a failure today after figures show there has barely been an increase in four years.

The proportion of inmates working in public sector prisons has risen by just one per cent since the coalition was formed.

And in 30 prisons the figure has fallen, leading Labour to condemn the Tories' get tough message on life in jail as 'just a load of hot air'.

Ministers pledged to get more prisoners working, and not sitting idle in their cells. But there the proportion of inmates working has risen by 1 per cent since 2010

Since 2010 the government has repeatedly vowed to turn prisons into 'places of hard work and industry'.

But new figures released in Parliament show that in 2013-14 just 14 per cent of prisoners were working, up from 13 per cent in 2010-11.

In 2010 the Ministry of Justice declared: 'Prisons will become places of hard work and industry, instead of enforced idleness.

'Hard work for offenders is at the heart of our plans to make punishments more rigorous.

'Prisons should not allow offenders to simply mark their time in a purposeless fashion.

'Rather, prisons should be seen as places where increasing numbers of prisoners are engaged in challenging and meaningful work.'

Tory justice secretary Chris Grayling said in 20102: 'Saving money does not have to mean less work in prison and less training for offenders.

'We will continue to increase the hours prisoners spend in work and training.'

Last year Nick Clegg declared: 'We are putting more and more offenders like him to work in prison every year: making sure he doesn't lie idle in his bed.'

The proportion of prisoners working was lower after four years in 30 prisons, including Stafford, down from 38 per cent to 25 per cent, Guys Marsh prison, down from 30 per cent to 19 per cent, and Cardiff, down from 13 per cent to 9 per cent.

Rochester, Bristol, Dartmoor, Liverpool, Leeds, Pentonville, Wormwood Scrubs and Ford prison also falls.

Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said the promise to put more criminals to work was 'a load of hot air'

Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said: 'Yet again David Cameron fails to deliver and has broken a key promise.

'So much for the rehabilitation revolution David Cameron's government promised.

'Four years ago we were told that criminals would be put to work while in jail, but this data we have uncovered shows it was just a load of hot air.

'Not only are prisons not working, nor are prisoners. Instead of being put to work, or made to go on education and training courses, prisoners are still spending too much time behind bars idling away their days in their cells or prison landings.'

He accused the government of closing down too many jails and laying off too many prison officers.

'Prisons have become overcrowded and violent as a result. None of this will help reduce re-offending, cut the number of innocent victims of crime or make our communities safer.'

Many work in workshops producing items for the outside world, while some help with the upkeep of the prison, cooking food and cleaning.

Justice Minister Andrew Selous said: 'Work in prisons is a key priority to ensure prisoners are engaged in real work whilst they are in custody.

'It also gives them the opportunity to learn skills and a work ethic which can increase their chances of finding employment on release, a key element to reducing reoffending.'

He boasted that the number of prisoners working in public sector prisons increased from around 8,600 in 2010-11 to around 9,900 in 2013-14.

However the prison population has risen over this time, meaning the proportion has barely changed. 

Mr Selous added: 'In that time, an additional four million hours have been worked in public prisons and in 2012-13 (the most recent figure available) a further 1,200 prisoners worked in commercial and industrial workshops in private sector prisons.

'None of these figures include the significant numbers of prisoners who work in keeping prisons clean, maintenance or cooking and serving meals.'
