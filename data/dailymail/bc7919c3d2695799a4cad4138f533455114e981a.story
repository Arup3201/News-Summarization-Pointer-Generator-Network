Boris Johnson denounced ¿humiliated¿ critics of HS2 for pretending they were worried about wildlife and ancient woodlands

Opponents of the HS2 line are worried their house prices will plunge and are hiding behind ‘b*llocks’ environmental concerns, Boris Johnson has said.

The London Mayor waded into the row over the £50 billion project, denouncing its ‘humiliated’ critics for pretending they were worried about wildlife and ancient woodlands.

Mr Johnson’s attack came as David Lidington, the Europe Minister, threatened to quit if generous concessions were not made to constituents affected by the railway.

While some Tory ministers were under pressure from voters to oppose the HS2 Bill at second reading last night, Mr Johnson declared he had always been a fan of big infrastructure.

In a swipe at critics, he told Total Politics magazine: ‘It’s b*llocks. They’re not campaigning for forests, they’re not campaigning for butterflies. They pretend to be obviously, but what they’re really furious about is that their house prices are getting it.’

Mr Johnson added: ‘People are in the humiliating position of having to pretend that there’s some environmental objection that they have, that the great crested grebe is going to be invaded or whatever. What they care about is their house prices. It’s tragic we have protest groups talking about ‘this ancient woodland’ when actually there’s no tree in this country that’s more than 200 years old.’

He added that the average life expectancy of a tree could not be ‘more than 60 years’.

Mr Johnson urged the government to adopt the ‘French approach’ and wave an ‘absolutely massive chequebook’ at concerned residents to buy their homes off them for ‘top dollar’.

‘Then when the whole thing goes in and is a success and generates a movement to the area, lifts the economy and the prices go up, well who’s quids in? The Government,’ he added.

Last night Mr Lidington threatened to resign if the government did not mitigate the impact of the high speed line by building a tunnel under the Chilterns. He was in Estonia last night so missed the vote but insisted he would have abstained anyway.

‘I have decided to abstain, but I have been and remain opposed to HS2, I’ve fought alongside campaigns and the Prime Minister knows my views,’ he told the Bucks Herald newspaper.

‘I will resign at a later stage of the bill if they don’t get mitigation, and that for me includes a Chiltern’s tunnel.’

Mr Lidington defended his decision not to vote against and immediately quit: ‘If I stood down I would just be one more MP that is against HS2, but by staying in I have the inside track, it’s a pragmatic political judgement.’

Tory whips appeared to turn a blind eye on ministerial absences for the vote, with newly promoted Treasury minister Andrea Leadsom also away on urgent business in Brussels, while Attorney General Dominic Grieve was in the north east on a ministerial visit.

Plans for HS2 were expected to pass a Commons hurdle despite a threatened rebellion from dozens of Tories. A poll released by ComRes found that 31 per cent of Conservatives were opposed to HS2.

The same proportion of Labour MPs were also against the London to Midlands and the North line, despite the party officially backing the Bill. Some three in ten Lib Dems were also in favour of abandoning HS2.

Although Labour whipped MPs to vote for the Bill, Ed Balls, the shadow chancellor is still lukewarm on the project. There are suspicions that the party would abandon the project if it got into power, channelling the tens of billions into other pet projects.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin told MPs it was not helpful to call critics of HS2 ‘nimbys’ or Luddites. But he added: ‘This is a decision which we cannot duck. We have waited long enough.

‘Built right, on time and on budget, HS2 can help our great cities thrive... This project deserves careful scrutiny but Britain deserves it to go ahead.’

Work on the line is expected to begin in 2017.
