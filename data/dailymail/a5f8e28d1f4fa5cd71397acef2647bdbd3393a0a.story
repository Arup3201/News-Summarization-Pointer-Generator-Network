It won’t be long until Twitter and Facebook are virtually indistinguishable as the sites continue to borrow features from each other.

The latest swap involves Twitter replacing its iconic 'Retweet' button with a Facebook-style share option.

Twitter users began tweeting about the change last night, and many users were angry with how similar the sites are becoming.

As part of the changes, the Retweet button has been replaced with 'Share with followers' and 'Quote Tweet' is now 'First add comment', pictured. It appears the change is being rolled out gradually. Twitter often experiments with new features but not all get a full release

Previously, when users clicked the arrows button beneath a post they were given the option to Retweet, or Quote Tweet.

Retweet shares the tweet as it is, while Quote Tweet let users edit the tweet before posting it.

Under
 the new changes, the Retweet option has been replaced with ‘Share with 
followers’ and Quote Tweet has been replaced with ‘First add comment.’

Although many websites offer sharing functions, the term has become synonymous among Facebook users.

It
 appears the change is being rolled out gradually and Twitter often 
experiments with new features, but not all get a full release.

The change appeared shortly after Twitter posted a blog announcing a new range of photo options.

One user called Brooke, tweeting under the name @daeHekoorB, said: ‘Wtf Twitter you’re starting to look like Facebook.’

Letti, @Letti4u, continued: ‘Twitter to end retweet? I didn't know going public meant going stupid.’

Users can now add up to four pictures in each tweet – they could only previously add one.

The firm also added the ability to tag up to ten friends in a photo, without using up any of the tweets 140 characters.

The move is seen as another direct move to compete with Facebook and Instagram's photo features.

Earlier this year, Twitter rolled out a new design that was similarly criticised for closely resembling how Facebook profiles look.

The most noticeable change is the size of the cover photo. Twitter added the feature during a redesign in September 2012, five months after Facebook included it as part of its Timeline rejig.

Twitter cover photos now appear full-width along the top of the screen, and the profile picture that used to sit in the centre of this cover image has been moved to the left-hand side.

Images are larger, while text-based tweets are made smaller, and where appropriate, cards are positioned in columns similar to Facebook's Highlights profile design, pictured

Many users will still see the old Twitter layout, pictured, when they log into their desktop account because the new design is being rolled out gradually. The photos and videos box on the old left-hand panel has been removed and a new category tab has been created on the new site to showcase this content

In line with this change, a user's bio that traditionally appeared inside the cover photo has also been moved to below the profile picture.

The left-hand panel has also changed; the photos and videos box has been removed and a new category tab has been created to showcase this content in a user's feed.

Thumbnail pictures of followers have been moved up and Trends have been moved down.

The imitation goes both ways, however  - in June last year, Facebook added the hashtag tool to its site.
