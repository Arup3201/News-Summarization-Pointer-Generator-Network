In the Nineties, Sara Cox gained a reputation for being a loudmouth ladette who enjoyed staying out partying and drinking pints. 

But these days the Radio 2 DJ is more likely to be seen running round the park with her Maltese Terrier, Beano, than falling out of a bar with Zoe Ball.

Sara told MailOnline she couldn't be happier with life as a married mother-of-three and now she prefers hitting the gym rather than a night club.

Sara Cox, pictured with her Maltese Terrier, Beano, said she's fitter and healthier as she turns 40 thanks to taking him for walks and runs, while she also loves hitting the gym 

She said: 'I like feeling fit, I don't drink much anymore unless it's a special occasion. I love the gym buzz I get from a workout.'

She added that she eats healthily and doesn't diet as she wants to promote eating well to her children - Lola, 10, Isaac, six, and Renee, four.

'Once you have kids you need to have broccoli knocking about. You can't have a rock n' roll fridge full of vodka, that's not real life. I eat well and the kids eat well too,' she said,

'But I'm not dieting nibbling on a wafer, you have to be careful about that when you have daughters. I want them to see that I go to the gym and then come back and eat healthily rather than dieting.' 

Sara, who married Ben Cyzer, the father of her two youngest children in 2013, turned 40 last December and admitted she's indifferent to the fuss made over the milestone.

The DJ had a reputation for staying out late drinking in her twenties, pictured right with wine in hand in 1998, but she said now she only drinks on special occasions, pictured left this week with Beano

'Turning 40 is always made a thing of for women, it's quite sexist as it isn't like that for men,' she said.

'I feel like women are made to feel it's a big deal. They should either put on a brave face or rush to Google the nearest Botox clinic.'

For Sara, turning 40 was 'the best birthday I ever had' as she had fun at a party and then went away with her family for a few days where she visited a spa and went horse riding.

She added that age has brought her more self-confidence as well as domestic bliss. 

'My career is going well, I have three healthy kids and a lovely husband so it is easy for me to feel pleased with my lot whether I am 40 or not,' she said. 'I am in happy place, I'm lucky. 

'As you get older, you care less about what people think and have more confidence, I'm also fitter and healthy now.'

Sara, pictured at an event in London this week, said celebrations for her 40th last December were the 'best birthday I ever had' as she had a party and a weekend away with her husband and three children

Now she loves keeping fit, Sara is passionate about keeping her family active too.

She said one of the best ways to do this is for everyone to take Beano for a walk in the park.

'Once you get the kids out the door and to the park they have a brilliant time away from TV and iPad screens,' she said.

Dog lover Sara had Basset Hound Snoop till his death in 2013 and then got Beano - who she loves to take everywhere with her (he's even passed his BBC health and safety test so he can join her at work).

He gets plenty of exercise on family dog walks and joins Sara on a weekly five mile run - but many pets aren't so lucky.

Research has found that almost half (43 per cent) of the UK's dog population is now classed as overweight.

The study by Pedigree found that two thirds of owners with overweight dogs didn't realise their pet's health was at risk because of their size, and more than a third of owners admitted to making excuses for not meeting their dog's recommended levels of exercise.

As a brand ambassador for Pedigree, Sara is now helping them launch their Pedigree Tracks App which gives owners an exercise and eating plan based on their dog's breed, age and weight.

Sara said: 'Some owners can love their dogs too much and give them too many treats. And in the winter it can be hard to get out and take them for a walk. This is a fun way to keep your dog healthy.' 

Sara Cox and her dog Beano are working with Pedigree to launch the new Pedigree Tracks App, a personalised simple and effective tool to help owners understand their dog's exercise and nutritional requirements.
