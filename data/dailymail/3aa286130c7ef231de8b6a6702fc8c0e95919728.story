Roger Federer will no doubt be frustrated to lose to the Serbian, after the thrilling and competitive match on Centre Court this afternoon

Federer took the first set 7-6 (9-7) in 52 minutes before Djokovic won the second

Djokovic, who had lost five of his 
previous six grand slam finals, was staring at a shattering defeat but 
he refused to be beaten and took his second match point to win 
6-7 (7/9) 6-4 7-6 (7/4) 5-7 6-4.

It was the Serbian's seventh grand 
slam title and his second Wimbledon triumph, while Federer will be left 
to wonder whether he will ever get a better chance to win an 18th slam

It
 was only the second time Federer and Djokovic have met in a Grand Slam 
final - Federer won in straight sets at the 2007 U.S. Open.

Djokovic
 fell awkwardly in the first game of the second set and called for a 
trainer immediately after he broke Federer's serve to take a 2-1 lead. 
The trainer worked on Djokovic's left ankle.

Djokovic again called for the trainer after the third game of the final set to have his right calf worked on.

At 30-30, the Serb hit a forehand wide
 to hand Federer his first break point of the match, but swiftly 
regained his concentration to bring up set point with an ace and saw it 
out with a forehand smash.

In
 the third set both players flexed their serving muscles with the ace 
count mounting and neither facing a break point until the 11th game when
 Djokovic began to turn the screw once more.

The
 Serb ground out two break points but Federer again dug in, saving both 
with some precision serving to hold after a series of deuces.

Djokovic finally made the breakthrough
 in the third game of the second set, sweeping a backhand pass beyond 
Federer and breaking the world number four's serve for only the second 
time all tournament.

The 
Serbian called the trainer for treatment to his left ankle after taking a
 heavy fall but there did not appear to be any lasting damage.

Federer
 had one chance to retrieve the break when Djokovic betrayed a few 
nerves serving for the set, but the threat was averted.

This
 was the 35th meeting between the two men but only their second grand 
slam final - the first came back in 2007 at the US Open - and second 
match at Wimbledon.

Federer won both of those clashes, and the third set appeared crucial to his hopes of a repeat.

Federer's
 serving was almost immaculate and there may have been a first for the 
world's best returner in the ninth game as four consecutive aces flew 
past him.

It came to his rescue two games later as Djokovic forced two break points, the Serbian yelling at the chalk dust in frustration.

But in the tie-break Federer's resistance ran out, and his hopes of victory appeared over when he trailed 5-2 in the fourth set.

Having been broken for 3-1, Federer had hit straight back with his first break of the match only to drop serve once more.

But at the biggest moment of the match, Djokovic faltered and back came Federer again, the Swiss breaking serve to trail only 5-4 while his opponent lay sprawled on the ground.

Still it looked like it would not be enough as Djokovic brought up a first match point, but Federer, the man who loathes Hawk-Eye, may revise his opinion after a challenge gave him an ace.

The missed chances must have haunted Djokovic and he handed Federer a second straight break.

Federer duly served out one of the most remarkable sets of his long career.

The momentum was all with Federer, and physically Djokovic was struggling too, taking a medical time-out after the third game of the fifth set for treatment to his right leg.

Federer piled on the pressure in the seventh game and brought up a break point but then netted a backhand.

Djokovic held and suddenly he was the man pushing forward as Federer faced three break points. Each time the Swiss came up with an answer.The third, when he dug a half-volley off his toes, was one of the shots of the championship.

But Djokovic was pressing intensely and two games later he brought up two match points.

This time Federer could not fight back, the Swiss netting a backhand as Djokovic celebrated a hugely emotional victory after three hours and 57 minutes.
