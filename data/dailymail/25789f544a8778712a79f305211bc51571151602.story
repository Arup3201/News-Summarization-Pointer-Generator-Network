It took eight years to build, is 310m tall and will surely drive buyers round the bend to nab an apartment here.

This is Cayan Tower, the world's tallest twisted building - and has finally opened with much fanfare in Dubai.

Built at a cost of around Rs. 1578 crores, the 80-storey residential Cayan Tower is twisted at 90 degrees from top to bottom and boasts 570 plush apartments.

And it look slike the appeal of living in a record-breaking property has already lured in buyers - 80 per cent of its residential units have already been sold, NDTV reported.

The twisting tower is the creation of Skidmore Owings and Merrill, the same team behind the world's tallest tower Burj Khalifa.

It spirals in a smooth curve by 90 degrees to give every apartment a stunning view of the sea or marina.

The architects used open-space architectural concepts to ensure that there are no pillars anywhere in the building.

The team also designed Trump Tower in Chicago and Jin Mao in Shanghai.

The Cayan Tower website boasts about 
the property's location - it was built at the mouth of Dubai Marina - 
and boasts views across the marina, sea and The Palm.

It offers a pool, whirlpool, spa, massage rooms, nursery and gym.

The Burj Khalifa tower, the world's tallest structure, still soars over the twisted building

On a secondary market property website, a one-bedroom apartment carries a price tag of $435,000, CNN reported.

But it is dwarfed by the Burj Khalifa, which at over 828 metres (2,716.5 feet) and more than 160 stories is the tallest skyscraper and tallest free-standing structure in the world.

Other soaring structures to dwarf the Cayan are the 553m-tall CN Tower in Toronto, Canada and the Taipei 101 tower in Taiwan, which measures 501m high.

Another twisting tower is the HSB Turning Torso in Malmo, Sweden. It is the tallest skyscraper in Sweden the tallest building in Scandinavia.

It holds the accolade of being the the third tallest residential building in Europe, reaching 190 metres and boasting 54 storeys containing 147 apartments.
