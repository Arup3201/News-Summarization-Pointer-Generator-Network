Ahead of Mother's Day this weekend, Katie Price has revealed the highs and lows of caring for her disabled son, Harvey. 

The 12-year-old, whose father is former Manchester United footballer Dwight Yorke, has 'Prader-Willi syndrome' (PWS), a rare genetic condition that causes a wide range of problems.

He is on the autism spectrum, has limited vision and can't walk far unaided. Every day, he has to take six types of life-saving medication.

Mother-of-five Katie, 36, said caring for him can be challenging but she has the full support of her own mother, Amy Price, 62, who appeared on today's This Morning with her and Harvey. 

'People say "how do you cope?" but I don't know any different,' Katie told presenters Eammon Holmes and Ruth Langsford. 

'He is hard work, he does play up for mummy sometimes, don't you Harvey,' she said to him, to which he cheekily replied, 'yeah, babe.'

Katie said one of the biggest challenges is controlling Harvey's hunger. A symptom of his condition is a constant desire to eat which can lead to dangerous weight gain.

'He just wants to eat, eat, eat and if we're not looking he will steal food,' Katie said. 'He's a big boy because of his thyroid and with Prader-Willi everything is about food.'

When they go on a family holiday, they have to ensure they are near a hospital 'in case something happens' and daily life can be difficult because Harvey's behaviour is so unpredictable.

But as he approaches his teenage years, Katie said Harvey is also be a delight as his personality shines through.

He loves to play instruments like the piano and drums and to draw. He produced a picture he had made especially for Eammon and Ruth during his appearance on the ITV show.

He told them that he loves listening to music and his favourite song is Adele's Skyfall. 

On his health progress, grandmother Amy said: 'He doesn't have to use a braille machine which is a real bonus because we never thought he would be able to see let alone be able to read.' 

Katie, who won Celebrity Big Brother earlier this year, said she gets a lot of support from her husband Kieran Hayler, 27.

'He is so good with him,' she said of Kieran's relationship with Harvey.

The couple have reconciled after Kieran cheated on Katie last year while she was pregnant with his daughter, Bunny, who was born last August.

They also have a son, Jett, 19 months, while Katie has also two children with ex-husband Peter Andre, Princess, nine, and Junior, seven, as well as Harvey.

The former glamour model said her home will be a 'mad house' this Sunday as they will celebrate Mother's Day together and she will cook for her mother Amy. 

Earlier this year, Katie found herself embroiled in a controversy over using taxpayer's money for the care of Harvey.

During her appearance on Celebrity Big Brother, Katie Hopkins said the multi-millionaire should pay for her son to have a driver to take him to and from school instead of relying on the government.

Harvey currently travels 50 miles daily from his home in West Sussex to south London, after his local specialist school was shut down.

On the show, Katie claimed it would be 'ridiculous' to pay for it herself, suggesting the car could cost as much as £1,000 a day.

She also insisted she pays 'over-the-odd taxes' which should entitle her to the same benefits as other parents.

Earlier this year, Katie, pictured today, had to defend her right to use taxpayers' money to help transport Harvey to and from a school that can meet his needs

In a statement released by her management at the time, she said: 'Where any child that is placed in school out of the immediate home area it is the Local Authorities duty to provide transport that meets the child's needs.

'This is common practice for all disabled children as there are not enough suitable schools available to them.

'The cost of the school placement together with transport is not means tested as it is provided for the child.

'Local Authorities do not have special needs schools locally as these have been closed during the last 15 years as it was deemed a cheaper option to transport children out of borough.

Katie, pictured with husband Keiran at the Cheltenham Festival earlier this week, said he's great with Harvey 

'If Harvey's school was on his doorstep, as with schools for healthy children, then this would not apply but it was the Government's choice to close the special needs schools.'

Meanwhile, on today's This Morning, Katie addressed rumours other whether she will appear on another popular reality TV show - Strictly Come Dancing.  

'I'd love to do Strictly but no-one has asked,' she said.
