Cellphones these days are seemingly more time-consuming for college students than any other activity, finds a new study - and that includes sleeping.

According to a Baylor University study, female college students spend an average of 10 hours a day on their phones, with male students only slightly behind, screen-bound for an average of eight hours.

'That's astounding,' said researcher James Roberts, Ph.D., at the Hankamer School of Business. 'Addictions to this seemingly indispensable piece of technology [are becoming] an increasingly realistic possibility.'

In the study - based on an online survey of 164 college students - 60per cent of participants admitted they may actually be addicted to their cell phones.

Texting took up the most time, an average of 94 minutes a day; followed by sending emails, which took up 48 minutes, checking Facebook, which accounted for 38 minutes, surfing the internet, which took 34 minutes, and listening to their iPods, an average of 26 minutes a day.

Men were found to send the same number of emails as women, though they spent less time firing them off. Perhaps, Dr Roberts says, because men send 'shorter, more utilitarian messages.'

And gone are the days when youths were hooked on games. It's social media portals like Instagram and Pinterest which are most strongly associated with cellphone addiction now, according to Dr Roberts.

The psychological roots of this device dependence could run deep. 'Cellphones may wind up being an escape mechanism from their classrooms,' Dr Roberts says. 

'Some people use a cellphone to dodge an awkward situation. They may pretend to take a call, send a text or check their phones.'

A similar study conducted by Seton Hall University in 2012 yielded similar results. It found that young adults check their phones an average of 60 times per day and send out an average of 3,200 text messages per month.

Researchers noted that impulsiveness of this kind is a well-known component of substance addictions. Indeed, many participants in the Baylor study agreed with the statement: 'I get agitated when my cellphone is not in sight.'

Country crooner Carrie Underwood has admitted: 'My cellphone is my best friend. It's my lifeline to the outside world. But perhaps all of us should be leaning more towards the Jack Nicholson school of thought. 'I don't even own a cellphone,' the king of cool once said.
