Queens Park Rangers owner Tony Fernandes is ready to put Caterham up for sale and is believed to be demanding £350million for the Formula One team.

The Malaysian businessman saw QPR win promotion back to the Barclays Premier League on Saturday after Bobby Zamora scored a 90th-minute winner in their play-off final victory against Derby on Saturday.

Fernandes has confirmed the club, which he bought in 2011, will fight the possibility of a £50million fine for breaching Football League Financial Play regulations.

Offer: Fernandes reportedly will put Caterham up for sale and is demanding £350m for the group

In March, the club posted a staggering 
£65.4m loss for the year ending May 2013. Under the rules, clubs are 
only entitled to make an £8m loss per season.

And a report in Malaysia on Sunday has claimed he is now ready to end his association with F1 backmarkers Caterham.

Fernandes entered the sport with Caterham - formerly known as Lotus Racing - in 2010, but his team have failed to score a single point.

The 50-year-old warned this year that he would stop if Caterham fail to improve and after a best result of 13th with Kamui Kobayashi in Malaysia. he seems ready to pull the plug.

'If we’re at the back I don’t think I’m going to carry on,' Fernandes said.

'Nothing is set in stone but after five years with no points there is a limit to one’s patience, money, motivation, etc, so it’s an important year.'
