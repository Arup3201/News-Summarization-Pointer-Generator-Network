As it appears that Brits hate being parted from the internet even when they are on holiday, many will probably be happy to know that a new website can help them chose a hotel where they can get a fast and reliable connection.

Hotel WiFi Test ranks hotels in cities around the world by the speed of their internet connection and also provides customers with other information including whether they will have to pay for it.

At the moment the website, which uses data from travellers, offers information about some hotels in the world’s biggest cities such as New York, San Francisco, Las Vegas, London, Singapore, Bangkok, Amsterdam and Hong Kong.

The ‘expected speed’ information provided on the website is collected from travellers who chose to run an internet speed test while staying at a given hotel.

Hotel WiFi Test then uses this information to rate hotels according to the quality of their Wi Fi.

According to the site, the top major hotel chains for fast and reliable Internet are Andaz, Le Meridien, Radisson Blu, Four Points, Scandic, Sheraton, Crownde Plaza, Marriott, Hyatt and Residence Inn.

From the website, holidaymakers can also book a hotel room through Hotels.com.

The news comes as good online connection was cited as a priority by 50 per cent of men and 47 per cent of women when booking a hotel in a recent survey by flight comparison websites Skyscanner.
