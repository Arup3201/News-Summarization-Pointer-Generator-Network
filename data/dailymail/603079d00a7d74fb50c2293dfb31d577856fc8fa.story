An anti-pornography watchdog group has assailed the Motion Picture Association of America for giving an R rating to Fifty Shades of Grey, which is based on a series of erotic novels.

Morality in America says the rating and accompanying reasoning given by the MPAA set a dangerous precedent by failing to properly acknowledge the film's sexual violence.

The group wants the rating bumped to an NC-17 and tweaked to include references it says more accurately portray the film's more lurid content.

Too permissive? Anti-pornography watchdog group Morality in Media attacked the Motion Picture Association of America for its decision last week to assign Fifty Shades of Grey an R rating instead of an NC-17

The MPAA handed down the R rating for what it described as the film's 'strong sexual content including dialogue, some unusual behavior and graphic nudity' reports Variety.

The term 'unusual behavior'--no doubt that of stars Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan--is what has Morality in America most outraged.

'What the term "unusual" does not account for is the coercion, sexual violence, female inequality, and BDSM themes from which the entire plot is based,' the group's statement, obtained by Entertainment Weekly, reads. 

'Such a vague evaluation puts viewers at risk, sending the message that humiliation is pleasurable and that torture should be sexually gratifying.'

Morality in Media says the MPAA description of the film, which designates behavior in the film as simply 'unusual' sets a dangerous precedent for viewers whose takeaway might be that sexual violence and female inequality are positive things

Along with the harsher rating of NC-17, which would ban children from entry even with an adult, the group wants to change the MPAA description of Fifty Shades of Grey to read:

‘Promotes torture as sexually gratifying, graphic nudity, encourages stalking and abuse of power, promotes female inequality, glamorizes and legitimizes violence against women.'

The group's outrage, however, is surely only fueling anticipation for the February 13 release of the film based on the E.L. James novel of the same name.

At the very least, star Jamie Dornan isn't convinced of his breakout film's unfitness for an R rating.

He told GQ:

'If people make such a hoo-hah about the violence against women aspect of it, it’s far more common for men to be the submissive. And it’s consensual! There’s weirder s*** than that.'
