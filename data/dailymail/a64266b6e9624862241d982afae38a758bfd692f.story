A child described by his mother as 'a bit of a trouble-maker' upstaged Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd today by pulling faces behind him on the campaign trail.

One week in to the election campaign, 55-year-old Mr Rudd was visiting Ryde Uniting Church in Sydney when he was photobombed by the cheeky five-year-old Joseph Kim.

As Mr Rudd outlined his multicultural policies to the audience drawn from the Korean community, the youngster began making faces behind him.

Funny: All of a sudden, he was photobombed by cheeky five-year-old Joseph Kim

'You keep learning and one day I'll learn Korean,' the Labor party leader told the child.

Then when the PM held up a picture of the sun, little Joseph shrieked excitedly and pointed to the window.

Finally, the politician was moved next to the Labor party candidate for Bennelong, Jason Yat-Sen Li, and surrounded by small children for the photocall.

By that point Joseph, who is said to be something of an extrovert, had got into his stride, and he began dancing and pulling faces behind the two men.

Hilarious: The youngster began making faces behind the prime minister

If Mr Rudd was flustered, he refused to show it, saying: 'That's ok, he is an active participant.'

Later
the small boy's mother said he had not realised he was meeting the 
Prime Minister and had thought he was merely going to church.

'He didn't know it was a special day', Esther Lee, who has recently become an Australian citizen, told the Sydney Morning Herald.

Likening her son to a ball because 'you don't know where he's going to bounce to next', she added: 'He's very bright and a bit of a troublemaker.'
