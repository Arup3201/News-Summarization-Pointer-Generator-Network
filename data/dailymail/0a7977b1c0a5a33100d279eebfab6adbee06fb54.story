A British teacher is fighting for his life in a Thai hospital after a stranger savagely attacked him with a metal bar.

Adam Pickles, 40, is in a coma after the brutal assault which left him needing emergency brain surgery.

In a tragic twist of irony, Adam, of Bradford, West Yorks., who used to teach at a school in Wakefield, had only just recovered from a horrific motorbike crash.

Attack: Adam Pickles, 40, is in a coma after the brutal assault in Thailand which left him needing emergency brain surgery

It had also left him in a coma, missing the birth of his eight-month-old son Benjamin.

His parents Adele, 61, and Andrew, 62, have flown from their home in Leeds to be at his bedside while friends at home and abroad rally to raise the cost of his medical care.

Mrs Pickles said: 'It breaks my heart. The days seem very long, just waiting, waiting, hoping he'll come back to us. It's any mum's worst nightmare.

'We are hoping he can make as full a recovery as possible for Benjamin. He absolutely loves him and he had so many plans for him. We really need him to come back to us for the sake of his little boy.'

Mr Pickles, a former teacher at the Cathedral School in Wakefield, moved to Thailand seven years ago, where he lives in Pattaya and works at the Regent's International School as head of English.

He was attacked as he drove home alone from a bar in the Nong Prue district, where he plays pool, last Thursday.

On the way, he stopped and got out of his car, although it is not known why. He was then beaten over the head before his attacker - who is believed to be a Westerner - drove off, leaving him for dead.

Thai police are investigating but have not yet arrested anyone.

A passer-by found Mr Pickles and he was rushed to hospital, where he is in intensive care after emergency surgery to remove blood clots from his brain.

Mrs Pickles said: 'They have said this week is the crucial time as to whether he makes it.'

Doctors say it could take up to a month for him to wake, and the brain damage may leave him with impaired speech and movement.

More than 4,000 people have joined a Facebook group set up to help pay for Mr Pickles' medical treatment and bring him home.

Friends, relatives, former students and strangers have sent hundreds of messages of support to his parents and Benjamin's mother Pafan.

Between them they have pledged more than £10,000 in 48 hours.

Mrs Pickles said: 'It is giving us so much comfort to know everyone loves him so much. He would just be overwhelmed by the response.

'People have been so generous and we are so grateful. We want to say thank you so much.'

The hospital charges more than £2,000 a day, and medical repatriation may cost at least £70,000.

Mr Pickles' insurance will not cover the full bill, and his care after the motorbike crash cost family and friends more than £15,000.

His best friend Neil Clappison, of Leeds, said: 'It feels completely unreal that this is happening to Adam after all he went through last year.

'It was horrendous for him to miss the birth of his beautiful son, so what is happening now seems almost unbelievable.

'We are doing everything we can to raise the money needed to ensure Adam survives and then to bring him home.

'The hospitals there are ruthless and if they don't have the money on a per day basis, they may leave you to die.

'We won't let this happen to somebody who really is one in a million.'

Danielle Nicholls, a former colleague at the Cathedral School where he worked from 2001 to 2005, said: 'He's one of those characters that everyone who meets him loves.

'He radiates positivity and makes everyone smile. We're all very saddened by his situation and will do everything we can to support the fundraising campaign.

'We send all our love and sincere hopes for his full recovery to his family.'
