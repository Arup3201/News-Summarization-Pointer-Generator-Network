In what has been described as Nokia's last hurrah, the firm has unveiled a new range of devices, including the company's first ever tablet and phablets, at an event in Abu Dhabi.

The new devices are the first to be announced since Microsoft bought the Finnish firm last month, and are hoping to compete with the tablets expected to be unveiled by Apple later today.

The high-end phablet, called Nokia's Lumia 1520, has a 6-inch screen and a 20MP PureView camera. While the Nokia 2520 has a 10.1-inch screen and runs Windows RT.

The Nokia Lumia 2520 is the Finnish firm's first ever tablet and was announced at the Nokia World event in Abu Dhabi. It has a 10.1-inch screen and runs Windows RT. The announcement comes just hours before Apple unveils what is expected to be its next-generation iPads

Apple's launch event comes just hours after Nokia entered the tablet market with its 10.1-inch Lumia 2520, pictured, and Microsoft started selling its new Surface devices

Ian Fogg, director of mobile at IHS tweeted: 'I’m unconvinced that Nokia is convinced by the Lumia 2520 tablet: only three announced launch countries: US,UK and Finland.

'The Lumia 1320 is an outstanding smartphone for the $339 pre tax/subsidy, large and heavy, but delivers a good experience for the price.

While 'the Lumia 1520 continues to be held back by Windows Phone software: high-res 20MP photos must be copied to PC to share/back-up, unlike Android.

Ryan Reith, mobility research director at IDC added: 'Nokia Lumia 1320 should be the real takeaway from today's announcements. Budget phablet to fill enormous emerging market demand.'

Geoff Blaber, CCS Insight's VP Research, Americas told MailOnline: 'The newly announced Lumia 2520 is a toe in the water for Nokia - It will learn a lot from marketing and selling this product and we should not expect huge sales volume from this first attempt.

'The Lumia 1520 is Nokia’s flagship halo device but the Lumia 1320 is the most important product launched at Nokia World. The price point is aggressive and takes the fight to Samsung.'

The Lumia 2520 costs $499 (£309) and comes in red, blue, white and black. Its screen has a pixel density of 218.

It contains a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 quad-core processor, 2GB Ram and a 800mAH battery.

The Lumia 1520 costs $749 (£464) and will be available in red, yellow, white and black, with the same Qualcomm processor and RAM as the 2520.

It has a 3400mAH battery, which Nokia claims 
has a 25-hour talk time battery life and its full HD 1080p screen has a pixel density of 368.

Nokia has added the Camera editing tools seen on the Lumia 1020, including advanced zoom and exposure tools to these new, large-screen devices.

A cheaper, 6-inch model called Lumia 1320 was also announced, with a 720p screen and 5MP camera and will cost $339 (£210). Available in orange, yellow, black and white.

Additionally, Nokia announced three new phones in its entry-level Asha range starting at $69 (£42) and feature 2MP and 5MP cameras.

Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop, pictured, unveiled the Finnish firm's first phablet-style device called the Nokia Lumia 1520. It has a 6-inch, 1080p display and a 20MP camera, will come in red, yellow, black and white starting from $749 (£464)

Nokia recently unveiled its Lumia 1520 phone, pictured left, and the Lumia 2520 tablet, pictured right. Based on the details filed in the patent, future Nokia devices could be curved, similar to LG's G Flex phone, be super-thin, or could fold in themselves

With the new Nokia Asha range, photos can be shared with one click to Facebook, Twitter, over Bluetooth and now Whatsapp.

The
 original Asha 501 handset was announced in May and began shipping in 
June. It is an entry-level device with a 3-inch screen, 3.2MP camera and
 comes in red, green, cyan, yellow, white and black.

The new Asha photo and sharing features will be available on the Asha 501 as part of a software update 'soon.'

Asha 500 has a 2MP camera and starts 
at $69 (£42), the 502 and 503 handsets both have 5MP cameras and costs 
$89 (£55) and $99 (£61) respectively.

Popular apps including Vine and Instagram have also been added to the Windows Phone store.

Apple is expected to release its next-generation iPads at an event starting at 6pm UK time.

A cheaper, 6-inch model called Lumia 1320, pictured on the screen at the Nokia World event in Abu Dhabi, was also announced, with a 720p screen and 5MP camera. It will cost $339 (£210), and be available in orange, yellow, black and white
