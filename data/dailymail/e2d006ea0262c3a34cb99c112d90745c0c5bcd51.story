If ever it looks like we might be getting a bit above our station, we can always rely on our siblings to pull us back down to earth.

And that is exactly what happened to this young showboating lion as he showed off his athletic prowess in front of his less than impressed brother.

The play fighting pair were spotted by photographer David Jenkins, at the Antelope Park in Zimbabwe.

Monkeying around: A lion looks casually at photographer David Jenkins at the Antelope Park in Zimbabwe as his brother attempts to climb a tree above him

Where do you think you're going? A lion bites the end of his brother's tail, pictured left, before jumping up on to the tree himself to try and knock his brother down

As he climbs the tree, effortlessly shinning up the trunk with his powerful claws, his brother looks out across the landscape, perhaps not as eager to show off.

But then it seems he has had enough of his playmate getting all the attention as suddenly, he springs to catch him by the tail.

Big cat fight: The lion bounds up the tree after his brother who has found refuge in the branches

On the purr-owl: The lion ends up back on the ground after losing his grip - but is determined not to give up

Going, going, gone: The lion finally shows his brother who's boss after managing to tackle him to the ground

Unable to pull him back down with his jaws alone he joins him on the tree trunk.

Then the games really begin, with the lions playfully tussling with each other as they engage in a battle of strength.

But in the end, gravity always wins, and the pair soon fall to the ground, where they continue their play fight in earnest.
