The hat worn by Napoleon Bonaparte during one of his greatest ever military victories today sold for a record breaking £1.5million.

An anonymous South Korean paid the enormous sum for the black felt bicorne which the French leader wore at the Battle of Marengo in 1800.

Napoleon was at the height of his military powers, and crushed Austrian forces, driving them out of Italy.

Record breaker: This black felt bicorne hat worn by French dictator Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Marengo in 1800 was bought by a South Korean for a staggering £1.5million in Fontainebleau, near Paris

The two-pointed hat, of a style widely worn by military officers at the time, was usually worn sideways by Napoleon, making him easy to spot on the battlefield.

He wore around 120 during his life, including one at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, when he was famously defeated by a British-led army under the Duke of Wellington.

The last time one of the hats came up for sale in France was in 1968, meaning there was huge interest in this weekend's sale at Fontainebleau, near Paris.

Auctioneers Osenet had originally put a reserve price on the headwear of just under half-a-million pounds.

Jean-Pierre Osenet, president of the house, said: 'Napoleon wore his bicorne hats in a different way to everybody else and that was sideways. He did this to make himself stand out and be easily identified.

'There are not that many historical people who can be identified by a single item. Churchill was famous for his cigars, and Napoleon was famous for his hats.

Dictator: Napoleon, who was famed for wearing his bicornes sideways, owned around 120 hats during his reign from 1804 to 1815. The auctioned hat  was recovered by Napoleon's personal vet, Joseph Giraud

'It is said that there are about 20 of his original hats in the world today and most of them are in museums and can't be sold. Maybe there are just two or three in private hands.

'The last one that sold at public auction was in 1968 and it was bought by the Champagne company Chandon.'

Napoloen changed his hat at least three times a year, and this one was recovered by Joseph Giraud, Napoleon's personal vet, after he had finished with it.

The 19in-long headpiece has a grey-green quilted silk interior and shows signs of wear. It remained in Mr Giraud's family until 1926 when it was sold to Prince Louis II of Monaco, who was related to Napoleon.

The prince collected all sorts of memorabilia relating to the French emperor which are displayed at the Napoleon Museum of Monaco.

But the Grimaldi family is now selling some of Prince Louis's collection at auction after deciding to pursue new museum projects and refurbish of their palace in Monaco.

Also sold were a pair of Napoleon's stockings, gloves, a shirt and silver drinking cups.

Napoleon named his most famous horse Marengo after the battle, and the pair also fought together at Waterloo before Marengo was captured and ended his life in Britain.

Before the bicorne, there was the tricorne - a three-cornered hat which became popular in the 18th Century.

The tricorne evolved from the broad-rimmed round hats worn by Spanish soldiers by pinning up three sections to form a triangle. 

For this reason, they were also known as 'cocked hats'.

The modification allowed gentry, in particular, to show off their expensive wigs, but their smaller size also made them much more practical to carry.

By the end of the 18th Century, however, the tricorne had fallen out of fashion in favour of the bicorne.

However, tricornes can still be seen today as part of the uniform of the Chelsea Pensioners (top right).

The bicorne was generally worn with the points at the front and back.

But Napoleon chose to wear them sideways 'to make himself noticed', according to auctioneer Jean-Pierre Osenat.
