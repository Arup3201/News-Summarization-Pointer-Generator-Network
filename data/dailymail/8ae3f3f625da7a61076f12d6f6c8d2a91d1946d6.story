He is perhaps more well-known for his famous girlfriends than his rugby skills these days. But Thom Evans has turned the spotlight firmly back on himself in a new swimwear campaign.

Showing off his honed 
physique, the 28-year-old poses in a range of fitted trunks for 
D.HEDRAL's debut BEACH Collection.

Thom's
latest shoot sees him modelling the label's Anglefit range, which has been designed to help lift the bottom and give a more defined and pert look by holding everything in place with 'zero sagging.'

As he smoulders in the sea and poses
against a wall, displaying his stellar six-pack, the label certainly seems to live up to its claims.

Shot
on the sun-drenched beaches of Barbados, Thom poses alongside
Brazilian model Paolla Rahmeier, who showcases the brand-new women's 
swimwear range.

What would Jessica say? Thom gets up close and personal with Paolla Rahmeier, who he spent three days on set with perfecting their chemistry for the romantic shoot

And while he may 
be happily dating 90210 star Jessica Lowndes, Thom and Paolla spent three 
days together on set perfecting some seemingly steamy chemistry for each shot.

A spokesman for D.HEDRAL said they believe Thom to be the next big male model sensation.

'Thom just gets better and better at modelling. He is so comfortable with his body,' they said.

'We no longer compare him to David Beckham, we think Thom smashed through that comparison six months ago.

Revealing: The new swimwear collection is designed to ensure that there is no sagging

'We personally think that Thom is the new David Gandy.

'His body is in better shape and he 
has the perfect balance of youth, masculinity, beauty and athletic frame
that is very camera friendly.

'Since
his rugby days Thom has continued to refine and sculpt this body to 
become slimmer and more toned. Right now he is in the best shape of his 
life.'

Jealous, us? Thom and Jessica, seen sharing a kiss at Coachella, have been dating since February after the Glasgow Warriors player moved to Los Angeles to concentrate on his acting career

Thom, who is signed with Select Models Management, has recently moved to Los Angeles to focus on his modelling and acting career.
