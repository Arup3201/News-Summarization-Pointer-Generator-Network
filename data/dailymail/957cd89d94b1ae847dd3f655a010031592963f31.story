Opportunistic cybersquatters are attempting to cash in on the Duchess of Cambridge's pregnancy by registering websites associated with the Royal baby.

In the past week, http://aroyalbaby.com and www.royalfoetus.com have been taken by savvy web users and littered with adverts.

These mirror twitter feeds such as @Royal Foetus which were registered within hours of the public announcement.

Following the marriage between Prince William and Kate Middleton, cybersquatters hopped on the baby bandwagon as early as January by registering sites such as www.katewilliambaby.com.

Sally Tomkotowicz, from names.co.uk, which registers domain names, said: 'It’s exciting for the whole nation that Kate is expecting – and cybersquatters are no exception.

'We’ve seen domain name cybersquatting activity for key domains increase in the past 48 hours as news has emerged on the Royal couple.

'It’s not just websites that can get taken by opportunistic squatters either. You can see it happen elsewhere on social media,' Ms Tomkotowicz added.

'On twitter, spoof accounts for Kate have been activated by a whole host of impersonators from @kate_middleton to @PrincessKateFTW.

'The Royal couple are among many well known names who have had problems with cybersquatters from Richard Branson to Mariah Carey and Leona Lewis.'

Cybersquatting can involve registering, trafficking or using a domain name with bad faith and intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else.

Cybersquatters sometimes offer to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark  at an inflated price.

The new arrival isn’t the first HRH to become the target of cybersquatting. www.willsandkate.com has previously been taken by a third party, and the baby’s grandfather Prince Charles has also lost key domains, with his UK website www.princecharles.co.uk taken by a professional Prince Charles impersonator.

Meanwhile the baby’s Great Grandfather has had his www.thedukeofedinburgh.co.uk taken by a pub.

Some
businesses are also seeing a rise in traffic because of 
their related web domain names after news broke about Kate Middleton’s 
bump.

The Royal Nursery, which has domain names including www.royalbaby.com and www.theroyalnursery.com, sells gifts and clothes for newborns in San Diego, US and has been slow to load ever since Kate and Wills confirmed that they were expecting.

Founder Mark D. John’s said: 'At the time my first son was born, Princess Diana was expecting Prince William.

'When it came to choosing the name for my business, I pictured in my mind Prince William's Royal Nursery. It was at that moment that "The Royal Nursery" was chosen as our trade name.'

'I registered some of these domain names as early as 1997 including www.TheRoyalNursery.com, www.theRoyalNursery.co.uk, www.RoyalNursery.com, www.RoyalNursery.co.uk and www.RoyalBaby.com.

'We just registered the domain names www.Royalbabytwins.com and www.Royalbabytwins.co.uk, just in case Kate has twins.

'Because of the pending birth of a royal heir, The Royal Nursery has now come full circle from its conception when the inspiration was the birth of Prince William. Needless to say, we are thrilled by the good news from the royal household.'
