A 73-year old veteran from Florida has been fired from a Cracker Barrel restaurant for giving a homeless man a muffin.

Joe Koblenzer has worked at the restaurant in Venice for the past three-and-a-half year and appears to have a heart of gold.

It was when a man who looked as though he had fallen on hard times walked into the store, he thought he would give him a little extra.

'He looked a little needy. He asked if I had any mayonnaise and some tarter sauce. He said he was going to cook a fish,' he told ABC 7.

Fired: Joe Koblenzer, a 73-year old veteran says he was fired from the Cracker Barrel restaurant in Venice for giving someone who looked in a need a few condiment packets and a corn muffin

Don't break the rules! The restaurant say Joe gave food away on several occasions and was written up for it

The man whose job it is to be friendly, obliged. 'I got it for him. As he walked out I put a corn muffin in.'

That gesture cost Joe his job. 'The General Manager called me in and said he had some bad news for me. Joe we are going to have to let you go.'

Joe says that he has been written up before for what sound like the most trivial of things.

Once he was reprimanded for getting a fountain drink on the job and on a second occasion he gave a cup of coffee to woman, which he claims he paid for.

The culprit: Joe gave a homeless a corn muffin for free. He was fired for doing so

Rewarded: Joe says he has worked hard to earn the four gold stars that adorned his apron

A lifetime of service: Joe served his country in Vietnam and he now says he is looking for something else to supplement his Social Security

He admits that rues are rules. 'It's a rule. They legally can do this because I did break the rule. I completely forgot about it. I am a host at Cracker Barrel with a little above minimum wage job.'

The debate over the seriousness of the event and the subsequent firing has a debate online.

Joe's niece, Penny Robinson Hockey says that she is appalled her her uncles' treatment.

'He is truly such a wonderful and friendly guy. He was such a joy to those he greeted at CB. They wronged him in the worst possible way!! Shame on Cracker Barrel!! I will never step foot into one again.'

Others, like Mike Cecil, have been less sympathetic.'I worked at Cracker barrel when they first opened. They were very strict about their products. 

I think it is horrible this vet lost his 
job over a muffin. But the store has rules the food is their property. 
Where does the employer draw the line. Maybe next time it would be a 
sandwich, a full meal? He violated the policy's he was well aware of.'

Rules are rules: Joe understands the reasons why he has been fired but thinks the restaurant came down a little harsh on him

Upset: There has been outrage on the restaurants Facebook page with many demanding he be given his job back

While some are saying it's the company’s right, the establishments reviews have plummeted with more than 30 negative comments about the firing.

'I feel badly. It shines a bad light on the company. I would not want that on any company, but it happened,' says Joe.

He says he's sad over the situation and misses the regulars and employees he's gotten to know; earning the maximum amount of stars on his apron for performance achievement and responsibility. 'You know what? At 73, I was really proud of doing this. I was really proud of getting those stars.'

The Vietnam vet who was trying to supplement his Social Security is now looking for work.

Hanging up his apron: Joe says he served with pride and what he did was 'morally right'

Cracker Barrel have released the following statement:

'Mr. Koblenzer has worked as a host at Cracker Barrel’s Sarrasota store since April 2011.

During the time he was employed, he violated the Company’s policies regarding consuming food without paying or giving away free food, on five separate occasions.

Mr. Koblenzer received multiple counselings and written warnings reminding him about the company’s polices and the consequences associated with violating them. On the fifth occasion, again per Company policy, Mr. Koblenzer was terminated.

Cracker Barrel is grateful for and honors Mr. Koblenzer’s service to our country as we honor all service men and women and their families.'
