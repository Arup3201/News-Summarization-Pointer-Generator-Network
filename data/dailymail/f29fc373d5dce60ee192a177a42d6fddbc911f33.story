Boris Johnson has admitted he is frequently told off for not brushing his hair.

The London Mayor’s unkempt blonde mop has helped make him one of the most-recognised politicians in the country.

But appearing on ITV’s Saturday Night Takeaway tomorrow night he is presented with a comb by Little Ant and Dec, which he says he will use – to scratch his back.

London Mayor Boris Johnson has been grilled by Little Ant and Dec for this week's Saturday Night Takeaway

Boris Johnson's hair is often out of control, but he seemed unsure about what to do with a comb

Mr Johnson’s hair looks such a mess that in the past he has been asked if he cuts it himself.

Despite being in charge of the one of the world’s great cities, he often looks like he has just got out of bed.

In the interview, Little Ant and Dec quizzed the Tory about whether his tousled tresses has landed him in hot water.

Little Dec asked the Mayor: ‘Do you get told off for never brushing your hair?’

Mr Johnson admitted: ‘Yes very frequently.  I do it’s a failing of mine.’

Little Dec then presents the Mayor with a comb, but he appears reluctant to use it for its intended purpose.

Mr Johnson said: ‘Thank you very much I will keep that it’s a handy looking object, I can use it to scratch my back.’

The duo handed over the comb during the interview filmed at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park ahead of its official opening on April 3

In the interview, to be broadcast tomorrow night, Mr Johnson was also asked about why his role as Mayor does not come with suitable regalia.

Little Ant asked: ‘If you are the Mayor where is your big hat and gold chain?’

Reluctantly, Mr Johnson confessed: ‘I don’t have either a hat or a chain.’

When Little Ant added:  ‘You’re The Mayor you should have that stuff’ Mr Johnson replied: ‘Well I know it’s very nice of you to say so Little Ant.’

The interview was filmed at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park ahead of its official opening on April 3.

The cheeky interviewing duo, who look like the ITV stars Ant and Dec, also challenged Mr Johnson about how attractive the women of London are.

Little Dec asked: ‘My daddy said there is a lot of posh totty in London what does he mean?’

Mr Johnson replied: ‘I don’t know what your father means by that but I’m sure he’s right.’
