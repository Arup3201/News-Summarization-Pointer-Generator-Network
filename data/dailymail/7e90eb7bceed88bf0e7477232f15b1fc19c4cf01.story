Few mothers agonise over whether their child is allowed to play in the garden, but for Rebecca Crutchley, even the simplest decision could have life-and-death consequences.

Her five-year-old daughter Ava suffers with the rare condition Shwachman Diamond Syndrome (SDS), which compromises her immune system so much that a common cold could kill her.

The rare condition, which affects just 60 people in the UK, affects digestion, growth, immune system, bone marrow, teeth and skeletal development.

And because a sufferer's bone marrow does not function properly, they possess little or no immune system. 

Constant risk: For Rebecca Crutchley, each day involves life-and-death decisions, as her five-year-old daughter Ava suffers from a rare condition that compromises her immune system

The disease makes Ava extremely prone to infection and puts her at an increased risk of developing bone marrow failure and septicaemia.

Around 30 per cent sufferers also develop acute myeloid leukaemia, one of the deadliest forms of cancer.

‘Ava could be playing outside one day, and fighting for her life the next,’ says Rebecca, 33, from Wigston, Leicestershire.

‘It is worrying that she could develop leukaemia at any time, but she deserves a childhood.’

The disease is so rare that her parents are unsure of what Ava’s life-expectancy will be.

SDS is an inherited genetic disorder. Both Rebecca, and Ava's father, Tom, carry one copy of the mutated gene, but were not aware of their genetic defect until Ava was diagnosed aged one.

‘It was a relief when she was diagnosed,' said Mrs Crutchley. 'Although it was hard work at first, now we've got the condition under control and know what symptoms to look for.’

Happy days: Despite her serious condition, which puts her at an increased risk of leukemia, Ava tries to enjoy a normal childhood

Each day Ava must take eight different medications and have an injection to keep the symptoms of the condition at bay.

However, the medication means that if Ava did develop leukaemia, it would spread much quicker than in a normal case.

As a result she must undergo bone marrow tests every 18 months to check for the first signs of the cancer.

‘We try to go on holiday or travel to see family every year - we've been to Hong Kong to see family and Euro Disney,’ adds Mrs Crutchley.

When Ava was younger she suffered with malnutrition, recurrent infection, fatigue and thin hair

‘I take precautions in having specialised travel insurance and always make sure our doctor is available if we need to call.’

When Ava was a baby her suffered with malnutrition, fatigue, hair loss, extremely dry, fragile skin as well as frequent infections which required hospitalisation.

‘Doctors kept trying to tell me she was just a slow developer, but I knew it was more than that.

‘She was scarily ill - all she would do was scream and sleep. I work as a medical secretary so I was I was working or with Ava, I was constantly  in hospital. I didn't see daylight for days.’

Ava is youngest person with SDS to possess a working pancreas.

Doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital 
(GOSH) started the then three-year-old Ava on a pancreatic supplement 
called Creon, but after six months of taking the medicine, Ava's 
pancreas started working on its own.

Ava's nine-year-old sister Freya is a bone marrow match for her, should she need it

Usually children with the condition don't possess a functioning pancreas until the age of seven, if at all.

And because this was so extraordinary, Great Ormond Street contacted the family to ask whether Ava could participate in research to use at the SDS conference in America.

‘Doctors want to trial her off the jab because they don't know the long-term effects [of the medication], but she develops symptoms almost straight away if she misses one,’ explains Mrs Crutchley. ‘It's very worrying but Ava is very brave.'

The family know that their nine-year-old daughter Freya is a bone marrow match for Ava, but if Ava underwent the transplant now there would be a higher chance of rejection.

‘She could go into bone marrow failure tomorrow, but we can't keep her wrapped in cotton wool,’ says Rebecca. ‘She needs to get out and be a normal child.'

Ava's cousin Isaac Crutchley is running the Greater Manchester Marathon in April for GOSH. To sponsor Isaac go to www.justgiving.com/Isaac-Crutchley.
