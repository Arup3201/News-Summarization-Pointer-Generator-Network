Hats off to Ronald Koeman for the genius job he has done in rebuilding Southampton's depleted side.

Pundits and fans feared for the club's Premier League future when they lost Rickie Lambert, Luke Shaw, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren - among others - in the summer.

But their third place in the table, including that 8-0 thrashing of Sunderland at the weekend, has taken everyone by surprise.

Southampton have made an excellent start to the domestic season, despite a summer of turmoil

One of the shining lights left behind, James Ward-Prowse, even admitted on Saturday that the club were in 'turmoil' with so many high-profile departures.

But Koeman came in, sorted through the rubble and patiently sought-out their replacements.

Even then, two relative unknowns from Holland's Eredivisie – Graziano Pelle and Dusan Tadic – were not the star names supporters were hoping for and the loans of Ryan Bertrand and Toby Alderweireld did not, on first impression, appear adequate defensive acquisitions. 

However, on early-season form, Koeman has made by far the shrewdest signings of the window.

Sportsmail takes a look at how the new recruits have stepped into the boots of their predecessors.

Saints boss Ronald Koeman has done a terrific job at the club since taking over in the summer

Dusan Tadic (£10.9m from FC Twente) v Adam Lallana (sold to Liverpool £25m)

Lallana was perhaps the hardest to replace after he moved.

While  Lambert was scoring the goals, Lallana was providing the heartbeat of the side.

So often he was involved in everything going forward and as well as being able to unlock defences with a pass from anywhere in the final third, he weighed in with his share of goals too.

But Tadic has displayed wizardry to match the attacking midfielder; seven assists in eight games, 20 chances created, 278 passes, 88 crosses and one goal.

'He is always moving and moving to spaces to play and give the assists which creative players can and that is difficult,' was Koeman's assessment.

'Players like Tadic have to score between seven, eight and nine goals every season and he knows now he has to work hard for that.'

If there was any fear Southampton would flatline without Lallana, Tadic has been the defibrillator sparking them back to life.

Ryan Bertrand (loan from Chelsea) v Luke Shaw (sold to Manchester United £31m)

The loss of Shaw was another huge blow to the club.

Shaw is one of the most exciting left backs in the country – nurtured into an England player at Southampton – and he had taken to the top-flight with ease. He often played more like a left winger than a left-back, but was rarely caught out defensively.

There really is no replacement for a player of that ability, still only 19, but Koeman wanted a full back with a similar attacking threat and in  Bertrand he has found that.

'I can't compare him with Shaw because I don't know a lot about Shaw but we are happy to have that kind of player in our squad,' Koeman said.

'He brings quality, he brings personality, and he knows about the level and pressure of Chelsea and that's important for the rest of the team.'

While Shaw has struggled for fitness and with injury at United this campaign, Bertrand has been flying on that flank for Southampton.

Graziano Pelle (£8million from Feyenoord) v Rickie Lambert (sold to Liverpool £4m)

Lambert will always be a hero on the south coast.

His goals played a huge part in firing them from the third tier to the top flight in just two seasons; scoring 21 the year they went up from League One and 31 in the Championship.

His strikes in the Premier League also earned him an England call-up, but there is no denying he was struggling for form in the latter stages of last season.

This campaign he is yet to score for Liverpool, has missed good chances and has been limited to 125 minutes in the league.

In comparison, Pelle is keeping pace with the league's top-scorers with six in eight games and is lighting up St Mary's with goals such as the overhead kick he scored against QPR.

Even when he scored twice and ran Sunderland's back line ragged at the weekend, Pelle insisted he 'didn’t play so well.'

Koeman witnessed first-hand his prolific goal-scoring while in charge at Feyenoord, where he netted 50 goals in 57 league games in the past two seasons.

He has had no trouble in transferring that to English football.

Toby Alderweireld (loaned from Atletico Madrid) v Dejan Lovren (sold to Liverpool £20m)

Lovren was developing a reputation as one of the best centre backs in the league last season.

He angered Southampton fans by publicly forcing through a move to Liverpool but the centre of their defence looked weak without him.

Jose Fonte has established himself as a solid centre half but Maya Yoshida's name on a team-sheet must have had centre forwards rubbing their hands together in anticipation of the game ahead.

Alderweireld, fresh from being part of Atletico Madrid's side which won La Liga and were runners up in the Champions League, has been exactly what they needed.

He is strong positionally, is good on the ball and at playing his way out from the back.

'He's an experienced player,' Koeman explained. 'He's played a the high level of the Champions League. We need that, it's a long season, it's another competitive player for the rest of the squad.'
