Home to more than half of the world's wild tigers, India today reported that the tiger population has jumped by 30 per cent over the last four years. 

A census counted 2,226 tigers in India last year compared with 1,706 in 2010, officials in New Delhi announced.

Environment minister Prakash Javadekar hailed the rise as a 'huge success' as India battles to save the endangered animals from poachers and smugglers as well as the destruction of their natural habitat.

Today's census found 2,226 tigers in India last year compared with 1,706 in 2010 - an increase of 30 per cent

Environment minister Prakash Javadekar cited improved management of India's more than 40 tiger reserves for the increase. Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan (pictured above) is famous for its tigers

He said: 'While the tiger population is falling in the world, it is rising in India. We have increased by 30 per cent from the last count. That is a huge success story.'

The minister cited improved management of India's more than 40 tiger reserves for the increase.

Tigers have been threatened by rampant poaching and shrinking habitats from deforestation caused by power projects, roads and human settlements as the country pushes ahead with rapid industrialization and economic development.

The disappearance of forests has affected the availability of prey and led tigers to stray into human habitats.

Javadekar said the government was working to reduce deadly encounters between tigers and villagers, as farmers encroached on forest land and the big cats left reserves to search for water and food.

An estimated 9,700 hidden cameras were used in known tiger habitats including in the northeast state of Assam and western Rajasthan to take photographs of the animals for the census. 

Officials said they surveyed nearly 380,000 sq km of forest area in 18 states.  

Parks including Pench, Kanha, Bandavgarh, Panna, Corbett National Park and Ranthambhore National Park are open during the months of October to April - the autumn and winter seasons in India.

During these months, viewing tigers and other wildlife is possible but the landscape changes rapidly during this period.

'Never before has such an exercise been taken. 

'We have unique photographs of 80 per cent of the tigers in the wild', Javadekar said.

India's conservation programme has been working to halt their decline.

The numbers have been rising since hitting a low of 1,411 in 2006 but the current population still remains a long way off 2002 when around 3,700 tigers were estimated to be alive in the country.

There were thought to be around 40,000 tigers in India at the time of independence from Britain in 1947. 

Authorities across Asia are waging a major battle against poachers who often sell tiger body parts to the lucrative traditional Chinese medicine market.
