Serial killer Rodney Alcala, known as the ‘Dating Game Killer' due to his appearance on the famous television game show more than 30 years ago, was sentenced to at least 25 years in prison on Monday for murdering two New York women in the 1970s.

Alcala, 69, already on death row in California for raping and mutilating four women and a 12-year-old girl in the Los Angeles area, was extradited to New York in June to face charges in the murders of flight attendant Cornelia Crilley, 23, and Ellen Hover, 23, the daughter of a nightclub owner.

Crilley was found strangled in her Manhattan apartment in 1971. Hover's body was found in the woods of Westchester County, north of New York City, in 1977.

The Manhattan district attorney's office brought charges against Alcala last year after conducting new interviews with more than 100 witnesses.

‘I want to thank the family and friends of the two victims for their eloquent statements,’ Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Bonnie Wittner told the courtroom, which was packed with friends and family of Crilley and Hover.

‘This kind of case is the kind I've never experienced and hope to never again,’ Wittner said before turning away from her microphone and breaking into tears for a few seconds. ‘Sorry,’ the judge said as she gathered herself to continue. ‘I just want to say I hope the family finds some peace and solace.’

Wittner sentenced Alcala to 25 years to life in prison.

The serial killer had already been sentenced to lethal injection in California for his 2010 conviction on the five Los Angeles area murders which he committed between 1977 and 1979.

Alcala will now be returned to San Quentin, where he is actively appealing his death sentence.

For the families and friends of the two murdered Manhattan women, the chance to confront Alcala and watch him being led in and out of court in handcuffs, offered a degree of closure, they said.

‘Mr. Alcala I want you to know that you broke my parents’ hearts and they never really recovered,’ Crilley's sister, Katie Stigall, 63, of Rockland County, said in an emotive victim impact statement.

Working as a professional photographer, Alcala, who is said to have an IQ above 160, lured his victims by offering to take their pictures, authorities say.

While he has been incarcerated in New York, he has not had library privileges so he has not been able to conduct research and work on his case and he intimated in court on Friday that he is eager to resume work on trying to get himself off death row.

Decades of suspicion, an indictment last year and 18 months of legal maneuvering over extraditing him culminated last month when he arrived in New York City on a U.S. Marshals Service plane. The convicted serial killer was placed in police custody.

Alcala was indicted in January 2011, after the Manhattan district attorney's cold-case unit re-examined the cases, looked at countless documents that emerged during the California trial and conducted their interviews with the dozens of witnesses.

'It is my hope that this indictment brings a small measure of peace to the families and friends who have spent decades searching for answers, and justice,' Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance told the New York Post this summer.

California authorities had said they were exploring whether Alcala could be tied to cases in New York and other states. They had released more than 100 photos, found in his storage locker, of young women and girls.

'These cases were built one brick at a time, as each new lead brought us closer to where we are today,' District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. said when Alcala was indicted, adding that he hoped the indictment 'brings a small measure of peace to the families and friends who have spent decades searching for answers, and justice.'

Hover, a Manhattan socialite with a degree in biology, was seeking a job as a researcher, a private investigator for her family said at the time.

A talented pianist, she was 'enamored of the counterculture of the late 1960s,' her cousin Sheila Weller wrote in a 2010 Marie Claire magazine piece about Hover's death.

Weller said last month she was gratified by Alcala's indictment in her cousin's death.

Hover's disappearance and Crilley's death made headlines and spurred extensive searches in the early 1970s.TWA offered a $5,000 reward for information about Crilley's killing. Hover's relatives papered walls and kiosks with posters.

A note in Hover's calendar for the day she vanished showed she planned to have lunch with a photographer she had recently met, according to the family's private detective and news reports at the time. Her lunch date's name, authorities later said, was an alias that Alcala used.

Alcala had been a suspect in Crilley's death for several years. New York Police Department detectives investigating her killing went to California in 2003 with a warrant to interview Alcala and get a dental impression from him.

A forensic dentist later found that a bite mark on Crilley's body was consistent with Alcala's impression, a law enforcement official said in December. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Alcala has been behind bars since his 1979 arrest in one of the California killings -- the murder of Robin Samsoe, 12, of Huntington Beach. Before that arrest, he also served a prison sentence on convictions of giving marijuana to a minor and kidnapping and trying to kill an 8-year-old girl.

Alcala had attended college and worked briefly as a typist at The Los Angeles Times, according to a 1979 story in the newspaper.

He made his way onto a 1978 episode of 'The Dating Game,' the matchmaking show that was a hit in its era. Introduced as a photographer with an affinity for motorcycling and skydiving, the long-haired, leisure-suited Alcala won the contest. But the woman who chose him over two other contestants ultimately chose not to go on a date with him, saying he was 'too creepy.'

Alcala’s conviction last year came after a series of trials, overturned convictions and strange courtroom moments.

Acting as his own lawyer, the convicted serial killer offered a rambling defense that included questioning the mother of one of his victims, showing a clip of his appearance on 'The Dating Game' and playing Arlo Guthrie's 1967 song 'Alice's Restaurant.'

Alcala fought his extradition to New York, saying he needed to stay in California to attend court hearings and do other preparatory work on his appeal.
