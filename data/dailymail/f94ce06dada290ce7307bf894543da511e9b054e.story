A six-year-old girl who almost drowned alongside her brother and father is doing well in hospital as doctors say she is 'out of immediate danger'.

Florence Mynott suffered a heart attack when the boat she was in went over a 10ft weir along with her father, Julian, brothers Freddie, three and Archie, seven.

Mr Mynott, an antiques dealer, was taking a 'little pleasure trip' on the river Avon near his home when tragedy struck, killing him and Freddie.

His last moments were spent desperately trying to save the children when they were swept over the weir during  an afternoon paddle in their new rowing boat.

Tragic: Julian Mynott and his son Freddie who were drowned after their boat capsized at a weir in the river Avon in Barford, Warwickshire

Florence and Archie were rescued from the fast-flowing water by a heroic villager soon after the boat capsized on Saturday afternoon.

Mr Mynott, who specialised in high-end antiques and home furnishings, was seen attempting to swim towards his children near the upturned glass-fibre vessel but the current, increased by the recent heavy rain, was too strong.

Yesterday his father, Roger, 69, spoke of the son he described as a ‘safety freak’ who lived for his children.

From Pattaya, Thailand, where he runs 
his own antiques and interior design business, Mr Mynott senior said his
son and wife Emma, 41, had spent a ‘fortune’ renovating their new 
£660,000 riverside home.

The couple chose the house in Barford, Warwickshire, specifically because of its waterside location in a quiet village.

After
buying the property in January last year, they lived in a cottage in 
the grounds until renovation work on the building was completed around 
February this year.

Search: Rescue teams look for the missing father and son on Saturday

Tragic scene: The 4ft-high weir on the River Avon where the family's rowing boat capsized

Support: Residents left floral tributes and cards to pay respect on the River Avon earlier today

Thoughts: Cards pay respect to Freddie and Julian Mynott from friends and residents who knew them

So delighted was Mr Mynott with the completed project he told his father he was ‘never going to move from the house’.

Mr Mynott senior added: ‘He was so pleased with the house but now he will never get the chance to enjoy it.

‘I was due to come over to see it next week but now I will have mixed emotions. It’s a place where Julian spent so much time, love and money to make perfect, but he never got the chance to enjoy it.’

The tragic father, whose family pictures 
were supplied to the Mail with the blessing of a close relative, bought 
the boat as a treat for his children days before Saturday’s tragedy.

No sign: The Mynott's had only recently moved into their home in the affluent area of Barford, Warwickshire

Mr Mynott senior, who is flying home 
to England today, said his son ‘must not have known about the danger’ 
posed by the 4ft weir yards from the end of his garden.

‘I spoke to him on Saturday afternoon 
and he told me he was going out on the boat with his kids. He was so 
happy and so excited that he was taking his kids boating – it was his 
dream to go boating on the river.

‘I’m still struggling to come to terms
with it. He was the best father you could have – he just idolised his 
children. He never let those children more than five yards from his 
sight.’

Mr Mynott senior used to run an 
antiques business in Warwick. He handed the reins over to his son when 
he decided to emigrate to Thailand following the death of his wife 
Claire in 2001.

Back on the river: Despite the tragedy people still took to the river in Warwick today near to where the accident happened 

Just moments
before the  incident, the quartet were seen wearing lifejackets and 
paddling upstream – away from their home and the ‘fierce’  weir beyond.

It is thought they were swept away as Mr Mynott tried to steer the boat back to the riverbank at the foot of their garden.

Tributes: A couple pay their respects after laying flowers at the scene of the weir deaths

His father added: ‘It was a little pleasure trip, a few laps down the river and back and it all resulted in a terrible accident.

‘Julian was over-protective of his kids and for something like this to happen must have been agonising for him.

‘He spent whatever life he had left in himself trying to rescue those children.’

Mr Mynott senior described his son as a ‘one-off’ and a ‘wonderful husband and family man’.

A
huge rescue mission, involving police divers, fire brigade boat crews 
and paramedics, swung into operation after the alarm was raised at 
around 5.30pm on Saturday.

Florence
and Archie were rescued soon afterwards but it was not until 8.30pm 
that Freddie was pulled from the water.

His father’s body was found 90 
minutes later and both were confirmed dead at the scene.

Mr
and Mrs Mynott are said to have enjoyed a particularly close and loving
relationship. Mr Mynott senior said he had never known the couple to 
argue.

Mrs Mynott, a 
director in her husband’s antique business, was understood to be with 
her children at an undisclosed hospital yesterday.

The children were 
transferred there following treatment at Birmingham Children’s Hospital 
over the weekend.
