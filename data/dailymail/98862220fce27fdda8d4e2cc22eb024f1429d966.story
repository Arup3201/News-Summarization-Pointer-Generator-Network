Paul Smith's bid to become the WBO super middleweight champion ended in misery after he was outpointed by Arthur Abraham and then disrespected by the judges all in one night.

It was always going to be a big ask for Smith, in his first world title fight, getting a decision in Germany against a champion like Abraham, fighting for the world crown for the 19th time.

But he started like a train and then ended like one, giving him, his team, the 1,000 Brits in the Sparkassen Arena and the many supporting back in England hope that he may have scraped a draw, maybe even nicked a sensational win with a stirring late surge. 

Arthur Abraham beat Paul Smith on points to retain his WBO Super-Middleweight title

Smith was unable to get the better of Abraham and was behind on all of the judges scorecards

Wayne Rooney: Why have judges if they don't judge correctly. Robbing people of their dreams. The boxing board has to act.

Gary Lockett: Absolute nonsense, there has to be something done about these type of decisions. Paul Smith should be WBO champion tonight. Plain cheating.

Tony Bellew: Once again the officiating is being spoken about! Disgraceful scoring! Hold your head high mate. Poor poor judging!

Frankie Gavin: I had Paul by a round. Wouldn't of moaned at a draw but no way he lost.

Haroon Khan: Feel for Paul Smith, thought he won that. Chin up champ you boxed well and done everyone proud mate. Deserved to be champion of the world.

However, all three judges gave it to Abraham, two by six rounds and a score of 117-111 and the third a frankly ridiculous 119-109 by Spanish judge Fernando Laguna. It was a bitter end to such an absorbing spectacle as Smith, who had said in the build-up that the 'stars aligned' for him this time, set about the fading yet dangerous champion.

Abraham punched hard but not all that often, although he seemed to hurt Smith at times and arguably did enough to win the fight and retain his WBO belt. But the way in which the judges scored the bout, so thrilling and competitive at times, is another serious blow to the credibility of the sport.

Smith, incredulous, said: 'What can you do? It's disgusting. It's the main thing I hate about boxing. Most of them have never fought and they're robbing kids of life changing opportunities.

Smith put in a good performance in Germany, but it was not reflected in the judges scorecards

Smith lost on all three scorecards, 117-111, 117-111 and 119-109

'I proved I'm not British level. I did some things wrong but I did a lot of it right. I was outworking him every round for me. I was shading a lot of the rounds. It's Germany, I well and truly got my fingers burnt.'

Matthew Macklin and Martin Murray have both been on the end of wrong decisions in Germany and Smith¹s trainer here, Joe Gallagher, was in the corner for the Macklin fight, which took place in Cologne a little over three years ago. He knows what happens here.

But he had watched hours and hours of footage of the champion in action, both his more devastating middleweight days but also some of his less impressive victories at the 168lb super-middleweight limit. In watching Abraham at his best and worst, Gallagher had formulated a game plan which he and Smith were confident would be enough to dethrone 'King Arthur'.

Abraham and Smith's fight was a lot closer than the judges scorecards suggested 

And it worked early on with Smith setting a frenetic pace against Abraham, who, as is his trademark, threw punches only occasionally. There was an argument that the challenger won the first two rounds but then the champion found his stride.

The message from Gallagher throughout the week had been to 'stay with'

Abraham, once considered one of the planet's most ferocious punchers. It meant that the Liverpudlian was absorbing an awful lot of punishment and also losing the middle rounds.

But much of the build-up had been dominated by the accusation that Abraham had not taken this fight seriously and he struggled to boil down to the 168lb super-middleweight limit. As revealed by Sportsmail this week, the Berlin-Based Armenian had been regularly spotted running in a sweat suit along the Baltic coast here in Kiel - an old-school method of draining out the final few pounds.

And, whether it was a question of conditioning or just his usual style, Abraham certainly faded towards the end, giving Smith and his team renewed hope. However, all of that was crushed when the scores were announced and Smith's fate sealed.

Abraham held onto his WBO Super-Middleweight with a points win over Smith in Germany

But the 31-year-old, once considered the forgotten man of the British super-middleweight scene after knock-out defeats to younger pair George Groves and James DeGale, proved here in Kiel that he belongs at world level.

Earlier, Matthew Macklin got his career back on track by outpointing Spaniard Jose Yebes over eight rounds in his first fight under the banner of Matchroom.

Macklin signed with Eddie Hearn back in July and was supposed to headline a big homecoming show in Dublin on August 31.

However when his trainer, Jamie Moore, was shot in Marbella less than a month before the fight, the whole card was cancelled. But he finally made his bow here in the opening bout of the evening, and his first fight for 10 months.

There were some definite signs of rust against the tough 35-year-old.

Macklin¹s was the more eye-catching work but there was no denying that he got tagged more than he would have wanted but did enough to claim the victory.

The third Brit in action in Kiel was Swindon cruiserweight Luke Watkins, managed by George Groves and trained by Paddy Fitzpatrick, who was boxing for the second time in a week after making his debut at Wembley last Saturday. He moved to 2-0 with a points victory over four threes, against a late stand-in Martin Horak.
