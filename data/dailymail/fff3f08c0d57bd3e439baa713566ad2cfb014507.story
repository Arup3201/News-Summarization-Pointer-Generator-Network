A collection of fascinating private and public photos of the Kennedys have been revealed in a book and exhibition exploring the legacy of one of the most famous couples of all time.

The images - half of which have never been seen before - were captured by Life magazine's Mark Shaw, who was both the unofficial photographer for John F. Kennedy and wife Jackie, as well as a close friend and confidant.

Shaw's beautiful shots encapsulate the vibrant life of the pair, who are seen in a variety of situations, dazzling on the campaign trail or sharing a warm family moment with their daughter on holiday.

Love story: John F. Kennedy campaigning to become president, with stylish and cultured wife Jackie by his side

Special access: More than half of Shaw's photos have never been seen before and his work was treasured by the Kennedy family

Rich and famous: The fashionable couple pose in formal outfits for this charming official portrait

Shaw met the charismatic Massachusetts senator and his elegant wife in 1959, six years after their marriage, when he photographed them for Life magazine.

He developed a close friendship with the glamorous, all-American couple, allowing him extraordinary and informal access to the family.

Over the following four years, Shaw captured the couple and their children Caroline and John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr at their most relaxed.

They are pictured in Nantucket, Hyannis Port, Mass., Mrs Kennedy's family home in Merrywood, Virginia and on the Amalfi Coast of Italy.

He also photographed the couple as 
they shone in public, with stylish Jackie supporting her husband on the 
campaign trail and at his star-studded inauguration gala.

On November 8, 1960, JFK beat 
Republican
Richard M. Nixon in a very close race to become the 35th president of 
the United States, with his graceful wife standing by his side

She made the White House 
into a home, creating a kindergarten and working to restore and preserve the historical 
building while Shaw photographed the family's unique daily life

By now a fashion icon, she hosted glittering events and travelled the world gaining admiration for her elegance and goodwill.

New images: Mrs Kennedy with daughter Caroline at Hyannis Port in 1959 and later that year in Georgetown

Effortless grace: The attractive and powerful couple look at ease as they take a moment away from the strain of their heavy responsibilities

Long-lasting relationship: Shaw met the charismatic young Massachusetts senator and his elegant wife in 1959 when he photographed them for Life magazine

There was a grittier side to their outwardly perfect lifestyle, however.

JFK
reportedly had numerous affairs with pretty young girls at the White 
House, and his wife responded by having several affairs of her own.

In 1963, the couple's third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy was born, but he developed a lung problem and died two days later.

While still
recovering from this loss, another tragedy shocked the world. On 
November 22, 1963, the President and his wife were in Dallas, Texas. As 
their car drove slowly past cheering crowds, shots rang out.

President Kennedy was killed and Mrs Kennedy became a widow at the age of 34.

Height of sophistication: The couple relish a beautiful day in the garden, while Shaw captures them in their most unguarded moments

JFK's
state funeral was broadcast around the world and millions of people 
shared in his wife's grief and mourned over the premature end to the 
intriguing tale of this unique and powerful couple.

In a 
grateful note, Mrs Kennedy later thanked Shaw for his natural, exuberant
photographs, comparing him to a modern-day Caravaggio and vowing to 
treasure them always.

Shaw was renowned for both his pictures of the Kennedys and for his fashion work in the 1950s and 1960s.

He was the 
first photographer to shoot backstage and in colour at the couture shows
and produced groundbreaking work during the Vanity Fair lingerie 
campaign.
