It was the single most deadly day on the world's highest peak - 16 Sherpa guides were killed on Mount Everest when an avalanche struck the Khumbu Icefall on April 18.

On that morning, just before 7am, mountaineer Joby Ogwyn was lying his tent 17,598 ft up the iconic peak at Base Camp when the unnerving, but a familiar sound of 'creaking and groaning' caused him to stick his head out and what he saw will haunt him forever.

'Within a couple of seconds it looked like this big white dragon, thunderously loud, moving at probably 200 miles an hour, straight toward our Sherpa, who were carrying some of our equipment up to a higher camp.'

Power: The aftermath of the avalanche that came down Mount Everest on April 18 that claimed the lives of 16 Sherpas

Deadly: The avalanche struck at the Khumbu Icefall, a treacherous passage between Base Camp and Camp 1 riddled with crevasses and columns of ice known as seracs

Ogwyn, 39, who was preparing to climb Everest and then become the first man to leap off the 29,029-foot summit in a wing suit for the Discovery Channel, watched as blocks of ice the size of cars and houses crashed down the slopes.

Out of the 16 Sherpa's who died that day, three were working for Ogwyn and instead of a triumphant piece of television, the Discovery Channel crew found themselves witness to a dramatic rescue and recovery mission in the moments that followed.

Aired on Sunday night, the revised special, Everest Avalanche Tragedy, showed harrowing footage from the scene, including the heart-breaking moment rescuers discovered the leg of Sherpa, Dorjee Khatri, poking out the huge icy fall.

'I looked outside and saw the avalanche coming down,' Ogwyn recalled according to the LA Times. 'Everyone got wiped out that I could see.'

Despite not being in the deadly path, Ogwyn knew then and there that his wing suit adventure would not happen.

'We were just doing all we could do to find our guys and get their dead bodies off the mountain,' he said.

'We were trying to reach our guys by radio, but we couldn't get anyone on the radio,' an emotional Ogwyn recalled to the LA Times. 'Within an hour we knew they were dead. They'd found some pieces of equipment that had literally gotten blown off the guys. Boots and backpacks.'

At Base Camp, Ogwyn and the Discovery Channel production crew were around a half-mile from the avalanche and they instantly tried to contact his Sherpa guide team.

When they received no response, they immediately feared the worst.

Recovery: Joby Ogwyn said that it dawned on everyone very quickly that this would not be a rescue mission  

The powerful and emotional Discovery special revealed the moment that one survivor was found buried waist deep, battered and bloody from ice as heavy as blocks of concrete.

Others were simply entombed in the ice.

'It was a hanging glacier, a big piece of ice that came off the west shoulder of Everest,' Ogwyn said to zap2it.com. 'It had been there for millions of years.'

Ogwyn rushed towards the disaster zone and because of his peak physical fitness was able to make the climb in only one hour - for others it would have taken much longer.

'I knew this was going to be bad,' he said, admitting he knew this was a recovery mission, not a rescue.

In tears during the Discovery special, Ogwyn explained how he saw a helicopter airlift the tragic dead away from the scene wrapped in sleeping bags or tents.

'I sat there and watched the whole thing,' he said to Zap2It.com. 'They found body after body.'

There were three Sherpas working for Ogwyn Discovery and Peacock Productions - Dorjee Khatri, Dorjee Sherpa and Phur Temba Sherpa —  but the mountaineer knew all 16.

Respecting their reputation as the world's greatest climbers, Ogwyn specially requested those three to help carry the heavy filming equipment.

'I knew they would appreciate what I was trying to do,' he said.

During his two decades climbing the world's tallest peaks, Ogwyn had witnessed many avalanches, but nothing like this.

On Everest, everything is bigger and when a glacier breaks, 'it buries people like concrete buries the,.'

'It was a hanging glacier, a big piece of ice that came off the west shoulder of Everest,' said Ogwyn.

'It had been there for millions of years.'

Confirmation: The documentary from Discovery showed how the disaster unfolded in real time and how the production team who were there for a wing suit record attempt quickly found themselves organizing a recovery mission

During the course of the Discovery special, the build up to the moment of the avalanche was replayed, including interviews with Ogwyn, expedition leader Garrett Madison and additional members of the expedition and production teams.

'It's heartbreaking,' said a still-shaken Ogwyn. 'I've been climbing in the Himalayas for the past 15 years and forged a friendship with a lot of these guys. I'm shell-shocked by this. Everyone is.'

The network also announced they are to donate to the American Himalayan Foundation Sherpa Family Fund, which helps the families of the deceased.

Ogwyn is still reeling from the accident and told Reuters that the, 'Hardest job in the world to go rescue your dead buddies off that mountain and that’s exactly what everybody came together to do that that day.

'So it’s a really powerful story and it needs to be told. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to watch it. My heart’s broken and I’ll never, ever get over it.'

However, while his attempt to jump off Everest in his specially designed wing suit has been postponed, he is now focusing on helping the families of the dead Sherpas.

'I think what people don't realize is how much the Sherpas enjoy their jobs,' he said. 'They are far from slaves.'

'My goal went from climbing and jumping off the mountain to raising money for the families,' Ogwyn said.

He wants those willing to donate money to visit The Sherpa Family Fund, where 100 percent of the proceeds will go to the victims families.

'We were at Mt. Everest to make history, but instead we were there as eyewitnesses to history,' said Eileen O'Neill, Group President, Discovery, Science and Velocity Networks.

Indeed, in the aftermath of the disaster, the Sherpas have refused to climb, citing poor conditions and a lack of respect from the Nepal Government, who make millions each year from climbing permits.

Conversely, when a Sherpa dies their family receives $400.

'I think it's their right to,' said Ogwyn of the Sherpas' strike.

'It's very fresh in their minds... But life goes on. It's going to be pretty hard for a lot of guys to make a living if they don't want to work, including myself.

'I don't want to find something else to do and I think a lot of Sherpas in that region take a lot of pride in what they do.

'Everybody, Western people and Sherpa, needed to take some time to let this sink in and go away a little bit before we start planning the next season on Everest.'

On Wednesday, family members, mountaineers and government officials gathered in Nepal's capital Wednesday for a memorial service for the 16 Nepalese Sherpa guides killed in avalanche on Mount Everest.

They offered flower garlands and lit candles and incense in front of the photographs of the 16 Sherpa guides who died in the April 18 avalanche. The 13th day after death is the customary end of mourning and the day when Nepalis generally hold memorials.

'We are still disappointed at the government, which has done little for the family members. The help they have given is a joke, like giving money to a beggar. The state should take care of the families of the dead,' said Pasang Doma, who lost her brother in the avalanche.

While 13 bodies have been recovered, the three others are buried under heavy snow and ice.

Most of the expedition teams have left the mountain while the rest are packing their bags and gear in the base camp.

The avalanche was the deadliest disaster on the world's highest mountain. It was triggered when a massive piece of glacier sheared away from the mountain along a treacherous section of constantly shifting ice and crevasses known as the Khumbu Icefall, marked by overhanging ice as big as office buildings.
