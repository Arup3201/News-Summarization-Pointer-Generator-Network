Authorities have tracked the cell phone of a man accused of stabbing his new wife to death in Illinois last weekend to the Texas-Mexico border, according to an FBI warrant.

Arnoldo Jimenez, 30, has been charged with first-degree murder in the killing of 26-year-old Estrella Carrera, who was found dead in her bathtub in Burbank last Sunday, just 48 hours after they got married, still wearing her silver sequined party dress.

The warrant states that Jimenez used his cell phone on May 12, a day after his wedding, in the Chicago area. He continued using it through southern Illinois, near Memphis, Tennessee, through Arkansas and then into Texas.

The phone was tracked to Houston on Sunday, with the last location tracked to Hidalgo, Texas, at 10:45 pm on Sunday, according to the FBI warrant cited by the Chicago Tribune.

Hidalgo is located nearly 1,500 miles from the Burbank residence where his wife was found stabbed to death. 

The warrant also confirms information that Carrera’s family revealed about an emotional call Jimenez made to his sister, allegedly telling her that he had left his wife bleeding after a ‘bad fight.’

Another ‘close associate of Jimenez’ told authorities that Jimenez told him ‘he was leaving the state of Illinois, and if questioned by law enforcement, the associate should tell law enforcement he went to Mexico.’

Jimenez is a Texas native who owns property there in the city of Pharr, according to the warrant. His parents currently live in Mexico, and he also has relatives residing in North Carolina.

More than 30 law enforcement agencies had joined federal agents in the search for Jimenez, following up on some 300 tips they have received so far in regards to the case.

Authorities began looking for Jimenez soon after Carrera's family reported that she failed to pick up her two children, ages two and ten, Saturday as she had arranged. The family had been unable to reach Carrera or Jimenez, so they asked police to check on her at her apartment in the suburb of Burbank.

That is when the 26-year-old’s body was found in the bathtub, still clothed in the party dress she also may have worn at her wedding ceremony at Chicago's City Hall. There were no signs of forced entry into Carrera’s apartment, according to investigators.

That day, the bride's family received a haunting phone call from a sister of her new husband, who told them he had called her weeping and said that he had left his bride bleeding after a ‘bad fight.’

Most of Carrera's family disapproved of her three–year relationship with Jimenez, even though he was the father of her two-year-old son.

Jimenez had hit and bruised Carrera in the past, according to Carrera’s older sister, Jazmin. Police also said family members reported incidents of violence while the couple was dating. 

Jazmin Carrera described Jimenez as ‘very possessive’ and jealous. She said she does not understand why her sister married the 30-year-old in what seemed like a rushed ceremony that the bride had kept secret from almost everyone.

Jazmin Carrera received a text message from her sister Friday, inviting her to join them and their friends at a Mexican restaurant and a nightclub to celebrate the nuptials.

She chose not to attend.

‘It was just all of a sudden,’ Jazmin Carrera said. ‘She didn't give us enough notice.’

The pair were last seen around 4am on Saturday morning, according to officials.

On Sunday, relatives heard about the phone call from Jimenez's sister, who said that when she tried to call her brother back, he would not pick up, according to Jazmin Carrera.

According to officials, Jimenez was previously arrested for domestic violence in another city in a case that did not involve Carrera. Police do not know what Jimenez does for a living, although he was last known to be driving a black 2006 Maserati with Illinois license plate L641441.

Authorities made a plea to Jimenez to turn himself in ‘for the sake of his family and especially his children,’ Ford said.

Investigators do not believe Jimenez is a danger to others, although they say they have no way of knowing his current state of mind.
