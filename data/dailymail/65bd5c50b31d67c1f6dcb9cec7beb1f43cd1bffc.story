The perfectly-preserved remains of a sandwich have been found inside a church organ 118 years after being left there by workmen.

Slices of crusty bread were found wrapped in a paper bag, which was sealed within the instrument when it was built in 1896.

The meal - thought to have been eaten with cheese by workers on their lunch break - was only found when the organ was being dismantled to be sold for parts.

Still good? The slices of bread were found inside a church organ in Burnley - where they had been for 118 years

Accompaniment: The bread was found alongside crinkled pages of the Stockport Advertiser from 1896

Church organist Kath Yates found the bread alongside a copy of a local newspaper dated to 1896 as the instrument was being taken apart in Padiham Road Methodist Church in Burnley, Lancashire.

The package was preserved in the inner workings of the organ, within a soundproofed area sealed with wood, which also seems to have protected the meal from the elements.

It was stashed away with pages from the Stockport Advertiser, the newspaper from the area where the organ was built.

Her husband Peter Yates, the church property steward said: 'The bread has been perfectly preserved. It must have been the remains of a lunch for the organ-fitters who I imagine sat down for a butty break.

'I can just picture them sat reading the paper with their sandwich and perhaps a large hunk of cheese. They were found in the swell box of the organ when we took the inner layer out.

Find: The organ had stood in the Padiham Road Methodist Church in Burnley, Lancashire, for decades

Remains: The organ, built in 1896, was sold for parts to German buyers - pictured is what remains of it today

Old-time religion: The above picture shows the organ as it would have been during the church's heyday

'It was full of wooden shavings which gave out a beautiful smell of pine alongside this wonderful snapshot of history.' 

Parts for the two manual mechanical action pipe organ had been sold on eBay to bidders in Germany for £1,700.

The organ, which Mrs Yates played for more than 30 years, originally belonged to the former Claremont Methodist Church, also in Burnley, but was brought over when the two churches merged.

The instrument was sold to fund redevelopment work at the church.

Mr Yates added: 'The organ was a wonderful piece of workmanship and it will be missed but we have to move on.

Innards: The remnants were found inside the organ in a part sealed by thick wood to make it soundproof

'We hope to display the newspaper cuttings but we suspect that the bread will perish now its been removed from inside the organ.' 

'Inside part of the organ there's a huge empty box which is like a huge void. It has to be completely sealed to stop the sound from leaking out so it's covered by what I call Victorian plywood, which is like a thin skin of wood.

'This is how the sandwich has been so well preserved - it's been protected from the elements. It really was an amazing find.

After the discovery, the organ was dismantled and transported to Germany, where its interior and pipework will be re-installed in a church near Munich.
