People smugglers are offering 'kids travel free deals' to asylum seekers as well as discount prices on boat trips to Australia, says the chief of the border protection command.

Operation Sovereign Borders commander, Lieutenant General Angus Campbell said the government's toughened border policies had made people smugglers desperate to make money.

'[There are] much reduced prices, special deals, and some smugglers offering kids to travel for free: all this and more, to put people’s lives at risk, in small boats on a large ocean,' General Campbell said.

Kids go free: People smugglers are offering 'kids travel free' deals to asylum seekers and discount boat trips to Australia since border protection rules changes

Neverending flow: Border protection chief Lt General Angus Campbell (above) says desperate people smugglers will make money anyway they can and the flow of people seeking refuge across the world had reached 232 million, three per cent of the world's population, and showed no sign of abating

In his first speech since taking over Australia's border protection and the Abbott Government's new strategies regarding detention centres on the island of Nauru and in Papua New Guinea, General Campbell said international syndicates were looking for any gaps in policy to exploit the nation's borders.

'The ability of people to travel—through a range of both regular and irregular means—has never been greater,' he said.

  Operation Sovereign Borders launched in September 2013 with these key components to stop asylum seeker boats to Australia:

•    No onshore processing of refugees and increased offshore centres

•    Expanded customs fleet and disruption of boat activity 

•    Improved air/sea military surveillance

•    Regional awareness campaign that people smuggling is criminal and illegal boat people cannot stay on Australia soil

•    Boat buy back programme to discourage sale of vessels to smugglers

•    Intelligence scheme to uncover smuggling operations and bounty payments for arrests

•    Lifeboats for refugees to thwart scuttle attempts, demands for Australian rescues and allow boat people to safely turn back

'This trend shows no signs of abating. There are too many prospective travellers susceptible to believing that Nauru is a town in Australia.'

He said the number of people crossing international borders had grown from about 77 million in 1960 to about 232 million in 2013, or just over three per cent of the world's population.

Addressing the Australian Strategic Policy Institute on Thursday night, he said the Operation Sovereign Borders team had 'greatly disrupted maritime people smuggling to Australia'.

'Business is down, but smugglers will keep trying because they hope to turn a profit. As with combating other forms of organised crime, our determination and long term perseverance is essential to effectively dealing with this wicked problem.'

While no boatload of refugees had successfully arrived in Australia for five months, his job was far from over.

'The benefits to date, while real, are modest,' he said. 'Substantially changing the irregular flow toward Australia and drawing down the pool of potential illegal immigrants in transit countries will require years, not months, of collective regional effort.

'To modify a well-known and very apt phrase, the price of border security is eternal vigilance.'

Gen Campbell said he would not be heading the new $480.5 million super front-line agency, Border Force Australia, which would take over border protection in July 2015.

He expected the Syrian conflict would continue to drive refugees across borders into other countries.
