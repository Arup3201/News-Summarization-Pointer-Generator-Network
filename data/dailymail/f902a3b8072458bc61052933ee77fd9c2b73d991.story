All along they were adamant that Alastair Cook would captain England at the World Cup.

That his painfully long run without a decent 50-over score would come to an end and that everything would be fine once he got to Australia on harder, faster pitches. Now all that has dramatically changed.

What an extraordinary U-turn the England selectors performed on Friday night in snatching the captaincy away from the man they have invested so much in. What a last-gasp change of heart before the biggest tournament in one-day cricket.

It will be portrayed as a brave decision, one with the best interests of Cook at heart, but in truth it is embarrassing that England have been forced to take drastic action just weeks before February’s World Cup.

Only this week, the day before England slumped to the final defeat in their 5-2 loss to Sri Lanka, managing director Paul Downton said that he would be ‘very surprised’ if Cook was replaced. Three days later he has gone.

They were supposed to have four years to plan for this. Four years to make sure that this World Cup will not be as miserable for England as the last five when they have fallen woefully short of the 50-over standards now required.

Now, in little more than two weeks, England will be leaving for Australia and the triangular series that precedes the World Cup with a new captain and seemingly little idea of their best way to spring a monumental surprise.

How did it come to this? Well, in truth England have never been as sure that Cook was the right man to lead the one-day team as they were that he should captain them in Test cricket after the tumultuous events of the last year.

Cook's form was horrendous as the England captain hadn't scored an ODI century since June 2012

Cook, after all, is predominantly a Test batsman, just as Nasser Hussain, Michael Vaughan and Andrew Strauss were when they led England into World Cups. It has always been the English way to put Test cricket first and then have a think about what used to be known as the hit-and-giggle stuff.

But Cook is widely respected in the dressing room and has created, along with coaches Peter Moores and Paul Farbrace, the more positive team culture that England felt was woefully lacking when they were thrashed 5-0 in Australia.

So, any reservations England had about Cook’s one-day form — which has been dismal since the last of his five 50-over centuries two-and-a-half years ago — were shelved when they considered what was ahead.

The two new white balls used in one-day cricket and the back-foot conditions that await in Australia would play, they believed, to Cook’s strengths.

Yet he has been unable to reproduce the form that saw him confound the doubters when he took over from Strauss after the last World Cup and led England to the top of the one-day rankings and the Champions Trophy final.

Now it seems that England will be heading to the World Cup with a captain in Eoin Morgan who has been in even worse form than Cook and looks a shadow of the man who became one of the best one-day batsmen in the world.

Personally, given that England would probably have little hope at this World Cup even if they had a captain with the talent of Don Bradman and the tactical acumen of Mike Brearley, I would have plumped for Joe Root.

After all, there is little for England to lose and, I understand, the plan was always to replace Cook with Root at the helm of the 50-over team at the end of this World Cup, just as Mike Atherton, Alec Stewart, Hussain, Vaughan and Strauss have all departed as one-day captains after the biggest tournament.

Now Cook’s departure has been spectacularly brought forward and England feel it would be asking too much of such an inexperienced captain to step into the breach in the most important one-day show of them all.

And one of England’s best ever batsmen has been forced to accept that he will never get to play, let alone be captain, in a World Cup. And that is a shame apart from anything else for a decent man and world-class performer.
