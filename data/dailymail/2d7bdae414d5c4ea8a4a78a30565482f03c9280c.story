The daughter called police around 5 pm Friday after she got away from her enraged father.

Cynthia, who taught nursing at nearby Weber State University, had filed for divorce from her husband on Aug. 25, and sought a restraining order from him at the same time according to the Standard-Examiner.

It is not known at this point why she wanted a restraining order, though coworkers seem to think it may have had something to do with a domestic abuse situation.

'She did fear for her life but it had only been over the past few months, it was a sudden change that had taken place in her family life,' said Susan Thornton, chair of the Weber State School of Nursing.

Others say she wanted to keep her husband from touching her savings account and retirement fund. 

One neighbor, Jalene Ward, told Fox 13 Salt Lake City that Richard admitted he struggled with depression at times.

It is also not known yet why Richard became angry enough at his daughter Heather to shoot the recent college graduate.

She was treated at a local hospital and released. 

The couple also had two other children, a son Bryan and a daughter Stephanie. They also had a granddaughter.

'She was one of the sweetest gentlest persons that I’ve ever met,' Thornton said of Cynthia.
