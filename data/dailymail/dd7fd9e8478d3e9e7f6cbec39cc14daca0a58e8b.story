In front of the cameras she appeared determined and focused as she fought to win The Apprentice.

But Laura Hogg has revealed the secret anguish that blighted her time on the BBC programme.

Unknown to viewers, while she was filming the show she was given the devastating news that the father of her son had been murdered.

Secret heartbreak: Laura Hogg, right, found out that the father of her child Chris Lindsay, left, had been murdered while she was filming The Apprentice

Miss Hogg described the moment she was
told as the ‘worst moment’ of her life – but kept her grief to herself 
while she competed on the programme.

However, days later she was fired by Lord Sugar, in scenes shown to viewers this week.

Miss Hogg said: ‘When you hear that 
someone you cared for deeply – and who did something as amazing as 
giving you a child – has gone through that ordeal it hurts like mad. It 
was really disturbing.’

The 28-year-old was taken aside during
filming in October and told that her former partner, Chris Lindsay, had
been killed in a vicious street attack in the Costa del Sol.

The pair were in a relationship for two years before separating eight weeks after the birth of their son Reece, now four.

The exact circumstances surrounding the 34-year-old’s death during a work trip to Spain remain a mystery.

The salesman became separated from colleagues and was later found on the roadside, viciously beaten.

He never regained consciousness and died from liver failure five days later in hospital.

Coping with the pain: Laura said she will never know if the devastating news 'affected her performance' on the BBC show

Miss Hogg, who owns a bridal boutique 
in Edinburgh, was told the news by a producer when she was taken aside 
from her teammates as they made vats of chutney for one of the show’s 
tasks.

She said: ‘I was in an absolute state 
of shock. I just wanted someone to pinch me. I couldn’t speak. It was 
like something from a film.’

Despite her grief, she put herself 
forward as project manager for her team’s next task – and it was after 
this that she was fired.

In scenes shown this week, Lord Sugar sent her home for failing to secure enough sales in the art dealing challenge.

Miss Hogg admitted she did not know 
if Mr Lindsay’s murder affected her performance, but said she did not 
want to use it as an excuse.

Initially, she kept the revelation a 
secret from fellow hopefuls on the show, but after the cameras stopped 
rolling one night, she broke down in tears in front of other 
contestants.

She said that although Mr Lindsay was 
not involved in his son’s life and she had no relationship with his 
family, she was heartbroken by the news and considered leaving the show 
to attend the funeral, but decided against it.

She told The Sun: ‘If Chris had been 
involved in Reece’s life I’d have been home in a flash. But I thought me
going back wasn’t going to influence the situation.

‘I wanted my little boy to have a dad 
but it became apparent after Reece was born that we were never going to 
have a happy family.’

Miss Hogg has been with her current boyfriend, Ali, for four years.
