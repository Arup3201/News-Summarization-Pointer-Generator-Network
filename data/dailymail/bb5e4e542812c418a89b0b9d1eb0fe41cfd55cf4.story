It's a race against time for rescuers as they desperately search for people buried after heavy rain caused mudslides that have already claimed 20 lives in south western Japan.

The torrential rain continued to fall as police, firefighters and troops dug through mud and rubble with shovels after ‘unprecedented’ downpours swamped whole neighbourhoods yesterday.

Television footage showed torrents of muddy water carrying uprooted trees and other debris in a violent deluge, while rivers burst their banks and flooded towns and villages in Kyushu, the southern island of Japan.

Landslides and fallen trees cut roads and water supplies in several places, with at least one small mountain community completely cut off, the local government said.

It's only contact so far has been with a Japanese military helicopter which dropped off supplies including food and water.

Several dead: 19 people are confirmed dead and more missing in the city of Aso in Kumamoto Prefecture where scenes like this are widespread

More rain to come: Many roads and houses were cut off in the city of Aso where more rain is predicted to fall

In the city of Aso in Kumamoto 
Prefecture, central Kyushu, landslides buried at least 17 households, 
killing 19 people with six more still missing, local officials said.

Kumamoto
prefectural official Yushin Maekawa said: ‘We will keep searching for 
the missing throughout the night, while urging our citizens to stand 
guard as heavy rain continues sporadically.’

More
than 250 households were told to evacuate, while everyone living on the
floodplain of the Shirakawa River in Kumamoto City was advised to get 
to safety.

Treacherous search: Police and defence personnel search for missing people in Taketa in the Oita Prefecture

In Oita, Oita Prefecture an elderly man died after being swept into a raging river, while another man remained missing.

The
city of Hita, Oita prefecture, ordered more than 14,800 peope to evacuate amid increasing fears the Kagetsugawa River, which runs 
through the city, would burst its banks, local officials said.

Nearly 25,000 people in other parts of the prefecture were advised to seek safety, the officials said.

The
weather eased somewhat this morning bringing only temporary relief as further downpours fell in Kyushu later in the day.

Reports showed residential streets in the city of Kumamoto covered in mud, while battered cars were swept away by flood water and left dumped on hillsides in scenes reminiscent of the March 2011 tsunami in the northeast.

The weather agency urged residents of Kyushu to be vigilant against mudslides and floods after rainfall of about four inches an hour was recorded in the southern region of Kagoshima earlier today.

The weather agency forecast has estimated 20 centimetres of rainfall in the northern Kyushu region by Saturday morning.
