A father of the bride died from a suspected heart attack on a go-karting track during his future son-in-law's stag weekend.

Former rugby league player Lee Thompson, 55, from Walney, Cumbria, was with his daughter's fiance Ben Houghton when he suddenly pulled over to the side of the track and was found slumped over the steering wheel.

He died hours later at Leeds General Infirmary with his family by his side on Friday, March 9.

They now face the agonising prospect of gathering for his funeral next week, before his 26-year-old daughter Victoria's wedding at The Grange Hotel in Cumbria the week after.

Tragedy: Bride-to-be Victoria, pictured centre at her graduation with her father Lee, sister Natalie, and mother Pat, wants the wedding to go ahead as planned

She was too distressed to speak, but wants her wedding to go ahead as planned over the Easter weekend, even though her father will not be there to walk her down they aisle.

Her mother Pat Thompson, a clinical support worker, said: 'Lee was working on his wedding day speech
and would have been so proud to walk Victoria down the aisle and he 
would have enjoyed the day. The wedding will go 
ahead, Lee wouldn't want anything different.'

The stag group - which included Mr Thompson's other future son-in-law to be Chris McIroy, who is engaged to his daughter Natalie - were at a go-karting track in Leeds when tragedy struck.

After two or three laps, Mr Thompson pulled over to the side of the track without warning.

A red warning flag went up immediately to stop the race showing his go-kart number 11.

Mr McIroy said: 'We knew it was one of our team members and realised something was not right.

'A paramedic was on the scene right 
away and gave him CPR. He was rushed to hospital and with
Ben, Victoria and myself at his side he was given further attention for
a further two hours before he passed away.'

Tributes: A former rugby league player, Mr Thompson (pictured with wife Pat) collapsed at the go-karting track from a suspected heart attack

Mrs Thompson, who was working at Furness General Hospital at the time, was collected by daughter Natalie as the pair raced down to Leeds to be at his bedside before he passed away.

She said she was thankful her husband was not alone before he died.

'When we arrived at the hospital we were met by a nurse and taken into see Lee, I just broke down,' she said.

'He was never 
on his own as Chris, Ben and Victoria were at his side and we said our 
goodbyes. All through the journey we heard no news on Lee and we feared the worst. Lee was so proud of his daughters.'

Tributes flooded in from those who knew Mr Thompson, a project leader at BAE Systems in Barrow, from his days playing rugby league and coaching at Barrow Island.

Russ Walker, a colleague and former 
teammate, said: 'Lee was not only a good friend but a good rugby player,
he had the respect of others around him. I am the godfather of Natalie 
and we had many good times together. It is so sad.'

Mr Thompson's funeral will be held on Friday, March 22, a week before his daughter's wedding at the Grange Hotel in Cumbria.
