Strolling down the sunny Californian streets, Connor Cruise and his friend Alanna Masters look like two average all-American kids.

But as the son of Tom Cruise, arguably Scientology’s most esteemed member, Connor, 18, is the ‘worst person’ for  Alanna to become close to, according to her father.

Joe Reaiche, 55, who has not seen his two children for the past nine years since being ex-communicated from the church, told MailOnline: ‘If there is any chance that Alanna is connected to Connor, he is the worst person for her to be around. The more she’s around him, the deeper into the church she goes.

The former Australian rugby league player joined Scientology in 1978 and left in 2005 – and has since then been an outspoken critic of the mysterious religion.

And he said he was wary of A list star Tom mainly because of his close friendship to Scientology leader David Miscavige, adding: ‘Tom and David are like twins – they’re like two peas in a pod. 

'I think Tom he has turned a blind eye to issues with his church. And they have been very careful not to show him the dark side.’

Joe was a professional footballer and almost 20 when he joined Scientology after he believed the church had healed a long-running groin injury.

He married fellow Scientologist Carol Masterson in 1985, the mother of actors Danny and Christopher Masterson, and the couple went on to have a son Jordan, now 27, and Alanna, now 25.

 'Tom Cruise and David Miscavige are like twins - they're like two peas in a pod...I think Tom has turned a blind eye to issues with his church'

Following the breakdown of his marriage, Joe, a plain-speaking Aussie who now lives in Long Island, New York, started to question the church and the religion that had been part of his life for so long.

After '18 years of constant learning and exorbitant costs’, Joe estimates he had paid out to ‘close to $400,000’ on Scientology services and sources for him and his wife.

Joe told how the couple were invited to an event in Clearwater in 1996 by David Miscaviage where he alleges they were informed the church had developed a ‘more exact approach to the Spritual Bridge of Total Freedom and corrected the system, therefore all prior spiritual services or courses that were done by you over the last 18 years was incorrect and hindered your results. ‘

This new system was called The Golden Age of technology and would cost another $20,000 for Joe and Carol to correct the past.

The tipping point came, said Joe, when he was on business in Atlanta and was called by one of the Church’s executives in New York’s ‘Justice Division’ and ordered to arrive in New York within 24 hours – or he would be considered a Supressive Person for non-compliance.

This, Joe said, he simply did not want to comply to – and was indeed told to leave.

Alanna, now a striking brunette who has most recently been dating DJ Jesse Marco, and her siblings were educated within Scientology, as were Connor and his sister Isabella.

And and records show she – alongside her mother and brothers – have each donated $35,000 of their own money to the church to reach Cornerstone status within the past few years.

Being shut out of the church in 2005 meant that Joe has not seen his children – including the step-sons he helped raise – for the past nine years.

Indeed, he only found out about his daughter’s friendship with Connor Cruise after following her on Twitter.

'If my daughter has a brain, she 
should say ‘how can my father be an evil person?' Is Leah Remini evil? 
Come on! Could all of these people be lying about the church?'

‘I have to follow my kids on Twitter because all my photos are with my ex-wife, I never thought I would have to be digging for photos of them online,’ said Joe.

‘And then someone contacted me to let me know a picture had gone viral of her with Connor Cruise.

‘If Alanna is hanging around with someone like Connor, it will be very hard to realise what is wrong with the church – and want to leave.’

Joe, who last week told Scientology blogger Tony Ortega: ‘ I call Tom the Prince of Darkness — he’s got a warped view of Scientology and I don’t want my daughter anywhere near him’ – said he had been prompted to speak out in the wake of Leah Remini’s departure from Scientology last week.

He said: ‘Leah is a strong girl with a ton of money, I knew her when she was 17 and she’s  a b***h on wheels if you p**s her off!

‘I’m in the position now where I have to keep a Google alert for my children, they won’t take my phone calls, they won’t accept cards.

‘If my daughter has a brain, she should say ‘how can my father be an evil person? Is Leah Remini evil? Come on! Could all of these people be lying about the church?

‘Her mother is a staunch supporter and once they have their hooks in you, there’s no remorse.’

‘I’m not perfect’, admitted Joe, who has remained single since his divorce, ‘I did mistakes, but does that make me evil? I fathered these children and raised my two step-sons and I hope one day they wake up and smell the coffee.

‘I grew up in Australia, I was beaten up because I was a foreigner and I fought in the Beirut Civil War, I’m a tough cookie.

‘But it is sad not to see my kids, to realise that I might now be able to walk my daughter down the aisle – it’s heartbreaking. But I could walk away and say I raised those kids with the best of my ability and I never abused them and I loved them.’

Now working in finance, Joe stressed: ‘No religion has the right to ruin you and split up your family.’
