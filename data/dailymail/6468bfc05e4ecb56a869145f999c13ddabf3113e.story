The Turkish FA are exploring the possibility of West Ham teenager Oscar Borg pledging his allegiance to Turkey.

The 16-year-old left-back, who had a spell training at Manchester United earlier this summer only for a deal to fall through, has agreed a two year scholarship with West Ham. 

Borg has been touted as a promising wing-back and that has alerted Turkish football officials.

There could be a tug-of-war over Oscar Borg's international future if he is eligible to play for Turkey 

They have learned that the teenager's grandmother was born in Istanbul and are checking whether he is eligible to play international football for them. 

It has been suggested that should Borg commit to Turkey, offers from the country's biggest clubs such as Galatasray, Fenerbahce and Besiktas would follow suit. 

Getting Borg, who has drawn comparisons to the world's most expensive player Gareth Bale, to commit himself to a professional contract has been a coup for West Ham. 

But Manchester United are said to be sniffing around another promising young Hammers defender in 15-year-old Reece Oxford.  

Reece Oxford is another West Ham youngster who has been linked with Manchester United
