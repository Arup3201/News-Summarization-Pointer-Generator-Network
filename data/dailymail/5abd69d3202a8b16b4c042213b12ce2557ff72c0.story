Rapid decline: Trainee hairdresser Laura Garner (pictured) died in hospital after medical staff twice failed to give her antibiotics ordered by her doctor

A teenager died in hospital after medical staff twice failed to give her antibiotics ordered by her doctor in the 24 hours before her death, an inquest heard yesterday.

Laura Garner, 18, died from an acute infection after being admitted to Bradford Royal Infirmary the previous night suffering from abdominal pain.

A senior duty doctor recommended the trainee hairdresser be given an antibiotic when she was first admitted.

Surgeon Abid Hassan Mohammed Salih returned for his night shift the next day and prescribed another antibiotic when he discovered tests for appendicitis were negative.

This second antibiotic drug was to treat a possible urinary infection.

But the court heard no-one wrote a prescription for the antibiotic on the first night, despite it being detailed in the medical notes, and although the alternative medication was prescribed on the second night, it was never administered.

Mr Salih said: ‘It was normal procedure at the time that one of my junior doctors would deal with the prescribing.’

He admitted: ‘If this had happened today it would have been very different.

'We have different practices now. The doctor who prescribes the medication would also write it up.

But that was the way the system operated at that time.’

The surgeon said Laura had showed signs of improvement. He said she seemed ‘fine’ and was ‘smiling’ before being transferred from the acute ward to a recovery ward.

They had a conversation and she walked unaided to her bed, he said.

'Very unusual case': Miss Garner, 18, suddenly died just over 24 hours after being admitted to Bradford Royal Infirmary in September 2009, the inquest heard

The inquest in Bradford heard how she suddenly died just over 24 hours after being admitted to the hospital in September 2009.

Questions to answer: Miss Garner had an abnormally high heart rate and high temperature, but staff did not increase the frequency of their observations of her, the coroner was told

When she was moved to the new ward 
shortly after midnight the crash team were called and 30 minutes of 
resuscitation failed to bring her back to life.

Her parents Steve and Anne Garner were called at 12.20am at home in Baildon, West Yorkshire, to say that their daughter had died.

Breaking down when giving her evidence, Mrs Garner said: ‘I became really upset, I was screaming.

'I just didn’t believe them. How could she be dead? ‘She had died alone, she was by herself.’

A post mortem revealed she died of septicaemia and a bacterial infection of the kidney.

John Griffith, a consultant surgeon who was looking after Laura during the day, said he had never seen a case like it.

Mr Griffith said: ‘In 12 years of consulting I have never seen a case progress like Laura’s.

'It was very, very unusual and very tragic for everyone involved.’

The teenager had an abnormally high heart rate and high temperature while in hospital, but staff did not increase the frequency of their observations of her.

When questioned by coroner Paul Marks, ward manager Angela Hurtault said she couldn’t explain why this was not done.

Nine months after Laura’s tragic death her parents launched a legal action against the hospital trust.

The hearing continues.
