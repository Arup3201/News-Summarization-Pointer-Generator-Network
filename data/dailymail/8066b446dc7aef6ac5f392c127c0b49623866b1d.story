The taxman is seeking official permission to break the speed limit like the emergency services under a new initiative launched by ministers.

And so is 007.

HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) wants to join the police, fire, and ambulance and ‘life-saving’  999 crews who have a special exemption from obeying the speed limit.

Breaking the limit: HM Revenue and Customs are among the organisations calling for an exemption on speed limits

Life savers: At present only the emergency services are afforded the right to break the speed limit

The proposals, now out for consultation, examine the possibility of extending speed limit exemptions to other services apart from police, fire and ambulance.

These would include those carrying organs for transplant, bomb disposal units, the blood transfusion service, mountain and mine rescue, radiation emergencies, coastguard and RNLI lifeboat launching services.

But nestling in the small print of a 90 page consultation document published by the Department for Transport – and conspicuous by its absence in an accompanying press release -  the report notes: ‘HM Revenue and Customs are seeking exemptions from speed limits for its covert surveillance vehicles.’

It adds: ‘Customs surveillance operations mirror the activities of the police service and they have extensive arrest and investigatory powers.’

Legalising: Although James Bond, seen her in an Aston Martin, may be used to high speed car chases the Security Services are only just asking to be exempt from speed restrictions

The AA raised an eyebrow at the inclusion of the taxman seeking permission to speed so close to the Chancellor George Osborne’s autumn statement on December 5 when he is under pressure to ditch a planned 3p a litre tax rise.

An AA spokesman said: ‘It is surprising. But if the taxman is racing around above the speed-limit, he or she will quickly feel the pain of rising pump prices already felt by 33 million motorists.’

But the consultation paper notes: ‘HMRC are involved in covert surveillance of major organised crime.

‘Nationally there are approximately 10 concurrent operational deployments per day involving 500 officers from the criminal Investigation Directorate.’

Difference between life and death: Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said it is about time they started top look at exemptions for other services

The DfT consultation will also look 
at amending road safety legislation so that emergency drivers would be 
required by law to complete high-speed training before exceeding the 
limit.

But this will 
not place any additional burden on police, fire and ambulance services 
which already run an effective voluntary training scheme, it said.

HMRC officers are given ‘blue light’ training, but not speed training, it added.

Those used to seeing James Bond 
thrashing his Aston Martin in high speed chases on the big screen may be
 intrigued to learn of the intention to also bring the Security Services
 under the umbrella of exemptions.

The report notes: ‘Due to the sensitive nature of the covert operations, public information is limited. However, the Department is content that the internal procedures set out by the services are of the highest standard.’

Meanwhile, Bomb Squad units currently respond to 3,500 call outs a year of which 30 per cent are explosive devices.

Road Safety Minister Stephen Hammond said: ‘Police, fire and ambulance service drivers are highly trained individuals who are at times required to exceed the speed limit in order to save lives.

‘It is only right that we look at allowing other services whose duties can mean the difference between life and death to exceed the speed limit when responding to emergencies.

‘It is also time to look at the legal requirements of emergency vehicle training so we can build on the rigorous standards the police, fire and ambulance services have already applied through their code of practice.’

‘While emergency service drivers are not exempt from the offences of dangerous and careless driving, the current legislation allows drivers in some circumstances to break speed limits legally as well as exempting them from certain traffic regulations.

The consultation closes on February 27, 2013.
