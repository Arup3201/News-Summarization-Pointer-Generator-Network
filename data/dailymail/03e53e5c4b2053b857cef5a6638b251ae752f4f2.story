While pandas are often the main attraction at zoos, the adorable animals do not usually attempt to entertain visitors by playing a musical instrument.

But as this comical picture shows, this bear appeared to be doing just that as she held a bamboo stick up to her face as if she was playing the flute.

Crowds gathered around the panda enclosure at Taihu Lake National Wetland Park in Suzhou, in the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu, as one of the female bears put on the adorable show.

Eats flutes and leaves: A giant panda at a zoo in China looked like it was playing the musical instrument as it held a bamboo branch up to its face

Holding the bamboo in her paws in the same fashion a musician would do with a flute, she paused to lick the branch, apparently unaware of visitors to the zoo crowding around her pen.

The black and white giant panda then started gnawing on the bamboo branch - a staple in the bears' diet.

Giant pandas, which are native to central China but are often kept in captivity to encourage the endangered species to breed, eat between one and five stone of bamboo branches, stems and shoots every day.

Female giant pandas can reach up to 19 stone, but those in the wild often weigh  less as deforestation has led to bamboo being harder to find.

There are thought to be slightly less than 2,000 pandas left in the wild, a number which has gradually increased since the 1960s after international efforts to save the species were increased.

As well as this, there are about 240 giant pandas in captivity in China, while 49 live in zoos around the world, including two at Edinburgh Zoo.
