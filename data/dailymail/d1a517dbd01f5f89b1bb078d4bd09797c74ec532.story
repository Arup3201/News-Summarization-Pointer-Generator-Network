A couple have claimed that their three daughters were indoctrinated into a religious cult by their school teachers leaving them with suicidal thoughts and alienated from their loving family, according to a new lawsuit.

The couple, from Avon, Connecticut, filed the civil lawsuit in federal court on Monday against the Avon school district, three teachers and a guidance counselor at Avon High School and Wellesley College in Massachusetts. 

The parents alleged that their older daughters, now aged 22 and 19, became 'reclusive, secretive and distant' after they began taking Spanish classes at Avon High.

The named defendants are Connecticut residents Tanya Mastoloni (also known as Tanya Romero), Rebecca Kessler; Laura Sullivan and California resident Christopher Esposito.

The parents have filed a lawsuit against teachers and a guidance counselor at Avon High School in Connecticut claiming their teenage daughters were indoctrinated into a cult

The parents are known only in the lawsuit as Jane and John Doe.

Their girls began having 'fantasies of suicidal ideation and martyrdom', according to the suit.

They also began to speak in a strange language and gathered at Wellesley College in Massachusetts to perform religious 'whirling dervish' dances throughout the night.

The couple claimed that the teachers and counselor indoctrinated their daughters into a cult that promotes martyrdom and celebrates death. 

The couple said their daughters became secretive, lost their good humor and empathy and began speaking a bizarre language. The girls are also unable to think critically or independently, the lawsuit claimed.

The parents noticed that their second daughter began to change in the same way as her older sister when she took classes with the same Spanish teacher, Tanya Mastoloni.

The teachers, along with a guidance counselor, encouraged the girl to join her older sister at Wellesley so they could all meet up there. The indoctrination by the teachers reportedly continued when two of the girls went to Wellesley College.

According to the 64-page lawsuit, the youngest daughter was also targeted to be indoctrinated into the same belief system, but she broke free. She has jointly filed the lawsuit with her parents.

The two elder sisters have had no contact with their family since last July along with their extended family and friends at the urging of the group of teachers, it is claimed.

According to the suit, they reported their parents as abusive to be allowed to remain at Wellesley College over the summer vacation.

The teachers, in particular Mastoloni, preyed on students who lacked social skills and were shy, the parents claimed.

The Does' lawsuit said that the defendants pose a serious threat to the community and the public because of the influence they have over impressionable students.

In the lawsuit, the parents claimed that their eldest daughter, identified only as E.D., is an extremely gifted young woman but socially awkward, preferring to spend time with adults than with people her own age. She was bullied in elementary and middle schools, which made starting high school a stressful experience for her.

The parents noted that their daughter is fluent in Spanish, having studied it from fifth grade and having a flair for languages. This caught the eye of the group of teachers, who were known as the 'Tri-State' at Avon High - because one was from New York, the other from New Jersey and the third from Connecticut.

The parents claimed that the three women, along with Esposito, acted like a clique, favoring certain students over others. The lawsuit claimed that they socialized with students and shared inappropriate stories about boyfriends. Mastoloni would also pry about students' personal lives and offer to interpret their dreams.

Defendant Mastoloni veered from the Spanish curriculum and taught her students about spirituality, numerology, astrology, dreams and angels in her classes, the lawsuit claimed.

She asked students to write essays about what they believed happened to them when they died - but because the writing was in Spanish, people outside the class were unaware of the inappropriate subject matter.

According to the suit, Mastoloni told her class about her abusive upbringing, including stories of an alleged kidnapping and rape by her stepfather.

The parents' lawsuit alleges that the girls were up all night performing 'whirling dervish' dances at Wellesley College, following their personality changes

The teacher also alienated the oldest
 girl from the boyfriend she had in her sophomore year of high school, 
the lawsuit said, claiming he was not a 'man'. The couple broke up after
 a year.

During her 
final year when she had turned 18, the friendship became more intense, 
it is alleged. Mastoloni asked a lot of questions about ED's family and 
wanted to come round for dinner. Esposito, it is claimed, once asked ED 
about the sexual orientation of her sisters.

When ED went off to study at Wellesley, the teacher allegedly began visiting her former pupil. The parents' lawsuit claimed that their daughter developed an obsessive friendship towards her roommate, named as Naureen in documents, who eventually had to move out of their shared room and seek counseling.

The lawsuit claimed that during her first year at university, ED and other girls would go to Alumni Hall on campus and would 'dance, sing and perform ''whirling dervishes'' - religious dances - until the wee hours of the morning'.

The parents claim that their daughter's new personality was 'the direct result of the religious indoctrination she had been subjected to by Defendants Mastoloni, Kessler, Esposito, and Sullivan'.

The couple alleged that their daughter switched her major due to Mastoloni's influence, moving from an interest in political science or international relations to philosophy. She also told her parents she wanted to do a masters in Divinity, according to the lawsuit.

The lawsuit stated: 'E.D. was constantly talking about ''seeking the truth'' and pursuing a ''greater purpose''.'

During the Thanksgiving holiday of her sophomore year, the couple claimed that their daughter had clear signs of an altered personality - acting flat and humorless, giving people strange looks and keeping her distance from family members.

When E.D.'s sister, who is identified as L.D. in the lawsuit, began taking Mastoloni's Spanish class in her senior year of high school, the parents claim that she underwent a personality change. The parents claim that the two sisters began to compete for the teacher's affections.

The parents alleged that the teachers and guidance counselor persuaded L.D. to attend the same college as her sister despite the fact she was previously reluctant.

The lawsuit claims: 'When E.D. and L.D. both came home for Christmas break in 2012, they were closer to each other than they had previously been, and they began isolating the rest of the family.'

Over several months, this behavior intensified the lawsuit said. The sisters would engage in no conversation other than about their teacher, would spend hours on their laptops and would disappear for hours on 'walks'.

When the siblings' youngest sister joined Mastoloni's Spanish class, she experienced the same discussions as her sisters about 'synchronicity', 'signs', the truth, angels and death, the lawsuit claimed.

The parents claimed that Mastoloni took a special interest in their third daughter. The lawsuit stated: 'Defendant Mastoloni had already converted the two older Doe sisters, and now she was looking to add the third sister to her coven.'

The couple claim that the teacher tried to break her daughter down psychologically, giving her into trouble over grades in front of classmates and leaving her in tears.

The two elder sisters allegedly asked their sister to come to Wellesley during her spring vacation, at Mastoloni's insistence. After staying a week with their sisters, the parents said in the suit that their youngest daughter returned home 'cold, flat and serious'. She spent as little time with her parents as possible.

Having experienced such drastic changes in their elder daughters' behavior, the mother said she was able to break through to her younger daughter with crying, pleading and talking.

The lawsuit stated that the mother saw her daughter 'experience a sudden psychological release... she began crying uncontrollably'. 

It was then revealed that while at Wellesley, the youngest sister had been in the constant control of her eldest, who was acting at the behest of Mastoloni, the lawsuit claimed.

E.D. told her youngest sister that her relationships with her mother was poisonous and that she did not need her parents. During this time, the youngest sister said E.D. spent long periods of time on the phone to Mastoloni.

In the summer of 2013, the parents believe that the four defendants - Mastoloni, Kessler, Esposito and Sullivan - 'hatched a plan' to have the sisters move out of their family home for good.

The four made up a story about the girls being abused by their parents in order to obtain housing for the girls at Wellesley, the lawsuit said.

The parents also claimed in the lawsuit that the four defendants are providing their daughters with money.

Avon
 and Wellesley officials said that they're looking into the allegations. MailOnline was awaiting a response from the school superintendent on 
Friday.

He said in a previous statement: 'The district administration is in receipt of the complaint filed recently in federal court and is reviewing it at this time. No communications regarding that which is alleged in the complaint have been received in the past.

'We will continue to review the content of the complaint and have turned the matter over to our school district legal counsel.'

It is unclear 
today whether the defendants are still teaching at Avon High School but the 
school's website lists the three female teachers in a current staff 
directory.

Christopher Esposito was a Spanish teacher at Avon High School until 2011.

Attempts to reach the defendants were unsuccessful on Friday.
