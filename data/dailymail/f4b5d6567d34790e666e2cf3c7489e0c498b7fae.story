On the field Saturday night, Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck showed the world his power and leadership. In the locker room after the game, she showed the world his naked hind end.

The NFL star, who led his team to a stunning comeback victory over the Kansas City Chiefs, inadvertently appeared in the buff in a locker room picture tweeted by his teammate Pat McAfee.

Luck was, well, lucky, that a well-placed cell phone shielded his modesty from full view.

Oops: Andrew Luck, top left corner, was caught unawares - and unclothed - in this locker room picture tweeted y a teammate

Rally: Luck, 24, led his team to overcome a 28-point deficit and win

McAfee didn't even realize that Luck was in the frame - he was attempting to show a humorous picture of veteran kicker Adam Vinatieri wearing a collared shirt and sweater - with a towel wrapped around his waist - while he gave an interview.

An NBC Sports photographer caught the error. He retweeted the picture with the words, 'Umm oops?'

McAfee, the Colts' 26-year-old punter, soon spotted the mistake. 'Oh boy.. Half naked Andrew in the back of that last one.. He looked damn good though,' he tweeted.

Later, adding: 'I feel awful for that Luck photobomb.. Really thankful all his parts were covered.. And now I'm hoping the future HOFer (Hall of Famer) forgives the mistake.'

Luck's naked shot was likely one of the last things on his mind Saturday night.

The second-year NFL quarterback, 24, led the Colts to a 45-44 victory over the Chiefs - after rallying from a 38-10 deficit after halftime.

Luck's heroics - including throwing for 443 yards and four touchdowns - will no doubt go down as one of the best performances in NFL playoffs history.

Only twice before have teams rebounded from such a deficit in league history. In 1980, the San Francisco 49ers rallied from 28 points behind to beat the New Orleans Saints.

In 1992, the Buffalo Bills came back 32 points in the playoffs to beat the Houston Oilers.

Luck, a Texas native who graduated from Stanford University with a degree in architectural design after playing football there for four years, was drafted in the first round by the Indianapolis Colts.

He will face either Tom Brady and the New England Patriots or his Colts predecessor Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos next week in the first round of the divisional playoffs.
