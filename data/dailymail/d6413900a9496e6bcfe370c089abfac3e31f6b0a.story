Reduced alcohol wine has been presented by the government as the answer to the crisis of drink-related illness and even drunkenness among the middle classes.

Now, the major wine labels are introducing brands that typically come in at an alcohol content of 5.5per cent, which is less than half the normal figure.

Australian brands like Banrock Station and Blossom Hill are marketing the new low alcohol wines on the basis that customers can safely have a relaxing glass and still drive home.

Best of both worlds: Manufacturers of the low alcohol wine hope that drinkers will still be able to enjoy wine without the negative side effects

However, they are running up against a tide of opposition from both British wine experts and traditional producers in France and other parts of Europe.

For a drink that wants to be called wine is – under EU law – required to have a minimum alcohol content of at least 8.5per cent.

Trend: Miranda's Summer Light Shiraz will go on sale in Tesco in November for £4.99

British health minister, Earl Howe, is lobbying in Brussels to win a change in the definition, for there is a fear that these new low alcohol drinks will not succeed unless they are called wines.

The low alcohol wines are made in exactly the same way as traditional vintages, which come in at between 11per cent and 15per cent alcohol.

The change comes at the end of the process, when the alcohol is removed using a spinning centrifuge system or filtered out via a process called reverse osmosis.

However, renowned wine expert, Charles
Metcalfe, said: ‘The problem with removing the alcohol is that it takes
some of the flavour with it.

'You are left with something that really 
just does not taste like wine.’

The
Blossom Hill Vie and the Banrock Station Light White are both 5.5per 
cent alcohol and sell for £4.99 a bottle in leading supermarkets.

A
2013 Miranda Summer Light, which is made with Shiraz grapes, and a 2013
Miranda Summer Light, made with Sauvignon Blanc grapes, will go on sale
in Tesco in November for £4.99. Both are 5.5per cent.

Earl Howe claims that the market for low or reduced alcohol ‘wines’ has been increasingly rapidly.

He
insists that promoting low alcohol wines was in customers’ ‘best long 
term interests’, amid concerns over a rise in liver diseases and cancers
linked to alcohol consumption.

‘The
government has consistently made the case for change to the EU wine 
rules to permit reduced and de-alcoholised products to be called wines,’
he said.

However, Mr 
Metcalfe said: ‘This is the British government against the whole of wine
making Europe and there is no real chance of success.’

He
said there are some traditional wines that are relatively in low 
alcohol, for example some German types made with Reisling grapes and the
moscato wines from the north of Italy.

Mr Metcalfe said: ‘Of course it is a good idea for people to drink less alcohol.

‘There is a huge amount of 
alcohol-related disease, the road accidents, plus the aggressiveness and
violence, but, personally, I don’t believe that going for reduced 
alcohol wine is the best way to achieve a reduction in consumption.

‘Leave
wine alone. Drink naturally lower alcohol wine if you want to, 
otherwise don’t drink wine, beer and spirits, stick to water and fruit 
juice.

‘Don’t mess around with wine.’

Drinks industry expert at retail analysts, Mintel, Chris Wisson, said he sees a big future for these reduced alcohol wines.

‘I call them 'sessionable' wine. That means you can drink a lot in one session,’ he said.

‘We're not expecting them to be for connoisseurs. They're absolutely fine, but they won't blow your socks off.’
