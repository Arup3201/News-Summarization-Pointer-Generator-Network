There have been four incidents of children left in locked cars in Victoria as the temperatures topped 30C degrees.

In one, three children all aged under five, were left alone in a Geelong carpark - southwest of Melbourne.

All four happened in the 24 hours leading into early Saturday.

Paramedics have also responded to 18 heat-related incidents - 11 involving people aged over 65 - and 15 people needed hospital treatment.Â 

Many involved people collapsing in public or becoming exhausted after working in the heat of the day.

With even hotter conditions expected on Saturday, Ambulance Victoria State Health Commander Paul Holman has urged Victorians to better protect themselves and, particularly, children from the heat.

'We know that consecutive days of heat with warm nights like last night has an effect on the way that our bodies can recover, especially the infirm and the elderly,' Mr Holman added.

'It is never safe to leave anyone in cars. No exceptions. No excuses.'

Raging bushfires have been burning in Victoria since Friday, destroying one home in Moyston at the foothills of the Grampians in western Victoria.

Temperatures in regional Victoria are predicted to top 40C on Saturday and locals are urged to keep out of the sun and to drink plenty of water through the day.

They're also urged to check on elderly relative, friends and neighbours to ensure they're okay.

Meanwhile, a 21-year-old St Albans man drowned at Jan Juc beach, south of Geelong, on Friday as many tried to escape the heat with a dip in the sea.
