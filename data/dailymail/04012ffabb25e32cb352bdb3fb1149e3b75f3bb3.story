These photographs show the incredible views that will be on offer to guests at one of London's most hotly anticipated hotels when it opens later this year.

The Shangri-La hotel, At The Shard, will take up floors 34 to 52 in one of the world's tallest - and most famous - buildings, designed by Renzo Piano.

Initially expected to open this time last year, after a long wait the hotel will finally open its doors to guests on May 6.

In addition to its 202 guestrooms, each offering breath-taking views across the capital, the hotel also boasts an indoor swimming pool and a stylish cocktail bar - both found on its top floor.

At The Shard's reception is found on the 35th floor, and each room is said to be unique owing to the building's original shape.

With each guestroom featuring a floor-to-ceiling window, views across the River Thames, the Houses of Parliament, the City of London and other more distant landmarks are on offer.

Guests are also promised a body-contouring Shangri-La bed, Acqua Di Parma bathroom amenities and mirrors integrated with televisions in the 87-storey building, which opened in 2012.

In all, the hotel will open with 202 guestrooms, each offering breath-taking views across the capital

The hotel, which is said to have cost £40million to complete, stands over London Bridge station.

Although it formally opens in May, not all rooms in the hotel are expected to be available until the autumn.

Room prices start at around £450 a night per person, and suites - which include a personal butler service - are expected to cost up to £3,250.
