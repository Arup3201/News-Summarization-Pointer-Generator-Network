Scion: Eric Nederlander was arrested for violating a protection order when he allegedly pulled his girlfriend's hair

The most recent arrest of Broadway scion Eric Nederlander on Thursday is apparently the second time he attacked his girlfriend as more details about his allegedly aggressive past emerge.

In July of last year, Nederlander allegedly slammed his girlfriend Nancy Okun's head into the Plexiglass divider of a taxi during an argument and followed her up to her Greenwich Village apartment, outside of which he proceeded to punch and shove her.

Because Ms Okun, who had been dating Nederlander 'for years' at the time of the July 19 incident, decided not to prosecute, Nederlander was able to plead down to disorderly conduct and had to complete 26 weeks of anger management classes.

The latest incident, however, came after a fight late Thursday night when he allegedly pulled Ms Okun's hair while she was sleeping and accused her of cheating on him.

The New York Post reports he was arrested at the Greenwich Village apartment of his girlfriend Nancy Okun at 2.30am Friday morning, who prosecutors said had a limited order of protection against him.

Nederlander - better known as the first Mr Jessica Seinfeld - has denied the allegations and is out on $5,000 bond. His lawyer argued that he was not a flight risk because he was a life-long New Yorker.

The judge ordered a full order of protection, barring Nederlander from having any contact with the complainant.

The
46-year-old's marriage to Jessica Sklar - now Seinfeld - ended just 
three weeks in when she met Jerry Seinfeld at the gym, just days after 
returning from their honeymoon in Italy.

They married on Christmas day in 1999 and are still together.

Nederlander described this as a 'very difficult time' in his life.

Miss Okun, 31, told police he yanked her hair while she was sleeping and said: 'You're cheating on me', after allegedly going through her cellphone.

A police source told the Post that the 31-year-old felt in 'fear for her own safety'. 

Nederlander's lawyer Evan Lipton said there was no claim the woman was physically injured and there were 'serious issues undermining the complainant’s credibility'.

The most recent incident has the 46-year-old charged with criminal contempt, a felony that carries up to four years in prison.

There are conflicting reports as to how Nederlander gained entry to Ms Okun's apartment, with some papers saying that the pair had been living together for weeks leading up to the incident and others saying that he got a key from her doorman.

His
father Robert Nederlander is part owner of the Yankees and the family 
own six theatres in new York, including the Nederlander Theatre on West 
41st Street.

According to the Post, this is not the first girlfriend with whom Nederlander has had legal trouble.

When he split from his second wife Lindsey Kupferman, a judge also issued her an order of protection 'based upon a finding of danger to person or property and domestic violence'.

Police had been called to their home on two occasions, but Nederlander was never charged.

He and Ms Kupferman divorced just seven weeks after she gave birth to their daughter.

He also denied any wrongdoing at this time.

Wife number two: Nederlander and his second wife Lindsey Kupferman- who looks rather similar to Ms Okun- have a daughter together named Mira and Nederlander feared the latest incident would result in custody issues
