Do you want a heart attack with that?

Fast food chains are serving up tasty treats loaded with up to 2,000 calories - the daily recommended intake for U.S. adults.

While the ingredients in some of these offerings sound healthy, digging down into the sodium and cholesterol components is enough to send you running for your ab cruncher.

Here are just some of the most popular dishes served up at America's biggest fast food chains which have a worrying calorie count. White Castle tops the list, with its sack of 20 deep-fried chicken rings boasting 1,760 calories - just shy of an adult's recommended daily allowance

Only a handful of chains - McDonald's, 
Panera Bread, Starbucks and Subway - post calorie counts on their
 menus. Soon all chains with more than 20 outlets will have to do it too.

In the meantime, Market Watch has served up 10 of the highest calorie fast foods to help you make informed decisions - and the results are startling.

White Castle tops the list, with its 
sack of 20 deep-fried chicken rings boasting 1,760 calories - just shy 
of an adult's recommended daily allowance.

Dunkin' Donuts comes in at number 8 on the list, with its frozen mocha coffee coolatta with cream at 730 calories

Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, the fatty rings are doughnut-shaped chicken nuggets.

Not far behind on the fat scale is Burger King's Ultimate Breakfast Platter.

The
 scrambled eggs, hash browns, a sausage patty, biscuit and three 
pancakes with syrup amount to 1,450 calories all before work - 1,050 
calories more than the recommended breakfast intake.

McDonald's breakfast offering doesn't fare much better, coming in third with 1,350 calories.

Next up is KFC's 10-piece bag of chicken bites, proving that 'bite-size' doesn't mean healthy.

These little nuggets pack a punch at 1,300 calories per serve.

And the fattiest burger, according to the analysis, is Dave’s Hot ‘N Juicy 3/4 lb triple patty with cheese from Wendy’s, boasting a staggering 1,120 calories.

While Panera Bread has a lot of healthy-sounding items on its menus, the steak and white cheddar French baguette isn't one of them.

Wendy's tower of fat: Dave's Hot 'N Juicy 3/4 lb triple patty with cheese has 1,120 calories

Burger King's Ultimate breakfast platter is loaded with 1,450 calories

Taco Bell's volcanic nachos (left) contain 970 calories; right, Subway markets itself as a healthy alternative but its mega melt has 660 calories 

Fast food chains are serving up fried treats loaded with up to 2,000 calories - the daily recommended intake for U.S. adults.

The
 cheesy sandwich weighs in at 980 calories, although Panera is ahead of 
its competitors by posting the calories on its menus.

Taco Bell's 'volcanic' nachos are a 
mountain of calories, with black beans, chips and fried meat tipping the
 scales at 970 calories.

Dunkin Donuts's meal in a cup, the frozen mocha coffee coolatta with cream, is 730 calories.

Meanwhile Subway, which has always marketed itself as the healthier alternative to fast food, offers a mega melt that has 660 calories.

The egg white omelet on 6 inch flatbread is one of the most unhealthy on Subway's menu.

Coming in at number 10, but still loaded with fat, is one slice of Pizza Hut's 14-inch large meat lover’s pan pizza at 470 calories.

But down the whole pie, and you've just eaten nearly two days worth of food.
