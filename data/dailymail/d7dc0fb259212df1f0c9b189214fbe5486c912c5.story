As these Chelsea Pensioners lined up on their mobility scooters yesterday, it may not have been the most rapid of military manouevres.

However, the old soldiers cut a splendid sight in their scarlet tunics, tricorn hats and gleaming medals.

They formed up yesterday for an inspection at their Founder’s Day Parade at the Royal Hospital, Chelsea.

Wheely proud: Chelsea Pensioners line-up in on their mobility scooters during the annual Founders Day Parade at The Royal Hospital

Attention: Chelsea Pensioners, all British veteren soldiers, stand to attention for inspection as others drive mobility scooters past Sophie, Countess of Wessex, standing at the base of a statue of King Charles II

The former soldiers wear sprigs of oak leaves in reference to King Charles II, who evaded capture by Parliamentary forces after the Battle of Worcester in 1651 by hiding in an oak tree.

He went on to found the hospital in 1682 to care for those unfit for further duty due to old age or injury.

The Royal Hospital, which since 1913 has also hosted the annual Chelsea Flower Show, was designed by Sir Christopher Wrenn.

King Charles II, who died in 1685, three years after commissioning it, witnessed rapid-paced construction and lived to see the completion main hall and chapel.

The first patients included those injured at the Battle of Sedgemoor, a failed uprising against Charles’ sucessor, James II.

By 1686, Wren had expanded his original design to add two additional quadrangles to the east and west of the central court.

History: The Royal Hospital remained responsible for distributing army pensions until 1955, following which the phrase out-pensioner became less common, and Chelsea pensioner was used largely to refer to in-pensioners

Origins: The Royal Hospital, which since 1913 has also hosted the annual Chelsea Flower Show, was designed by Sir Christopher Wrenn

And in 1692, work was completed and the first in-pensioners were admitted in February of that year.

Eligible ex-soldiers who could not be housed in the Hospital were termed out-pensioners, receiving their pension from the Royal Hospital but living outside it.

In-pensioners, by contrast, surrender their army pension and live within the Royal Hospital.

In 1703, there were only 51 out-pensioners. By 1815 this figure had risen to 36,757.

The Royal Hospital remained responsible for distributing army pensions until 1955, following which the phrase ‘out-pensioner’ became less common, and ‘Chelsea pensioner’ was used largely to refer to ‘in-pensioners’.
