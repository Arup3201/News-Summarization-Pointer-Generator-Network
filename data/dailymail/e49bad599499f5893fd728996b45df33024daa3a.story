A man has drowned after jumping off an Ibiza party boat.

The Polish holidaymaker leaped off the 60ft catamaran, named locally as Passion Cat, at 7pm last night after dropping something in the sea.

The tragedy came hours after a meeting between police and local councillors to discuss the regulation of so-called party boats.

Tragic: A British man has drowned after jumping into the Ibiza sea from a party catamaran to retrieve something

Police divers recovered his body three and a half hours later after a failed attempt by coastguards to locate him.

A post mortem was due to take place later today.

The incident happened near Cala Tarida, a
 popular beach resort on the west of the island close to Kate 
Middleton's uncle's villa Maison de Bang Bang.

The boat, Passion Cat, is capable of holding up to 80 guests which can be chartered for day events over the internet.

The vessel is rented out for hen and stag parties with a DJ and bar thrown in.

It has also been used for boat parties leaving the resort of San Antonio early in the morning after the pubs and nightclubs shut.

Reports said there were several dozen tourists on board the catamaran when the incident happened.

Local government chief Vicent Serra said: 'The circumstances in which this man died are still unclear.

'We are awaiting the results of an investigation by the Guardia Civil.'

Over the past few years the boat party market in Ibiza has grown considerably.

Most of the boats leaving San Antonio ow sail around sunset and some include free bars.

Ibiza Rocks offers a twice-weekly pre-gig party with resident DJs.

BBC Radio 1's Scott Mills is due to DJ on board Pukka Up, which bills itself as Ibiza's biggest and most popular boat party, on August 2.

There have been several tragedies involving party boats in Spain.

In July 2006 Irishman Brazil Bourke died after jumping from the top deck of a boat off Ibiza during a drunken cruise with a pal.

The captain was cleared of his death after being accused of abandoning the 21-year student in the sea and tried for his manslaughter.
