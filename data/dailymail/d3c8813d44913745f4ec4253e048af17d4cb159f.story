Rival Star Wars and Doctor Who fans had to be separated by 'the force' after police were called to a fight at a sci-fi convention between the two squabbling groups.

The family event, hosted at the University of East Anglia, threatened to head towards the dark side after the dispute erupted between members of Norwich Sci-Fi Club and Norwich Star Wars Club.

More than a dozen fans from both groups - including several in fancy dress - were involved in a bitter exchange outside the venue, sparked by the arrival of Jim Poole, treasurer of the Norwich Sci-Fi Club.

After approaching Doctor Who actor Graham Cole for an autograph, he was asked to leave prompting a stand-off which was only resolved by the intervention of police and university security guards.

Officers were called to allegations of an assault but after reviewing CCTV decided no further action was necessary and warned the groups to stay apart.

A police spokesman added: 'After lengthy
 investigation, talking to witnesses and reviewing good CCTV footage, it
 was confirmed that there was no assault.

'The two rival groups were spoken to and advised to keep out of the way of each other.'

The row, which happened on Sunday at 
around 2.30pm, dates back to a long-running dispute between Norwich Star
 Wars Club and Norwich Sci-Fi Club and the annual events they organise.

The animosity had escalated in recent weeks with allegations of offensive posts on social networking sites.

Star
 Wars organiser Richard Walker, 63, said: 'It has been a long running 
saga. We aren’t a club to make waves and we have been going for 14 years
 without any problems until the Norwich Sci-Fi Club started making these
 demands.

'Mr Poole turned up with his three friends and were admitted because the person on the door did not recognise them.'

Star Wars Club secretary Dominic 
Warner added: 'We are a Star Wars club and they are mostly Doctor Who. 
We have our events and they have theirs. All this is very childish.

'They
 are knocking our reputation and saying we are trading off them, but we 
have been going for 14 years and we don’t need to trade off anyone. It 
should be live and let live.'

Feud: Richard Walker of the Norwich Star Wars Club said there had been a long-running dispute with the Dr Who group led by Jim Poole

Mr
 Poole said he had attended the event 'in good faith' to collect 
autographs from two actors for a Doctor Who signature diary to be 
auctioned for charity.

Norwich Sci-Fi Club is staging its own convention on September 8 this year.

Mr
 Poole, 44, of Lowestoft, Suffolk, said: 'There has been a long-standing
 feud between the two clubs because Mr Walker simply will not work with 
us. We got miffed when they decided to rename their event and call it a 
convention.

'It caused 
total confusion because people who had booked with us for our convention
 in September were thinking that the Norwich Star Wars Club was our one 
which had been moved to May.

'We
 have always wanted to see things smoothed over. We have held out the 
hand of friendship for a long time, but it has always been knocked 
back.'

The two groups have said they are having discussions about having a meeting to settle their differences amicably.
