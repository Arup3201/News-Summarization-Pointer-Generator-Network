It may look like it has run the gautlet with every Bond villain but this run-down Aston Martin would be worth a whopping £200,000 if restored to its former glory.

The 1966 DB6 Vantage, that was last bought for just £4,000 in the 1970s, has spent the last 30 years languishing under a thick layer of dust in a barn.

Despite being caked in mud and having an exhausted appearance, the British-built classic motor is tipped to sell for £30,000.

Run-down: This Aston Martin is expected to fetch up to £30,000 at auction

'Tired interior': A box of old motoring bits sits in the driver's footwell while the driver's seat is occupied by a rusty spare wheel

Rusty: The four-litre, 325bhp six cylinder engine was rebuilt, fully lubricated and stored in a container with 86,000 miles on the clock, but looks like it could still do with a bit of work

Experts say it will need a 'full monty' restoration, which could cost up to six figures.

The late owner of the Aston Martin, the car favoured by James Bond, drove it througout the 1970s but locked it away in a barn in 1983 - and it has sat there ever since.

One of the car's two spotlights is missing, its spoked wheels are coated in rust and it has no rear bumper.

Any buyer will have to fight their way through cobwebs to get to the interior.

Dusty: Despite needing thousands of pounds to be spent on it, the classic car could be worth a fortune if returned to pristine condition

Caked in mud: The windows are so dirty it is impossible to see through them

Classic car: The 1966 DB6 Vantage was last bought for just £4,000 in the 1970s

History: The car's late owner drove it througout the 1970s but locked it away in a barn in 1983

The car is in such a bad state that it is 'sold as seen' - with no paperwork to back up its history.

Launched in 1965, the DB6 superceded the famous DB5 model and enjoyed a production run of six years, the longest of any Aston Martin model.

As with previous Aston Martin cars a high-powered Vantage was made, capable of 0-60 in eight seconds and boasting a top speed of 150mph.

The Vantage model featured triple Weber carburetors and a high-compression cylinder head that produced 325 bhp.

Despite needing thousands of pounds spent on it, the classic car could be worth a fortune if returned to pristine condition.

Tim Schofield, director of Bonhams motor car department, said: 'This is a beautiful car but I imagine nearly everything needs doing to it.

'It is complete but it is going to require a restoration in the full sense of the word. This one needs the full monty.

'If you were to get it restored to 
its former glory by the best there is you would be lucky to come away 
with a bill that is less than £200,000. However it would then be worth 
that or more.

'This is a rare opportunity to own a classic Aston Martin and embark on a journey bringing it back to life.

Mileage: The engine is believed to have done about 86,000 miles

Work needed: One of the car's two spotlights is missing, its spoked wheels are coated in rust and it has no rear bumper

Costly: Despite being caked in mud and having an exhausted appearance, the British-built classic motor is tipped to sell for £30,000

'The chance to get hold of a project Aston Martin is one people will fight keenly over.'

An identical 1967 model in mint condition is being auctioned in the same sale by Bonhams - and is expected to fetch £150,000.

The sale will be held at Aston Martin Works in Buckinghamshire on May 18.
