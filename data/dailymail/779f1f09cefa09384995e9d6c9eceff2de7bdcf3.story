Shetland schoolgirl Erraid Davies won a bronze medal in the women's 100m breaststroke SB9 final at Glasgow 2014 after the 13-year-old set a new personal best for the second time in a day.

Scotland's youngest-ever Comonwealth Games competitor had come second in the heat on Sunday morning and fought her way into the medal positions in the last quarter of the final.

Roared on by the Tollcross crowd, she finished just behind Australian silver medallist Madeleine Scott in one minute and 21.38 seconds, with New Zealand's Sophie Pascoe taking gold.

Davies later took a standing ovation in her stride following the medal ceremony but she had earlier shunned the limelight among her school friends.

'They didn't know before I came here, I didn't really know how to tell them,' she said.

Davies had finished second in the morning heat, which featured the same seven competitors as the final, and she admitted she had trouble keeping calm during the afternoon, although she did manage a sleep.

'I knew there was only seven of us in our event, so there was a chance,' she said. 'I started getting really excited this morning.

'I am really happy to have another PB. I got a medal and I am so happy. I am feeling really, really happy.'

When asked what she felt she could achieve in her sport, she said: 'I don't know. I am just going to keep on swimming and see where it gets me.'
