A serial drink-driver has been sentenced to life in prison after he was pulled over for the eighth time by police.

Cornelio Garcia-Mata, 45, was stopped by police on February 26 this year after his truck was seen swerving all over the interstate in New Braunfels, Texas.

He was found to have a blood alcohol level six times the legal limit when police caught him shortly before 6pm - despite denying to officers that he had anything to drink.

'More dangerous than a murderer': Cornelio Garcia-Mata, 45, has been sentenced to life in a Texas prison after his eighth DWI conviction

He was held at Comal County Jail until his trial last week where he was found guilty of a first-degree felony and sentenced to 25 years to life.

The jury took only 20 minutes to convict Garcia-Mata after finding that his vehicle was a deadly weapon, according to CBS. As far authorities know, he has never killed anyone.

The arrest added to his already weighty record of three misdemeanor DWI offenses and four felonies for the same crime. His first conviction was in 1990.

He was charged with his second DWI while on probation for his first offense. In 2008, he served under two years of a six-year sentence.

Jennifer Tharp, from the District Attorney's office, told WOAl: 'This individual poses more of a danger to society than some of our murderers do.'

He will be transferred to the state prison and is not eligible for parole until he is 75 years old.
