A former Qantas customer service worker has claimed the company ordered her to remove her crucifix necklace despite her Muslim colleagues being allowed to wear headscarfs.

Georgina Sarikoudis, a Melbourne mother-of-two, said she was told to 'cut off' her prayer knot bracelets and remove her crucifix while working for the company in late 2013 and early 2014.

Ms Sarikoudis, who attends a Greek Orthodox Church in the city's south-east, made the allegations about her treatment in a complaint to the Victorian Civil and Administration Tribunal (VCAT).

The crucifix in question: Ms Sarikoudis alleged she was told to remove her crucifix

'The bullying was getting so intense and out of control, I thought: "I've got to stop this. I'm going to VCAT"',' Ms Sarikoudis told Daily Mail Australia.  

She said the alleged dramas occurred after Qantas introduced a new uniform in December. 

The rules surrounding religious jewellery did not change, however the airline said employees were reminded of uniform rules and guidelines at the time.  

Ms Sarikoudis, who worked for the airline company for 19 years, was outraged that her Islamic colleagues were allowed to wear their headscarfs while she was allegedly unable to wear her crucifix. 

'This is discrimination, it's just not acceptable,' Ms Sarikoudis said. 'How can you have a policy for one religion and not another in a country like Australia.' 

A Qantas spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia employees were allowed to wear religious jewellery, adding that the company provided employees with many options so they can continue to wear it. 

'Our uniform standards don’t prohibit employees from wearing religious jewellery,' the spokeswoman said. 

'Many of our employees wear such jewellery every day, it’s simply worn under their uniform.' 

'We give our employees plenty of options so they can continue to wear religious jewellery that is in accordance with the requirement of their faith.' 

Controversy: Ms Sarikoudis worked for Qantas for 19 years before she took a voluntary redundancy in May

Qantas workers can wear headscarfs for religious, cultural or medical purposes only if they are French navy or black in colour. 

The Qantas spokeswoman said all employees were required to follow uniform codes and guidelines, as is with most airlines.

According to the Herald Sun, Ms Sarikoudis is seeking an apology and a change in uniform policy from her former employer in her VCAT claim.

VCAT is slated to hold a hearing into the matter in February next year.
