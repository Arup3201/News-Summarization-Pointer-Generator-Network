The bouffant pink hair, the pouty lips and dazzling colour scheme means that this flamboyant little fish bears an uncanny likeness to American rapper Nicki Minaj.

Nicknamed 'Fishi Minaj', the Flowerhorn fish was snapped by Ittichai Chammavanijakul, 40, who was on holiday in Bangkok, Thailand.

Dazzling: With it's pink 'hair' and bright colours, this tropical fish photographed in Thailand bears a resemblance to eccentric U.S. pop star Nicki Minaj

Ittichai, from Chicago, said: 'I took the picture without really knowing who Nicki Minaj was - but after I found out I was going through my files one evening and it hit me.'

'I started laughing to myself when I noticed the likeness of the hair and it looks like the fish is almost pouting too.

'From pictures I have seen I noticed she
likes to wear a lot of pink and purple outfits as well which made it 
even funnier to see.

Eye-catching: Like her aquatic counterpart Nicki Minaj likes to be centre of attention with her daring hair and colourful pouts

'The fish are hugely popular across Asia as the fish look so unique - but this is definitely one of a kind now it looks like a pop star.'

Flowerhorn cichlids are man-made hybrids which do not exist in nature.

They were first developed in Thailand, Malaysia and Taiwan and are named after their distinct head shape.

Nicki Minaj is currenty a judge on American Idol, but she threatened to storm off the set last week.

Water baby: Nicki Minaj herself is also a fan of the water, she tweeted this picture of herself from her new music video 'High School'

She was furious when her favourite contestant Curtis Finch Jr - who at one point was being tipped as a possible winner - had landed in the bottom two of the Top 10.

Minaj gave up her Saturday night to visit fellow rapper Lil Wayne at Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles.

He reportedly fell ill after suffering multiple seizures while shooting Minaj's new video, High School on Tuesday.
