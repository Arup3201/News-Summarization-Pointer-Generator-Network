A seriously-ill woman recovering from chemotherapy was beaten about the head with a stiletto heel by a drunk woman who said 'So you're the c*** with cancer'.

Pub landlady Lisa Percy, 52, who had lost her hair following treatment for breast cancer, was left bleeding from a head wound as she tried to eject care worker Natalie Hull, 19, over a drunken scuffle at her bar.

As Mrs Percy attempted to restore order, Hull hit another woman over the head with a beer bottle before attacking the landlady with a friend's high-heeled shoe, which left her requiring hospital treatment.

The attack occurred after Mrs Percy, who runs the Welcome Tavern in Walton-le-Dale, near Preston, Lancashire, had just undergone her first mastectomy as part of her cancer treatment.

Mrs Percy has spoken of the ordeal after Hull, now 20, was sentenced to 140 hours unpaid work with an 18 month community order after she pleaded guilty to assault.

Mrs Percy said: 'I can’t think why Natalie did this or how she even knew I had cancer before she saw me. In a way I feel sorry for her because she is only 20 and now she has that terrible conviction on her record.

'She was drunk and stupid and its very sad she should have behaved like this. Everyone in the pub was mortified after the attack and I don’t see why anyone would do that to anyone - let alone someone who clearly had cancer.

'What’s worse was that her mother who is lovely was going round the village asking if my attacker had been caught, before she found out it was Natalie.'

The incident began in January this year when Mrs Percy, who was diagnosed with her illness the previous September, was resting upstairs in her living quarters after the latest round of her treatment.

She said: 'I could hear some silly girl screaming outside and a barman came up and said "I think you better come down". He couldn’t control it.

'I found out the noise was coming from a girl around the front who said she had been attacked. I found out who the girls were who attacked this person and threw them out.

'There was lads with them and it erupted in a massive brawl. I’ve never had anything like that since and it had only happened once before. It’s usually a quiet pub.

Mrs Percy said she managed to grab the stiletto after being hit with it and pushed Hull away

'I went outside to try and stop them. My head was really bad after all the chemo and the steroids I was on for it. My youngest son came out and I told him to phone the police.

'About 20 lads were kicking hell out of each other and all I could hear was girls screaming like banshees. We had eldely customers inside and they were scared because of the fight and these girls shouting and wanting to fight.

'Ten years ago I would probably would have taken them on but I was so ill. This girl asked me "who the f*** I was" and I said it’s my pub.

'Then she said "so you’re the c*** with cancer then?" Then she grabbed me. I was absolutely speechless.'

Mrs Percy told Hull to leave and one of the regulars Lauren Joyner, 21, tried to intervene - but was spat at in the fact.

Mrs Percy said: 'Natalie picked up a Budweiser bottle and smashed it over Lauren’s head and you could see the blood pumping out. Then one of Natalie’s friends had fallen over and her shoe had fallen off so she picked it up and hit me on the head with it.

'I managed to grab it out of her hand and pushed her away but there was a lot of blood - presumably it looked worse because I was bald from the chemo. I actually wasn’t in pain at the time - the pain came about three days later.

'And of course the injury from the heel hitting my head was visible because I was bald. I just wanted to go back upstairs.'

Hull ran off after police arived but was arrested later. She was also ordered by Leyland magistrates to pay Mrs Percy and Lauren £300 each as well as costs of £210 at a hearing on August 22.

Mrs Percy added: 'In the weeks before the attack I had lost all my hair. My nails fell out, my toenails fell off, my eyelashes fell out.

'I was sick, I was tired and I couldn’t work. I’m still not working properly. I feel quite well now, but still very tired I need to have a preventative mastectomy in three weeks time.

'I might be like this for two years because it was the most aggressive chemo you can have. What concerned me the most is people locally told us she was a care worker - what kind of person would do that to someone knowing they were poorly with cancer?'

Hull was unavailable for comment.
