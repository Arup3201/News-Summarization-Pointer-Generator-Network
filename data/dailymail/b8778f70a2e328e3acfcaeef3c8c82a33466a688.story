American Idol runner-up Clay Aiken has won what had been a hotly contested Democratic primary for a North Carolina congressional seat after his opponent suddenly died on Monday.

The final, unofficial vote count that was posted Tuesday and it ruled that Aiken was the winner.

The county-by-county tally of the 2nd Congressional District race posted by the state Tuesday confirmed Aiken got more than 40 per cent of the vote needed to win the three-candidate race.

Aiken will face Republican incumbent Renee Ellmers in November in the GOP-leaning district where Mitt Romney won nearly six in 10 votes in 2012.

Winner of the first round: The vote in the Democratic primary was too close to call at first but apparently Clay Aiken was the final winner and will now face the Republican incumbent Renee Ellmers

Ellmers won by 56 per cent that year and is not looking for a third term.

On Monday, second-place finisher Keith Crisco, 71, died after falling at his home.

Hours earlier, campaign manager Christine Botta said they had counted the absentee votes in two key counties, forcing Crisco to acknowledge defeat. He had decided to concede his loss to Aiken on Tuesday, she said.

'Keith and I talked in detail about the fact that the votes weren't there,' Botta said.

Aiken and Crisco each picked up a handful of votes after the last of the absentee ballots returned by a Monday deadline were counted, according to results on the State Board of Elections website.

The results will become official after
 review by the state elections board. That meeting isn't yet set, 
Elections board spokesman Joshua Lawson said, but is tentatively 
scheduled for May 22.

Crisco slipped and fell while stepping through the front door of his home in Asheboro, about 65 miles west of Raleigh.

Crisco,
 71, made a name for himself in the business world before served as 
secretary of commerce for North Carolina from 2009 to 2013.

Rest in peace: Congressional candidate Keith Crisco died at his home in Asheboro, N.C. on Monday, putting singer Clay Aiken in the November congressional race against Renee Ellmers

Crisco was a former North Carolina secretary of commerce known for recruiting businesses to the Tarheel State from other U.S. regions

In that role he was one of the state's most prolific recruiters of businesses from other states, serving in the administration of then-Governor Bev Perdue.

Aiken, 35, issued a statement shortly after the news was confirmed by Crisco's textile company, Asheboro Elastics.

'I
 am stunned and deeply saddened by Keith Crisco's death,' the 
entertained said. 'Keith came from humble beginnings. No matter how high
 he rose – to Harvard, to the White House and to the Governor's Cabinet
 – he never forgot where he came from.'

'He
 was a gentleman, a good and honorable man and an extraordinary public 
servant. I was honored to know him. I am suspending all campaign 
activities as we pray for his family and friends.'
