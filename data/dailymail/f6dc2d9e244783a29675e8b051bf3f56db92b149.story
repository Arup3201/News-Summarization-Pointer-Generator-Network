Polling staff have been warned to expect ‘confrontational behaviour’ at the end of one of the most bitterly fought political campaigns in Scottish history.

Almost 3.5 million people will attend polling stations between 7am and 10pm on Thursday – and with tensions running high, staff have been briefed to prepare for ‘serious disturbances’.

The record turnout is expected to lead to massive queues and concerns have been raised that 'militant voters’ – many of whom have never participated in an election – will create a ‘protest’ atmosphere.

Police Scotland have cancelled all leave as the force prepares a massive security operation at polling stations across the country

Electoral staff have been warned to expect 'serious disturbances' at polling stations as the campaign between Yes and No supporters gets increasingly bitter

All police leave has been cancelled as a massive security operation is mounted at each of the country’s 2,608 polling places.

In anticipation of possible disorder sparked by the referendum result, officers have also been banned from taking ‘rest days’ on Friday.

In recent weeks the debate has reached boiling point, with abuse, vandalism and threats of violence being doled out by both sides.

 East Renfrewshire Labour MP Jim Murphy suspended his tour of the country at the end of last month after what he described as ‘co-ordinated abuse’ from Yes campaigners, which included being pelted with eggs in Kirkcaldy, Fife.

The Electoral Management Board for Scotland has issued all polling staff with a 58-page referendum handbook.

This states: ‘It is possible station staff will encounter difficult situations or be faced with confrontational behaviour.’

It adds: ‘It is essential that polling stations are run in a calm, orderly manner.’

Almost 3.5 million voters are expected to attend polling stations, a record turnout in Scottish history. Postal votes are already being counted at stations like this in Edinburgh

Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said: ‘Our priority is to ensure public safety and security’

 Staff are warned ‘not to become engaged in an argument’ and presiding officers are told they must contact the police any major problems arise.

The presiding officer is empowered to order a person’s removal from the polling station but, even in the most extreme cases, they are meant to offer the person a chance to cast their vote first.

Advice is also offered to staff about what to do in the event of a bomb scare.

They are told that, if forced to leave the premises, they must establish a ‘temporary polling station’ at a ‘safe distance’.

Staff are also advised to be patient with young, first-time voters.

The handbook states: ‘The referendum is the first national electoral event at which 16 and 17-year-olds are able to vote.

‘As result, you may have a higher than usual number of voters who need some additional assistance from you to understand the process.’

A senior police source disclosed last night that teams of officers had been working behind the scenes to gather intelligence on possible voting day disruptions.

The source, who asked not to be named, said: ‘This vote will bring out a great number of people who have never voted before and who don’t know the protocols of voting stations and behaviour in or near places where the public vote.

‘Many of them will be from the more militant social backgrounds who tend to turn up at protests and football casual type incidents.

‘With that as a backdrop, police have been infiltrating and gathering intelligence to counter any organised disruption.

‘With recent incidents showing loud, animated opposition, I imagine there could be more trouble than usual.’

Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said: ‘The referendum is a significant event which is expected to attract a higher than normal turnout.

‘Policing arrangements are well in hand and will be appropriate and proportionate.

‘Our priority is to ensure public safety and security.’

Around 97 per cent of the country’s 4.42 million eligible voters have registered to vote, and at least 3.5 million are expected to attend polling stations.

By contrast, in the 2011 Scottish parliament elections which bought the SNP to power, turnout was only 50.6 per cent.

Chief counting officer Mary Pitcaithly has urged voters to help prevent overcrowding at polling stations by going to vote during working hours if possible.

She said: ‘Polling places are busiest during the early morning and in the evening as people vote on their way to and from work.’

Polls must close at 10pm, but anyone who begins queuing before then must be allowed to cast their vote.

The official handbook states: ‘If the polling station is too small to accommodate all the voters in the queue, a member of the team should mark the end of the queue by positioning themselves there.’
