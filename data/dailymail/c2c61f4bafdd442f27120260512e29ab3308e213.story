Sad record: Pensioner Francis Cook has become Britain's oldest drug dealer at the age of 83

An 83-year-old man has become Britain's oldest convicted drug dealer after he was caught growing nearly 200 cannabis plants.

Francis Cook was jailed for two-and-a-half years after turning to dealing to supplement his pension.

His operation was foiled when police raided his bungalow and found books on how to grow the class B drug. 

Officers seized £1,391 in cash, scales containing traces of cocaine and invoices for equipment from his home.

The grey-haired pensioner - nicknamed Snowy - also had keys to an industrial unit in his Ford Escort van.

Police searched the unit, in Fareham, Hants, and found 182 skunk plants with a street value of £70,000.

Cook’s fingerprints were found on a lightbulb and on one of three separate growing areas.

Portsmouth Crown Court heard Cook had been released from prison on licence for others drugs offences.

But he returned to crime when he wrongly thought he owed £38,000 for a previous confiscation order made by the courts.

In mitigation, it was claimed he was paid just £300 for acting as a caretaker and looking after the crop.

But Judge Ian Pearson ruled that Cook played a significant role in the operation.

Cook, from Fareham, pleaded guilty to one count of producing a class B drug between April and August last year.

Judge Pearson said: 'I take account of your age - you are nearly 84 - you must be the country’s oldest drug dealer and you are in ill health.

'Having said that, you have numerous previous convictions for drug offences with numerous custodial  sentences that arose from those offences.

'It’s a very sad day when I have to sentence an 83-year-old, nearly 84-year-old, man for offences like these.'

An order was made for the drugs to be forfeited and destroyed.

As he begins his sentence, neighbours in Meadowbank Road described their shock that softly-spoken Cook could have concealed such a crime.

One resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'He seemed like a very respectable, elderly gentleman and I never saw anything to suggest he was up to anything dodgy.

'This is a quiet residential street packed with children and elderly people. I didn’t expect a dealer to be living in that house.'
