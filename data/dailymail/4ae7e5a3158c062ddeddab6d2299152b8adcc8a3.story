Festival season is upon us and that can only mean one thing for fashion: fringing, florals and loose fits.

And showing that summer style comes in all shapes and sizes Simply Be have shot their festival fashion campaign on real women: five of the hottest plus size bloggers.

Ranging from sizes 12-22, Marie from MiggMag, Allison from 
Curvy Girl Chic, Callie of From the Corners of the Curve, Lois from 
BunniPunch and Steph from Nerd About Town rock the brand's latest kimonos, leather jackets and shorts styles.

L-R Marie Southard-Ospina from MiggMag, 23, Allison Teng from Curvy Girl Chic, 26, Callie Thorpe of From the Corners of the Curve, 25, Lois Spencer-Tracey from BunniPunch, 31, Steph Yeboah from Nerd About Town, 25

Lois from 
BunniPunch told MailOnline: 'Simply be have some great festival 
favourites this season, like the denim lace trim shorts and Aztec print 
tops!

'I love that their sizing starts at size 12, means I can enjoy more of their pieces this summer!'

Callie from From The Corners Of The Curve says: 'The 
aim for my blog has always been to share my love of fashion and 
encourage body confidence among all women. I love Simply Be as their 
clothes enable a size 32 woman to wear the same fashionable looks as her
 size 12 friend.'

The curvy fashion bloggers took the opportunity to model 
Simply Be's brand new festival collection in a Secret Garden Party 
themed photo shoot in London, encouraging every woman's right to fashionable clothes - regardless of size.

Simply Be recently added a size 12 to their 14-32 size range - in a move to be more inclusive still.

They work very closely with the blogging community and are keen to give their customers what they want - to see the fashion on a diverse range of sizes.

A Simply Be spokesperson says: 'Simply 
being yourself is at the heart of our brand, so it's wonderful to work 
with these amazing women who not only have incredible style, but also 
the self-confidence that has inspired so many of their readers to 
realise they can wear what they want without size limitation, and that 
they need never compromise on their personal style.'

The innovative label create clothing in sizes 
12-32, but cleverly tailor each piece of clothing to fit each size 
correctly.

Other retailers usually cut from a size 10 or 12 and scale up
 to larger sizes.

The
 Simply Be buying team predict that the print kaftan maxi dress, 
£36 will be a big seller, due to its attractive price tag, vibrancy and 
exceptional fit.

Also featuring in the range is a statement leather effect fringe biker jacket, £65, a perfect all season cover up, and a floral Mary Katrantzou inspired knee length dress.

From now on the brand promise a blogger photo shoot for each season, showcasing the most on trend pieces set to inspire plus-size fashionistas.
