Arsene Wenger's Arsenal side cruised past West Ham to keep in touching distance of Manchester City in second place in the Premier League.

Olivier Giroud fired in the opener on the stroke of half-time before Aaron Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini added second-half goals to secure the vital three points.

West Ham have only won one games now in 12 league matches as Arsenal continue to strengthen a top four finish.

Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud leaps into the air in celebration as he scored the opener at the Emirates

ARSENAL (4-3-3)

David Ospina 6.5 

Sound display from the goalkeeper but jury remains undecided over whether he can be Arsenal's long-term No. 1.

Calum Chambers 7 

A couple of dozy moments at the back but was excellent going forward.

Per Mertesacker 6.5 

On easy street for majority of the encounter, but, for the most part, didn't let his concentration levels slip.

Gunners midfielder Aaron Ramsey roars in celebration as he doubled Arsenal's lead in the second-half

Laurent Koscielny 6.5 

Dealt well with the movement and pace of Hammers' lone frontman Sakho.

Nacho Monreal 7

Another solid display from the left-back. Real battle with Kieran Gibbs to be club's first-choice left-back.

Aaron Ramsey 7 

A mature display from the Welshman on his return to the starting XI. Will be vital in the run-in.

Francis Coquelin 7 

Another industrious and terrier-like performance from the Frenchman. A vital cog for Wenger now. 

Arsenal forward Theo Walcott, challenged by James Collins at the Emirates, failed to take his chances

Theo Walcott 6

Handed a rare start but failed to grasp the opportunity after missing three guild-edged chances. 6

Mesut Ozil 7

Saw plenty of the ball, particularly in the first-half. Showed flashes of quality without being at his very best.

Alexis Sanchez 6

Nowhere near the dynamite form from earlier this season. Are the rigours of English football catching up with him?

Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil looks on in frustration as a chance goes begging at the Emirates Stadium

Olivier Giroud 8.5

Scored his seventh goal in 10 games and made another. Excellent performance. Must now do it in the Champions League against Monaco? 

Subs

Danny Welbeck 6.5

Injected urgency and pace in to the Arsenal attack.

Santi Cazorla 6.5

Rested ahead of the trip to Monaco but came on to see his team home. 

Mathieu Flamini 6.5 

Back after injury to help see Arsenal over the line and score a rare goal.

WEST HAM (4-4-2)

Adrian 8

Made a string of important saves to keep West Ham in the game. Impressive performance. 

Joey O'Brien 6.5

A rare start for the defender but did a sufficient enough job against the pace of interchanging Walcott and Sanchez.

James Collins 6.5

The club's only fit centre-back organised his back-four well against a barrage of Arsenal pressure in the first half.

Hammers keeper Adrian threatened to spoil Arsenal's afternoon with a succession of fine first half saves

Cheikhou Kouyate 6.5 

Utilised as a makeshift centre-back and didn't look out of place despite the result.

Aaron Cresswell 7 

Did an admiral job in keeping Sanchez and Walcott quiet. Surely on England manager Roy Hodgson's radar.

Stewart Downing 6 

Didn't have the influence West Ham have come to expect this season, but still put a shift in. 

Mark Noble 6 

Kept things ticking over in midfield without being spectacular. Subbed. 

Former Arsenal midfielder Alex Song (left) tracks Alexis Sanchez on his return to the Emirates 

Alex Song 6.5 

Was desperate to do well on his return to the Emirates Stadium. Can be satisfied with his display if not the result.

Kevin Nolan 6 

Looked to be struggling with an injury in the first half but recovered to play a role in West Ham's early second half rally.

Matt Jarvis 6.5

His energy caused Arsenal some problems before he was substituted in the second half. 

West Ham forward Diafra Sakho (centre) tries to evade Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny 

Diafra Sakho 6.5

Cut an isolated figure at times, but still caused the Gunners rearguard problems with his pace. 

Subs

Morgan Amalfitano 6 

Came on to help West Ham find an opening. Had little impact. 6

Nene 6 

Had little time to make an impact.
