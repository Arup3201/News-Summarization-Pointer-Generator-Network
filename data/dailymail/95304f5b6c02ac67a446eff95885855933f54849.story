Real Madrid centre back Raphael Varane has revealed he rejected a move to Manchester United in 2011 as the Premier League outfit had just signed Phil Jones.

Former Red Devils manager Sir Alex Ferguson was interested in bringing Varane to Old Trafford after the Frenchman impressed during his debut season at Lens.

However Ferguson missed out on signing the 21-year-old as Varane decided to reject his offer after Jones joined the club on a five-year deal.

2014-15: Eight appearances, 0 goals, two clean sheets

2013-14: 22 appearances, 0 goals, eight clean sheets

2012-13: 28 appearances, 2 goals, seven clean sheets

2011-12: 13 appearances, one goal, five clean sheets

Total: 71 appearances, three goals, 22 clean sheets

14 France caps, 0 goals

When asked about his decision to move to the Spanish capital, Varane told L'Equipe: 'Manchester United? They had just signed Phil Jones in my position.

'PSG? The project there wasn't clear. The Qataris had only just arrived and it was all very vague.

'My first reaction when Real wanted to sign me was not, "Of course I will go". I only made my decision when I knew that the coach wanted me to play in the first team.'

Former Real Madrid manager Jose Mourinho revealed on Monday that Varane had 'one foot at Manchester United' before Zinedine Zidane convinced him to sign the promising defender.
