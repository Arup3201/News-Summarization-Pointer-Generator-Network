A haul of 8.5 million cigarettes is to be incinerated to provide power for the National Grid.

They were found in a shipping container from Malaysia – which was supposed to contain fabric –  at the Port of Felixstowe in Suffolk by Border Force officers.

It is believed the cigarettes would have been sold illegally at markets, pubs and car boot sales, depriving the UK Treasury of about £2.5 million in tax.

Charlotte Mann, acting deputy director for Border Force, said: ‘We have stopped a major smuggling attempt and starved those responsible of the proceeds of their criminality.’

It is the latest in a number of batches to be seized this year.

In May, a haul of 16.5 million cigarettes smuggled into the UK by a Manchester couple was seized and burned for energy.

It came after a ship of lost cargo including millions of cigarettes washed up in Devon - before being packed off to the National Grid.

Hurricane-force winds battered the Svendborg Maersk as it sailed around the Atlantic coast of Europe on February 14.

The Danish ship lost cargo after it was hit with 30ft waves and 60 knot winds off the coast of Northern France.

At least £3million worth of cigarettes have been found washed-up in Devon and Dorset, including Marlboro Reds and Marlboro menthols - but HMRC say all cigarettes found will be burned to produce electricity.
