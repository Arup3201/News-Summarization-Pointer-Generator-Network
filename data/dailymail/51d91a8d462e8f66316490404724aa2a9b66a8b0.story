A suicidal man having financial problems killed his wife, three children and then himself over the weekend, police said on Monday.

Detectives said Joel Smith, 33, shot his family inside their apartment about 11.30pm on Saturday with a 12-gauge shotgun.

Twelve-year-old Jason Montez and seven-year-old Noah were shot to death in their separate bedrooms. Thirty-five-year-old Heather Smith and four-year-old Lily Smith were shot in the parents' bed.

Joel Smith's body was found on the floor nearby, the gun by his side. The children were shot dead while they slept, according to police.

Jason was Joel Smith's stepson and the other two are his biological children with Mrs Smith.

Police said no suicide note was found, but investigators said the wife had told a family friend the night of the shooting that Joel Smith recently had threatened suicide.

According to the Boston Herald, police said Smith put a gun to his head days before killing his family. Neither the 33-year-old or his wife sought help but she told a friend what he had done.

Saco police Sgt. Chris Harriman also told the paper that the family spent time with friends at a barbecue earlier on Saturday.

The friend later contacted an apartment complex worker to express concerns about the family's well-being, leading to the grisly discovery, investigators said.

The family had domestic issues and financial problems, said Sgt. Christopher Harriman, a state police detective.

The family had moved from Arizona two years ago because of the sour economy, said Joel Smith's mother, Jerys Caruthers-Thorpe, of Scottsdale, Arizona.

Heather Smith, a medical assistant, also was getting help for substance abuse, Ms Caruthers-Thorpe said.

'I know something had to have snapped because Joel never would have done that in his right mind,' she said.

The Portland Press Herald reported that neighbors heard a sound 'like firecrackers' on Saturday night while one resident said he saw Joel Smith leaving the apartment on Sunday morning before returning.

Neighbors described the father as well known in the apartment complex along the Saco River because he worked for a company that provided maintenance services. They said he was friendly and outgoing.

Smith, who was a carpenter and 
builder, decided to follow his father to Maine in hopes of escaping the 
tough economy out West, Caruthers-Thorpe said.

Only
 recently, she said, her son had realized his wife was suffering from 
addiction, and they'd talked about moving back to Phoenix.

'They were having problems, serious problems,' she said. 'They were in the process of trying to get some help.'

Many people who knew the family described Smith as friendly and outgoing, an assessment shared by his mother.

'He was very talented, and artistic, and a perfectionist, and a very devoted family man,' she said.

The bodies of the mother and father along with their three young children were found in the Saco, Maine apartment after the murder-suicide
