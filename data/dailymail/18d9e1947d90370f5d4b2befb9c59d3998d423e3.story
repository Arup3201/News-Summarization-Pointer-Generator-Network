Payday loan firms are using catchy tunes and funny puppets to ‘groom’ children to become the borrowers of the future, it was claimed yesterday.

The firms stand accused of using daytime TV adverts to convince youngsters that the loans, which can charge more than 5,000 per cent APR interest, are normal.

Some are so influenced by commercials for companies such as Wonga, the biggest lender, that they parrot their slogans and put pressure on parents to take out loans to buy things they want, such as toys and games, MPs heard.

Puppets: Martin Lewis condemned the use of adverts designed to appeal to children and 'normalise' borrowing

Martin
 Lewis, the founder of website Moneysavingexpert.com, called for the ads
 to be banned from children’s TV. He said: ‘These lenders are 
essentially grooming children to be the next generation of borrowers.’

Peter
 Tutton, of debt charity StepChange, said there was ‘explosive’ growth 
in the number seeking help with payday loans, on top of other debts. He 
said: ‘Is the payday lending industry taking advantage of people who are
 struggling? Our evidence suggests that they are.

‘In a sense people are in a hole, and a payday loan is helping them dig that hole deeper.’

Ban: Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert said adverts for payday lenders should not be allowed on children's TV

Labour
 is considering backing a cap on interest rates for payday loans, 
following Australia, parts of Europe, and some US states.

Consumer
 groups told MPs on the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee
 that a voluntary regime set up by lenders to police the way loans are 
sold has failed.

Mr 
Lewis said: ‘The payday loan industry insists it is not targeting 
children, but our research shows that kids are being dazzled by catchy 
tunes and cute puppets.

‘The current explosion in the number of people borrowing in this way is nothing compared to how the next generation will act.’

A
 poll of 3,000 people on his site found 70 per cent of under-16s have 
seen TV ads for payday loans. Thirty per cent of parents with children 
ten and under said their youngsters repeated payday loan ad slogans.

One in seven – 14 per cent – had been pestered by their child to take out a loan to buy them something.

Mr
 Lewis said: ‘Payday lenders are now so profitable they have huge 
advertising and film budgets, which bring in more customers, making even
 more profit. This vicious circle means we now see these loans 
normalised.  That’s why we need legislation or regulation.’

Gillian Guy, the head of Citizens Advice, said: ‘It reminds me of the old days of cigarette advertising.‘There are no health warnings . . . nothing about the dangers [payday loans] represent.’

Lesley
 Titcomb, chief operating officer at the Financial Conduct Authority, 
the City watchdog, was asked why she thought such lenders advertise 
between children’s shows.

Crisis: Labour leader Ed Miliband launched an outspoken attack on payday lenders, who accused of targetting vulnerable people who are threatened and bullied when they get into financial trouble

Stories: In a speech at Battersea Power Station Mr Miliband said he had met people who had fallen foul of threats and bullying by payday lenders

She
 said: ‘I imagine there are two reasons – one is that mothers will be 
watching with their children, and the other . . . is pressure from the 
children on the parents.’

Wonga
 said it already has a self-imposed ban on commercials around children’s
 TV. However, it does run ads in the daytime, when children are 
watching, and in family shows.

Bosses
 from Wonga and other leading firms also gave evidence to MPs, insisting
 the vast majority of their customers are satisfied.

They
 denied taking advantage  of the vulnerable, failing to make proper 
checks on their ability to pay money back, or harassing those who fall 
behind on payments.

Grilling: Payday lenders including Wonga, Mr Lender and QuickQuid were called to give evidence by the Business, Innovation and Skills committee

Wonga’s 
head of public affairs, Henry Raine, told MPs: ‘Wonga’s business is 
aiming to lend to people who can pay us back, that’s how we make money. 
The vast majority of people pay us back on time.’

Mr
 Raine said around 3 per cent of people, or some 40,000 of Wonga’s 
1.25million customers, cannot pay their loans back within 60 days. He 
said: ‘We do everything we can to lessen the effect of bad debt.’

Yesterday
 Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘They are responsible for a quiet 
crisis of thousands of families trapped in unpayable debt.

‘The
 Wonga economy is one of the worst symbols we have of the cost-of-living
 crisis.’ A Wonga spokesman said: ‘While we recognise that there have 
been unacceptable practices in the sector, Wonga has been instrumental 
in raising standards.’
