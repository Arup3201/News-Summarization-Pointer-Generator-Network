Tobey Maguire is facing a lawsuit after allegedly being involved in an illegal gambling ring.

The Spider-Man actor is claimed to be one of dozens of Hollywood actors who took part in the high-stakes poker games, Star magazine reported.

The games allegedly took place in a number of luxury hotels suites unlicenced for gambling, and even the home of film producer Rick Salomon, star of the Paris Hilton sex tape.

Maguire, 35, is said to have won more than $300,000 from a convicted Beverly Hills hedge fund manager over a number of years.

The $25m-a-film actor performed more like Superman than Spider-Man as he allegedly raked in an astonishing $40m in total from the illicit gambling ring.

Facing lawsuit? It has been claimed that actor Tobey Maguire will be facing a suit, who was seen here at LA Airport last week

Other A-list Hollywood celebrities 
are also said to have played the no-limit Texas Hold ‘em games, 
including Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.

The magazine claimed that the poker games were held twice a week in luxury suites at a hotel in Beverly Hills.

Star reported that the player in debt to Maguire was CEO of Ruderman Capital Partners, Brad Ruderman, who was using company funds.

He is behind bars after being  convicted of two
counts of wire fraud and two counts of investment advisor fraud and 
will stay in a Texas jail until 2018.

The FBI allege that he lost $25million of investor money in the clandestine poker games.

The
CEO’s clients have hired lawyers to file civil law suits against those 
who won large sums in the poker games, such as Maguire, to try and recover some of their 
lost savings.

The lawsuit filed against Maguire in 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles said the games were ‘exclusive 
events, by invitation only, and that there was a regular roster of 
players consisting of wealthy celebrities, entrepreneurs, attorneys and 
businessmen.

Others being sued include film director Nick Cassavetes, Welcome Back Kotter TV star Gabe Kaplan, billionaire businessman Alec Gores and Salomon. 

‘As
part of the scheme, funds invested in (Ruderman) were transferred to 
persons such as Defendant (Maguire), who received the funds on account 
of Ruderman’s gambling losses and on account of Defendant’s gambling 
winnings,’ Radar Online reported from court documents.

Mr Ruderman is said to have lost 
£311,300 to Maguire and it is claimed part of that amount was lost to 
the actor on July 30, 2007 of the amount of $110,000.

This is a $69,200 cheque allegedly received by Tobey Maguire during an illegal high stakes poker game in 2007. Ruderman is said to have written the check to Maguire after losing out to him in a game

Star magazine quotes a source as claiming that Maguire won approximately $1million per month 
over a three-year period and so could have pocketed 'up to $30 to $40 million'.

Playing
for money at underground poker clubs is illegal under Californian law, 
but Star reported that none of the participants are under criminal 
investigation.

But
it is understood that the 35-year-old Seabiscuit star has hired a 
lawyer to defend the allegations made against him, claiming the games 
were not illegal.

Dan Blizerian, one of the Hollywood 
poker sharks being sued in connection with the illegal gambling ring has
blasted Macguire, claiming he is tight-fisted.

'He's cheap as f*** and plays like a 
cheap b****... a guy who's worth all that money playing as if he's 
broke. Come on, dude,' Blizerian, who is facing a $100,00 lawsuit, told 
Star.. 

Claims: The 35-year-old is said to have won over $300,000 from a Beverly Hills hedge fund manage

TMZ claims that some of the games 
took place at a property purchased by Salomon with the proceeds from his
sex tape with Paris Hilton

Meanwhile, RadarOnline claims to have 
unmasked the woman who organised the gambling events, at hotels 
including the Beverly Hills Hotel, the Four Seasons and the Viper Room 
on Sunset Boulevard.

Molly Bloom, the sibling of two-time 
Olympic skier and Philadelphia Eagles player Jeremy Bloom, was claimed 
to be the sexy go-to-girl who co-ordinated the sophisticated operation.

Star Magazine claims she was behind everything from employing the croupiers, providing food and drink, down to the guest list.

It is also alleged that some of the games involving the high-profile stars were manned by armed guards in bulletproof vests.
