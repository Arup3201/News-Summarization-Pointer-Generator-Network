Reality TV show star Bristol Palin is asking conservatives to celebrate the Supreme Court's landmark contraception mandate decision by participating in a Hobby Lobby Love Day this Thursday.

Shortly after the high court handed down its decision affirming the family-owned company's right to abstain from an Obamacare mandate that violates its religious beliefs, Palin called on her fans to support the Christian craft store by making a special trip to the store on July 3.

'The Supreme Court says that Obama can’t force Hobby Lobby to provide 
“contraception” that cause abortions. Way to go, Hobby Lobby!!' Palin said in a blog post announcing the nationwide effort.

'We should all go to Hobby Lobby and buy something to celebrate.'

Yesterday the court ruled that Hobby Lobby and other 'closely-held' businesses with religious ties were eligible for exemption from a provision of the health care law that requires companies to provide their employees with health plans that cover 'preventative services' for women.

Hobby Lobby challenged the government on the grounds of religious freedom, stating that it would go against its strongly held religious beliefs to pay for plans that provide access to contraceptives that prevent pregnancy after conception such as the morning after pill.

The court sided with Hobby Lobby, saying that businesses that are majority owned by less than five people are afforded the same religious liberty protections as individuals.

In observance of the court's decision, Palin asked conservatives yesterday to take photos of themselves shopping at Hobby Lobby this Thursday and send them to her.

'It can be with your favorite product, a cashier, or a selfie with the
 store logo in the background,' Palin said, noting that pro-Hobby Lobby signs should be prominently featured in the photos as well.

'If I did that, mine might say “You can’t make us!” ' the pro-life activist wrote.

'No matter what your photo says, buying something at Hobby Lobby will send a strong message.'

Palin, a single mom whose teen pregnancy became political fodder during the 2008 presidential election after he mother Sarah Palin was named the Republican vice-presidential nominee, said she would post the best Hobby Lobby Love photos to her blog and social media accounts.

'Thank you for having the guts to stand up to an overreaching President who’s trying to re-make America into his own image,' Palin, a former Dancing with the Stars contestant, said in her online ode to Hobby Lobby.

'It’s a great day for all Americans.'
