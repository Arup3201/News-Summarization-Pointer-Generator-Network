Government troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo are making a final push to crush the M23 rebellion which has been controlling areas  near the Ugandan border for over a year.

In an attempt to quell the last of the rebel troops, the DRC army seized the insurgents' final remaining stronghold in the eastern province of North Kivu, near the Ugandan border.

Exchange of gunfire between DRC government troops and the M23 rebels have been confirmed with at least one young girl caught in crossfire, locals have said.

The DRC government launched an offensive on the M23 rebels last week and have since been carrying out operations to eliminate rebel resistance in territory near the Ugandan border.

‘The soldiers spent the night here and then went to the front’ at dawn, a resident in the border town of Jomba said, as mortar fire could be heard in the background.

A source in the UN mission in DR Congo (MONUSCO), which is helping the army, said the offensive against the M23 was in ‘the last phase’, after the army captured the main rebel base at Bunagana on Wednesday.

Diehard M23 fighters, estimated at just a few hundred men, were dug in on three hills in farming territory about 50 miles north of Goma, the capital of strife-torn North Kivu province.

The DRC army (FARDC) ‘has encircled the residual M23 positions to dislodge them. The operation is under way,’ the source said.

The M23, an abbreviation of The March 23 Movement, is also known as the Congolese Revolutionary Army, based in east DRC.

The rebellion takes its name from a peace treaty signed between the DRC milita group National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) and the DRC government on March 23, 2009, which saw the ethnic Tutsi former rebels incorporated into the Congolese army.

In April 2012, nearly 300 soldiers, a majority of which were former members of the CNDP, turned against the government  and formed the M23 rebellion, claiming the terms of the 2009 peace treaty had not been fully implemented.

The group took control of several areas in the North Kivu province, including the capital of Goma, which has a population of one million, in November 2012, holding the city for ten days.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo and the UN claim that the M23 is backed by neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda, an allegation the 
two countries strongly deny.

Since fighting resumed on October 25, after peace talks collapsed in Uganda, no UN troops have directly taken part in the offensive, but MONUSCO has provided government forces with intelligence, reconnaissance and logistical help.

After the fall of the rebel 
headquarters at Bunagana, President Joseph Kabila on Wednesday again 
urged the M23 fighters to ‘demobilise voluntarily’, warning that his men
would otherwise ‘make them do so by force’.

Kabila said that ‘political and 
diplomatic solutions’ remained on the negotiating table in Uganda's 
capital Kampala, where the rival sides have held stop-start talks since 
December and their representatives expressed guarded optimism.

‘The negotiations are making progress,’ M23's deputy delegation chief Roger Lumbala said at midday Thursday.

‘Maybe today, they will have finished and we can put an accord on the table to sign it.’

The conflict has displaced hundreds of thousands of people in North Kivu, a densely populated province rich in precious minerals and agricultural produce that has been a battleground for soldiers, rebels and militias for more than two decades.

Some 5,000 civilians crossed into Uganda at Bunagana between Monday and Wednesday, according to the United Nations, but on Thursday the refugees started trying to return to their homes in DR Congo.

‘This morning we crossed back to go to our fields, but soldiers told us to turn round,’ said Imelda Nyirankusi, who had eight children in tow and a baby on her back. ‘We had the impression that gunshots were getting nearer.’

Imelda said that she had fled Bunagana the previous day and then returned to Uganda after her bid to go back. The soldiers had ‘slit the throat of one of my fat cows... and eaten it, saying it was a Tutsi cow, an M23 cow,’ she added.

‘How do you want me to go home if people kill my cows and make me feel I'm not wanted?’ Imelda asked.
