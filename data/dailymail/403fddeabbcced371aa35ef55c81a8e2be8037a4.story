Barbara Walters made an on-air dig at Elizabeth Vargas over her battle with alcohol addiction during an interview on The View on Thursday - causing silence to fall over the set.

The 20/20 anchor, who publicly revealed her addiction last month, appeared on the show to speak about her struggle with anxiety and her recovery.

She said that she had worked hard to keep the addiction a secret from her ABC colleagues, which 'became a very isolating and lonely place to be'.

'We all knew,' Walters said. 'I am very fond of Elizabeth and proud of her. But we knew... It was public at that point.'

'No it wasn't,' Vargas responded, looking at the host.

'But we all knew,' Walters returned.

Vargas looked at her in shock as the other women on the set fell silent.

One witness told Page Six that Vargas looked 'like she had been slapped in the face, and the atmosphere turned Polar Vortex'.

Walters later called Vargas to apologize, the page reported.

'I love Elizabeth and have great admiration for her,' Walters told Page Six. 'I never would have deliberately said anything to hurt her, and I called to tell her that.'

Elizabeth added: 'This is silly! Barbara is a colleague and a friend.'

The interview came a couple of weeks after Vargas went public about her battle with alcoholism.

She had taken a leave of absence in October to seek treatment and returned to 20/20 in January.

'I
 am an alcoholic,' Vargas told George Stephanopoulos as she returned. 
'It took me a long time to admit that to myself. It took me a long time 
to admit it to my family, but I am.'

She told The View that, after her father went to Vietnam when she was six-years-old, she began suffering from daily panic attacks that have continued into her adult life.

She began relying on glasses on wine and hid the addiction from her colleagues. Her husband, Grammy Award-winning singer Marc Cohn, was the only one who knew about her struggles.

When he confronted her, the ABC anchor recalled feeling 'really angry' while acknowledging that he was right.

However, it took her a long time to seek treatment because Vargas said she did not want to feel like a failure and was still able to function in her daily life.

She recalled that her â€˜aha' moment came one day when she arrived at work to film a '20/20' segment and realized that she was too drunk to do it.

Now after treatment, she is beginning to cope with the anxiety she felt for years.

'I know how to sit through the anxiety - that doesn't mean I don't feel it,' she said. 'But it's amazing now that I'm not drinking that the anxiety's much less and I know that I have people I can call, people who love me. I know I can reach out to them and that I can get through it.'
