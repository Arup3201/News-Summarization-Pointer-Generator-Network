Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao today warned that the country needs to embrace democracy and make urgent political reforms.

Mr Wen said that the changes are needed to prevent China's economy from faltering and to spread wealth more evenly.

He vowed to use his last year in power to attack mounting discontent that he warned could end in chaos - and may even see a new Cultural Revolution.

Call for change: Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao today warned that the country needs to embrace democracy and make urgent political reforms

The reference was to the tumultuous period between 1966 and 1976 when Chairman Mao Zedong persecuted members of his own Communist Party in a desperate bid to reimpose his iron rule.

In a three-hour news conference, his sole such event of the year, Mr Wen said: 'A historical tragedy like the Cultural Revolution could occur again. Each party member and cadre should feel a sense of urgency.'

Mr Wen renewed a call for unspecified political reforms, particularly of the Communist Party leadership, saying that without them China's hard-won prosperity might fizzle.

The Cultural Revolution, also known by its full title of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, took place in China between 1966 and 1976.

It was set in motion by Chairman Mao Zedong (pictured) of the Communist Party in May 1966 to combat what he saw as corrosive Western influences.

This was done by removing cultural, capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society.

The revolution saw Mao regain his iron rule, but affected the country both economically and socially.

'Revisionists' suspected of trying to filter Western elements into Chinese society were removed through violence.

It is estimated that up to 1.5million people were killed during the struggle, although a true figure will never be known. Roughly the same number suffered permanent injuries.

The tumultuous period ended following Mao's death in 1976.

He said: 'Reform has reached a critical stage. Without the success of political reform, economic reforms cannot be carried out. The results that we have achieved may be lost.'

No democratic firebrand, Mr Wen has issued similarly vague pleas before - and become a popular if lone voice among senior leaders by doing so. This time his tone was more emphatic, as was the setting.

The news conference was his last scheduled briefing before the prim 69-year-old steps down in a year after a decade in office.

He said he is 'seized by a strong sense of responsibility' to speak out and referred repeatedly to the judgement of history.

The recurring references to the past and the wistful, reflective tone turned the premier's news conference into something of a swan song for the most popular member of the usually remote leadership.

Sometimes called 'Grandpa Wen', he comes across as warm and caring. He has been shown eating dumplings with coal miners and consoling survivors of the devastating Sichuan earthquake and other disasters.

As the number three in the party leadership who is primarily responsible for the economy, Mr Wen fielded a range of questions, from local government debt to currency reform.

He offered Chinese funding of U.S. infrastructure projects to create American jobs and rebalance lopsided economic ties with a crucial trading partner.

He sidestepped a question asking his views of the democratic uprisings in parts of the Arab world.

Mr Wen sounded resolute on government
efforts to deflate a property bubble, saying 'home prices in China are 
far from coming back to a reasonable level'.

The Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets swooned, bucking the trend in markets elsewhere buoyed by strong Wall Street gains.

Mr Wen, President Hu Jintao and most of the leadership are stepping down to hew to unwritten rules of succession and make way for younger leaders.

The turnover always invites divisive infighting that the party prefers to keep under wraps.

He retires next year along with President Hu Jintao after a decade in power which has seen China grow to become the world's second-biggest economy, but which is likely to see 2012 deliver the slowest rate of annual growth during their leadership.

A reflective Mr Wen said: 'Due to my incompetent abilities and institutional and other factors, there is still much room for improvement in my work.

'I should assume responsibility for the problems that have occurred in China's economy and society during my term in office for which I feel truly sorry.'
