The Duchess of Cornwall was among those who attended the Service of Thanksgiving for the 11th Duke of Marlborough, John Spencer-Churchill, at the Guard's Chapel in London today.

She joined a number of dignified guests including the late Duke's heir, Jamie Spencer-Churchill,   at the ceremony to commemorate the life of the man affectionately known as 'Sunny'.

Jamie, the 12th Duke of Marlborough, arrived at the chapel with his second wife Edla and children Lord Caspar, six, and Lady Araminta, seven.

He inherited the Oxfordshire family seat, Blenheim Palace, after his father died aged 88 on 16 October last year.

The Duchess of Cornwall looked elegant in a feathered black hat and tailored black coat as she left the chapel holding a service programme that was printed with a portrait of the late duke.

Her son, Tom Parker-Bowles, was also in attendance, as was the Duke's widow, Lily Mahtani, and his grandson, George Spencer-Churchill, Marquess of Blandford.

His third wife, Rosita Spencer-Churchill, remembered her former husband alongside their son, Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill.  

Sir Nicholas Soames, grandson of Sir Winston Churchill, was on-hand to greet guests as they arrived. 

The Service of Thanksgiving comes nearly four months after the Duke's death, when a solemn funeral was held on the grounds of Blenheim Palace.

His coffin was carried in a horse-drawn carriage through the parkland of his 11,500-acre estate, before reaching a private service.

Hundreds of people lined the streets of Woodstock to watch the funeral cortege pass by on its way to the church, where the new Duke of Marlborough gave a reading, as did his siblings Lady Alexandra, Lord Edward, and Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill.

Sir Mark Weinberg also gave a tribute, and the Rector of the Benefice of Blenheim, Rev Canon Adrian Daffern, said the Duke was a 'man of authority, tempered by his humanity.'

The 11th Duke married four times; first WHSmith heiress Susan Hornby, mother of his first three children, two of whom survive, second Athina Onassis, with whom he had no children, third Rosita Douglas-Sjernorp, mother of his three younger children, two of whom survive, and fourth, Persian-born Lily Mahtani. 

His four children are the Marquess of Blandford, Lady Henrietta Spencer-Churchill, 56, Lord Edward Spencer-Churchill, 40, and Lady Alexandra Spencer-Churchill, 38.

The marquess, his eldest surviving child, battled addictions to heroin and cocaine and three spells in prison, which resulted in his father taking legal action to prevent him from inheriting the 11,500-acre estate, where Churchill was born.

During this time the 11th Duke and his son the Marquess of Blandford were estranged for more than 20 years, but in 2008, in a move largely credited to behind the scenes work by the Duke's fourth wife, Lily Mahtani, they were finally reunited after a reconciliation.

The 12th Duke and his second wife, Welsh ceramicist Edla Griffiths, who was said to have been a stabilising influence on him, moved into a farmhouse on the Blenheim estate and he was given a role developing the Blenheim farm shop.

The Blenheim estate is one of Britain's most notable tourist attractions, and it was the Duke's life's work to preserve it for future generations.

A gift from Queen Anne to John Churchill, the first Duke of Marlborough, in 1704, it was a reward for his victory over the army of Louis XIV of France in the Spanish War of Succession.

Winston Churchill was born at Blenheim, which became a world heritage site under the stewardship of the 12th Duke. The 200,000sq ft estate has 187 rooms, dwarfing Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle,and attracts about 500,000 visitors every year.

Its grandeur registered even with Hitler. According to wartime lore, he planned to move in after invading England and ordered the Luftwaffe not to bomb it.
