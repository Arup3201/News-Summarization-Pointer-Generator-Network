If a fresh brew, scones and cucumber sandwiches are not your cup of tea, never fear — the traditional afternoon tea has gone wild.

Get a golden ticket to the Chesterfield Mayfair hotel and you can indulge in a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory-themed tea (£32.50 per person). Wonka Bars, Oompa Loompa cupcakes and candy canes of all colours adulterate the usual offering at the hotel.

At the Great John Street Hotel in Manchester, men can ditch the ladylike touches.

The Gentleman Jack afternoon tea (from £19.50 per person) boasts canapé-style bites including seared steak, hot pot pies, chunky chips and scotch eggs ... all in miniature portions.

Or go for an Italian at Hotel Missoni in Edinburgh (from £20.50 per person), with amaretto gelato, salted caramel macaroons and pastries.

Peter Jones in Chelsea is celebrating the Chelsea Flower Show. Here the table centrepiece is a glass pot of blooming tea, with the tea leaves blossoming into a flower on contact with hot water. Elderflower scones arrive on fine china decorated with edible flowers (£19.95 for two).

The Moroccan tea at The Spa in Dolphin Square, Pimlico (from £12), includes a choice of spiced teas alongside dates, pistachios and sweet treats.

Gentlemen Jack's afternoon tea offers none of the traditional fare, but instead miniature versions of hamburgers and even seared stakes

The Not Afternoon Tea at the Oxo Tower (£24.50 per  person) gets rid of the tea altogether and replaces it with bespoke cocktails.

And at G & Teatime’s gin-tasting teas, held in 12 cities across the country, you’ll learn how to make a perfect G&T and martini along with an afternoon tea with sandwiches, scones and cakes (£79 for a 90-minute session with six gin tastings).
