Reality TV star, fashion face, fake tan ambassador, PETA campaigner and style blogger...Is there anything Lucy Watson can't do? Apparently not.

The Made In Chelsea star, who is currently filming for the hit E4 reality TV show in New York, has just unveiled her new jewellery collection.

Creature is a 15-piece jewellery collection created by animal lover Lucy, who was inspired by nature and her surroundings growing up on a farm in Surrey.

Involved in a number of activities for the prevention of cruelty to animals, including a recent global PETA campaign, Lucy, 23, wanted to create a brand that stayed true to her ideals and allowed people to share her passion for animals.

The collection is made from sterling silver and gold plate and features a range of products, including tiger teeth earrings, a snake fang ring, and Lucy’s favourite: shark jaw earrings.

Speaking about her latest project, which ranges in price from £40-£150, she said: 'I wanted to invest my time into a brand that I truly believed in.

Animal inspired: Lucy, who poses with fake scratch marks, said: 'I have always been an animal lover, and I thought it was the perfect way to bridge the gap between fashion and animals, making high quality, affordable jewellery, inspired by something I am legitimately interested in'

'It was really important for me to feel passionately about this project, as I am committed to making it a successful range, that I will endeavour to work on for the foreseeable future.

Lucy's management said: 'Lucy has been planning Creature for over a year now. She re-did the designs again and again, and has used local manufactures in London to ensure quality and control.

'Lucy has been involved in every process, and has invested money she has saved into the business. At heart, Lucy is a savvy business woman, and she wants to create a viable business for her to run, as she knows that the opportunities she has now may not always be available to her.'

Selective: Lucy's agent told MailOnline that Lucy, who dresses as a vamp in her new campaign, has made the choice to be super careful about who she works with

Lucy's career is going from strength to strength. She was recently 
unveiled as the new face - and smooth legs - of Wilkinson Sword, the face of Skinny Tan, as well as Lipsy VIP and has her own book, The Dating Game.

Lucy also recently posed naked for a PETA campaign, modelled for 
Vesper dresses and has been working on her jewellery range.

Lucy's agent told MailOnline: 'Deliberately, Lucy has made the choice to be super 
careful about who she works with. Over exposure is really common with 
reality television stars, and for Lucy, it's always been about the long 
game. She has turned down far more deals than she has approved.'

Entrepreneur: Lucy, who rocks contact lenses and vampire teeth, was recently unveiled as the new face - and smooth legs - of Wilkinson Sword, the face of Skinny Tan, as well as Lipsy VIP and has her own book, The Dating Game

Lucy launched her jewellery brand, 
Creature, at the beginning of 2014, and has worked in an ambassadorial 
role for a number of brands.

'Lucy is looking to develop her 
profile in the health and fitness arena, and is looking forward to 
promoting awareness about animal testing, through exploring 
opportunities around creating her own range, as well as wanting to 
create a documentary drawing attention to the issue.

All smiles: The star is currently in New York 
filming the Made In Chelsea spin-off, and she also took to Instagram to 
show off pictures of herself with former flame and co-star Jamie Laing 
in the Big Apple

'Lucy has a number of meetings in LA 
and New York planned for the summer, and she has been approached with 
some exciting international opportunities,' added the source.

Speaking about plans for the future, Lucy told MailOnline: 'I
want to stay in the industry and being on MIC has taught me loads about
working behind-the-scenes producing and directing, which I love, so 
maybe one day I will look into that.

'I also love presenting and would love to have my own show,' she said.
