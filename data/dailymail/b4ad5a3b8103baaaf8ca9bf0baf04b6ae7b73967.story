Even in the animal kingdom, domestic disputes have to be settled, and in this case it is pretty easy to figure out who won.

A female brown bear roar inches away from the snout of a male with such fury that it must surely have been about something more serious than taking out the trash.

The quarreling couple were spotted in a natural park in northern Spain, proving that the 'Latina temper' is not just a myth.

Spanish photographer Manuel Bruned, 25, was visiting the Cabarceno Natural Park in Santander, when he saw the angry bear.

‘This female bear let out a huge roar at one of the other bears,’ explains Mr Bruned, of Zaragoza, Spain.

‘She must have been angry at him for something, but it was so loud and powerful that I still hear the sound in my mind.

‘When I was a kid I watched many wildlife documentaries and this was the first time I was able to capture bears in their natural environment.

‘It was a dream come true.’

Manuel watched from 150ft away as the female slowly approached the male bear, before letting out her huge roar.

The natural park is located in a former open cast iron mine in northern Spain.

Cabarceno Natural Park has two roles: one is the conservation of endangered species and the other is environmental education.

Manuel says: ‘I do not like zoos as I feel most of the animals have issues when they are kept inside.

‘However, Cabarceno is different, as they have a very natural habitat and they look very happy to be there.

‘We have to change the idea of what a zoo should be.’
