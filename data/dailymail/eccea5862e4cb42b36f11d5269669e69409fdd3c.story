They are not natural bedfellows.

But publishing firm Haynes has blamed hit erotic novel Fifty Shades of Grey for the recent poor sales performance of its car manuals - a DIY bible for aspiring mechanics.

Haynes claims that its readers are turning their backs on its own books in favour of the racy book by author E L James, a former TV executive, wife and mother of two from west London.

Haynes said in its financial results: 'There is little doubt that during the period, retail purchasing budgets were tight and that much of those available budgets went towards the phenomenally successful Fifty Shades series.

'Our books, in the most part, appeal to automobile and motorcycle enthusiasts.

'They are probably oriented to a male audience and I am not sure that Fifty Shades is the kind of thing they would enjoy, but that phenomenon is impacting general publishing budget.'

Haynes was established in 1960 and its first manual, Haynes Owners Workshop Manual, for the Austin-Healey Sprite, was published in 1965.

Books by Haynes have been regarded as a bible for amateur mechanics ever since they were first published in 1965

Meanwhile, Fifty Shades of Grey, first 
published in May 2011, has become the fastest-selling book of all time, 
shifting more than five million copies in the UK.

It's success has been attributed to the soaring use of e-book readers, such as the Amazon Kindle. They have allowed people to read the saucy novel without being embarrassed by its contents.

Haynes is not Fifty Shades of Grey's only victim.

The publisher of Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, Quercus, has admitted that the raunchy book has dented its sales too.

Quercus chief executive Mark Smith said the 'unprecedented success' of Fifty Shades of Grey had contributed to the decline of the Swedish novels.

Fifty Shades of Grey has helped one corner of the retail market though.

Adult retail chain Ann Summers has reported rocketing sales of its sex toys since the novel hit bookshelves across the country last year.

It has seen a phenomenal 200 per cent increase for jiggle balls, a 60 per cent rise in sales of blindfolds and a 35 per cent increase in the number of rope ties it was selling.

Online sex toy retailer LoveHoney has 
also enjoyed a boost. It has witnessed a 109 per cent increase in 
revenue from bondage items.
