Monster Spanish slugs that feed on dead rabbits and grow to up to 15cm long could spell disaster for British crops and threaten to wipe out local species entirely.

The giant pests - which invaded our shores in salad brought in from Europe - are mating with their British counterparts to create a mutant super-slug with the potential to overrun our back gardens.

Experts say the slimy Spanish pests can decimate whole crops, and warn they could eventually wipe out native slugs altogether as they produce hundreds more eggs than the typical British variety.

Slug expert Les Noble, of Aberdeen University, told the Mirror that the Spanish breed were to the British variety what the conquistadors were to the Aztecs, adding that native slugs might become extinct.

'They are simply being overrun and when you consider the Spanish slug will happily make a meal out of a dead rabbit as much as out of dog muck you can see why they are so successful,' he said.

'We have already seen when these slugs move into an area the native slugs vanish almost immediately. They can wipe out whole crops and prevent them growing there again.'

Heavy rain and warm spells in Britain at the start of the summer provided the giant olive green pest with ideal breeding conditions.

At the time B&Q reported a 74 per cent increase in sales of slug pellets in its stores, amid sightings of the powerful invasive species in back gardens as far west as Wales and upland in the West Country.

In parts of the U.S. hybrid slugs have even posed a threat to drivers, as they leave behind huge slimy patches when they are squashed on roads.
