The FBI has released photos of three individuals wanted for questioning in last year's deadly attack on the U.S. consulate in Libya in a worldwide plea for information in the case.

The men were seen on the grounds of the consulate building on the day of the terror strike in Benghazi, and may have information that could aid the federal probe of the attack, which occurred on the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks.

Four Americans were killed in the six-hour assault, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Christopher Stevens, information management officer Sean Smith, and former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods.

In the photos released by the agency on Wednesday, each of the men appear to be holding guns.

The FBI said in a statement: 'We are seeking information about three individuals who were on the grounds of the U.S. Special Mission when it was attacked.'

'These individuals may be able to provide information to help in the investigation.'

Anyone with information regarding the Benghazi attack or the men in the photos are urged to text or e-mail the FBI at BenghaziTips@ic.fbi.gov or submit information confidentially at https://forms.fbi.gov/benghazi-en.

Lawmakers and independent investigators have blamed the State Department for 'security failures' in the months leading up to the assault.

Secretary of State John Kerry on Tuesday pledged full cooperation with lawmakers' queries into last year's assault on the U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, while his spokesman dismissed reports that whistleblowers faced retaliation.

'We're prepared to work openly and accountably to answer any of those questions,' Kerry told reporters.

'I'm determined that this will be an accountable and open State Department as it has been in the past and we will continue to provide answers,' he said.

Some Republicans continue to assail Obama over security lapses, but also over the administration's conflicting early accounts of what happened.

On Tuesday, two senior Republican senators, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona, reiterated their call for the Senate to set up a joint select committee to investigate the Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi attack.

'Revelations about witnesses being afraid to testify and military assets that could have been deployed in a timely fashion justify appointing a joint select committee,' they said in a statement.

Burning issue: Ambassador Chris Stevens and 
three other Americans were killed in a six-hour, commando-style attack 
on the consulate in Benghazi

The senators were apparently referring to a Fox News report on Monday which quoted a former Justice Department lawyer, Victoria Toensing, as saying that one of her clients and other State Department officials had been threatened with career damage by unnamed Obama administration officials.

Asked about the report, Kerry said 'there's been an enormous amount of misinformation out there.'

While repeating a vow to cooperate with lawmakers, he added: 'We have to demythologize this issue, and certainly depoliticize it.'

Pressed on the allegation that would-be witnesses at the State Department faced threats, the department's deputy spokesman Patrick Ventrell said: 'The State Department would never tolerate or sanction retaliation against whistleblowers on any issue, including this one.'

Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney added: 'We are unaware of any agency blocking an employee who would like to appear before Congress to provide information related to Benghazi.

Tragedy: Chris Stevens (in April 2011) became 
the U.S. ambassador to Libya in June 2012. He was killed along with 
three other Americans in an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on 
Sept. 11, 2012
