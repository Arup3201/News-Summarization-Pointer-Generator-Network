A woman in her fifties has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 93-year-old woman was found dead at home.

Police launched a murder inquiry after the pensioner's body was found at an address in Crimicar Lane, Sheffield, at around 9.05am this morning.

A woman in her 50s has been arrested on suspicion of murder and has been taken into police custody.

Sources have suggested that the arrested woman is a relation to the victim and police are classing it as a domestic incident. The 93 year-old has been named locally as Gladys Allen.

A post-mortem examination is expected to take place later today and inquiries are still ongoing.

Next door neighbour Frank Mellor said: 
'Gladys is in her nineties and she's not been out of the house for the 
last seven weeks or so.

'A little while before Christmas she had a fall and cracked a few ribs, I believe. I don't think she's been quite the same since then.

'I am still in shock to discover that somebody has been arrested in connection with her death.'

Neighbour Isabel Hippisly-Cox said: 'Gladys was very frail the last time I saw her, I had to give her a helping hand off the bus because she was struggling.'

Neighbour Alan Hunt said: 'I used to see Gladys on the bus regularly.

'She used to catch it into town to get her hair done and her shopping. I haven't seen her once this year, though. In fact I don't think I saw her inthe last few weeks of 2013 either.

'She is a lovely lady, but I think she has been under the weather recently.'
