Myleene Klass joked last night that in some parts of London buying a property for more than the  proposed £2million Mansion Tax threshold  would probably only stretch to a garage.

But  in fact it can secure a mansion in less fashionable parts of the capital and  something even grander outside London - usually with a swimming pool, huge drive and extensive grounds.

Nevertheless the singer humiliated Ed Miliband after she  unceremoniously took him to task  over Labour’s contentious policy, which would probably hit his own house in north London.

Appearing on ITV’s The Agenda, Miss Klass told him: ‘For me, it’s so disturbing – the name in its own right: “mansion tax”.

In the firing line: Ed Miliband's own home near Hampstead Heath, was bought in his then girlfriend, now wife Justine Thornton's name in 2009 for £1.6million, but is now thought to be worth around £2million

Battle royale: Myleene and Ed went toe-to-toe on TV over the mansion tax last night and the consensus from viewers was that the singer 'wiped the floor' with the Labour leader

She said: 'Immediately you conjure up an image of these Barbie-esque houses, but in London, which is where 80 per cent of the people who will be paying this tax actually live, have you seen what that amount of money can get you? It’s like a garage'. 

TV viewers provided a running commentary on Twitter, describing how the singer was ‘doing a Paxman’ and ‘wiping the floor’ with the man who hopes to be the next prime minister.

Mr Miliband tried to defend his policy but looked lost and bewildered as the former Hear'Say singer tore into his pledge to impose a tax on homes worth more than £2million. 

But Labour’s shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves slammed the singer’s claim that £2million would only get you a garage in the capital.

She told LBC radio: ‘Look the mansion tax and what she said on the mansion tax – that you can only get a garage in London for £2million – that is absolutely wrong.

‘My family have lived in South London for all of my life and for generations and you can certainly get more than a garage for £2million. I would say, what planet is she on?

However, the singer is right about garages being expensive, because last month one in Chelsea sold for an eye-watering £550,000.

Overall it is estimated that 108,000 homes – the vast majority in London and the South East – will be caught by the tax. 

This is what £2million can buy you: 

In Islington a four-bedroom terraced property was on sale for £2,000,000. A similar house on the same street sold for £430,000 in 1999, and is now estimated to be worth £2,036,764.

A four-bedroom semi-detached riverside home in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, was being sold with a guide price of £2,000,000, in an area where average prices have risen 19.34per cent in the last five years.

Just outside Glasgow, a four-bedroom former farm house is on sale with a guide price of £2,100,000. The property, which was completely rebuilt in 1999, boasts five acres of formal gardens and an open plan design. Other homes in the surrounding area have seen their value rise by an average of 2.88per cent in the last year.

In Oxford, semi-detached town houses in desirable parts of the city, where homes sold for around £400,000 in the mid-90s, are on sale for more than £2million. Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps has branded the mansion tax plan as an attack on ordinary taxpayers whose family home has soared in value.

This six-bedroom detached house in Formby, Merseyside is on sale for £2million, and boasts a heated swimming pool and a snooker room. Average prices on the street currently stand at £910,795 - an increase of 5.27per cent from five years ago. A neighbouring ten-bedroom property sold for £2million in 2005, and is now thought to be worth £2,152,966.

A guide price of £2,095,000 would buy this four-bedroom farmhouse near Ilkley, West Yorkshire, which comes complete with its own swimming pool and spa. Homes in the area sell for an average of £962,016, an increase of 12 per cent from 2009. Critics have also expressed fears that introducing such a tax would require every home to be accurately valued, which would lead to potentially lengthy appeals should homeowners disagree with the valuation - all of which would come at a cost.

Offers of around £2million are being taken for a four-bedroom farmhouse near Tregony in South Cornwall, an area where prices have gone up 7.56per cent since 2009. It could also put off wealthy foreign buyers from moving to the UK, and older people who purchased their homes before their value sky-rocketed and who now have a low-income could be forced to sell up and move as they would be unable to pay a new tax.

A three-bedroom detached house in Heddon-On-The-Wall, outside Newcastle Upon Tyne is on sale for £2.2m. There are also fears a mansion tax could put people off making modifications to their homes that might push up the value, having a negative knock on effect on the construction industry.

And for £550,000....

This dilapidated old shed, which doubled for a garage, in Chelsea, has been snapped up for £550,000 before it had a chance to go under the hammer
