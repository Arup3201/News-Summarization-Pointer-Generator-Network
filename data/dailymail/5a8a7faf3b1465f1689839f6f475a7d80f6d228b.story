A pensioner has been left stunned after a malicious phone call from a family of travellers led armed police to swoop on his vehicle while he was searching for his missing dog.

James McTear, 67, says that despite officers swarming around his Jeep in Workington, Cumbria, all they found were a pair of walking sticks - although his Spaniel was later discovered badly inured and needed to be put down.

Officers are believed to have arrived at the scene after a local traveller family falsely claimed Mr McTear was carrying a firearm and had threatened to set fire to their caravan and kill their children.

Accused: James McTear, 67, says officers swarmed his vehicle late on New Year's Eve. The businessman and his wife Anne, who runs the Cumberland Hotel in Workington, had been searching for their missing dog

Mr McTear, a businessman, said he’d been out late on New Year's Eve searching in heavy rain for a missing Spaniel that belonged to his granddaughter.

He says his only encounter with travellers that evening had been when he noticed an unlit caravan, van and a car blocking the road behind St Helen’s Business Park.

Mr McTear says that some time later, while driving past Northside roundabout near Workington on New Year’s Eve, he was pulled over by armed police.

'I saw flashing blue lights in my rear
 view mirror. I began to pull over towards the kerb to allow it to pass 
when it swerved in front,' he said.

He added: 'Three fully armed policemen got out, shouting at me while pointing their guns at my front and side windows... I didn’t have time to be scared, and my first reaction was one of anger.'

False: The traveller family claimed James McTear had a gun and had threatened to kill their children

The officers ordered Mr McTear to get out his vehicle and lay on the ground in heavy rain.

Blocking off the roundabout's exits, they began searching his Jeep but found only a pair of walking sticks.

Police later told Mr McTear that had pulled him over after reports of a disturbance at a local traveller site.

He subsequently found out that officers had even visited his wife Anne, who runs the Cumberland Hotel in Workington, after she too had been accused of assaulting the travellers.

Mrs McTear had been helping her husband search for the missing dog earlier in the evening but returned to the hotel to look after guests on a busy New Year's Eve.

The missing Spaniel, which belonged to Mr McTear's eight-year-old granddaughter Amelia, who tragically lost her mother to cancer last year, was later found badly hurt and needed to be put down.

It is thought the elderly dog had slipped and fallen onto railway lines in the dark, causing extensive injuries.

Police confirmed that they were called to the business park at 11.05pm following reports of a disturbance.

They were told that men in two vehicles had been causing problems, and that one was carrying a handgun and had made violent threats. 

A police spokesman added: 'Cars matching the description were located nearby and both were searched and no weapons found.

'The drivers were spoken to, and officers found no cause for concern.

'The cars had been in the St Helen’s Business Park area, but no offences were found to have taken place.'

Sergeant Peter Garforth said: 'When we received the report that a firearm may have been involved it was important to ensure that trained officers were available to deal with any possible scenario.

Thankfully in this case no weapons were found to be involved. 

'We have to take any reports of firearms seriously and our priority is to protect the public. 

'We would never wish to cause anyone unnecessary stress. However, we can only act on information available at the time.'
