Lava has reached empty lots of a Hawaii subdivision on Big Island Monday as officials eye evacuation routes for residents to escape the wrath of a nearby volcano. 

Residents of the Kaohe Homesteads have been eyeing the eruptions of the Kilauea volcano, as lava flows crossed onto vacant lots of the subdivision on a slow crawl to the northeast.

Hawaii County spokesman Kevin Dayton says lava from the volcano has slowed and there are no evacuations ordered.

Destruction: Lava flows reached empty lots of a remote development on Big Island, threatening to cut off roads and services

Officials say the lava is now moving about 750 feet per day, according to Hawaii News Now.

Meanwhile, work continues to prepare unpaved, defunct roads to be used as alternate routes if lava reaches a major highway. Officials say that could happen within weeks. 

Homeowners worry that if lava reaches the highway, they will be cut off from the rest of the island.

'If it goes north of us and cuts off the highway, we're afraid we're going to lose services such as electric, water, information services like telephone, internet,' property manager Russell Bellman told MailOnline last week.

One of the lots closest to the lava flow is government-owned land. Two others belong to private owners. 

Hawaii Volcano Observatory spokeswoman Janet Babb says the speed of lava depends on the supply of magma and what's going on inside the volcano.

Observatory scientists flew over the flow Monday and said lava is about three miles from the highway.

Danger: Residents hope the lava flow stops or moves out of the path of homes in the Kaohe Homesteads subdivision, a remote deelopment in 'paradise'

Smoke and fire: Lava from the Kilauea volcano burned through 10 miles of forest before threatening a small town

Keep out: Officials shut down the Wao Kele o Puna reserve and have worked to construct alternative evacuation routes

The lava has moved through more than 10 miles of forest after spewing out of an open vent in June.

The state closed the Wao Kele o Puna Forest Reserve last week until further notice out of safety concerns for visitors.

The lava has destroyed trees and vegetation as it slowly flows through the forest, and clouds of smoke can be seen from the town.

Steady rainfall has prevented fires from spreading from the lava, officials said.
