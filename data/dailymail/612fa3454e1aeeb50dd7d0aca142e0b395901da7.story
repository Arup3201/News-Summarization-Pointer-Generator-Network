The rivalry between TV channels Sky Sports and BT Sport looks set to hot up after details of the £5bn split of Premier League rights were revealed.

Sky seemed to get the better of the deal, securing five out of seven packages, including a new Friday night slot.

But with BT Sport securing rights for the Champions League and the Europa League from next season, Sky Sports, who have dominated football coverage for almost 25 years, seem to have a genuine rival for the first time.

Sky Sports pundits (left to right) Graeme Souness, Jamie Carragher, Thierry Henry, Jamie Redknapp and Gary Neville will have more matches to analyse than ever before

Setanta Sports acquired 42 out of 138 Premier League games between 2007 and 2009

168 games will be shown live between 2016 and 2019 as Richard Scudamore announced the £5.136bn deal, 14 more than which is currently available.

Setanta Sport were first to challenge Sky Sports for rights, acquiring 42 out of 138 between 2007 and 2009, while ESPN ammassed just 23 from 138 from 2009-13.

Here, Sportsmail looks at the tale of the tape between Sky Sports and BT Sport.
