The Equality and Human Rights Commission, chaired by Baroness Onora O'Neill (above), said the Human Rights Act has 'proved its value'

Tory MPs reacted angrily last night after a supposedly impartial £19million-a-year taxpayer-funded quango tore into the party’s plans to reform human rights law.

Despite there being under two months to the election, the Equality and Human Rights Commission piled into the political debate over the future of Labour’s Human Rights Act.

In a statement posted on the commission’s website, backed by a letter to MPs, it claimed that changes ‘to human rights laws that would water down the protections we all enjoy, would be “regressive” and undermine Britain’s reputation as a global leader that can challenge human rights abuses abroad’.

The quango also declared the Act a success, saying it had ‘consistently proved its value’.

This is despite the way it has been repeatedly used by foreign criminals and terrorists to avoid deportation.

The Tories have a manifesto commitment to scrap the Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights. 

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling also plans to give Britain’s Supreme Court the final say over human rights cases – not the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

But senior Conservative Party figures view the commission’s intervention as a nakedly political act.

As a quango, in receipt of £18.7million of public money last year, it is supposed to remain outside the political fray. Government sources said it had not even got its facts right.

In the letter to MPs, it said: ‘UK courts do not have to follow the judgements of the Strasbourg court. Our courts only need to take account of such judgements’.

But a senior government source said: ‘For a start, it is plain wrong to claim that our courts are not bound by decisions made by ECHR in Strasbourg. They are.

‘This taxpayer-funded quango of Labour’s creation is deliberately trying to play politics on the eve of an election.’

Tory MP Michael Ellis, part of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘This is grossly improper so close to an election from a quango which receives millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money.

Tory MPs blasted the online statement, calling it a nakedly political act, which had got its facts wrong. The post said British courts were not bound by the ECHR (pictured), when in fact they are

'This country was protecting human rights when many members of the EU were under dictatorships and well before Labour’s Human Rights Act, which has only served to create extra tiers of bureaucracy, legal costs, delays and an imbalance of justice.’

Fellow Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘The commission’s intervention shows just how politicised this self-serving quango has become.

‘Their blanket opposition to any re-balancing of our skewed human rights law ignores the concerns expressed by countless senior UK judges, and displays an arrogant contempt for the basic principle of democratic accountability we’ve lost in this area.’ 

The commission was established by Labour in 2006 ‘to protect and promote equality and human rights in Great Britain’.

In 2011, Home Secretary Theresa May decided to scale back its powers drastically after a report found the commission had ‘struggled’ to do its job, while providing low-quality work and poor value for money.

EHRC chief executive Mark Hammond said: ‘We are at a crossroads for human rights. One path risks undermining and diminishing our influence and status as a global leader in human rights and civil liberties.

‘The other will safeguard our reputation for fairness and moral authority when confronting human rights abuses abroad.’
