We are at the World Cup semi-final stage and the heavyweights of international football are getting ready to square up with Brazil and Germany, two of the biggest footballing powers on the planet, meeting on Tuesday in Belo Horizonte.

Brazil: the hosts and winners of five World Cups, the most in history. 
Germany: three-time victors who rarely fail to make the quarter-finals.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the likely starting XIs and how they match up against each other.

Relaxed: Brazil's Dani Alves (left) and David Luiz (right) train ahead of Tuesday's crunch semi-final

Julio Cesar (QPR) – Age 34, Caps 85

Barley played a club game last season but boss Luiz Felipe Scolari has kept faith and he was the penalty shootout hero in their last 16 win against Chile.

Mixed: Julio Cesar starred in the last 16 shootout win over Chile but gave away a spot-kick against Colombia

Manuel Neuer (Bayern Munich) – Age 28, Caps 50

Arguably the best goalkeeper in the world, and turning it on at this World Cup. Made some outstanding saves to send them through in the quarter-final against France.

Safe hands: Manuel Neuer has been in excellent form, keeping three clean sheets in five games so far

VIDEO All Star XI: Manuel Neuer highlights 

Verdict: The Germany goalkeeper has been a colossus in the tournament, keeping three clean sheets and conceding just three goals in five games, setting him apart from his counterparts.

Right-back

Dani Alves (Barcelona) – Age 31, Caps 79, International goals 6

Missed the last round, presumably to avoid suspension having been on one yellow card. One of the best full-backs in the game.

Back in action: Dani Alves was rested against Colombia but looks set to start against the Germans

Philipp Lahm (Bayern Munich) – Age 30, Caps 111, International goals 5

Played as a defensive midfielder in the early rounds, but now back to his favoured right-back position and dominating that flank.

Versatile: Philipp Lahm should keep his place at right-back after playing in midfield during the group stage

VIDEO All Star XI: Philipp Lahm highlights

Verdict: Dani Alves would win hands-down against most other right-backs, but not Lahm. He is the best out there in his position.

Marcelo (Real Madrid) – Age 26, Caps 36, International goals 4

Occasionally erratic in defence, fearless going forward. Marcelo adds an extra element of flair to Brazil's attack.

On the attack: Real Madrid defender Marcelo (right) will get forward for Brazil against Joachim Low's side

Benedikt Howedes (Schalke) – Age 26, Caps 26, International goals 2

Usually a centre-back for Schalke he has sacrificed his own comfort for the good of his country, but is yet to shine in the tournament.

Physical: Benedikt Howedes (front) holds off the challenge of France's Yohan Cabaye in the quarter-final

Verdict: Given Howedes is playing out of position, it has to go to Marcelo who can produce a moment of brilliance in a flash.

Centre-back

Dante (Bayern Munich) – Age 30, Caps 12, International goals 2

Expected to come in for the suspended Thiago Silva having been forced to watch the rest of the tournament from the bench. Under huge pressure.

Big opportunity: Bayern Munich's Dante looks set to replace the suspended Thiago Silva on Tuesday

Jerome Boateng (Bayern Munich) – Age 25, Caps 44, International goals 2

A solid centre-half but has been too often bailed out by goalkeeper Neuer throughout the tournament. Nonetheless, started every game for Germany.

Fortunate: Germany defender Jerome Boateng (right) has been made to look better by his keeper Neuer

Verdict: These two are polar opposites in this tournament – Boateng has played virtually every minute while Dante is starting cold. Based on that, the German wins it.

David Luiz (Chelsea) – Age 27, Caps 41, International goals 2

Nicknamed Sideshow Bob for his wild hairstyle, Luiz has been among the best entertainers at this summer's feast of football. After sealing a £50million move from Chelsea to Paris Saint-Germain, the 27-year-old will now take on the captain's armband in the absence of the suspended Thiago Silva as he bids to lead his country into the final. He has two goals in his last two games having not scored one for his country before the tournament.

Pure passion: David Luiz celebrates scoring a stunning free-kick against Colombia in the last eight

Mats Hummels (Borussia Dortmund) – Age 25, Caps 34, International goals 4

The defender is becoming one of the hottest properties on the market for his displays during this World Cup. Scored the winner against France when he outmuscled Raphael Varane to head in a free-kick.

Key man: Mats Hummels seured Germany's place in the semi-finals with the winning goal against France in Rio

Verdict: If it was sheer passion and putting on a show, David Luiz would get the nod. But defending is about solidity and reliability, and Hummels is streaks ahead in those departments.

Central midfield

Luiz Gustavo (Wolfsburg) – Age 26, Caps 23, International goals 1

Brazil's midfield enforcer has been kicking, thumping and bashing his way through this World Cup, to devastating effect. Back from a one-match suspension, he will be chomping at the bit.

Hard man: Luiz Gustavo (right) will attempt to break up Germany attacks in the centre of midfield

Sami Khedira (Real Madrid) – Age 27, Caps 50, International goals 4

Arsenal target Khedira has done little wrong but also little to inspire so far, although, in fairness, he has not played much for Real Madrid over the past year due to injury.

Solid: Real Madrid man Sami Khedira (left) has enjoyed a productive but unspectacular tournament so far

Verdict: Luiz Gustavo strikes fear into the heart of opponents, and it works.

Central midfield

Fernandinho (Manchester City) – Age 29, Caps 10, International goals 2

Has improved with age and was a key player for City in their title-winning season, but still very inexperienced in international football, especially for someone pushing 30.

Getting stuck in: Fernandinho (right) showed off the physical side of his game against James Rodriguez (left) when Brazil met Colombia

Bastian Schweinsteiger (Bayern Munich) – Age 29, Caps 106, International goals 23

He brings on to the pitch a wealth of experience and a decent scoring rate from central midfield. Has looked happier being the leader of the midfield again with Lahm's switch back to right-back.

Experienced: Bastian Schweinsteiger already has 106 caps and 23 goals for his country

Verdict: Schweinsteiger has 10 times as many caps as Fernandinho, despite being the same age, and is one of the most accomplished in the world at his position.

Hulk (Porto) – Age 27, Caps 39, International goals 9

Known for his pile-driver of a shot, but has still never scored for Brazil in a competitive match. His performances have been erratic in this tournament.

Room for improvement: Forward Hulk is yet to open his account for Brazil at the World Cup

Thomas Muller (Bayern Munich) – Age 24, Caps 54, International goals 21

His World Cup finals record says it all: 11 played, nine won, just one lost, having scored nine goals.

Danger man: Thomas Muller (left), pictured here scoring against the USA, has four goals to his name in Brazil

Verdict: Muller is far superior in almost every way. The German wins this easily.

Oscar (Chelsea) – Age 22, Caps 36, International goals 10

Oscar's form dipped midway through the season for Chelsea and that has carried into the World Cup. He has sporadically played well but has been far too erratic. The Brazilians will be looking to him to raise it with Neymar out.

Expectation: Oscar (left) will need to embrace more creative responsibility with talisman Neymar out injured

Toni Kroos (Bayern Munich) – Age 24, Caps 49, International goals 5

His passing ability is immense, but doesn't seem to score the amount of goals his position should warrant. And that is strange, as his goal against Arsenal in the Champions League demonstrated his shooting prowess.

Pass master: Bayern Munich's Toni Kroos (front) will look to dictate play from the centre of midfield

Verdict: A tough one to call, but Kroos edges it. His performances have been better in this tournament than Oscar's.

Left attacking midfield

Willian (Chelsea) – Age 25, Caps 10, International goals 2

Likely to be drafted into the side with Neymar out injured. Has featured little in the early rounds, coming on as a late subsitute three times.

Chance: Chelsea midfielder Willian is expected to replace the injured Neymar in Brazil's starting XI

VIDEO Willian ready to fill Neymar's boots

Mesut Ozil (Arsenal) – Age 25, Caps 60, International goals 18

The Arsenal man has had a quiet tournament, much like his first season in English football. Whenever he gets the ball it feels like something will happen, and then it doesn't.

Time to deliver: Mesut Ozil (left) has failed to shine for his country but he could play a major part for Low's side

Verdict: Ozil has to get this one, merely because Willian has barely played any football in the competition.

Striker

Fred (Fluminese) – Age 30, Caps 38, International goals 18

Luiz Felipe Scolari has defended Fred resolutely amid criticism for his lack of goals – just one, a header from an offside position two yards out – and overall play.

Flop: Striker Fred has scored once so far but has put in a series of poor performances for the Selecao

Miroslav Klose (Lazio) – Age 36, Caps 135, International goals 70

One of the greatest strikers in World Cup history. Needs just one goal, playing in his fourth World Cup, to become outright top-scorer in the tournament's history ahead of Ronaldo.

Motivation: Miroslav Klose (right) needs just one goal against Brazil to become the World Cup's all-time leading scorer

Verdict: Klose; no question.
