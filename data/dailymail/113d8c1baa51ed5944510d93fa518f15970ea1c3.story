Steven Gerrard is haunted by that momentary slip three matches from the end of last season which pulled the Anfield turf out from under Liverpool as Premier League champions-elect.

Given time to reflect plus the priceless gift of hindsight, his most vital loss of footing can now be seen as his stumbling failure nine years earlier to drive through a transfer to Liverpool’s opponents on that fateful April afternoon.

Chelsea, who capitalised on that rare Gerrard error to both defeat Liverpool and deflate their title challenge, had made a £32million bid for him in the summer of 2005.

Gerrard lifts the European Cup in 2005 after the greatest night of his professional career

That came just six weeks after he captained Liverpool to the greatest comeback in Champions League final history, that epic victory over AC Milan from 3-0 down in Istanbul.

Liverpool instantly rejected Chelsea’s offer.

But Gerrard, although still only 25, was already suspecting that if he was ever to win a Premier League title it would have to be with a different team. Sadly, he has been proved right.

In fact the drama and emotion of that astonishing night on the banks of the Bosphorous had brought him only temporary relief from that sense of foreboding, which had been nagging at him since Liverpool finished 30 points off the pace the preceding season.

So he asked for a transfer. Coming from a very local hero, that request was perceived as heresy by the Liverpool faithful and they took to burning replicas of his shirt in the streets.

As the protests reached a crescendo their Stevie G relented. Instead of insisting on his right to join the then-reigning League champions at Stamford Bridge, he signed a new £100,000 a week contract.

The rest, as we always say, is history. Except that for Gerrard  it is not historic.

Since 2005 he and Liverpool have won just one FA Cup and one League Cup – and still no Premier League medal for this valiant war-horse for whom the championship of England has been the Holy Grail since he signed for the club round the corner from his house at the age of eight.

Nor is he likely to get one now.

Chelsea, in that time, have won their first Champions League, four FA Cups, one League Cup, the Europa League once… and that Premier League title which Gerrard so covets, not once but twice.

Right now they lead the championship race by more points than Liverpool can remotely hope to retrieve and Gerrard is in his Last Chance Saloon, with the light fading.

Ah, what might have been.

Perhaps a life in English football would have been impossible for him, given how threatening the passions on Merseyside would have remained had he left the club for which he was born to play.

But for whatever reason he let his heart over-rule his head, these subsequent nine years have been overflowing from midfield with his commitment to a great club striving to recapture the glory days, and last season so close to doing so.

This has become a story of uplifting self-sacrifice in this age when footballers change clubs as often as their socks.

Loyalty, however, is oft rewarded by a kick in the head.

Gerrard was left out of what might well have been his last huge night in that hallowed red shirt – last month’s Champions League match at Real Madrid.

Then he was dropped on his 16th anniversary of becoming a Liverpool player

At 34, this one-club servant finds himself embroiled in turmoil as to whether Liverpool want to contract him to end his career with them – or if even he would prefer now to cash in on his last legs with a move to somewhere like the booming US soccer market.

Again, emotions are coming to the boil on Merseyside.

Players past and present are urging him to stay. The fans are petitioning the board to extend his contract.

And one of the outstanding players of his generation - the dyed-red Liverpool man who told true-blue Chelsea that he couldn’t quite bring himself to ‘jump off the cliff’ - finds himself back on the precipice. This time with the ground crumbling beneath his feet.

Let us hope he makes a happy landing. If the Premier League title is not to be, that is the least Steven Gerrard deserves.

Back to the Future - it's 1-0 to the Arsenal 

To the Arsenal, one-nil.

What is going on with the team that couldn’t hold on to a dog lead this season, until now.

Is it back to the future? Back to the days when one goal was invariably enough for the Gunners?

Perhaps not. The answer now seems to be scoring so late – as Alexis Sanchez did to beat Southampton on Wednesday night – that they only have to defend their lead for a minute or two.
