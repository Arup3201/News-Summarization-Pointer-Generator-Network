Sitting alone in her room on the 14th floor of a Chicago hospital, Sharon Hart needed some cheering up.

A week earlier the 48-year-old was shocked to learn what she thought was the stomach flu was actually Acute Myloid Leukemia - blood cancer.

She was subsequently rushed into chemotherapy and has been sick in hospital since.

So when her 14-year-old son, William, called the phone in her room at the weekend, it was a case of great timing.

Behind the snowy rooftop message that's been cheering up patients at a Chicago hospital is an incredibly sweet son who wanted to make his sick mother smile

Sweet kid: William Hart explains in a TV interview how he and his father used their feet to scrawl the huge message in the freshly-fallen snow

Frightening: Sharon Hart thought she was sick with the stomach flu, however it turned out to be cancer. Although her life has since been turned upside down, the love of her family is getting her through it

'He said come come to the window, he was so excited,' Hart told WGN.

'I pulled up the window and it said 'Hi mom' with a smiley face and all.'

Will and his father, Gary, were on their way inside Rush University Medical at the time when they drove to the roof to see the view of Chicago's skyline.

What they found was an opportunity in the freshly-fallen snow.

'I just kind of thought, 'You know, it would be great to have my mom see this message.,' William told ABC Local.

'And so I started from there, and my dad was like, 'What are you doing?' And he joined in. I said, 'I'm saying hi to mom,' and we went on from there. '

Hannah Hart, William's older sister, said she can't believe how much attention the message - which went viral almost immediately - has received

William Hart has always been incredibly close with his mother, Sharon, who is now battling blood cancer

However, when the two left the hospital around 10pm that night, they could the faces of many patients looking down at them, and decided the gesture wasn't big enough.

'Dad had the idea to write Gold Bless You All,' said Hannah Hart, Will's older sister.

'But it couldn't fit, so it says God Bless You, but it's still something everybody could see.'

It was a message that touched the hospital from top to bottom - literally.

'One of the other family members here said they had had goose bumps and that night went to bed crying about how special that was,' hospital nurse Maura Hoyt said.

All gone: Sadly the carpark had to be plowed on Monday morning to make more space for parking, however apparently the plowers were reluctant to sweep away the message

'It shows she raised an incredible young man and there is so much love in that family.'

Sadly the message was plowed away on Monday morning, with the hospital needed the rooftop for parking, however the image, which was Tweeted by a hospital staffer, had already gone viral.

Sharon Hart has since become known as 'The Mom' at Rush University Medical Center.
