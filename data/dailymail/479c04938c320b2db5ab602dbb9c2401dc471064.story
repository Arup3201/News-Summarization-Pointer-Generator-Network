A LONG (long) time ago, in a seaside town not too far away, there sat a rickety old pier.

On the outside, there was nothing remarkable about the landmark in Southwold. Just another decaying British icon being swallowed up by the sea. However, on the inside, there sat a champion.

Volley good show! There are simply bucket-loads of events to play through

An arcade game of such brilliance that only the finest competitors would insert 20p.

Names like 'ACE', 'AAA', 'ABC'... and 'ASS' topped the leaderboards with pride - flashing away at passersby, daring them to step up to the single joystick and three red buttons.

Many would walk on by and sit in the Star Wars game pretending to be Luke Skywalker. Not this gamer.

I spent most, if not all, of my summer holidays to Southwold trying to break records and be crowned a champion on Track & Field.

It was button-mashing genius which required great timing, even better angles and game-hardened finger and thumb tips. It was a hop, skip and jump ahead of anything else.

This was over 25 years ago. Since then, most athletics games have failed to even get close to the magic of Track & Field.

They’ve huffed and puffed their way onto our consoles in a bid to make money off the back of a big event.

So, is London 2012 - The Official Video Game of the Olympic Games one of these titles that have forgotten their roots? Yes and no.

Because although there are plenty of flaws to this game, there is a sense of a genuine attempt by developer SEGA Australia to make a good athletics title.

I'm the champ! Beating your mates never gets boring

One that understands that button mashing is an athletic talent, one that takes years of training and blisters in the strive for Olympic greatness.

Firstly, there are plenty of events to keep you busy. Track and Field sees you taking on 100m, 200m, 400m and 110m hurdles.

There is also javelin, shot-put, long jump, triple jump and high jump. Away from the obvious, you can also try some diving, swimming, canoeing, shooting and er, trampolining.

Visually, the game is a success and the stadiums and arenas really do give you a sense of what it will be like for athletes competing there.

So does the gameplay deserve a medal? Well, maybe. And it would probably only be a bronze.

The sprinting, for example, is fairly simply. Press A to start and then strike a fine balance on the sprint meter between yellow and red.

This involves a precise button mashing that keeps you in the green zone - the longer you’re there, the faster you go.

The same can be said for the 400m, but this time you have a stamina gauge - use it all up on the first bend and your athlete will be exhausted for the rest of the race.

The idea is fantastically old-school, but the execution is a little flaky.

On the long jump, for example, you have to flick the analogue stick a perfect 45 degrees - but the sweet spot is too fine to get close to on a regular basis which puts you off after a few attempts.

It's button-mashing time: You will need strong fingers and thumbs to master this

The high jump also suffers from inconsistencies - sometimes the AI will flick your feet when you ask it, other times it just ignores you.

The swimming isn’t bad. Depending on what stroke you’re attempting there are different controls you need plus hitting the correct button at the right time for a powerful tumble-turn.

But again, the smallest mistake means you lose all control of the stroke and have to build up your momentum again.

The commentary is a pain, too. The same voices say the same thing and often the comments don’t correlate to the action.

I had one chap saying: 'It’s good..it looks good..that is a fantastic jump!' Sadly, my mis-timed run-up left me jumping too early and just about making a jump into the sand.

Despite these gripes, you still get immense satisfaction when you pull off a fantastic javelin throw, or pip someone over the finish line to take the Gold and a new World Record.

You can line-up a range of events and customise them like a playlist, which is a nice touch. Or you can take part in the Games themselves.

Multiplayer is the best way to approach this game, especially if you have competitive friends.

Looking ace: The Olympics game even serves up some table tennis action

However, the Kinect aspect is a spectacular (Fosbury) flop. It’s clearly just a rushed extra that’s been bolted on for looks.

As well as a change in commentary (from the English team you suddenly get an excited American), it turns into an ugly 'party' game.

The controls are sloppy and unresponsive - and by the time you’ve rearranged your lounge to fit into the 'playing area', you’re too knackered to pretend to throw a javelin.

This is an okay game and it’s one you might go back to now and again.But you won’t go back to every summer.

Oh, and keep an eye out for your high scores - they will be compared with other gamers around the world.

It’s pretty depressing, though. Although I hurled the javelin to a new PB of 90.12m … I’m later told that some other player has gone over 105m. Cheats, I say - using some kind of cyber steroids.

I didn’t catch the names. Could well have been 'AAA', 'ACE' or 'ABC'...

Vibrant, colourful graphics help bring the athletes and stadiums to life

Kinect, however, does not work well and feels like an added extra

Some events are not that enjoyable, and commentary can grate after a while
