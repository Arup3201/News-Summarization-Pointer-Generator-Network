A teenage boy who bears a striking resemblance to actor Benedict Cumberbatch has been inundated with messages from women around the world.

Tyler Michell, 16, has more than 16,000 followers of followers on Instagram and often gets over 4,000 comments on his Cumberbatch-themed selfies.

Over the past few months the teen has gone from an ordinary boy to a pin-up for girls from as far away as Russia and the Philippines after people noticed he was a dead ringer for the Sherlock star.

Even closer to home he gets stopped in the street in his hometown of Norwich and quizzed on 'his' latest movies.

And after the real star lost out on the Best Actor gong for The Imitation Game, Tyler often has strangers offering him comfort over missing out on the Oscar to Eddie Redmayne.

Tyler said: 'It started out as a joke - my close friends and family would tease me and say I looked like Benedict Cumberbatch.

Tyler is often confused for the Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch (pictured) who was recently nominated for an Oscar for his role as Alan Turing in The Imitation Game

'I guess I look like him a little - but I really didn't take it seriously. Then people would come up to me at school and say 'Wow you really look like Sherlock.'

'Suddenly people started adding me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and I got more and more friends and followers.

'I get girls from Brazil saying the want to meet me in the UK which is crazy as I'm just a teenage boy sitting at home.

'Now people are messaging me and saying I should have won the Oscar. 

'I was shocked Benedict didn't win. This might be biased but I thought he was the best nomination.

'Even though he lost, it hasn't stopped the attention I get. I still get inundated with people messaging me on social media saying I look like him or that they love my work.'

Despite all the attention, Tyler insists he cannot see the resemblance between himself and the A lister.

'In honesty I don't really see the similarity,' he added. 'I'm a huge fan of Benedict, but I don't think I look like him.'

Accommodating Tyler tells fans who stop him he's not Oscar flop Cumberbatch, but happily offers them his signature instead.

'A couple of people have suggested me being a 'Teenlock' - a young version of the detective. I'd love that but I don't think it will happen,' he added.

Mum Nicola Alderton said: 'When one of his friends pointed it out we were gobsmacked.

'It could be quite surreal having a Hollywood superstar lookalike in the house, but he's just our Tyler,' she added.
