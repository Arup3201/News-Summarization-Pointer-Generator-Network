Snared: Wayne Corkhill, 23, was caught by a father posing as his 10-year-old daughter on Facebook

A concerned father posed as his own 10-year-old daughter online to snare a paedophile, a court heard.

Cyber predator Wayne Corkhill used Facebook to try and befriend the child and invited her round to his flat for 'cuddles,' telling her she was gorgeous.

Unknown to the  23-year-old he was not talking to the little girl, but was actually messaging her father.

When the father contacted police, Corkhill who was already on bail waiting to be sentenced for a string of sex offences, claimed his computer had been hacked. 

He was handed an extended prison sentence of six years and seven months by a judge at Preston Crown Court.

Corkhill had admitted five charges of sexual activity with a child, plus two of meeting a child following sexual grooming and one of attempting to meet a child following grooming.

Judge Robert Altham was told that the most recent offences took place in June, the same month he pleaded guilty. 

Sue Carter, prosecuting, said his behaviour with the 13-year-old began with kissing and progressed to touching.

He pleaded guilty to the offences, which occurred last year, and was on bail awaiting sentencing when he met up with two girls, aged 11 and 12.

Corkhill, from Blackpool, Lancashire., was smoking and he walked with them towards the chip shop where he worked.

He met up with them a second time near Central Pier, where he is said to have hugged them both.

The court heard he then touched the leg of one of the girls.

He contacted one of them online to say that she and her friend should go to his house and have sex, said Miss Carter.

Around this time, he made contact with the ten-year-old on Facebook, prompting the girl's dad to exchange messages with Corkhill while pretending to be his daughter.

Miss Carter said: 'He made it clear she was ten.

'The defendant said she was gorgeous and asked her to go to his flat for cuddles and gave her his telephone number.'

He went on to claim to police that his Facebook account must have been hacked into.

Waheed Omran-Baber, defending, said the girls had suffered pain, hurt and anxiety.

He said: 'There was a degree of naively and immaturity in his actions.

'There were, however, no threats, violence or intimidation by him.

'The defendant accepts what he has done is wrong. He expresses remorse.'

Judge Robert Altham told the defendant he had clearly had the most serious sexual interest towards girls and said an extended sentence was necessary for the protection of the public.

He added: 'I have no doubt that had he been left to his own devices these girls would have suffered extremely serious harm at his hands.'

Corkhill will be on the sex offenders register for life.

A sexual offences prevention order will apply indefinitely.

He will serve half his term behind bars before being released on extended licence for eight years.
