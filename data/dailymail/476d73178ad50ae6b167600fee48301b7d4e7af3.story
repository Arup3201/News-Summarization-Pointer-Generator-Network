Fighting back: Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski has accused Britain of stigmatising Poles who send child benefit home

Poland's foreign minister has lambasted David Cameron for saying European migrants should be banned from sending their child benefits back home.

Radoslaw Sikorski accused the Prime Minister of ‘stigmatising’ Poles by singling out the nation’s migrant workers in comments about his proposals to reform EU welfare rules.

Mr Sikorski said: ‘If Britain gets our taxpayers, shouldn’t it also pay their benefits? Why should Polish taxpayers subsidise British taxpayers’ children?’

Mr Cameron had said it was ‘wrong’ child benefit is paid to support workers’ families who remain in their home countries.

Under EU rules, child benefit has to 
be paid to European nationals who are working in Britain and paying 
National Insurance – even if their families are based abroad.

There are around 24,000 families claiming for 40,000 children, with two-thirds of the children based in Poland.

Speaking to BBC1's Andrew Marr show, Mr Cameron said: ‘I don’t think that is right and that is something I want to change.’

He warned stopping the export of benefits across the EU would ‘take time’ because a deal would need to be struck with other member states or wait for the new treaty he hopes to negotiate if he is still Prime Minister after the next election.

He said: ‘There are other European countries who like me think it’s wrong that someone from Poland who comes here, who works hard - and I am absolutely all in favour of that - but I don’t think we should be paying child benefit to their family back at home in Poland.

Attack: Mr Sikorski used Twitter to hit back at David Cameron's idea

‘Now, to change that, you’ve either 
got to change it with other European countries at the moment, or 
potentially change it through the treaty change that I’ll be putting in 
place before the referendum we will hold on Britain’s membership of the 
EU by the end of 2017.’

But today Mr Sikorski hit back, 
writing on Twitter: 'If Britain gets our taxpayers, shouldn't it also 
pay their benefits? Why should Polish taxpayers subsidise British 
taxpayers' children?’

He 
added: ‘UK social security rules apply to all resident EU citizens. No 
need to stigmatise Poles. What about British children abroad?’

Mr
 Cameron made clear that stopping migrant workers in the UK from 
claiming child benefit for their offspring back home would be a key 
demand of his plans to renegotiate a fresh deal with the EU before 
staging an in-out referendum by 2017.

Child benefit is paid at £20.30 a week for the first child and £13.40 for every other child.

Since
 last year families in the UK with one person earning more than £50,000 
have had their child benefit cut, and removed altogether if one earner 
has a salary of more than £60,000.

Mr Cameron said that tackling immigration from Europe would also be a key demand of renegotiation talks.

‘My
 job is to put in place proper controls so people can’t come here to 
claim benefits; to put in proper controls to investigate that people 
aren’t being paid less than the minimum wage; to make sure we deal with 
illegal immigrants; to make sure if people can’t sustain themselves, 
they are removed from our country. All those steps we’ll be taking.’ 

He said he wanted to change Britain’s relationship with the EU before putting it to a vote in an in-out referendum.

He refused to say if he would campaign
 to leave the EU if he failed to secure enough concessions, insisting 
his renegotiation was ‘doable’.

‘We
 need flexibility, we need more competitiveness, we need less costs 
added to our small business, we need to fix all these things.’
