Robbie Keane's mishit the ball twice during the build-up to LA Galaxy's second goal in their win against Vancouver.

The LA Galaxy striker pushed the ball with his right foot after receiving a neat backheel from Marcelo Sarvas in the build-up to the double mishit, before he tried to hammer the ball towards the far post. 

In the process he inadvertently put  Sarvas through on goal, who was not expecting the return ball but he made no mistake with the finish.

Double down: Sarvas scores a bizarre goal for LA Galaxy and celebrates by putting the ball underneath his shirt

The Brazilian midfielder slotted the ball underneath goalkeeper David Ousted inside the far post. 

Sarvas celebrated the goal by the sticking the ball underneath his shirt, to express his delight at the news that his wife, Camila, is pregnant with their second child.

Keane assisted both goals in the 2-0 win, the first one was a fully intended half-volley to Landon Donovan who dispatched the ball home.

He said: 'You're always taught that as a kid, to hit it across the goal, and most of the time someone's going to be there. If they're not there, then it's no problem.'

'The second one, I did [mishit it], definitely,' the LA Galaxy captain said, laughing. 'It was a complete mishit, but I'll take the assist.'
