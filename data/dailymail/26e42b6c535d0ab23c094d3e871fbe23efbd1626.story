President Barack Obama and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will renew there 'special relationship' next week when the pair meet to give the Jersey Shore a boost with a post-Memorial Day visit to showcase recovery efforts in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy.

The White House says the president will tour the coastline with Gov. Christie on Tuesday and speak about the need to expand economic opportunities for middle-class families hit by the storm. He also plans to meet with business and home owners who have benefited from the recovery.

Obama and Christie were a picture of bipartisanship after Sandy hit in October. Gov. Christie's favorable words and photo opportunities helped give the Obama a useful boost just before last year's presidential election and lost Christie some friends amongst his fellow Republicans.

He kept up his praise of the president last month when he said Obama 'has kept every promise he's made' 
about helping the state recover from Superstorm Sandy.

The
 federal government has spent $1.3 billion to assist families directly 
victimized by the storm. The government has set aside more than $1 
billion to help rebuilding efforts in states and $5.4 billion to help 
longer-term recovery efforts in the affected states.

Christie also said he 
had no regrets about deciding to reach out to the President for help.

'I think he's done a good job. He 
kept his word,' Christie said on April 29 which marked the six-month 
anniversary of Hurricane Sandy.

Speaking on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' program on the six-month anniversary of the deadly storm, the Republican governor said presidential politics had been the last thing on his mind when he toured storm-devastated areas with Obama last fall.

Comforter-in-chief: Christie said Obama's support for the region did not end with the October 31 photo op, but he 'kept every promise' that was made about recovery funding

Christie's warm embrace of Obama after the storm angered some Republicans, who said it helped tip the presidential election to the Democrat and away from Mitt Romney, who Christie endorsed and for whom he campaigned last fall.

Christie says he and Obama have fundamentally different views on governing, but he argues that the two men did what needed to be done for a devastated region.

'I've got a job to do,' he said.

'You wake up and 7 million of your 8.8 million citizens are out of power, you're not thinking about presidential politics.'

Christie challenged his critics to put themselves in his shoes while dealing with the massive storm, predicting none of them would have done anything differently.

'I have a 95 per cent level of disagreement with Barack Obama,' Christie said.

But that did not come into play while dealing with the storm.

'We saw suffering together,' Christie said.

Gov. Christie has already shown Britain's Prince Harry along the new boardwalk in Seaside Heights during a tour of areas of Ocean County that suffered extensive damage during Sandy

Surveying what survived: Christie came under fire from Republicans who criticized the Governor for speaking so highly about the President just days before the election, but Christie brushed off the criticism

'Everything the president promised me they'd do, they've done. I don't have any complaint this morning on the issue of disaster relief.'

Sandy destroyed about 360,000 homes or apartment units in New Jersey, and some areas along the shore are still devastated.

Congress approved more than $60billion in Sandy relief funds, most of it for New Jersey and New York, despite opposition from many Congressional Republicans who wanted to spend less.

'We've made a lot of progress in six 
months; I know we still have a long way to go,'Â  Christie said at a 
recent town hall meeting.

'By
 Memorial Day, every boardwalk that was destroyed at the Jersey shore 
will be rebuilt. Businesses are reopening. Rentals are picking up again,
 roads are back open.'

Christie estimated 39,000 New Jersey families remain displaced, down from 161,000 the day after the storm.

What needs to be done: There are still people in New York and New Jersey who are living in hotel rooms because their homes remain damaged
