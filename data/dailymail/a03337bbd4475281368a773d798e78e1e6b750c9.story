Displacing Daniel Sturridge up front for England is not something Danny Welbeck is thinking about ahead of the European Championship qualifier in Estonia. 

A thigh injury suffered on Three Lions duty last month has ruled Sturridge out of Liverpool's last seven matches, as well as this week's Euro 2016 qualifiers.

The 25-year-old's setback also meant he had to be replaced in the starting line-up to face Switzerland, giving Welbeck a rare chance as striker from the outset.

It was an opportunity he grasped, after scoring twice to secure a 2-0 win in Basle before netting four goals for new club Arsenal, as well as a close-range strike in the 5-0 defeat of San Marino on Thursday.

Welbeck is likely to get another start up front in Estonia, but the chance to put himself above Sturridge in the pecking order is not something he is thinking about.

'No, because I have been in squads with Daniel Sturridge before and we have played in different positions,' he said.

'There is me, Daniel, Wayne [Rooney] and Raheem [Sterling] as well and all the other forward players, so you can't just say this is the opportunity to make my mark.

'Whoever is in the squad I am going to try my best in every single game and training.

'Playing as a centre forward and getting into those goal-scoring opportunities it becomes much easier.'

England had to remain patient to find their way through the defence-minded San Marinese and are likely to have to do the same in Tallinn on Sunday.

'It's a quick turnaround,' Welbeck said of the Estonia trip. 'We have to travel out there and recover well as a team.

'We need to be prepared physically, mentally and tactically for the game.

'It's not going to be similar to San Marino and being away from home Estonia are going to try and win the game, but so are we.'
