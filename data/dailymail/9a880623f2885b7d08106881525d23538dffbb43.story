Mark Yeeles was jailed for six years at Newcastle Crown Court 

An internet blackmailer forced a teenage girl to perform an eight hour rape reenactment with her friend over webcam, threatening to send her family naked photographs of her if she refused.

Mark Yeeles was jailed for six years for preying on the victims who have been left in need of psychiatric care.

The 20-year-old from South Shields was told he had 'ruined their lives' as he was jailed for the sickening incident.

Newcastle Crown Court heard how Yeeles threatened 'your family are going to love a naked picture or two' when the girl tried to ignore his requests.

The teenager was on the brink of suicide when he ordered her to carry out the eight-our rape re-enactment online.

He admitted blackmail, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and possessing indecent images.

Judge Guy Whitburn said the man had 'ruined' the girls' lives.

'It is quite clear you were reminding her from time to time of the power you held over her to post naked pictures of her where her friends and family would see them.

'It is clear she knew she was being blackmailed.

'It was well thought out, it was deliberate and utterly heartless.'

'These girls who are particularly vulnerable, very young, they have to be protected from the consequences of their own folly.'

The court heard Yeeles approached his young victim over the internet after coming across a photograph of her in her underwear.

He used the image to threaten her into taping sordid videos, promising to delete them all once she had done what he told her.

When he told her to involve a friend, he instructed: 'convince her, for your sake'.

Prosecuting Gavin Doig said: 'The defendant manipulated her, promising he would leave her alone if she complied then failed to do so.

'They both performed for Yeeles, he was instructing them what to do.

'He was continuing to threaten to publish images if not satisfied with their performance.'

Afterwards, he sent one of the girls a photograph of the event, but did not make other contact for around a year.

When he resurfaced they called the police.

Vic Laffey, defending, said: 'He would not say boo to a goose but under the cover of the internet he was able to present himself as something he simply isn’t.

'There is no doubt he feels genuine remorse.

'He didn’t realise the torment he was putting people through but he does now.'
