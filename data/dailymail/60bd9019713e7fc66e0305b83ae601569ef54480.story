'Elfie': Elephant Latabe touched the iPhone screen with her trunk - and taken a picture of herself

This is the moment an elephant at a wildlife park used an iPhone to take the world's first ‘elfie’.

Visitor Scott Brierley, 23, had been traveling in the West Midlands Safari Park’s drive-through elephant zone in Bewdley, Worcestershire, taking pictures of the African animals.

But as Mr Brierley, of Birmingham, took one photograph on Bank Holiday Monday he dropped his mobile phone and the keepers ordered him to stay in his car and keep moving.

Staff later retrieved his iPhone and Mr Brierley was stunned to see 22-year-old elephant Latabe had touched the screen with her trunk - and taken a picture of herself.

The events manager said he has now got the world's only elephant selfie, adding: ‘I live quite close to the park so I've been there a few times. The elephants are my favourite along with tigers.

‘Me and a friend were driving past the elephant enclosure, I took a few pics of me with one of the elephants. But when I turned back around I hit my phone on the side of the car door.

‘It fell down onto the grass. The elephant was all over it - I think he thought it was food. I didn't dare get out the car to get it. I just drove to one of the workers I could see and he went to get it.

‘I really couldn't believe when the iPhone came back, I pressed the centre button to check it was still working and “wow”, there it was. Me and my friend were in shock.

‘The elephant had taken two pictures, but the second isn't very good. I have shown everybody the elephant selfie, and they all love it.’

'What a picture - we're very proud of Latabe'

Andy Plumb, head keeper

Head keeper Andy Plumb said: ‘I saw the young man drop the phone, I waved him on. He started to drive towards us so I went to retrieve it.

‘Lots of people have dropped their phones at our park but I've never seen anything like this. What a picture - we're very proud of Latabe.’

The 200-acre West Midlands Safari Park was opened in April 1973 and admission is £18 for adults.
