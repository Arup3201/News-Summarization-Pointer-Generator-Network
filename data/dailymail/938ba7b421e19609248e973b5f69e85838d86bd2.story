Mario Balotelli's hopes of transforming his Liverpool career have suffered another blow after Brendan Rodgers warned he must get used to being a substitute.

The Italy striker is available for the game at Burnley after serving a one-match suspension but Liverpool’s manager has no intentions of handing Balotelli an immediate recall.

Liverpool’s performances have improved recently since Rodgers reverted to a 3-4-3 formation and the manager says Balotelli does not have the traits to play that role.

It is the latest sign that Balotelli’s career at Anfield is doomed to failure and Rodgers would not provide any assurances to the 24-year-old that he will be starting any time soon.

When asked how Balotelli would deal with being a substitute, Rodgers said: ‘It’s something he would have to. If the team is going to need him from the bench, then it’s something he would have to become adjusted to.

‘It’s the same for every single player, not just him. When called upon — whether it’s to start a game or come off the bench — you ask your players to be ready.’

Balotelli has not scored in the Barclays Premier League since joining Liverpool in a £16million deal in August and, due to a combination of injuries and suspension, he has only played 124 minutes since November 8. His manager feels he does not have the attributes to thrive in the style Liverpool play.

Rodgers  added: ‘We have seen it’s not really his game (to press defenders and run). Working with him for the period of time he’s been here, we have seen that he’s probably someone who’s better in and around the box.

‘So that level of intensity and pressing isn’t part of his game. But you try to get the best out of the players you have and the qualities they have.

‘That’s something we will focus on. The most important thing is that he is now available and adds another player to this squad.’
