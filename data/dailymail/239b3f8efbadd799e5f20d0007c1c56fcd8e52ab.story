A pregnant teenager was allegedly groped by a 38-year-old paramedic in an ambulance last month.

Joseph Hartsfield, who works for the Memphis Fire Department, allegedly groped a 17-year-old girl traveling to St. Francis Hospital, MyFoxMemphis reported.

In the girl's account to authorities, she said she was groped by Hartsfield during the trip, and that the paramedic posed sexual questions as well as behaved in a 'creepy' manner, according to the affiliate station.

Paramedic: Joseph Hartsfield, pictured, allegedly groped a pregnant 17-year-old's breast in an ambulance

MyFoxMemphis reported that the girl spoke to a St. Francis nurse, and that both police and fire departments were contacted by the hospital.

An affidavit, excerpts of which were published by WREG, said the 17-year-old claimed Hartsfield posed questions 'of a sexual nature' on January 8.

Hartsfield allegedly felt one of the girl's breasts and 'lifted her breast and felt under her breast,' the affidavit said of the girl's account.

It continued, 'The victim stated the Defendant was acting "creepy".'

WREG reported that Hartsfield did not face charges over an allegation of 'forcible fondling' last year.

Lt. Wayne Cooke, a fire department representative, told The Commerical Appeal 'After he is released, the administration will determine his job status.'

Cooke told the newspaper Hartsfield has been a MFD employee since October 2008.

An inmate information page from the Shelby County Sheriff's Office says Hartsfield has been charged with two sexual battery charges, with his bond set at $5,000.

The MFD did not immediately return a Daily Mail Online request for comment.
