Brazil are hosting this World Cup and are the overwhelming favourites to lift the trophy on July 13. But there are plenty of countries out to stop them.

Here, Sportsmail's experts predict who will win the tournament, who will be the best player... and how far England will progress.

Who will win and why?

Brazil — Home advantage counts for a lot. They were impressive when they won the Confederations Cup — and good early results will get the nation behind them.

How far will England go?

The quarter-finals. They will negotiate their group and the potential last-16 opponents don’t look too problematic either.

Who will be the superstar?

Marco Reus  — Has been outstanding for Dortmund. Reus is their best player and it’s time for him to show it on the world stage.

Will we see these scenes again? Brazil won the Confederations Cup last year and are favourites to lift the World Cup on home soil with the whole nation behind them

Who will win and why?

This will be one of the most tightly contested World Cups ever. Spain’s era of tiki-taka could be at an end and with home advantage, I think Brazil will do it.

How far will England go?

England are better than people think. If we give it a go there’s no reason why we can’t get to the last eight.

Who will be the superstar?

This tournament needs a superstar and Lionel Messi could be it. This is his chance to confirm he is still world football’s No 1 player.

Superstar: This World Cup is Lionel Messi's chance to show he's still the best footballer on the planet

Who will win and why?

Brazil. It will be such an emotional tournament — when the anthem begins the tears start. It’s an invisible force that powers the team.

How far will England go?

A quarter-final is achievable. Get out of the group and they have no one to fear in the last-16.

Who will be the superstar?

Neymar is Brazil’s star. Every kid in the country will want a No 10 shirt with his name on the back.

Who will win and why?

Argentina. An easy group, a straightforward route to the semis, and a team oozing with talent. Did I mention Messi?

How far will England go?

I fear it will be a struggle to escape the group. If they finish second, should at least get to the quarters.

Who will be the superstar?

I think Jose Mourinho might be right about his Brazilian Oscar. I can see him peaking this summer.

Who will win and why?

Argentina. A gentle draw, no games in the heat, close to home and a great squad.

How far will England go?

Last eight. Group D is tough but it can inspire England. There is a fresh feel, a balance and a happy vibe.

Who will be the superstar?

Messi. After a subdued season, by his own high standards, it is time for Messi to leave his World Cup legacy.

Fresh feel: Ross Barkley has added to the happy vibe around England ahead of the tournament

Who will win and why?

Brazil. Because Luiz Felipe Scolari knows how to do the job. Being at home will be an advantage rather than a burden.

How far will England go?

Last 16. A significantly better squad than South Africa and a progression from Euro 2012.

Who will be the superstar?

Marco Reus. Germany will go close again and Reus will be at the heart of their high-energy football.

Who will win and why?

Argentina. They combine phenomenal attacking power and like the conditions.

How far will England go?

The last 16 because we are not as bad as some people think and not as good as some people hope.

Who will be the superstar?

Sergio Aguero. Didn’t play as many games as some during Premier League season so is fresh.

Fresh: Sergio Aguero did not play as many Premier League games as he'd have wanted but that could help him

Who will win and why?  

Brazil are a different team when the players put on the national shirt and will be too strong.

How far will England go?

Heart says the final, head says they will do well to get to the quarter-final.

Who will be the superstar?

Neymar. With Brazil he doesn’t have to play second fiddle to Messi. Everything is built around him.

Focal point: Brazil build everything around Neymar and he could have a defining tournament

Who will win and why?  

Brazil. Big Phil Scolari knows World Cups, Neymar’s growing up. The Beautiful Game is coming home.

How far will England go?

Unless they founder in the group, we are heading for familiar territory with England. The quarter-final club.

Who will be the superstar?

For the legend of Messi to be cemented this wonderfully gifted little man needs to dominate a World Cup like Pele or Maradona.

The example: Messi needs to dominate a World Cup just as Diego Maradona did in 1986
