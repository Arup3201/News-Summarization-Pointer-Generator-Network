Surgery to restore function in women's clitorises is becoming increasingly common to help those who have suffered female genital mutilation.

The procedure offers hope women who have had their clitorises circumcised, and who suffer painful side effects and a loss of sexual pleasure as a result

Surgeons carrying out the procedure say the operation could stop  pain, help women feel sexual pleasure and restore their identity and femininity.

Worldwide, the UN estimates that over 133 million women have been subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM).

While surgeons in the US, France, Canada and various countries in Africa offer the operation, last month a Swedish surgeon successfully reconstructed a clitoris for the first time. 

The procedure can be performed because the clitoris is much larger than most people assume, Dr Hannes Sigurjónsson, the surgeon who performed the operation, told VICE.

‘The clitoris isn't completely removed during a genital mutilation operation – only the part that is visible,’ Dr Sigurjónsson, of Karolinska University Hospital in Solna, Sweden told VICE journalist Rasmus Elfton.

‘So the point of my method is to carefully remove scar tissue and reveal the part of the clitoris that's still there, mobilise it forward and put it in its place.’

The clitoris has a 10cm long root that arches around the vagina, and when FGM is carried out, only the visible part of the clitoris is cut off.

This means surgeons are able to remove the scar tissue, pull the remaining parts of clitoris – which also feels sensation - to the front of the vagina to rebuild a working organ.

In some cases, the perpetrators have performed a procedure called infibulation, Dr Sigurjónsson said.

This is where the clitoris is removed and the labia are stitched together to form a cover over the vagina. A small hole is left for urine, menstruation, childbirth and intercourse.

Therefore surgeons must first surgically open the vaginal orifice, Dr Sigurjónsson said.

While he cannot ever fully restore the genitalia to how they would have been before the woman was mutilated, plenty of parts in the genital area can be re-created, he said.

He continued: ‘We can open the vagina up again and we can recreate the clitoris and the clitoris hood.

The clitoris isn't completely removed during a genital mutilation operation – only the part that is visible.

It is much longer than most people assume, beyond the visible tip, there is a 10cm long root that arches around the vagina beneath the surface.

This means in order to reconstruct the clitoris, surgeons remove the the scar tissue and pull the remaining parts of clitoris to the front of the vagina, stitching it up.

As the whole clitoris feels sensation - not just the tip - they are able to rebuild a working organ.

‘We can also in some cases recreate the labia minora (the inner ‘lips’ of the vagina).’

‘The method is being developed and is getting better with time, research and experience.

‘But it will always be hard to restore someone's mutilated genitals 100 per cent.’

He added that clitoral reconstruction is not just about the physical repair of the genitalia, the psychological aspect is just as vital.

He said: ‘The most important thing when treating women and girls who have been victims of female genital mutilation is for plastic surgeons, gynaecologists, sexologists and psychotherapists to work together.

‘It is only with a multidisciplinary approach that these women can see improvement in their quality of life and experience less pain.’

Dr Marci Bowes, a U.S. surgeon who has carried out hundreds of procedures since 2009, said the number one reason women undergo the operation is to restore their identity.

‘Women who have been cut feel their sense of womanhood has been stolen from them and they want that back,’ she told Washington Post journalists.

‘They want their body back and to feel more normal. It’s about not being different any more.’

The most common side effects of the procedure, according to the available research, are bleeding and infections, which affect around three to five per cent of women.

Most of the women who undergo the procedure experience less pain and more sensation in their reconstructed clitoris after the surgery.

Surgeons say the surgery can prevent pain, restore sexual function and the identity of women who have been subjected to female genital mutilation

But a minority, less than five per cent, feel less sensation afterwards – a risk Dr Sigurjónsson said he makes clear to all patients.

The technique to restore function in the clitoris was developed only a decade ago, pioneered by French urologist and surgeon Pierre Foldès.

Reconstructive surgery to repair the physical damage of FGM is not a new phenomenon, but the procedure is becoming more common as more women become aware of it.

The market for this surgery is less niche than one might assume, Dr Sigurjónsson said.

The Swedish Board of Health and Welfare estimates that 19,000 women in Sweden are in the risk zone of getting mutilated.

Dr Sigurjónsson said: ‘Worldwide, reliable sources such as the United Nations and Unicef report that over 133 million women have been subjects to female genital mutilation.

‘Three million young girls are mutilated every year. So the demand for this kind of surgery is huge.’
