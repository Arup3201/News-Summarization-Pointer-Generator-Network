The first portraits created from 3D scans of a sitting president are going on display at the Smithsonian.

Digital imaging specialists at the Smithsonian created a 3D printed bust and life mask of President Barack Obama this year. 

The portraits were first shown at the White House during a gathering of inventors, entrepreneurs and students.

First ever: A 3D printed bust of President Obama went on display at the Smithsonian Castle, along with life masks that were also printed in plastic

Life masks: The president's life mask, here with masks made of President Lincoln (left and center) and his bust are made out of thousands of layers of plastic melted together using lasers

The portraits went on display Tuesday at the Smithsonian Castle. They will be on view through December.

The president's face was scanned by experts from the University of Southern California's Institute for Creative Technologies. 

The photo shoot included 50 custom-built LED lights, eight sports photography cameras and six wide angle cameras to gather the data needed for the 3D image of President Obama. 

The Smithsonian team then used handheld 3-D scanners and traditional single-lens reflex cameras to record peripheral 3-D data to create an accurate bust.  

The bust was 3D printed using a laser to melt plastic together in 5,000 layers. It took 40 hours to print, and because it's plastic, the material will be durable over time, said image specialist Adam Metallo.

Scanners: The actual scanning took about 5 minutes. The result was a 3D scan of the president at a higher resolution that is currently possible to print in 3D

Lifelike masks are nothing new, of course, though the technology is. Plaster masks were created of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln's faces during their lives, and they are kept in the Smithsonian collection.

'We were really inspired by our experience with the Lincoln life masks,' said Gunter Waibel, director of the Smithsonian's digitization program.

The group has made 3D scans and prints to replicate the original Lincoln masks from early and late in the Civil War. They have proven especially popular with school groups using the Smithsonian's 3D scans.

'There's a very, very deep connection that gets made when you have accurate data of a person's face and that person was a part of history,' Waibel said. 'People really felt the Lincoln life masks deeply spoke to them and connected them to a place, a time, a life and ultimately a legacy of the 14th president.'

But past presidential masks were created through plaster casting that required a president to sit with plaster on his face, breathing through straws stuck in his nose. So the Smithsonian set out to update that process with 21st century technology to make it fast and easy.

The team proposed a scan of Obama in 2013, and the White House agreed. 

Obama joined them for about 15 minutes in the White House. The actual scanning took about 5 minutes. The result was a 3D scan of the president at a higher resolution that is currently possible to print in 3D.

'You can see down to the wrinkles in the skin and the pores on his face,' said Vince Rossi, a 3D imaging specialist.

For centuries, artists have used the latest technology to create imagery of leaders, whether it was busts chiseled out of marble, paintings or photographs.

'We think we've really added a new genre to portraiture,' Waibel said. 'It will be fascinating to see how that will be picked up and how down the line other administrations will also use that particular tool.' 

Ultra-realistic: The plastic material makes the portraits very durable and also ultra-realistic. The president's face was scanned and replicated down to the tiniest wrinkles
