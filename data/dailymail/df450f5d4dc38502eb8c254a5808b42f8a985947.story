Disgraced BBC presenter Stuart Hall had his prison sentence for a series of sex assaults on girls doubled yesterday.

Three Appeal Court judges ruled that his original 15-month term was ‘inadequate’ and should be increased to 30 months.

The former It’s A Knockout host, 83, was told that he will not be eligible for release until September next year.

Guilty: Hall had 'got away' with his crimes for years because of his celebrity status, judges said today

Jailed: Although Stuart Hall is currently serving time in prison, appeal judges ruled today that his sentence was 'unduly lenient'

'Unduly lenient': Attorney General Dominic 
Grieve (left) said the original 15-month sentence handed to Hall by Judge Anthony Russell 
QC (right) did not reflect the seriousness of his crimes

Hall, a married father-of-two, had admitted sexually assaulting 13 girls aged nine to 17 over nearly 20 years.

His
initial sentence handed down last month was heavily criticised by his  
victims, child protection campaigners and senior politicians.

After 
receiving numerous complaints, Attorney General Dominic Grieve  
concluded that the punishment was ‘unduly lenient’ and referred the case
to the Court of Appeal.

Yesterday, three judges led by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge, agreed that Hall should have been jailed for longer.

In
a withering judgment, they  condemned the paedophile’s original public 
denials of the sex allegations that had been made against him.

Increase: Hall was given a 15-month prison sentence at Preston Crown Court but this was doubled by Court of Appeal judges

Court appearances: The television presenter initially strongly denied the charges, before pleading guilty

As 
Hall watched glum-faced via a video link from Preston Prison, Lord Judge
said the court regarded his verbal attack on his victims as a 
‘seriously aggravating’ feature in the case.

Hall had initially dismissed their claims as ‘cruel,  pernicious and spurious’ in a  statement made on the steps of a court.

In
a lengthy ruling, Lord Judge said that Hall knew the truth and was 
fully alert to the possible advantages of manipulating the media.

At 
that point, hoping to escape justice and trying to use the media to 
possibly influence potential jurors, he  ‘traduced’ 13 women who had 
been assaulted by him.

Lord Judge said: ‘He did plead guilty but not before he had publicly and deliberately attacked the victims.’

Hall, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, who admitted 14 counts of indecent assault, showed no reaction to the doubling of his sentence.

Mugshot: Hall has been serving his time in HMP Preston where he shares a cell with another prisoner

He
had faced a maximum of five years in prison when first sentenced at 
Preston Crown Court by the Recorder of  Preston, Judge Anthony  Russell 
QC. But he was given a reduced term because of his guilty pleas.

Lord
Judge said Hall ‘got away with it’ for decades and had ‘lived a lie for
more than half of his life’. At the end of yesterday’s hearing, he 
concluded: ‘Making every allowance that can reasonably be made, this 
sentence was inadequate.

‘We have to record that the successful 
career hardly provides mitigation. On the contrary, it was the career 
that put him in a position of trust that he was then able to exploit.’

It
contributed to his image as a cheerful, fun-loving, ‘fundamentally 
decent man’. It also reinforced the view ‘that effectively he was 
untouchable’.

The judge said that, to his victims, Hall must have 
seemed a ‘figure of power and authority and influence’. After the ruling
in London, Mr Grieve said: ‘I hope this case has highlighted that 
historical sexual offences are always taken very seriously and shows 
that the law still applies, whoever the offender may be.’

Hall’s 
counsel, Crispin Aylett QC, said the original sentence was ‘entirely 
appropriate’. If it was merciful, that was because Hall pleaded guilty 
at an early stage, was 83 and his last offence was 27 years ago, he 
added.

The court’s ruling was welcomed by Alan Collins, from law firm
Pannone, which is  representing 17 women bringing compensation claims 
against Hall and the BBC.

He said: ‘It took into account Hall’s 
attitude to those women. It’s good the Court of Appeal saw that [the 
speech on the court steps] was an aggravating factor. It was terrible, 
he shouldn’t have done it.’

The Mail revealed this month that Hall 
has also tried to buy off his victims with as little as £2,000 to stop 
them seeking further compensation.

He preyed on 13 victims over 20 years, the youngest of whom was just nine.

Stuart Hall used his fame and influence at the BBC to win the trust of parents and their children.He attacked some at his home and others while on the broadcaster’s premises.

Fondled: Kim Wright is overjoyed at the stronger sentence

Hall’s youngest victim was assaulted under the sheets at her home while he read her a bedtime story.Another victim, aged just 13, was attacked in the bath when she attended a party at the home of one of Hall’s friends.

Others were attacked in his car, his dressing room or while filming the gameshow It’s a Knockout.

Last month two of the women who helped bring him to justice waived their right to anonymity to tell the Daily Mail of Hall’s abuse.

Kim Wright, who had her breasts fondled by Hall in Blackpool when she was 17, said she was ‘overjoyed’ by the decision to double his jail term.

Miss Wright, now 55, said: ‘I’m delighted. The original sentence was an absolute insult to his victims.I’m not a vindictive person, but justice has to be seen to be done. He was a paedophile and I wish people would call him that.

‘These little girls were unable to understand what was happening or protect themselves.’ Miss Wright was the first of Hall’s victims to make a formal complaint to police.

She said: ‘When he picked on me, he picked on the wrong person.

‘I was convinced I can’t have been the only one and I felt it my duty to report it, in case there was someone out there who daren’t. Someone who’d suffered more than me. I know I did the right thing, but I didn’t do it for me, it was for the other women.’

Susan Harrison said she was 16 when the presenter lured her to BBC studios in 1967 on the false pretext of helping her record a song.

Hall attacked her in his car while driving her home.

She said ‘I was so shocked and terrified. I couldn’t do anything as I had frozen. It went on for a couple of minutes.

‘I was scared and I just wanted it all to go away.’

Miss Harrison suffered with depression for years as a result of the abuse.

‘Every time I saw him on TV, I would turn it off,’ she said.

‘I absolutely couldn’t stand to see him smiling and joking.

‘He was standing there presenting this persona but he had ruined my life.’

One of the women allegedly assaulted by Stuart Hall today said she wants to meet him in person to challenge him about his 'despicable' behaviour.

The woman, known only as 'Jane', described Hall as 'a disgrace' and hit out at a BBC crew who she says looked the other way when she says she was attacked in the early 1980s aged 24.

She told BBC 5 Live: 'Stuart Hall has not shown any remorse whatsoever and I feel that he should be made to be accountable and he should be to be accountable face to face with any of the victims who would be willing to put him through that process.

'His modus operandi was to isolate the women who he chose to abuse. He chose to make them as vulnerable as they possibly could be and what I would like to see is that he is vulnerable in the face of his victims and made to answer questions such as what made him think he could behave in such a way.'

Jane was cornered by Hall, who was then in his 50s, outside a hotel while filming It's A Knockout abroad.

When she rejected his advances he first apologised, saying it was a 'one-off', before chasing her into a hotel and 'forceably' trying to get
into her room, she said.

'I was mostly repulsed, I thought he was absolutely despicable and a 
disgrace - I did feel he was using his position - somebody who was 
famous - to be predatory,' Jane said.

She is currently suing the BBC for what she says is a 'degree of culpability' in what happened.

But because the alleged assault took place overseas and the law at the time did not allow cases from another jurisdiction to be brought to British courts, the Crown Prosecution Service was unable to take the case any further.
