Victims of the most serious tidal surge in 60 years have been warned to avoid direct contact with floodwater and beware of rats moving into homes.

Thousands of people who were evacuated
from Britain's east coast will be assessing the 
damage after finally being allowed to return to their homes yesterday.

A major clean-up operation is under way after 1,400 homes were flooded, including 300 in Boston, Lincolnshire, alone, according to Environment Agency (EA) figures.

In Suffolk, police said there was no further threat from coastal flooding but local authorities warned that people should take precautions around floodwater.

These include preventing children from playing in flooded areas or with contaminated toys, discarding food grown in allotments or gardens and storing rubbish out of the reach of pests.

Improving weather last night saw floods recede in many areas, and the EA removed more than 200 flood warnings.

There were no severe flood warnings and just one flood warning in place as of 1pm.

Emergency services downgraded risk levels, and most of the people evacuated from their homes have left evacuation centres.

Picking up the pieces: Residents begin clearing away debris and damage after flood waters breached the Humber Estuary flood defence wall at South Ferriby. The Met Office says weather in the area will be much milder now

Those attempting to pick up the pieces after the inundation are in for some respite as far as weather is concerned. The Met Office told MailOnline that conditions in the area were likely to remain dry for the next couple of days.

'It's also much milder as we head through the next 12 to 24 hours,' a forecaster said. He said the country's weather would be characterised by 'something of a north-south divide' over the next few days.

The north-west of the UK, including Scotland and Northern Ireland, 'will be quite breezy and windy over the next few days,' he said. It will be wet, but nothing like the storms which have battered the East this week.

Further south, according to the Met Office, temperatures 'are generally in the double figures', although it will feel colder, and there will be patchy sunshine.

The forecaster went on: 'As we go through into Monday the rain will gradually start to ease over Scotland leaving most areas generally dry.'

We have seen the last of any frost for the next few days, he added, although the overnight chill could see some lasting fog in the mornings.

'For Tuesday it's a very similar kind of picture,' the forecaster said. 'We have got high pressure over the Continent. It's influence means we will get mild south-westerly winds.'

Cromer's devastated promenade: Improved flood defences were said to have stopped the largest North Sea surge since 1953 from causing even more chaos, protecting at least 800,000 homes

The break in the wintry weather couldn't come soon enough for inhabitants of Britain's east coast where this week a fierce storm in the North Sea caused widespread disruption and claimed two lives.

Record-breaking sea levels were recorded along the east coast through a combination of large waves and a tidal surge, the EA said.

The Thames Barrier, which had faced the biggest tide since it opened in 1982, reopened yesterday afternoon.

Improved flood defences were said to have stopped the largest North Sea surge since 1953 from causing even more chaos, protecting at least 800,000 homes.

But even with the protection some areas suffered severe damage.

EA teams are expected to inspect and repair damage to walls, banks and other defences over the coming days.

Devastated residents in Hemsby, Norfolk, watched their cliff-top homes disappear into the sea as the tidal surge hit on Thursday night.

Five bungalows fell into the water as the high tide eroded the cliff below, while dozens of residents formed a human chain to help salvage the possessions of those affected. A lifeboat station was also reportedly washed into the sea.

Meanwhile, about 250 seal pups are thought to be missing from a breeding ground in Horsey, Norfolk, following a second tidal surge yesterday afternoon.

Hundreds of people were evacuated in Boston, Lincolnshire, and Clacton-on-Sea in Essex, where many people living in the area around the town's railway station had to leave their homes or take shelter on upper floors as water swept through houses on Thursday.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said two women, two babies in pushchairs and a dog were rescued after being hit by a large wave at Louisa Bay in Broadstairs, Kent.

The two people who died on Thursday were lorry driver Robert Dellow, 54, from Lowestoft in Suffolk, whose vehicle overturned in West Lothian, Scotland, and an 83-year-old man who was hit by a falling tree in Retford, Nottinghamshire.

Dr Paul Leinster, chief executive of the EA, said: 'Our thoughts remain with those people who have been affected by flooding. People can find advice on how to recover from a flood on our website or by calling Floodline on 0845 988 1188.

'We continue to work with our partners to review the impact of flooding and to ensure that damage to flood walls and banks is repaired as soon as possible.

'Our staff, partners and the emergency services have worked tirelessly to issue warnings, ensure that flood risk management assets were in place and move people to safety. Without their efforts the impacts of this storm could have been far worse.

'Over the last three days we issued an unprecedented number of severe flood warnings. These early warnings gave emergency services, homes and businesses vital time to prepare.'
