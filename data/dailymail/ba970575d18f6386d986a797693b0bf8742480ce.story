Clubbers using the toilets had a nasty shock when they fell through to the cellar when the floor gave way from under them at a Salford nightclub.

Mark Cowgill, 29, and six others were using the gents when the floor collapsed and sent them crashing into the drinks cellar of Hell Polish Club in Eccles.

None of the seven men were injured when they fell, and ambulance crews, including those specially trained in hazardous area response, were speedily dispatched to the Church Road club shortly after 1.30am on March 15.

Clubbers fell through the floor after the toilet collapsed in a Salford nightclub, which miraculously didn't leave anyone injured

Greater Manchester Police attended the incident and a building control officer was called to secure the scene and investigate.

The council said that evidence of a water leak was found at the area of the collapse, which may have been the cause.

A spokeswoman for the North West Ambulance Service said four of the men were taken to Salford Royal with minor injuries.

It was described by one survivor as 'like something out of a film' as the floor creaked and gave way below him

The cause of the collapse is unclear, although examiners from the council believe it might be due to water leakages

A survey was recommended to assess the full extent of the damage, and the club remained open after the incident but it is not known whether or not it has been open since.

However, the council apparently has no power to force it to shut.

Cowgill said: 'I was just washing my hands when we heard a creak.

'Everyone sort of stopped and looked at each other and it just gave way.

All seven men using the toilet at the time collapse through the floor to the drinks cellar, although only four were sent to hospital and none were seriously injured

'It was quite surreal, it was like something out of a film to be honest.

'I ended up in a heap in the cellar.

'We were all in shock just looking at each other. It was frightening.'
