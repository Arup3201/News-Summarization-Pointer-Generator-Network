Theme park managers are taking the drastic measure of breath testing students, after too many have vomited on rollercoasters while drunk or hungover during the first week of university.

But far from turning them away, Thorpe Park staff are instead happily directing those who are over the limit to the most extreme rollercoaster - which hurtles them through the air head-first at up to 60mph.

It might sound like a harsh lesson, but research supported by the park has found the blast of fresh air on The Swarm is exactly what queasy guests need to settle their stomachs and avoid being sick.

Staff members will now be breathalysing students and directing those over the limit to adrenaline-boosting rides to cure their hangovers

Staff have seen a massive 250 per cent increase in the number of people being sick on rides this week, as new students arrive at university for the first time and get stuck in to the infamous alcohol-fueled freshers week.

The Surrey park, which is close to a number of universities,will breathalyse students to avoid an increase in ‘sick shutdowns’, on some of its most vomit-inducing rides and attractions.

Those who have more than 35mg of alcohol per 100ml of breath will then  be fast-tracked onto the park’s proven hangover-busting rides, and turned away from others until they are feeling perkier.

The move will hopefully appease families, who will no longer be forced to wait while  rides are closed during clean-up operations.

The Swarm sends riders shooting through the air head-first down a drop of 39m - but has been found to be the perfect solution to settling queasy stomachs

The research, carried out by neuropsychologist Dr David Lewis, foundthe  blast of oxygen on the high-speed Swarm improves drunk riders' metabolic rate, which boosts speeds at which toxins are broken down.

Mike Vallis, divisional director of Thorpe Park, said: ‘Thorpe Park does not condone drinking and riding, however, during this Fresher’s Week period, we realise that a number of our guests do not recognise that they are suffering from the effects of the night before.

‘We felt it was our duty to ensure that all of our guests enjoy the extreme nature of our rides and by putting them on The Swarm, which is proven to be the ultimate hangover cure.

‘We are confident our guests will have a great, and hopefully vomit-free, day.’

Thorpe Park hopes the move will end years of 'sick shutdowns', which force guests to wait while rides are cleaned of vomit
