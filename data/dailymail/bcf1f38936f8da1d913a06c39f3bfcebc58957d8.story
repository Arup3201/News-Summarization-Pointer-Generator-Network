All's well that ends well: Brian Saunders with his two-year-old spaniel Iso, who was rescued after falling down a 164ft mine shaft while chasing a cat

A spaniel that fell 164ft down a mine shaft while chasing a cat was finally found after a 24-hour search when his owner whistled into a microphone.

Two-year-old Iso tumbled 50m into the empty mine while out with his owner Brian Saunders.

Mr Saunders was playing a round of golf when the dog spotted a cat and ran into undergrowth at the course in Redruth, Cornwall.

Iso fell into a mine shaft, but 
apparently survived the fall after landing on garden waste 
thrown in by a local resident.

The
pooch is trained to return to a whistle and despite a frantic search he
could not be found and a distressed Brian returned home to Falmouth, 
Cornwall.

But the 
following morning he got a call from the owners of a house near the 
course who thought Iso might have fallen down a mine shaft in their 
garden.

Brian raced to the house to find a 'small army' of firefighters at work who asked him to whistle into a microphone.

The sound blared out from speakers lowered into the seam which echoed around the mineshaft.

Iso recognised his owner’s whistle and began barking which allowed rescuers to pull him out unscathed.

Mr Saunders said: 'They put a probe down the shaft and a chap with headphones asked me to whistle into a microphone.

'I whistled twice and nothing happened, and then after the third whistle, the chap said he could hear barking.'

Terrifying fall: The spaniel tumbled 50m into the empty mine while out with Mr Saunders on a golf course

It took the firefighters around an hour to set up their equipment before one of them abseiled to the bottom of the shaft.

Iso, who seemed none the worse for wear, was hauled to the surface and reunited with his owner.

Brian
said: 'Iso was jumping for joy when he saw me. He was jumping up and 
licking my face. I can’t give those firefighters enough praise.

Lucky escape: Iso fell into this shaft, but apparently survived after landing on garden waste at the bottom

Losing hope: Despite a frantic search, Iso could not be found and distressed Mr Saunders returned home

'They were absolutely fantastic. Iso 
suffered a cut on the top of his head, a gravel abrasion on his side and
a bruise on his muzzle.

'The vet couldn’t believe his injuries were so minor after such a fall.

'The
firefighter who went down the shaft said it was very spongy at the 
bottom, so it may be that someone had thrown garden waste down the 
shaft, which saved Iso’s life.'

Safe and sound: Iso back home with Mr Saunders. The vet couldn't believe the dog had suffered such minor injuries after a fall of that height

Turning up the volume: When Mr Saunders returned the site the next day, he was met by a team of firefighters who suggested he whistle into a microphone while they lowered a speaker into the mine

Scene: Radnor Golf Club near Redruth, where the operation to find Iso finally ended in success when he recognised Mr Saunders' whistle and began barking, which allowed rescuers to pull him out unscathed

Commander Dave Carlisle, of Cornwall 
Fire Service, said: 'West Cornwall is littered with mine shafts and 
after heavy rain, adits open up so it is an ongoing problem.'

Mr Saunders said Iso had failed to become a police sniffer dog because his first interest is hunting not retrieving.

He said: 'He’s the most intelligent dog I’ve ever owned but he’s only two years old. It was his enthusiasm that got the better of him - but he will be on a lead in the future.'
