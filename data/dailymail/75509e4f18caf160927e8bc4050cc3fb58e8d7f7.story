Eleven women are suing a Washington state police department over claims that they were inappropriately filmed as they undressed and used a jail cell toilet.

Seattle attorney James Egan, who has filed the lawsuit against Puyallup police department, on behalf on the eleven women and one man, said: 'This is pervy, a peepshop ... there is no excuse.'

His clients claim that when they were booked for DUI, which normally does not require changing into jail clothes, they were directed to change in a jail cell that had a wall-mounted security camera.

Caught on camera: A woman is filmed getting undressed in a police cell

Mr Egan first noticed the practice two years ago, while working on a case for two women arrested for DUI, who were told to strip even though they were about to be booked, according to King 5 News.

Concerned by what he saw, he made a public request for more jail footage to see if a pattern emerged.

'It appeared from my limited review that it was happening to women - attractive women, in particular,' he told King 5.

One of the alleged victims, who has asked not to be identified, said: 'I thought it was maybe for seeing if we have contraband or something but we are already patted down. So then, why would there be a camera still?'

In another case, a jailer allegedly 
asked one of the women who had changed into the jail uniform to go back 
into the cell and remove her underwear, saying it was jail protocol, Mr 
Egan told the News Tribune.

'What possible security reason could they have … she’s going to hang 
herself with her panties?' he said, adding that she was due to be released.

However, Captain Scott Engle, of Puyallup Police Department, said it was a needed protocol to protect officers and inmates.

'No excuse': Attorney James Egan claims filming in cells is like 'a peep show'

'People who come into the corrections environment commonly hide narcotics, contraband, weapons or other miscellaneous things on their body or in their clothing,' he said.

A spokesman for Puyallup told King 5 News video surveillance was standard in holding cells, as was stripping and changing into jail clothes.

They added there was no evidence of exploitation by the police.

'We see no wrongdoing on the part of anyone at the jail,' Captain Engle said.

Many of the alleged victims had no idea they had been filmed until they were contacted by Mr Egan.

One recalled feeling sick as she watched the footage for the first time, adding: 'I [didn't] believe my own eye. It's me. I felt sick to the stomach.'

The alleged victims claim the recordings, which have to be kept by the police department under state laws for several years, are criminal voyeurism.

One woman said she first realized she had been filmed when a jailer allegedly commented on the way she had used the toilet.

'I felt even more violated because I knew they were watching,' she said.

Architect Kenneth Burns, who has designed 40 jail facilities, said: 'You do have lots of cameras, you do watch a lot of things but you cannot watch anywhere where someone is using the shower, toilet facility or a changing area.'

Allegations: Puyallup police department is being sued by 11 women and a man

A city attorney said the cameras were needed in case an inmate claimed they had been injured in the jail.

Captain Engle added the cameras were in plain sight and signs on doors state video surveillance is used.

He told the News Tribune no one had complained about the practice before Mr Egan got involved and added: 'All arrestes booked into the Puyallup City Jail are treated the exact same way.'
