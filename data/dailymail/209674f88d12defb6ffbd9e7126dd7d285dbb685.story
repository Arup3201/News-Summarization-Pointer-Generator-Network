The burning alive of a Muslim man by the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) has jolted the president of the United States into acknowledging publicly that the world's chief terror threat comes from people who 'profess to stand up for Islam but instead betray it.'

But that stark conclusion, long missing in the White House, was followed by a litany of other wrongs done in the name of religion.

'Lest we get on our high horse and think this is unique to some other place,' Obama told the National Prayer breakfast on Thursday morning, 'remember that during the Crusades and the Inquisition, people committed terrible deeds in the name of Christ.'

'In our home country, slavery and Jim Crow all too often was justified in the name of Christ.'

But 'no God condones terror,' he insisted.

Early in his speech Obama hinted at the ISIS terror army by noting that 'professions of faith' have been 'used both as an instrument of great good, but also twisted and misused in the name of evil.'

Faith, he said, is often 'twisted and distorted, used as a wedge, or worse, sometimes used as a weapon.'

Then he got specific.

'From a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris, we have seen violence and terror perpetrated by people who profess to stand up for faith – their faith – (who) profess to stand up for Islam but in fact are betraying it,' Obama said.

'You see ISIL,' he continued, referring to ISIS by his preferred alternate acronym, 'a brutal, vicious death cult that in the name of religion carried out unspeakable acts of barbarism, terrorizing religious minorities like the Yezidis, subjecting women to rape as a weapon of war, and claiming the mantle of religious authority for such actions.'

Obama also condemned Syria's intra-Islam sectarian conflicts, Nigeria's runaway tide of murders hitting both Muslims and Christians, a religious war in the Central African Republic and 'antisemitism and hate crimes' in Europe as evidence that bad actors 'seek to hijack religions for their own murderous ends.'

His clear linkage of ISIS with Islam stands in sharp contrast to his January 16 joint press conference with British Prime Minister David Cameron.

While Cameron came out swinging against 'a very serious Islamist extremist terrorist threat in Europe, in America, (and) across the world,' 

Obama declined to frame ISIS as a radical Muslim sect, calling them 'terrorists' and 'fanatics' instead.

Keeping with his administration's policy to label foreign fighters as 'terrorists,' Obama would not refer to the religion of ISIS militants during the White House news conference but at one point called them 'fanatics.' 

The White House has scheduled a 'combating violent extremism' summit for later in February, and Obama's spokesman Josh Earnest has taken great pains to avoid giving the impression that it might be particularly critical of a narrow group of Muslims.

But the gruesome videotaped murder of Jordanian Air Force pilot Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh may have shaken the White House into a more aggressive posture since its online release on Tuesday.

ISIS militants are seen in the footage burning the 26-year-old man alive as he struggles in a giant animal cage, and then burying his charred body, twisted cage and all, under a cascade of broken concrete.

Jordanian intelligence officials believe the grisly execution was carried out as early as January 3, meaning Al-Kaseasbeh was dead long before the Obama-Cameron press conference.

Jordan's King Abdullah II was scheduled to read a passage of Qur'anic scripture at the prayer breakfast but did not appear: He was back in his home country dealing with the fallout from al-Kaseasbeh's death and the wrath of a country bent on revenge.

Abdullah ordered the execution of two al-Qaeda prisoners in retaliation.

The prayer breakfast, an annual event that Obama has attended every year since becoming president, attracted 3,600 people from all 50 states and 130 countries.

Its most conspicuous guest on Thursday was the Dalai Lama, a revered Tibetan monk embroiled in a long political dispute with China over Tibet's independence.

He has never before attended a public event with an American president, as American administrations have been cautious about antagonizing Beijing.

But Obama said Thursday that he had welcomed him to the White House on several occasions and considered the Lama 'a good friend.'

The holy man was seated at the front-most round table in a cavernous ballroom along with presidential adviser Valerie Jarrett and other dignitaries, directly in front of the speakers' podium.

He is 'a powerful example of what it means to practice and act,' Obama said. 'He inspires speak up for freedom and dignity of all human beings.'
