Two of boxing's greatest heavyweights descended on New York on Thursday night for a screening of new documentary Champs.

Featuring former world champions Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield and Bernard Hopkins, the film examines the lives of the three men in and outside of the ring.

And the two giants of the sport made a special appearance at Village East Cinema.

Directed by Bert Marcus, Champs focuses on the aforementioned trio's rise from poverty to the top of the sport.

Tyson and Holyfield, of course, twice met in the ring and have rebuilt their relationship since their controversial rematch in 1997 when Tyson took a chunk out of his opponent's ear.

Both are long retired but 50-year-old Hopkins has yet to announce whether he plans to continue after losing to hard-hitting Russian Sergey Kovalev last November.

Tyson, meanwhile, has admitted that UFC champion Ronda Rousey might 'kick his ass'.

Rousey defended her bantamweight title last month when she submitted Cat Zingano in just 14 seconds.

'S***, Ronda Rousey might kick my ass,' Tyson told the Huffington Post. 'That 14 seconds the last fight, s*** man, you got to take that seriously. 

'She's marketed herself, and not necessarily from a publicist's perspective. She put in the work, too. She's putting these people to bed, she's tapping them out, she's doing the 14-second thing.'
