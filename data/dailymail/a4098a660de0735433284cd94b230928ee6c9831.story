Liverpool vice-captain Jordan Henderson has revealed he wanted to protect his side's younger players when he decided to confront Chelsea striker Diego Costa during a Capital One Cup clash at Anfield.

Henderson decided to square up to Costa during the encounter, which took place back in January, before confronting the Spain international inside the tunnel.

The 24-year-old, speaking exclusively to the Sunday Telegraph, has stated why he decided to approach Costa.

Henderson was unhappy with the way Costa (far left) conducted himself during the match back in January 

Henderson said: 'I didn't want to make any statement. It was just in that game, he was trying to intimidate some of our younger players, which I didn't really like. 

'He's a fantastic player that any team would want because of that passion and aggression he's got. I just don't like the way he was doing things with our players.'

Henderson, who is expected to start against Manchester United in his side's crunch clash at Anfield, has been tipped to replace Steven Gerrard as Liverpool captain at the end of the season - and the former Sunderland man is keen to take up the role. 

He added: 'It would be an absolute honour to be captain. I'd love it. At the same time, we have a lot of leaders and characters in the group that could do it as well. 

'If it was someone else, I'd be right behind them.'
