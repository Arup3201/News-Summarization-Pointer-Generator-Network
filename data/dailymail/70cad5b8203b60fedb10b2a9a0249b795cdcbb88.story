Five guards and four foreigners were killed when gunmen stormed a luxury hotel in Tripoli, triggering an hours-long standoff.

The attack on the Corinthia Hotel, which sits along the Mediterranean Sea, underscores Libya's lawlessness since the Western-backed campaign to overthrow and kill Muammar Gaddafi.

The US State Department said it was looking into reports of an American casualty in the attack, which only ended when two of the attackers blew themselves up with a grenade.

Libyan militants sympathetic to the Middle East's Islamic State insurgency claimed responsibility for the attack.

The attack started in the morning and included a car bombing, said Essam al-Naas, a spokesman for a Tripoli security agency.

Libya's security forces responded and after several hours of a stand-off, the attackers threw a grenade at the security forces, killing themselves and a security guard.

Ten people were also wounded in the attack, including security guards and guests.

'The operation is over,' Mr al-Naas said, but added that the streets around Corinthia remained closed. He said an investigation was under way.

Earlier in the day, Mahmoud Hamza, commander of the Special Deterrent Force, told private satellite television station al-Nabaa that five foreigners were killed, without elaborating, but Mr al-Naas later revised the casualty toll.

It was not clear if the two assailants were the only ones involved in the attack, earlier reports claimed one militant had been arrested.

As the standoff developed, a security official said the gunmen had taken hostages, though he had no further details. Two commercial landmark towers behind the hotel were evacuated out of security concerns, he said. 

A member of staff in the hotel said the attack began when five masked gunmen wearing bulletproof vests stormed the hotel after security guards at the hotel's gate tried to stop them.

He said they entered the hotel and fired randomly at the staff in the lobby.

The staffer said the gunmen fired in his direction when he opened his door to look out. He said he joined the rest of the staff and foreign guests fleeing out the hotel's back doors into the parking lot.

When they got there, he said a car bomb exploded in the parking lot, only a hundred meters away.

He said this came after a protection force entered the lobby and opened fire on the attackers. He said two guards were immediately killed.

The staffer spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared being targeted later by militants. He said the car bomb left at least five cars in the parking lot burned and damaged some windows in the hotel's facade.

He said the hotel had Italian, British and Turkish guests, but it was largely empty at the time of the attack.

He said the militia-backed Prime Minister Omar al-Hassi usually resides at the hotel, but was not there Tuesday. Al-Hassi's security guards also weren't there, he said. The hotel previously came under attack in 2013 when a former prime minister was abducted there. 

EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini expressed concern, calling the attack 'another reprehensible act of terrorism which deals a blow to efforts to bring peace and stability to Libya'

EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini expressed concern, calling the attack 'another reprehensible act of terrorism which deals a blow to efforts to bring peace and stability to Libya'.

She expressed 'solidarity with the victims and their families' but provided no details of casualties.

'Such attacks should not be allowed to undermine the political process,' Ms Mogherini said in a statement.

A spokesman for the Malta-based Corinthia Hotel chain, Matthew Dixon, told AFP by telephone: 'Our thoughts are with our staff and guests. We have no further information.'

Since Gaddafi's ousting, Libya has been torn among competing militias and tribes vying for power.

The Islamist-backed Fajr Libya (Libya Dawn) militia alliance took control of Tripoli last summer, forcing the country's internationally recognised government to flee to the far east.

The militia-backed government in Tripoli said the target of the attack was Prime Minister Omar al-Hassi. Spokesman Amr Baiou told reporters Mr al-Hassi was unharmed.

In a brief statement on Twitter, the Tripoli branch of Isis claimed to have stormed the hotel, the SITE Intelligence monitoring group said.
