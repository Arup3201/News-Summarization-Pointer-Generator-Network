A man in New Mexico was having the best day of his life on Friday —  until cops caught him trying to steal a police bait car.

Cops say that Drew Mayo, 21, circled the car in southeast Albuquerque for a few times before deciding to enter the vehicle about 10pm.

He quickly noticed the car wasn't locked and decided to take it for a spin, not knowing it was baited to catch car thieves.

Then he turned on the radio.

'Ironically, enough, the song playing on the radio was 'Best Day of My Life' as he is taking the vehicle,' Lt. Paul Szych told KOAT.

Caught: Drew Mayo, 21, grins as he listens to 'Best Day of My Life' while driving away a stolen police bait car in Albuquerque

Mayo looked perfectly satisfied with finding an unlocked vehicle, just seconds before cops arrested him for stealing the police bait car

Mayo was caught on the bait car's dash cam grinning and having a blast while speeding away to the sound of the 2013 hit by the indie rock band American Authors.

A few blocks down, officers killed the car's engine remotely and arrested Mayo.

He is charged with unlawfully taking a motor vehicle.

For Szych, whose department routinely places bait cars around Albuquerque, Mayo was 'absolutely not' having the best day of his life.

'It seems this individual made a bad choice, and did something I’m sure he now regrets,' he told KTAO.
