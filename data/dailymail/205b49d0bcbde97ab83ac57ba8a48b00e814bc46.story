Fears emerged today that the deadly MERS illness may have spread in the U.S. after it was revealed a patient spent at least four hours in a busy hospital waiting to be seen.

Authorities said the second U.S. patient to be diagnosed with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome was made to wait at Dr P Phillips Hospital in Orlando, Florida.

Almost eight more hours passed before staff at Orlando's Dr. P. Phillips Hospital determined the patient had traveled from Saudi Arabia, where he worked at a hospital, began to suspect his exposure to MERS and had him moved to an isolation room, the hospital's chief quality control officer said.

Deadly: MERS belongs to the coronavirus family that also includes the common cold and SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome

MERS is a virus from the same family as 
SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed around 800 
people worldwide after it first appeared in China in 2002.

Like SARS, the virus causes a lung infection, coughing and breathing difficulties, and a temperature.

Additionally, MERS can also lead to rapid kidney failure.

There are no vaccines or antiviral treatments for MERS, and the disease kills approximately 30 per cent of those infected.

According to recent WHO figures, 496 MERS cases have been detected since September 2012.

The Saudi Arabia Health Ministry confirmed that 463 of these cases have been in the Gulf nation alone.

The official, Dr. Antonio Crespo, said that as of Tuesday, he had changed procedures in the emergency department of Dr P Phillips Hospital so that any patient who comes in with flu-like symptoms will be asked whether they traveled to Saudi Arabia or other countries experiencing MERS outbreaks.

'That is one of the learning lessons of this experience. Yes, we could have asked this sooner. I think we have created more awareness,' Crespo told Reuters in an interview.

The extended window of time may have exposed hospital staff and other patients to the virus, which is responsible for a worsening outbreak in Saudi Arabia and is estimated to kill about a third of infected patients.

Florida officials said on Tuesday two healthcare workers who were in contact with the patient in the ER late last week had since developed flu-like symptoms and were being tested for MERS.

However results published today were negative for the virus.

The possibility that the illness, which has no known treatment, was spreading raised new concerns about the ability of global health officials to contain it.

While the Orlando patient waited to be admitted, he was treated in a single room in the emergency department where healthcare workers wore gloves and gowns due to his diarrhea, but did not wear goggles and face masks appropriate for protecting them from the virus, Crespo said.

Florida officials said they were monitoring the health of 20 healthcare workers who had been in contact with the patient, including a doctor who had already left for Canada.

They also were trying to track down nearly 100 people who may have overlapped with the patient at two Orlando medical facilities he visited.

MERS is a respiratory illness that begins with flu-like fever and cough but can lead to shortness of breath, pneumonia and death.

The White House said that President Barack Obama had been briefed on the MERS cases in the U.S.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama's team is watching the situation very closely and that the Centers for Disease Control is coordinating responses along with Florida officials.

A total of 152 people have now died and 
495 have been confirmed to have contracted the virus in Saudi Arabia 
since it was discovered in 2012. Most cases of the disease have been in 
the desert kingdom.
