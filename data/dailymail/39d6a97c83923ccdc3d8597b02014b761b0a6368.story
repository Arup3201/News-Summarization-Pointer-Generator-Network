This is the moment a suspected thief wearing a Cookie Monster t-shirt allegedly stole a rare tortoise worth £160 by hiding it up his shirt and brazenly walking out of a pet store.

Workers had no idea what had happened to the rare tortoise when it vanished from its display pen at Zoar's Ark Garden Centre in Neath, Wales.

Pet store owner Martin Jones said he only realised the animal had been stolen after re-watching CCTV footage but said he was ‘shocked and horrified’ by the theft.

The rare leopard tortoise was two years old and worth £160. Pet store owner Martin Jones said he was 'shocked and horrified' by the theft

He said: ‘It was a leopard tortoise that was two years old, worth £160. He broke into the display vivarium and put the tortoise under his coat.

‘We noticed it was missing when we were cleaning out the vivarium. We checked our CCTV and couldn’t believe a customer had put it under his t-shirt.’

Assistant Sarah Matthews said: ‘We had really got attached to the tortoise- it is lovely looking with leopard like markings.

‘It is quite a young tortoise and needs the correct food, vitamins and minerals and has to be kept in a temperature, between 80 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit.’

South Wales Police said officers had released the CCTV for help in identifying the suspect, who was wearing a Sesame Street Cookie Monster top
