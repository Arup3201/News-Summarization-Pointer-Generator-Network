Two brothers have been kicked out of classes at school and made to study in isolation because they have spiky haircuts.

Keiran Matthews, 16, and his 13-year-old brother Callum, returned for lessons at Marches School in Oswestry, Shropshire, last week proudly sporting their new styles.

But teachers branded their haircuts 'extreme' and took them out of their classes and placed them in isolation instead.

Keiran Matthews and his brother Callum, who were both taken out of classes at school because they have spiky hair 

They said that the style, which is closely shaved on the sides but spiky on top, broke school rules and their policy on uniform.

Today, the teens' father Tony, 44, told of his anger at the ban on the style, which is called the skinfade, as he says most children are sporting it these days.

He explained: 'I understood the school has its policies that include hairstyles.

'But I’m just angry they seem to have been singled out.

'There are so many boys at the Marches that have the same haircut and they do not seem to have been sent to the pastoral room.

The brothers were being made to study by themselves in isolation after teachers branded their hairstyles 'extreme' 

'It’s an area where children are segregated from the rest of the school.

'They are not allowed to go outside for break and Callum had his lunch brought to him - a pizza that he said was cold and he couldn’t eat.' 

Mr Matthews said it was only when he mentioned that other boys, including his older son, had similar haircuts, that Keiran was also told to work in pastoral.

He added: 'When they contacted me last week and said that yet again they were going into pastoral, then I went and picked them up from school.

'Keiran is in his last year at school and, with exams coming up, it is vital that he goes into lessons.

'The boys and I have talked about hairstyles and we have agreed that in the future they will not have hairstyles such as this.'

Sarah Longville, headteacher at the school, which caters for 1,200 pupils aged 11 to 18, said: 'We are unable to discuss individual cases involving students due to their age and vulnerability.

'We have clear policies at the school, that have been in place for many years, and parents/carers and students are made fully aware of these.

'We set high standards for all students and when our policies are not adhered to, we work supportively with parents and the appropriate action is taken.'
