A former teacher who groomed a schoolboy 26 years his junior after they met on gay hook-up app Grindr has been jailed for five years.

Gary Pearce messaged and swapped naked photographs with the 14-year-old on the Grindr app over the course of several weeks before arranging a meeting for sex.

The boy had been 'curious' when he downloaded the app, which is for over-18s, and then lied about his age to sign up.

Pearce, 40, then drove in his sports car to meet the boy in the car park of Asda in Bexleyheath at the end of the summer holidays in 2012.

They then went back to Pearce's house in Sidcup, Kent, where he performed sex acts on the teenager. 

They then showered before Pearce dropped him back at the car park, a court heard.

However, the boy's mother discovered messages on her son's mobile phone and confronted him before calling the police.

When Pearce was arrested, detectives found four indecent images of children in the trash folder of his computer which had been downloaded sometime around 2009.

He admitted picking up the schoolboy and having sex but maintains he thought the boy was over the age of 16 - the age of consent. 

He made no comment to any other police questions and was charged in July last year.

He had denied sexual activity with a child and sexual grooming but was found guilty at Inner London Crown Court. 

The jury had been shown a video interview given by the boy wearing his school uniform in December 2012 during which he insisted he told Pearce his real age early on.

He told detectives 'I said how old I was, I said I was 14 or 15' before the messaging continued.

Describing how they eventually met, the boy added: 'He waved at me and I was nervous because obviously I had never done it before.

'I don't remember what we talked about but he put his hand on my leg. I didn't expect it so I jumped but not too much.'

They then went to the home and the boy said that he 'showed me around his house' before the pair engaged in a sex act.

Asked how he felt about what had happened during the interview, weeks after meeting Pearce he said: 'Well I now have sort of a girlfriend.' 

Detective Inspector Neal Burton from the Sapphire Command said: 'Pearce utilised the internet to manipulate the child into meeting him. 

'This crime again shows the vulnerability of the internet and social media, which is used by paedophiles to meet their victims.

'This conviction will provide reassurance that we will relentlessly pursue those who commit these dreadful crimes against children.'
