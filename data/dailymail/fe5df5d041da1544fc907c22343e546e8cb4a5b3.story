If you want to keep your car out of the hands of thieves, don’t drive a Suzuki in central Manchester.

Research reveals the city is now  the car crime capital of England  and Wales.

And drivers of Suzukis face the highest risk of having their car stolen.

Worst of the worst: Manchester's city centre is the least safe place to park your car

The findings come from analysis of police car crime figures obtained following a Freedom of Information request by consumer website Honest John.

It said in a report that the highest incidence of vehicle-related crime in the country is in Manchester’s M2 postcode, which covers most of the city centre, where almost one in three cars (32 per cent) is affected.

The report said: ‘Between October 2011 and September 2012, 3,180 crimes per 10,000 cars on the road were reported in Manchester city centre, with theft of possessions accounting for almost half of the cases.’

Liverpool’s central L1 postcode recorded the second highest number of offences with 22 per cent of cars (2,193 offences) affected, followed by Bradford’s BD1 area, with a car crime rate of 21 per cent (2,137 offences), and Birmingham’s B4 postcode with 18 per cent (1,800 offences).

In London, the EC2 postcode is the worst affected area with 12 per cent of cars subject to crime (1,228 offences), putting it tenth on the league table.

When whole cities rather than individual postcodes are counted Manchester again emerges at the top with 505 crimes per 10,000 cars.

By manufacturer, Suzuki had the highest proportionate rate of thefts. For every 10,000 Suzukis on the road some 93 are stolen. That compares with second place Mitsubishi at 42 per 10,000. Individual models most at risk from thieves are, in order, the Mitsubishi Shogun/Pajero, Nissan Sunny. Nissan Bluebird, BMW X6 and Ford Orion

Cars safest from thieves are the Peugeot 508, Skoda Roomster, Skoda Yeti, Suzuki Splash and Suzuki SX4.

The research reveals that 41 per cent of offences were based on theft from a vehicle, making it the most common type of car crime. Next was criminal damage at 40 per cent, followed by theft of a car at 16 per cent.

HonestJohn.co.uk says its Car Crime Census 2013 is the first ever detailed analysis of 515,248 recorded car crimes between October 2011 and September 2012 released by 42 police forces across England and Wales following a Freedom of Information request.
