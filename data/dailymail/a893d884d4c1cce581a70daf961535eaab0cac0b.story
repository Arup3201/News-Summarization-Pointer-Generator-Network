A 'greedy and dishonest' stadium manager at Birmingham City FC who invented imaginary stewards to cover Premier League matches has been jailed for conning the club out of £45,000.

Scheming Peter Smith, 63, fleeced thousands while working for the Blues by putting his family on the payroll and inventing 'ghost' stewards over a three year period.

A court heard the fraudster added his wife, sons and daughter-in-in law to the payroll at St Andrews between December 2009 and April 2012.

He also made up another imaginary steward - by the name of Paul Knowles - and paid those wages into his account to help clear debts and his mortgage.

Birmingham Crown Court heard the club were alerted to the suspicious transactions during an internal audit in April 2012, the year after they were relegated to the Championship.

They contacted West Midlands Police who launched an investigation and found payments had been made to staff who had never carried out their stadium duties.

Specialist fraud investigators probed the club's payroll and uncovered a number of false employment documents.

They also found Smith's wife had never even set foot inside the football stadium, while his two sons and daughter-in-law were on the payroll despite not having any steward training and qualifications.

Smith, from Perton near Wolverhampton, West Midlands, admitted fraud by abuse of position and was yesterday jailed for 18 months.

Detective Constable Catherine Dell, from West Midlands Police, said after the case: 'This was a fraud driven by greed and Smith's frustration that, at the age of 63, he still had a sizeable mortgage.

'Smith began by putting his wife, using her maiden name, on the books and paying wages into his bank account.

'He clearly thought it was easy money and became more audacious by inventing an employee called Paul Knowles and charging the club for steward services.

'This was a blatant abuse of position: he put family members down on attendance lists and signed off their time sheets, including overtime, even though there's no evidence they did any work at the club.

'We scrutinised the payroll for up to 70 matches and corporate club events and when we put the evidence to Smith he was left with no option but to admit the fraud.'

Smith's assets have since been frozen by police who will look to recover the stolen cash through the Proceeds of Crime Act.

Angela Millington, senior prosecutor for West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), added: 'Peter Smith was employed by Birmingham City Football Club as their Safety Officer, a job which involved the club putting a lot of trust in him as he had the responsibility of ensuring the safety and welfare of fans and club officials.

'However, Smith grossly exploited his position of trust and abused his senior position in order to dishonestly receive over £45,000 which was used to enrich himself and his family.

'He exploited the club's employment practices for greed and self-importance, but he has paid the penalty for his abuse of the club's trust.

A Birmingham City FC spokesman, said: 'We are pleased with the outcome.

'The club would like to thank West Midlands Police and the CPS for their thorough investigation.

'This case was prompted by an internal investigation by management staff at the club and no stone was left unturned.

'It is particularly pleasing all of the hard work, dedication and professionalism carried out behind the scenes have resulted in today's judgement.'
