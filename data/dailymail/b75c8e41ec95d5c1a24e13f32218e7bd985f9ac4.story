A five-week-old puppy found locked in a fridge has been nursed back to health after being re-homed by a butcher.

German Shepherd Elsa was found in an abandoned fridge on scrubland in Cheetham Hill, Manchester.

The animal suffered deformities to her front legs as a result of being trapped for more than 24-hours.

RSPCA officers who rescued her feared she may struggle to walk due to her injuries.

Now, two months later, the puppy has been nursed back to health on a diet of quality meat thanks her new owner butcher Suzanne Marsden.

Mrs Marsden, who works at Fraser’s Butchers in Bolton, Greater Manchester, said: 'It was heartbreaking to think Elsa had just been left on her own in a fridge where she couldn’t get out.

'She was so tiny and so scared but she’s now a different dog, and she’s certainly not short of love.

'I bring her home pieces of scrap meat and bones from work to fatten her up, and she’s turning into a really lovely dog.'

Mrs
 Marsden and her husband Paul had previously owned German shepherds. 
Sadly, they had to have their last dog Sadie put down last year.

The couple, who have two children, were approached by Julie Ashcroft, manager of the RSPCA branch in Bolton, to see if they would like to give Elsa a home.

New start: The puppy's new owners say they 'fell in love' with the German Shepherd as soon as she moved in

Mrs Marsden said: 'We have had German Shepherds before so when we heard about Elsa, we knew she was perfect for us.

'We
 fostered her first to see if she was right for us and to see how her 
legs would heal, but she got on with us brilliantly and there was no way
 we could have let her go.

'We
 kept her fed and rested and we fell in love with her fighting spirit 
that had got her through the rough time she’d had in her short life.'

Elsa, who is now 13-weeks-old, no longer has any problems with her front legs, despite previously struggling to walk.

Julie Ashcroft said: 'Elsa has been through such an ordeal. We have to thank Mr and Mrs Marsden as they fostered her when we didn’t know what the outcome would be with her legs.

'They fostered her and fell in love with her. It has been a real happy ending.

'When Elsa was rescued she was very quiet as she was too young to be taken away from her mum. She slept a lot when she first came to the RSPCA but now she has trebled in size. She is a monkey now.'
