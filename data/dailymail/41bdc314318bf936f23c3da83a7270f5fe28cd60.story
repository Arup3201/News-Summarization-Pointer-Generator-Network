Dame Helen Ghosh said women were excluded because 'politics is so driven by networks that women looking after children could not break in'

An ‘Old Etonian clique’ around David Cameron has helped exclude women from top government posts, a former mandarin has claimed.

Dame Helen Ghosh said Westminster politics was driven by powerful groups that women could not break into because they were too busy with children to network like men.

In a talk with students at Cambridge University she appeared to attack the Prime Minister’s ‘network of friends’ and bemoaned the lack of women running Whitehall departments.

The former permanent secretary at the Home Office quit earlier this year after a 33-year Whitehall career.

‘If you look at the current government, not necessarily back to the Bullingdon Club days, but Cameron, it is true, it is well known, has a clique, a network of friends – the friends he made at school, friends he made at university,’ she said.

‘That kind of clique network was reinforced in Cameron’s case by the people who worked for him in opposition, the people who supported him in his leadership bid.’

Mr Cameron’s inner circle includes Old Etonian chief of staff Ed Llewellyn and ‘gatekeeper’ Kate Fall, who met Mr Cameron at Oxford.

The Prime Minister recently made Old Etonian Sir George Young his chief whip and George Osborne’s chief adviser Rupert Harrison is a former head boy at Eton.

Dame Helen told members of the Clare College politics society: ‘The fact that politics is so driven by networks does impact on women.

‘Women don’t network. It is actually quite difficult for a woman to get in as part of an Old Etonian clique.

‘They are far too busy doing other things, like bringing up their children, looking after their constituency. That kind of networking is actually a harder thing for women to do.’

She said that, despite a ‘magical moment’ in 2006 and 2007 – when half of the heads of Government departments were women – top jobs at the Treasury and the Cabinet Office were ‘still going to men, which I regret’.

She added: ‘Female cabinet ministers do a bit of networking among themselves but the other networks in governments are often much, much more powerful – whether it’s the Etonian clique or the Brownites or the Blairites.’

Downing Street reacted angrily to the comments reported by the London Evening Standard.

Officials pointed out that Mr Cameron was surrounded by high profile and powerful women, including his press secretary Gabby Bertin and Liz Sugg, who masterminds his public appearances and travels with him everywhere.

Others observed that Dame Helen quit the Home Office after falling out with Home Secretary Theresa May, only the second woman to hold that senior Cabinet post. After the comments were denounced by the Prime Minister’s official spokesman as ‘not true’, Dame Helen issued a carefully-worded clarification.

She said: ‘It is entirely false to say that I suggested that I think David Cameron surrounds himself by Old Etonians – or that he has too few women in his team. A cursory look at the important roles around him reveals it is simply not the case.’

But the Evening Standard stood by the story, saying it had a tape of Dame Helen’s comments. She did not deny the quotes attributed to her.

Dame Helen Ghoash, who retired as permanent secretary of the Home Office, claimed David Cameron 'has a clique' of friends from school which it is difficult for women to break into

The observations are potentially damaging to Mr Cameron because they strengthen the view held by many MPs that he has a ‘woman problem’ and he is loyal to a fault to friends from school, university and his time in the Conservative Research department. In his September reshuffle, he kept the number of female Cabinet ministers at four but let the proportion of female ministers fall.

Just last week, the World Economic Forum’s annual Global Gender Gap Report revealed Britain had slipped down the global league table as a result of the shake-up.

He has also faced criticism for dismissive comments to female MPs in the Commons. The PM told Labour frontbencher Angela Eagle to ‘calm down dear’ and dismissed Tory backbencher Nadine Dorries as ‘frustrated’.

Miss Dorries said last night: ‘Dame Helen is quite right. Girls do not get to go to Eton and it’s still a boys’ club in Westminster.’

Yvette Cooper, Labour’s spokesman for women, said: ‘Dame Helen Ghosh’s comments about the Prime Minister’s Eton clique are one more reason why women don’t get a look in and why the Government is out of touch.

‘His attitude to women is of a different era.’
