For all his many talents - raw pace, an explosive strike and a strut of arrogance - Arsenal’s strike-force requires greater replenishing than merely the return of Joel Campbell next season.

Campbell appears to be a fine young player, perhaps only usurped by the magnificent Neymar among the younger players at this World Cup so far.

He will prove a valuable addition to the Arsenal squad, now that the work permit issues which forced the club to loan him out to Real Betis and Olympiacos in the last two years have been resolved.

Campbell offers acceleration that will change the dynamics of Arsenal’s attacking thrust. His rapid flourishes will push the opposition back, force defenders to think differently. No longer should they have to rely solely on Olivier Giroud, as was the case for so much of last season.

Campbell, too, seems the kind of hard-working, ball-playing footballer that will respond to the paternal qualities of Arsenal’s manager, Arsene Wenger, and he will be encouraged by the Frenchman’s confirmation that he will be part of the squad for pre-season.

Against England, Campbell demonstrated his qualities once more, nipping in before defenders Chris Smalling and Gary Cahill, mithering Luke Shaw with his direct running and providing the locals in Belo Horizonte with an ‘Ole!’ treat after one classy back-flick.

In a game that was played out at the tempo of a warm-weather pre-season training camp, there were very few at all out there that flirted, even fleetingly, with inspiration.

To his credit, for the sixty-sixty minutes Campbell played, he did as much as any other player to break the stranglehold of tepid mediocrity that enveloped this match, darting in behind at every opportunity, shooting from distance when the opportunity presented itself.

After that, he was rested for the knockout stages, offering a stark reminder of England’s demise as a forward with nine goals in the Greek league last season is conserved for grander occasions.

This is not to belittle Campbell, who was irresistible against both Uruguay and Italy. Certainly, he can make an impact for Arsenal next season. But can he transform Wenger’s side from also-rans to title winners? That much would seem to be the stuff of fantasy and Arsenal fans must dearly hope that Arsene Wenger has greater ambitions in this transfer window.

Arsenal must buy a forward of elite-standing, a game-changer, somebody that will strike fear, rather than comfort, into the defences of the continent’s finest outfits. Campbell, who has scored just eleven club goals in the last two seasons, is evidently not that man. Arsenal fans need a Mario Balotelli, not a chap they’ve only seen on the telly.

In this Costa-Rica team, Campbell is the go-to player, the one that is worshipped.  In this perfectly-oiled, intensely drilled side, Campbell’s ability is blended with adrenalin and a fervent national pride.

When he returns to Arsenal, he will be an understudy with a point to prove. Time will tell whether he can elevate his performances on a consistent basis, but Wenger must know better than to demand too much, too soon.
