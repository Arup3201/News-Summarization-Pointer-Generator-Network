On the 20th anniversary of the brutal murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, the voices of two victims are conspicuously silent - those of Nicole's children.

Justin and Sydney Simpson were just five and eight respectively when their mother was found brutally murdered alongside her friend at her Los Angeles home on June 12, 1994.

Days later, their father OJ Simpson was charged with the murders then later acquitted following a televised, eight-month trial which gripped the nation.

Their aunt Tanya Brown, Nicole's youngest sister, has spoken this week about the close bond she shares with her niece and nephew and how despite the tragedy they have endured, the pair have grown into happy, well-adjusted adults.

The aunt has said that Justin, now
 25, and Sydney, 28, are both in the restaurant business in the 
Southeast.

Ms Brown, 44, told RadarOnline: 'They’re in their late 20s. They’re professional. They’ve gone to college. They’re in relationships. They’re happy. They’re just like us. Quote unquote.'

The aunt said that following their father's 1995 murder trial it was difficult for the children to experience a normal life.

However Ms Brown and the children's grandmother forced themselves to face OJ, who they believe killed Nicole and Ron Goldman, for the sake of the children.

Ms Brown said: 'They will always love their dad. I choose to respect that.'

OJ Simpson and Nicole Brown married in 1985 and 
had two children Sydney and Justin.

In 1989, the former football player 
pleaded no contest to a domestic violence charge against Simpson. The couple 
divorced in 1992.

Tanya Brown also revealed that she has never discussed their mother's murder or OJ Simpson with her niece and nephew.

'They’ve probably talked about it on their own,' she said.

'But when they come to our house we have fun. We don’t need to rehash everything.'

Ms Brown, a life coach and mental-health 
advocate, recently wrote a memoir about the loss of her 
older sister Nicole, entitled Finding Peace Amid The Chaos.

In the emotional book, she revealed the moment she knew that the man she once called 'Uncle OJ' was responsible for her death.

She also described how her family's lives were forever shattered on the morning of June 13, 1994, when they found out that Nicole, recently divorced from OJ Simpson, had been stabbed to death outside her Los Angeles home along with her friend Ronald Goldman.

She said the grief-stricken family watched on TV as her sister's bloodied corpse was loaded into a van to be taken to the morgue. Ms Brown said she held her mother's shaking hands as she wept: 'That's my kid.'

Ms
 Brown said that at first she did not suspect Simpson, the former 
football player turned actor, whom she knew as a beloved brother-in-law.

After her sister's death, Ms Brown said she was exposed to the 
harrowing truth - that Simpson was a violent man who had mentally and physically abused her sister 
for years.

In the days following the murders, the net began to close on Simpson, considered the prime suspect.

On June 17, the day that Simpson was supposed to turn himself over to police on murder charges, the
 former football player led officers on an infamous low-speed pursuit 
in a white Ford Bronco SUV in California.

Simpson finally surrendered to police and was jailed awaiting trial.

The internationally publicized trial 
of O.J. Simpson lasted one year and was dubbed the 'trial of the 
century'. In 1995, Simpson was acquitted of the 1994 murders of his 
ex-wife and Mr Goldman.

The
 anguish for the victims' families did not end there. For Tanya Brown, 
her sister's brutal death unleashed years of depression and drug and 
alcohol abuse that culminated in her almost taking her own life in 2004.

Following psychiatric treatment and therapy, Ms Brown now says she has turned 'this ugly thing into something good'.

In
 2008, Simpson was found guilty of kidnapping, armed robbery and other 
charges in what he said was an attempt to retrieve memorabilia and 
personal items from two sports collectibles dealers in a casino hotel 
room.

Simpson was sentenced 
to between nine to 33 years in Nevada state prison but was granted 
parole on some convictions last July. However he must serve at least 
four more years.

Simpson's conviction came 13 years to the day after he was acquitted of his ex-wife and Mr Goldman's murders.
