A 61-year-old Wisconsin man has been arrested in connection with the nearly 25-year-old murder of a Sturtevant woman whose body was found in a ditch weeks after she disappeared.

Dennis J. Brantner was arrested in Berit Beck's killing after he made an appearance on an unrelated charge in Kenosha County. He's now been charged with first degree homicide.

The 18-year-old Beck was killed in July 1990 after she stopped in Fond du Lac while traveling. Her body was found about six weeks later in a ditch in rural Fond du Lac County.

Break: Police have arrested a suspect in a Wisconsin murder nearly 25 years on. Berit Beck (right) was 18 in July 1990 when she vanished, only to be found strangled in a ditch over a month later. Now, local trucker Dennis Brantner, 61, (left) has been arrested for the crime

Authorities said last year they had evidence that pointed Brantner and named him as a suspect. A court document says his fingerprints were on items in Beck's van.

'This has always been a no-win situation no matter how it works out,' Fond du Lac County Sheriff Mick Fink told the Fond du Lac Reporter.

'We will go forward. We talked with the Becks and they have been notified.'  

Beck was heading to a work seminar in Appleton, Wisconsin when she vanished. It is believed she stopped at a Walgreens during her journey, which is the last place she was seen alive.

According to a complaint obtained by the Fond du Lac Reporter, 'no physical evidence directly links ... (anyone) other than Dennis J. Brantner to the GMC van Berit Beck was last seen driving.'

Police say Brantner's fingerprints were found March 11 on a cigarette cellophane that was inside Beck's van.

When he was interviewed by police last year, he said he had no idea how they got there. However, he reportedly asked police 'why would I do anything like that in the first place?' before police told him she was a murder victim. 

Physical evidence: Brantner was first named as a suspect in 2014 but told police he had nothing to do with the cold case murder. However, Fond du Lac police say they've since connected him, and only him, to the van Beck was driving when she vanished using fingerprints

He soon became emotional, however.

'I don't remember anything. I don't wanna,' Brantner told police. '(If) I did I did...if I did I don't know.'

Though he was not in custody at the time of Beck's disappearance, Brantner was arrested on an unrelated matter two weeks later on August 6 1990 and has a criminal record going back to the 1970s.

And, in 1994, he was arrested for kidnapping and beating his estranged second wife.

Brantner was unknown to Beck's family prior to police naming him as a suspect in 2014. Meanwhile, they have asked for privacy in the matter.

'We are encouraged and relieved for this day to have arrived for Berit and our family. We request that our privacy be respected as this process unfolds,' the family said through a police press release.

Speaking at a press conference last year, Sheriff Fink was hopeful about the developments.

'This is the best physical evidence that we've had in this case,' he said. 'It was the first time that I thought we had tangible, physical evidence to intimately put someone in the interior of that van.'
