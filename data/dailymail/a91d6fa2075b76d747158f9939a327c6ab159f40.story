An Australian mother, 51, has appeared in court on charges of drug smuggling in Malaysia.

Maria Elvira Pinto Exposto was allegedly found with 1.5 kilograms of methamphetamines - also known as ice - at Kuala Lumpur airport during a stopover.

The woman, from Liverpool in Sydney's west, told her lawyers she was not guilty and she was asked by a United States soldier in Afghanistan to carry a bag that unknowingly contained the drugs, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Defence lawyer Muhammed Shafee Abdullah said Ms Pinto had been 'used by unscrupulous people' and would likely be able to prove she was not guilty of the charge.

'There is a very strong chance that she is one of those naive and innocent mules that has been used by some unscrupulous people,' he told reporters at the court.  

She faced a Kuala Lumpur court on Sunday - which was closed to the public and the media - when she remained in custody and is set to reappear again on Friday when she is expected to be charged.

After her appearance, Mr Shafee told reporters Ms Pinto was told by the soldier that he needed documents inside the bag to be taken to Melbourne in order to organise his discharge.

Ms Exposto's children said they have been concerned about their mother.

'We all love our mum," the family told the Nine Network.

'We are all worried for her and all praying for the best.'

The mother - who could face the death penalty - was told she would then hand over the bag to another person at Melbourne airport.

But before Ms Pinto was able to board the next leg of her flight, she was stopped by airport customs while she was en route to the Victorian capital from Shanghai.

Customs director Chik Omar Chik Lim said the Liverpool woman was about to board about 5pm when the scanner picked up the methamphetamines 'wrapped in plastic and stashed inside a secret compartment in her travel bag'.

She was then questioned by police about the drugs that were detected, which are worth $93,000 in Malaysia.

The mother, 51, said she was carrying the bag on behalf of a U.S. soldier in Afghanistan who told her she was going to pass it on to someone at Melbourne airport (above)

Since 1960, more than 440 people have been hanged in the south-east Asian country.

Hanging is inevitable for people who are found guilty of smuggling more than 50 grams of methamphetamines.   

The arrest follows the release of 22-year-old Australian Kalynda Davis who was arrested in China on drug smuggling charges earlier this month.

Ms Davis faced execution by firing squad along with New Zealander Peter Gardner for allegedly attempting to smuggle methamphetamine into Australia from China.

While Miss Davis returned home to Sydney earlier this week, Mr Gardner remains in Chinese custody.
