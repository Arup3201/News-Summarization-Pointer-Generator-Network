A man who stood up against a woman's alleged groper at a September event is now facing a lawsuit from that same man, local media reported.

While at Tulsa's Bank of Oklahoma Center, Melissa Smith told Newson6 in September her behind was hit and clutched two times by a man.

Smith hollered at the man, she told the affiliate station.

Incident: After she was groped, Melissa Smith, left, was approached by onlooker Shane Vernon, right, who then looked for the man and yelled at him 

Investigation: Leonel Olivarez confessed to investigators he was intoxicated when the touching occurred, and also penned a letter for Smith in which he said he was sorry, police have said 

Onlooker Shane Vernon said in an interview with Newson6 he went up to Smith to see if everything was alright - and that when questioned, Smith told Vernon she didn't know the man who touched her.

He told Newson6 he looked for the man and said 'I was screaming in his face, "I don't appreciate what you were doing," basically telling him, you don't know that young lady, grabbing her butt. People were looking at me like I was nuts.'

Vernon also said 'I grabbed his cigars and threw them into the arena, and I was still amped up so I grabbed his cowboy hat and threw that into the arena.'

Back in September, Smith told the affiliate station that 'it was amazing to see how somebody else could stand up for someone who could see it was wrong.'

Leonel Olivarez confessed to investigators he was intoxicated when the touching occurred, and also penned a letter for Smith in which he said he was sorry, police told Newson6 in September.

Newson6, citing an affidavit, says Olivarez showed investigators the way the groping took place 

Plaintiff: Leonel Olivarez has filed an assault and battery lawsuit against Vernon 

Newson6 reported Friday that Smith 'is shocked the stranger's actions now have him facing a lawsuit.'

Vernon is facing an assault and battery lawsuit from Leonel Olivarez - who himself is facing a felony sexual battery charge, according to the media outlet.

The affiliate station reported that 'The lawsuit claims Vernon grabbed Olivarez's shoulder in an aggressive manner suggesting an imminent physical attack that was unjustified and designed to embarrass and humiliate Olivarez.

'It also says the allegation of Olivarez grabbing a woman was not true.'

The affiliate station, citing an affidavit, said Olivarez physically showed investigators the way the groping took place.

Newson6 reported that Olivarez's lawyer 'said Olivarez is the victim of an assault and battery by the alleged Good Samaritan. He says they do not believe the original news story was fair, but can't say anything additional now because they want the case tried in court, not in the media.'

Citing a need to find legal representation, Vernon did not comment to Newson6 on the lawsuit.
