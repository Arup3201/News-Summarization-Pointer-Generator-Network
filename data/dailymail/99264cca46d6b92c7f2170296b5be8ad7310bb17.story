They provide one of the great intrigues of the human race.

For centuries scientists and psychologists have attempted to unravel the mysteries of twins and how siblings who share almost identical genetic make-ups can often be so different.

Now a landmark project by National Geographic - using both photography and science - has attempted to shed some light on our fascination with twins.

Scientists are intrigued by twins as they share an almost-identical genetic code, leaving 
differences between them down to environmental factors such as how many 
hours of sun they get.

Photogenic six-year-olds Johanna and Eva Gill are
 just two of many subjects portrayed in the National Geographic 
feature.

Martin
 Schoeller, of New York, took the charming photo of the Gill girls, who 
both have mild autism, in which Johanna is seen putting a protective 
hand on Eva.

‘It's
 very clear when you look at twins that much of what they share is 
hardwired,’ researcher Danielle Reed told National Geographic. ‘Many 
things about them are absolutely the same.

‘But it's also clear, when you get to know them, that other things about them are different.’

Another set of twins featured in the National Geographic study are Don and Dave Wolf, of Fenton, Michigan, who have been truck-driving partners for 18 years.

‘We're
 wired the same,’ Don Wolf, 53, said. ‘He's messier than I am. But we 
like the same music and share the same sense of humour.’ The brothers have driven more than three million miles together.

The National Geographic study is the latest scientific exploration into the world of twins.

One of the most famous studies was the 'Minnesota Twin Family Study' led by David Lykken, which 
looked at 65 pairs of twins separated in infancy from the 1970s.

It
 showed that almost every psychological trait is mostly down to 
genetics. But as long ago as 1875, British scientist Sir Francis Galton 
had made a similar observation.

A whole century on, University of Minnesota psychologist Thomas Bouchard Jr performed a study on twins' intelligence beginning in the 1970s that ruffled many feathers in the scientific community.

It helped him conclude that IQ differences are largely down to inheritance - not education. This was a controversial view as experts had said for decades that intelligence was taught and not hereditary.

Other examples of twins that have captured the public's attention include Jennifer and 
June Gibbons.

The troubled teenage Gibbons twins became known for their 11-year sentences at Broadmoor 
psychiatric hospital in Berkshire, England, for arson. Jennifer died 
aged 30 in 1993.

Twins are born with an almost-identical genetic code, but can still have surprising physical or psychological differences that mean they lead wildly different lives.

For example, one can be left-handed and the other right - as in the Bryan champion tennis brothers. Or one can adapt better to unusual social situations than the other.

But many decide to lead similar lives and even make something of the fact they are twins to help propel them to stardom - such as actors Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.

Scientists say twins often develop much closer bonds than fraternal brothers and sisters, which was shown by the notorious delinquent Gibbons twins' secret language.

But it 
was before their psychiatric sentence that they were most interesting to 
psychologists, as they developed a secret language and communication system, which appeared to be almost telepathic.

Another example emerged 10 years ago when almost 3,000 people were killed in 
the attacks on 9/11 - and 46 of them were twins. Greg Hoffman thought 
about committing suicide after losing his twin brother Stephen in the 
New York attack.

New York City firefighter Zachary Fletcher, 47, arrived at the World Trade Center scene shortly before the south tower fell and had seen his twin Andre’s fire engine going ahead of him.

'I said: “I love you”,' said Zachary. 'He said: “I love you too, bro”. You know, the weird thing about it is why did I say: “I love you”? I rarely told my brother I loved him. I mean, because we knew it. It was just something you knew.’

Meanwhile even today it was reported that the
 twin sister of the beautiful model who lost her hand and left eye in a 
plane accident in Plano, Texas, believes she can literally feel her sister's pain, according to her mother.

Lauren 
Scruggs had a horrific accident earlier this month when she 
collided with a plane propeller.

Many twins gather for the 
Twins Days Festival, which takes place every August in Twinsburg, Ohio. 
The town was named by identical twin brothers almost 200 years ago.

Scientists go to the event to 
learn more about twins, and at this year’s festival there was a tent 
sponsored by the FBI and two universities, which used face-recognition 
software to tell apart twins.

Other
 researchers wanted to know if twins react differently to alcohol, reported National Geographic.

Researchers
 also believe that disease must be at least somewhat hereditary if 
identical twins are more vulnerable to an illness than fraternal twins.

Jodi Cobb, of Washington D.C., also 
took a number of photos for the National Geographic project - including 
one of the number one doubles team Mike and Bob Bryan.

The tennis duo have won more than 70 
championships between them, including a title at the Wimbledon 
Championships in London earlier this year.

The
 33-year-olds, who live in Wesley Chapel, Florida, are so good at 
predicting each other’s movements that some opponents joke that they 
must be telepathic.

Bob measures 6’4” and weight 202lbs, while his brother comes in slightly lower at 6’3” and 192lbs.

The photos are among many more in the January 2012 issue of National Geographic magazine, which is on newsstands now. For more about 'A Thing or Two About Twins', click here and here.
