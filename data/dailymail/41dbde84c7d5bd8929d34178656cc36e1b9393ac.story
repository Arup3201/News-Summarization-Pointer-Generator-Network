Pippa Middleton will meet her new nephew this evening after travelling to Kensington Palace to celebrate the arrival of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's first child.

The Duchess of Cambridge's sister travelled to the west London palace with her boyfriend Nico Jackson.

Prince William and Kate were pictured arriving into the grounds of Kensington Palace after earlier leaving the private Lindo Wing at St Mary's Hospital in London.

Celebration: Crowds of people waved and cheered as the young family headed into their home

They waved in front of screaming 
crowds and masses of journalists from around the world as they left the 
hospital, 26 hours after the heir to the throne was delivered, weighing 
8lbs 6oz.

The proud parents are expected to spend two weeks at Kensington Palace while William is on paternity 
leave.

As well as Pippa, other family members are also thought to have been waiting at the palace to celebrate the birth.

Speaking outside the hospital 
earlier, an obviously moved Duchess of Cambridge said: 'It's been very 
emotional. Any parent will know what this feeling is like.'

Home: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge headed to Kensington Palace in west London after leaving the hospital this evening

The Duke of Cambridge had followed the steps his parents Charles and Diana took with him 31 years ago, when he was born there on June 21, 1982.

'He's a big boy, quite heavy. We're still working on a name,' he told reporters.

'Well he has a good pair of lungs on him, that's for sure’

Confirming that the prince was overdue, William said: ‘I will remind him of his tardiness when he is older.’

With a huge smile he then added: ‘He’s got her looks thankfully’ to which the Duchess responded ‘No, no, no I’m not sure about that.’

The Duchess wore a lilac purple dress, with her long hair falling in waves around her face. The new father wore a  blue open neck shirt rolled up to his sleeves with black trousers.

The couple then returned in to the 
hospital as William held his son, swaddled in a blanket, before bringing
 him out again in his car seat

William
 then breathed a huge sigh of relief when he successfully installed his 
baby on the back seat with his wife, before driving them home to 
Kensington Palace surrounded by a cheering crowd.

Carole and Michael Middleton were the first to arrive at the private
 Lindo Wing at around 3pm today, with Prince Charles and his wife 
Camilla following them at 5.30pm after being rushed to London by 
helicopter after two-days carrying out official duties in Yorkshire.

Before
 mounting the St Mary's Hospital steps, the smiling Prince of Wales 
asked journalists who have been stood outside for almost three weeks: 
'Have you been there long?'
