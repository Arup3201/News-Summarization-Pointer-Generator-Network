Join us in our campaign to say 'Hands Off In The Box' to players and referees.

We’ll be naming and shaming the cheats and the officials who let them get away with it.

Eliaquim Mangala has been caught as the latest culprit of Sportsmail's 'Hands Off In The Box' campaign, when he was seen grappling in the penalty area with Newcastle United’s Paul Dummett as the Premier League champions stuttered at the Etihad Stadium.

The £32million summer signing from Porto has struggled to find his feet in England and had his hands all over Dummett from a corner.

Mangala manhandled the 23-year-old in the first half, but referee Stuart Attwell was unmoved.

It appeared blatant after television replays, although Dummett was able to pick himself up after being dumped on the floor to send an effort goalwards.  

Here, our reporters kept their eye on any incidents from Tuesday night's Capital One Cup fixtures.

MANCHESTER CITY VS NEWCASTLE

Evidence at last, perhaps, that even the most determined grapple tackle doesn’t always work. Just over half an hour gone at the Etihad on Wednesday night and City’s burly central defender Mangala had Dummett in a virtual headlock as a corner from the right came in. 

Referee Attwell and his assistants missed the offence – only they will know why – but Dummett managed to get off the floor in time to volley a shot in to goalkeeper Willy Caballero’s shins.

TOTTENHAM VS BRIGHTON

Mark Clattenburg was tap-dancing when Brighton defender Inigo Calderon and Spurs striker Harry Kane began grappling inside the area after ten minutes. Kane claimed he had been thrown to the deck by Calderon, who began wagging his finger in the striker’s face, and demanded a penalty. Not given.

STOKE VS SOUTHAMPTON

Despite Stoke's pre-match claims, Ryan Shawcross wasn't taken off man-marking duties and went up against Southampton danger-man Graziano Pelle at corners, even putting an arm over his shoulder at one stage. At the same time, you could sense Shawcross was more conscious of not wrestling his opponent, and both sets of players were better-behaved than usual at set-pieces.
