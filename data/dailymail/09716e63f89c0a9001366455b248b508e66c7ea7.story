Dispute: Saad Al-Hilli is reported to have kept a Taser weapon at his home and changed the locks on the doors to stop his brother from entering the property in Claygate, Surrey

A British engineer shot dead during a quadruple murder in the Alps kept an illegal Taser gun in his house where he had also changed the locks to stop his brother getting in, it emerged today.

The Taser self-defence weapon is prohibited in Britain and anyone found in possession of one can be sent to prison for up to 10 years.

Used by the British police, it fires two darts that deliver a 50,000-volt charge into victims, paralysing them temporarily.

Saad Al-Hilli, 50, was in dispute with his brother Zaid, 52, over ownership of the £1m property in Claygate, Surrey. The pair were no longer on speaking terms when he called in locksmiths, making it clear that he feared losing ownership of the house.

Shortly afterwards, on September 5th, Saad was killed alongside his dentist wife Iqbal, 47, as they sat in their BMW car close to Lake Annecy, in eastern France.

The couple died in a blaze of semi-automatic gunfire which also killed Mr Al-Hilli’s 74-year-old Swedish mother-in-law, Suhaila al-Allaf, as well as Sylvain Mollier, a passing cyclist and father-of-three.

Now Annecy prosecutor Eric Maillaud has revealed that a Taser was discovered in the Claygate house.

Detectives are trying to work out whether it was kept as a self-defence precaution against the threat of attack. ‘It could be like a woman who carries tear gas in her bag, more as a precaution than because of a specific concern,” said Mr Maillaud.

Dispute: Mr Al-Hilli and his brother Zaid were no longer on speaking terms following an argument over who owned this £1m property

On Friday a judge in Geneva – less than an hour’s drive from the crime scene – suggested that Saad had visited the city where he had access to a private bank account containing a ‘sizeable amount of cash’.

Dario Zanni, who was appointed by French investigators, is working on the theory that the bank account is linked with the murders.

While Saad was an engineer on satellite and electronics projects, Zaid works for the Burhill Group, a golf and leisure company, at its head office in Walton-on-Thames in Surrey.

The brothers became joint-registered owners of the family home in Claygate after their father, Kadhim, died in Spain last year.

A published legal document shows that Saad had attempted to block the terms of his father’s will being carried out. The wealth of the family is said to be worth many millions, with reports of properties in Spain, France and Iraq, as well as in Surrey.

Zaid al-Hilli has spoken to police on a number of occasions to deny he was in dispute with his brother. Detectives are treating him as a witness and not a suspect in the case.

Zaid Alabdi, a dentist who trained alongside Mrs Al-Hilli, has told the BBC’s The Report that he spoke to Saad the day before he headed off on holiday to France last month.

‘Saad said his brother had sacked his solicitor and he had no communication with [his brother] anymore,’ Mr Albdi told the programme, adding: ‘Since I have known Saad the only problem in his life is this recent disagreement with this brother.’

Zaid wanted the money for his share of the house, which was around half-a-million pounds, and friends also confirmed to the BBC that Saad had changed the locks of the Claygate house to stop him getting in.

Zaid has not spoken publicly about the murders, but is said to be ‘devastated’ by his brother’s death. The Al-Hilli’s four-year-old daughter, Zeena, survived the attack unscathed after hiding under her mother’s corpse, while her seven-year-old sister, Zainab, was badly injured, suffering serious head injuries and a bullet wound in a shoulder.
