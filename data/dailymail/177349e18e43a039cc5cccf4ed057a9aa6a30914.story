Inept: Grant Nanson, 21, of Sunderland, caught the crime on his mobile phone's camera by mistake

A bungling burglar who inadvertently filmed himself raiding a commercial yard on his mobile phone has been jailed after officers found the footage.

Grant Nanson, 21, of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, accidentally caught his crime on camera when he pressed record while trying to find the torch feature on his iPhone.

Nanson, who was arrested shortly after the burglary was discovered on April 14 this year, had stolen a Mini, a Vauxhall Astra and a motorcycle from the premises.

Graham O’Sullivan, prosecuting, said: ‘Police searched his home and found the iPhone, on which he had inadvertently recorded himself committing the burglary whilst trying to turn on the phone’s torch feature.'

The two cars, which were valued at £11,000, were recovered - but a motorbike that was valued at £500 was never found.

An Audi A4 was also damaged during the removal of the stolen vehicles.

Barry Robson, defending, told Newcastle Crown Court that there were probably other people involved in the offence and called it the most ‘inept’ burglary he had ever seen.

Nanson was also sentenced for a separate offence of affray, along with his father James Nanson, 42.

He was also jailed for two months for the burglary. James Nanson was given nine months for the affray, but Judge Robert Adams suspended that sentence for 18 months.
