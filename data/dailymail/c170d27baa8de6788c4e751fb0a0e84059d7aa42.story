Germany is suing one of Switzerland's largest banks for millions of Euros that went missing during the reunification of East and West Germany.

Bank Julius Bar has confirmed it is being sued for 91million Euros (£65million) by Berlin over claims a lender it took over allowed money to be withdrawn illegally.

Germany claims that Rudolfine Steindling, who was the head of East German trading company Novum from 1973, stashed charges levied against West German firms in Swiss bank accounts.

Julius Bar, one of Switzerland's largest banks, is being sued by Germany for 91million Euros it claims were illegally withdrawn as the Berlin Wall came down in 1989

After the Berlin wall fell in 1989, Germany claims Steindling withdrew cash she had no right to, and says the Swiss banks did nothing to stop her. 

The German lawsuit claims that Cantrade, a bank bought by Julius Bar in 2005, was one of the banks invloved, according toThe Local.

Spokesman Jan Vonder Mühll said shareholders had been told of the lawsuit in its last earnings report, adding: 'The bank denies the claim and has taken measures to protect its interests.' 

Vonder Muhll insisted that Switzerland's largest bank UBS, which sold Cantrade to Julius Bar, is responsible for answering the lawsuit.

Since East and West Germany were reunified in 1990, the country has launched dozens of lawsuits in various jurisdictions to try to recover money stashed by the former regime.

German lawyers have already successfully sued another Swiss bank, a branch of Bank Austria which is now part of Italy's UniCredit, for 254million Euros ($337million). 

Steindling, who died in Israel in 2012, never revealed what she had done with the money.
