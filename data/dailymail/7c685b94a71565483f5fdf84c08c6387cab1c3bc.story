Campaign: Roy West, 48, has been jailed for 14 weeks after being convicted of racially aggravated harassment

A neighbour from hell has been jailed after waging a five-year racist hate campaign against a German man living next door.

Roy West, 48, repeatedly called Bernd Kugow a 'kraut b*****d' during Basil Fawlty-like rants, as well as planting poppies in his back garden and draping a Union Flag over the neighbours' shared shed in Greater Manchester.

The campaign of abuse from West, which dates back to August 2008, led to him being sentenced to 14 weeks in prison at Tameside Magistrates' Court after he was convicted of breaching a restraining order and ignoring an earlier suspended jail term.

The former BNP candidate was also given a new, two-year restraining order. West denied any wrongdoing.

On one occasion West built a display of poppies and flags then placed it so only Mr Kugow, 51, and his British born-partner Susan Holt, 57, could see it.

Another time when Mr Kugow protested at his neighbour’s conduct, West retorted: 'F*****g kraut, get back to f*****g kraut land - remember Dunkirk?'

Jobless West was eventually given a restraining order banning him from contacting Mr Kugow and Miss Holt after he was convicted of racially aggravated harassment.

But he was arrested again after posting a rambling clip of himself on YouTube in which he holds up a DVD claiming it was 'evidence' that his neighbours had been 'spying on him' with a CCTV camera.

Police were initially called to deal with West in 2008 after he flew into an expletive-ridden rage when Mr Kugow objected to his Union Flag being draped over their joint garden shed.

Mr Kugow, a personal assistant who has lived in the UK for 23 years, and Miss Holt were preparing to go away for a week when they saw West trying to hang the flag over the shared building.

Mr Kugow went out to tell West he didn’t want it hanging over his property and threatened to take the Union Flag down himself if his neighbour left it up.

But furious West vowed to re-hang the flag on the side of his house in Dukinfield.

During a 20 minute rant West yelled: 'If you come into this f*****g garden you won’t get out alive because I’ll kill you.

'You are a ‘f*****g kraut, get back to f*****g kraut land.'

The victim later told a court hearing: 'He tried to attach the flag to the side of the house but it wouldn’t stay up and he lost his cool. It was the worst abuse that I have ever heard. He said "go back to kraut land you kraut bastard", and "remember Dunkirk".

'It carried on for about 20 minutes. He then took a Union Flag down and put a Cornish flag up and put the Union Flag out of his window outside.

'It made me feel terrible and no-one should get away with someone talking like that. It made me feel upset.

'Susan went round to his house to see how we could resolve matters. He then came round apologising and crying and brought a box of Roses for us.'

Mr Kugow added: 'I don’t think that Mr West has ever been to Dunkirk. I have lived here for a number of years and people have said funny comments and what he said about Dunkirk was fine - it was just the other words that he said.

'I wouldn’t have called the police if he had just said "remember Dunkirk". I called the police because the other things that he said.'

In 2009 West was fined £125 and ordered to pay £50 pounds compensation to Mr Kugow for harassing the couple.

But last year he was back in court after putting poppies and flags outside the victim’s property on Armistice Day - then adding to the display over the next four months.

When Miss Holt asked West to remove part of it from the shared wall last month, he replied: ‘Kraut b*****d'.

Rants: West's German neighbour and his British-born partner said the 48-year-old's behaviour had had a 'devastating' impact on their lives

Expletives: West's racist rants at his neighbour call to mind the TV character Basil Fawlty, whose deranged goose-stepping in front of German guests is one of the most famous scenes in Fawlty Towers

She told another court hearing: 'The reason the flags and poppies are facing into our garden is because Bernd is German.

'West wants to change this to make it look like we’re against the poppies and flags, which isn’t true.

'That display originally appeared on the front wall facing to the road to mark Armistice Day, which is right and proper.

'But some weeks after that it was placed on the dividing wall facing our garden.

'If you look at it from West’s garden you couldn’t see anything, it was solely for us to look at. We are private people who never wanted any of this.

'It’s had a devastating impact on our lives and we just want to get back to being private individuals. I just want the harassment to stop.' 

In May 2012 West was given a 12-month restraining order preventing him from making direct or indirect contact with Mr Kugow or Miss Holt and forbidding him mentioning or referring to them on the internet via social networking, blogging and discussion forums.

He also received a 12 month suspended sentence with a 12-week curfew. But the following November he posted a video on YouTube in which he was seen holding up a copy of a DVD which contained footage of a CCTV camera installed on Mr Kugow’s house.

Defence lawyer Ian Ridgeway said: 'Mr West has his rant on the video because he was not able to play the DVD at his earlier trial. He had fallen out with his neighbours and is not the most popular person in the area.

'He held a genuine belief that he could have his rant without specifically referring to them.'

But passing sentence District Judge Khalid Qureshi told West: 'It’s clear to me this was a deliberate breach of an order imposed to try and deal with the problem your neighbours suffered from your behaviour.

'The restraining order was entirely appropriate. It’s blatantly obvious that your behaviour amounted to a breach of that order - you caused the action so you have to take the consequences.

'While you co-operated in regard to the community aspect of the sentence, the aggravating factor is is that your behaviour was identical to the behaviour that made you the subject of the order in the first place.

'It’s clear to me that immediate custody is appropriate in the circumstances.'
