An office worker who lost 13 stone thanks to a gastric bypass says the saggy skin left by the operation makes it impossible for her to attract a boyfriend.

After ballooning to  24 stone, Leeanne Collins, 25, had a gastric bypass operation in a bid to improve her health, and lost more than half her body weight afterwards.

She was delighted to shrink from a size 28 to a size 12 – but her happiness soon faded when she was left with mounds of saggy skin which she says have utterly destroyed her confidence.

Now, Miss Collins is terrified to bare her body in front of men and is desperate for the NHS to pay for a tummy tuck so she can find love.

After the procedure, Miss Collins was left with a huge apron of saggy skin she says no amount of exercise will fix (left and right). She says the skin has ruined her confidence and is desperate for a procedure on the NHS to remove it, but her application has been turned down twice already

Miss Collins, of east London, said: 'No amount of exercise would shift my saggy tummy and I've been turned down twice by the NHS for a tummy tuck.

She said: 'I have no trouble attracting men with my clothes on but I daren't let them see my body in the buff.' 

Miss Collins has struggled with her weight since she was nine years old, when she developed a habit of secretly eating sweets and cakes.

She said: 'My mum always fed me healthy food at home but at school I ate whatever I wanted.

'Over the years it got worse and worse. I was eating crisps, sweets, cakes, fizzy drinks and chocolate in secret.'

The crunch point came when she was 16.

On a school trip, staff told her to leave a rollercoaster as she was too fat to ride it, embarrassing her in front of her whole class.

Miss Collins now weighs 11st (pictured left and right), shrinking from a size 28 to a size 12. But she says her saggy skin has ruined her confidence with men. She said: 'I have no trouble attracting men with my clothes on but I daren't let them see my body in the buff.'

Miss Collins developed sleep apnoea and asthma as a result of being obese (she is pictured, left, at 24st). Her health problems disappeared when she lost weight after the gastric bypass procedure

She said: 'I was mortified - I was sat on the ride and the safety bar couldn't close over my stomach.

'Staff made me get off, as I walked away everyone in the queue fell silent and my cheeks burned with shame.

'I was a confident person and I tried to shrug it off.

Losing weight will be the answer to many people's prayers.

But they may not realise dramatic weight loss can have a deeply distressing side-effect: excess skin.  

This hidden downside of losing weight occurs as a result of damage to the deeper layers of skin, the dermis, which contains two proteins: elastin, which helps it retract, and collagen, for strength.

When the skin is stretched too much through weight gain, these proteins tear and break, resulting in a loss of elasticity and strength.

Unfortunately, while losing weight causes the fat cells to lose their fat, the skin cannot retract.

It is linked unpleasant health problems, from infections to back pain.

Doctors say the excess skin after weight loss is the same skin damage that occurs during pregnancy — but all over the body.

Factors that affect how much skin is left include age, how quickly the weight was lost (gastric bands are slower than bypasses, for example), and, for women, the number of children she has had.

Many patients patients develop an 'apron' of skin around the abdomen, and loose skin under the arms, chest and inner thighs.

This excess skin can cause a range of medical problems.

One of the most common is intertrigo — a bacterial, fungal, or viral infection that occurs often due to the difficulty in keeping these folds of excess skin clean and dry.

Patients also find the folds of skin make it difficult to exercise. 

Excess skin is a problem particularly for people who undergo weight loss surgery.

'On the surface it seemed like my weight didn't bother me, I wouldn't listen when people called me names. But inside I was really unhappy with my body.'

In adulthood Miss Collins began suffering with asthma and sleep apnoea - a condition where the walls of the throat relax during sleep and interrupt normal breathing - because of her obesity.

Desperate to change, she applied for a gastric bypass on the NHS.

In August 2009 Miss Collins went under the knife and within a year of having the operation had lost six stone.

She said: 'It took a long time to adjust to eating less, but after a while it became normal.

'I feel fantastic now - my sleep apnea and asthma have gone. People don't realise how different your life is after a dramatic weight loss - almost nothing can stop me now.'

Before her weight loss Miss Collins would typically eat a big bowl of sugary cereal for breakfast, chicken with curry sauce and chips for lunch and a large cottage pie for dinner.

Throughout the day she would gorge on crisps, sweets and pour herself fizzy drinks.

After the gastric bypass procedure she radically changed her diet, and now eats a slice of toast for breakfast, a chicken and salad sandwich for lunch and fresh fish with steamed vegetables for dinner.

Throughout the day she snacks on fresh fruit, yogurt and crackers, drinking only water.

Within two years of having her operation, Miss Collins had shed 13 stone.

She now weighs 11 stone, and has managed to ditch her tent-like size 28 clothes for slinky size 12 dresses.

But the rapid weight loss left Miss Collins with giant folds of saggy skin.

She has applied to the NHS for a tummy tuck twice but her application has been denied both times, and her last hope is to apply for a third time this year.

The cost of such an operation from a private clinic would be around £15,000.

She said: 'I try not to let my saggy skin get me down, but I don't feel like I have my dream body yet. I feel half finished.

She says her stomach, legs and arms have lots of saggy skin which is preventing her from finding love. She said: 'I haven't been in a proper relationship since losing weight - I need to get my skin done so I can love my body'

'Both my tummy and legs have lots of really saggy skin - but no amount of exercise will shift it.

'I don't regret losing the weight, I'm so much healthier now, but I long to find love. I just don't know if I'll ever be ready to share the secret that lies beneath my clothes.

'I haven't been in a proper relationship since losing weight - I need to get my skin done so I can love my body.

'You know what they say - you need to learn to love yourself before somebody else will.

'I keep being turned down for the procedure because they want me to show that I have severe depression linked to my saggy skin. But why should I have to lie so they will fix my body?

'I've paid my tax and national insurance since I was 17 - so I've paid my way.'
