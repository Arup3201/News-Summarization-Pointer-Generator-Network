Another exhausted Central Park carriage horse has collapsed on a busy New York street - bring the total to three in just six weeks.

The horse fell to the ground late afternoon on Sunday on 59th Street and Central Park South.

The area was filled with tourists at the time, who looked shocked as the horse lay motionless.

Eye witness Mary Xanthos told MailOnline: 'I saw the horse laying on its left side for a few minutes.

'Then about six people managed to get the horse back on his feet, which also took a minute or two.

'The horse was apparently taken back to the stable.

'I just hope he'll receive a proper veterinary exam.'

Distressed: The carriage horse fell after a long day of ferrying tourists around Central Park

Another horse fell in Manhattan in early November, reigniting tensions over the horse-drawn-carriage industry.

The debate had flared two weeks earlier when a horse died, and was said to be in terrible pain. The accuracy of that was called into question when the same vet changed her statement days later, saying that animal rights groups pressured her to hint the animal was abused.

Though representatives from the Horse and Carriage industry say that the most recent incident was not caused by illness or neglect and was simply an accident, many animal rights activists are calling for the complete end of the historic industry that caters to tourists.

Traffic: The accident was on Broadway near Columbus Circle by Central Park, right in the heart of the evening traffic

The horse that tumbled Friday in Columbus
Circle, on the south west side of Central Park, is still alive after 
his hind leg got caught in the carriage shaft, causing him to hit the 
ground.

'Yet again it's another illustration of why these horses do not belong on the streets of New York City,' said Carly Knudson.

Friday night's incident comes just two weeks after another horse, named Charlie, collapsed and died on his way to Central Park on October 23.

The American Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) paid for Charlie's initial 
autopsy, and released a statement saying that the horse suffered from a 
stomach ulcer and a fractured tooth.

Outrage: Campaigners argue that the number of collisions and the suffering of the animals make the cost of the industry too high

Dr Pamela Corey, speaking on behalf of
the ASPCA, then released a statement saying that that they were 'very 
concerned that Charlie was forced to work in spite of painful maladies'.

Ms Corey has since been fired from her
job because she later released a correction, lessening the severity of 
the ASPCA's first statement, creating another drama amid the debate.

In her correction, Ms Corey tried to 
clarify that any statements saying that it was false to interpret that 
Charlie was abused. She said instead that the ulcers were common among 
working horses, and that there was no way to know if the animal was 
feeling any pain.

'I was under a lot of pressure during 
the writing of that press release and that the mistake and the need for 
the correction is the result for that pressure,' Ms Corey said in her 
second statement. She was promptly suspended without pay.

After Charlie's death, a representative 
from the Horse and Carriage Association of New York said: 'It's not 
something that happens regularly - our horses are taken care of.'

The continuation of horse drawn 
carriage has been a point of contention with animal activists for years,
though the debate truly picked up steam this year as four horses have 
fallen since late July.

Singer Pink and actresses Pamela 
Anderson and Lea Michele have worked with the group People for the 
Ethical Treatment of Animals for years and both issued statements 
condemning the practice. Ms Michele, a native New Yorker, wrote an open 
letter to Mayor Michael Bloomberg after the death of Charlie, calling 
hansom cabs dangerous.

Attention-grabber: Actress Pamela Anderson has been a longtime supporter of PETA and has posed for many of their campaigns

Mr Bloomberg has long been a supporter of the industry, saying it promotes tourism and helps the horses.

'Most of them wouldn’t have been alive if they didn’t have a job,' the Mayor said of the horses.

As an alternative, there is a city 
council bill that would replace the horse drawn carriages with 
vintage-replica electric cars. The thought is that the cars would still 
provide the economic tourism boom typically earned by the horses and be 
safer for the city's residents- both human and animal.
