Police say it is unclear if Mr Weaver is armed but it is a possibility and a high police presence remains in the Widegates and wider Looe area, including firearms officers and trained local officers.

Locals counted 15 police cars, several dog units and a helicopter hovering above the tiny rural community which has a population of just 500.

Today a neighbour said Weaver lives at Higher Widlake Farm, where he lives with his partner Karen Pengelly and her children - police said that Ms Pengelly and the children are fine.

Mother-of-one Louisa Roe, 30, said he gave her a smile and friendly wave just hours before police began searching for him.

Mrs. Roe said: 'I saw him in his truck at about 5:45pm. He waved and seemed absolutely fine.

'I know 
he's an Elvis impersonator and apparently he's quite good. He has 
slicked black hair and sideburns so he really looks the part for it.

'Him
 and his partner are tree surgeons. They often sort out the flower boxes
 in the village or cut down trees if they need to be taken down.

'They seem like a happy couple. They have dogs and ducks and chickens on their land.

'It's kind of freaky for this to happen here - it's normally so quiet.

'I hope they find him soon. He must know the area so well though.'

Mr Weaver describes himself on social media as a rock n roll singer and a professional tree surgeon who trained with the National Trust

Mr
 Weaver describes himself on social media as a rock n roll singer and a 
professional tree surgeon who trained with the National Trust.

The Elvis lookalike has recorded a string of albums including Halcyon Days, The Last Rocker and Forgotten Dreams.

A
 flyer for his music reads: 'In a just world Derrel would have been 
recognised long ago and the world of music would have been a lot richer 
for it.'

Neighbour
 Ann Chudleigh, 67, who works at Trenode Primary School as a lunch time 
supervisor and cleaner and caretaker, said: 'He's a really nice chap and
 Karen is lovely.

'He's known as Elvis - everyone calls him that.

'I've seen him when he's dressed up. He looks brilliant.

'Police are not able to share much detail at this time but can say that this is a domestic situation and it is understood one of the occupants has access to firearms,' a force spokesman said

Devon and Cornwall Police said that, as a result of the manhunt, the nearby Trenode Church of England Primary School has been closed as a precaution

'He does tape recordings of himself and when you listen to them you wouldn't know the difference.'

Mrs Chudleigh said Mr Weaver used to give free art lessons from his home for the other villagers.

She said: 'He did it voluntarily down at his place. We did watercolours and some other things, it was great.

'They're both tree surgeons and Karen does the gardening club. They've been together for a good few years.'

Devon
 and Cornwall Police said that, as a result of the manhunt, the nearby 
Trenode Church of England Primary School has been closed as a 
precaution.

'Police
 are not able to share much detail at this time but can say that this is
 a domestic situation and it is understood one of the occupants has 
access to firearms,' a force spokesman said.

'The situation is being contained and police at the scene are searching for a 60-year-old male in the vicinity.

'No further information is available at this time.'

The force said the head teacher took the decision to close the school following consultation with officers.

'This
 unusual decision has been taken as a precautionary measure for safety 
reasons and because of the ongoing police activity in that area,‚Äù the 
spokesman said.

'All members of the public are advised to avoid this area while this operation is ongoing.

'Those in the area should remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity via 999.'

The spokesman added: 'We do understand that this will cause some significant inconvenience for some parents and local residents and this decision was not taken lightly but public safety is our most important concern of the school and police.'
