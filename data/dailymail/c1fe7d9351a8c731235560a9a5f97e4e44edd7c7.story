A woman has finally achieved her dream of having children, thanks to eggs donated by her sister.

Lisa Blake, 41, spent six years and £7,000 trying to conceive as her and her partner Stephen, 37, both suffer from unexplained fertility problems.

After a fourth round of IVF failed, the couple, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, were told their chances of having a baby was less than five per cent unless they found an egg donor.

Seeing how desperate they were to become parents, Miss Blake's younger sister, Julie Wealand, 35, offered to donate her own eggs.

And finally, in December 2013, Miss Blake became pregnant. She gave birth to healthy twin baby boys Joshua and Harrison, now 8 months, in July last year.

Miss Blake said: 'I was so happy to discover that I was finally pregnant. 

'Julie has given me the best gift I could ask for, I'll be forever grateful.'

The couple's fertility problems began in 2007 after they started trying for a baby.

Miss Blake, who has been in a relationship with Stephen for 15 years, said: 'We started trying for baby when I was 34, but after two years we realised something was wrong.

'Doctors couldn't explain my fertility problems - I just couldn't get pregnant. My sister had also struggled to conceive so I knew my age wasn't to blame.

'Growing up, I always dreamed of having at least two children, and there was nothing I wanted more than to be a mum.

'My friends have kids, most from when they were younger, so I only had to attend one baby shower. But when I saw people with children, I wished it would be me.'

Aged 36, she turned to IVF treatment in an attempt to conceive.

But three agonising years and three failed IVF attempts later, the pair were still childless.

Meanwhile her sister Mrs Wealand, who lives in California with her husband, gave birth to two children of her own, conceived through IVF treatment.

Miss Blake said: 'I was truly pleased for her when she said she was pregnant. Even though she lives abroad, we're really close and I loved buying clothes for my unborn nephew.

'But I still longed for a child so Stephen and I pooled our life savings to buy a fourth round of IVF.

'Adopting would have been our final chance for children because we couldn't afford to pay for more treatments.'

But the consultant broke the news that they had just a five per cent chance of conceiving and the chances would only increase if they were to use donated eggs.

Miss Blake said: 'At first we were devastated - they didn't accept anonymous donors so we had to find someone that we knew, who would be willing to donate their eggs.

'We went to my parent's house where my sister was staying and told her what the consultant said.

'She promptly replied "You can use mine".

'I was in disbelief and giddy with excitement.'

After Mrs Wealand's generous offer, they began the long process of tests and counselling.

Her eggs were harvested and fertilised with Stephen's sperm.

A year later, Miss Blake was implanted with Mrs Wealand's eggs, but sadly, it was unsuccessful.

Miss Blake said: 'I was so disappointed when I discovered that Julie's eggs hadn't worked.

'But despite the emotional toll, I knew I had to just carry on.'

So later that year in December 2013, they tried for the final time, using Miss Wealand's embryos they'd frozen from the fourth try.

 She will now celebrate Mother's day with her sons. She said: 'I'll be forever grateful to my sister for giving me the best present ever: motherhood'

Miss Blake became pregnant two weeks later and discovered she was having twins.

She said: 'I'd taken at least 50 pregnancy tests, which were all negative, while trying to conceive from IVF, so seeing the little blue line on the pregnancy test was surreal.

'During a hospital scan, we discovered we were having twins, I was even more overjoyed.'

At 35 weeks, doctors worried that Lisa was suffering from pre-eclampsia - a dangerous condition involving high blood pressure, which affects some women in the second half of their pregnancy.

In order to minimize the risk, doctors delivered the twin babies via Caesarean section.

Miss Blake said: 'I was disappointed that I wouldn't have a natural birth, but all I cared about was the boys being healthy.

'Julie wanted to be my side when I gave birth, but only one person is allowed in the operating theatre so Stephen clutched my hand instead.

'Without her, we wouldn't have a beautiful family.'

Now eight months old, Harrison and Joshua are thriving.

Miss Blake said: 'I still can't believe I'm a mum and I can't wait to celebrate Mother's Day with the boys.

'I'll be forever grateful to my sister for giving me the best present ever: motherhood.'
