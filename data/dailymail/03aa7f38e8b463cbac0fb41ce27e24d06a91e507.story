American Idol host Ryan Seacrest plans to launch a men’s clothing line at Macy’s just in time for fall shopping.

Mr Seacrest, 39, has named his line Ryan Seacrest Distinction. It aims to offer men affordable suits with a built-in color coordination system for those that find it difficult to dress themselves.

Items will range from $45 for belts to $550 for a suit, reports The Wall Street Journal.

Mr Seacrest says that when helping design the label, he considered how many men only buy suits for a special occasion, and how their price point is often detrimental to looking good.

‘I had in mind the first time I walked into the Fox offices to audition to host. I didn’t have the means to buy an expensive suit but I wanted to look the part,’ Mr Seacrest told the paper.

The television host admits, though, that he does not consider himself a fashion designer.

‘I’m not a designer, nor do I think I am. I see an opportunity to help curate these different pieces for guys at an accessible level,’ he said.

In creating the label, Mr Seacrest was determined to only produce color ways and designs that he would wear himself.

This dedication was welcomed by the brand’s producer Randa Accessories, which long researched celebrities’ effect on menswear culture before even approaching Mr Seacrest.

According to the paper, Randa executives spent one year researching how frequently people searched the web for Mr Seacrest’s fashion in relation to other celebrities.

They considered personalities including Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon before deciding that Mr Seacrest’s influence was greater, and longer-lasting.

Macy’s will launch Ryan Seacrest Distinction in 150 of its stores by fall, and will be the line’s exclusive retailer for at least one year.

The label is accompanied by a system named ‘Style made Smart’ which manifests itself in a collection of numbered tags that adorn each garment.

The numbers, which run from one to four, help men easily discover which designs live within the same color category.

Therefore, all of the clothes in 'group one' will coordinate. Advice will be provided on which numbers can be mixed with each other as well.

Mr Seacrest, who is known for consistently wearing Burberry on-air, says that he will start to wear items from his own label while also maintaining his relationship with the English brand.

‘I’m a big fan and will continue to be. I plan to wear my line. I plan to wear [their] line,’ he said.
