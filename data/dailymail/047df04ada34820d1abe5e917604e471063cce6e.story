A convicted child molester who is one of America's most wanted sex criminals has been secretly living in London.

American Shawn Sullivan has been wanted in the U.S. since 1994 for allegedly molesting two 11-year-old girls and for having sex with an unconscious 14-year-old girl.

Sullivan, 42, was finally picked up by the Met Police last year in England. 

In December he was granted bail and must wear an electronic tag and abide by a strict curfew. He lives near Barnes in South-West London.

Minnesota state wants Sullivan extradited to face charges and a spokeswoman for Dakota County Attorney's office said they had been working with the UK to ensure he is.

If found guilty Sullivan could face up to 75 years in prison, according to The Sun newspaper.

Sullivan had gone years without showing on the radar as a fugitive from the U.S. government. During this time he lived in Ireland and was given a suspended jail sentence there for sexually attacking two 12-year-old girls.

He married an Irish woman in 1996.

It was not until 2007 that Interpol, the international police organisation, added him to its most wanted list.

Sullivan moved to England last year 
on an Irish passport and arrived undetected using the Gaelic spelling 
surname O'Suilleabhain.

U.S.
Marshals Service investigators worked with authorities in Ireland, 
Spain, Switzerland and the UK to locate Sullivan, who is originally from Fort 
Benning, Georgia.

The Home Office confirmed Sullivan's extradition was ordered in February but it is being contested by the convicted paedophile.

A spokesman said: 'On Thursday 10 February the Secretary of State signed an order for Shawn Sullivan’s extradition to the United States of America.

'Mr Sullivan has appeal to the High Court against the decisions of the District Judge and the Secretary of State; this is therefore a matter for the courts.'
