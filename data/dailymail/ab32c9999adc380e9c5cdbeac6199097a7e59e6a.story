As the sun sets on a mixed first season back at Chelsea for Jose Mourinho, the Portuguese boss will spend Monday delivering his report of the season to all-powerful owner Roman Abramovich.

Sure to be in there are pleas for a new striker, men to get rid of and some things to improve for the next campaign.

Here, Sportsmail goes inside the mind of Mourinho and imagines what’s in that dossier.

STAR MEN 

John Terry I’ve got my 'JT' back. He’s been imperious at the back, finding his best form for five years. Your No 1 mission this summer, Roman, is to sign him up for another year – at least. Why on earth was that bloke leaving him out last season? Can’t remember his name…

Eden Hazard I’ve had to tell him off in recent weeks for not following the same rules that saw Juan Mata exiled from ‘the family’ – sorry about that, by the way – but when he pays attention he’s the best I’ve got. He needs to knuckle down and shine in the big games, but don’t worry, I’ll get him into line.

Gary Cahill My most improved player. He’s been playing to a level no-one ever thought possible – that’s down to me, you know. And having JT next to him. But mostly me. He can be a future Chelsea captain.

MOVE THEM ON 

Fernando Torres I know you don’t want to hear this, Roman, but spending £50million on this fella wasn’t one of your smartest moves. It’s been four pretty awful years, it’s time to move him on. Unfortunately your generosity means no-one else is going to pay his wages.

David Luiz Barcelona are sniffing around him to the tune of £30m, and I wouldn’t mind getting my hands on that. Usurped by Cahill in defence, he turns up for the big games in midfield but is all-too-often a liability by switching off against the small fry. I’ll miss his tongue-sticking-out Instagram photos, though.

Ramires You know I love a runner, but you need to be able to pass the ball as well – Ramires often has to be reminded that we play in blue. He’s also been suspended about as many times as Vinnie Jones in his heyday. Hmm… I wonder if Vin fancies a return to Stamford Bridge?

Farewell, Fernando: It's time for Chelsea to cut their losses and ditch the misfiring Torres for good

I WANT 

Diego Costa In case you haven’t noticed, I’ve been hinting all year that we might, just possibly, need a striker. If you’ve tuned in to La Liga at any point this season, you’ll probably have seen the Atletico Madrid man make defenders break out into cold sweats. I saw your face after his team knocked us out of the Champions League – we’ll both be smiling next year.

Thibaut Courtois You’ll like this, Roman – you won’t even have to buy him! He’s one of your most valuable toys and someone else has been playing with him for three years. Let’s not break the news to Petr just yet, but I liked what I saw in the Champions League.

A striker. Any striker at all. Mandzukic, Cavani, Ameobi… anyone will do. I know I’ve already said Costa, but we need another. I don’t fancy that big fella from Belgium that seems to come back every summer, and Samuel Eto’o is busy applying for his bus pass.

NEW SEASON RESOLUTIONS 

1 I’ll leave the bus in the car park. Everyone’s been telling me you want this attacking football malarkey, so I promise I’ll give it another go. I can’t guarantee I won’t batten down the hatches when the going gets tough, but get me a couple of strikers and watch us go…

2 I’ll keep my trap shut. Frankly, it’s getting a bit expensive paying the FA thousands of pounds every time I speak about referees, so I’m going to keep my thoughts to myself. Probably.

Wind-up: Mourinho got the better of Liverpool but still finished below Steven Gerrard's team in the table

Heart felt: Mourinho will make his pleas to Chelsea's all-powerful owner for changes this summer

3 I’ll win a trophy. History tells me you’re not a big fan of managers without silverware and I couldn’t bear to move again after settling back in London.

4 I’ll beat some teams in the bottom half. I know you enjoyed beating Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City this year. If only we could use that expertise to beat the might of Aston Villa, Sunderland and Norwich we might be really on to something.

Full of hot air: Jose Mourinho grabs a balloon on the touchline during the final game of the season at Cardiff

5 I’ll smile a bit more. Having said I was the 'Happy One’ when I came back, I’ve had a bit of a sense of humour failure in the last few weeks. Let me borrow the yacht, buy me a couple of strikers and I’ll be like the Cheshire Cat again.
