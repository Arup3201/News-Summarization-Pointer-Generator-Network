The supermarket price war has driven down inflation to a four a half year low, official figures revealed this morning.

Falling prices at the pump and grocery price cuts saw inflation drop to 1.5 per cent last month.

It means CPI inflation has been below its target of 2 per cent for eight months in a row - the longest such run since 2005.

The 'Consumer Price Index' measures inflation by tracking the price of an ordinary basket of everyday consumer goods - but does not include housing costs. It has been  below 2 per cent for eight months

The figure may ease pressure on the Bank of England to hike interest rates which have been at the historic low of 0.5 per cent for more than five years.

Chancellor George Osborne tweeted: ‘Good news inflation has fallen again to just 1.5 per cent, below the 2 per cent target. But people still feeling impact of the Great Recession, so more to do.’

Chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander added: ‘Today's inflation figures are another step on the long road to our economic recovery after the great crash of 2008.’

But Labour shadow Treasury minister Catherine McKinnell said: ‘While this fall in the rate of inflation is welcome, the squeeze on working people continues.’

‘The most recent figures show pay rising by a record low of just 0.6 per cent - less than half the rate of inflation. Wages after inflation have now fallen by over £1,600 a year under this Government.’

IHS Global Insight chief UK economist Howard Archer said August's muted CPI inflation figure was welcome news for consumers' purchasing power as they continue to be hampered by low earnings growth.

Discount supermarkets like Aldi have eaten into the established giants' share of the market, helping to drive down the price of a weekly shop

He pointed out that inflation of 1.5 per cent in August was still more than double current underlying earnings growth of just 0.6 per cent in the three months to June.

IHS Global Insight expects the Bank to raise interest rates to 0.75 per cent from 0.5 per cent in February, but added low inflation meant there was a growing possibility this could be delayed until the second quarter of next year.

Mr Archer added: ‘An interest rate hike would highly likely be delayed if the Scots vote for independence on Thursday and there are signs that the economy is being adversely affected in the uncertain aftermath.’

Samuel Tombs, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said stable energy bills, lower import prices and weak wage growth will enable inflation to fall to as low as 1 per cent by the end of this year and remain weak in 2015.

He said: ‘Although the low inflation outlook is unlikely to prevent the Bank's monetary policy committee from raising interest rates entirely over the next couple of years, it should limit the speed at which they rise.’

Food and drink prices fell by 0.2 per cent between July and August and are now 1.1 per cent lower than a year earlier - the biggest figure since June 2002.

There was also downward pressure on the prices of furniture and household equipment.

These falls offset rises among clothing and footwear, which jumped by 2.6 per cent between July and August. Alcohol and tobacco also rose 1 per cent between the same period.

Today's data showed the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation, which includes housing costs, also fell to 2.4 per cent from 2.5 per cent.
