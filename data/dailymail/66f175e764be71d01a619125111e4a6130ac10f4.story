Michael Jackson's ex-wife Debbie Rowe broke down when describing her recent relationship with her daughter Paris.

Taking the stand for a second day at Jackson's unlawful death trial, Rowe
said she had been in daily touch with the teen until she had to be 
hospitalized on June 5, when paramedics were summoned to the Jackson 
family home in Calabasas to attend to the 15-year-old.

Rowe was asked how Jackson's death had affected his only daughter.

Getting close: Debbie Rowe has grown close to her daughter Paris, who she is seen with in May, in recent months but says she hasn't seen her since Paris 'tried to kill herself' in June

'She
is devastated,' Rowe said. 'She tried to kill herself. She is 
devastated. She has no life. She doesn't feel she has a life anymore.'

Jackson family representatives 
have not provided an update or publicly classified her hospitalization 
as a suicide attempt. Jurors have heard from her older brother, Prince, 
but have only seen Paris through a couple clips of her deposition and 
have heard references to her struggling with her father's death.

Rowe also acknowledged on Thursday that she was concerned that some of his frequent medical visits were motivated more by a desire for drugs than by the treatments he received.

Debbie Rowe testified during the trial of a lawsuit that she told Jackson about her concerns when he would go to his longtime dermatologist more than once a week in the 1980s and early 1990s.

Rowe worked in the office of the dermatologist, Dr. Arnold Klein.

'I
didn't understand why he would come in twice in one week,' Rowe said, 
adding that she was concerned he might be in search of drugs rather than
treatments for blemishes with collagen injections. 'I didn't 
necessarily see what he wanted to have done.'

Rowe
has offered a conflicting portrait of Jackson's medical treatments 
during her testimony, saying earlier that she never saw him engage in 
doctor shopping or request specific pain medications. She said many of 
the visits were legitimately tied to treatments for the skin-lightening 
condition vitiligo and scars he sustained after being burned during a 
Pepsi commercial shoot.

Rowe,
clutching a tissue and breaking down at times, described Jackson as 
suffering debilitating pain throughout the nearly 20 years that the pair
were close friends.

She said her husband trusted his doctors and depended on them to give him proper medications.

She said her husband trusted his doctors and depended on them to give him proper medications.

'When it came to the pain ... it was more begging for relief than anything,' Rowe said.

'He respected doctors so he wouldn't question what they were doing.'

Rowe
is the mother of the singer's two oldest children, Prince and Paris 
Jackson. She and the pop star were married from 1996 to 1999.

She
is testifying in a lawsuit filed by Jackson's mother against AEG Live 
LLC, the promoter of Jackson's ill-fated This Is It comeback concerts.

Rowe
hugged Katherine Jackson and held her hand during a break in testimony.
Rowe was called to the witness stand by AEG Live attorneys but told the
jury on Wednesday that she was not testifying for either side and 
wouldn't have come to court if she hadn't received a subpoena.

Lawsuit: Jackson's mother Katherine is claiming AEG Live failed to properly investigate Dr. Conrad Murray

Jackson's
scalp was badly burned when his hair caught on fire while filming a 
1984 Pepsi commercial. The injuries left his scalp with painful scarring
that required surgeries and injections of medications to try to lessen 
the pain and repair the damage.

Rowe
said the injuries as well as the effects of vitiligo left Jackson 
feeling like he was disfigured. The singer was forced to wear wigs and 
de-pigment his skin and struggled to deal with the effects while in the 
public eye.

On another 
matter, Rowe said Jackson was devastated by his divorce from Lisa Marie 
Presley and because he didn't have any children. Rowe said she told him 
they should have a baby together.

By
that time, she and Jackson had been friends for more than a decade, 
with Rowe holding the singer's hand as he received injections for 
numerous medical procedures and talking with him several times a week.

'I
wanted him to be a father,' she said. 'I wanted him to have everything 
he didn't have growing up. I wanted him to experience it with his own 
child, with his own children.'

Katherine
Jackson claims in her lawsuit that AEG Live failed to properly 
investigate the doctor later convicted of giving her son an overdose of 
the anesthetic propofol while he prepared for a series of comeback shows
in 2009.

AEG denies it hired Conrad Murray or bears any responsibility for the singer's death.

Marvin
S. Putnam, the company's lead defense attorney, said in opening 
statements that the case was about Jackson's personal choices and his 
desire to use propofol as a sleep aid.
