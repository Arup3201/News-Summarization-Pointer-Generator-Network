Sam Vokes is hoping to make up for lost time after rediscovering his scoring touch for Burnley.

The striker made his second appearance following nine months out with a ruptured cruciate ligament as the Clarets took on Tottenham in the third round of the FA Cup.

Vokes came off the bench with half an hour to go and converted Michael Kightly's cross in the 73rd minute to earn Burnley a 1-1 draw and a replay at White Hart Lane next week.

Vokes was making his second appearance after nine months out with a serious cruciate injury

It was the 25-year-old's first goal since a penalty in a 2-0 victory over Doncaster on March 25.

Four days later, Vokes suffered the injury early in a match against Leicester, but the 21 goals he had already scored played a major role in Burnley's promotion.

He made a brief comeback on Boxing Day against Liverpool but had to endure more frustration because of illness.

That was all forgotten as the ball flew past Spurs goalkeeper Michel Vorm, and Vokes is now hoping to make his mark in the Premier League.

The Welshman said: 'It puts nine months' work into perspective. It was a great feeling to get back out there and score.

'I was a bit gutted over the Christmas period. I got on against Liverpool and then picked up a chest infection. I've only had a couple of sessions since the illness and it's knocked me back a little bit.

'It was great work by Kights down the right-hand side. I saw he was heading to the byline, he pulled it back and it fell right to me so it was nice.

'There was a lot of emotion. The lads were great. They all came over and congratulated me and there were a few nice comments afterwards. It does mean a lot.

'You go through some hard times mentally and physically in the gym and when you're stuck on the sofa, but it's nice to come out the other side and hopefully I can kick on now.'

There was a bittersweet tang to Vokes' achievement, though, after the news his team-mate Kevin Long had suffered the same injury.

The defender had played just 20 minutes of Premier League football when he landed awkwardly during Burnley's 3-3 draw at Newcastle last week.

It was announced on Tuesday that Long had signed a new contract keeping him at Burnley until 2017, and Vokes will do all he can to help on the long road ahead.

'I wouldn't wish that injury on anyone,' said Vokes. 'It's horrible. And when you get that phone call, I remember where I was, and it's not nice.

'I spoke to him the night he got the news, talked him through it. It's a tough one to take.

'But it's a strange kind of mentality because you get your head round it as soon as you get the information, it's going to be a nine-month thing, and then you try to crack on. I think he's heading down for the op this week and I wish him all the best.

'Fifteen or 20 years ago you'd be lucky to get back out on the pitch. You look for inspirational stories and there's a lot out there now.'

With Burnley's squad depleted by injuries and Tottenham facing two games a week for the rest of January, a replay was probably the last thing either team wanted.

But boss Mauricio Pochettino insisted the prize of a fourth-round tie against Leicester is one that Spurs will give their all to secure.

Of his side's hectic fixture list, the Argentinian said: 'I am not concerned. I'm confident in our squad. All our players are in good physical condition.

'It's true that I am a little bit disappointed because we need to play another game. But this is football.

'I think we need to stay in the FA Cup and get to the next round. It's important. Our priority is to stay in all the competitions and to be competitive.'
