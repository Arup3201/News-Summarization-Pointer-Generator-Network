The California family of a five-year-old boy left paralyzed from the neck down by a car accident are rallying support so they can win a custom-made minivan for his wheelchair.

Zakk Smith suffered a severe form of whiplash that, in effect, decapitated him internally, when his uncle's car was hit by elderly driver who had run a red light.

But despite his disabilities, the space-mad youngster who dreams of visiting the Hollywood  observatory, has not lost his adventurous spirit.

On the move: Zakk and his mother Arlay are trying to win a van that his wheelchair will fit in

The injuries from the car crash he was in when he was three were so severe that doctors had even suggested to his mother, Arlay Galindo, that she should turn off his Zakk's life support.

But Ms Galindo refused to give up on her son who despite being left quadriplegic is always smiling.

The curious five-year-old loves to get out as much as possible and enjoys kindergarten, but the van the family were using to transport his wheelchair has broken down.

The family are campaigning to get extra votes for Zakk in the hope he will win a custom-made disability minivan being given away for Mobility Awareness Month.

On Zakk's competition profile, where people can click to vote for him once a day, his family say: 'Even though Zakk's life will no longer be the same as that of a "normal" five-year-old, his spirit and enthusiasm for life no one can deny.'

Creative: Zakk enjoys painting and has learned to make pictures by holding a brush in his mouth

They added that Zakk has 'an uncanny vibrant spirit for life' and greets his mom each morning with a smile and says: 'Today is a new day.'

And while he may not be able to move around, Zakk still loves to sing and chat, and is able to paint pictures using a pencil or brush held in his mouth.

He has come a long way since the accident, when a driver hit the car he was in at 50pmh, stretching his spinal cord in what is known as 'super whiplash'.

Ms Galindo told ABC News doctors said his 
injuries were 'much worse than [the late actor] Christopher Reeve,' and were uncertain he would survive.

But Zakk pulled through. his mother said, adding: He is perfectly normal despite a traumatic brain injury ... he speaks clearly and sings.'

The youngster is also bright, and loves learning about the planets. His mom says if they win one of the four vans being given away they want to take him to the Griffith Observatory in Hollywood.

Anyone can vote for Zakk. Those with the highest number of votes by May 9 go through to the second round of the contest, when a panel of judges will review their stories.
