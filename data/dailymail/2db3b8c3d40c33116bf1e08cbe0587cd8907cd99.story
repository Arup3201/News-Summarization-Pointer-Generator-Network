Their World Cups could not have been any more contrasting - Spain surrendered their crown by bombing out in the group stages while Germany went all the way, beating Argentina in the Maracana final.

Four months on, ahead of their friendly in Vigo, we assess what's happened to both nations since the summer and whether they've progressed or gone backwards.

THE RESULTS

SPAIN

Spain fell to their first qualification defeat in eight years when they lost to Slovakia last month and coming after a miserable 1-0 loss to France in a friendly straight after the World Cup the gloom has taken a time to lift. 

But beating Luxembourg 4-0 and Belarus 3-0 in their last two games have restored faith that while things will never be quite the same again, Spain can go into France 2016 as one of the favourites for the tournament. 

Much of the renewed excitement comes from the performance of Isco in that last game.

GERMANY

After the euphoric high of winning the World Cup out in Brazil, a hangover was always to be expected and so it has proved.

Argentina, who were beaten by Mario Gotze's extra time goal in the final, gained a small measure of revenge when they won 4-2 in a Dusseldorf friendly back in August. Germany trailed 4-0 at one stage, with Angel Di Maria in exceptional form.

Qualifying for the European Championships started in a similarly unconvincing vein as they scraped past Scotland 2-1 thanks to a couple of Thomas Muller goals before a few shortcomings were exposed in a 2-0 loss to Poland.

Low was left fuming after John O'Shea's stoppage time goal earned the Republic of Ireland a point in their third qualifier and there were still a few murmurings of discontent when Germany 'only' put four past minnows Gibraltar the other night.

MANAGER

SPAIN

Vicente del Bosque kept his job after a World Cup campaign that he himself described as disastrous. Now he has to prove that he is the best man to help Spain to defend the European crown they won under his management in 2012. 

He is fiercely loyal by nature so there has been a tendency toward evolution over revolution but slowly but surely the new Spain is taking shape.

In France 2016 he, along with the likes of Iker Casillas, Andres Iniesta and David Silva want a glorious swan-song that will erase memories of that Brazil nightmare.

GERMANY

Germany's triumph out in Brazil was a glorious vindication of Joachim Low's philosophy and methods, but the manager has been frustrated by the fall in standards since.

Low, a perfectionist, has seen his team affected by somewhat inevitable lapses in concentration since their Maracana win and restoring professional focus is his No 1 priority.

The expanded format for Euro 2016 hasn't helped his cause, with Germany pretty much assured of qualification whatever they do. It must be a massive comedown to play these routine qualifiers after the high-pressure games of the World Cup.

The World Cup-winning squad have naturally assumed a huge celebrity profile - as shown by the red carpet premiere of 'Die Mannschaft', a film about their Brazil triumph, in Berlin this week - and Low's greatest challenge now is to ensure they keep their minds on the football.

PLAYERS

SPAIN 

It was Del Bosque who persuaded Diego Costa to switch allegiance; the Brazilian born striker has not made it easy for his manager since then. 

First he failed to score at the World Cup, then having taken a total of 515 minutes to get off the mark he pulls out of the next squad, despite being fit to play for Chelsea against Liverpool. 

For now Del Bosque is sticking with the idea of building the team around him with young talents such as Real Madrid’s Isco and Valencia’s Paco Alcacer in a supporting role. Atletico Madrid’s Koke also has a huge role having been handed the ‘Xavi baton’ in midfield.

GERMANY

There were always going to be some players wanting to end their international careers on a high and stalwarts Philipp Lahm, Per Mertesacker and Miroslav Klose all announced their retirements.

Bastian Schweinsteiger, appointed Lahm's successor as captain, has been on the sidelines with a knee injury and has only just returned to training with Bayern Munich.

But though these pillars of the side have been absent, Germany are not exactly short of world class talent and Low has started to bring a few new players through.

With Mats Hummels injured at the start of the season, his Borussia Dortmund clubmate Matthias Ginter has been deployed and left-back Erik Durm, also of Dortmund, has been given his chance too.

Christoph Kramer, who started the World Cup final after Sami Khedira's injury only to be himself taken off with a head injury, has added to his caps.

Low has also used Hoffenheim midfielder Sebastian Rudy and has great faith in Bayer Leverkusen winger Karim Bellarabi, who has started the last three qualifiers.

Other more established names have been ineffective, including the out-of-luck Lukas Podolski and Max Kruse, both of whom failed to get on the scoresheet against Gibraltar.

THE FUTURE

SPAIN

Going into the next big tournament with David De Gea or Iker Casillas in goal; Real Madrid’s Dani Carvajal and Barcelona’s Jordi Alba at full-backs; and Gerard Pique alongside Sergio Ramos in the centre of defence should give the Spanish a solid base on which to build. 

Sergi Busquets and Koke look set to become the new midfield pairing with Diego Costa leading the line in attack. 

And in the line of three behind the striker Del Bosque still has enough players for two teams with with Isco, Paco Alcacer, Pedro, Andres Iniesta, David Silva and Cesc Fabregas all available to him. 

It’s still a squad to envy and if the right balance can be found between the old and the new France 2016 could yet belong to the Spanish.

GERMANY 

With an eye on the future, Low is set to promote under-21 captain and Hoffenheim striker Kevin Volland, and Stuttgart defender Antonio Rudiger for the Spain match.

Germany's talent pool runs deep and if the big names continue to mis-fire, there are plenty ready to pounce and take their place.

Some changes for the match in Vigo have been forced, with Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng and Marco Reus all out.

However, Low has been far from satisfied with some of the contributions of his fringe players and demanded they step it up in a blast after the Gibraltar match.

The whole team still seems to be struggling with the return to the mundane day job after their World Cup glory and Low needs to inspire them again.
