An Iranian official has said reaching a deal with the West over its nuclear programme by tomorrow is 'impossible'.

The official said the discussion may soon have to shift from trying to reach an agreement to extending negotiations past tomorrow's deadline for the end of this round of negotiations.

Western powers had hoped the talks in Vienna could open the door to ending economic sanctions on Iran, an energy-rich nation of 76million people, after decades of hostility with the West.

But sources have now confirmed what officials close to the talks have been predicting privately for weeks: that a final deal is still too far off to hammer out by the deadline.

'Considering the short time left until the deadline and number of issues that needed to be discussed and resolved, it is impossible to reach a final and comprehensive deal by Nov. 24,' Iran's ISNA news agency quoted an unidentified member of the country's negotiating team in Vienna as saying.

'The issue of extension of the talks is an option on the table and we will start discussing it if no deal is reached by Sunday night,' the official said.

A European official who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity said: 'To reach a comprehensive deal seems physically impossible. Even if we were to get a political agreement the technical annexes are not ready.'

A European source said on Saturday there was no decision yet on extending the talks: 'It's the ministers' decision, but talks on an extension could begin Sunday or Monday,' he said.

Iranian and Western diplomats close to the negotiations have been telling Reuters for weeks the two sides remained deadlocked on the key issues of Iran's uranium enrichment capacity and the pace of lifting sanctions.

The Iranian official quoted by ISNA said the sides 'were trying to reach a framework accord on major issues like ... the number of centrifuges, enrichment capacity and the timeframe of lifting sanctions.'

The U.S., UK, France, Germany, Russia and China began the final round of talks with Iran on Tuesday to clinch a pact under which Tehran would curb its nuclear work in exchange for lifting economic sanctions.

'The meeting between Zarif, Kerry and Ashton was good,' an unidentified Iranian official was quoted as saying by another Iranian news agency, IRNA.

'However, we still have a lot to work on and it is too early for the final judgement.'

The talks aim to end Western suspicions that Iran is seeking an atomic bomb capability, while allowing Iran to have the civilian nuclear programme it says is its right under international treaties.

In a breakthrough preliminary deal reached a year ago, the U.S. and European Union agreed to ease some sanctions on Iran while Tehran agreed to some curbs on its nuclear programmes. But a final deal has proved elusive.

Sanctions, tightened sharply since 2010, are inflicting severe damage to Iran's economy, while the U.S. and its ally Israel have said they reserve the right to use force to destroy any Iranian nuclear bomb programme.

Washington would also have to win acceptance from regional allies Israel, which already has nuclear weapons, and Saudi Arabia, both avowed enemies of Iran. Kerry briefed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone on Saturday and Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal in person at the Vienna airport today.

'Iran must not be allowed to set itself up as a nuclear threshold state,' Mr Netanyahu said about his conversation.

'There is no reason for it to retain thousands of centrifuges which would allow it to enrich uranium for a nuclear bomb in a short period of time.'

Officials say an extension of the talks could last from several weeks to several months. Neither side wants negotiations to collapse, but Western officials are afraid extending talks again could make it harder to get a final deal.

A section of the Tehran Research Reactor: Iran's nuclear programme first began in the 1950s with the help of the U.S. 

Iran's secret nuclear programme was revealed in 2002, when an opposition group leaked details of a uranium enrichment plant at Natanz and a heavy-water reactor at Arak.

The government subsequently agreed to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), but the watchdog ruled it was unable to confirm Iran's claims that its nuclear programme was for purely civilian purposes.

Enriched uranium can be used for civilian purposes, but if the concentration of the active uranium isotope is 90 per cent or above it can also be used to build nuclear bombs. And a by-product of the nuclear process in heavy water reactors is plutonium, another material useful for making an atom bomb.

Ironically enough, Iran's first nuclear programme was launched with aid from the U.S. in the 1950s as part of the Atoms For Peace programme. It was severely hampered after the 1979 Islamic Revolution when international cooperation from Western nuclear powers was all but withdrawn.

At the same time the first Ayatollah, Ruhollah Khomeini, disbanded a clandestine research programme because he considered it forbidden under Muslim ethics.

Throughout the 80s and 90s Iran's nuclear programme operated in fits and starts with help from Pakistan, China, Argentina and Russia, but continuing opposition from the U.S. IAEA officials visited Iranian nuclear sites and reported that all their observations were consistent with peaceful use of atomic energy.

Nevertheless, rumours persisted that the Islamic Republic was seeking to build an atom bomb, suspicions which came to a head when the secret enrichment plant was publicly revealed in 2002.

Since then, at the instigation of the IAEA and Western powers, the UN Security Council has passed eight resolutions on Iran, demanding it suspend its uranium enrichment activities.

The IAEA has consistently stated it is unable to conclude that Iran's nuclear program is entirely peaceful.

Although the Iranian airforce is a hotch potch of various aircraft from all over the world, including the U.S., it is not known to have any strategic-type bombers.

However the country has a number of ballistic missiles in service and in development, as well as a space programme that, in a similar way to the U.S.-Russia Cold War space race, could provide it with dual-use rocket technologies.

The Shahab 2 and 3 missiles currently operational have a range of up to 2,000km with payloads of 1,200kg and 990kg respectively, making them potent enough to strike Israel and other regional rivals such as Saudi Arabia.

Iran also has 12 X-55 long range cruise missiles purchased without nuclear warheads from Ukraine in 2001. They can fly up to 3,000km to their targets.

The country's most advanced missile, the Fajr-3, has an unknown range but is estimated to be 2,500 km. The missile is radar evading and can strike targets simultaneously using multiple warheads, but has a payload of only 800kg.
