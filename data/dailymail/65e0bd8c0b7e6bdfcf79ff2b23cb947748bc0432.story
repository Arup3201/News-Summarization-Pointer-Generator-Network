A passenger on board a Jet Airways flight opened the emergency exit and leapt onto the tarmac in a worrying security breach at Mumbai Airport in India.

Jet Airways' Chandigarh to Mumbai flight 9W469 had landed around five minutes earlier before a man, who has been named locally as Akash Jain, sprang into action.

He is reported to have opened the emergency exit in the middle of the plane, and jumped 15 feet down onto the tarmac.

Worryingly, he was directed to the terminal by a staff member working on another flight. He then made his way into the terminal and out of the airport.

Mid-day have reported that Jain jumped off the plane at around 3.05pm, and by 3.16pm he was caught on CCTV leaving the airport.

Shocked passengers alerted Jet Airways staff on board, but by the time they had reached the exit Jain was walking to the terminal. 

Investigations are ongoing as to how the passenger managed to exit Mumbai Airport after leaving the plane

Speaking to Indian news site Mid-day, airport officials have reacted with anger as to why it took Jet Airways staff 35 minutes to notify security.

A spokesperson said: 'If the incident took place after the aircraft landed, why didn't the airline security staff inform the security agencies immediately?'

'Why did they need 35 minutes to do so?'

The police's Airport Division have confirmed they are investigating the matter, and are still trying to trace the whereabouts of the 30-year-old man. 

The plane, a Boeing 737 flight had 144 passengers and five crew members on board.

A spokesperson for Jet Airways told MailOnline Travel: 'A guest travelling on Jet Airways flight 9W 469 from Chandigarh to Mumbai opened the emergency door and disembarked alighting onto the aircraft's wings after the aircraft had come to a standstill at the parking bay at Mumbai airport. 

'Security agencies were immediately alerted and are carrying out further investigations.'
