Police in Scotland called on sportswear giant Adidas to help them trace the model of a distinctive trainer which may have been worn by a serial sex attacker.

Foot impressions taken from two crime scenes in Livingston, West Lothian, were sent to the company’s German headquarters as they believe the suspect was wearing their brand.

The firm identified the footwear as £55 Adidas Adipure Essence which has given investigators a vital clue in tracing the predator who struck twice in just over a month.

Now officers are tracing all shoppers who bought the trainers by credit or debit card in or around Livingston town centre.

Detective Superintendent Pat Campbell, who is leading the inquiry, said: 'We recovered foot impressions from the crime scenes and reached out to Adidas for help identifying the model of the trainers.

'We were informed they were specialist tennis shoes and we’re now working to determine how many were imported into the UK and where they were sold.

'We are asking the public to think of neighbours, friends or relatives who match the description and have these distinctive trainers.

'Maybe they have been acting strangely in the last few months.

'Perhaps they are shift workers and would be out early in the morning.'

In the first incident, a 21-year-old woman was attacked in the garden of her home in Scott Brae at about 5.20am on April 8.

The man had been hiding in the bushes but she managed to fight him off and he ran into nearby woods.

Five weeks later in the early hours of May 7, a second woman was indecently assaulted by the same man when he broke into her flat.

The 27-year-old was left traumatised when she woke to find him in her bedroom.

Police believe the man may have been injured during the first attack when the woman fought back and have said he may have a scratch on his back and an injury to his little finger.

Last month, an e-fit image of the man police wish to trace in connection with the attacks was released.

The suspect is described as white, around 5ft 8in to 5ft 10in with dark hair, wearing a grey hooded top and the Adidas trainers.

Det Supt Campbell said: 'The man in the e-fit could be the suspect or someone totally unconnected.

'We still want to trace this person to eliminate him from the inquiry.'

Police are continuing to mount high-visibility patrols across Livingston, particularly in the Eliburn and Ladywell areas.

Anyone with information is asked to call Police Scotland on 101 or the charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
