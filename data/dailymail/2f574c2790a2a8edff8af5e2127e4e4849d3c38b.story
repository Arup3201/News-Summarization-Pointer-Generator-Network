Upset: Stewart Rahr took issue with how he was treated at Nobu57 in Manhattan

One of the world's richest men has been banned from top New York restaurant Nobu after the staff said that he allegedly threatened to kill the manager when he didn't get his favorite table.

Stewart Rahr, a pharmaceutical billionaire who boasts of his celebrity friends and his lavish lifestyle, reportedly sent a email of complaint to Nobu owner Drew Nieporent.

Rahr admits having a disagreement with a female manager but he denies threatening to kill her after she ignored his phone call, according to The New York Post.

The paper reports that after the face-to-face confrontation with the manager, he sent a caps-locked tirade to Nieporent, he cc'ed a group of his famous friends including Mark Wahlberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alicia Keys, Andre Agassi and Joaquin Phoenix.

Three additional recipients have some political pull, including police commissioner Ray Kelly, Rahr's 'buddy' Donald Trump, and actor Robert DeNiro who co-owns the restaurant chain with Nieporent.

The dispute stems from an incident where the 66-year-old allegedly got into a verbal altercation with the restaurant's manager Sharon Hofstetter when Rahr tried to get his favorite table on the night of his wife's surprise birthday party.

He reportedly walked up to an occupied table and asked the group who was dining there to move so that he could have 'his' table.

A bartender told the paper that the group refused and he offered to pay their bill if they would agree.

Rahr, who calls himself 'Stewie Rah Rah- the No. 1 King of Fun', then left an irate message for Hofstetter, who was not at the restaurant at the time of the interaction.

She did not call him back immediately so he went to the restaurant on 57th Street to have it out with her in person.Â 

'He called me the c-word and said he would kill me,' Hofstetter told The Post.

Rahr tells a different version of the story. He told The Post that Hofstetter was supposed to meet him at his office to plan the party in question, so he went to the restaurant to give her a piece of his mind.

'I told her "I can't stand you. You're despicable." Did I curse at her or threaten to kill her? No true- please. I would never say that,' Rahr told the paper.

Feeling like his message may not be clear, Rahr decided to send the email to Nieporent and copy his A-list pals.

'I GUESS THAT U R MUCH TOO BUSY TO 
CALL BACK AN UPSET CUSTOMER. I HAD TOLD U THAT I HAD A MAJOR PROBLEM 
& A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE EXPERIENCE CONCERNING A SURPRISE PARTY FOR A 
VERY VERY CLOSE FRIEND THIS PAST WEDS,' he wrote in the email.

Rahr,
 who owned drug manufacturer Kinray until he sold it for $1.3billion in 
2010, went on to talk about his wealth in the email, using it as an 
unexpected way to rub his business savvy in Nieporent's face.

'I
 HAD ONLY 3 employees & revenues of only $40,000... WHEN I RECENTLY 
SOLD MY company last year I EMPLOYED almost 2,000 employees n REVENUES 
of $5,000,000,000 (thats what 5 BILLION (W AN 'B' AS IN BOY NOT AN 'M' 
AS IN MAN...' he wrote in the angry- and typo-laden- email.

Banned: Now Rahr is no longer welcome at any of Nobu's 25 locations around the world

Now, Rahr is no longer welcome at any of the 25 international Nobu locations. Given his propensity to go heavy on the self tanner (having had a skin cancer scare several years ago) and trademark uniform of purple t-shirts and yellow Ray Ban sunglasses, it would be easy to spot him if he tried to sneak in.

This is far from the first time that Rahr has used his connections to make a point, as he was described in a New York Observer profile of showing off his hundreds of posed photos with various celebrities.

And he has no problem expressing his distaste for others: he openly bad-mouthed Tiger Woods, calling him 'the most selfish guy I know out of the 500 celebrities on this wall', and had a PR back-and-forth over a slight to comedian George Lopez.
