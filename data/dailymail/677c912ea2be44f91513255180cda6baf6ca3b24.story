Accused: Chicago receiver Sam Hurd

Chicago Bears wide receiver Sam Hurd has been arrested after allegedly trying to buy over a pound of cocaine.

The 26-year-old NFL star was held in an undercover drug operation by Homeland Security as he left a restaurant after dining on a $300 fillet mignon steak.

Police suspect he is one of the top dealers in Chicago and reportedly have a list of players they claim he supplied with illegal drugs.

The list is 'in  the double-digits,'  unnamed law enforcement sources told the radio station 670 The Score.

Hurd will be in federal custody until today while prosecutors and defense attorneys work out bail details before he is sent to Texas to face charges.

“Sam intends to fight these charges, and 
we intend to defend him fully... we have complete confidence in him,' said attorney David Kenner, who successfully defended rapper Snoop
 Dogg against a murder charge.

Hurd, in handcuffs, declined to comment on the charges, but when he was asked before the hearing if he was still a member of the Bears, he said: 'As far as I know.'

According to the criminal complaint, Hurd met an undercover agent at Morton’s steak restaurant near Chicago's O'Hare airport.

He allegedly told the agent that he was interested in buying five to 10 kilograms of cocaine and 1,000 pounds of marijuana weekly to distribute in the Chicago area.

The agent claimed Hurd said that he and another person were already distributing approximately four kilos of cocaine weekly, but needed a new supplier that could meet their demand.

While his partner handled most of their drug deals, Hurd allegedly told the agent he was responsible for the 'higher-end deals.'

Hurd left the meeting with the 
undercover officer after he agreed to pay $25,000 for each kilo of 
cocaine and $450 per pound of marijuana.

He said that he could pay for a kilo of cocaine after 'he gets out of practice.'

The player then walked out of the restaurant and was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers as he stashed the bag of cocaine in his vehicle.

Kathy Colvin, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney in Dallas, told ABC News that she 'cannot confirm or deny' allegations that Hurd sold drugs to other NFL players.

But she added that It was possible these charges could come up later.

Hurd spent five seasons with the Dallas Cowboys before signing a $5.15 million three-year deal with the Bears in July.

Bears Coach Lovie Smith said he was disappointed by the arrest, and described it as 'total surprise.'
