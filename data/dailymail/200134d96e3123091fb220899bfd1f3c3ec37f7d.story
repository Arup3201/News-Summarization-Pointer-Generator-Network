Veteran defender Carlos Salcido was the biggest surprise in Mexico's 23-man World Cup team announced Friday by coach Miguel Herrera.

It was the first call-up for Salcido since Herrera took over as Mexico coach late last year. Salcido was on Mexico's team for the 2006 and 2010 World Cups.

Herrera left off two big names - goalkeeper Moises Munoz, who played for Herrera when he coached Club America, and midfielder Javier Aquino of Spain's Villarreal.

Mexico almost missed out on a sixth consecutive World Cup, needing a two-game playoff with New Zealand to qualify. It faces tough competitions in Group A with games against Brazil, Croatia and Cameroon.

Defenders: Andres Guardado (Bayer Leverkusen), Paul Aguilar, Francisco Rodriguez, Miguel Layun (all America), Hector Moreno (Espanyol), Rafael Marquez (Leon), Diego Reyes (Porto), Carlos Salcido (UANL Tigres)

Midfielders: Hector Herrera (Porto), Jose Juan Vazquez, Carlos Pena, Luis Montes (all Leon), Juan Carlos Medina (America), Isaac Brizuela, Marco Fabian (both Cruz Azul)

Forwards: Oribe Peralta (Santos Laguna), Javier Hernandez (Manchester United), Raul Jimenez (America), Giovani Dos Santos (Villarreal), Alan Pulido (UANL Tigres)
