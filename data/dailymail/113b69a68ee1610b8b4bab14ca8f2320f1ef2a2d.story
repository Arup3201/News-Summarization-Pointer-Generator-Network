Beardilizer aims to give folically-challenged men a boost, promising to boost facial hair growth through its mix of nutrients and vitamins

Never mind balding treatments - now there's a 'fertiliser' which promises to boost beard growth.

The supplement, called Beardilizer, is aimed at follically-challenged men desperate to grow facial hair but struggling to achieve anything more than stubble.

The product claims to promote the growth of facial hair by stimulating follicles, resulting in a thicker, more luscious beard to match those sported by George Clooney, Brad Pitt, David Beckham, Ben Affleck and Superman actor Henry Cavill.

It was launched after it became fashionable to have a beard - and it has been such a hit that around 1,000 bottles are apparently flying off the shelves every day.

Beardilizer is made from a blend of vitamins and minerals that its makers claim nourish facial hair follicles.

Users are recommended a dosage of three capsules a day for between one month and six months.

A one-month course of the supplement, which is made entirely from natural products, costs £28.90 and can be bought in the UK online.

The product was the idea of Laurent Cohen, whose Florida-based company has been making health and beauty products for 12 years.

Mr Cohen, 42, said: 'We have been in the health and beauty business since 2002 and we are always looking for new, innovative products.

'In the past few years having a beard has become very cool and we noticed there wasn't anything on the market to help those who struggle to grow one.

'In 2011 we started working on a formula for a supplement to stimulate beard growth.

Beardilizer contains a range of vitamins and nutrients that are known to promote hair growth.

Vitamin C boosts collagen production, which surrounds the hair strands, protecting hair from breaking.

Biotin is a water soluble vitamin of the B complex which promotes hair and scalp health.

Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) helps the body produce keratin - a protein in the hair.

Vitamin A is needed by the body to create sebum, an oily substance created by our sebaceous glands to provide a natural conditioner for a healthy scalp.

'Facial hair follicles are different to hair follicles on your head and if you nourish them with good nutrients you can get brilliant results.

'You can't fight genetics, and Beardilizer is not like a magic wand you can wave and grow a beard overnight.

'But after four weeks of taking it you will definitely start to see results, and after two or three months you will be very happy indeed.

'Beardilizer is made from totally natural ingredients.

'We stand by its quality and there have been some great results. The feedback has been tremendous.

'Sadly it doesn't work the same on head hair, otherwise I'd be a millionaire by now!'
