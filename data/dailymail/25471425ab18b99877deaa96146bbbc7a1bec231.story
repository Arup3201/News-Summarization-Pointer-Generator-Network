Caitlin Hartley was barely a day old when doctors told her parents she would need major heart surgery if she was to survive past three months.

She had four operations during which her heart stopped beating for three minutes and she suffered a collapsed lung. But she fought back each time and now 16 months on her parents say she is a 'bundle of energy.'

Caitlin's transformation was partly thanks to a pioneering procedure during which surgeons replaced a faulty artery in her heart with a cow’s jugular vein.

Bundle of joy: Caitlin Hartley with her parents Marie and Steven. The 16-month-old has undergone four heart operations already

Her parent's Marie and Steven, who live in Edinburgh, were full of praise for their plucky daughter.

‘Caitlin is amazing,’ Mrs Hartley, 32, said.

‘She bounces back so quickly. She’s never been in hospital more than ten days after surgery.

'You’re always conscious, if she gets a cold or seems a bit off, that it could be something to do with her heart – but she is such a bundle of energy and we have to stay positive.’

The couple’s ordeal began the day after Caitlin was born at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on September 20, 2011, when tests revealed she had a heart murmur.

They found out she had a condition called truncus arteriosus, which affects fewer than one in 10,000 babies.

Instead of two arteries leaving the left and right sides of the heart, Caitlin had a single, large one – sending too much blood to the lungs.

In October 2011 she had a cow's jugular vein fitted at Yorkhill Children's Hospital in Glasgow, but the surgery ran into complications.

‘We were devastated,’ Mrs Hartley recalled.

‘We
just cried and cried. During her first keyhole surgery her heart 
stopped for three minutes. They couldn’t get it restarted so they had to
give her adrenaline and shock her.'

Epic run: Caitlin's father plans to run 2,013km, which is equivalent to 48 marathons in 2013

In February 2012 Caitlin went back in to have a stent fitted to reduce the pressure on her heart, but impressed her parents with her fighting spirit.

‘Caitlin never lets anything keep her down,' her mother said.

'After the second operation, she was taken to intensive care but the first night she ripped out all her lines, took herself off the ventilator and wanted to eat yoghurt.’

Caitlin also suffered a collapsed lung but again she pulled through and was out of hospital within seven days.

Mrs Hartley said: ‘She likes to keep us on our toes.’

A second open heart operation came in August 2012 and in October she had three further stents put in.

Now Mr Hartley, 35, has pledged to run 2,013km in 2013 to raise £10,000 – to be matched by his employer Standard Life – for the children's hospital that has saved Caitlin's life so many times.

So far, he has signed up to eight marathons, half marathons and 10ks around the country to help him hit the target. Since January 1st he has managed to run 188km (117miles) - the equivalent of four and a half maratons.

‘To look at her, you wouldn’t think she has gone through all that she has, the way she dances and runs around the house,’ he said.

‘All you can say to the doctors and nurses is thank  you, but it never feels enough.’
