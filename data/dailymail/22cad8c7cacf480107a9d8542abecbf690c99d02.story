The Archbishop of Canterbury should never expressed regret over the British bombing of Dresden – because it helped save 'thousands' of lives, an MP has said.

Sir Gerald Howarth, a former defence minister, said the RAF attacks 70 years ago helped shorten the War.

The Most Rev Justin Welby was criticised on Friday for telling an audience in the German city of his 'profound feeling of regret and deep sorrow' at the bombings, which killed thousands.

And BBC coverage of Friday's 70th anniversary commemoration also came in for criticism for including a prisoner of war who claimed the UK had been 'worse than' the Nazis.

The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby should never expressed regret over the British bombing of Dresden, an MP has said

Last night it emerged that 54 people had contacted the Corporation to complain about the coverage.

On Friday, Archbishop Welby said the bombing of Dresden, which killed an estimated 25,000, 'diminished all our humanity'.

But he made no reference to the 53,573 British aircrew killed in the struggle to overthrow Hitler, nor to the German bombing of London or Coventry.

On the Radio 4 Today programme yesterday, Tory MP and former defence minister Sir Gerald said Mr Welby should have made it clear it was wrong to apologise for Dresden.

'This is a very sensitive issue indeed and has been for the last 70 years,' he said.

'I am a big admirer of Archbishop Justin Welby, but I do think here it came across – and we have to be careful how we measure our words – it came across like he was more sensitive to the Germans than he was to the sacrifice of 56,000 members of Bomber Command.

He said the bombing raids on Dresden (pictured), which killed an estimated 25,000, ‘diminished all our humanity’

'When he said 'I stand here among you with a profound feeling of regret and deep sorrow', it was in the sense that one felt he was on the verge of apologising.

'When he did a Radio 5 interview subsequently, he was asked 'Should we apologise?', to which he replied: 'I think it is more complicated than should we apologise'.

'I'm very sorry that the Archbishop, for whom I do have a lot of time, did not seize that opportunity to say I was not apologising nor should we apologise.

'It was a brutal war. The bombing of Dresden undoubtedly brought the War to an end sooner than would otherwise have been the case, and unquestionably saved thousands – possibly hundreds of thousands – of lives.'

Nick Baines, the Bishop of Leeds, said on the same programme that when he read the text of the Archbishop's speech that it did not 'come across' like an apology.

'Whatever the moral judgement about the right or wrongness of the firestorms and the bombing raid, this caused terrible devastation, and to acknowledge that is not to diminish the price that other people paid.

'The Archbishop did not apologise for what went on.'

The BBC's coverage of the commemorations was condemned as disgraceful by RAF veterans and MPs. One British prisoner of war was interviewed, saying the raids were 'demonic' and 'evil'.

Last night a spokesman for the BBC said: 'Last Friday the Dresden commemorations were watched by more than 15 million people on BBC TV news – with many millions also listening on radio or viewing online; and 54 people complained.'

The Archbishop said it was ‘miraculous’ Dresden (aftermath of bombing pictured) was welcoming him given the ‘brutal and devastating’ nature of the attack
