A paralyzed dog found dragging himself through the streets of Mexico begging for food has been given another chance at life.

The emaciated boxer-bulldog mix was rescued earlier this year by a woman who named him 'Thor' for his sheer will to live. His hind legs were useless, he was covered with parasites and was starved of love and sustenance.

When the woman known only as Eva posted his picture on Facebook begging for help, Los Angeles-based rescue service The Mutt Scouts took Thor in.

Now, with the help of donors, the precious pooch has gained weight, overcome his deadly infections and is learning to walk again.

'He was literally covered in hundreds of ticks, so by the time he got here, the kid was not doing very well at all,' Mutt Scouts's JF Pryor told KTLA.com.

'We’ve learned…about humility, tenacity, kindness and just the joy of the moment from this kid.'

Although rescuers are overwhelmed by Thor's affection and determination to live, his treatment - documented in YouTube clips - has been demanding and intensive.

'The ENTIRE Team - alongside his three doctors - will negotiate this boy through these next weeks, months, whatever is needed,' The Mutt Scouts wrote on their Facebook page.

'As
 we get him Stronger, tend to his wounds, his malnutrition, rid him of 
parasites, understand who he is, address his every need, introduce him 
daily to movement via his Hot Wheels....and Ready Him for his 
specialist.'

Thor has undergone major medical treatment in Southern California, including at Echo Park Vet Hospital, as well as laser surgery, massage therapy and acupuncture treatments. 

He is also being re-trained to walk at Two Hands Four Paws, making use of the underwater treadmill to build up his rear-end strength and gain confidence walking. 

'As the tank began to fill with water, he glanced at us with a 'What did you sign me up for?' look,' The Mutt Scouts wrote on their Facebook page.

'Once the treadmill started - and his thoughtful tech started to re-introduce him to a normal walking pattern - Thor started easing into this wet exercise.

'One has to figure this was the first time he had been in this much water, and as his uncertainty subsided, his normal 'up for anything' self, emerged.

Today, he has a wheelchair, known as his 'Hot Wheels'.

However The Mutt Scout's acknowledge that Thor's recovery is a 'work-in-progress' and it could take several months to determine how far the pooch's healing can go.
