When it comes to a cup of London tea you'll be lucky to grab one for much less than £2.50, however, one extravagant blend has just raised the bar when it comes to an overpriced brew.

The prestigious Royal China Club on London's affluent Baker Street has just launched the world's most expensive brew, setting you back no less than £180 a pot.

The pricey tea is created from the leaves of the Da Honh Pao (Imperial Red Robe) that are treated much like a fine wine as they are left to mature to gain flavour for 80 years before being served.

Pricey pot: The Da Honh Pao tea at the Royal China Club will set you back no less than £180

Although a tea that costs the same price as a small computer may seem a little unreasonable the legendary Oolong artisan leaves earn their price through rarity, as they can only be harvested on certain days of the year.

The tea also has royal endorsement, dating as far 
back as the early 18th century, during the Qing Dynasty, when the 
emperor Da Hong Pao was titled 'King of Tea' due to his love of the 
beverage.

Due to its high quality, Da Hong Pao tea is usually reserved 
for honored guests in China.

Served at exactly 95°c in the Royal China Club, the tea is handmade from tender leaves, withered, tumbled, curled and baked in small batches over charcoal to create an aromatic infusion with distinctive dark cocoa notes, a toasted fruity flavour and a long smooth aftertaste that lingers for several minutes after consumed.

The tea was said to be enjoyed by the emperor Da Hong Pao during the Qing Dynasty

Peter Chan the sommelier at the Royal China Club says that brewing the tea at such a specfic temparature is not a gimmick but a necessity.

'Making tea is not simple – it is an art
 form when you are using tea leaves as prized and delicate as Da Honh 
Pao. It has to be brewed and served at exact temperatures - too hot or 
cold and you risk killing the flavours.

He continues, 'Tea masters from Hong Kong visit
 the Royal China restaurants in London every couple of years to train 
all staff in the art of artisan tea making.'

The unique blend of tea is served at exactly 95°c to ensure the perfect flavour balance

Peter adds that maturing the leaves for so long adds a great depth of flavour to the tea.

'The tea leaves of Da Honh Pao are left to mature and gain 
flavour for 80 years before being served. This helps to create the 
unique flavor which is highly respected by tea connoisseurs around the 
world.'

He adds that this particular blend has an almost completely authentic taste.

'Like all teas, Da Hong Pao is now 
processed and sold in many different grades, with some high grades reportedly as expensive as gold! These days, most Da Hong Pao on the 
market is produced from clippings of the original bushes, resulting in 
similar grades and tastes to the original.'

Despite the hard work and craftsmanship that has gone into the tea the Royal China Club understand that not all tea lovers can quite stretch to the price of the cuppa.

The Club also offers a range of 18 different types of artisan teas from various regions in China, starting from £4.80 for two.

The Royal China Club restaurant on Baker Street is renowned as one of the most authentic Chinese restaurants in London.

The restaurant is part of The Royal China Group, consisting of six restaurants.

All the restaurants offer traditional Hong Kong Chinese dishes, while the Royal China Club combines European ingredients with the authentic Chinese cuisine. 

The group is renowned for its dim sum, which includes steamed seafood dumplings with spicy sauce and pan-fried fillet of duck breast rolls.

Designed by Stiff + Trevillion, a large aquarium containing lobsters, crabs, fish and seafood creates a focal point.

Gordon Ramsay is a huge fan of Royal China Club, and when he was filming a slot on 'how to make dim sum' for the F word, Royal China Club was his location of choice for filming.
