David Weir produced the fastest wheelchair mile in history — and has been tipped to go faster still by Sir Roger Bannister, a man who knows a thing or two about milestones.

Sir Roger was at the top of The Mall in London to present Weir with his medal after he had crossed the line outside Buckingham Palace in 3min 7sec.

That was two seconds faster than the time he set on the same route a year ago but short of the three-minute barrier he had targeted to mark the official 60th anniversary of the first sub-four-minute mile run by Sir Roger.

‘It was wonderful to see him get so close, said Sir Roger. ‘I think he’ll do it next year.’

Weir, who was also cheered on by Mo Farah, duly retained his British Athletics men’s wheelchair road mile title, beating Japan’s Kota Hokinoue by 22 seconds, and vowed to be back next year to launch another attack on the three-minute barrier.

‘I gave it my best shot and I wasn’t too far off,’ said Weir, who clinched the fourth of his quartet of London 2012 Paralympic gold medals when he won the wheelchair marathon on these same streets two years ago.

Agonising: Weir broke the world record but just failed to go under the three-minute mark in Westminster

‘It was such an honour to meet Sir Roger and it would have been great to have broken three minutes in front of him.

I’ll be back next year to give it another go.’
