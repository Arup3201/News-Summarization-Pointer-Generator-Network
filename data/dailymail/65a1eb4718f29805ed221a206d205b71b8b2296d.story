Sitting on a wooden stool often ends in a sore bottom but this cleverly designed one is as soft as a cushion despite being made entirely out of wood.

The Ash Cushion needs no stuffing to make it soft because it is made of strips of notched ashwood, creating a solid yet springy surface.

The $2,199 (£1,370) handmade stool, designed by Mary Dickerson, compresses when under pressure.

Soft as a cushion: The Ash Cushion is deceptively soft because it is made of strips of notched wood which compress under pressure

The 19x12x18inch stool is extra wide and based on Dutch designer Carolien Laro’s work, Spring Wood Collections, which cleverly pushed the limits of wood.

Ms Laro developed a collection of stools and three-seater benches in 2010 and won the Wood Challenge Prize and was nominated for the IMI Award and the DOEN material prize.

Nice notches: The strips of ashwood have had pieces sliced out of it, allowing it to bend and compress unlike solid pieces of wood

Ash wood is often used by carpenters and designers because of its versatile physical properties including its strength and flexibility.

Ms Dickerson's design comes as a team of Swiss designers have developed a rocking chair that can transform energy from its rocking motion to charge an iPad or iPhone.

Built according to the classic, proven 
rocking chair design, the seat - which its makers have dubbed the iRock -
uses a built-in generator that transforms gentle swaying into 
electricity.

Handcrafted from Swedish pine, it is styled with all the traditional features you would expect from a rocking chair but also comes equipped with an iPad stand.

The backrest of the painted wood 
rocking chair also features built-in speakers, presumably to pelt out 
Radio 3 or Vera Lynn videos from YouTube.

Its makers claim that just an hour of
easy swaying will charge your iPad to 35 per cent, and it is also 
compatible with other Apple devices - although publicity pictures 
suggest it uses the old-style connector.

The chair uses a winding mechanism 
combined with a set of gears to create enough force to drive the 
generator, which the development team says was a challenge to make 
energy efficient enough for practical use.

iRock: This rocking chair which charges your iPad as you use it is the brainchild of a Swiss design team

Perfect for the older iFan: The owner's iPad rests conveniently on a stand built in to the chair's armrest
