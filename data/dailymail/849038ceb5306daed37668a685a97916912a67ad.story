A family doctor is being investigated after it emerged an elderly patient of his changed her will days before her death to leave his daughter a share of her £560,000-plus estate.

Lucie Rose, 87, killed herself with an overdose of pills which her  sister said had been prescribed by her GP, Dr Chittaranjan Pillai.

Nine days earlier she altered her will to state that her late husband's car and the couple's £250,000 bungalow should go to the 63-year-old GP's daughter Sharnika, who friends believe Mrs Rose had never met.

Yesterday her relatives said she could
 not have been of sound mind when she changed the will and insisted she 
must have fallen  victim to 'criminal acts'.

Mrs
 Rose, who had no children, died in November 2010. She had lost her 
husband John, 86, to cancer 11 days before she altered the will.

She
 had originally planned to leave everything to her two sisters in 
Germany, the couple's only  surviving relatives. But yesterday the 
youngest sister, Elke Schmaing, said she had been stunned to hear the 
house and car had gone to the GP's daughter.

Much
 of the rest of the cash – in the region of £300,000 – was left to 
another individual. Money was also left to four charities, but Mrs 
Rose's sisters Anneliese Keller and Mrs Schmaing were left just a watch 
and some jewellery.

Mrs 
Schmaing accused police of failing to investigate the matter properly. 
She claimed the fact that her sister's suicide note was  written in 
English was suspicious because she 'still spoke and wrote in German'.

Mrs
 Schmaing even suggested that she did not think her sister would have 
taken her own life in the way alleged. Although she acknowledged that 
her sister had spoken about taking her life after the death of her 
husband, a former salesman, she said her sister had planned to go 
'somewhere like  Dignitas in Switzerland – not by taking pills on her 
own'.

Nottinghamshire Police
 – who had lost the suicide note by the time of Mrs Rose's inquest – 
have already been criticised by a coroner over the 'shoddiness' of their
 investigation into the death.

Mrs
 Schmaing, 69, speaking from her home in the spa town of Bad Iburg near 
Osnabruck, told the Daily Mail that she and Mrs Keller, 75, had spent 
three years trying to find out why the will was changed.

She
 said: 'We were very close and I would ring Lucie almost every day. This
 is not the sort of thing she would do. I feel there have been criminal 
acts carried out here.

'She 
was confused before she died. She told me a financial adviser was trying
 to make her make a new will. Her will was completely changed days 
before she died and was drawn up by a different solicitor to the 
original will she had.'

A 
friend of the Roses, who did not wish to be named, also held suspicions 
about the suicide note. The friend said it was written on expensive 
writing paper, but Mrs Rose was notoriously frugal and would not have 
bought such paper.

The change in the will meant that her doctor's daughter received Mrs Rose's £250,000 bungalow

NHS 
England is investigating the doctor's connection to the will and his 
surgery's 'medicine management' in relation to Mrs Rose.

She
 met her husband when he was stationed in Germany during the Second 
World War. They moved back to his home city of Nottingham in 1949.

At
 an inquest in November 2011, Nottinghamshire coroner Mairin Casey 
recorded a verdict of suicide but said 'there may well have been a 
suggestion' the Roses were 'vulnerable to influence from an outside 
third party'.

Elke Schmaing, pictured with her sister Mrs Rose, is challenging the will because she does not believe her sister was of sound mind when she signed it

Mrs Rose and her husband were treated at Plains View Surgery in Mapperley, Nottinghamshire, for many years

But she agreed
 with professionals – including Dr Pillai – who had considered Mrs Rose 
to be of sound mind when she made the new will.

The
 pensioner was on medication for what is thought to have been a heart 
condition when she died.  Dr Pillai, known as Chit, is based at Plains 
View Surgery in the Mapperley area of Nottingham. His Nottingham-born 
wife Ann, 47, is understood to be the practice  manager. Sharnika, 23, 
is listed amongst the administrative staff.

The family live in upmarket Lowdham, Nottinghamshire. There was no answer at their extended cottage yesterday.

NHS
 England said an investigation into aspects of Mrs Rose's  case was 
ongoing. In a statement Dr Pillai said the surgery had 'engaged fully 
with the NHS  England investigation'.

Sharon
 Quinn, 54, the sister of Dr Pillai's wife, said: 'This is unbelievable.
 Sharnika is a lovely girl. It is very sad what has happened but Chit is
 the last person to take advantage of someone.'

A
 spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said: 'We have investigated every 
aspect of this inquiry. There was no evidence to suggest any criminal 
activity and the case was closed.'
