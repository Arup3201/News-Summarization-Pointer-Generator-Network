Ladies, has your other half taken to shopping solo at Waitrose? Gents, is the woman in your life popping to Sainsbury’s a lot?

Then it seems you may have cause to worry about your relationship.

A survey has examined the shopping habits of those who are considering an extra-marital affair.

It found that the number one supermarket for such men is Waitrose, while for women it is Sainsbury’s. Tesco, Asda and the Co-op also featured prominently.

The survey of those seeking love amid the chiller cabinets and vegetable displays was conducted by a dating website.

Both sexes agreed that Iceland was the store where they were least likely to seek a new flame.

Dating website IllicitEncounters.com quizzed their 800,000 members to find out more about their shopping and cheating habits.

Mike Taylor, a spokesman for the website said the choice of supermarket reflects the kind of bed mate the cheating spouses are after.

He said: 'Men see Waitrose as the quality 
choice for food shopping, whilst women see Sainsbury's as an ideal 
combination of both quality and value for money.'

The survey also found that what shoppers buy at the supermarket can vary depending on their romantic intentions.

Those polled who had started an extra-marital relationship admitted to eating 
healthier and spending more money on supermarket 'best' ranges of food.

Thus Mr Taylor said what is in your partner's shopping trolley can be a 'dead giveaway' of whether they are, or intend to, cheat.

The survey revealed that members 
who had started an extra-marital relationship said they ate more 
healthily and spent more money on supermarket ‘best’ ranges of food.

He said: 'Becoming more concerned with one's health and diet is often a dead giveaway for an affair, shopping for healthier or buying organic food can indicate a new relationship and a keenness to take extra care of yourself.

'We all want to look and feel our best when meeting someone new as we are viewed in a totally different light by this person; it's a chance to reboot ourselves and start a-fresh.'

He added: 'This is as much about a change of routine as it is health driven. Trying new foods and breaking eating habits is intrinsically linked to a change of mind-set when deciding to start an affair.'
