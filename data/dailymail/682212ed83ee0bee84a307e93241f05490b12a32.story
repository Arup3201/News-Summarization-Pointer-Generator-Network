Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions singled out Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday for taking jobs away from American workers and giving them to immigrants to drive down his company's costs.

Sessions, a Republican who is known for his fierce opposition to amnesty for illegal immigrants, railed on the Senate floor against Zuckerberg and other Democrats backing executive action by the president and legislation authored by the Gang of Eight that would increase the number of guest worker permits.

'The “masters of the universe” are very fond of open borders as long as these open borders don’t extend to their gated compounds and fenced-off estates,' he claimed at one point, according to National Review Online, which reprinted a version of his speech.

Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, a Republican who is staunchly opposed to amnesty for illegal immigrants, took to the Senate floor on Wednesday to attack Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his allies over their support for immigration reform policies that Sessions says would rob American workers of job opportunties

The crux of Sessions' argument was that it's unnecessary to increase the number of temporary work visas, particularly for the purposes of filling information and technology positions, because there's a plethora of jobless Americans who could fill those voids.

The Republican Senator targeted Zuckerberg because he is the founder of a Silicon Valley based non-profit organization that lobbies the government to make reforms to the immigration system. 

The goals of FWD.us include getting the government to provide a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants who currently reside in the U.S. and to allowing skilled workers to jump to the front of the immigration line.

Reports that the president could grant work permits to up to six million illegal immigrants this fall has Sessions especially riled up about the influence that special interests could have on the White House's decision.

'The administration is meeting with the elite, the cosmopolitan set, who scorn and mock the concerns of everyday Americans who are concerned about their schools, jobs, wages, communities, and hospitals,' Sessions said.

'These great and powerful citizens of the world don’t care much about old-fashioned things like national boundaries, national sovereignty, and immigration control — let alone the constitutional separation of powers.'

In his rant against Zuckerberg and his allies, Sessions claimed they were pushing the White House to issues executive orders that admit foreign workers to the U.S. 'for the explicit purpose of taking jobs in the United States.' 

'Many of us have heard for a long time the claim that there is a shortage of STEM [science, technology, energy and math] and IT workers,' Sessions said. 

'This has been the central sales pitch used by those making demands for massive increases in foreign-worker programs across the board — programs that bring in workers for every sector in the U.S. economy.

'But we know from the nation’s leading academics, people who studied this issue and are professionals in it,' he said.

Sessions proceeded to read from a July op-ed published in USA Today in which five professors of public policy from five universities assert that they've been unable 'to find any credible evidence' that there's a shortage of workers in those fields.

'Imagine, then, how many more Americans would be frozen out of the middle class if politicians and tech moguls succeeded in doubling or tripling the flow of guest workers into STEM occupations,' the op-ed states.

Sessions offered up the op-ed as proof that tech companies like Facebook and Microsoft are using the H-1B visa program' to keep wages down and to hire less expensive workers from abroad.'

'Indeed, the same companies demanding more guest workers are laying off American workers in droves,' he said, referring to Microsoft's decision to lay off 18,000 workers.

'So I would pose a question to Mr. Zuckerberg. I read in the news that Facebook is now worth more than $200 billion. Is that not enough money to hire American workers for a change?' he said a few minutes later.

'Let me just say one more thing: Facebook has 7,000 workers . . .Why doesn’t Mr. Zuckerberg call his friend Mr. Gates and say: Look, I have to hire a few hundred people; do you have any résumés you can send over here? Maybe I will not have to take somebody from a foreign country for a job an unemployed U.S. citizen might take.'

Gates is also a founder FWD.us. 

Sessions pointed out that several other large technology companies, including Hewlett-Packard, Cisco, United Technologies and T-Mobile, have also had massive lay-offs in the last two years.

'There is no shortage of workers,' he concluded.

The president, he said, has already acted unilaterally to expand the work visa program this year by 100,000 more people. Meanwhile, real median hourly wages have declined by 3.4 percent since 2009.

'So what about the good, decent, and patriotic citizens of our country who fight our wars, who obey our laws, who follow our rules, and want a better future for their children? Should their needs not come first?' Sessions asked.

'We cannot put the parochial demands of a few powerful CEOs ahead of an entire nation’s hopes, dreams, and aspirations,' he added.

'The job of elected officials is to answer to the people who sent them to Washington — not to scorn them, not to demean them, not to mock them, and not to sell their jobs and dreams to the highest bidder.'

The Senate has already passed the White House approved Gang of Eight legislation, proposed by four Republicans and four Democrats. That legislation stalled in the House more than a year ago. 

The House has since passed legislation that would bar President Barack Obama from using executive orders to give amnesty to illegal immigrants but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has refused to bring the legislation to the floor in the upper chamber.

On Wednesday Sessions encouraged his fellow Senators to 'stand up' to Reid and the president, 

'This body is not run by one man. We don’t have a dictator in the great Senate. Every member has a vote,' he said.
