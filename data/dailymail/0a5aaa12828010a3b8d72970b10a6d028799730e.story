Located 28miles from London Waterloo and with its own train station taking commuters directly into the capital within 50minutes, it has become an exceptionally popular destination for commuters forced out of the London property. 

The average home in East Horsley, which has a private sports club, decent schools and nearby riding schools and golf courses, now sells for £1,006,304, property experts Savills said.

Property listings show numerous homes listed for sale for more than £1million, many featuring sprawling lawns, open plan kitchens and huge double garages. 

Sophie Chick, associate director at Savills, said that the cost of housing in cities and towns means that villages now offer comparatively good value for money.

‘We’ve actually found that since the credit crunch, villages on the whole have underperformed their neighbouring towns and cities,’ she said. 

‘This is because there has been a marked preference for living within an urban environment, closer to a work place, resulting in affluent UK cities and towns outperforming their neighbouring villages and rural locations in the housing market.

‘This means villages now represent good value and there is a currently good buying opportunity.’

Inside, it boasts of oak doors and staircases and claims to be an original Frank Chown build, created in 1923

Other locations topping Savills’ rich villages list include Bowdon, part of the ‘footballer-belt’ of affluent properties circling Greater Manchester, where 27 property deals topped £1 million. Nearby Alderley Edge also features.

The village – 12 miles from Manchester – is where David and Victoria Beckham first settled down.

Other Manchester United stars including Rio Ferdinand, Michael Carrick and Cristiano Ronaldo have also called it home.

The 100 most affluent villages in Britain are scattered across the regions – from Brockenhurst, nestled in the heart of Hampshire’s New Forest, to the Cornish holiday hotspot of St Mawes.

Homes in the West Midlands, Somerset and Cheshire also feature in the rankings.

But millionaire city dwellers in search of comfortable country living have ensured that villages within the London commuter belt – especially those with a handy railway station – dominate the list. 

This includes Chorleywood in Hertfordshire, officially Britain’s second most exclusive village, where 34 homes have been sold for more than £1 million since 2013.
