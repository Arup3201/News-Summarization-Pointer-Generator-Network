A Bank of England employee has been suspended over claims the regulator knew that traders were trying to rig currency exchange rates, it emerged today.

The UK's central bank has launched an inquiry into how much officials knew about the alleged manipulation of markets by city traders.

It announced today that one member of staff had been suspended from their job pending further investigation.

The decision comes after Bank officials examined 15,000 emails, 40 hours of telephone conversations and 21,000 instant messages sent and received by its workers.

Probe: The Bank of England has suspended an employee over allegations of exchange rate fixing

The investigation was prompted by a claim from a currency trader that Bank officials had told him that it was OK to share information with rival banks while setting key exchange rate benchmarks.

The officials allegedly told him they had no policy on colluding to set rates, and that banks were free to make their own rules.

In a statement today, the Bank said: 'It is a matter of public record that the Bank of England has been conducting an internal review into allegations that Bank of England officials condoned or were informed of manipulation in the foreign exchange market or the sharing of confidential client information.

'This extensive review of documents, emails and other records has to date found no evidence that Bank of England staff colluded in any way in manipulating the foreign exchange market or in sharing confidential client information.

'However, the Bank requires its staff to follow rigorous internal control processes and has today suspended a member of staff, pending investigation by the Bank into compliance with those processes.'

Traders: Bankers are alleged to have worked together to fix exchange rates of foreign currencies

The statement continued: 'No decision has been taken on disciplinary action against any member of Bank staff.

'The Bank continues to support the Financial Conduct Authority's investigation into the foreign exchange market. In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate for the Bank to make any further comment on this matter.'

More than a dozen banks have launched investigations into allegations that their traders deliberately rigged foreign exchange markets to benefit their own trades.

The scandal comes in the wake of the international outcry over Libor rigging, which has seen banks pay out billions of pounds in fines after it emerged that daily interest rates were routinely being manipulated.

Experts said that it was vital for the Bank of England to prove that none of its staff were involved with the efforts to rig exchange rates.

'Alarm bells should be ringing when a central bank suspends staff in connection with market rigging,' said Simon Morris of law firm CMS.

'While we don't yet know the details, the inference must be that he or she turned a blind eye to market rigging or, even worse, was leaking rate-setting plans to the market.'
