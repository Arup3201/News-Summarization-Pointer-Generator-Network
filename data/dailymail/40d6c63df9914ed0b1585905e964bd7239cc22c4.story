A bride who pretended to have terminal cancer so she could scam money for a lavish wedding reception and honeymoon will face felony charges over the deception.

Jessica Vega, 25, from New York, even fooled her husband to-be that she was dying from leukaemia, telling him she had less than a year to live.

Vega was taken into custody last week and pleaded not guilty to five counts of grand larceny and one count of scheme to defraud. She was currently being held in Orange County Jail, New York on $10,000 bail.

State attorney general Eric Schneiderman told the Times Herald-Record: 'By pretending to have a terminal illness, Vega inexcusably took advantage of the community's hearts and minds, and profited off of their generosity.

'Our office will hold this individual accountable for fleecing the public through lies and deception.'

Vega married Michael O'Connell, the father of her one-year-old daughter Lily, on May 2, 2010 and the couple spent an exotic honeymoon in Aruba using donated plane tickets and a villa.

The reception was attended by 60 family and friends who had all give money to the tragic cause along with many strangers who read about Vega's plight in their town newspaper in Newburgh, around 75 miles from New York City.

Friends donated everything from her dress to a two-week honeymoon in the
 Caribbean so that the then 23-year-old could enjoy a happy start to married 
life before succumbing to the disease.

She reportedly received thousands of dollars and wedding presents. 

Four months later, O'Connell revealed that Vega had been faking the illness and he had been duped into marrying her after she showed him a letter from her doctors with the grim diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia.

Within weeks of returning from their 
honeymoon O'Connell, a construction worker, noticed that his wife's 
condition had not deteriorated.

of the community's hearts and minds, and profited off of their 
generosity.

He telephoned the doctor's office to ask questions about her cancer only to be told Vega was not a patient at the surgery.

The letter she reportedly had obtained from a doctor in Westchester was a forgery.

The couple divorced over the 
deception and O'Connell moved to Virginia to find work. 

Vega has denied making up the cancer story and said at the time that she and her husband separated because he was physically abusive.

The local newspaper reporter who wrote the official story attempted to 
accompany Vega to see her doctor but she failed to turn up for the 
appointment.

Vega and O'Connell have since
 reunited and had a second child. Mr O'Connell, who at one time gave evidence to prosecute his wife, said that although she should repay those who were scammed, his wife needs mental health care and not prison.

Vega is due in court on April 20. For more on this story, read here.
