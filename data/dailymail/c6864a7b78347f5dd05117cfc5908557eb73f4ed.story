Inter Milan's new signings Gary Medel and Dani Osvaldo seem to have settled straight into life at their new club after enjoying a training session with their team-mates on Monday.

They both enjoyed a laugh and a joke on the bench at Inter's training base in Appiano Gentile as they took a break from the session. 

The defensive-minded Medel completed a £10million move to the San Siro outfit last week following Cardiff City's relegation to the Championship.
