The 2014 World Cup came to a thrilling finale on Sunday when Mario Gotze's extra-time goal earned Germany a 1-0 victory over Argentina at the Maracana.

It was a tournament full of stunning goals, epic entertainment, brilliant performances and many shocks. Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler reflects on the 2014 World Cup and lists 10 reasons why it was the best ever.

We wanted attacking football and we got it. A total of 171 goals in 64 games, in fact. But who would have thought the two real pastings of the tournament would see world champions Spain let in five and Brazil hit for seven? Unbelievable.

It was as though everyone got together before the tournament and decided to go for it. Just a shame no-one told England.

Goals galore: Germany put seven past hosts Brazil in the semi-final in Belo Horizonte

Rout: Holland thrashed Spain 5-1 in their Group B opener that was a rematch of the 2010 final

The goals, oh the goals. Was the volley from James Rodriguez better than Tim Cahill’s? Was Jermaine Jones’s long-range effort for the USA better than David Luiz’s freekick?

How about the execution of Robin van Persie’s header again Spain, or could you even make a late argument for Mario Gotze’s dramatic World Cup winner considering the circumstances? Who cares, let’s just celebrate them all.

The underdogs had their day and didn’t we just love it? Hands up who had Costa Rica down to finish top of a group that included three former winners in England, Italy and Uruguay.

Germany needed extra-time and all of Manuel Neuer’s brilliance to see off Algeria, Australia went toe-to-toe with Holland, so too Chile with just about anyone put in their way, and Iran almost beat Argentina before Lionel Messi’s injury-time winner. Yes, Germany won, but it has been the most unpredictable tournament of them all.

David Luiz -  Did any player capture the rollercoaster emotions of this World Cup better than the erratic Brazil defender?

Whether he was belting out the national anthem, belting the ball into the Colombians’ net before embarking on the tournament’s most manic celebration or weeping at his country’s capitulation, we lived it with him. Coco the Clown or the world’s most expensive defender? Both turned up in Brazil and it made for compelling viewing.

Louis van Gaal's game of penalty poker. We were already looking forward to seeing the ‘Iron Tulip’ in the Premier League next season before Van Gaal took the bizarre gamble to substitute goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen with ‘penalty specialist’ Tim Krul in the 120th minute of Holland’s quarter-final against Costa Rica.

The bluff worked as Krul (two saves from 20 penalties faced at Newcastle) won the shootout for the Dutch. Madness or sheer genius? Doesn’t matter. More please, Louis.

When it comes to dirty tricks, we thought we’d seen it all at the World Cup. From the Battle of Santiago between Italy and Chile in 1962 to Harald Schumacher’s attempt to decapitate Patrick Battiston in 1982, the Hand of God (1986), the elbow of Leonardo (1994), Zidane’s headbutt (2006) and Nigel De Jong’s kung-fu kick (2010), frankly we were running out of misdemeanours. Luis Suarez, take a bow.

Punishment: Suarez was banned for four months after his bite during the Group D match

Brazil 1-7 Germany. It was sensational, it was jaw-dropping and at times it was almost too painful to watch. Has there been another result quite like it in the history of the game? Brazil, in the semi-finals of their own World Cup, letting in seven?

Sometimes football has the capacity to transcend sport, to bring us a ‘where were you when’ moment, and this was one of them. Brazil won’t appreciate it, but it has helped make their World Cup simply unforgettable.

Spain didn’t win again. Admit it, we were all getting a bit fed up of tiki-taka and seeing Xavi, Andres Iniesta and Co taking the proverbial out of a succession of opponents who just couldn’t get the ball.

After one World Cup success and two more in the European Championship, enough was enough. Has Brazil ’14 signalled the end of Spanish dominance? Who cares, we just needed a break.

The celebrations. We know, every World Cup has them. But this was a particularly vintage year. Some will prefer the choreographed routines of Colombia and Ghana to the spontaneous outpouring of joy typified by David Luiz’s Tardelli-esque charge to the touchline, the stunned disbelief of John Brooks after he headed a late winner for the USA or Van Persie and Van Gaal also failing to connect with their High Five on the touchline, but we loved them all.

Brazil were the hosts. Would it have been the same if Adrian Chiles, Martin O’Neill, Ian Wright and his ‘gaffer’ Glenn Hoddle had come to us from a studio set up on Blackpool Sands? Would we be cooing at the sight of the Angel of the North looming over the World Cup final? Exactly. For those of us who grew up on Brazilian teams infinitely better than this one, the South American nation can lay claim to being football’s spiritual home and they produced a World Cup worthy of that honour.
