Skype is developing 3D video calls that could eventually allow workers to send 'body doubles' to meetings.

The company is working on technology for the service but it may be several years before it reaches homes and offices.

Mark Gillett, corporate vice-president for Skype, said teams have been working with state-of-the-art tools that capture 3D footage.

'We have it in the lab, we know how to make it work and we're looking at the ecosystem of devices and their capability to support it in order to make a decision when we might think about bringing something like that to market,' he told the BBC.

Skype, which is owned by Microsoft and marks its 10th anniversary today, hinted at its plans in April when it released an advertisement telling viewers it was searching for a way to create 'body doubles' for workers unable to travel to meetings.

Its forays into 3D technology were confirmed as the format appeared to founder in other areas.

The BBC's head of 3D announced last month that there were no further plans to use the technology following a two-year trial.

It ran a pilot scheme in which it televised a number of programmes in 3D including Strictly Come Dancing and the ceremonies for the Olympics last year.

Since its launch, Skype has clocked up more than 1.4 trillion minutes of voice and video calls, which is the equivalent of over 2.6 million years of conversations, made in just a decade

But while an estimated 1.5 million homes have TV sets that can run the technology, only around half of the homes which could watch London 2012 in 3D did so.

The broadcaster said the concept had not taken off with the public and many viewers found it a hassle at home.

In the past decade, millions of people have used Skype to make video calls from locations around the world, from the top of Mount Everest to research stations in Antarctica as well as proving support to refugee camps and allowing endangered orangutans to enjoy calls.

Skype allows people to make free audio and video calls to other Skype users around the world, with just a computer or smartphone running its software as well as a webcam, microphone and speakers.

Once only available on PCs, people can now Skype each other using smartphones, tablets, smart TVs, their home telephones and even gaming devices.
