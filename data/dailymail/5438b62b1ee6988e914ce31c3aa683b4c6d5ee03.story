Elite British sports stars have launched legal action against the World Anti-Doping Agency to ensure athletes caught using recreational drugs are treated 'sympathetically'.

The Professional Players Federation want WADA to give a lesser punishment to players caught taking non-performance-enhancing drugs than those who cheat. 

The union, which represents more than 15,000 people including some of the biggest names in football, golf, rugby and cricket, says a proposed two-year ban is 'draconian'.

The Professional Players Federation has launched a legal bid to ensure WADA bans athletes caught taking performance-enhancing drugs for longer than those who are found to have taken recreational drugs

It has today launched legal action in a Swiss court - the only judicial body to that has the power to review WADA decisions - to try to overturn the proposal.

The union is challenging moves by WADA to punish offenders in the same way for a positive test, irrespective of whether they had used performance-enhancing or recreational drugs

The PPF said the focus should be on trying to help sports stars who take drugs like cocaine and cannabis.

Simon Taylor, general secretary of the PPF, said: 'WADA’s treatment of recreational drugs is still stuck in the twentieth century.

'It is depressing that a group who refuse to even recognise the term "recreational drugs" is now seeking to undermine the good work that is being developed on mental wellbeing and rehabilitation for sportsmen and women with addiction problems.

'Recreation drug abuse has no place in professional sport but it would be naive in the extreme to think that it does not exist.

'Sport and WADA has a "duty of care" to provide appropriate support and treatment rather than just ruin players lives and careers with draconian two year bans that prevent athletes even training.'

A number of British sport stars have been banned or cautioned in recent years for taking recreational drugs such as cocaine and cannabis.

England rugby international and former British Lion Matt Stevens was banned from rugby for two years on February, 2009, after testing positive for cocaine.

Sprinter Mark Lewis-Francis was stripped of his 2005 European Indoor Championship silver medal after he tested positive for cannabis.

He was given a warning by UK Athletics after the body accepted he had not taken it for performance reasons.

Other notable world stars to have been banned for recreational drug use include former Wimbledon champion Martina Hingis, who tested positive for cocaine in 2007; and former Chelsea stars Adrian Mutu and goalkeeper Mark Bosnich were both sacked from the club after the class A drug was found during tests.

Former Wimbledon champion Martina Hingis announced her retirement from the sport in 2007 after testing positive for cocaine at the tournament - although she denied taking the Class A

WADA removed clause 10.4.3 (on substances of abuse) from the new 2015 World Anti-Doping Code, which expected to be ratified at the World Conference On Doping In Sport, beginning on November 12 in Johannesburg.

The clause recognised that recreational drug abuse was wrong but was different from performance enhancing drugs so should have a lower tariff with a focus on rehabilitation as well as bans.

WADA itself had previously noted 'a strong majority of stakeholder' in favour of clause 10.4.3.but it has been dropped.

PPF lawyer Dr Lucien A Valloni has filed papers with the Swiss Federal Supervisory Authority seeking an urgent review of the decision.

WADA's main media spokesman, who is based in the Canadian city of Montreal, was not available for comment.
