Four-year-old Tilly Anderson-Graham was bitten up to 25 times in a vicious dog attack 

A mother has slammed police who refused to investigate a vicious dog attack after the animal jumped into her car and attacked her four-year-old daughter.

Samantha Anderson-Graham, 38, was driving along a country lane in Bures St Mary, Suffolk, when she saw a Lakeland terrier in the middle of the road and got out to shoo it to safety.

But as she did, it leapt in through her door and daughter Tilly was frantically bitten 25 times on her arms, legs and face, as her terrified 12-year-old brother Joe looked on in shock.

The mother-of-four, from Sudbury in Suffolk, was able to get the dog out of the car and reported the incident to the police but claims she was told it was her 'responsibility' for letting the dog in.

It was only after Mrs Anderson-Graham sent letters, photographs and then lodged an official complaint against Suffolk Constabulary that police even recorded the crime.

She said: 'The dog was on top of her, mauling her, and she was just screaming.

'When I managed to get her out the car and into my arms he was jumping up and with every jump he bit her again and again.

'At one point the dog was actually hanging off her bottom and I had to punch it to unlock its jaw.

'How can they say that a dog mauling a four-year-old girl is not a case? I've lost all faith in the police. It's disgusting.'

She added that the dog initially seemed friendly and she had left it in the car while she went to knock on a nearby door to find the owner.

It was while she was walking back to the car that she heard blood-curdling screams and sprinted to the vehicle to find the dog attacking her four-year-old daughter. 

Tilly was in her mother's car when the Lakeland Terrier jumped in through the door and started biting her

'My heart just dropped,' she said. 'She was screaming, I was screaming, and Joe was just in complete shock.

'It went on for about three to four minutes with the dog just biting her while I tried to hold her above my chest, but it felt like a lifetime. It bit her, I would say, 20 to 25 times.'

The dog eventually stopped when another driver arrived on the scene and used a belt to restrain the pet, and hunted for the owner.

Mrs Anderson-Graham, who was also bitten, and Tilly were taken to West Suffolk Hospital for tetanus injections and antibiotics, and medics steri-stripped her wounds.

But while taking her husband, Justin Anderson-Graham, home she claims officers told the 40-year-old electrician there was no case to answer - before officially interviewing anyone involved.

'He said first of all once a dog got into my car that was my responsibility,' she said. 'I told him 'I don't think so'.

'Then after he said he would look into it he said to me "we don't know what happened in that car, you daughter could have been teasing it, there's no case".

'I said "excuse me, have you asked my daughter? No. She's still in bits". I was devastated.

'It was absolutely awful and the fact I had to lodge an official complaint to get it investigated is disgusting.'

After more than two weeks of apparently ignored emails to officers, Mrs Anderson-Graham lodged an official complaint and a senior inspector took on the case.

Gamekeeper Trevor Edwards, 50, was eventually charged and he pleaded guilty to two counts of owning a dog which caused injury while dangerously out of control.

The court ordered the Lakeland terrier, called Eddie, should be destroyed and he was told to pay £2,000 compensation to the family.

That included £1,500 to traumatised Tilly, £300 to Mrs Anderson-Graham and £200 to Joe.

A spokesman from Suffolk Police said: 'When this incident was first reported to police, the initial assessment of the officer who attended was that no criminal offences had taken place.

'A subsequent review of the circumstances found that the case warranted further police investigation, and as a result the owner of the dog was reported for a summons to court.

'We hope that the victims are happy with the outcome of the court hearing and regret any distress caused over the initial handling of this case, which is currently being reviewed.'
