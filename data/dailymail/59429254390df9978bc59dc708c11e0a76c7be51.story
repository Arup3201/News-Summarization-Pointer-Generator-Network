No one would much like the idea of eating 6lb of tomatoes a day.

But if their goodness was popped in an easy-to-swallow pill that you were told might prevent strokes and heart attacks you would probably be putting in an order tomorrow.

Researchers believe they may have come up with just that after trials on the supplement Ateronon.

Health secret: The Ateronon pill contains the lycopene chemical found in tomato skin

The daily pill contains a chemical 
called lycopene which makes tomatoes red and is known to break down 
fatty deposits in the arteries.

A Cambridge University study found 
taking the capsule boosted blood flow and improved the lining of vessels
 in patients with pre-existing heart conditions. It also increased the 
flexibility of their arteries by 50 per cent.

The scientists believe it could limit 
the damage caused by heart disease – responsible for 180,000 deaths a 
year – and help cut the 49,000 deaths a year from strokes.

Breakthrough: Scientists believe the new pill will save millions of lives around the world. Dr Ian Wilkinson, right, is the director of Cambridge University's clinical trials unit

Natural remedy: The pill incorporates a newly developed version of modified lycopene compound

They also 
hope it could benefit those with arthritis, diabetes and even slow the 
progress of cancer.

Each pill provides the equivalent of eating around 
6lb of ripe tomatoes.

Studies have shown eating a Mediterranean-style 
diet rich in tomatoes, fish, vegetables, nuts and olive oil can 
significantly reduce cholesterol and help prevent cardiovascular 
disease.

Preliminary results from a two-month 
trial, in which the pill was given to 36 heart disease patients and 36 
healthy volunteers with an average age of 67, were presented at a 
meeting of the American Heart Association.

It was shown to improve the function 
of the endothelium – the layer of cells lining blood vessels. It also 
boosted their sensitivity to nitric oxide, the gas which triggers the 
dilation of the arteries in response to exercise.

Ian Wilkinson, of Cambridge 
University’s clinical trials unit, said: ‘These results are potentially 
very significant, but we need more trials to see if they translate into 
fewer heart attacks and strokes.’

Peter Kirkpatrick, a leading 
neurosurgeon and medical adviser to CamNutra, which has developed 
Ateronon, said: ‘It is too early to come to firm conclusions, but the 
results from this trial are far better than anything we could have hoped
 for.’

Further studies are planned, with 
researchers hoping it could offer an alternative to statins for heart 
disease sufferers who cannot take the cholesterol-lowering drugs.

Mike Knapton, of the British Heart 
Foundation, said: ‘Although this showed lycopene improved blood flow in 
people with heart disease, that’s a long way from demonstrating that 
taking it could improve outcomes for people with heart disease.

The best
 way to get the benefits of a Mediterranean diet is to eat plenty of 
fresh fruit and vegetables.’
