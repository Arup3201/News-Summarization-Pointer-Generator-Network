Scientists have created a new type of material that can be used to create curved smartphone screens that allows pictures and words to be displayed round corners.

The lightweight and durable C-Axis Aligned Crystal (CAAC) material means there is no longer any need for wasted space on phone screens.

The prototypes, created by a Japanese company, even allow rolling information to run down the sides of a smartphone.

The lightweight and durable C-Axis Aligned Crystal (CAAC) material was used to create this prototype smartphone, which has icons down its sides and allows images to 'spill' round its corners. It also allows for rolling text down its sides (pictured right)

Semiconductor Energy Laboratory (SEL) showed off its new technology at the FPD 2013 electronics trade show in Japan.

Many people have predicted that phones of the future will have curved screens and the crystal-based material means that it is possible to make side-roll and top-roll OLED displays that allow pictures and words to 'spill over' the phone's edges.

The CAAC material is less than 100 microns thick and is currently the 'only technology that can display a picture on bent edges,' according to SEL.

A message alert is displayed on the top curve of the phone (pictured left) while the home button is conveniently located on the side of the handset (pictured right)

Amazingly, the company says that bending the material has no effect on the picture quality of the prototype and it believes it will be used to create the next generation of wearable devices, Diginfo.com reported.

The company has developed bendable lithium ion batteries to go with its bendable new material, allowing for a sleek watch-like prototype device.

In a test where the battery was 
repeatedly bent with the wear-and-tear expected in a wrist device, it could 
be put on and taken off over 10,000 times.

SEL has also created the largest plastic substrate OLED display, which measures 13.5 inches and a resolution of 326 PPI.

Yoshitake Yamamoto, from SEL, said the CAAC material is very reliable and allows for high resolution to be achieved in large displays.

'One feature of CAAC is, it doesn't break easily, because the crystals are continuously aligned. So, it isn't damaged much even if it's bent...this is the only technology that can display a picture on bent edges,' he said.
