The misery of camping in the great British summertime could soon be a thing of a past - provided you're prepared to hang from a tree.

An American company has developed a waterproof 'sky tent' that avoids the rain, bugs and sleeping on a cold, hard floor.

It is made from nylon parachute material and is tied up using climbing ropes or carabiners - and can help campers avoid hazards such as flooding, muddy terrain and wildlife.

The Sky Tent 2 from Arizona-based Hammock Bliss sleeps two people in hammocks and can help campers avoid hazards such as flooding, muddy terrain and wildlife. It is made from nylon parachute material and is tied up using climbing ropes or carabiners

The hammock cover has No-See-Um Netting surrounding the base which has a 2100 holes per square inch. It keeps out small bugs and also resists rips and tears. The netting can also reduce the wind chill factor

Dimensions: 138inch-by-73inch-43inch

Weight: 1.3KG

Storage: Stuff Sack can hold Sky Tent 2 and any sized hammock

Ripstop Nylon Base Layer

Double Pull YKK Zippers

100in of cord at four corners secures rain fly to the ground

80inch of 6mm climbing rope to attach the tent to trees 

Plus 138inch of climbing rope secures adjustable ridge line

Hammock Bliss Carabiners (optional)

The Sky Tent 2, made by Arizona-based Hammock Bliss, sleeps two people in hammocks and can can fit two hammocks inside - one above the other - for couples to share.

An 
oversized raincover protects campers from the rain while netting on both sides of the tent keeps out small bugs.

The Sky Tent 2's ripstop nylon base layer also helps keep in body heat and is sturdy and waterproof enough if campers want to pitch the Sky Tent on the ground. 

A Prusik 
knot helps support the tent but is also adjustable so campers can change the size of the Sky Tent 2's ridgeline.

Backpacks and clothes can also be hung from the hammocks rope to keep them off the ground, and secure.

Designers Dov and Brian Frazer are shown in their Sky Tent 2 on the Six Foot Track near that Blue Mountains in Sydney, Australia. Their weight is supported by the hammocks and not the surrounding tent. The hammock ropes can also be used to hang personal belongings from

The features of the Sky Tent 2. It comes with 100 inches of climbing rope that supports the rain fly. The tent itself is suspended using a separate 80inch rope

Sky Tent 2 is designed to be suspended around the hammock but it is not attached to it.

This means a camper's body weight and gear weight are supported by the sturdy hammock ropes and the 
tree straps, rather than onto the Sky Tent 2.

Sky Tent 2 is made by hammock designers Dov Frazer and Roslin Falk Frazer who own Hammock Bliss.

The couple say the Sky Tent 2 is a 'relaxing and unusual way to camp.

Adding: 'Sky Tent 2 is a revolution in the making, bringing hammock camping to a new level of comfort and convenience.'

The Sky Tent 2 costs £83 ($130) but doesn't include the hammocks.

While we would prefer that you use Sky Tent with a Hammock Bliss hammock, it works equally well with most any parachute nylon hammock.

The original Sky Tent, which slept one person, was introduced in August of 2011 and costs £77.

It used parachute nylon as the floor and had a fixed ridgeline. 

Although the Sky Tent 2 can sleep two people, it can also be used by single camper - giving that person extra room. The nylon base means that the tent can be switched between being suspended from the trees and being pitched on the ground

Campers without hammocks can alternatively buy the floating tent, which launched last month.

Architect Alex Shirley-Smith, 36, 
invented the bizarre tents which are designed to be suspended at chest 
height, with three ties attaching them to trees, pulled tightly.

Although
they may look flimsy, each three-man tent is designed to support almost
two tonnes in weight - so there's no danger of falling back to earth 
with a bump in the middle of the night.

The
clever design is based on the same pattern that a spider uses to build 
its web - building support up from a series of three points.

For £820, campers can experience their very own floating holiday. This camp of three floating tents is completely off the ground. They can sleep three people and were designed by architect Alex Shirley-Smith

In May, the Secret Campsite at Town Littleworth, East Sussex introduced another alternative 'tree tent' that looks like a futuristic orb hovering above the ground.

It is suspended
three metres above the forest floor from a series of ropes attached to a woodland canopy and sleeps two adults.

It has a luxurious 
double bed that folds up to create a bench seat, LED lighting and even 
space for a woodburning stove.

A wooden walkway leads campers up to 
the oval front door of the quirky tent, which is suspended in mid-air by
eight spider-like ropes attached to surrounding trees.

The
frame is made from British ash wood sourced from local forests and 
recycled aluminium, with a cover made entirely from waterproof cotton.

This futuristic orb might look like a UFO as it hovers high above the ground but it is actually the country's first 'tree tent'

The 'tree tents' sleeps two adults. The beds can then be folded out into bench seats. These orbs at The Secret Campsite at Town Littleworth in East Sussex come with views of the South Downs and cost £95 a night
