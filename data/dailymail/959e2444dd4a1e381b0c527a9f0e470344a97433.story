Victim: Ahmed Fareed has been jailed for life after he brutally murdered retired Salvation Army Officer Major Janet Gilson, pictured, in Hong Kong

A man who brutally murdered a retired British Salvation Army officer in Hong Kong by strangling her with a rope has been jailed for life.

Major Janet Gilson, 64, was found hidden under a sofa at her niece’s home in Lamma, the third largest island in Hong Kong,  three days after she was reported missing.

Ahmed Fareed - believed to be the 
ex-husband of Maj Gilson’s niece - was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to life in prison at the city’s high court yesterday.

In passing sentence, Mr Justice Michael Stuart-Moore, as reported by the South China Morning Post, said: 'This was a most brutal killing of a woman aged 64 who had done no harm to the defendant.

'I have not doubt he [Fareed] is highly dangerous.

'Words fail to describe the whole horror.'

Fareed, who was 29 at the time of the killing, had been barred by a court order 
from entering his ex-wife's home before the murder in March 2011.

The court heard Maj Gilson - who had retired shortly before her death and lived in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex -  had been 
suffocated.

She also had a towel stuffed 
into her mouth and four of her ribs had been broken.

Fareed, from the Maldives, was arrested at Hong Kong’s ferry harbour shortly after the murder.

The jury returned a unanimous guilty verdict after a six-day trial.

Outside court Maj Gilson’s niece, Julia, told the South China Morning Post: 'To those people that are in relationships with violent partners: I strongly urge you to get away.

'I made the mistake of believing I could help change my ex-husband, giving him many chances.

'I realise the error of that judgment now and hope that others can also learn from that.'

Speaking
at the time, Major Carol Bailey, regional manager for the Salvation 
Army, said: 'Major Gilson was a Salvation Army officer for many years 
and retired only in recent years.

'She was a deeply spiritual woman and was highly respected and loved by all those with whom she worked and came into contact.

'As a Christian minister and leader she worked in many capacities for The Salvation Army, not just in the UK but also in Russia.

'She was an inspirational person and she will be sadly missed.'
