Two years after losing the presidency to Barack Obama, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney is positioned to crush all comers in a crowded field of Republican 2016 hopefuls, according to a poll of Iowa voters released Wednesday. 

His stunning performance in the early caucus state came just one day after he told a radio interviewer that while he doesn't plan to run for the White House again... but 'circumstances can change', he said.

'I love the country enough to know that I'm not as good a candidate this time around as I think the other guys would be,' Romney told radio host Hugh Hewitt on Tuesday,  'because they're new and not defined. I want the country to win. I do not want to see Hillary Clinton as our next president. So I stepped aside so someone who has a better shot will be able to step forward.'

In a USA Today/Suffolk University poll, 35 per cent of Iowa Republicans said they would support Romney if their state's nominating process kicked off today. No one else in the field of 14 potential presidential candidates had a double-digit showing.

Still hungry for Mitt: Romney has fans in every state, including some independent voters who have buyer's remorse after supporting President Obama in 2012

Former Arkansas governor and Fox News Channel host Mike Huckabee came in a distant second with just under 9 per cent.  New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie had 6.5 per cent support, followed by perennial conservative candidate and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum with 5.9 per cent. 

Without Romney in the mix, the poll numbers still showed Huckabee and Christie atop the leader board with 13.1 per cent and 10.7 per cent support, respectively. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who faces a politically charged abuse of power indictment in his home state, would run third in a Romney-free field with 8.8 per cent.

Inserting Romney into the hypothetical race would shift more votes from moderate candidates, leaving conservative stalwarts' numbers relatively untouched.

Romney has said repeatedly the he's leaning against running again, but he told Hewitt that he would enjoy a second ride on the campaign roller coaster.

'I know this is hard for a lot of people to recognize,' he said, 'but frankly, I'd love to run for president. I loved running for president.'

But 'someone else has a better chance than I do,' he cautioned. 'And that's what we believe, and that's why I'm not running.'

'And you know, circumstances can change,' he said. 'Well, you know, let's say all the guys that were running all came together and said, "Hey, we've decided we can't do it. You must do it." That's the one-of-a-million we're thinking about.'

For now, Romney is busy talking up the bona fides of those other Republican maybe-candidates. 

'There are people who are not yet known by the American public who have extraordinary records, great capability,' he said, 'Paul Ryan being one of them, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, Marco Rubio.'

'Of course, people are getting to know Chris Christie,' he added. 'Jeb Bush – they don't know Jeb Bush as the governor of Florida, and the kind of record he has and had there.'

'These are people who I think have the potential to really ignite interest in our party and potentially win the general [election].'

Romney-watchers have seen other indications that the GOP base is warming to the possibility of a do-over for the 2012 runner-up.

In June a Suffolk University/Boston Herald poll of likely New Hampshire Republican voters, 24 per cent picked Romney as their dog in the race. As with the Iowa survey, no one else in the field cracks into double digits.

Christie was the second-place finisher in that poll, with 9 per cent. 

New Hampshire and Iowa are two of the three most important early bellwether states in the presidential nominating process, the third being South Carolina.

Presidential exploratory committee watch those states closely to gauge their chances, since victories in the first handful of states can translate into fundraising windfalls and priceless media spotlights.
