Budget retail chain Primark has seen its profits soar by 26 per cent to £298 million in just six months.

Parent company Associated British Foods (ABF) put the chain's success down to its rapid expansion after several new stores were launched last year.

The move pushed sales up 14 per cent to £2.3billion in the 24 weeks leading up to March 1 while its operating margin increased by 13.1 per cent. 

There are now 269 Primark stores covering nearly 10 million square feet of selling space across nine European countries - with the company now hoping to launch in the U.S.

Soaring profits: Primark has seen its profits rise by 26% in the last six months after sales went up 14%

It plans to open a 70,000 square-foot store in Boston next year with negotiations under way to open further stores in the north east of the country in 2016.

The
 new store in Boston will be in the Burnham Building, which is currently
 being renovated, at Downtown Crossing, in the heart of the city. The 
site was previously home to Boston's famous Filene's department store.

The retailer said: 'Primark has a strong consumer following in nine countries in Western Europe.  After extensive research it has been decided to take the concept to consumers in the USA.'

The United States has been a notoriously tricky market for UK retailers to crack, with Tesco and Marks & Spencer among those to experience failure.

But the company is hopeful the brand will be as successful in the U.S. as it has been in Europe.

Primark's expansion
 in the UK has been focused on increasing selling space in major cities,
 with the opening of its second store in London's Oxford Street and 
extensions to shops in Newcastle and Manchester.

It expects to add 
more than a million square feet of space in the current financial year,
 having opened its first stores in France in Marseille and Dijon. Three 
new UK stores in the second half include a relocation in Cardiff.

The chain's profit announcement comes days after the anniversary of the collapse of an nine-storey factory in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where Primark clothes were being made.

The collapse of Rana Plaza on April 24 last year claimed the lives of 1,100 people making it retail’s worst industrial accident ever.

It also highlighted the issue of where Britain’s cheap clothes are made and the conditions and safety of the workers involved.

Bonmarche and Matalan were also found to be using workers in the building at the time of the collapse.

Many other British retailers were suspected to have used suppliers in the same facility in the period leading up to the collapse.

ABF has now started paying $9million (£5.34million) in long-term compensation to the affected families.

Tragedy: The announcement came a few days after the anniversary of the Rana Plaza building collapse which killed 1,129 garment workers who were making clothes for British companies including Primark

It is also donating $1million (£595,000) to the Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund, chaired by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

This is on top of the $2million (£1.18million) it has already paid in short-term aid to the families of all the workers employed at Rana Plaza.

ABF said the total compensation has come to $12million - $7million of which was included in last year's results while the remaining $5million will be factored into this year's results.

Primark chairman Charles Sinclair said: 'We support the International Labour Organization in urging other retailers sourcing from Rana Plaza to donate to the Trust Fund so that it can pay out in full to the remaining victims.

'The safety of the staff we employ both directly, and indirectly through our suppliers, is a high priority for the group, and the Rana Plaza tragedy underlined the imperative for change in the Bangladeshi garment industry.'

Shares in AB Foods, whose operations cover sugar, agriculture, retail, grocery and ingredients, opened seven per cent
 higher today.

With its portfolio of kitchen cupboard brands such as 
Ryvita, Ovaltine and Silver Spoon sugar also doing well, the group's 
profits rose four per cent to £468 million in the half year.
