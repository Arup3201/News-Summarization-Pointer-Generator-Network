She's already the face of Tom Ford, Burberry, Topshop, Mulberry and Chanel but it seems that big brands just can't get enough of Cara Delevingne.

The supermodel, actress and singer, who earned £2.4m or £6,500 a day in the past year, has just been unveiled as the face of YSL's Christmas beauty campaign.

The 22-year-old, known for her distinctive bushy eyebrows and happy-go-lucky attitude, showcases the French beauty giant's Wildly Gold collection.

Another campaign? Cara Delevingne proves she still reigns supreme as the world's most in-demand supermodel as she is unveiled as the face of YSL's Christmas campaign 

The range is full of dazzling black, iridescent bronze, shimmery gold and silver shades that Cara showcases to perfection in the new campaign imagery. 

Cara has been the face of the brand for over a year and worked with best friend and fellow supermodel Jourdan Dunn to promote the Touche Eclat earlier this year.

But why do brands still obsess over Cara, who is also building a name for herself as a thespian? And does she still have huge selling power despite spreading herself so thinly in the fashion industry? 

Rounding the year off nicely! Cara was also unveiled as the face of Topshop's Christmas collection and walked in the SS15 show for Sir Philip Green's brand

Brit babe: The 22-year-old is also the face of Mulberry and recently designed a range of handbags for the luxury British brand 

Rakesh Aggarwal, founder of online beauty retailer Escentual.com, said: 'In today's society, celebrity sells - there's no doubt about it. For consumers, purchasing a product endorsed by their favourite star allows them to tap in to the celebrity lifestyle, bridging the gap between themselves and their icons.

'It's only natural that fashion and beauty brands keep returning to Cara Delevingne to front their most crucial campaigns. Whenever Cara lends herself to a product, rest assured it will fly off the shelves. She has a universal appeal - since being labelled the new Kate Moss, she commands media attention and interest like no other public figure. People across the world are fixated on what she is wearing and doing - both on and off the catwalks.

Something to smile about: It has been revealed that Cara Delevingne earned £2.4m - or £6,500 a day - in the past year

'Cara has incredible gravitas in both the high fashion and high street industries - she switches from glamorous gowns and stilettos one day to onesies and trainers the next, pulling off a wealth of different looks with aplomb. She'll be photographed in a T-shirt or beanie hat one night and that product will be completely sold out the next day.

'The biggest reason for Cara's colossal selling power, though, is her quirky character. She is the kind of person girls wish they were friends with - energetic, quirky, vivacious and fun, with a relatable down-to-earth persona. 

'Brands are also very aware of Cara's massive social media presence - with 1.94m followers on Twitter and over 8on Instagram, her worldwide influence is ever-growing. She is certainly the fashion and beauty it-girl du jour, and with numerous Hollywood movie appearances now in the pipeline, her massive appeal to companies only looks to increase.'

One thing is for sure: she's cashing in. Cara boasted £1.1m of cash in the bank and was owed a further £1.3m from modelling deals, reveal figures. 

The debut set of figures are the first-ever marker of the young model’s incredible earning power.

The accounts come as the award-winning youngster was also unveiled as the face of Topshop’s Christmas collection.

It also follows her latest campaign for iconic British brand Burberry, which saw her feature alongside modelling veteran Kate Moss, 40, who she has been compared to.

The accounts, filed at Companies House by her firm Cara & Co, cover the 12 months to the end of January this year.

Fun-loving: The model, who is known for her happy demeanor, starred in campaigns and shows for fashion giants Chanel, Victoria's Secret, right, and DKNY

Her work over the period included campaigns and shows for fashion giants Chanel, Victoria's Secret and DKNY.

The paperwork shows she had bills of £1.5m, although £326,349 of this was owed to herself as a director.

It leaves the fledgling company, set up in January last year, with a total profit of £864,961.

The former public school girl boasts nearly 8m followers on Instagram and has also turned her talents to acting and singing.

Moschino, Dolce & Gabbana, Stella McCartney, Fendi, H&M and Zara are just some of the other leading companies she has worked for. 

So powerful is Cara for brand that Celebrity Intelligence, the celebrity monitor, listed her in the top three on its ‘Very Important Endorser’ list for 2014.

This list reveals the most in-demand celebrities on both sides of the Atlantic, based on the most searched and viewed this year by 2,500 industry professionals.

In Celebrity Intelligence’s 2014 VIE list, UK talent such as Rita Ora, Cara Delevingne, Lily Allen, come out ahead of US favourites Kim Kardashian West, Taylor Swift and Katy Perry. 

Joseph Morgan, Strategy Director at brand interactions agency Matter of Form, added: 'Cara Delevingne's popularity and subsequent selling power are not just a result of her great social networking skills, modelling career, looks, figure and personality (although this does help). 

'They're also a result of her unwavering ability to be herself regardless of audience or channel she's presenting herself in. Whether it is at an event, in the news, through social media or on film, Cara consistently delivers 100 per cent authenticity.

'At a time when many brands are struggling to prove how honest and trustworthy they really are, this is priceless. For brands wanting to position themselves as youthful, credible and straight-talking, Cara is an asset that will only increase in value over time.'

Richard Armstrong, CEO & Founder of content marketing agency Kameleon, added: 'Whilst Cara is undoubtedly an icon it would be nice to see brands be more innovative and daring in their approach to using her or other celebrities. We look to these high-end brands to set the precedent in creativity, but if they are all following another where is the differentiation?

'She may be hot property at the moment, but at a time where consumers are bombarded with content, brands need to be brave and stand out from the crowd. These brands are trend-setters; it would be great to see a brand really lead the way by utilising her appeal differently or even building a new icon.

'If used wisely, Cara has the potential to drive significant returns for the brands she works with. If not, brands are at risk of her shelf-life and selling power being limited.'
