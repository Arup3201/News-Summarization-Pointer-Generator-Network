Danny Welbeck was absent as England took part in an open training session in Urca on Wednesday.

The Manchester United forward is considered a doubt for England's opening World Cup game against Italy after limping out of training with a hamstring strain on Tuesday.

All eyes were therefore searching for Welbeck in the part-open session at the Urca military base, yet there was no sign of him despite being pictured outside the team hotel earlier on Wednesday.Â 

Wayne
 Rooney however, claimed his club, and international team-mate, would be fit to face the Italians.

'Danny will be fine and I'm sure he'll be ready for Saturday,' Rooney said. 'We have training on Friday and he'll be ready for Saturday I'm sure.'

Rooney and the rest of his England team-mates appeared relaxed, and in 
good spirits, as they took part in a game of 'heads, shoulders, knees 
and toes'.

The particular session appeared to be led by England's assistant coach Gary Neville, who also seen joining in with the game.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was the other 
member of the 23-man squad not to head out, with the midfielder doing an
 individual programme as he continues his rehabilitation from a medial 
knee ligament complaint.

That injury meant the 20-year-old was never likely to be involved against Italy, but the same cannot be said for Welbeck.

The
 forward looked likely to start on the left flank in Manaus on Saturday,
 with the setback potentially set to force manager Roy Hodgson into a 
rethink.

Raheem Sterling looks likely to be the beneficiary of 
Welbeck's absence, having impressed during the pre-tournament camp 
despite only getting 39 minutes of action across the three warm-up 
friendlies.

Having not featured against Peru in their Wembley 
send-off, his red card against Ecuador after coming off the bench saw 
him banned against Honduras - a match Hodgson had planned to start him 
in.

Sterling had another chance to impress the Three Lions boss in 
training on Wednesday, which took place in 83 per cent humidity with the
 mercury hitting 25 degrees Celsius.

The players had access to water 
spray bottles during drink breaks at the session, where assistant Ray 
Lewington hobbled around in a cast after having surgery on his left 
knee.

Meanwhile,
 former England Under 21 manager Stuart Pearce believes that Arsenal 
midfielder Jack Wilshere 'will not kick a ball' during the World Cup.

Pearce, who won 78 caps for England and appeared at the 1990 World Cup, told talkSPORT:
 'I think there are five players that will not kick a ball at the World 
Cup. Forster and Foster are the obvious ones and I think Shaw, Smalling 
and Wilshere will be the others.

'I
 think he [Wilshere] is very, very short of form. Watching the last game
 [against Honduras] I didn't see a Wilshere that sprung on the scene 
many months ago.

'I just think he is very, very short of confidence and I see Lampard, Lallana or Barkley ahead of him now.

'I
 just feel his lack of form really [will cost him] and that will be on 
Roy's mind. He had a very disappointing last game and he has not shown 
me the fully fit Wilshere we saw when he came on the scene.'
