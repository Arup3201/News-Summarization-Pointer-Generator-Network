Escaped jail: Brian Dodgeon, 61, arrives at Isleworth Crown Court today where he was given an eight month suspended sentence

A university lecturer who admitted 
owning the drugs that led to the death of a schoolgirl at his house was 
spared jail yesterday.

Isobel Jones-Reilly, 15, died in April after taking ecstasy at a party at Brian Dodgeon’s home.

He had the ecstasy hidden in a 
wardrobe in his bedroom, along with LSD, ketamine and a psychedelic drug
known as Foxy Methoxy, but said he never thought teenagers attending 
the party hosted by his daughter would find it.

Dodgeon, 61, who seriously injured 
himself in a failed suicide attempt after Isobel’s death at his west 
London home, was at a party in Hastings with his partner, Angela 
Hadjipateras, at the time.

They had told neighbours and a friend 
about the party thrown by his daughter Beatrice on Good Friday and made 
sure the parents of the teenage guests knew they were not going to be at
home.

Dodgeon, a former research fellow at 
the University of London’s Institute of Education, admitted four counts 
of possessing Class A drugs.

Around 30 teenagers attended the party and were drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana.

Howard Tobias, prosecuting at 
Isleworth Crown Court, said that around midnight Beatrice, 14, went to 
search her father’s room for marijuana and found a container with his 
drugs ‘at the back of a high-up cupboard’.

Isobel took two pills and started hallucinating and frothing at the mouth soon after.

When she stopped breathing, her 
friends called for an ambulance and attempted mouth-to-mouth and CPR, 
but she was pronounced dead at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington later 
that morning.

The cause of her death was listed as MDMA, or ecstasy, 
ingestion.

Beatrice and two 14-year-old boys, who all took one tablet each, also went to the hospital, where Dodgeon was later arrested.

He told police he had collected the 
drugs over 12 years as he was a recreational user.

Describing himself as
an ‘old hippy’, he said he occasionally took ecstasy at dance parties 
and it had ‘never crossed his mind’ that anyone would find his drugs.

After the incident, he jumped off a 
flyover on the North Circular Road in Walthamstow, east London, breaking
numerous bones and fracturing his skull.

He also had brain surgery 
after the leap and now needs weekly physiotherapy sessions.

Mr Tobias said Isobel’s family had been left ‘devastated’ by her death ‘at the start of her life’.

In mitigation, Sarah Elliot described 
Dodgeon as a ‘broken man’, adding: ‘He has to live with the consequences
and the knowledge of the harm he has inadvertently caused.’

Beatrice also suffered with guilt, she said, and a custodial sentence would mean he would not be there to support her.

His job, from which he is currently suspended, would also be immediately terminated.

She said: ‘He genuinely did not see 
that harm would occur. He genuinely believed his actions in permitting 
the party were not irresponsible. He and his partner have been proved 
terribly wrong in hindsight.’

Sentencing Dodgeon to eight months 
suspended for two years, Judge Andrew McDowell said: ‘The worst 
punishment you can have is one that will last for the rest of your 
conscious life – the knowledge that the possession of these drugs and 
your failure to keep them secure from teenage experimentation has 
resulted in a death.

‘It seems this is a terrible lapse and a terrible misfortune which you feel as keenly as it is possible to feel.’

Dodgeon will also have to pay £150 costs and stick to a 9pm-to-7am curfew for six months.
