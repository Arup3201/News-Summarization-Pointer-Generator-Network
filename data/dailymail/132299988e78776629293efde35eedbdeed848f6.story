With its distinctive design reaching 180 feet into the air, the new Twin Sails bridge in Poole Harbour is a pleasure to behold.

Yesterday, Princess Anne arrived to officially open the £37m construction, which has been 40 years in the planning and gracefully splits in half to allow boats to pass through.

There's just one problem - no cars are allowed to use it.

Opening one: A huge crowd of people stand on the new £37million bridge on February 25 as the Mayor of Poole Graham Wilson opens the Twin Sails bridge in Poole, Dorset, to Pedestrians

Emergency repairs: This large chunk of tarmac fell off the bridge when it was lifted up to allow a boat through in Poole, Dorset. It has now been shutdown so repairs can be carried out

Engineers spotted a large crack in the surface and a large two square metre chunk of the asphalt surface broke off while the bridge was last lifted up.

Although experts have examined the bridge, they have failed to ascertain exactly what is wrong. They may yet have to pull up all the Tarmac and relay it.

But despite the problems, it has not stopped dignitaries repeatedly declaring the closed bridge 'open'.

Yesterday Princess Anne was greeted by hundreds of well-wishers as she visited the site and pressed the operator’s button to raise the two leaves.

Three days earlier the Mayor of Poole Graham Wilson staged a ceremonial lifting of the bridge to a Royal Marine trumpet fanfare and the cheers of 2,000 people.

Before that on February 25 the mayor cut a ribbon to declare the bridge open to pedestrians.

Opening two: A crowd gathers on the bridge as Mayor Graham Wilson stages the second official opening - lifting the bridge to allow boats through

Opening three: Prince Anne holds a second lifting of the bridge as it is given its third official opening. Although engineers had discovered faults the council said the event had to go ahead because 'you can't delay a royal visit'

Officially open? Prince Anne is driven across the bridge - but it is now closed because of problems with the surface which will have to be re-laid, at least partially

A spokesman for Poole Borough Council confirmed there are no more opening ceremonies planned.

The bridge in Poole has been planned for the last 40 years. It connects parts of the town centre with the district of Hamworthy.

Engineers are working to try and repair the bridge but they cannot say how long it will remain closed to both cars and pedestrians.

Workers from contractors Hochtief found chunks of rubble, in pieces measuring up to one foot long on land beneath the bridge after it was lowered hours before Princess Anne’s visit.

A 60ft by 21ft area of the road surface will be pulled up and inspected and then sections of it will be relaid.

Bridge of sighs: Engineers have admitted they do not know exactly what the problem with the £37million bridge is - or when it can be reopened

They do not yet know if one, two or all three layers of the asphalt will have to be relaid.

Jim Bright, strategic director at Poole Borough Council, said: 'We have not fully understood the problem that we have got and are looking to the contractor and his specialists for advice.

'We do know that it is a defect that has occurred and where there is a defect appropriate remedial action has to be determined.

'Relaying the quickdrying surface will take a couple of days.

'It is a relatively small job to undertake once we understand what we need to do.

'To say "It is going to open this week or in a week" would just not be possible.

Official opening: Mayor Graham Wilson cuts the ribbon to declare the bridge open to pedestrians last month - but it has now had to close again

'The Twin Sails Bridge is a complex structure and our contractor has made a huge effort to complete the project on time.'

A council spokesman said they could not have postponed any of the opening ceremonies as they had been booked well in advance.

She said: 'You can’t delay a royal visit.

'The event on March 9 was to commemorate 85 years of the old bridge as well as celebrate the new bridge and the ribbon cutting event was part of a community weekend that we held.

'It is a construction programme and you can’t predict issues that can arise.'

Celebration: People gather on the bridge for the first opening ceremony last month - but it has now had to be shutdown again
