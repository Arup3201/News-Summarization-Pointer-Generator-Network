Qatar have revealed the design for the second of its 10 brand new stadiums being built ahead of hosting the World Cup in 2022.

The Al Bayt stadium in Al Khor City, just over 30 miles north of the capital Doha, is expected to be ready by 2018, well ahead of schedule to host the tournament in eight years time.

Preliminary work has already begun on the extravagant arena, the design of which is based on Bayt Al Shaâ€™ar, a traditional black-and-white tent used by nomadic people in Qatar.

It follows the 40,000 Al Wakrah stadium as the second World Cup arena to be unveiled of a total of 10 before the tournament.

The area surrounding the venue will feature space for local businesses and restaurants, as well as landscaped paths to be used for exercise.

Hassan Al Thawadi, Secretary General of Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy, said: 'The launch of Al Bayt Stadium & Precinct, the second proposed stadium for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, is another milestone of progress.

'By the end of 2014 we will have five stadiums under construction, demonstrating our deep commitment to delivering an amazing experience in 2022 and beyond.'

A detachable upper tier will see the stadium's capacity downsized to 32,000-seater after the World Cup. The removed seats will be reconfigured and donated to other countries to leave a legacy for international football development.

FIFA imposes a minimum requirement of eight stadiums for World Cup host countries, with at least one 80,000-seater to host the final.
