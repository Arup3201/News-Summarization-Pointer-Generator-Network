'Risk inherent part of job': Chief constable Mike Cunningham, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, has criticised a decision by an officer to demand compensation from a garage owner after injuring herself on a 999 call

A chief constable today added his voice to growing anger over the Kelly Jones compensation case by saying it was 'wholly inappropriate' for police officers to make claims against victims of crime.

Mike Cunningham, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, spoke out after Pc Jones was criticised for taking legal action against a petrol station owner after she tripped on a kerb answering a 999 call.

It comes after Home Secretary Theresa May stepped into the row over the weekend by ordering a review of all such compensation cases involving the police.

Pc Jones is making a claim against 
Steve Jones, 50, the owner of Nuns' Bridges Filling Station in Thetford,
Norfolk, for failing to ensure she was 'reasonably safe' when she 
attended a suspected break-in in August 2012.

After
her astonishing claim became public, her own Chief Constable, Phil 
Gormley, criticised it as ‘surprising and disappointing’.

Mr
Cunningham told ITV's Daybreak programme: 'It is, to me, wholly 
inappropriate that police officers claim compensation against victims of
crime, people to whom we have responded in order to help them.

'However,
there are occasions, and I think many members of the public would 
accept and understand this, when an officer is badly assaulted on duty 
and loses earnings as a result; then it may be that they should have 
access to the criminal injuries compensation scheme along with everybody
else.'

Mr Cunningham, who is Chief Constable 
of the Staffordshire force, added: 'I think it is self-evident that risk
is an inherent part of being a police officer and when police officers 
join they absolutely know that and are aware of it.

'In
fact, it is one of the appeals of the job that police officers put 
themselves between harm and victims, and that's what we do.

'There
are occasions when officers unfortunately will be injured as a result 
of the profession they have chosen and it is in those circumstances when
the issue of compensation arises.'

Centre of national row: WPC Jones (pictured with her father Danny Harle on her first day as a police officer) has been criticised for taking legal action against a petrol station owner after she tripped on a kerb on a 999 call

Sources say Mrs May fears that the trend for officers to sue could deter victims from reporting crimes.

Mrs
May’s action follows not only the Jones case, but an incident where a 
policeman is suing a burglary victim for £10,000 after allegedly falling
into a drain while investigating a break-in at West Horsley, Surrey.

PC Richard Seymour is claiming against shop-owner Stuart Lambley for ‘loss of overtime’ despite being on full pay throughout.

Mrs May will ask for a review of such cases when she returns to work from holiday today.

She
is said to believe it is unreasonable for police to demand compensation
for minor injuries in their normal line of duty, and their right to sue
burglary victims for injuries sustained while chasing criminals may now
be curbed.

Critical: Pc Jones's own Chief Constable, Phil Gormley (left), described her claim as ‘surprising and disappointing’, while Home Secretary Theresa May has ordered a review of police compensation cases

A Home Office source said: ‘It seems 
wrong that a PC should sue someone who reports a crime for a minor 
injury.  There would be serious concerns if it deterred people from 
reporting crimes.

‘Similarly,
common sense tells you that owing to the nature of their work, police 
may suffer a few cuts and bruises. It would be wrong for them to put in a
claim for compensation every time this happens.‘The victims of crime have the right to be treated as such, not turned into criminals themselves.’

PC Jones is also demanding compensation 
from her own force after she was in a police car which skidded off the 
road and ended on its side during a chase in January last year.

She put in a compensation claim 
to Norfolk Constabulary, which would not discuss details. Her lawyers 
said she injured her knee and her employers accepted liability.

Her lawyers, Pattinson Brewer, said: ‘Kelly believes she has the right to go to work and not be harmed by someone else’s negligence.’

The Police Federation is backing PC Jones’s action against Mr Jones, who is not related to the officer. It says she wants to claw back ‘lost earnings’.

But it is understood she has lost only overtime and night shift pay as she was on a full salary while recovering from both incidents.

PC Jones is on sick leave but is due back on active duty soon.

A total of £67.1 million has been paid out to injured officers in settlements in the four years from 2009 to 2012, figures from the federation showed.
