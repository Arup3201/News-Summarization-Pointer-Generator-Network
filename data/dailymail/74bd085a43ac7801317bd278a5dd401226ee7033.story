George Osborne was today accused of ignoring a 'mega problem' with the nation's finances as the amount of taxes which went unpaid rose to £34billion.

The so-called 'tax gap' in 2012-13 rose to 6.8 per cent of all taxes owed going unpaid, thanks to evasion, avoidance, error and criminality.

Ministers admitted there is 'still more work to do' to deal with the problem, but the head of the Commons spending watchdog warned law-abiding taxpayers are 'losing out massively'.

The amount of unpaid tax rose to £34billion in 2012-13, HM Revenue and Customs admitted today

The biggest slice of unpaid taxes was attributed to income tax, National Insurance and Capital Gains Tax

New figures from HM Revenue and Customs show that £1 in every £15 owed in taxes was not collected last year.

The gap had been shrinking, but last year hit the highest level since before the coalition was formed, topping £34billion.

Some 6.8 per cent of tax that was due was not collected in 2012/13, compared to 6.6 per cent in 2011-12, resulting in an increase of £1 billion in the gap.

The increase in the overall tax gap was due to an increase in the VAT gap of £0.9 billion and an increase of £0.3 billion in uncollected tobacco duty.

Ministers insisted that the gap was lower now than under Labour but critics seized on the figure to claim the Government was failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion.

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the powerful Public Accounts Committee, told MailOnline: 'It is a mega problem that has got worse and this is a very conservative figure. The taxpayer who pays their proper taxes is losing out massively.

'I am worried that what is happening with the HMRC and the government is they talk the talk but they don't walk the walk.

'They say they are committed to tackling the tax gap, they say they are committed to accuracy, better control of their figures and customer service.

'But then we have to find out that things are much worse than they admit to.

'The health service has got a gap of £30billion. It is a big elephant in the room. The government is not facing up to that and if they just got on top of the tax gap, they could protect the NHS.'

The long-term trend is downward, with the tax gap falling from 8.5 per cent in 2005/06, HMRC insisted.

HMRC attributed £3.1 billion of the gap to tax avoidance, down from £3.4 billion. 

Some £14.2 billion of income tax, national insurance contributions or capital gains tax went uncollected, along with £12.4 billion of VAT.

Corporation tax made up £3.9 billion of the gap, with excise duties accounting for £2.9 billion.

Financial Secretary to the Treasury David Gauke said: 'Since 2010-11 the percentage tax gap has stayed lower than at any point under the previous government, saving the country £4 billion.

'Today's figures show that there's still more work to do but our continued drive to tackle avoidance means that avoidance is down.

'In 2012-13 HMRC achieved a compliance yield of £20.7 billion, rising to a record breaking £23.9 billion in 2013/14.

'The UK has one of the lowest tax gaps in the world but HMRC will continue to deploy its resources and skills to maintain the downward pressure that has proved so effective in recent years.'

Labour's shadow exchequer secretary Shabana Mahmood said: 'These damning figures show that this Government is totally failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion.

A squeeze on wage growth helped blow a £25 billion hole in income tax receipts for the last financial year compared with expectations at the time the Coalition came to power, the Government's budget watchdog said today.

Britain's deficit of £108billion for 2013-14 was £48 billion larger than predicted by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in June 2010.

In an evaluation of its earlier forecasts, the OBR said the single largest factor in its over-optimistic prediction was the shortfall in income tax.

The body said this reflected lower wages and salaries and a lower effective tax rate on that income - with the level of tax-free personal allowances increasing. 

National Insurance contributions were also £7.4 billion below forecast. 

'According to HMRC's own assessment, the amount of uncollected tax rose again last year and has now gone up by £3 billion on George Osborne's watch.

'At a time when working people face a cost-of-living crisis, our NHS is going backwards and the deficit is still high, it's even more vital that everyone pays their fair share of tax.

'Labour has set out a clear approach to tackling tax avoidance, including measures to help raise revenues for our National Health Service. In contrast, George Osborne is failing to tackle the tax gap while giving the top one per cent of earners a £3 billion a year tax cut.' 

It came on the day HMRC said it would close another 14 offices and cut more than 400 jobs.

The Public and Commercial Services Union claimed that more than 1,000 jobs would be lost – and warned it did not make economic sense to impose cuts on the department that should be collecting revenue.

Chas Roy-Chowdhury, of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, said ordinary people were ‘an easier target’ than those who set out to cheat the system.

Almost £24billion of the tax gap was from businesses – suggesting that the Government must tackle the complex tax-avoidance schemes used by multinational corporations.

Shabana Mahmood MP, a Labour Treasury spokesman, said yesterday: ‘These damning figures show that this Government is totally failing to tackle tax avoidance and evasion.’

But David Gauke, the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said that since 2010-11 the percentage tax gap has been lower than under Labour.

He said: ‘Today’s figures show that there’s still more work to do but our continued drive to tackle avoidance means that avoidance is down.

‘The UK has one of the lowest tax gaps in the world.’
