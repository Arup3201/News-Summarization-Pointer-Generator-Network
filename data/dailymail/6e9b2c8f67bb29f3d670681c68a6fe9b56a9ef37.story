Olympic hopeful: Julian Hughes-John, 31, has been jailed for 12 years for kidnap and grievous bodily harm

A ‘dangerous’ former Olympic hopeful has been jailed for 12 years after kidnapping and torturing a man for money.

Disgraced Julian Hughes-John, 31, who represented Great Britain in its Bobsleigh team throughout Europe, was part of a trio who bundled their victim into a van whilst brandishing a shotgun and wearing balaclavas, before hammering a drill bit into his ankle.

The gang were caught after a passing police car spotted the suspicious van parked in Selsey Road, Luton, Bedfordshire on March 24 last year and stopped to speak to the driver.

The van pulled away, before stopping further down the road, where the three men fled.

When they checked the vehicle, officers were shocked to find a 32-year-old man tied up inside.

The culprits were later caught and arrested.

Hughes-John, from Luton, was found guilty of kidnap and grievous bodily harm with 
intent and yesterday sentenced to 12 years in prison with a public 
protection order, meaning he will be on licence for a minimum of ten 
years after he has completed his sentence, half of which must be served 
in custody.

The court 
heard how, after being imprisoned ten years ago for his part in an armed
 robbery, Hughes-John turned his life around through sport, being 
selected to compete in the British bob-sleigh team across Europe.

But
 after the U.S refused him a visa to enter the country and compete, 
because of his violent history, he turned back to a life of crime.

Judge David Farrell QC told the defendants during sentencing yesterday (Thursday) that it was a calculated and ruthless attack which left a man fearing for his life.

He said: 'This was a carefully planned and ruthlessly executed kidnapping.

'It
 was a significantly serious and violent assault in which you 
deliberately incapacitated the victim to prevent him escaping, perhaps 
in order to tell you where the money was.

'It was only because of the timely 
arrival of the police that this was bought to an end. The victim feared 
what else might have happened to him, had they not passed by.”

He added that the victim has suffered serious psychological effects since the 25-minute long attack.

The court heard how the three had targeted their victim, believing he had access to substantial amounts of money.

They
 had even followed the victim’s girlfriend earlier in the day, before 
waiting for him near to her house and pouncing on him as he got out of 
his car.

Addressing Hughes-John, the judge added: 'After managing to rebuild your life, your willingness to return to crime at such a ruthless and serious level when things did not work out satisfies me that there is a strong risk to the public of serious harm.

'You are a person who is cool, calculated and can use your intelligence in a way that can and does present a real danger to the public.

'I am therefore imposing a public protection order on you.'

Dean Raeside, aged 23, from Stephens Close, Luton, was found guilty of the same offences and was jailed for 12 years, and must serve a minimum of six years in prison.

Dean Wright, aged 27, from Rivergate House, Luton, the driver of the van, pleaded guilty to kidnap and was convicted of GBH with intent. He was sentenced to 11 years, half of which will be served in custody.

Both were spared public protection orders.

A fourth man believed to be involved in the attack was not captured.
