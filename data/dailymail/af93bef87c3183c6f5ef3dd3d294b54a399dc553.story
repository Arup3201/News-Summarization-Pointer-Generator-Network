Legendary wrestler and reality TV-star Hulk Hogan has been the victim of theft, after a 'heavyset' woman stole one of his shoes.

The thief got her hands on an $5,500 autographed wrestling shoe, once worn by Hogan, at his own shop in Clearwater Beach, Florida.

The woman and three friends visited Hogan's Beach Shop late Sunday afternoon, and took the shoe while staff were distracted.

However, it was not until Tuesday that
 staff noticed that the expensive piece of Hulk Hogan memorabilia was 
missing and reported it to the police after checking CCTV.

A
 police report states that four white females, possibly from Michigan on
 spring break, came into Hogan's Beach Shop on Sunday just after 5pm.

A few minutes later, a large statue of Hogan fell over outside, and 
while store workers were temporarily distracted 'a heavyset white female
 in her 50's' helped herself to the shoe, Clearwater Police say.

Hogan, 60, recently announced his return to WWE after more than six years absence.

He appeared on WWE Raw Backstage Pass last month, and will also host
 the special anniversary of WrestleMania 30 in New Orleans in April.
