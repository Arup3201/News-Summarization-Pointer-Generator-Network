Global power: Vladimir Putin said the new group could compete for influence with the USA, Europe and Asia

Vladimir Putin has raised fears of a revival of the USSR after he revealed plans to create a so-called ‘Eurasian Union’ of former Soviet nations.

The Russian prime minister  – who is all but certain to regain the presidency next year – wants the bloc to become ‘one of the poles of the modern world’, and a rival to the United States, the European Union and Asia.

In the past, Mr Putin has lamented the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 as the ‘greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century’. But he denies the Kremlin’s proposed new alliance is an attempt to rebuild Russia’s  old communist empire.

Instead, Mr Putin – who has effectively led the country for more than a decade, first as president and now as prime minister – claims the union would merely act as ‘an efficient link between Europe and the dynamic Asia-Pacific region’.

His assurances will do little to convince some ex-Soviet nations, however, many of whom are already suspicious of the Kremlin’s intentions.

Alexander Dugin, a political scholar, said the ‘Eurasian Union’ would become one of Mr Putin’s chief policies as president.

He added: ‘From the geopolitical viewpoint it represents an attempt to revive the USSR.’

But announcing the plans in a Russian newspaper, Mr Putin claimed: ‘There is no talk about rebuilding the USSR in one  way or another. It would be naive  to try to restore or copy something that belongs to the past, but a close integration based on new values and economic and political foundation is a demand of the present time.’

Empire-building: Vladimir Putin has mourned the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union

Dominant: A map from 1986 shows the span of the former Soviet Union, which incorporates cities such as Tblisi, Talin and Donetsk, which are now the capital cities of Georgia, Estonia and the Ukraine

Near collapse: Three years later, however, the USSR's borders had retreated

The concept of Eurasia, the huge area
of land mass comprising Russia and some of its European and North Asian
neighbours, was first featured in George Orwell's dystopian fantasy 
1984.

Under Orwell's 
vision of a Totalitarian dystopia after the Second World War, the UK 
falls into civil war and is integrated to Oceania, a society ruled by 
the dictatorship of 'the Party'.

At the same time, the USSR annexed continental Europe and created the second superstate of Eurasia.

The novel's third state, Eastasia is made of large regions of East Asia and Southeast Asia.

The
novel describes the story of Winston Smith, who records how the world's
three superstates are constantly fighting for the unconquered lands of 
the world.

Smith 
recounts the Atomic Wars fought in western Russia, North America and 
Europe, and describes how 'the Party' referred to the postwar 
reorganisation of society as 'the Revolution'.

Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan have 
already formed an economic alliance to remove customs barriers between 
the countries, and now  Mr Putin is pushing for Kyrgyzstan and 
Tajikistan to join, too.

In January, the group will adopt unified market rules.

He said: ‘We aren’t going to stop at 
that and are putting forward an ambitious task of reaching a new, higher
level of integration with the Eurasian Union.

‘Along with other key players and 
regional structures, such as the European Union, the United States, 
China and the Asia Pacific Economic Community, it should ensure 
stability of global development.’

But Mr Putin’s plans are likely to 
meet with fierce opposition from some of his prospective ‘Eurasian 
Union’ partners, who are far keener to forge closer ties with Europe 
than their old communist masters.

Last month Ukrainian president Viktor
Yanukovych complained that the Kremlin was trying to coerce his country
into joining the new customs union.

And the Russian government has also 
caused tensions with Belarus – one of its closest allies – after it 
tried to gain a huge stake in its top state-controlled industrial 
assets, a move Belarus has strongly resisted.

Mr Putin served as Russia’s president
from 2000 to 2008, when he was frequently accused of undoing the former
communist state’s transition to democracy.

He only stepped down – to make way 
for his protege, Dmitry Medvedev – because rules barred him from serving
a third consecutive term.

By becoming prime minister he has 
remained Russia’s leader in all but name, and is likely to regain the 
presidency in elections next March. Mr Medvedev has already proposed 
that he should run
