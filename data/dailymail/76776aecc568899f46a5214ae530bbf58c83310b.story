Fulfilling the dream of every little girl to own a pony, professional horsewoman Zara Phillips has generously gifted her two-year-old niece with a Shetland pony.

The Queen’s eldest granddaughter, who is an equestrian Olympic silver medalist from the British eventing team is clearly keen to pass on her own love of riding to little Savannah.

The two-year-old. the Queen's great-granddaughter, is the eldest child of Zara’s brother Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn, and sister to one year old Isla.

Zara has given her two-year-old niece Savannah (right) a Shetland pony, perhaps hoping to pass on her own love of horses to the next generation

Zara checked that Savannah was enjoying herself at the Badminton Horse Trials earlier this month

Despite her young age, Savannah is apparently already enamored with her gift.

According to reports in The Telegraph her father Peter said: ‘Zara was insistent on giving her a little Shetland pony.

‘Savannah loves riding him. So yes, it seems we’ve passed the 'horse gene’ on to the next generation.’

The Shetland pony is a miniature breed of pony originating in the Shetland Isles, ranging in height from around 28 inches to 11 hands, making them perfect for small rider.

It is not clear exactly what prompted the 32 year-old royal to make such a generous gift, but a love of riding and horses traditionally runs right through the heart of the royal family, particularly the women.

Zara’s nieces are already some of her biggest fans when it comes to her riding career.

Both girls joined their parents at the Badminton Horse Trials earlier this month. 

The 31-year old equestrian's brother Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn took both their young daughters Savannah, two, and one-year-old Isla to watch their aunt compete

Savannah, two, looked particularly enamored as she watched her aunt ride, and now with her own pony she can begin to foster the 'horse gene' herself

Zara, who attended the Chelsea Flower show last week and cut the cake as the show celebrates its 100th birthday (right) is obviously very close to her niece Savannah (seen on her father Peter's shoulders, left)

The girls, who are 12th and 13th in line for the throne, played in the sunshine as they watched their aunt Zara, compete.

Zara, who is married to English rugby player Mike Tindall, posted a dressage score of 44.3 penalties at the event that kept her firmly in touch with the leading group.

However despite her success in the sport, the young royal has not been shirking her other royal duties.

She, like other members of the Royal family including Princes Charles and Harry and the Queen, attended the Chelsea Flower Show last week.

Though she confessed she is not a big gardener herself, she spoke of how he grandmother is an inspiration to her

Zara says: ‘When you've got such inspirational ladies in your family, it's kind of hard not to be like that. My grandmother's like that, and her mother before her, and my mum.’

And now it looks like little Savannah is set to follow in the (pony) steps of the Windsor women.
