Andi Dorfman looked very put together on Tuesday, the day after it was announced she chose former baseball player Josh Murray as her fiancé on ABC's hit reality series The Bachelorette.

The 27-year-old lawyer glowed as she showed off her diamond Neil Lane engagement ring to Kelly Ripa on Live With Kelly & Michael.

Her good spirits were impressive considering less than 12 hours earlier in Los Angeles, the brunette beauty suffered a major embarrassment when the runner up Nick Viall told the audience at the After The Final Rose ceremony that they had 'made love' in the Fantasy Suite.

The happy couple working the morning shows: On Tuesday Andi Dorfman and fiancé Josh Murray glowed as they appeared on Live With Kelly & Michael

It's a stunner: The 27-year-old showed off her Neil Lane rock, which is three carats and set in platinum

Andi was quick to address the 33-year-old's loose lips during the segment, which aired after she was seen handing out the final rose.

'First of all, I think that's kind of 
below the belt and something that should be kept private,' she offered. 'The things I told you were real. The way I 
kissed you, those things were real.'

Sales account executive Viall also claimed he was 'completely blindsided' by the attorney's rejection.

'It's hard to misread some [little things],' he said. 'A lot of that stuff off camera … [like] when you tell someone
 you love them and they say "I wish I could say things back" – you're 
not supposed to assume things, but there's not much room for 
interpretation.'

The looker
 also addressed Viall's bold admission - he is the first contestant who 
has shared on ATFR that he got between the sheets in the Fantasy Suite -
 while on Good Morning America earlier in the day.

Not a bad time in her life: The attorney said she was enjoying being engaged and being able to talk about it as she sat down with Kelly Ripa and Michael Strahan

Andi, You lit me up. You made me feel those things that people go a lifetime to find, and I feel like I made you feel the same. I truly hoped we would have made it into the real world, where there would be no arbitrary deadline, where those stresses that came with that environment would have melted away, where we could have had the goofy, fun, exciting relationship that I know we could have. What we had was real to me, and it was amazing.

I fully realize that in the end I could have been wrong about what we had. While it’s hard to accept, I totally realize that it's a possibility. With that being said, when I think about the relationship that we had, very few things in my life have felt more real… I think about that moment when you ended things and what you said to me. I believe you when you said something didn’t feel right with us when you woke up that morning, but I wonder if what didn’t feel right was really about us and our relationship. I wonder if it would have been different if that night you thought about us with your heart and not with your head. Let’s just call it what it was--our relationship was very much the road less traveled. I totally get that all the passion, intensity, and connections that we had were accompanied by fear and sometimes discomfort. There is a reason why very few are willing to take the road less traveled. It can be scary, challenging, and risky, but if you have the courage to take it, it usually ends up being amazing.

'That's always the tough part,' Dorfman 
said.

'That's kind of the nature of the 
beast with the show. I had to break up with 24 guys in order to get the 
one I really wanted and needed.

'It's always a little uncomfortable when 
you have to watch the breakups and talk about them.'

Viall also wrote a letter to Dorfman which was posted on the Bachelorette Facebook page.

He discussed how he hoped they 'would have made it into the real world' and said there may have been 'fear and discomfort' that came with their 'passion.'

He added, 'What we had was real to me, and it was amazing.'

Viall finished with, 'There is a reason why very few are 
willing to take the road less traveled. It can be scary, challenging, 
and risky, but if you have the courage to take it, it usually ends up 
being amazing.'

'There's really not much to talk about,' Andi said on GMA.

'It's obviously something I read, but I'm very happy in
 my relationship. It's like reopening the past that doesn't need to be 
reopened. We moved past that.'

But the reality princess - who held hands with her 29-year-old fiancé as they walked on the set of GMA - soon changed the subject back to her happy news.

She told host Lara Spencer: 'I definitely knew there was that 
chemistry and attraction with him,' Dorfman declared of her future husband.

'I'm definitely an overthinker, though, so it took me till the 
very end. But there was something special with him.'

She also discussed her wedding. 'We would like to do something in the spring,' she allowed.

Not an easy talk: The brunette beauty on After The Final Rose on Monday with runner-up Nick Viall

In poor taste?: Viall shared that he had 'made love' to Andi in the Fantasy Suite; she was not happy with his comment

'I
 think for now, it's like, I finally got the engagement ring, I'm just 
going to enjoy this for a little while… Just enjoy engagement life!'

And what a ring it is. The Neil Lane creation has a center stone that consists of three carats with 154 round diamonds surrounding it. The setting is platinum.

The jeweler told People on Monday, 'Josh wanted to get a pretty, feminine, soft-shaped ring, with a bit of glamor and wow effect. When Josh saw it, he knew this was the one. He said he could see it on Andi. He could see himself proposing with it.'

He dropped to one knee: The Atlanta native proposed to the ABC star and she seemed shocked as she cupped her hands to her mouth

That's a yes: The TV star accepted the proposal and sealed the engagement with a kiss on the lips

Nice ice: Though the ring could be seen on Monday's episode of The Bachelorette, it didn't get its chance to sparkle until Andi showed it off the next day in New York City

Murray also opened his heart on the news show.

'I knew she was very intelligent, but she is so funny,' he said. 'She's beautiful. I was intimidated when I first got out of that limo, for sure.'

The two have already gone to their social media accounts to gush about each other.

Hand in hand: Andi wore a flirty gold skirt, black tank top and gold heels as she walked out of their Good Morning America taping on Tuesday

'Finally able to shout it from the rooftops!!' Dorfman captioned an Instagram shot of herself with her love.

'Amazing season, amazing guy! One lucky girl. I love you more than you will ever know @joshmurray11 #thebachelorette.'

'Meet my beautiful fiancé and the love of my life @andi_dorfman,' Murray wrote. 'I've waited 29 years to find her and it's been well worth the wait! God is soooooo great! #VeryBlessed #ForeverKindOfLove.'

On Tuesday Andi was seen in three different outfits for her post-Bachelorette press appearances.

First she wore black and gold for GMA then switched into a beige dress for Live.

Later she was seen in red as she went to an office building with Josh.

Her third glam outfit of the day: Andi was also seen in a red romper and beige heels as she clung to her beau

They can't stop smiling: The pair seemed more than thrilled to be able to shared their affection in public as they were seen hand in hand leaving a building in Manhattan

Before their appearance: The future Mr and Mrs Murray wore casual clothing after they flew in from Los Angeles to make the rounds on the chat shows in New York City
