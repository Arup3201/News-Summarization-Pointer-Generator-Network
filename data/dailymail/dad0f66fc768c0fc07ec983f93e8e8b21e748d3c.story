Southampton winger Lloyd Isgrove has joined Sheffield Wednesday on an emergency loan deal until the end of the season.

The pacy 22-year-old, is another product of the club's famed youth academy, and joins The Owls soon after signing a new two-year-contract extension at St Mary's. 

The Wales Under-21 international has made four appearances for the Southampton first-team this season and came off the bench in their opening game of the campaign against Liverpool at Anfield.

Wednesday, who are managed by one-time Southampton manager Stuart Gray, are currently 12th in the Sky Bet Championship table with nine games left to go.

Isgrove joins his new club in time for a possible debut in Saturday's Yorkshire derby away at Rotherham United. 

Les Reed, Southampton's director of football, told Saintsfc.co.uk: 'This is a great opportunity for Lloyd to demonstrate his prowess at a Championship club and get some more valuable first-team experience.'  

Southampton director of football Les Reed hopes that Isgrove will benefit from playing regularly on loan
