Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is reportedly ready to move on after the sad death of his former wife, and marry his actress girlfriend Cheryl Hines.

According to  Radar Online, the environmental lawyer, 58, is planning to propose to Hines, 47, who is famous for playing Larry David's wife in Curb Your Enthusiasm.

Kennedy's second wife, Mary, was found hanging in the family barn in Bedford, New York, in May this year - he had filed for divorce in 2010.

'Robert has already bought an absolutely stunning engagement ring and is now in the stages of planning the perfect scenario in which to propose to Cheryl,' a source said.

'He knows she is the woman he wants to spend the rest of his life with and he wants to seal the deal as soon as possible and prove to her how serious he is.'

The source claims that 'Robert is aware that it hasn't even been a year yet since Mary killed herself and he doesn't want Cheryl to be subjected to any negative backlash, she's an innocent party in this whole mess and he wants to shield her from any criticism as much as humanly possible.'

Radar adds: 'His and Mary's divorce was 
close to being finalized at the time of her death, and Robert says he 
would have likely already married Cheryl by now if he didn't have to 
deal with the suicide and its aftermath.

'Although he accepts that publicly he has to maintain an appearance of mourning, he points out that their marriage had been over for a long time at the time of Mary's death and he is more than ready to move on now and marry again.'

There was bitter acrimony following Mary's suicide. Kennedy sent his 16-year-old daughter Kyra, one of couple's four children, to live with Hines in Los Angeles.

He then had Mary's body exhumed and moved to a more remote part of the same graveyard.

It was reported Mary had been struggling 
with depression, had doubts about her future, financial problems and 
difficulties dealing with the bitter divorce from Kennedy. He had 
started a new and media-friendly relationship with actress Hines.

Radar Online claims: 'Robert doesn't want to appear to be insensitive, but he believes he has the right to get on with his life, and his relationship with Cheryl is an integral part of that.

'He has discussed his intention to marry again with his family but hasn't broached the issue with his kids yet.

'Robert is confident though that they will accept it and be happy for him, and if that's not the case he maintains that they will eventually learn to accept it.'
