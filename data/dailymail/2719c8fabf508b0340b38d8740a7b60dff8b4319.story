When a group of nine students got stuck in a lift at university, there was only one thing they could do.

And Aerosmith's I Don't Want to Miss A Thing was the answer.

A video shot from outside the lift records the group of nine students from the University of West England in Bristol singing the 1998 hit - a possibly apt  choice as they spent more than an hour trapped inside. 

The nine students sang their own enthusiastic rendition as they waited to be rescued form the lift at Mendip Court of the Frenchay Campus.

From the singing and giggling in the video they appear unfazed by being trapped, although one of the female students apparently got distressed as they continued to wait to be rescued.

Several students took to social networking site Reddit on Saturday to post about the incident and the singing. 

Writing on Reddit one of the students who was trapped said: 'I was one of the guys stuck in this lift haha, it's Mendip Court on Frenchay Campus at UWE in Bristol.

'Everyone was pretty drunk so it was just funny, although we were stuck in there for over an hour so by the end one girl was panicking quite a bit.'

The video was uploaded on Saturday. 

The students said they were at the Frenchay Campus of the university, which has accommodation for almost 2,000 people. 

A spokeswoman for the University said: 'The lift was slightly overloaded and was stuck for an hour. It is now fixed.' 

The students recorded their own version of the Aerosmith song, from inside the lift where they were trapped
