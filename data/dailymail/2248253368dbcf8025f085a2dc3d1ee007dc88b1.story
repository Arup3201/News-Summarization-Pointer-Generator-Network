Rachel Reeves: Labour frontbencher is set for a Cabinet role if Ed Miliband wins the election in May

Labour frontbencher Rachel Reeves today hit back at claims she could not handle being in the Cabinet while having a baby. 

She hopes to become Work and Pensions Secretary if Ed Miliband wins power in May.

But she is due to have her second baby just five weeks later, on 15 June, and will begin her maternity leave before that.

Tory MP Andrew Rosindell questioned whether becoming a mother means she will be able to give her job her 'full attention'.

But Miss Reeves rejected the suggestion, writing on Twitter: '300,000 women a year take maternity leave but Andrew Rosindell thinks can't do big job & be a mum. Tory women problem?' 

The row erupted after Miss Reeves, 36, said she believes she would have time to abolish the housing benefit under-occupancy charge – known as the 'bedroom tax' – before she goes on maternity leave until September.

'Yes. I'm having a child, and I shall be on maternity leave for the early weeks and months of the next government,' she said in an interview at the weekend.

She added that she had already planned her first moves if Labour is in government and she takes over at Work and Pensions.

'The first thing I would do is to abolish the bedroom tax,' she said, referring to the Coalition's controversial policy of cutting housing benefit for council tenants with a spare room so their rent is not fully covered, meaning they have to pay the shortfall or move.

'That's something I can do really quickly. My baby's due in June, and I want to cancel the bedroom tax before I go on maternity leave. That would be a great start for when I come back in September.'

Despite her heavy workload, Miss Reeves, who is married to civil servant Nick Joicey, does not have a nanny or any formal childcare and mainly relies on her mother and aunt. Speaking about her childcare arrangements, she added: 'I do make sure I get things done; that I've sorted out the shopping and that there's food in the fridge.'

Miss Reeves, a fast-rising Labour star since she was elected in 2010, has been tipped as a successor to Ed Miliband as Labour leader.

She is currently work and pensions spokesman, shadowing Iain Duncan Smith.

Miss Reeves took to Twitter to hit back at criticism of the idea of taking maternity leave from the Cabinet

But in an interview at the weekend, the Leeds West MP, who has a one-year-old daughter, ruled herself out of taking over if Labour loses the election.

'I think Ed is going to win and I hope that I will be in his first Cabinet, so that's not a scenario I have given any thought to,' she said.

Tory MP Andrew Rosindell said last night: 'I don't want to say someone who is having a baby is not eligible to be a Cabinet minister, but I certainly think perhaps the demands of that particular job will require someone to give it their full attention.

'I don't expect Rachel Reeves to be in the Cabinet after the election because I expect the Conservatives to win, but clearly people need to be put in the positions they can handle.'

David Cameron's official spokesman also dismissed suggestions that pregnant women should not be appointed to the Cabinet.

Asked whether the Prime Minister believed a pregnant woman could serve in the Cabinet, the spokesman told a regular Westminster media briefing: 'Why on Earth not?'

The spokesman added: 'The Prime Minister's views around maternity leave (entitlements) is that they are universal, they apply to everyone and it is entirely a matter for individual families to take the decisions that they think are right for them, and the Government's job is to support them in those decisions they take.'

Next in line? Miss Reeves, a fast-rising Labour star since she was elected in 2010, has been tipped as a successor to Ed Miliband, left,  as Labour leader. But Tory MP Andrew Rosindell questioned whether she could give the job her full attention

Miss Reeves is expected to be Labour's public face of the General Election campaign with regular TV appearances.

She has been pushed forward by Mr Miliband, becoming shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in 2011, before being promoted to shadow work and pensions secretary in 2013.

After studying politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford, state-educated Miss Reeves's first job was as an economist at the Bank of England.

She took five months' maternity leave from Parliament after her first child was born in March 2013, returning to work in early September after the summer recess.

A week after her return, she faced embarrassment following an appearance on BBC2's Newsnight when its editor Ian Katz sent a tweet calling her 'boring snoring Rachel Reeves'. He had intended it as a private direct message but instead it was tweeted publicly. 

At the time, Miss Reeves said she was particularly aggrieved about the comment because she had agreed to be interviewed even though she had a new baby.

She said: 'I thought, I've just been on your programme at 11 o'clock at night, I've got a tiny baby at home, I could have been at home. I just felt humiliated.'

Liberal Democrat equalities minister Jo Swinson was criticised last year for taking six months' maternity leave. She complained of the lack of support for mothers, such as 'bizarre' rulings banning MPs from taking babies through the voting lobby.

Miss Swinson said new mothers may need to breastfeed during all night votes and debates.

'I hardly think it would be too much of a disruption,' she said. 'You can take a sword through there but you can't a baby. I think we need to get away from this guilt culture in terms of judging other people's decisions as parents.'

Desperate Ed Miliband brings back Two Jags

By Jack Doyle, Political Correspondent for the Daily Mail 

Veteran: John Prescott is to return to frontline politics as a climate change adviser to Ed Miliband

John Prescott is to return to frontline politics as a climate change adviser to Ed Miliband.

But the move, widely seen as an attempt by the Labour leader to fend off the threat of Ukip by shoring up working-class votes, was greeted with widespread derision.

The appointment of Lord Prescott – dubbed Two Jags – came as a second poll in a week put the Tories ahead of Labour. The Opinium survey for the Observer had the Conservatives up two points on 35 per cent and Labour down two on 33.

Senior Labour figures admitted Lord Prescott, 76, would play a significant campaigning role ahead of the election.

The appointment of the veteran bruiser – during the 2001 election campaign he famously punched a protester who threw an egg at him in North Wales – came as a surprise. He recently criticised Mr Miliband's 'far too timid' approach. 'He might as well have said at the end of his conference speech, 'Go back to your constituencies and prepare for coalition',' Lord Prescott said in October.

He was deputy leader of the Labour Party for 13 years and deputy Prime Minister under Tony Blair until he resigned in 2007. He earned the sobriquet Two Jags after it emerged he owned one and had a second as his ministerial car.

In 1999, he was criticised for driving the 200 yards from his hotel to the Labour Party conference venue. He blamed the need to protect his wife Pauline's hair.

In 2006 he took a chauffeur-driven Jaguar the 200 yards from his hotel to speak on global warming at a US conference At the time he said he was 'fully focused' on saving the planet. That year it also emerged that he had a two-year affair with his secretary Tracey Temple, a divorcee 24 years his junior.

On BBC1's Andrew Marr show yesterday, former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell denied Lord Prescott's return was 'terrifying' but admitted Mr Miliband's personal poll ratings were 'not good'.

Former Blair aide Matthew Taylor told Sky News that Lord Prescott was 'probably past the stage of punching people'.

Mr Miliband said he was bringing back the veteran because he 'knows how to knock heads together'. Lord Prescott will advise him ahead of the UN climate change conference in Paris later this year, he said.

Lord Prescott was the lead EU negotiator during the talks which led to the 1997 Kyoto agreement on reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

Labour foreign affairs spokesman Douglas Alexander said Lord Prescott was one of the party's strongest campaigners. He said: 'The role and brief that John's been given right now is to focus on climate change but I fully expect that as well as that policy role, he'll continue to support the Labour campaign in the months ahead.'

Tory MP Nigel Mills said: 'So, Labour appoints the man who spent his ministerial career swanning around in two gas-guzzling Jaguars to be their adviser on climate change? Another dud appointment from weak Ed Miliband who's got a man who crashed the economy running the shadow Treasury and a deputy leader who thinks the way to attract the female vote is daubing her campaign material in pink.'

Ukip's Nigel Farage mocked the appointment, telling Radio 4: 'I think they're a bit short of talent.'

Yesterday's Opinium Poll shows Labour has fallen 11 points since the end of 2012. It follows an ICM poll for the Guardian which put the Tories on 36 per cent and Labour on 32. Opinium's Adam Drummond said the recovering economy was boosting the Coalition's ratings.
