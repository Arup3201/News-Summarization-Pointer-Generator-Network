Fancy dress festival Bestival is one of the fashion pack's favourite summer parties.

Guests are encouraged to get creative and let their imaginations run wild on the big dress up day, and anything goes for the rest of the weekend too.

This year's theme was nautical as HMS Bestival set sail for four days of wild partying and crazy outfits, and with Elton John captaining the talent there were plenty of sequins, bling and feathers on display next to the stripes and sailors hats.

Femail was there to capture some of the best-dressed characters as well as some more wearable looks away from the dressing up box. Plus we spent time with style sponsors and denim experts Replay to get new season wardobe tips on reusing your summer denim. Chic ahoy.

Bastille backstage at the Replay tent

As well as being a festival staple denim is an essential must have for the new season being part of key trends including grunge, boy and biker.

Replay combined their denim and music expertise at Bestival, dressing acts including Disclosure, Bastille, Sam Smith and London Grammar.

MailOnline asked the experts at the Italian brand how we should be wearing our jeans for autumn:

'For women, the base fit is skinny, made more appealing and on-trend by biker fastenings. Today's hot shape, the boyfriend style, becomes more feminine, with all its masculine appeal and comfort at the front, but a new fit at the back that is more flattering for female curves. Finally, again for her, sophisticated jeans are back with their fabulous internal tailoring.

'The collection in brief includes jeans with old 3D effect dye, big on the used finish, which look as if they have been worn for days; jeans with a leather effect, bleached and then re-dyed with an obvious coating; pearly jeans in their three colour variants, glittering with tiny gemstones and super-feminine; jeans marbled with natural earth, uneven dirty patches; jeans in all shades from black to grey and finally top-coated garment-dyed jeans.'
