He’s old enough to be her grandfather and spent almost a decade in prison for political corruption.

But that hasn’t put Trina Grimes Scott, 32, off former Louisiana governor Edwin Edwards, 83, as she has agreed to accept his hand in marriage.

Mr Edwards attended his first public event on Tuesday since completing his jail sentence, with his beautiful blonde fiancé, to the awe of onlookers.

He was befriended by Miss Scott during an eight-year prison sentence followed by six months in home confinement, which he finished this month.

They became engaged despite the 51-year age gap, but he said at the awards dinner this week: ‘A man is only as old as the woman he feels.’

Mr Edwards is a twice-divorced great-grandfather who served 16 years as Louisiana governor and has been with Miss Scott for around a year.

He was speaking on Tuesday night at the Foundation for Historical Louisiana awards dinner in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

He was married to Elaine for 40 years before a 1989 divorce and later married Candy in 1994 before they divorced when he was in jail in 2004.

Miss Scott wrote on Facebook that her new fiancé is ‘such a pleasure to take care of’, reported The Times-Picayune last month.

Tuesday marked his first public appearance since his sentence for bribery and extortion related to the award of state casino gambling licenses.

‘I really feel like I came out of prison more popular than I went in,’ he said.

Not so happy: Mr Edwards arrives at the Ecumenical House, a halfway house, to begin serving the remainder of his sentence in January 2011

‘I think in some part because people realise that an injustice occurred and that I handled it like a man. I took it. I survived. I said that I would walk out, and I did.’

He was at the event where his biographer, Leo Honeycutt, and others were being honoured for their work in historic preservation.

Shaun Sanghani, a TV producer who is in discussions with Edwards about starting a new reality show, was also there.

‘I've never seen a reality show, but I hear about them,’ Mr Edwards said.

‘I want to assure everyone that if we have one there will be nothing in it that's embarrassing to my state or to me or my family.’
