Two pimps who were part of a gang which used university rooms to run a brothel in a major sex trafficking operation have been jailed for more than five years in total.

Csaba Safian, 33, was part of a gang that brought 53 women as young as 17 from a poor part of Hungary to work as prostitutes in the UK.

A court heard the group ran brothels from various locations, including a room in student accommodation during the holidays at the University of Sussex’s Falmer Campus, East Sussex.

Safian also operated from a property in Eastbourne, East Sussex, where he put his name to the tenancy.

He was jailed yesterday alongside fellow gang member Sandor Mohacsi, 35, after both defendants pleaded guilty to conspiring to traffic women into the UK for sexual exploitation between March 2011 and October 2012.

Prosecutor Amy Packham told Hove 
Crown Court that a Hungarian woman travelled with Safian 
to Eastbourne to work in the brothel.

She
 had previously agreed to see ten clients per day for £100. But on
 her first day, she had sex with more men than agreed.

The
 court heard that when the woman complained to Safian, he responded that
 she was ‘a newbie, and fresh meat, and things would quieten down'.

Ms
 Packham said the girl was not physically forced to stay in the brothel,
 but could not afford to fly home and was often spoken to in a way that 
made it clear she should stay.

She was even chaperoned by gang members when she went outside, the court heard.

The court heard that Mohacsi, 35, helped to drive the girls between hotels and airports.

The empire was only uncovered when a 
building manager at the University of Sussex received an email 
advertising sex services in March 2011.

He recognised the distinctive blue and yellow curtains from the halls of residence and uncovered a makeshift brothel on campus.

A
 spokesman for the University of Sussex said the gang were discovered 
using the two-bedroom flat during the Easter holidays.

They gained 
access without the knowledge of the student who had rented it. He was 
away for the break.

Hove Crown Court heard the women were advertised as 'fresh meat' on a website and were threatened with exposure if they fled. The defendants were jailed for two years and eight months at the court

Five other members of the gang were jailed in January after a trial. During that trial, it emerged the 
group made £20,000 a week from prostitutes holed up in hotels, brothels 
and even a university halls of residence.

Women as young as 17 were flown to Britain on EasyJet and Wizz Air flights and forced to have sex with up to 15 men a day.

Many were recruited from deprived parts of Hungary and told they would be working in the massage industry.

They were then put up in hotels around Gatwick, in flats across the South East, Bristol, Norwich, Manchester, Leeds, Cardiff and Glasgow, as well as the halls of residence at the University of Sussex.

Women were advertised on sex websites as 'fresh meat' and threatened with exposure at home if they fled.

The gang collected £100 an hour but kept most of the money for themselves while refusing to hand back passports until the women had paid off their 'debts', the court was told.

The gang moved the brothel from Eastbourne to Woolwich in November 2011, after police visited the seaside address.

Mitigating, Safian’s lawyer Richard McConaghy suggested his client had been ‘used’ to put his name on documents and was low in the gang’s hierarchy.

But Judge Richard Hayward said the women were tricked after being ‘willing to come to the UK thinking they would better their lives’.

He sentenced each defendant to two years and eight months in jail.
