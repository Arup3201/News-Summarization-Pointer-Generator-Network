Suing: Christopher Dietz says his construction business has lost $300,000 over the negative review on Yelp

A judge in Virginia has ordered a woman to change her negative Yelp review about a building contractor after the business won a key legal battle.

Jane Perez was slapped with a $750,000 
lawsuit by Dietz Development after she publicly logged complaints about 
construction work the company performed on her home.

In her write-ups on the popular business
 review sites Yelp and Angie's List, Perez accused the company of 
damaging her house, trespassing and stealing jewelry.

On Wednesday, Judge Thomas FortKort granted a temporary injunction in favor of Dietz Development and ordered Perez to change parts of her online review to remove the reference to the stolen jewelry.

'I found my jewelry missing and Dietz was the only one with a key,' Perez wrote in the review.

A police investigation found no connection between the missing jewelry and Dietz or his company.

Perez was also ordered to change a reference to a previous lawsuit filed by Dietz because it included incorrect legal terminology.

James T Bacon, Perez's attorney, told MailOnline that ruling amounted to the judge 'copy editing' Perez's online review.

'Obviously this is very chilling to free speech because folks are going to be very concerned and afraid to voice their opinions about businesses,' he said.

'We believe that these sites are the forum where we should be encouraged to write about our experiences with businesses.'

Review: Perez posted a negative review on the popular site Yelp, as well as Angie's List, another business review site

Dietz lawyer, though, said the ruling aims to correct ongoing harm to Dietz's reputation that he has suffered from from false accusations.

'A bad review is one thing. But, it was a bad review that accused him of theft. And in this residential construction, commercial construction business - that’s a devastating accusation,' attorney Milton Johns said.

Christopher Dietz, the owner of Dietz
 Development, said he had no choice but to file the lawsuit after he lost 
$300,00 when customers fled his business over the review, reports The Washington Post.

'The impact has been awful,' Dietz said. 'There is no one to protect businesses when people slam their name.'

Johns said the case is not about free speech, it's about taking a stand about using lies to defame a local business.

'Defamation has never been protected by the First Amendment,' he said.

Perez's lawyer, Mr Bacon, maintains that everything in the review is demonstrably true and that the judge took issue with only a tiny portion of what she posted online.

Perez is only the latest online critic to find herself in court over negative comments post online.

Jane Perez isn't the only Yelp reviewer to be sued after writing bad things about a business online. Free speech advocates say such cases are on the rise.

In
 2009, a San Francisco man was sued by a chiropractor after he posted a 
Yelp review accusing the business of over-charging him. That suit was settled out of court.

A
 Chicago plastic surgeon sued three women in 2010 after they wrote 
online accusations that he gave them disfigured and misshapen breasts 
after surgery.

In September, a Pilates studio in 
Virginia sued two Yelp reviewers who complained that the business 
smelled like mildew and that the staff was unfriendly. 

Perez, a retired captain in the military, said she never thought she could be sued over something as common as a Yelp review.

'I don’t want to see what happened to me happen to anyone else,' Perez said.

The stakes in the world of online reviews are increasingly high.

Yelp
 is primarily known for restaurant reviews, but it has branched out to 
include listings and customer evaluations for businesses of all kinds.

It has become a review powerhouse, with 84million visitors a month and 33million reviews.

A
 2011 Harvard University study suggested that for each star a restaurant
 received on from reviewers on the site, the restaurant owners could 
expect a 5 to 7percent jump in revenue.

This is the text of Perez's original review posted on Angie's List in August 2012. The bolded portions must be removed from the review after a judge granted a temporary injunction.

Description Of Work: Dietz Development was to perform: painting, refinish floors, electrical, plumbing and handyman work. I was instead left with damage to my home and work that had to be reaccomplished for thousands more than originally estimated.

Member comments: My home was damaged' the "work" had to be re-accomplished; and Dietz tried to sue me for "monies due for his "work." I won in summary judgement (meaning that his case had no merit). Despite his claims, Dietz was/is not licensed to perform work in the state of VA. Further, he invoiced me for work not even performed and also sued me for work not even performed. Today (six months later) he just showed up at my door and '"wanted to talk to me." I said that I "didn't want to talk to him," closed the door , and called the police. (The police said his reason was that he had a "lien on my house"; however this "lien" was made null and void the day I won the case according to the court.) This is after filing my first ever police report when I found my jewelry missing and Dietz was the only one with a key. Bottom line do not put yourself through this nightmare of a contractor.
