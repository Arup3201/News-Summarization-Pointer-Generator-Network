Arsenal players celebrate their second goal of the afternoon against Brighton

BRIGHTON (4-2-3-1) 

David Stockdale - 6

Could do nothing to prevent any of the Arsenal goals. 

Bruno - 6

Tried on a number of occasions to get Brighton going. Many of his team-mates were not on his wavelength though. 

Gordon Greer - 5

Was slow to the ball and poor positioning wise on a number of occasions.

Lewis Dunk (left) endured a difficult afternoon for Brighton as he struggled to cope with the Gunners attak

Lewis Dunk - 4.5

Was caught in no man's land for the first Arsenal goal and gave away possession cheaply in the build up to their all-important third goal.

Joe Bennett - 5

Looked out of his depth and in need of support in the first half. Was exploited down the left-hand side for the first goal.

Danny Holla - 6

Made some useful passes for the hosts but they ultimately came to nothing of note. 

Rohan Ince (far right) impressed at the heart of the Brighton midfield in their narrow defeat

Rohan Ince - 7.5

After a quiet first half, he was very impressive after the interval as Brighton nearly took the game to a replay.

Inigo Calderon - 5

Done little throughout the game. Should have been booked for diving in the first half, too. 

Jake Forster-Caskey - 5.5

Showed some neat footwork but at times it looked as though the occasion got to him.

Sam Baldock - 7

Lovely dinked finish ensured a thrilling finale at the Amex. Also had a decent opportunity to reduce the deficit before the break but fired just over the bar with a thumping effort.

Chris O'Grady finished with aplomb to reduce the deficit for Brighton in their Cup tie against Arsenal

Chris O'Grady - 6.5

Instinctive finish from the former Barnsley man got the hosts back into the game.  

SUBS: Solly March (on for Bruno, 63) - 6.5

Got stuck right into the thick of the action when he came on. Talented young player.

Adrian Colunga (on for Forster-Caskey, 82)

SUBS NOT USED: Hughes,  Mackail-Smith, Chicksen, Rea, Walton.

MANAGER

Chris Hughton - 6.5

Credit must go to the way Brighton got themselves back into the game after the break. But a poor first-half performance ultimately cost them dearly on the day.

ARSENAL (4-1-4-1) 

Wojciech Szczesny - 6

Had little to do throughout the afternoon, bar the two goals which he was unable to prevent.

Calum Chambers - 6

Provided an excellent assist for Walcott's goal, but could have been stronger  in the build-up when O'Grady netted for the hosts.

Laurent Koscielny - 5.5

Could have done better to prevent O'Grady from scoring and looked uneasy in defence at times.

Nacho Monreal - 6

The makeshift centre back put in a good shift for his side. 

Kieran Gibbs - 7.5

Yet again the left back impressed, attacking with intent and dealing with anything that came before him on the left-hand side. 

Mathieu Flamini - 6

Done nothing of real note, but at the same time didn't let his team down.

Theo Walcott - 7.5

His classy finish after just 89 seconds gave the Gunners an all-important early lead. A threat throughout. 

Aaron Ramsey - 7

Always looked to get on the ball and attack with intent. 

Tomas Rosicky - 8.5

Sublime assist for Arsenal's second goal, carving apart the Brighton defence with ease, before firing in a superb volley on the outside of his right foot to put the game out of the hosts reach. 

Tomas Rosicky was in impressive form for the Gunners as they secured a narrow win at Brighton

Mesut Ozil's classy finish doubled the Gunners' lead after 24 minutes

Mesut Ozil - 7.5

On his first start in nearly four months the German showed his class with a brilliant left-footed finish to double Arsene Wenger's side's lead before half-time.

Olivier Giroud - 7

Another decent display from Arsenal's lone front man, including setting up the third goal.

SUBS: 

Chuba Akpom (on for Giroud, 70) - 6

The youngster was unlucky not to score late on as he was denied by Stockdale.

Alexis Sanchez (on for Walcott, 70) - 6

Held up the ball well and showed some neat footwork too. Went close in the closing stages as his free-kick rattled the crossbar.

Francis Coquelin (on for Ozil, 80) - 6

SUBS NOT USED: Mertesacker, Cazorla, Martinez,  Bellerin.

MANAGER
