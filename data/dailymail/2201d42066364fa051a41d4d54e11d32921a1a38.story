A fierce tornado swept through New Zealand's largest city today killing three people and forcing 250 more to evacuate damaged and powerless homes.

The storm hit Hobsonville and Whenuapai, western suburbs of Auckland, at around midday leaving uprooted trees, damaged buildings and flooding that closed roads.

Three people died and further seven were admitted to hospital suffering a range of injuries in the deadliest tornado to hit New Zealand in more than 60 years.

Although the country averages around seven tornados each year, most are small, mild and do little damage.

New Zealand's temperate climate means it is not prone to the large, destructive tornados that plague places like the American Midwest.

Auckland Council spokesman Glyn Walters said the storm had made about 150 homes uninhabitable.

Some had roofs torn off or were severely damaged while others had more minor damage or had lost power.

Around 250 residents were taken to an air force base at Whenuapai, where council staff and welfare workers were helping them.

The worst weather appeared to have passed by mid-afternoon. Mr Walters said. 'It's clearing up slightly but people need to be careful out there.'

Auckland Fire Service area commander Larry Cocker confirmed three people had died in the storm.

Mr Walters said one person was killed when hit by a tree and that some others who were killed or injured were workers building a school.

Two of those who died were in an accident involving a slab of concrete.

Meteorologist Richard Turner said New Zealand is not prone to the intense surface heating that helps create the huge and violent tornados seen in the central United States.

But he warned even relatively small tornados like today's can cause damage and death.

Tornados in New Zealand are typically about 100ft wide and last for only a few minutes.

Daniel Corbett, a meteorologist with government forecaster MetService, said there had been some very warm, humid air 'like soup' sitting over Auckland for several days before thunderstorms hit, creating the conditions for today's tornado.

He said he expected the weather system would move away from the country tonight.

The tornado equalled the deadliest recorded in New Zealand's history.

In 1948, three people were killed when a tornado hit a suburb in the city of Hamilton.
