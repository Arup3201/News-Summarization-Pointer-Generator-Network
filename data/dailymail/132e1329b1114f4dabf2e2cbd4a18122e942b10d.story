'I want to go home': Dame Helen Mirren still fantasises about 'walking on the wild side', but is simply 'too tired' to become a rebel again

She has famously portrayed the Queen twice, on screen and on the stage, to great acclaim.

But there is one role that Dame Helen Mirren won’t be reprising, no matter how much she would love to – that of rebellious wild child.

The 67-year-old star has revealed that she still fantasises about ‘walking on the wild side’, but is simply ‘too tired’ to become a rebel again.

She said: ‘I was always rather attracted by a walk on the wild side when I was younger: I think that I’d love to still walk on the wild side, but I’m just too tired. I want to go home, I want to be in bed by 10.30pm.

‘But I guess to a certain extent I’m still sort of attracted by it.’

In 2008 she hinted at her rebellious past after revealing that she used to take cocaine when she was a rising star.

She claims she stopped taking it in the early 1980s after realising that a fugitive Nazi war criminal had lived off the proceeds of the drug.

And she recently admitted she was ‘very, very drunk’ when she got a tattoo on her hand as a young woman, adding that she got the body art because she wanted to cause controversy.

Dame Helen courted notoriety in her early career with a string of nude roles in movies such as Caligula and The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover.

She disrobed again in the 2002 movie Calendar Girls and two years ago she posed topless for a magazine to publicise her role as a brothel madam in the film Love Ranch.

In an accompanying interview for New York magazine, she declared: ‘I’m still the good girl who wants to be a bad girl.’

Despite her apparent rebellious streak she has been afforded national treasure status, thanks to her roles as DCI Jane Tennison in Prime Suspect and Elizabeth II in 2006 film The Queen.

Her talents have seen her win  one Oscar, four Baftas, three Golden Globes, four Emmy Awards and two Cannes Film Festival best actress awards.

In the recent interview with Reader’s Digest, Dame Helen also revealed she hates gratuitous violence in films, even admitting that she has pleaded with her directors not to  film her characters killing victims on screen.

Dame Helen, who plays an assassin in her upcoming film RED 2, said: ‘I have this big sequence where I walk into an embassy and start shooting.

'I kept saying to the director, “I will not shoot to kill. I want it to be very clear that I’m not killing people. Please, make it very clear”.

‘I do get terribly upset when I see films where people are just randomly shot. I think they all have families to go to, children at home, you know.’

The full interview with Dame Helen appears in the July issue of Reader’s Digest, in shops from June 25.
