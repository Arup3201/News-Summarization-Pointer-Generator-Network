Nicole Scherzinger is no stranger to stunning on the red carpet and her appearance at last week's National Television Awards was no different.

The sultry pop star looked sensational in a vintage plunging black Ossie Clark gown, a collector's item of the sort that changes hands for thousands of pounds.

And now FEMAIL is offering one lucky reader the opportunity to own a unique, never-to-be-repeated reproduction of the iconic original Ossie Clark for Quorum dress.

Lovingly recreated specially for FEMAIL by Nicolas Georgiou, designer of the relaunched and remastered Ossie Clark London label, the beautiful garment epitomises the controversial and quintessentially British style of the legendary couturier to the stars of the 60s and 70s.

The lucky winner will be in the very best of company with icons such as Mick Jagger, Liza Minelli, Twiggy and Marianne Faithfull among many others being some of those whose hearts were captured by the glamour and panache of the fashion designer.

Ossie Clark was the undisputed King of King's Road in his 60s and 70s heyday and his daring prints and fluid cuts quickly became synonymous 
with the fashion of the time.

Since
then, his clothes, which have become highly sought-after vintage pieces
that change hands for thousands of pounds, have been worn by the likes 
of Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell, who own carefully preserved original 
pieces themselves.

And in January, the legacy of the iconic designer, who died in 1996, was revived with the launch of a new Ossie Clark collection online and at
Debenhams under the watchful eye of Nicolas Georgiou.

Modern day fans of the label also include Emma Watson and Lily Allen as well, of course, as Nicole who teamed her stunning ensemble with a long Chanel Roman coin pendant, and opted for a pair of strappy black sandals to complete her look.
