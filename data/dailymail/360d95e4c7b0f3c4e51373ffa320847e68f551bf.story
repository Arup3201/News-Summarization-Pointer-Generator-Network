Wall Street banks have issued directives to ease up the workload and overbearing schedules of summer interns for fear that they are losing the best and the brightest to jobs in Silicon Valley.

Many former interns said that their average workdays lasted for 13 to 14 hours, and it was not unusual to stay in the office until the early hours of the morning at least one or two days per week.

In the Hong Kong office of Barclays their schedules were so demanding that many began taking naps in the toilets in order to sustain themselves.

Daunting: Barclays had no comment about the specific allegations of 'toilet naps' in their Hong Kong office (pictured)

The so-called 'toilet naps' were reported to The Wall Street Journal with
 multiple former interns telling the paper how they would go into the 
toilet stalls, plug their headphones into their cell phones and set an 
alarm to wake them up a short while later.

Barclays wouldn't comment on those specific allegations, which stem from members of the 2011 summer intern class, but did say that they- like many top banks- are looking for ways to improve their employees' quality of life while on the job.

'We are constantly evaluating our analyst program to ensure that it is a challenging and rewarding yet balanced experience,' a spokeswoman told The Wall Street Journal.

The self-reflection process started in earnest this fall after the summer death of 21-year-old Bank of America-Merrill Lynch intern Moritz Erhardt died from an epileptic fit following three-straight 'all nighters'. 

In turn, that bank launched a review 
of their practices and has since decided that summer interns should be 
granted at least four weekend days per month.

JP
 Morgan Chase is trying out a pilot program that grants younger bankers 
one 'protected weekend' per month where they will not be called into the
 office- let alone expected to respond to incessent calls and emails 
during that time.

Goldman 
Sachs started the search this fall and the first suggestion that came 
out of a task force to address the issue was the decision to lessen the 
amount of weekend work across the board that they demanded of interns.

Exhausted:
 Moritz Erhardt was a week from completing a coveted placement at Bank 
of America Merrill Lynch’s London offices when he was found dead in the 
shower at his temporary accomodation

Morgan Stanley has formed a similar committee to look into the issue of how they can improve the 'quality of life' factor for their junior staffers.

The Wall Street Journal reports that Morgan Stanley has not announced any blanket statements about weekends off, as the bank's chief executive James Gorman is against the idea.

Mr Gorman reportedly said that by implementing such requirements could stop younger bankers from having the chance to work on high-profile assignments
