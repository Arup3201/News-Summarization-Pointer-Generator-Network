After learning his fight with Dereck Chisora had been postponed, Tyson Fury decided to call out another opponent.

He had in mind an undefeated American heavyweight by the name of Deontay Wilder, known as the Bronze Bomber.

But when he took to Twitter, Fury instead targeted Lucy Bronze, an England and Liverpool footballer.

He tweeted: ‘Told you all that would happen. Find me a real man to fight the furious 1. @LucyBronze I want you punk.’

Realising his mistake, he added: ‘Ok I pressed the wrong person’ before offering anyone and everyone a fight.

He added: ‘If any1 feels like a fight I’m in Bolton town centre and I feel like a rumble.’

Bronze later tweeted: ‘Hahaha the tweets I’m getting because of this... sorry to let everyone down, but I’m unavailable for a fight.’

Fury’s rematch with Chisora was cancelled after the Londoner fractured his left hand in sparring.

It was scheduled to take place in Manchester on Saturday but is now expected to be held later in the year.

The winner will be in line for a shot at heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko.
