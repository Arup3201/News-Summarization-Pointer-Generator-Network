Samantha Cameron was last night dragged into a Coalition spat over the use of Downing Street after it emerged she hosted a Conservative campaign event at No 10.

Tory candidates standing in Liberal Democrat seats across the country were invited to bring constituents to the drinks reception with the Prime Minister’s wife.

Lib Dem MPs last night accused David Cameron of misusing the official residence by organising party political events in the taxpayer-funded property less than four months before the election.

Mrs Cameron hosted the first of a series of parties earlier this month where she posed for pictures with Tory candidates and high-profile community figures from their constituencies who had been invited by the election hopefuls.

The prospective MPs were then given the photos to help raise their profiles in their local newspapers, along with almost identical quotes from Mrs Cameron about how pleased she was to welcome them to No 10.

Jeremy Browne, Lib Dem MP for Taunton Deane, in Somerset, said he was concerned ‘about propriety and abuse of office’ and described the reception as a ‘bit sleazy’.

The Conservative candidate for the seat, Rebecca Pow, took two constituents to the event with Mrs Cameron on January 13, before taking two further guests from her community to a second No 10 drinks reception the following week.

Mr Browne, who is standing down at the election, said: ‘It is a scandal. It is the official residence of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Downing Street is not the property of the Conservative Party.’

Another Lib Dem, Chippenham MP Duncan Hames, said the events were ‘a desperate attempt by Conservative Central Office to artificially create some standing for their candidates’.

As well as the candidate for Taunton Deane, the prospective Tory MPs for North Devon, Somerton and Frome, Bath, Kingston and Surbiton, Torbay, and Cheltenham attended the reception with two guests with Mrs Cameron on January 13.

And on Monday, the Prime Minister hosted a similar event with guests including the candidates for Taunton Deane and Chippenham.

The ministerial code states that government property cannot be used for party fundraising. However, official residences can be used, as long as no public money is involved.

A Tory spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister hosts events for community and charity champions as part of his and the Conservative Party’s recognition of the incredibly valuable work that they do. 

'These events are paid for by the Conservative Party, not the taxpayer.’
