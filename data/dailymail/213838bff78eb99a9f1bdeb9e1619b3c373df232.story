Republicans in Congress have been licking their chops for nine months at the prospect of grilling embattled former IRS official Lois Lerner a second time, but her lawyer says they still can't have their chance.

Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has called Lerner back for a second hearing on March 5 about a program that saw the IRS targeting tea party organizations and other right-leaning groups with intrusive questions and years-long delays when they applied for nonprofit tax-exempt status beginning in 2009.

But in a letter to Issa, her attorney says she shouldn't have to appear because she has received death threats. If she does show up, he adds, she still won't answer questions unless she has immunity from prosecution or an order from a federal judge.

Lerner appeared in a committee hearing in May 2013 but refused to answer questions, invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

But because she offered an opening statement in which she insisted 'I have not done anything wrong,' committee members ruled that she had waived that privilege.

Tea party groups have been up in arms for nine months, demanding action from the IRS after they were targeted for special scrutiny because of their political beliefs

In a letter to Lerner’s lawyer on Tuesday, Issa set March 5 as the date she will have to answer probing questions about her role in the scandal – and possibly finger higher-ups who directed her to play political favorites and hamstring conservative applicants.

But her lawyer, William W. Taylor III, replied hours later with a letter saying he had warned committee staffers that 'calling Ms. Lerner [as a witness] knowing that she will assert her rights was not only improper but dangerous.'

'Ms. Lerner has been the subject of numerous threats on her life and safety, and on the life and safety of her family,' he wrote. 'I left with the staff recent evidence of those threats.'

He added that her tune might change if she was promised she couldn't face criminal charges.

'If granted immunity, she has no choice but to testify … the essence of an order conferring immunity is that it commands her to testify,' Taylor told The Washington Times.

Lerner, who retired in September with full benefits after a brief period of administration leave, is 'is uniquely positioned to provide testimony that will help the committee better understand how and why the IRS targeted these groups,' Issa wrote.

'The subpoena you accepted on Ms. Lerner’s behalf remains in effect,' he told Taylor.

'In light of this fact, and because the committee explicitly rejected her Fifth Amendment privilege claim, I expect her to provide answers when the hearing reconvenes.'

The House Committee on Oversight and Government Affairs has ruled that Lerner can't plead the Fifth Amendment like she did nine months ago, finding that she waived that privilege by giving a defensive opening statement

More than two dozen tea party groups have responded to what they say is unfair treatment by suing the federal government

Taylor didn't respond to a message seeking comment.

The
 IRS's practices became national news when Lerner casually dropped 
information about targeting conservative groups into a 
question-and-answer session during a Washington, D.C. meeting of tax 
administrators in early May.

Days
 later, an internal audit of the agency was released, showing that some 
tea party organizations' tax-exempt applications were held up for as 
long as 30 months. Documents released by Issa's committee showed that 
officials in Washington had a hand in taking over some cases from a 
satellite office in Cincinnati, Ohio.

More recently, an email surfaced showing that Lerner was among several officials who discussed a program in 2011 aimed at reviewing conservative groups' applications more closely in an 'off plan' strategy meant to be kept out of public view.

House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa may have larger ambitions: He told New Hampshire activists on Feb. 17 to unite against Obama's 'imperial presidency'

The Obama administration has taken 
heat from conservatives who insist that the White House had a role in 
the plan, which matured at the height of the 2010 election season when 
tea party activists were at their most vocal and effective.

Democrats
 in Congress have responded that there is no evidence anyone meant to 
step on conservatives' right to freely exercise political speech.

Now the IRS has moved to codify the ad hoc rules that put right-wing groups in limbo, proposing a raft of new regulations to govern the future evaluation of applications for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status.

Its stated intention is to rein in overtly political activity by those applicants – including voter registration drives, candidate forums and other election-focused programs. Federal law prohibits groups receiving tax exemptions from electioneering.

But Republicans say the IRS is playing favorites and stifling free speech, and they point to nearly 70,000 public comments submitted to the Treasury Department in opposition to the plan.

A proposal in the House, expected to pass along party lines, would force a year-long moratorium before the IRS could formalize its proposed rules. But the measure faces almost certain defeat in the Democrat-controlled Senate.

More than two dozen tea party groups have sued the federal government since last summer, with the American Center for Law and Justice representing most of them.

'The decision to recall Lois Lerner to testify before this House panel is not only appropriate but necessary to get to the bottom of this unlawful targeting scheme,' the group's lead counsel, Jay Sekulow, said Wednesday.

'The committee correctly concluded that Lerner waived her constitutional rights to refuse to answer questions before the panel. We know that she is deeply involved in this targeting scheme – even involved in planning new rules to restrict free speech ... It’s time for Lerner to stop the stonewalling – to present the facts and to tell the truth.'
