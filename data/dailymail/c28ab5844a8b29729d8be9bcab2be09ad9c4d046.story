The year six pupil was born a boy physically but has suffered from gender dysphoria, a disorder that makes a person unhappy with the gender they were born with.

His mother is supporting his decision. She has allowed him to dress as a girl and says he will start hormone blocker therapy – the first step to changing gender – when he is 12.

Close: The mother with her son, who has gender dysphoria

The boy, who wishes to remain 
anonymous, wanted to be a girl from the age of two-and-a-half and would 
play with Barbie dolls rather than Action Man.

The headteacher at his primary school
in Worcester gave a special assembly – attended by his parents and a 
police officer – to explain the change to other children and prevent 
bullying.

But the boy’s mother said other 
pupils have been more understanding than adults since he ‘came out’ as a
girl over the summer holidays.

The 36-year-old said neighbours and parents had branded her son a ‘freak child’ and reduced him to tears by heckling him.

She said of her son: ‘She is within 
her mind a girl but she has a boy’s body. She is the same as everybody 
else apart from the fact she doesn’t feel right in her own body.

‘She would rather play with a doll 
than a car. She is a girlie girl. She wants all the latest fashions. 
There is nothing about her which is male.

‘It wasn’t a problem until she got to
primary school at the age of seven-and-a-half. Then she would have to 
lie about what she got for Christmas and say a football or an Action Man
when in fact she got a pair of sparkly shoes and a Barbie. Everything 
she was having to do was a lie.’

People with gender dysphoria, which is also known as gender identity disorder and transgenderism, experience anxiety and discomfort about the gender they were born with.

It is rare, but the number of those  diagnosed is increasing due to growing public awareness.

Symptoms can begin at a very young  age. Children may refuse to wear the clothes typically worn by those of their gender, or may dislike taking part in the usual games and activities.

While the cause of gender dysphoria is unknown, it is classed as a psychiatric  condition.

Research into its causes is  ongoing, with recent studies suggesting it has much to do with biological development.

Treatment is varied and aims to help people become content with their gender identity.

Some choose to dress and live as their preferred gender, while others take hormones that change their physical appearance.

Most transsexuals – those who have  long-lasting and extreme gender dysphoria – seek to have surgery to permanently alter their sex.

In 2009, a German teenager became the youngest person to undergo Gender Reassignment Surgery for the condition – at the age of 16.

Kim Petras – born Tim - started hormone replacement therapy as part of her gender transition at age 12.

She added that her son had known he wanted to be a girl since he was two-and-a-half but was forced to act like a boy at school.

He would then act and dress like a 
girl when he got home but became a target for abuse as more and more 
people realised his secret.

His mother added: ‘We went to a 
performance at the school and my daughter (the boy) went as herself. 
Some of the parents were unhappy she was allowed to go into the school.

'They were walking past, coughing and
saying: “That’s that freak family. That’s that freak child”. It’s not a
phase. It’s not a choice – what child would choose to be completely 
miserable?

‘I don’t expect people to understand.
I just don’t want people abusing my child. I don’t want her to be 
called a freak. I want her to be left alone. Some people need glasses. 
Some people are required to go in wheelchairs. My daughter needs to 
dress like a girl because she is a girl.’

The mother added that the school had been very understanding, as had many of her son’s classmates.

But some parents said they should have been consulted before an announcement was made to the pupils on their first day back.

One parent with a child at the school
said: ‘The headteacher told all the kids that there was a kid at the 
school who was a girl trapped in a boy’s body.

The parents we spoke to are 
absolutely outraged that they weren’t consulted about this. This kid is 
just going to be bullied now. Why didn’t the school send us a letter?’

The school head said: ‘We operate an inclusive policy and work hard to ensure all our pupils have the support they need.

‘As part of this, we feel it is 
important to encourage discussion and promote understanding. We strive 
to make sure that all our children get the most possible out of their 
time here and a key part of this is helping pupils understand that all 
their peers are unique.’

According to the NHS, an estimated 
one in 4,000 people is receiving medical help for gender dysphoria. On 
average, men are five times more likely to be diagnosed with the 
condition than women.
