Defying the ban: South Carolina's State Education Superintendent Molly Spearman has lifted a complete ban on selling unhealthy snacks in schools

South Carolina schools have partially lifted a ban on junk food in defiance of rules championed by first lady Michelle Obama.

State Education Superintendent Molly Spearman has lifted a complete ban on selling unhealthy snacks in schools.

Some sales can take place for certain, approved fundraisers, multiple media outlets reported Sunday. 

The prohibition started last July under the Smart Snacks provision of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010.

Districts protested the ban, saying it hampered the ability of volunteer groups to raise money for activities like field trips.

Schools must apply for a waiver to allow snacks that don't meet low-sodium, low-sugar, low-fat limits to be sold in schools on certain days.

'I am pleased to issue guidance today allowing schools to hold a limited number of fundraisers exempt from the federal smart snacks rules,' Spearman wrote in a memo obtained by the Spartanburg Herald Journal.

'The flexibility enables local decision-making, rather than forcing us to follow mandates from the federal government. Schools now have clear, common-sense guidelines in place that will benefit students and local communities.'

Spearman's plan will, in its first year, give schools around 90 days during which they may sell candy and other junk food for fundraisers.

The second year, they'll be allowed closer to 60 days. The third, they be allowed to sell the non-compliant food around 30 days.

South Carolina is among 19 states that grant exemptions to the  

This summer, Mrs. Obama said she would fight 'until the bitter end' to make sure kids have good nutrition in schools.

South Carolina's lifting of the ban--which the state says will allow 'fundraisers' that include junk food a certain number of schools days per year--comes as part of a backlash against the Michelle Obama-backed Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010

While many schools have implemented the new standards successfully, others have said it's not working for them. The schools pushing for changes say limits on sodium and requirements for more whole grains are particularly challenging, while some school officials say kids are throwing away fruits and vegetables they are required to take.

The changes have been pushed by the School Nutrition Association, a group that counts both school nutrition directors and the food companies that produce many of the school foods among its members. The group said this week that a survey it conducted of more than 1,100 school lunch operators showed that more than half predict program expenses will exceed revenue this year.

Advocates for the healthier meal standards say the changes will take time. They predict there will be fewer problems as kids get used to the new foods and the food industry creates more tasty products that follow the standards, like whole grain pastas and tortillas that are now required to be served.

As schools have complained, USDA has shown some flexibility in tweaking the standards. In 2012, just a few months after the first rules went into effect, the department scrapped maximums on proteins and grains after students complained they were hungry. And USDA said earlier this year that schools can put off for two years a requirement that all pastas in schools be whole-grain rich, or more than half whole grain, if they can demonstrate that they have had 'significant challenges' in preparing the pasta.

Despite a barrage of criticism--and a growing trend in which students post their 'gross' lunches with the hashtag #thanksmichelleobama, Mrs. Obama this summer said she would fight 'until the bitter end' to make sure kids have good nutrition in schools
