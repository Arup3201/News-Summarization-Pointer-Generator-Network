A missing dog whose owner hired a £750 helicopter to look for her has been found drowned a few miles from where she disappeared.

Sylvia, a Japanese Shiba Inu, was discovered in the sea at Anglesey, north Wales, a week after going missing. 

Owner Janice Bannister had scoured the island for up to 12 hours a day since Sylvia went missing.

More than 40 volunteers turned up to help search Mrs Bannister, from Telford, Shropshire, for her beloved pet

People from all over the UK joined her on Saturday to look for Sylvia after her story attracted attention thanks to a Facebook campaign.

Mrs Bannister, of Telford, Shropshire, said she was devastated but wished to thank all those who had helped her.

A group set up on Facebook called Lost Dog Sylvia attracted more than 700 members all trying to help. 

And thanks to the generosity of locals, she had been staying in Anglesey during the search and was even offered a caravan to stay in whilst she looked for her dog.

Sylvia bolted while walking on sand dunes at Newborough Warren, Anglesey, last week

The dog was found drowned in the Menai Straits not far from Newborough where she went missing.

Locals feared the dog may have tried to swim off the island to get home after losing her owner.

Mrs Bannister cycled around the island in a desperate attempt to find her beloved pet - and even hired a private helicopter to scour the largest expanse of sand dunes in Europe.

She had also been leaving food at the Newborough beach car park in the hope Sylvia would come and eat but with no luck.
