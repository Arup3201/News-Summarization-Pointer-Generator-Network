The widow of one of the Boston bombers has remarried and has a baby with her new husband, one of her relatives has claimed in a report.

Katherine Russell, 25, was married to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the older of the two brothers suspected of detonating two bombs at the Boston Marathon last year. He was later killed in a shootout with police.

Now, little more than a year since his death, it has been claimed that she left her parents' home in Rhode Island and traveled 100 miles to New Jersey to be with Tsarnaev's  sisters, Bella and Aliana.

At the weekend, she was seen leaving the home with a baby in her arms - and Aliana, speaking to the New York Post, claimed that the child was Russell's.

'Yes, she got married [again] and had a baby,' Aliana Tsarnaeva told the Post.

MailOnline's calls to Russell's attorney have not been returned.

The women were found by the news station WCVB last week living in a nondescript blue house in the New Jersey township of 58,000 located about 10 miles west of Manhattan.

More than a year after suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed by police in the aftermath of the deadly attack, his widow moved in with his family in New Jersey. 

She was seen arriving home clad in a loose black frock, with a traditional Muslim headscarf tightly wrapped around her head and a pair of large sunglasses obscuring her face.

She refused to answer any questions about her late husband or brother-in-law, 20-year-old Dzhokhar, who is currently awaiting federal trial for his role in the April 15, 2013, bombing that killed three people and left 260 others wounded.

The two ethnic Chechen brothers from southern Russia were accused of planting two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs near the marathon finish line.

Tamerlan was killed in a getaway attempt after a gun battle with police.

Dzhokhar, who was captured hiding in a tarp-covered boat outside a house in a Boston suburb and is hospitalized, was later charged with using a weapon of mass destruction to kill.

Russell grew up Christian in the North Kingston, Rhode Island, home of a suburban doctor.

In 2010, the promising young artist and good student dropped out of college, converted to Islam and married Tamerlan Tsarnaev, whom she met at a nightclub. The couple had a daughter.

The young family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they settled in a cramped apartment and attended prayers in a Boston Islamic center.

A few weeks after the bombing, Russell’s attorney Amato DeLuca claimed his client learned that her husband was suspected of being a terrorist from news reports on TV.

DeLuca said Russell had no reason to suspect her husband of anything and was focused on supporting her family, working 70 to 80 hours, seven days a week as a home health care aide.

Katherine Russell has largely avoided the public eye since the bombing. Her attorney told WCVB that while Russell's parents and sisters testified before a grand jury, she was never called to speak.

The Tsarnaev sisters, have had legal problems of their own in recent years.

Ailina is expected to go on trial next month on charges of misleading police in a counterfeit money probe, while Bella stands accused of marijuana possession with intent to distribute.

Both women have visited their younger brother in jail. Dzhokhar is set to face trial in November.
