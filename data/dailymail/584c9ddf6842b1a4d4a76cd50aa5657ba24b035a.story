Royal baby news: Princess Madeleine is pregnant

Princess Madeleine of Sweden, fourth in line to the throne, is expecting her second child, the
royal court said on Friday.

The royal baby announcement has been made just ten months after Madeleine, 32, gave birth to daughter Leonore, with the new royal baby due in the summer of 2015.

'We are very happy and look forward to welcoming a new
member to our family,' Princess Madeleine and her  husband, British-American banker Christopher O'Neill, said in a statement.

Representatives of the Royal Court said the announcement has been made in order to avoid speculations, as the Princess will make an appearance at an event on Saturday.

Princess Madeleine and her husband are attending the Swedish Academy's holiday gathering in Stockholm with the rest of the Royal family tomorrow.

The Princess and Mr O'Neill became first-time parents just ten months ago, when Princess Leonore was born in New York's Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York, on February 20.  

Leonore, full name and title H.R.H. Princess Leonore Lilian Maria of Sweden, Duchess of Gotland is fifth in line to the throne, but only if she takes Swedish citizenship and is brought up as a member of the Church of Sweden. 

Mr O'Neill, 40, who was born in London, has maintained both his U.S. and British citizenships following his marriage to Princess Madeleine, as well as his catholic faith.

The new addition to the family is likely to be born in Sweden as the Princess has planned to spend a lot of time in her home country this summer, a representative said today.

Next summer is going to be busy for the Swedish Royal family as Prince Carl-Philip is set to marry former glamour model Sofia Hellqvist

Princess Madeleine lives with her husband in New York, where she works for the World Childhood Foundation, a non-profit group founded by her mother, Queen Silvia.

In the past few months, rumours have been flying that the family is considering a move to London in order to be closer to the Swedish royal family. 

Princess Madeleine's full title is H.R.H Madeleine
Therese Amelie Josephine, Princess of Sweden, Duchess of
Halsingland and Gastrikland.

Support for the monarchy remains relatively strong in
Sweden, with Crown Princess Victoria and her daughter Princess Estelle, three, particularly popular.  

Sweden
 is a constitutional monarchy in which the royals primarily serve as 
figureheads. The King is the country's head of state, but his powers are
 limited to ceremonial duties.

The new baby will arrive right around the time Madeline's brother Prince Carl Philip marries his glamour model fiancee, seen here last week at the Nobel Prize Banquet
