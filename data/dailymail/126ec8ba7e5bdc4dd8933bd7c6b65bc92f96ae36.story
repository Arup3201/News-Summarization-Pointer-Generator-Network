With bulletproof glass and surveillance cameras, the owner of this liquor store thought his business was well protected.

But no matter what security measures he had put in place, it wouldn't have prevented one of the strangest fires local crews in Burnsville, Minnesota,  have ever dealt with.

Red Lion Liquors was left with significant damage after a row of vodka bottles magnified the sunlight which led to a fire inside the shop.

The bizarre blaze occurred when the store was closed last Sunday and eventually resulted in 12-foot flames shooting into the air.

CCTV cameras capture the moment the fire began. Smoke could be seen emerging from the display of vodka bottles with cardboard then catching fire.

The heat became so intense that the tops of the vodka bottles popped off and streams of the strong alcohol spraying all over the store.

Usually, the only kind of sun the staff at Red Lion Liquors have to worry about is a type of Spanish beer, but one of hottest sellers on the floor got a little too toasty when the store was closed last Sunday

Manager Dave Hautman said: 'We have shades on the windows. We'll pull them down on sunny days to protect the wine on the shelves, never thinking it would ever start a fire

The flames were given an additional boost thanks to a ceiling fan.

Manager Dave Hautman said: 'We have shades on the windows. We'll pull them down on sunny days to protect the wine on the shelves, never thinking it would ever start a fire.

'It was just this freak thing.'

According to Mr Hautman, even firefighters at the scene were left completely shocked over how the fire started, with many saying they had never seen a blaze like it.

Following the fire, the store was closed for almost two weeks. It was left damaged by the intense smoke and also from water which was released from the sprinklers.

Since then, the windows have been tinted to prevent a similar incident in the future.

The store which has been in Burnsville since 1978 and has occupied the same building since 1978 reopened on Friday.
