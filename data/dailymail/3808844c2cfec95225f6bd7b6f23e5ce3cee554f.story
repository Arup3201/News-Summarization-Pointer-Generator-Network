He's called Kale Chips.

But you wouldn't guess it.

While most of his breed is healthy at 22-25 pounds, this seven-year-old Beagle weighs a hefty 85.

And when he was surrendered to animal rescue volunteers by his elderly Chicago owner, they needed a wagon to wheel him into the shelter.

Tipping the scales: Kale Chips weighs 85 pounds - quadruple the healthy weight of average adult Beagles

'It was a huge shock, he is the most overweight dog we have ever encountered,' Heather Owen, co-founder of One Tail, told DailyMail.com

'The shelter has a wagon on hand for dogs that can't walk,' she added. 

'They used it to wheel him from his kennel to us, so we could take him out of the shelter. He had to be lifted out and helped to the car.' 

It was a shock - despite the fact that Beagles, according to the National Beagle Club, 'are one of a very few breeds that will literally eat themselves to death.'

Julie Wright of the NBC explains that 'most dogs will self-regulate and only eat the amount of food they need to maintain the level of exercise they are getting. 

'However, beagles have a tendency to eat all the food they can get and use those soft brown eyes to beg for more and more.'

But few have been known to gorge to such extremes. 

'His owner relinquished him to the shelter because they were elderly and unable to care for him,' Owen told us.

'We don't know much beyond that, but we think it was a situation in which they were unable to walk him, and as time went on it got worse and worse.' 

Hoping to tempt fate with a diet-friendly name, the volunteers came up with Kale Chips.

Special measures: His joints are so weak he had to be wheeled into the rescue center on a wagon

He will now be placed on an intensive program to slim down.

While exercise will be important, the volunteers will ease him into movement as he is so out of shape and his joints are weak. 

And on the menu, it won't be much more than kale chips. 

'We called him Kale Chips to signify his new healthy life. We wanted to give him a fresh start with a new name. 

'I'm sure he would have liked to be just Chips,' Owen said.

The dog will remain at One Tail at a Time until he is adopted.

'We are currently waiting for blood test results to see if he has any underlying medical issues. 

'If he does, we'll take care of those first. If not, we teamed up with The Honest Kitchen who will be providing him with high quality, high protein, low calorie dog food. 

'We are also working with Integrative Pet Care and will be starting him on a slow weight loss program which will include hydrotherapy (underwater treadmill). It's going to be a slow, steady process.'
