Ask Ian Poulter about the fact virtually everyone thinks him a racing certainty for a wild card for the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles next month, and he smiles knowingly.

‘That would be a lovely little story for you if I start agreeing with all that, wouldn’t it?’ he said. ‘You’re not having that. What can I say? It’s hardly for me to say I should be getting a wildcard.’

Every two years the tasty sub-plot at the USPGA Championship is the pivotal role it plays in deciding the last spots for the two Ryder Cup teams, and this year’s promises to be a belter.

We'll cross that bridge when we come to it: Justin Rose and Ian Poulter practised together at Valhalla

Basically, as far as Europe are concerned, there are seven players whom you could throw a blanket over chasing two spots plus three wildcards, with an eighth, Lee Westwood, somewhat adrift but a definite contender for the latter.

As things stand, Graeme McDowell’s top 10 at the Bridgestone Invitational last week has taken him into eighth place, with Jamie Donaldson now clinging to the last automatic spot over Luke Donald by the skin of his teeth.

The men who can breathe easily are Rory McIlroy, Sergio Garcia, Henrik Stenson, Victor Dubuisson, Thomas Bjorn, Justin Rose and Martin Kaymer. Just behind Donald and the Scot Stephen Gallacher in 12th spot, and just ahead of Miguel Angel Jimenez and Francesco Molinari, comes Poulter.

Adding to the fascination for him is the season’s final major taking place at Valhalla, where his Ryder Cup reputation took off in 2008 despite the fact he finished on the losing side.

It all came flooding back as he made his way off the tee at the par-three 14th. ‘I can certainly remember what happened here on the Sunday because it was the most disappointed I have ever felt on a golf course,’ he said. ‘I was winning my match comfortably but the news had just filtered through that we had lost. It’s hard to describe what that is like other than to say you just feel horribly empty. So I played well. What did that matter?

‘You’re judged on how you perform as a team and you can hardly feel personally satisfied in those circumstances.’

It is a fact Europe have won both matches since while Poulter has not dropped so much as a single half-point in his last seven games. It is the reason why ‘the Poults Clause,’ as Lee Westwood wittily described how a place had to be found for Poulter following his miracles at Medinah, will be activated if necessary, despite the fact the man in question has not had a top 10 all summer.

Will a return to Valhalla bring about a welcome change of fortune? ‘It will probably look silly from the outside given my results but I am feeling good about my game,’ he said.

‘I did play well here in 2008 and I need to make plenty of birdies as I did then. As for the Ryder Cup, I’m fully aware I am not in the team but close enough that one good week can do it for me. So let’s get out there and concentrate on playing well.’

Alongside him, just as he was during that Ryder Cup six years ago, was his old mucker Justin Rose. ‘Never a dull moment with Poults, is there?’ said Rose, laughing.

Like most people, the Englishman thinks Poulter, McDowell and Donald will get in either automatically or through a wildcard, leaving two spots to fill. Rose thinks Westwood a slight favourite for one via a wildcard but Donaldson and Gallacher look in the box seats to me.

This week, however, could change all that. ‘You wouldn’t be surprised if something dramatic happened, would you?’ said Rose.

Then there is the American team, with 11 places all but sorted: Bubba Watson, Jim Furyk, Jimmy Walker, Rickie Fowler, Matt Kuchar, Jordan Spieth, Patrick Reed, Jason Dufner, Zach Johnson, Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley.

Who gets the last one? Surely not Tiger Woods, from whom there was still no word, at the time of writing, as to whether he will make the starting line-up.

What will Rory do next? Will Rose, Adam Scott, Stenson or Garcia knock him off his No 1 perch with a win?

As if the battle for the season’s final major was not enough, there is an obvious chance for others to have the final word regarding a Ryder Cup place.

It should be some week. Just the way Poulter likes it.
