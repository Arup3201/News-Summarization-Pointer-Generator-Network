Robin Roberts is supposed to be in 'paradise,' taking a little time off from her Good Morning America duties for some rest and relaxation.

But the 52-year-old anchor, who is on vacation in Maui, Hawaii, looks far from relaxed.

Photographed with her family and friends on the golf course of her ocean-side resort, the morning television anchor seemed worried and pensive yesterday.

But despite her worried expressions, Ms Roberts appears to be 'feeling the Aloha spirit,' as she tweeted last week.

And this weekend, she added: 'Just another day in Maui paradise. A blessed Sunday to all. XO'

The television host, who had a bone marrow transplant last September as treatment for myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), has been busy relaxing on the beach, playing tennis and dining along the beautiful waterfront.

After receiving a bone marrow transplant
from her older sister and enduring several rounds of intense 
chemotherapy, Ms Roberts went into recovery and recorded the entire process 
for her viewers.

Ms Roberts, who triumphantly returned to work in 
February and has a memoir that is set to be released in 2014, left New York for her rest and recuperation trip on August 11.

The journalist accepted a Peabody Award 
for her ABC documentary Robin's Journey that followed her battle with 
the rare blood disease.

Held
at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City in May, Robin took to the 
stage to accept her prestigious honour at the 72nd Annual Peabody 
Awards.

During her acceptance speech, which received a standing ovation, she noted that the date marked a very special anniversary.

'[It] is eight months to the day since my transplant. So technically, I'm eight months old today.'

In the award-winning documentary, Ms Roberts shared the intimate stages of her bone marrow transplant, from pre-treatment to her 'all clear' moment.

Her sister, Sally-Ann Roberts, was the journalist's blood marrow donor, and also attended the awards ceremony.

Opening up to The Hollywood Reporter, Robin said that it was 'very weird' for her to go from journalist to subject as Good Morning America chronicled her treatment and recovery.
