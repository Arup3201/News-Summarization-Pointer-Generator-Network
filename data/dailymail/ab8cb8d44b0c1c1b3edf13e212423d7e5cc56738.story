England will have either home or away fixtures against four European giants - Germany, Spain, France and Italy - over the next two years to help drum up backing for a national team to be watched by its lowest crowd at the new Wembley against Norway next Wednesday.

FA general secretary Alex Horne called the expected crowd of between 35,000 and 40,000 ‘disappointing’ and added ‘there is some work to do’ re-engaging with disillusioned regulars.

One ambitious plan is to build a new fanbase by enrolling 500,000 football fans in the revamped England Supporters Club, despite current members being upset at the way they’re taken for granted.

An FA official confirmed the low figure at Wembley next week. They told MailOnline: 'So far the ticket sales are around the 37,000 mark, including Club Wembley members.

'It is hard to say whether we will surpass the total figure who were here at the Sweden game in 2011 (which was recorded at 48,876).

'However what we will do is to continue to push on with further marketing and media campaigns right up until the day promoting the game and hopefully we will beat this total.'
