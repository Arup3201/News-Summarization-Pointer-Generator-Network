Kerry Kennedy upset plenty of friends and acquaintances this holiday season after a simple email wishing everyone a Merry Christmas turned into a whole heap of spam for recipients including billionaire financier Steven Rattner, actress Catherine Keener and former Kennedy family political adviser Alan Fleischmann.

Kennedy’s eco-friendly, e-card featured a photo of her three daughters, together with a biblical quote and a simple Merry Christmas greeting.

Unfortunately for her - and everyone’s 
inbox - a technical glitch meant that even though everyone was bcc’d, 
anyone who responded by hitting 'Reply All' sent their message plus 
e-mail address to Kennedy’s entire distribution list.

Christmas cheer? Kerry Kennedy has three daughters from her marriage to New York State Gov Andrew Cuomo, twins Cara and Mariah, plus Michaela

Initial responses to the card were upbeat and full of seasonal cheer and some even bordered on sycophantic as they complimented Kerry, who is president of the Robert F. Kennedy Center, on her beautiful family. 

But tempers soon started to fray as people found themselves inundated with a load of spam emails from other on the list.

‘Please remove me from mass e-mails to Kerry in reply to her christmas card,’ demanded activist Valerie Sklarevsky, reports the New York Post. 

‘Please REMOVE ME FROM YOUR EMAIL 
LISTS!!!’ whined another responder, as more than and more people started
 to lose patience with the endless stream of replies.

By Friday, one e-mailer could take no more and announced that he was copying RFK Center COO John Zurick to ‘suspend the group e-mail that led to the inbox clutter'.

Then it all got too much for Rattner, who replied: ‘I think something more along the lines of an apology would be in order. Please be sure I never get an e-mail from this organization again.’

But still the heated debate didn’t end and so Fleischmann felt duty bound to chime in and defend the person responsible.

‘Kerry did nothing wrong... she never exposed anybody’s private e-mails or intended to... this did not irritate me to get a bunch of e-mails that say happy holidays to Kerry,’ he protested.

Next up Keener weighed in with, ‘Be more upset with the NSA than RFK.’

Finally, a mortified Kennedy braved the ire of her so-called friends by offering her ‘profuse apologies.’

‘You may be happy to know that my New Year’s resolution is to not bother all my friends during the holidays,’ she promised.
