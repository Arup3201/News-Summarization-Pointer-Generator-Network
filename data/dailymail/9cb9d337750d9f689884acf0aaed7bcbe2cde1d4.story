Emiliano Martinez is set to make his Champions League bow against Anderlecht on Wednesday as Arsenal face a goalkeeping crisis.

Wojciech Szczesny (suspended) and David Ospina (thigh) are both unavailable for the trip to Belgium.

And Martinez, 22, is in line to deputise in goal for the European clash.

Martinez (centre) let in five goals in his previous appearance - against Reading in the Capital One Cup

A product of Arsenal's youth system, Martinez had played just twice for the club - his last appearance came in the kamikaze 7-5 Capital One Cup win over Reading two years ago.

Martinez spent a period on loan at Sheffield Wednesday last year.

He played 15 times for the Owls but the Champions League tie in Anderlecht will be the biggest match he has been involved in since his arrival in England.

Emiliano Martinez? Doesn't sound born and bred north London? 

You're right, but he's been part of the Arsenal set-up for four years now so is no stranger to the capital. He arrived from Argentinian club Independiente in 2010, joining Arsenal's youth system.

He must be a talent for Arsenal to bring him all the way from South America?

By all accounts he is. He's very highly-rated among the academy staff at Arsenal, playing regularly for the Under 21s, and was expected to make a significant impact at first-team level. He is a former Argentina youth international to boot.

So it's not gone according to plan then?

Not quite. Despite his talent, he has found it tough to dislodge Wojciech Szczesny and Lukasz Fabianski (now at Swansea) in the Gunners squad since graduating from the academy. He may have thought he'd be promoted to second-choice keeper following Fabianski's exit, but David Ospina's signing means he remains as third choice.

So he's played twice for Arsenal. How did they go?

Not great, he's conceded six goals in those two previous appearances for the club, both coming in the League Cup. He helped Arsenal to a 6-1 win over Coventry in September 2012 before conceding five more in the 7-5 win over Reading a few weeks later. He hasn't played since. Still, 100 per cent win record, though.

That's not much first-team experience though, is it?

True. But he spent the back end of last season on loan at Sheffield Wednesday, where he made 15 appearances, in which he kept two clean sheets.
