Victim: Big Issue seller Razvan Dumitru stole £50 from blind pensioner Jane Phillips, pictured, as she tried to give him some money

A Romanian Big Issue seller who stole £50 from a blind pensioner lives in a four-bedroom terraced house worth £250,000.

Razvan Dumitru snatched five £10 notes from 66-year-old Jane Phillips’s purse as she tried to give him £1 so he could buy something to eat.

Nearby shoppers held the 22-year-old until police arrived.

Miss Phillips revealed that the same  man had stolen money from her before but that she had forgiven him and given him more money because she thought he was homeless.

But last night it emerged that Dumitru and his family live on a smart street in Edmonton, North London, where properties typically sell for more than a quarter of a million pounds.

In November 2011, their house was offered for rent at £1,600 a month and described by letting agents as ‘immaculate’, with ‘three double rooms, one en suite, two bathrooms, good-size garden, large reception and newly fitted kitchen’.

Big Issue sellers must be homeless, in temporary accommodation or facing financial crisis to be allowed to sell the magazine, but neighbours said Dumitru and his family had lived in the property for some two years.

A woman who identified herself as Dumitru’s mother laughed when asked about her son’s crime.

She would not confirm whether Dumitru lived with her but acknowledged he was awaiting  sentencing, saying: ‘It’s fine.’

And Dumitru’s father, who was reached by phone, reacted by  simply saying: ‘So?’

One shopkeeper on the quiet residential street said he had banned the family from his store.

The man, who did not want to be named, said lots of different people were seen arriving at the property at night in luxury cars.

The
 shopkeeper said it was unclear how many people lived in the house but 
they seemed to  have money because they drove BMW and Mercedes cars.

It
 will raise questions about why Dumitru was allowed to sell the Big 
Issue magazine – a job reserved  for Britain’s homeless – especially 
considering he had previous convictions.

Last night it was revealed that
 Dumitru stole from Miss Phillips while serving a suspended prison 
sentence.

In December 2011 
he pleaded guilty to stealing an iPhone in Caffé Nero in Clapham 
Junction, South London, and was given a six-month suspended sentence.

He
 had also been banned from the supermarket Morrisons in Sutton, South 
London, where last Saturday’s incident took place, for shoplifting.

Morrisons
 security guard Lisbona Addo said Dumitru was well known in the area as a
 shoplifter, adding: ‘I’ve arrested him once before. He’s not allowed in
 the store.’

Dumitru 
admitted the offence against Miss Phillips in front of Croydon 
magistrates on Monday and has been remanded in custody to be sentenced.

Miss
 Phillips said Dumitru should be deported, adding: ‘I don’t think 
criminals from another country should be able to stay here.’

A Big Issue spokesman said: ‘Dumitru had been selling, on and off, for a number of months. He was never a consistent presence.’

The
 charity said it took referrals from councils on the homelessness status
 of vendors but that this  system was ‘far from reliable’.

Last
 year it was revealed that an astonishing one in three Big Issue vendors
 – 700 out of a nationwide force of 2,250 – come from Romania.

Under a 
loophole in EU immigration rules, Big Issue sellers can claim 
‘self-employed status’ in the UK and therefore claim benefits.

The Big Issue added: ‘The Big Issue puts each new vendor through an induction process.

‘Each
 vendor at the end of induction signs a code of conduct they must adhere
 to when selling. If  they breach it, they will be disqualified from 
selling.’

Emil Metodiev was jailed yesterday for a burglary nine days after arriving in Britain from Bulgaria

Millions of Romanian and Bulgarian 
citizens will be able to live freely in Britain when restrictions are 
lifted on January 1.

The move has sparked fears of an influx in which many could fail to find work, ending up destitute or selling the Big Issue.

British
 politicians have clashed with those in Romania, including Minister for 
Labour Mariana Campeanu - who said her country's citizens take jobs 
shunned by British workers.

She
 added the UK should be 'grateful' for the extra labour and only a tiny 
minority of people will come to Britain in the hope of claiming benefits
 or committing crime.

However,
 politicians have raised concerns over how immigrants with shady pasts 
will be monitored, or how the authorities will prevent those with few 
means becoming homeless or sleeping rough.

Yesterday a Bulgarian citizen with a string of convictions in his homeland was jailed for breaking into a home just nine days after coming to the UK.

Emil Metodiev (right) was caught after being chased by a homeowner who found him stealing a handbag, cash, war medals, mobile phones and jewellery.

The 32-year-old, jailed for theft at least four times in Bulgaria, arrived on October 22 after leaving his wife and the clothes shop they ran in the capital city, Sofia.

Nine days later, Denise Toms, 55, woke up to find the downstairs of her home in Southend, Essex, had been ransacked.

Her son Adam, 19, saw Metodiev fleeing through the back garden and chased after him wearing  just his underpants.
