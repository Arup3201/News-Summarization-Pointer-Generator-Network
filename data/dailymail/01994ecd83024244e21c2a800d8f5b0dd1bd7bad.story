A man has been accused of breaking into the apartment of a woman he met in a bar and raping her at knifepoint while her terrified partner lay next to them in the bed. 

Tilfert Darrell Vaughn, 54, of Phoenix, Arizona was arrested on Sunday following the alleged incident.

Police say Vaughn broke into the couple's apartment and sexually assaulted the 27-year-old woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, while holding a large knife to her throat after spotting her earlier that evening in a bar. 

Phoenix police say the alleged incident took place on November 5 in the apartment the woman shared with her partner.

Court records show the woman's 30-year-old girlfriend woke up when Vaughn allegedly got in to the bed and was injured when her hand and fingers came into contact with Vaughn's knife.

She required 'extensive surgery' according to AZ Central. 

Both women told police that they feared Vaughn would kill them if they did not do as he said. 

Court papers show the victim told investigators that following the rape Vaughn told her: 'You now have a baby. Bless it and take care of it.'

The woman told police she woke up and saw the suspect standing naked inside her bathroom holding a knife.

She claims Vaughn then ordered her to lie on the bed and he proceeded to sexually assault her.

The alleged victim said he told her not to look at him as he went to the bathroom before he dressed and left.

Police say Vaughn's DNA matched physical evidence taken from the woman's forensic exam.  

Vaughn denies going to the victim's apartment and denies raping her.   

He is facing charges of rape, sexual assault, aggravated assault, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, kidnapping and burglary.

Investigators also believe that Vaughn took several items from the couple's apartment, including sunglasses, toiletries, beer and food, according to AZ Central.

Vaughn is set to attend a preliminary hearing next week.
