The chief spokesman of Walmart has resigned after the supermarket giant discovered he lied about his college degree.

David Tovar was forced out when the world's largest retailer found that the 40-year-old never graduated with an arts degree from the University of Delaware.

According to an investigation by Bloomberg News, Tovar failed to get his diploma in 1996 and never finished the course work he started at the school.

Resignation: David Tovar has left his position as chief spokesman for Walmart after the retail giant discovered he had lied about his college degree

He stepped down after eight years with Walmart and the former spokesman declined all requests to make a statement.

A spokesman for the retailer told Bloomberg that it was up to Tover to 'speak to anything about his background.'

According to the New York Post, Bloomberg discovered the lie while they were screening Tovar for another promotion.

The fabrication of his degree was uncovered through this 'due-diligence screening.'

Why Walmart only conducted a screening of Tovar now is unknown, however he joined Walmart with no problems in 2006 from tobacco giant Altria.

Tovar came to national prominence earlier this year when he became involved in a spat with the New York Times' own Walmart Blog about a 'wildly inaccurate' column by Timothy Egan regarding the minimum wage.

In March 2013, Tovar was arrested for failure to appear before an Arkansas county judge regarding a speeding ticket. The arrest had nothing to do with his dismissal this week

In a poorly received move, Tovar uploaded a version of Egan's column covered in red pen that showed inaccuracies, as if marked by a school teacher.

In an interview with CNBC, Tovar told the network that his resume omission was uncovered when he was being promoted to senior vice president.

'As part of that process I was going through additional leadership assessment, including a battery of tests including questions about leadership, drug tests, background checks,' he said to CNBC.

'In the background check my education was flagged—it was done by a third party company. They asked me about it, and I was 100 percent transparent.

'I got a job and never looked back. I really didn't think an art degree would matter in communications, which was the field I went into,' he said.

Tovar said that whatever happens, he is not leaving Walmart under a cloud.

'Walmart said they could not promote me based on what they found. I said that the more senior job is the one that I wanted, so we agreed I would leave,' he said.

'I am leaving on good terms and Walmart has been very supportive. I am still here a few more weeks.'
