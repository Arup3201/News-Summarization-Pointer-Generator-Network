Outraged patients who have been left permanently injured as a result of medical negligence have spoken out against the system that they claim failed them.

The World Health Organisation estimates nearly 50,000 Australians are left maimed or injured each year as a result of medical negligence, with Queensland Health spending $55 million in 2013 alone on settlements from these cases.

A Current Affair spoke to two victims whose lives have been altered dramatically through the actions of hospital staff and who now need constant care to perform even the simplest daily acts.

Cathy Smith visited her local hospital for elective surgery ahead of a proposed hysterectomy, and was deprived of oxygen for ten minutes on the operating table when the breathing tube that was intended for her trachea was inserted into her esophagus.

Mrs Smith was left with permanent brain damage, and suffers from a range of issues which have affected her vision, balance, and memory. 

'She was a mess,' said Mrs Smith's husband Ken, who now has to assist her with many of her basic tasks.

Unable to drive or even shower herself, Mrs Smith was left devastated.

'I think I look pretty normal but that’s the effect of a brain injury- there's no bandages,' she told A Current Affair.

'It's one thing to make a mistake, and another thing to do nothing to fix it. That's what made me really angry,' said Mr Smith. 

Wayne Rutch was also left permanently injured as a result of the negligence of medical staff

Mr Ruth went into hospital in February 2013 for routine bowel surgery and woke up in intensive care, unable to use his arms

Mr Rutch's arms had been left dangling off the table edge for the ten hours it took for his surgery to be completed, which stretched and broke the nerves in the back of his neck and shoulders

Wayne Rutch was also left permanently injured as a result of the negligence of medical staff, when he went into hospital in February 2013 for routine bowel surgery and woke up in intensive care, unable to use his arms.

'It's really scary, you just don't know what's happening,' Mr Rutch said.

'All these different things start going through your mind,' he said.

Mr Rutch's arms had been left dangling off the table edge for the ten hours it took for his surgery to be completed, which stretched and broke the nerves in the back of his neck and shoulders.

Carrying a 2L bottle of milk is now a task which he cannot complete, along with removing the tag tie on a loaf of bread.

'I've always got to have someone with me to do the simplest tasks. It still hurts to talk about all this,' he said. 

Ken Smith said that he and his wife were very reluctant to begin legal proceedings, but their hands were forced when they received no follow up care after his wife's injury

The Rutches are suing the Queensland Health system, a step which Melissa O'Neill from Shine Lawyers said is as a result of policies and procedures which were just not followed

His wife Rhonda has now taken on two jobs to support their family, and with large medical bills flooding in that they are unable to pay for the pair have undertaking legal proceedings against the system which they claim failed them.

The Rutches are suing the Queensland Health system, a step which Melissa O'Neill from Shine Lawyers said is as a result of policies and procedures which were just not followed.

Medical negligence lawyer Bill Maddern from Slater and Gordon said that 97% of medical negligence cases were resolved and never come to the attention of the public, despite there being over 4250 cases in 2013.

Ken Smith said that he and his wife were very reluctant to begin legal proceedings, but their hands were forced when they received no follow up care after his wife's injury. 

'Compensation can't ever give back health, but it does make a difference to people's lives,' Margaret Brain of Morris Blackburn lawyers said

'We got into the legal side of things kicking and screaming,' Mr Smith said.

'We didn't want to go there but when we went to see the first neurologist, he said that there was going to need to be ongoing treatment.'

Margaret Brain of Morris Blackburn lawyers said that Mrs Smith was never given appropriate follow-up care, and that her first appointment for rehab was five weeks after the incident occured.

'In cases like this you need to prove that there's been a breach of duty of care by the hospital or medical staff to meet an appropriate standard, and this is what has happened here,' said Ms Brain.

'Compensation can't ever give back health, but it does make a difference to people's lives,' she said.
