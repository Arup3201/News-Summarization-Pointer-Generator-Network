Manchester United star Paul Scholes had his Â£30,000 car stolen after he left the engine running while defrosting it on his driveway yesterday.

The 38-year-old former England midfielder had gone back inside his home while ice melted on the windscreen of his Chevrolet Captiva LT 2 Estate.

When he came back out of the house between 7.45am and 8am the car had gone.

Victim: Paul Scholes, pictured with his wife Claire and during his Manchester United playing days, had left the engine running when his Chevrolet Captiva LT 2 was stolen on Monday morning

Greater Manchester Police confirmed that they are now investigating the theft from Scholes' home in Oldham.

A spokesman for the force said: 'Police are investigating after a car was stolen while the owner was defrosting the vehicle.

'The grey Chevrolet Estate was stolen from the drive of a house in the Greenfield area of Oldham.

'Inquiries to locate the car are ongoing.'

The force also issued a warning to other motorists to beware opportunist thieves while defrosting their cars.

Chevrolet sponsor United and the Reds' squad were offered a choice of their vehicles as part of the multi-million pound deal.

But Reds manager Sir Alex Ferguson banned his young stars from owning the manufacturer's Corvette model, which can hit top speeds of 195mph.

It is not the first time that Scholes and his family have fallen victim to thieves.

Stolen: Scholes car is a Chevrolet Captiva 2.4 LT like the one pictured

In 2007 a gang of raiders armed with a knife stole a car belonging to his parents car after breaking into their home in Middleton, Greater Manchester.

After that incident, his dad Stewart said: 'My wife went down to confront them. She screamed at me and I ran down to see them waving knives.

'They were shouting what they were going to do if I didn't give them the keys, so I just said "there's the keys, leave us alone".'

Scholes was said at the time to be 'disgusted' by the raid.
