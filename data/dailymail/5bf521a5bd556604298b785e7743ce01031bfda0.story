A couple who began their relationship after 'meeting' on Facebook have discovered that they have known each other since primary school and had even visited each other's houses as children.  

Saidee Bailey and Beau Samuelson were two years apart at Westbrook Hay Prep School in Hemel Hempstead, Herts, where they sat for a group photo in 2001.

They barely knew each other and went on to separate secondary schools before starting their careers.

When Saidee, 24, joined Facebook as a teenager she added lots of people from her primary school as 'friends' including her future husband.

In 2013 out of the blue Beau, 25, asked her for a date after telling her he found her Facebook updates interesting.

It was after visiting Beau's house for the first time that Saidee began to get déjà vu. She realised they had met before after spotting a rocking horse and remembering playing on it as a child.

Beau began messaging Saidee on Facebook after he found her status updates interesting 

When Saidee visited Beau's house for the first time she realised she had visited it as a child after recognising a rocking horse she had played on 

'We found out that I had been to this house before because one of my best friend's knew his sister and my mum took us both round to play once.

'And the first time I went to his house I saw a rocking horse and I remembered playing on that.'

The rocking horse now has great sentimental value to the pair who hope to give it their own child one day. 

'We've now bagsied it so we can have it in our home and our kids can plays on it' added Saidee.

In school Beau was a few years above Saidee and they hadn't had much interaction explaining why they hadn't recognised each other immediately 

The couple pieced their link to each other when they went to the home of a family friend who was also their former primary school maths teacher.

While they were there the couple saw an old photo of them both together in their uniforms - just a few pupils apart.

In the picture Saidee around 10 years-old and Beau is about 12.

Nutritionist Saidee, who is doing a PhD in obstetrics and gynecology, said that their immediate attraction might be explained by their shared history.

The couple moved in together just a few months after meeting 

'We just got on so well, everything just felt right from the start.

'It was really strange we started talking and he said "where do I know you from" and I think I must have added him because I recognised his name from school.

'We realised we both actually went to the same school, but he was two years above me so we never actually interacted with each other much.'

Construction worker Beau said that he was instantly attracted to Saidee and their joint past was just added bonus. 

'I had her on Facebook and I kept seeing her statuses about what she was studying and I was really interested by them.

Beau proposed to Saidee in December last year under the Christmas lights 

'I thought she looked really nice, so I decided to send her a message.

'It was really strange to find out we went to school together and we started to find out a lot more things, like her coming round my house when she was younger.

'We had so much in common as well, it was just really nice and it just went from there. Everything just felt right from the beginning.'

The couple, from Hemel Hempstead, Herts, moved in together several months after meeting and in December last year Beau proposed in their home under the Christmas lights.

Their old maths teacher Peter Makower who taught both of them in separate classes, said he was thrilled for the pair.

'I'm really happy for them. It's quite amazing really.

'We've had teachers get together but because we're a prep school we've never seen pupils get together.'
