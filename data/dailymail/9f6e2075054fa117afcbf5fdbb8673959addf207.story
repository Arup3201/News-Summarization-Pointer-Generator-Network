Manchester United have confirmed that Wayne Rooney and England’s other World Cup stars will join the club’s tour party to America next week after new manager Louis van Gaal cut short their summer holidays.

United’s players have been used to a month’s rest after major tournaments in the past, but the club are sticking to the three-week break stipulated in their contracts to ensure the majority of their big names are on show in the USA.

Van Gaal is anxious to have all the players together as soon as possible so he can start working with his new squad, and United are also mindful of their commercial obligations as they begin a £326million seven-year shirt sponsorship with American car giant Chevrolet.

United’s first game is the Chevrolet Cup against LA Galaxy at the Rose Bowl on Wednesday July, 23, followed by three games against Roma, Inter Milan and Real Madrid in the International Champions Cup.

It means that Rooney and his England teammates Danny Welbeck, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Luke Shaw will board the transatlantic flight from Manchester just 23 days after touching down from Brazil.

They will be joined by the likes of Juan Mata, David De Gea, Nani, Antonio Valencia and Shinji Kagawa, although players whose countries reached the knockout stages of the World Cup will be given extra time off.

Holland coach Van Gaal has already told United that he is ready to go straight to work after the tournament even if his side reach Sunday’s final.
