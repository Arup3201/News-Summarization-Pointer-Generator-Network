THE arch-federalist in line to win Europe’s top job last night made an extraordinary jibe at David Cameron, suggesting that the Prime Minister does not have the ‘common sense’ to back him.

Jean-Claude Juncker declared that he was on course to become European Commission president at a summit this week, appearing to taunt Mr Cameron over his attempts to block him.

‘I am not designated commission president yet,’ Mr Juncker said. ‘If common sense prevails, this will happen at the end of the week – but it seems that common sense is very unequally distributed, so one will have to wait.’

Mr Cameron insists he will fight ‘until the end’ against the appointment of Mr Juncker, the former Luxembourg prime minister, who Britain regards as an ultra-federalist and a roadblock to EU reform.

Last night Mr Juncker pledged to offer the UK ‘a fair deal’ in Europe once he is installed in the top job, a decision expected to be confirmed in Brussels on Friday despite Mr Cameron’s objections.

‘Everything is indicating that the European Council can take a decision,’ Mr Juncker declared.

The position is usually decided by consensus among the 28 EU national leaders, but it increasingly looks as though a vote may be called.

If this happens, it is possible Mr Cameron will lose by 26 to 2, with only Hungary on his side.

As tensions deepened, Britain also threatened to veto a bid by Albania to join the EU unless there are new restrictions on how people can move across the continent.

The poor Balkan country was granted candidate status for membership yesterday, but, opening up another rift with other leaders, Mr Cameron insisted he would not agree to it joining the EU unless freedom of movement rules are reformed.
