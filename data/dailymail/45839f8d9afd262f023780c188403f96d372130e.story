This is the terrifying moment a flyaway stroller tumbles onto train tracks with bystanders scrambling to rescue the infant.

CCTV footage captured at Diamond Creek station in Melbourne, Australia, shows the unidentified 18-month-old girl slowly rolling away from her grandfather, who stands distracted at a ticket machine with his back turned.

She then reaches the platform edge and plummets headfirst.

In safe hands: The toddler remains in a stable condition at Royal Children's Hospital

Phillip Evrall, who saw the accident unfold  just before 11.30am on Wednesday, told Nine News the girl suffered a 'serious injury' around her eye-socket and was bleeding from her nose after hitting a steel rail.

'We were concerned that the child might be losing consciousness so we tried to keep her awake and alert,' he added. 

The toddler remains in a stable condition at Royal Children's Hospital with a minor fracture to her nose. 

Faulty brakes on the stroller are being blamed for the incident.
