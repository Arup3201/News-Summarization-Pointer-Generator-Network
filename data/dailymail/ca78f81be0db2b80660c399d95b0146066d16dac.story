Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has held up Cristiano Ronaldo as a role model for Raheem Sterling and other young English players striving to reach the top.

Rodgers has the unenviable task of formulating a plan to stop Ronaldo when Liverpool play Real Madrid in the Bernabeu on Tuesday night, having been beaten 3-0 by the Champions League holders at Anfield.

He was full of admiration for the way 29-year-old Ronaldo handled the difficult weather conditions on Merseyside and his overall ‘persistence’ in winning back the World Player of the Year crown from Lionel Messi, having spent a long time in the Argentine’s shadow.

Rodgers believes it is a lesson players like his own emerging teenage star Sterling can learn from if they want longevity in their careers.

‘I do hold up Ronaldo as an example,’ he said. ‘I saw pictures of him training at Anfield the night before our first game with Real Madrid; it was hammering it down and freezing cold. And he was smiling, he was happy.

‘Before the start of the game, he was stood there, just taking all of it in, drinking his water and probably loving being back in England again. 

'And when he was ready to go to work, he threw the bottle away and he went to work. This is an incredible player and a great, great professional. As a manager, it’s great to see people like that.’

Sterling has been at the centre of some unwanted headlines this season. His form has, at times, been extremely good but there was also a link with Real, denied by their coach Carlo Ancelotti, which was regarded in some quarters as a ploy by his agent to help contract talks with Liverpool.

Even more damagingly was ‘Tiredgate’, which was caused by some remarks by England manager Roy Hodgson, who left him out of the starting line-up for a Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia.

Rodgers says his young player must keep going — just as Ronaldo has done.

‘You could argue that, at 19, Raheem has had a similar impact as Ronaldo had when he came to the country; that game (Manchester United v Bolton in August 2003) when he first came on as sub and made an impact.

‘Certainly in these past couple of years, Raheem has made a similar impact at the beginning of his career. It’s now about going to those next levels with the second part of his curve.

‘The first part is coming in and establishing yourself as a young player — it’s not easy earning that respect. Now, hopefully, he’ll move on. He won’t have a better role model than Ronaldo. 

'He’s super-efficient. What I’ve loved about Ronaldo is that you talk about persistence and professionalism in life — this is a guy who turned up for the Ballon D’or four years on the trot, probably thinking on a couple of occasions that he’s going to be close to winning it.

‘The little guy (Messi) is a genius and I’m a massive admirer of his talent, but Ronaldo kept going, kept fighting and then deservedly won it last year. And if you’re talking about the last year, you have to say Ronaldo has been the best player in terms of club and, arguably, international football.’

This week’s return clash against Real Madrid is also a big test for Rodgers, who was disappointed again on Saturday as his team lost 1-0 at a revitalised Newcastle United.

They were comprehensively beaten at home by Real, with Ronaldo among the scorers.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce recently gave an interview in which he grouped Rodgers with Arsene Wenger and Manuel Pellegrini as managers who ‘won’t adjust’ to the opposition.

The implication was that the Liverpool manager was naïve — a charge that Rodgers refutes strongly.

‘I think it’s totally wrong,’ he said. ‘Throughout my time here, I’ve tweaked elements of our game. I like the team to dominate with the ball and control the ball. But there were games last year where we dominated on the counter-attack.

‘When you say ‘‘not change’’, I’m not sure there’s a coach that has played more systems than I have played in the last couple of years. The principles stay the same, but the systems change. We played a different system the other night (in the Capital One Cup against Swansea) and it brought us a win.

‘People will look at me and think I have an identity. I’m happy with that. But as a coach you have to be able to adapt and change. I’m not dogmatic, I’m pragmatic.’

Rodgers is trying to steady the ship after the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona, and an influx of summer signings.

Ronaldo was the ultimate professional when he returned to England with Real Madrid in the Champions League

Suarez was conspicuous by his absence among the nominees for this year’s World Player of the Year crown, with Ronaldo odds-on to win it again. The Uruguayan had an outstanding first half of the year until his infamous World Cup bite on Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini led to a ban.

Rodgers felt Suarez should have been included on football criteria.

‘I couldn’t think of a reason why he wouldn’t be in it football-wise,’ he said. ‘I don’t believe it is fair. It’s the Golden Ball, not the Golden Ball and Mouth. If anyone in the world names the five best players at the moment they would probably say Ronaldo, Messi, Neymar, Suarez and Bale. How can four be in it and one who is not? Well it’s not football then.’
