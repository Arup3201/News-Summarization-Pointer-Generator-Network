A baby boy has cheated death after crawling through an open window and falling 30 feet.

The 22-month-old tumbled onto the roof of a shop below his flat in Lower Clapton, London and then teetered towards another 20 foot drop to the street below before a passerby dashed inside the building and scooped him to safety.

The un-named toddler was rushed to nearby Homerton Hospital, where he was found to have escaped with a broken jaw, cuts and bruises.

Miracle rescue: Onlookers watch as the baby is carried down a ladder to safety

Parents are now being warned to keep children away from open windows during the heatwave, as staff at another London hospital reveal they have treated four young children in the past 24 hours after falling from windows.

Alistair Wilson, an A&E consultant at the Royal London Hospital told the Evening Standard: 'We have noticed a big rise in the number of children who have fallen out of windows during the recent hot spell. We would ask parents and carers to be careful and ensure children to are kept well away from open windows.'

Police have meanwhile vowed to investigate how the 22-month-old was able to crawl from the third floor window of the six-storey building in Lower Clapton on Tuesday afternoon.

Injured and scared: The toddler suffered a broken jaw, cuts and bruises after his fall

After spotting him staggering, dazed on the roof below, terrified passers by screamed at the confused and injured infant to stay where he was, fearing he would tumble off the roof and die.

A quick-thinking eye-witness spotted the danger and dashed into the building.

He clambered out of a first floor window to scoop up the battered baby in the nick of time.

Another man grabbed a ladder from a shop so he could bring the stunned toddler down to safety as scores of locals gathered to watch.

The child's grandmother said that his mother had left the room to get ready to go out.

When she returned, he was nowhere to be seen.She told the Evening Standard: 'She thought he was playing hide and seek games. The windows open out wide and the window sill is low enough for a baby to climb up on.'

Neighbour Agne Turkman, 26, saw the accident unfold from her second floor flat.

She told the paper: 'A lady on a bike saw him up on the ledge and started screaming. I saw him afterwards and he was talking and breathing but his mouth was bleeding.'

Sharon Barrett, manager of Social Care 4 U Ltd in the parade, also witnessed the heart-stopping incident.

Mrs Barrett said: 'Everybody was screaming and then the mother ran down on to the street.

'She was screaming and was very distressed.'

'A guy got on to the ledge to get the baby and somebody flagged down a passing police van.~

A Met Police spokeswoman said: ;The one-year-old male infant was conveyed to an east London hospital, where it was established that he had sustained a broken jaw. His injuries were not deemed life-threatening or changing. Enquiries into the incident are ongoing.'

Elsewhere on Wednesday, a two-year-old boy survived a fall onto concrete from the fifth floor of a block of flats in Walthamstow, London amid reports he had been left home alone.

A day earlier a two-year-old boy suffered back injuries after falling from the fourth floor of a block of flats in Clerkenwell, London.
