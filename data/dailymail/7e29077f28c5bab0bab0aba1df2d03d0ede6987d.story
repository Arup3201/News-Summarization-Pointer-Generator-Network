A psychology professor is facing a possible life sentence after being charged with playing a role in the 1995 murder of a man she says raped her as a college student.

Norma Esparza, 39, claims she was forced to identify Gonzalo Ramirez as her attacker to her ex-boyfriend Gianni Van.

Van went on to get revenge for the sexual assault by kidnapping Mr Ramirez and stabbing him to death.

Ms Esparza, from California now living in France, today proclaimed her innocence before she was taken into custody in Orange County.

Accused: Norma Esparza, 39, is facing jail for the 1995 murder of a man she identified to her ex-boyfriend as her rapist, after which her ex killed him as revenge

She says she never reported the rape and after the murder of Mr Ramirez she lived in fear of Van.

The mother-of-one has now been jailed after rejecting a manslaughter plea deal offered by prosecutors who allege she encouraged the murder of Ramirez by pointing him out to Van at a Santa Ana bar 18 years ago.

Professor Esparza claims she was raped by Ramirez and after telling ex-boyfriend Gianni Van about the alleged assault, Van ‘took matters into his own hands’ with a group of friends, her husband Jorge Mancillas said.

She claims to have been taken by Van to see a bloodied, but alive, Ramirez after which she was threatened with a gun to make her promise to stay silent.

Van told her they had released Ramirez but Esparza learned when she was interviewed by police weeks later that he had been killed, Mr Mancillas said.

After this she was pressured to marry Van so she could not be bound to testify against him.

Not guilty plea: Ms Esparza, pictured with her daughter Arianna, is accused of endorsing the 1995 murder, but she claims to have had nothing to do with the actions her ex-husband took after she identified her rapist

‘All I knew is, that I wanted to survive,’ she said at news conference earlier this week.

‘All I knew was that these people were dangerous and I just needed to stay quiet and withdraw and come out of that night alive.’

Upon graduating and obtaining a doctorate, she eventually moved to Europe to teach and divorced Van to marry Mr Mancillas, with whom she has a four-year-old daughter.

Last year when she returned to the U.S. she was charged with murder with special circumstances and jailed for two months until she was released on $300,000 bail in a special deal with prosecutors that let her live in Europe while returning to Orange County for court.

Her lawyer said Ms Esparza's reluctance to report the alleged crime nearly two decades ago has her facing a murder charge for the stabbing death of the man she says raped her.

‘If you ever get raped or touched, make sure you report it to police,’ defense attorney Bob Corrado told reporters. ‘If she had done that she wouldn't be here today.’

Living in fear: Professor Esparza, with her husband, Jorge Mancillas, who now teaches at a university in Switzerland, claim she was pressured into marrying her killer ex-boyfriend so she could not testify against him after he murdered Mr Ramirez

Van and two others were indicted with help from Esparza's testimony in grand jury proceedings earlier this year.

‘She actively encouraged this crime,’ said Scott Simmons, senior deputy district attorney. He declined to discuss the facts of the case.

Prosecutors had offered to let Esparza plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter and take a three-year prison sentence, of which she would have most likely served half. She declined the offer Thursday morning, and was jailed by Judge Gerald G. Johnston.

Flanked by Mancillas and the couple's daughter, a soft-spoken but firm Esparza said she could not plead guilty to something she did not do.

‘The principle of what they're asking me is to plead guilty to something that they know I am not responsible for,’ she said. ‘It would essentially be a lie.’
