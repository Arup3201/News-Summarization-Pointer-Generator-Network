UKIP candidate Anna-Marie Crampton is alleged to have said World War Two was engineered by Zionists and bankers to create the state of Israel

The UK Independence Party today suffered a string of damaging revelations about its election candidates, including one who reportedly claimed Jews murdered each other in the Holocaust.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage was forced to admit the party had not properly checked all 1,700 candidates it is fielding in next week’s council elections, raising the prospect of more embarrassments to come.

The row threatens to undermine the party’s hopes of making a major breakthrough in May 2’s elections.

Anna-Marie Crampton, a UKIP candidate in East Sussex, was suspended by the party over reports she posted extreme views on a conspiracy theorist website called 'Secrets of The Fed'.

Crampton, 57, is allegedly quoted as saying: ’Holocaust means a sacrifice by fire. Only the Zionists could sacrifice their own in the gas chambers.

’The Second World Wide War was engineered by the Zionist jews and financed by the bankers to make the general public all over the world to feel so guilty and outraged by the Holocaust that a treaty would be signed to create the State of Israel as we know it today.’

Just two weeks ago Mrs Crampton posed with Mr Farage at a rally in Tunbridge Wells, Kent.

A spokesman said: ’These comments are really way out there and really hard-core anti-Zionism.’

A spokesman for British Influence, which is campaigning against UKIP policies on Europe said: ’This sort of holocaust denial from a UKIP candidate is further evidence of the toxic mix of anti-semitism and cuckoo conspiracy theories that run rife in UKIP and she should be expelled from the party and not simply suspended.

’The fact is that UKIP has more than 
1,700 candidates being fielded in next Thursday's local elections  - almost as many as the Lib Dems – and one has to ask oneself how many more of 
them have skeletons in the cupboard.’

Anti-Zionist comments made from the Facebook account of Anna-Marie Crampton. She was later suspended

Yesterday, Susan Bowen, from Boscastle in Cornwall, was dropped as a candidate in elections to the county’s unitary council after it emerged she was once a member of the BNP.

In county council elections UKIP is fielding more candidates than the Lib Dems.

But the dramatic election push could come at a cost, after Mr Farage admitted that not all of them have been properly vetted to ensure they do not hold extreme views.

He said that a ’rigorous testing procedure’ was in place to choose candidates for next years’s elections to the European Parliament, and the 2015 general election.

This tested ’people’s knowledge, their ability with media - you know, full credit checks, police checks and all the rest of it’.

But he told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: ’I’ll be honest with you, we don’t have the party apparatus in a very short space of time to fully vet 1,700 people.

’We have made people sign declaration forms, expressing the fact that they’ve never been part of political parties that we consider to be wholly undesirable. By that I mean the BNP.

’And, you know, we ask people if there is a problem with a criminal record or whatever else it may be, please tell us.

’I have no doubt that amongst those 1,700 one or two people will have slipped through the net that we’d rather not have had.’

Mr Farage has previously criticised Tory leader David Cameron for his 2006 claim that ’Ukip is sort of a bunch of ... fruit cakes and loonies and closet racists mostly’.
