A doctor who became Italy's first Ebola victim after contracting the virus in Sierra Leone arrived back in his home country in a specially sealed military plane this morning.

He was flown into the military airport of Pratica di Mare, outside the capital Rome, and taken to a nearby hospital for infectious diseases, where he will receive specialist treatment.

The unidentified doctor, who reports say is 50-years-old, was working for the charity Emergency at a clinic for Ebola victims in Sierra Leone when he contracted the disease

The current Ebola outbreak in West Africa has killed nearly 5,500 people, making it the worst ever.

The doctor arrived in Rome this morning in a sealed unit on board a military aircraft, Italian television footage showed.

He will be hospitalised at the Lazzaro Spallanzani national institute for infectious diseases.

The Italian health ministry said he has not yet developed feverish symptoms and his general condition is good.

Yesterday Mali said that another person had tested positive for the Ebola virus, bringing the total number of cases in the West African nation to eight. 

Mali is the sixth West African country to be hit by the worst outbreak on record of deadly fever that has killed some 5,459 since the first case was recorded early this year in neighbouring Guinea.

 The Malian government did not provide further details about the new case and how the person contracted the disease, but it came after another case was confirmed on Saturday.

It said both cases were at an Ebola treatment centre.

The government said in a situation report that 271 people who may have come in contact with Ebola cases were being monitored.

Of the six previously known cases of the disease in Mali, all have died, the World Health Organization said on Friday.

 Yesterday it emerged that the U.N. Ebola Emergency Response Mission will not fully meet its December 1 target for containing the virus due to escalating numbers of cases in Sierra Leone.

The mission set the goal in September of having 70 per cent of Ebola patients under treatment and 70 percent of victims safely buried.

Although that is expected to be hit in some areas of West Africa, it is highly unlikely to be met in rural parts of Sierra Leone as well as the city of Makeni in the centre of the country and Port Loko in the northwest and the capital Freetown.

The death toll in the worst Ebola epidemic on record has risen to 5,459 out of 15,351 cases identified in eight countries by November 18, the World Health Organization said on Friday. 

Almost all those cases are in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.
