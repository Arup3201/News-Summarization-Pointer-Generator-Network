A spoof video of a British company's fictional bid to beam a cheese logo onto the moon has sparked panic at Nasa overs fears it could threaten the International Space Station.

Advertising executive James Vellacott and his colleagues dreamed up the stunt by fictitious brand 'Mooncheeze' as part of an annual joke video they send to clients for a festive treat.

To research the script they emailed a junior aeronautics officer in the US to work out what would be required to beam an image onto the moon.

The spoof Mooncheeze advert on the moon concocted by production company Cherryduck as part of a viral video to be sent to customers. However, it raised alarms at Nasa who thought it was real.

The firm claimed to have build a giant projector capable of projecting the Mooncheeze logo 220 miles onto the surface of the moon.

However, in reality the projector seen in the video was a dummy made from just £15 of materials.

The firm told Nasa: 'We are currently building an extremely 
high-powered projection unit to project an image into space as part of 
an advertising campaign.'

But the gag quickly escalated up to senior NASA officers and James received a string of terse emails warning his plans were illegal.

The space scientists warned James' multi media firm Cherryduck that it would have to contact aviation regulators in their own country.

Producers at the advertising firm went ahead with the film - but yesterday admitted they had not contacted Nasa to explain the enquiry had all been part of a joke.

Mr Vellacott, 42, said: 'A couple of emails were exchanged and we were terrified we were going to get a call from federal agents.

'Obviously we didn't think it would cause quite the panic it did.

'We were all laughing in the office because obviously it was just a bit of fun.

'But I suppose NASA has a very serious job to do and they must get loons suggesting ideas all the time.

'I suppose we just didn't expect Nasa to react like it did, I hope they join in on the laugh when they watch the clip.'

The firm produced detailed plans for the project which it asked Nasa's advice on - but space bosses thought the plan was real

Cherryduck staff pretend they can see the image (left) and the machine the firm says projected their cheese logo onto the lunar surface (right) which was actually a £15 prop .

Cheeryduck creative director Jez Furlong, 37, came up with the idea of a spoof company which specialises in children's cheese called Mooncheeze six months ago.

As part of their usual script research the company called the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on behalf of 'Mooncheeze'.

They were told to ask NASA and dutifully contacted the space agency - neglecting to tell them about the joke because they believed it would stop them getting the information they wanted.

Mr Vellacott politely emailed Robert Gutro at NASA on November 27 querying the logistics of projecting onto the moon.

He wrote: 'We are currently building an extremely high-powered projection unit to project an image into space as part of an advertising campaign.

'This obviously is an unusual project and I am seeking advice and guidelines from the many departments governing the airspace above us.

'This may be of no interest to you but we need to make sure that all the necessary authorities are notified accordingly.

'Could you direct me to any department that we will need to get permissions from.'

An hour later he was 'cc'd' into an email from Mr Gutro to NASA officers Joshua Buck, Trent Perrotto and Rachel Kraft, outlining his concerns about the projection.

The email read: 'UK Production Company that is building an extremely high-powered projection unit to project an image into space as part of an advertising campaign and they want to know if there are any guidelines or limitations they should be aware of.

Film producer James Vellacott, 42, was stunned by a glut of emails from NASA boffins urging him not to project the made-up 'Mooncheeze' brand into space

'I immediately thought of the space station, which is why I've forwarded this to you for response.'

But a response from the Human Exploration and Operations at NASA Headquarters in Washington DC just five hours later showed they were taking the joke very seriously.

Joshua Buck wrote: 'There are definitely international laws restricting lasers pointing into commercial air space.

'Also, if your light projection can in fact make it to 220 miles out, we would like to stay informed as it could potentially affect the astronauts on the International Space Station.'

The same day communications officer Mr Buck wrote: 'If there's a potential for the light to reach the space station and could potentially affect the crew's vision or ability to see, we'd need to be aware.'

And in an email later the same night he added: 'It also occurs to me that since the FAA has rules, you should probably talk to whatever ministry covers commercial air (and your version of Homeland Security as well) and see what sort of laws are in place in the UK and Europe.'

Cherryduck still went ahead with its video - and were even able to finish it with their quotes from NASA.

In the video Jez, James and the rest of the production team talk about how they brainstormed for the making of the advert in an 'The Office' style mockumentary.

Amusingly the 'projection' equipment used in the spoof film was just a box made from black foam board and an old office lamp which cost prop designers just £15 to make.

Some of the comedy lines include 'The moon - it's big, it's ballsy," and 'the world is no longer their oyster - the moon is too'.

In another scene one employee of the company, based in Tower Bridge, London, jokes with a deadpan serious face: 'All we needed was for the moon to turn up.'

Mr Vellacott said the idea behind the 'Mooncheeze' advert was to make their clients laugh at the end of the year.

He said: 'We didn't tell NASA it was a spoof because we needed to research it properly like we would do all our campaigns and we thought if we told them it was a fake they wouldn't help us out.

'We obviously found it hilarious knowing the product and idea was just a spoof and that the projector was just something we had bashed together using an office lamp for the purpose of the film.'
