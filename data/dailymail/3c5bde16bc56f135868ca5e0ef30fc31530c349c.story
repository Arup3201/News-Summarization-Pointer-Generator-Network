The ex-girlfriend of Kurt Busch sobbed in court today as she described how the NASCAR champion allegedly smashed her head into a wall three times in September. 

Patricia Driscoll, 36, is asking a judge in Dover, Delaware, to grant a protection order against Busch, saying that she fears for her safety.

She says Busch 'snapped' and attacked her on September 26 after hurling insults at her in their motorhome at Dover International Speedway because he was furious about his performance in a race.

Seeking protection: Kurt Busch's ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll (left) entered court in Dover, Delaware, on Tuesday to ask that a judge grant her a protective order after she alleged that Busch battered her

Busche denies that he smashed Driscoll's head and says she is seeking revenge after he broke up with her 

Driscoll did not call police to report the alleged attack until November 8 - six weeks later. Detectives in Dover have interviewed both Driscoll and Busch - though they have not made any arrests and are still investigating the case. 

In court on Tuesday, Driscoll began to sob as she recounted the alleged assault, according to the Delaware News-Journal.

'It scared me because he just snapped,' she said through tears. 

Busch has emphatically denied Driscoll's allegations and said she is trying to exact revenge against him after he ended their relationship.

The elegant blonde sobbed in court as she described the alleged attack and also asked that Busch undergo psychological evaluation

'He expects to be vindicated when the entire truth of the situation comes to light. This allegation is a complete fabrication by a woman who has refused to accept the end of a relationship and Mr Busch vehemently denies her allegations in every respect,' a PR representative for Busch told the newspaper last month. 

Busch is also expected to testify at the hearing on Tuesday.  

Driscoll - the head of a not profit agency that helped wounded soldiers - has filed court documents asking that a judge order Busch to stay away from her and not contact her. 

She also is asking that Busch undergo a psychiatric evaluation and be evaluated by a certified domestic violence treatment agency.
