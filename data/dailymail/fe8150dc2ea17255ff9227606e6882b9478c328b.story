She may be a highly-paid actress, but she still enjoys saving a few dollars - or, in this case, pounds.

Emmy Rossum, the star of 
Showtime's Shameless, has marvelled at the 'amazing' and 
'free health care' she received in Britain.

Speaking as a guest on Wednesday night's Jimmy Kimmel Live, the 27-year-old told how on a recent visit to the UK
 she suffered a nasty bout of food poisoning.

After being sent to hospital, she was 
treated on the NHS.

She exclaimed: 'The hospitals are amazing there.'

She added: 'They don't even ask you for your I.D. You give your name,
 you give your symptoms, they hook you up to a bunch of fluids. They say
 just leave when you feel like it. You pay nothing!'

Rossum repeated: 'I paid nothing. They treated me for hours, I paid nothing. Amazing... It was amazing.'

The U.S. does not have a universal taxpayer-funded system of healthcare coverage. There are federally funded programmes, such as Medicaid and Medicare.

And millions of Americans have just received health insurance cover for the first time as President 
Obama's flagship healthcare reforms came into effect on January 1.

The reforms are part of the president's aim to ensure affordable healthcare is available to everyone.

But the policy is controversial and the roll-out of the new system has been beset with problems.

Generally
 it is up to individuals to obtain health insurance. Most get coverage 
through their employers, but others sign up for private insurance 
schemes.

Under the terms
 of most plans, people pay regular premiums, but sometimes they are 
required to pay part of the cost of their treatment (known in the U.S. 
as a deductible) before the insurer covers the expense.
