England defeated Scotland 3-1 on Tuesday night's 'friendly' at Celtic Park thanks to headers in each half from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Wayne Rooney, who then finished his second to snuff out an Andrew Robertson-led fight back from the hosts.

Sportsmail's Rob Draper soaked up the atmosphere in Glasgow.

Alf Ramsey’s famous line – ‘Welcome to Scotland? You must be f******  joking!’ – looked a little anachronistic when the England coach arrived. 

There were a few pantomime boos but Roy Hodgson emerged beaming alongside Wayne Rooney and a small crowed attempting to abuse the England captain got little encouragement from their peers.

Things got a little feistier inside Celtic Park, where the pre-match parade of flags saw the St George’s cross predictably booed, prompting one flag bearer – presumably English - to make a friendly gesture to the crowd which might have been a V for victory sign. 

And the PA’s pleas for respect for both anthems to be respected ‘especially England’s’ was, shall we say, not strictly adhered to.

The England fans appeared to have confused the venue – that of Celtic Park, with its Irish connections – with the team they were playing against.

They spent a good part of the first half singing a song about their opposition to the IRA – enthusiastically accompanied by their official band – to the apparent bemusement of most Scotland fans.

Pre-match entertainment rarely strays beyond the banal and the cliche. But at least The Proclaimers' I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles) injected a little life into proceedings and it was a cut above Wembley’s standard fare of Football’s Coming Home.

That said, manufactured ‘atmosphere’ remains an anathema compared to the real thing. 

Former England managers never disappear. 

They can be relied upon to re-emerge abroad with a lucrative contract and Sven Goran Eriksson was unveiled as the new coach of Shanghai East Asia on a reported £3.8m-a-year contract that puts him among the top earners in football management.

At least Hodgson had his foreign jaunts prior to taking the England job
