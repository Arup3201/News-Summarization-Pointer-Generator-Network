Two teenagers suffered horrific burns after a stranger threw an aerosol can into their camp fire at Leeds Festival.

Sophie Turner, 18, and her friend are being treated in the burns unit at Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester, for injuries to their faces, hands, arms, and legs.

Phil Turner, her father, has blasted the yob responsible for throwing the canister - which caused an explosion to flare high into the sky, leaving the friends with agonising burns and narrowly missing their eyes.

Ms Turner's father Phil Turner has called on those responsible to take responsibility for their actions

The Aquinas College student from Bramhall had to be taken to hospital where doctors have had to peel off layers of her skin to prevent infection.

Mr Turner, 52, is now calling for whoever threw the canister to ‘man up and come forward'.

He said: 'My daughter and her friend could have lost their eyesight and they could still be disfigured for life.

'This is because some irresponsible idiots decided to entertain themselves by throwing an aerosol at the campfire.

'They were looking forward to a great weekend away but the explosion burnt them so badly they are now at Wythenshawe Hospital having been extremely badly burnt, not knowing what the long-term impact will be.

It is not yet known what the long-term impact of Ms Turner's burn injuries will be

'On both girls the burns on the face are seriously close to their eyes - their eyelashes and eyebrows were completely burnt off and they were lucky not to be blinded.'

They must now take agonising daily walks around the ward to stop new growing skin from tearing.

He added: 'Whoever did this, whoever you are, you need to man up and come forward. You need to understand the consequences of your actions.

'You need to apologise to these girls. People need to take responsibility for their actions.'

He has also questioned how the aerosols got past security at the festival, whose organisers were unavailable for comment today.

Mr Turner said he would like to see a blanket ban on aerosols at festivals - but said people also need to take responsibility for their actions to prevent a future catastrophe.

It’s understood the family has reported the incident to West Yorkshire Police.

Leeds Festival website states: 'Anyone burning toxic materials is liable for eviction.'

Leeds Festival organisers and security managers Festival Republic could not be reached for comment.
