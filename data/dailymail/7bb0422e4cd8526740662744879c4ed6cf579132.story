A beauty queen who is training to be a doctor said she's proof models aren't all 'airheads'.

Hannah Higgins, 23, was crowned Miss Nottingham earlier this year and is currently studying medicine at Sheffield University.

Competitions like Miss England are often criticised for objectifying women but Hannah believes they are worthwhile because the women involved aren't stupid and can raise money for good causes by taking part.

She said: 'People get a really negative impression of pageant girls, they think we're all air heads.

'Most pageant contestants have degrees and national competitions like Miss England and Miss Great Britain raise hundreds of thousands of pounds for charities.'

Keen to wear a white coat: She said she's always wanted to be a doctor

She added: 'People always assume I'm all beauty and no brains but that is not the case.

'When I'm on a night out with my friends and tell people I'm doing a medical degree, they think I'm joking. They never believe I'm the kind of girl who studies to become a doctor.'

The student from Chesterfield, who already has a degree in biochemistry from Leeds University, said she has always loved science. As a result, she was teased at school for being 'geeky'.

But she said being involved in beauty pageants has made her feel more confident.

She said: 'At school I was very geeky, I used to get teased because I had spots and glasses. I hate to look at the pictures because I was so shy and I had no confidence.

'I can't remember feeling confident until I was about 17.'

Hannah, the daughter of a builder, is currently balancing
 her studies with her pageant work. She will compete in the Miss Great Britain finals in Leicester this month.She also works part time to pay for her 
£9,000 a year tuition fees and has opened her own dressmaking business.

Unable to get a student loan because she had one while studying for her previous degree, she gained extra financial support to help her achieve her dream of becoming a doctor by winning a £10,000 HSBC Student Bursary.

She said: 'I've wanted to be a doctor for as long as I can remember. I have always wanted to be in the caring industry.'
