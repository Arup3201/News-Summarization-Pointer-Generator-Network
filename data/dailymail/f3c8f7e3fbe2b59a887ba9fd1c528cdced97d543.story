Nigel Farage today launched a blistering attack on Ed Miliband, branding the Labour leader ‘spineless and clueless’ for not standing up to his union paymasters.

The UKIP leader tore into the Unite union after his party was branded ‘pre-fascist’ and ‘xenophobic’ in a secret report.

And Mr Farage brushed off a poll showing voters switching back to the Tories, insisting the threat he poses to the Tories is ‘more psychological than arithmetical’.

Row: UKIP Leader Nigel Farage tore into Labour leader Ed Miliband for not distancing himself from the Unite report describing UKIP as fascist

The explosive Unite report was written by Steve Hart, who has close links with the Labour leadership and was Unite’s political director until he left last month after a power struggle.

The confidential report, submitted to a meeting of Unite’s political committee, launches a highly provocative attack on UKIP leader Nigel Farage, warning Mr Miliband not to ‘chase’ his party’s votes.

‘The UKIP vote represents a dangerous, populist Right-wing vote which is swayed by anti-immigrant and anti-European rhetoric – and nostalgia for a comfortable world that never really existed,’ it states.

‘These are all the hallmarks of pre-fascist movements – which is not to say that UKIP is fascist, because it isn’t, but to point to the dangers of ignoring them and the issues or attempting to chase them.’

Warning: Steve Hart, a recent Unite political director, wrote the key report slamming UKIP

Unite has given Labour more than £8million since Mr Miliband became leader in 2010.

Today Mr Farage condemned the criticism of UKIP, insisting it was evidence ‘all that is wrong with the Left of British politics’.

Writing for MailOnline, Mr Farage said he had previously urged Mr Miliband to ‘condemn inflammatory, narrow minded and provocative behaviour’ by  Unite Against Fascism at a UKIP public meeting in Hove.

‘The reply simply never came. It suits the spineless and clueless Labour leader to promulgate the utterly reprehensible and totally unfounded view that UKIP is somehow xenophobic or dangerous.

‘The only danger we pose is to the other three parties, who have for too long ignored British voters.’

Len McCluskey's Unite has become embroiled in a bitter row with the Labour party over allegations that the union tried to fix candidate selection in Falkirk.

It prompted Mr Miliband to announce an overhaul of Labour's union links, including ending the automatic payment of £9million in political levies into party coffers.

It has also emerged that Labour has suspended two local councillors who are accused of paying for people to join the party.

Following a meeting last night, Pervaz Khan and Derek Loughborough, who sit on Middlesbrough Council, were placed on 'administrative suspension'.

It is claimed that the pair recruited people to join the Labour Party after paying their initial subscription fees.

In a sign that the row is damaging Labour, a new opinion poll last night put the party neck and neck with the Tories on 36 per cent.

While the Tories were up seven points, UKIP was done five points to just seven

The Conservatives believe they have countered some of UKIP’s appeal by backing legislation paving the way for a referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU to take place by the end of 2017.

The Tories were also boosted by Home Secretary Theresa May’s success in finally getting hate preacher Abu Qatada deported to Jordan.

But Mr Farage insisted: ‘One deported terrorist suspect does not a summer make.’

He blames the opinion poll on the fact that pollsters ICM do not name UKIP when asking people how they will vote.

'Most of the pollsters don’t know how to handle UKIP, and neither do the political establishment. In some respects, they are all doing us a favour.

‘The arrogance of both sides reveals a deliberately myopic political establishment that would have the UK sleepwalk towards a situation where wholly undesirable organisations such as the EDL gain traction with people who otherwise have absolutely no sympathy with their dangerous views,’ he added.

The leaked Unite report sadly underscores all that is wrong with the Left of British politics.

When I wrote to Ed Miliband after the protest organised by Unite Against Fascism at the UKIP public meeting in Hove, I would have expected a responsible Party leader to condemn inflammatory, narrow minded and provocative behaviour against valid political debate.

The reply simply never came.

It suits the spineless and clueless Labour leader to promulgate the utterly reprehensible and totally unfounded view that UKIP is somehow xenophobic or dangerous.

The only danger we pose is to the other three parties, who have for too long ignored British voters.

What we are looking at is the Left Wing of British politics trying to control the views of their voters, particularly among blue collar workers, while at the same time ignoring their voice.

This is a left wing that feels it has an automatic right to that vote, and cannot bear the idea that another party is gaining credence.

This is a left wing that cannot fathom that it has ever done anything wrong despite senior Labour figures revealing that they openly courted Eastern European workers to come to the UK in their hundreds of thousands.

The report describes the UKIP vote as having the hallmarks of pre-fascist movements. What he is either naively or arrogantly failing to identify is that UKIP is the solution to the problem, not the problem itself.

What he calls ‘the UKIP vote’ is a society that feels let down; a society that wants to rise up against a democratic deficit.

History has shown us that all too often such a vacuum is easily filled by opportunistic and unsavoury political elements that play upon long ignored societal issues and dissatisfaction to further their own ill ends.

The political class should be grateful that a responsible, reasonable and rational political power is representing the unheard voices underpinning this discontent. In the battle against fascism, UKIP is far and above the best medicine.

In the UK, and indeed across Europe, people have felt unrepresented and ignored for too long, while great change such as mass immigration set against a backdrop of economic turmoil has not only been ignored but wilfully swept under the carpet.

Yet instead of reading the signs, Unite and The Labour Party instead obsess over their self-preservation.

Where voters are turning to UKIP, they wish to discredit and destroy our party, rather than seeking to understand the needs of the people increasingly identifying with our policies. The problem, to them, is UKIP.

Not the fact that they are not listening to the electorate, whereas we are.

But it's not just the Labour party who are missing the point about the UKIP surge. Today's ICM poll showing - astonishingly - the Tories and Labour on 36 per cent is a symptom of a political class more interested in polling data backing up their pre conceived views.

Just as the media have their favourite political parties, polling companies now lean towards their own politics with the results being skewed in favour of the paymaster's allegiance.

Just as a bookmaker at a race course would slash the odds on a favourite horse to encourage punters to put their money on the least risky option, political parties want voters to go with the same urge of 'backing the favourite'.

I've often said I thought the effect of UKIP on the Conservative Party was more psychological than arithmetical but when political parties rely on manipulated data sets they risk once again ignoring what gets people voting UKIP.

It's not a risk for me, of course. It's always been UKIP's unique selling point that we actually listen to the people rather than convince ourselves that the public think we've all the answers and nothing to improve upon. Because what happens is that election time comes as a bitter disappointment.

I'm not taking the ICM poll to heart today despite calls from many quarters saying that the Tories have effectively managed to 'squeeze UKIP out'.

One deported terrorist suspect does not a summer make. If the data had been from a pollster who prompted UKIP in the first round maybe I'd be more concerned but the figure they have UKIP on, 7 per cent, is the same figure they polled us at a mere two months before our best ever election result, scoring an average of 25 per cent where we stood.

Most of the pollsters don’t know how to handle UKIP, and neither do the political establishment. In some respects, they are all doing us a favour.

The arrogance of both sides reveals a deliberately myopic political establishment that would have the UK sleepwalk towards a situation where wholly undesirable organisations such as the EDL gain traction with people who otherwise have absolutely no sympathy with their dangerous views.

We are not afraid to talk about immigration and the EU, even if we must suffer the name calling and abuse, for we understand how important these issues are to any society.

These last few weeks, both Unite and The Labour Party have demonstrated a distasteful and corrupt obsession with forcibly trying to dominate the political landscape, by any means.

It is time the Left Wing stopped focusing on their selves and started waking up to what the people of Britain really want.

This blind, narrow minded hostility towards UKIP is a blind narrow minded hostility towards Britain itself.
