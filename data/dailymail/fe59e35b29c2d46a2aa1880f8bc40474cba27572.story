Michelle Mone, pictured outside Glasgow's Justice of the Peace Court earlier this year, was today banned from driving for six months

Lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone has been banned from the road for six months after admitting to speeding.

The 42-year-old was caught driving at 70 mph in a 50mph zone on the M77, near Glasgow, in March last year.

She was spotted by officers as she sped past the junction at Dumbreck Road in her Range Rover.

Mone, from Glasgow, was not present when the case called today at Glasgow’s Justice of the Peace Court.

Defence lawyer Graham Walker, who represented Mone at the hearing, said there was an 'agreement' with the Crown that the case could call in her absence.

JP George Fullerton handed Mone - who already had nine points on her licence - four more points, automatically banning the mother-of-two from the road for six months.

She was also given a £225 fine, to be paid in 28 days.

Procurator fiscal depute Scott Dignon told the court Mone was caught by police driving her Land Rover around 70 miles per hour.

He said she was cautioned and charged by police and made no reply.

Mr Walker told the court that looking at her licence there was a 'pattern of offending' that relates to using a mobile phone while driving.

He added: 'She’s a high profile businesswoman who works internationally, her business has global responsibilities but as part of that she regularly drives throughout the UK.'

The lawyer said she spends a 'great deal of time on her phone' and that 'her vehicle is an extension of her office'.

He also described the speeding offence as 'flying in the face of previous offending' and invited the court to keep the current points on her licence and impose a short-term ban.

However, Mone was banned because her points exceeded the maximum of 12 meaning she was given the mandatory six month ban.

Mr Walker entered a not guilty plea on behalf of Mone for a charge of allegedly using her mobile phone on August 12, last year on the M8, which was accepted by the Crown.

On August 21, it appeared she was jetting off when she posted on her Twitter page: 'Taking my wee Mum out for her birthday Then home to pack. Off to #StTropez party weekend with the girls.'
