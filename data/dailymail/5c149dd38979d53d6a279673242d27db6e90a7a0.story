Astonishing photographs taken by a French photographer have created the illusion that a cargo of air passengers are off to a very hot location indeed... the sun.

Photographer Sebastien Lebrigand, 38, said that it took two days to get the shot he wanted but he eventually took the incredible pictures at around 7pm.

The father-of-two added that the shots were difficult to capture because the aeroplanes were moving so quickly and that the blinding glare of the sun made it difficult to get the timing right.

Here comes the sun: Photographer Sebastien Lebrigand, 38, said that it took two days to get the shot he wanted but he eventually took the stunning pictures at around 7pm on night this week

The electrician's mate said: 'I waited two days to get the perfect conditions, and it was a beautiful evening.

'The plane is so fast it crosses the sun in a quarter of a second, so there was no time to lose.

'I couldn't move as I knew the plane was going to arrive very fast.

'Suddenly I was like "snap, snap'" And bingo, I'd got it in the bag - it 
was magnificent.'

The amateur photographer used a Canon EOS 500D and an i-Nova EDTF 102 Triplet optical instrument, a special lens designed for astrophotography, to take the pictures

Mr Lebrigand, who lives in Crepy-en-Valois, outside Paris, took three photos.

He used a Canon EOS 500D and an i-Nova EDTF 102 Triplet optical instrument, a special lens designed for astrophotography, to take the pictures.

This isn't the first time Mr Lebrigand has taken striking shots that create the illusion that humans are flying into outer space.

Last month the amateur photographer managed to take shots of what looked like a plane flying to the moon.

At the time he said:Â  'I find it fascinating that the 
planes appear so close to the Moon, but yet so far - much like we are on
earth, in relation to the rest of the Universe.

'To me, pictures are beautiful when they are unusual, and these are no different.'

Mr Lebrigand took these striking shots as he walked alone under the night sky. The father-of-two said the aeroplanes looked 'so close' to the Moon as they flew from Spain to Germany

Mr Lebrigand said: 'It was a still night and the moon was rising, almost full. I find it fascinating that the planes appear so close to the Moon, but yet so far - much like we are on Earth, in relation to the rest of the Universe'
