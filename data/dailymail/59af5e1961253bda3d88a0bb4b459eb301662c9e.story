Rona Fairhead could yet save BBC Three from going entirely digital - but probably won't

THE BBC’s new chairman has backed a controversial plan to move its youth channel online, saying the idea is ‘in and of itself good’.

Despite mounting opposition from presenters and some executives, Rona Fairhead said the corporation should focus on putting even more shows on the internet.

As head of the BBC Trust, Miss Fairhead has the power to block the plan to axe BBC Three, which was announced by director general Tony Hall in March.

However, she hinted it is likely to be rubber stamped and said the BBC should do even more to cater for young viewers who prefer to watch television on their tablets and mobile phones.

As well as dismaying those who want to save BBC Three, Miss Fairhead’s comments will heap further pressure on the BBC to close a loophole which allows viewers to watch catch-up TV online for free.

More than 450,000 people avoid paying the £145.50 licence fee every year while continuing to watch BBC shows, in many cases because they access its programmes on iPlayer.

The most recent figures show that viewers aged between 16 and 24 spend just half their time watching shows as they are broadcast.

Miss Fairhead told the culture, media and sport committee: ‘The statistics show that this group are watching less. They are certainly watching very differently.

‘Although sometimes they watch by appointment - either Strictly [Come Dancing] or a sports occasion - typically they watch on-the-go through the devices they have.

‘The idea of moving BBC Three and making it on-line of itself is good.’

Miss Fairhead has been in her post for just two weeks, having been selected as the successor to Chris Patten after he stepped down for health reasons in May.

During yesterday’s Commons hearing, she was criticised by Tory MP Philip Davies for heaping praise on the BBC when she is supposed to stand up for the licence fee payers.

He said: ‘You started from a point of thinking how wonderful it was, and what has struck you is how even more wonderful it was than you thought it was when you first started. Have you gone native in record time?’

BBC Three has more viewers aged between 16 and 34 than any otehr youth television station including E4, Sky 1 and ITV2. Shows such as Bad Education and Being Human attract  29 per cent of this age group on a weekly basis.

Since it was set up in 2003, the channel has launched shows such as Little Britain starring Matt Lucas and David Walliams and Gavin & Stacey starring James Corden.

It has won four Bafta Awards and was named non-terrestrial channel of the year three times at the Edinburgh TV Festival.

The channel is on air between 7pm and 4am every night. It has an audience of around a million viewers. 

However, Miss Fairhead insisted she would criticise the BBC where needed, and said she would encourage it to focus on putting more programmes on the Internet.

She said: ‘I think challenging the BBC executive and production teams to think about what works well online, because it is a different genre, is important.

‘In the charter review, what I would expect is we would get the feedback from the younger audience and that will feed into what we think we need do as a universal broadcaster.

‘We are there to address the needs and wants of all licence-fee payers.

'It will require more focus online. More focus on understanding on how these viewers watch, and even catch up television.

‘Catch up television appears to be a way the younger audience will use the BBC and view programmes.’

Miss Fairhead’s comments come amid growing concern that younger viewers are exploiting a loophole that enables them to watch BBC shows on iPlayer for free.

Currently, only those who watch TV as it is broadcast – whether on traditional TV sets or online – have to pay the licence fee.

In August, Lord Hall conceded that it was ‘worth considering’ whether to change the rules to force those who watch catch-up to pay.

The former controller of BBC Three, Zai Bennett, recently said the plan to close the channel – which is expected to save £100million a year - was ‘perverse’, ‘odd’ and a ‘massive strategic mistake’.
