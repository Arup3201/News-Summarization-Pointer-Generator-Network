A group campaigning for justice for honeymoon murder victim Anni Dewani (see here with her husband Shrien who is accused of her murder) is calling for the judge presiding over the British businessman's trial to be dismissed over claims she has shown 'bias' in her handling of the case 

The judge presiding over the Shrien Dewani murder trial has been accused by an international criminal lawyer of demonstrating 'bias' and legal 'failures' in her handling of the case.

The allegations are said to form part of a dossier prepared by a group campaigning on behalf of Dewani's dead wife Anni that is being delivered to South Africa's Minister of Justice, MailOnline can reveal.

The group, called Justice4Anni, has compiled a growing petition calling for Judge Jeanette Traverso - one of the country's most senior jurists - to be dismissed and Dewani re-tried fairly. 

The urgent intervention was announced amid predictions the judge appeared increasingly likely to clear the wealthy care home owner of all five charges relating to the  murder of his new bride on their honeymoon four years ago. 

Campaigners for the group, which is acting independently from Mrs Dewani's family, said they were 'in it for the long haul'.

A spokesman, who did not wish to be identified as he attends court to report anonymously on behalf of the group, told MailOnline: 'We will continue the campaign and explore all possibilities - further criminal and civil routes are being explored.

'We have secured the services of an international criminal lawyer. It is the judge's entire demeanour that we believe to show bias – her inappropriate interjections, her disrespectful attitude towards the prosecution and no regard to the victim or her family.' 

The judge, who sits without a jury but with two assessors who have no influence over whether the case should be thrown out at this stage, has also been criticised by the lawyer working for the campaign, who has not been named, for her 'failures and bias', the group said.

The Hindocha family, who relocated to Cape Town to attend the trial, have also indicated that they will brief the media next week ahead of the judge's ruling on December 8 despite previously saying they would not comment until proceedings had concluded.

They fear that if the case is dismissed they would never hear Dewani’s evidence tested in court.

But by the end of a highly-charged court session on Tuesday, during which the prosecution argued against Dewani's application to have the case against him thrown out, the grief-stricken family of his dead wife appeared extremely downcast.

In stark contrast, Dewani, his brother, Preyen and sister Preyal, appeared more relaxed than at any point since the trial began last month. 

Mrs Dewani was found dead after the taxi she was travelling in with her husband of two weeks was carjacked in a township on the outskirts of Cape Town. 

Dewani and the driver, Zola Tongo, were freed unharmed, while the 28-year-old bride was found the following morning with a single gunshot wound to her neck. 

Tongo later confessed to organising hitmen to kill the Swedish engineer, but claimed Dewani offered him money to do so.

Ashok Hindocha, Mrs Dewani's uncle, said the family were now 'exploring every option' available to them as it dawned on them that Dewani was likely to be leaving South Africa a free man within days. 

If the judge does dismiss charges against Dewani, the state have no leave to appeal the decision. 

According to legal experts, the only viable avenue left to the family would be to consider  a civil action so they could hear him give his evidence.

'The moment we have been waiting for was to hear from Shrien himself,' Mr Hindocha told MailOnline in a phone call from his home in Sweden. 

'We are still hoping that he will honour that promise – to tell us what happened, to speak the truth, under oath. 

'That's what all of us who loved Anni have been waiting for over the last four years. And now it may not happen.'  

It seems increasingly likely that Judge Traverso will grant the defence's application to have the case against Dewani dismissed. 

Legal experts have suggested that if the judge was going to rule against Dewani, and continue with the trial, she would have done so within hours or days. 

The fact that she requested almost two weeks indicates that she requires time to write a lengthy ruling to justify her decision.

Although applications to have charges dismissed – under section 174 of South Africa's Criminal Procedures Act - are not unusual, they are rarely granted. 

And since the pursuit of Dewani by South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority has been long, expensive and controversial, the judge will need to show that she has thought long and hard about discharging the charges out even before Dewani had to launch a defence of them.

The campaign, which was launched on social media in the weeks after Mrs Dewani's death, has attracted 23,000 followers. 

It has published regular updates of the case against Dewani, who emerged as a suspect in his wife's murder soon after he had returned to Britain with her remains. 

The self-funded campaign, staffed by anonymous volunteers, has posted legal documents, medical records, CCTV stills, photographs and key questions about Dewani's alleged suspicious comments and behaviour which, they say, he needs to answer before he can ever be free from suspicion.

Since the trial began, the judge's demeanour towards the state prosecutors and rulings which have dealt major blows to the case against Dewani, particularly in relation to his sexuality, have attracted widespread comment in the South African media.
