A British jihadi who once hacked into the personal details of Tony Blair has tried to sell the identity of Jihadi John to The Mail on Sunday for £3,000.

Junaid Hussain, 20, was jailed for six months in 2012 after publishing the former Prime Minister’s address and National Insurance number on the internet. 

In a series of online conversations, he told the MoS he would give us Jihadi John’s name and old Twitter details, with which we would be able to uncover his identity.

Hussain, from Birmingham, said he needed the money to buy a car to move his family around IS stronghold Raqqa in Syria. 

He also claimed Jihadi John, who killed four US and UK hostages on camera, was of Arab origin, was born a Muslim and has been in Syria ‘for ages’.

The Mail on Sunday refused to pay the money, and Scotland Yard has been informed.
