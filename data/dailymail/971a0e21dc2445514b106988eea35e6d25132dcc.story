It invested £126,000 in an empty room with lights that flicked on and off every five seconds and paid £22,350 for a sealed tin said to contain an artist's excrement.

But a pile of 6,000 oranges dubbed Soul City (Pyramid of Oranges) is tipped to be the Tate Modern's craziest art installation yet.

The taxpayer-backed London art gallery has spent £30,000 on the sculpture - which works out to be a fiver for each fruit.

South African born artist Roelof Louw sits beside his sculpture 'Soul City (Pyramid of Oranges)', which has been bought by the Tate Modern for £30,000

Visitors to the exhibition, first created by South African-born Roelof Louw in 1967, will be encouraged to eat the display.

But this works out as quite an expensive snack, as the fruit can be sold for as little as 8p each at a market.

Charles Thompson, of traditional art group Stuckists, said the gallery 'has a history of buying dross'.

He told The Sun: 'Now it is paying way over the top for something you can get at a supermarket.'

Visitors to the exhibition, first created in 1967, will be encouraged to eat the display, which works out at £5 per orange

Tracey Emin’s controversial installation My Bed was shown at Tate Britain in the exhibition for the 1999 Turner Prize, for which Emin was shortlisted

Greengrocer Andreas Georghiou, of Chelsea, said: 'I'd love someone to walk in my shop and spend £30,000 on oranges.'

A Tate spokesman said the money had come from rich patrons and insisted Louw was "a significant figure in the context of sculptural experiment." 

The work was created to raise questions about ephemerality, time and decay. 

The gallery paid £22,350 for a sealed tin said to contain the excrement of artist Piero Manzoni

Visitors are invited to take an orange and as a result the piece literally dematerialises and changes through visitor participation. 

It first appeared at the Arts Laboratory, London in October 1967 and has featured prominently in recent exhibitions surveying the period since its ‘rediscovery’ by Clive Phillpott in 2000.

The Tate has a history of investing in unusual installations, such as Work 227: The lights going on and off.

It was awarded the Turner Prize, but several visitors walked out, saying the exhibit was unfit to be considered for the most celebrated prize in the art world.

More than £22,000 was also given for a sealed tin said to contain the excrement of artist Piero Manzoni.

He produced 90 cans when he was living in Milan in 1961 and his decision to value his waste on a par with the price of gold was said to reference the  tradition of the artist as an alchemist.

Tracey Emin’s controversial installation My Bed has also been exhibited at the famous gallery. 

It was shown at Tate Britain in the exhibition for the 1999 Turner Prize, for which Emin was shortlisted.
