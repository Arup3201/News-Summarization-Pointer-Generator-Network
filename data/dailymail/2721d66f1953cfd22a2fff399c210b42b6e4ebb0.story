Kenneth Harry, 43, is accused of breaking into the Downers Grove, Illinois, home of neighbors Thomas and Jennifer Smith several times after their deaths in July

A suburban Chicago man has been charged with repeatedly burglarizing the home of his recently deceased neighbors.

Kenneth Harry, 43, is accused of breaking into the home of Thomas and Jennifer Smith several times between Aug. 28 and Sept. 17.

The couple, who lived just four doors down from Harry in Downers Grove, Illinois, died in July in an apparent murder-suicide.

Harry is alleged to have entered 
their home several times after the couple's death and taken items 
including a snow blower, an amplifier and six Coach purses.

Prosecutors
said Harry, a previously convicted burglar, climbed a tree and onto the
roof to get inside. He pawned the items he took and kept the money.

The robbery came to light after the executor of the deceased couple's estate noticed some items missing and contacted police.

Harry
was taken into custody Thursday morning and charged with three counts 
of residential burglary and two counts of theft, both felonies.

‘The very idea that someone would steal items from their recently deceased neighbors is revolting,’ DuPage County State’s Attorney Robert Berlin told the Chicago Tribune. 

‘The allegations that Mr. Harry did just that will not be taken lightly and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.’

The Smiths were discovered dead in their home on July 17 when police conducted a well-being check.

The DuPage County coroner said that it appeared that Thomas Smith, 41, stabbed 39-year-old Jennifer Smith to death, then committed suicide. The couple’s 11-year-old daughter was not home at the time.

Harry has prior convictions for burglary and armed robbery and has served time in prison. If convicted in the latest case, he could be eligible for an extended term of six to 30 years in prison.

He identified himself in court as a professional mover and father of four. He faces three counts of residential burglary and two counts of theft.

His was bail was set at $250,000 and his arraignment is scheduled for Oct. 21.
