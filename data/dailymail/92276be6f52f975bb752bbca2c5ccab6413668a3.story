Disgraced: Karim Habibi leaving court this morning after pleading guilty to trying to abort his own child without the knowledge of his pregnant girlfriend

A father-to-be asked doctors to help him trick his girlfriend into taking a drug that would make her miscarry a court heard today.

Karim Habibi, 26, wanted to trick his pregnant girlfriend Helen Dean into losing their child by slipping her a pill because he didn't want her to continue with the pregnancy.

Newport Crown Court heard how the Afghan-born chip shop worker walked into his local GP’s surgery to ask a nurse to give him a tablet 'to stop his girlfriend’s pregnancy.'

He even boldly told the 'amazed' practice nurse he intended to give her the abortion tablet without her knowledge.

But she refused his request and reported Habibi to police.

Prosecutor John Probert said Habibi had been in a relationship with Miss Dean since 2011 and had discussed starting a family together.

Mr Probert said: 'Miss Dean took a pregnancy test in June 2012 which was positive and she excitedly telephoned her boyfriend.

'She said he seemed pleased and excited about the prospect of becoming a father.

'But two days later he went to his GP’s surgery and saw the practice nurse, who he asked to provide him with a tablet to stop Miss Dean’s pregnancy.

'He informed the practice nurse he intended to give her the tablet without her knowledge.

'The nurse refused the request and discussed with him the unethical and unlawful nature of his request.'

Habibi, of Newport, South Wales, was said to be 'unhappy' with the response and left the the surgery empty-handed.

Mr Probert said the nurse quickly told one of the GP partners - who tried to contact Habibi without success before telephoning police.

The takeaway worker Habibi was quickly arrested but denied trying to abort his girlfriend’s baby without her knowing.

He claimed the nurse had 'misunderstood' him and said he was in fact seeking medication for his own purposes.

But on the first day of his trial shameless Habibi change his plea and admitted attempting to procure a posion to cause an abortion.

Judge Gregory Bull QC told Habibi had had done something 'quite outrageous.'

Sentencing him to 15 months imprisonment suspended for two years Mr Bull said: 'You behaved in a way that is not acceptable in this country or anywhere else.

'Your aim was to fool your girlfriend and cause her to take a tablet that would cause your son to be aborted.

'That is a terrible thing to do.

'You didn’t show any pity for what you had done, you lied to the police and continued with your lies until this matter was to be tried.

'Luckily, you were never in a position to administer poison and therefore your girlfriend and her baby were not put in immediate danger.

'In passing sentence, I have to send a message out that what you did was wholly unacceptable.'

Habibi was also made the subject of a restraining order against his ex-partner and their son for five years and was also ordered to pay £1,200 in prosecution costs.
