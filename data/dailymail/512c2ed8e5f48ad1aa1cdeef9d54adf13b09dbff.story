The Duchess of York has fuelled speculation that she and Prince Andrew might remarry, admitting: 'He is still my handsome prince.'

The 53-year-old, whose 10-year marriage to the Prince, with whom she has two daughters, ended in divorce in 1996, refused to deny rumours that the pair might get back together.

Instead she said: 'He'll always be my handsome prince.  It's really lovely that we are still a family and the story has a happy ending all the time.'

The Duchess of York, pictured yesterday in Bath, has fuelled speculation that she and Prince Andrew, pictured yesterday in Tokyo, might remarry, by saying 'We're still a family - the story has a happy ending'

Her comments give strength to recent reports that she and her ex-husband, whose children Beatrice and Eugenie are 25 and 23, are back together again.

Friends have claimed that the pair, who have failed to find lasting love with anyone else in nearly two decades apart, are so close that a remarriage might be on the cards.

Speaking at the Bath Children's Literature Festival, where she was promoting her latest children's book, the Duchess was asked if she and her former husband might reconcile or remarry.

She declared ‘We really respect each other and we honour each other.’

Referring to her own 'happy ending', Sarah told the audience: ‘I met a handsome prince and he was very, very good-looking and we had a beautiful wedding.

'Mummies and daddies in the audience might remember it – I think they might have had a day off.

‘He really is still my handsome Prince. We really believe in being good parents for our girls.’

When asked if they would remarry, she told the Daily Telegraph: ‘He’s still my handsome prince, he’ll always be my handsome prince. It’s lovely that we are such a family and the story has a happy ending all the time.

‘In our every day, we really respect 
each other and we honour each other and it’s just lovely to have that 
sense of integrity, to what we believe is right; to what is good and 
compassionate and love and kindness. And that’s the way we are.'

The
Duchess was talking about Ballerina Rosie, her new book for children 
that tells the story of a young red-headed girl who dreams of becoming a
dancer.

She told the audience that the inspiration for her first children's book, Budgie The Little Helicopter, came from her ex-husband's career as a helicopter pilot.

Last month a friend of the couple, who both live at Royal Lodge, the Queen Mother's former home in Berkshire, said that it was 'only a matter of time' before the couple remarried, prompting a spokesman for the Duchess to declare: ‘There is no truth to this.

'They
continue to be joint parents and best friends and try to set the best 
example for the girls.’

But the latest remarks from the Duchess, of whom the Queen is said to be fond, serve only to strengthen the possibility that the couple might formally reconcile.

Sarah Ferguson and the Queen's second 
son had known each other since childhood, but romance was sparked at a 
party at Windsor Castle in 1985, which led to an engagement in early 
1986 and a summer wedding that year in Westminster Abbey.

The marriage was in trouble by 1991, and with the Duke frequently away, his wife was often pictured in the company of other men.

In 1992 the Duchess was at Balmoral when pictures of her having her toes sucked by her financial adviser, John Bryan, were published.  The couple divorced in 1996, but were back living under the same roof at the family home Sunninghill Park, in Berkshire, within a year.

The Duchess was not invited back to Balmoral until last month, when she and Andrew joined their daughters and the Queen for the weekend at the monarch's Scottish retreat.

In 1999 she told an interviewer: ‘There was no reason for Andrew and I to get divorced; there wasn’t another person in our lives to go to.

‘We got divorced because I had to go out to work, and Andrew and I believed that it wasn’t right for me to be commercial while I was still in the Royal Family.’

Andrew has continued to provide financial support for his ex-wife and in a 2009 interview he did not rule out remarrying.

‘Do we have to be married?’ he said. ‘Well, let’s put it another way, I can neither confirm nor deny the possibility. We have two great children. We still look after them.’

Since the couple's divorce, they have both been linked with other people, though neither found anyone for lasting love.

American multimillionaire Steve Wyatt and Italian Count Ghaddo della Gherardesca were both seen out with Sarah over the years, while her ex-husband was seen on holiday with Filipino model Alexandra Escat, 25 years his junior, and out with PR women Aurelia Cecil and Caroline Stanbury, among a long list.

None has stayed the course for either, however, and with the Queen said to favour a reconciliation, it seems the chances of the Yorks remarrying have never been stronger.
