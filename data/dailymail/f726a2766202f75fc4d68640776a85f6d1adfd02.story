Half of the experts urging the NHS to prescribe statins to millions more patients have financial ties to drugs firms making the pills.

Six of the 12-strong panel have received thousands of pounds from manufacturers – either by being paid directly to give speeches or ‘advice’, or through funding for research.

This includes the chairman, Dr Anthony Wierzbicki, who has been given funds likely to total tens of thousands of pounds from five drugs firms which make statins or similar cholesterol-lowering pills.

Bitter pill: A group of leading doctors yesterday urged the NHS to scrap plans to massively increase the use of statins, like the pills pictured, warning that not enough was known about the risks they pose in the long term

Last night MPs urged the Health Secretary to launch an investigation into the panel’s links to drugs firms.

Andrew Gwynne, Labour’s shadow health minister, said: ‘Neither big companies nor individuals should stand to personally profit from decisions about our care. Jeremy Hunt should launch an investigation without delay.’

A group of leading doctors yesterday urged the NHS to scrap plans to massively increase the use of statins, warning that not enough was known about the risks.

NICE, the NHS drugs watchdog, is to issue new guidelines next month which are expected to urge GPs to prescribe statins to up to 10million extra patients to prevent heart disease.

But doctors including the president of the Royal College of Physicians, Sir Richard Thompson, as well as senior cardiologists and GPs, warned that patients will be unnecessarily exposed to side-effects including diabetes, memory loss and muscle pain.

They also accused NICE of only looking at potentially biased research about the benefits and risks of statins, which had been supplied by the manufacturers.

It has emerged that the chairman of the NICE panel which recommended the increased use of statins, Dr Wierzbicki, a consultant specialising in heart disease at Guys and St Thomas’ Hospital, London, has received thousands of pounds for his research from Sanofi, Amgen, Pfizer, Genzyme and MSD – which make statins or similar drugs.

It is not known exactly how much he received but some doctors are given more than £10,000 in sponsorship for their research.

And Dr Rajai Ahmad, who specialises in cardiology at Sandwell and West Birmingham hospitals, has been paid by the firms MDS, Bayer and Boehringer Ingelheim to give lectures.

Again, Dr Ahmad did not disclose the exact amount but manufacturers can pay medics more than £5,000 a year

And senior nurse Emma McGowan, who practises at University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust, received a year’s salary from AstraZeneca who sponsored her job.

This is likely to have been around £30,000 – a typical salary for a specialist nurse – although she is now directly paid by the hospitals.

Three other members of the group – Dr Robert Dermot Neely, Dr Alan Rees and Dr Michael Khan – all received sponsorship payments or travel expenses from drugs firms making statins.

A group of senior doctors, including leading cardiologists and GPs, has now written to Mr Hunt and NICE urging them to reconsider the guidelines.

Around 7million patients in Britain currently take statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes.

They are predominantly given to the over-65s who have been diagnosed with heart disease or have a high risk of developing it based on their family history or lifestyle.

But NICE’s new guidelines are likely to advise GPs to prescribe statins to anyone with a 10 per cent risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke within the next decade.

The Mail contacted all of the six experts on the panel but had not received responses last night.

Chairman of panel; Consultant at Guys and St Thomas’ hospital, London.

Has received research grants from Sanofi, Amgen, Pfizer, Genzyme and MSD which all either make statins or so-called new generation cholesterol-lowering drugs.

Cardiologist at Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals.

Has been paid by Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim and MSD to give speeches or offer advice.

Specialises in cardiovascular disease at University Hospitals of Coventry and Warwickshire.

Has been paid by Genzyme and Amgen to offer advice.

Senior nurse specialising in cardiovascular disease at University Hospitals of Coventry and Warwickshire.

The first year of her job at the hospital – from November 2010 to 2011 – was paid for by Astra Zeneca, one of the main statins manufacturers. She has also been paid by Merck, which also makes statins, to give speeches to nurses.

Consultant at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle.

Has been paid to give advice by Roche, Genzyme and Aegerion, which all make statins. He was also paid by Merck to attend a four-day conference in Milan in 2012.

Consultant at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff.

Has been paid by MSD, AstraZeneca and Sanofi to attend meetings and give lectures. He also attended a dinner hosted by Abbott, another drugs giant which makes statins.

All the experts had declared their conflicts of interest  to NICE.

By DR MARTIN SCURR, Daily Mail doctor

Expert advice: First and foremost, all the experts agree that people who¿ve already had a heart attack or stroke should take a statin, says Dr Martin Scurr

Yet again statins, the cholesterol-lowering drugs, are headline news. Yesterday a group of respected doctors warned that a proposal by the NHS to give statins to millions of otherwise healthy people would be a mistake.

Their view is that the drugs could do more harm than good – and their concern is that the recommendation to extend the drugs’ use is based on flawed and biased data about the side-effects.

So while NICE (the National Institute for Care Excellence) wants more of us to take statins because of the benefits, leading doctors are very much against this because of the side-effects.

Confused? No wonder – even doctors find it hard to make sense of the conflicting information about statins. But this is what I’ll be telling my patients.

First and foremost, all the experts agree that people who’ve already had a heart attack or stroke should take a statin. This is known as ‘secondary prevention’ – statins guard against a second such event.

Indeed, statins are one of the key reasons why life expectancy now is so much better than when I entered medicine. For any patient who has been through such an event, statins are life-saving. Keep taking them.

But there is a world of difference between this secondary prevention and ‘primary prevention’ – and this is where things become controversial. Primary prevention is where healthy people are given a treatment – it could be a statin, or low-dose aspirin – to prevent a future event: in the case of statins, that is the furring up of the arteries in the heart or brain, which could lead to a heart attack, stroke or perhaps dementia.

So who should be taking statins as primary prevention? The draft guidance from NICE is that any healthy person with a 10 per cent risk of suffering a heart attack or stroke within the next decade should be on a statin. Currently it’s those with a 20 per cent risk who get the drug.

Doctors calculate your percentage risk by adding up your risk factors, such as a history of smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, having a close relative (a parent or sibling) who has had a heart attack and high cholesterol. It is not an exact calculation, though it’s a handy tool.

Under the new NICE guidance the majority of people aged over 50 would now be on a statin, and this is what is so controversial. So if you fall into this group, should you now be taking a statin or not?

This is where you need the clear, intelligent advice from a doctor you know and trust. What you don’t need is a knee-jerk prescription from a doctor following imposed rules.

And if your doctor says to take a statin, even if you’re aren’t sure, at least try it for two to three months. The fact is that most people suffer no side-effects and their cholesterol levels plummet, which is reassuring, like wearing a seatbelt.

But nothing – NICE guidelines or prescription pills – can ever be as effective in primary prevention as taking the right lifestyle precautions: don’t smoke, keep to a healthy weight and exercise every single day. That will put paid to the statin debate.
