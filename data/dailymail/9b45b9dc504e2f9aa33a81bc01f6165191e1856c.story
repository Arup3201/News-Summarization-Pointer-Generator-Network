He doesn’t juggle, ride a unicycle or – as far as anyone knows – own an exploding car.

Nor are you ever likely to see him at a children’s party, thank goodness.

This is possibly Britain’s creepiest clown, who is terrifying people by popping up on darkened streets and in the process turning himself into a global internet sensation.

Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that he models himself on a fictional child killer from the Stephen King horror story It, and first showed up on Friday the 13th.

Out to amuse: The Northampton Clown has said that he never intended to scare anyone with a series of appearances in the town in fancy dress

But yesterday the man who has won a worldwide audience on Facebook with his antics in the town of Northampton insisted: ‘I wasn’t trying to scare anyone.’

Unashamed but not unmasked, the figure, who wants to stay anonymous, declared this week it was just ‘harmless fun’.

‘I just wanted to amuse people,’ he said. ‘Most people enjoy being a bit freaked out and then they can laugh about it afterwards. It’s like watching a horror movie. When people get scared they usually start laughing.’

The ‘Northampton Clown’ has amassed an international following after YouTube and other websites showed photos of him standing motionless, waving or staring at passers-by – sometimes carrying a teddy bear or holding a bunch of balloons.

Bizarre: Appearances of the clown, who was seen waving and holding balloons and a teddy bear, had left residents of the Northamptonshire town baffled

Clowning around: The clown has vowed to continue appearing in the town even though he says it is difficult to keep his identity a secret

Such is his following that his Facebook page, called Spot Northampton’s Clown, now has almost 130,000 fans.

His make-up and outfit bear a startling resemblance to Pennywise, the sinister circus joker in the movie of King’s novel It and he has even adopted the character’s catchphrase, ‘beep beep!’

One couple on holiday from Florida travelled from London to search for the clown because they were fans of the film. But although many have applauded his exploits, some have failed to see the funny side.

Earlier this week, a ‘vigilante’ calling himself Boris the Clown-catcher set out to trap the mysterious figure.

And on the Facebook site, Kelly Keen wrote: ‘You’ve been spotted – now get out of the clown suit and start acting like a grown-up... and stop scaring people as some people do have real fears of clowns, and you are terrorising them despite what you may say.’

In contrast, Jessica Maffre urged people not to harm the man in the red wig and white painted face, adding: ‘Loving all this, it’s brightened up boring old Northampton a treat, people need to stop taking things so serious and just enjoy the fun, don’t try and ruin it, and please don’t be violent towards the clown.’

Worldwide fame: The Northampton Clown's Facebook page has attracted around 125,000 likes

Not trying to be sinister: The clown was threatened with violence by some Facebook users after he started appearing on Friday 13

An American observer suggested he 
should visit Washington ‘and replace the clown in the White House’ – a 
reference to President Obama.

Someone
even argued that the appearances captured local imagination because 
they took place in a town he dubbed ‘Nothing-happening-ton’.

There
has been feverish speculation over the clown’s identity, with one 
blogger naming a local actor who recently appeared in a YouTube film as a
clown.

It was noted that a backdrop in the footage was identical to that in a photograph of the Northampton Clown.

Clowns
were first recorded in 2400BC and although they traditionally play 
comic roles, modern cinema has frequently cast them as sinister 
villains.

Meanwhile, the 
Northampton Clown’s sudden appearances are set to continue. He said he 
intends to keep popping up ‘for as long as people are interested’.
