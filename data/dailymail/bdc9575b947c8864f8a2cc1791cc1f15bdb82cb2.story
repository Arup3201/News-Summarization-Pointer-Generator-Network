A missing 16-year-old girl has been found almost 400 miles away from home in the bedroom of a 30-year-old man she met on Facebook, it has been reported.

The teenager was traced to the house in Garfield Heights, Ohio, after police traced her phone records when she was reported missing.

The records show the girl, from Northampton, Pennsylvania, met the man on Facebook and the pair had sent each other nude photographs, according to 19 Action News.

A 16-year-old girl was found at the home of a 30-year-old man in Garfield Heights, Ohio, who she reportedly met on Facebook. The teenager was found after police traced her phone records when vanished from Pennsylvania

The man claimed to have picked up the teenager at her home and driven her 390 miles to his north east Ohio property.

Police have seized a computer and there are reports they have reasons to believe she was not the first teenager to taken to his home. 

It is thought he will face charges in Pennsylvania and possibly in Ohio too. 

The age of consent in Pennsylvania is 16 years of age but there is an existing statute against adults corrupting minors under 18.

While in Ohio, where the pair were found, the age of consent is 16, however, there is a 'close-in-age' exception where a minor aged 13 or older can consent to sex if their partner is less than 18.  

The man, 30, could face charges in both Pennsylvania and Ohio, according to police (picture by model)
