David Cameron's election adviser Lynton Crosby (above) faces claims he advised private healthcare firms how to exploit NHS 'failings'

The Prime Minister faced fresh embarrassment last night after it was claimed that his controversial elections supremo advised private healthcare firms how to exploit NHS ‘failings’.

Lynton Crosby’s lobbying company told clients that the Health Service is ‘seen as too bureaucratic with long waiting lists’, according to a document. 

His firm, Crosby Textor Fullbrook, said polling of the British public had shown that 59 per cent agreed that ‘as long as they receive the best available healthcare, the system doesn’t matter’.

The poll also found that people believed that although the NHS provides good care, it has ‘failings’. 

While the document – which consists of slides from a powerpoint presentation to the H5 Private Healthcare Care Alliance – dates back to 2010, before Mr Crosby began working for the Tories last year, it will fuel fears of a conflict of interest. 

The revelations could damage the Tories’ attempts to present themselves as defenders of the NHS after recent hospital scandals.

They come after David Cameron was yesterday forced to deny again that he was persuaded to drop plans for plain cigarette packaging by his adviser, who lobbies for big tobacco firms. 

But he refused to say whether they had spoken about the issue – simply that Mr Crosby ‘has not intervened… that’s the answer you’re getting’.

Health campaigners have attacked Mr Cameron for postponing the decision to ban all advertising from cigarette packets.

In an interview with the BBC’s Andrew Marr yesterday, he was asked three times if he had spoken to Mr Crosby about the issue but dodged the question. 

He said: ‘He [Mr Crosby] has not intervened in any way on this or indeed on other issues.’ 

Mr Crosby’s role was ‘advising the Conservative Party on how to take on Labour, how to make a political argument, how to prepare for the next campaign.’

Commenting on the leaked presentation, a Conservative spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister has been clear that Lynton Crosby has never lobbied him on anything. He does not advise on government policy.’
