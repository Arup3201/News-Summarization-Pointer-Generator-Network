Jonas Gutierrez is standing, shivering and bobble-hatted, outside a changing-room he has just shared with a team of teenagers at a ground which barely holds 500 spectators. 

The North Tyneside air is biting cold and rain spits through the steel staircase which doubles as shelter from these coarse climes. Gutierrez, though, is burning with passion and appreciation.

It is the little things which matter most to him now. Like waking up every morning and driving to training. The promise of a kickabout with his pals. Sharing a cup of mate – Argentina's national tea drink - with best friend Fabricio Coloccini. Running naked around the corridors of Newcastle United's training ground, much to the amusement of team-mates and staff. Giving an interview as a footballer.

The little things matter when you've beaten something as big as cancer, a battle the 31-year-old has twice fought, and twice won. But the prospect of one special day still excites Gutierrez.

'Yes, I have played in a World Cup, but if I play again for Newcastle then that will be the best moment of my career,' he tells Sportsmail having earlier scored his first goal – a 20-yard beauty curled into the top corner – since returning to the north-east last month to build fitness as skipper of Peter Beardsley's Under 21 side.

'To get back after the cancer and chemotherapy, to put all of that behind me, would be a huge moment for me. It would be emotional.

'If I come back and play for Newcastle then for me it will be the best.'

There have been reports that Gutierrez will never play for Newcastle again because one more appearance triggers an extension to his contract, which expires in the summer.

This, however, is not true. Rather, it will take at least seven more games to activate that clause.

Gutierrez has not played for the Magpies since October, 2013, the same month he was diagnosed with testicular cancer.

He returned to Argentina for treatment where he had a testicle removed and was given the all-clear. The cancer, however, returned in June of last year. This time, chemotherapy was necessary. The importance of football, he concedes, was soon relegated.

'There was a time when all I could think about was the treatment and I had to put myself in the hands of the doctors,' he recalls.

'I was always positive and I told my family and friends, "Listen, the most important thing is to be healthy again". I did not know what was going to happen in the future at that moment.

'All I wanted was to be healthy and come through all of my chemotherapy. But it was hard. When I was first told about the cancer I went home to my dad and cried.

'Then, it was hard to find my hair fall out. I did not want to cut it and I wanted to hold on.

'Fighting cancer makes the rest of the problems seem insignificant.'

That, then, is why he now takes so much pleasure from what the majority of sportsmen – and the rest of us, for that matter – take for granted.

'Just waking up in the morning and knowing I can train after all of the treatment and chemotherapy, that is the most important,' he says, having been discharged from hospital in early November.

The 31-year-old has become a favourite among fans since signing for Newcastle back in 2008

'I love to do all of this – these are the types of things I have missed. All of these things during my treatment I was not allowed to do. I enjoy this now more than ever.

'If I remember what has happened to me then I assure you, I have enjoyed every day of training, every little thing.

'It is a pleasure to be with my team-mates every day.'

Gutierrez has always been a favourite at St James' Park. He arrived from Real Mallorca in 2008 bearing the moniker 'Spiderman' – he once promised a young boy he met at the cinema that he would wear the superhero's mask in celebration of his next goal and that he duly did – and later donned his disguise in front of the Leazes End following a solo strike against Barnsley in the Championship-winning season.

That the Argentina international stayed at the club following relegation from the Premier League in 2009 cemented his standing among the Toon Army. It was not forgotten.

'I was in tears when I heard my name sung on television,' says Gutierrez, remembering the moment he watched a Newcastle match from his home in Buenos Aries during his recovery and broke down upon hearing the terrace tribute.

'I say thank you to those fans. That has always been there with me, always. Through all of my treatment the messages and support from the Newcastle fans was special, it made me happy.

'To be at home in Argentina and hear my song and then the clapping in the 18th minute (in recognition of his squad number) was very emotional – I don't have the words to say what power that gave me.

'It is true that it gives you the strength to go forward.'

Gutierrez, though, is not yet ready for a return to St James'.

'It is hard for me,' he says. 'For now, I prefer to be at home and watch on TV. It's hard to be in the changing-room at this moment.'

Instead, Gutierrez wants to return as a player.

'I have been at this club and in this city for seven years. The welcome from the fans from the day I arrived has been special, I have always had a special relationship with them,' he adds.

'But I have to get fit and be right (before I return). Then we will speak about what happens next.

'If you watch all of the games I have played in since coming back then I have been improving in every one of them.

'Now, I feel really good. Maybe in two weeks I will be at 100 per cent. Maybe then I can sprint past someone in a one-on-one, but that is the last part of being ready to play, that is normal.

'I need to have that in my locker before I play, because that was always one of the most important parts on my game, playing on the wing and getting past players.

'I want to get back to that and I feel I am now close. Maybe now I will have to buy a new Spiderman mask!'

Mask or no mask, when he eventually does run out in front of 52,000 Geordies he will receive a superhero's reception. For Gutierrez, that will be no small thing.
