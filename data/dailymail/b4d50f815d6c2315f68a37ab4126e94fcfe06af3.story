A Democratic congressman accidentally accused Eli and Peyton Manning of sexually assaulting their wives while attempting to answer a question about a real sexual assault case involving a National Football League player from his home state.

Asked by a reporter about allegations that Tennessee Titans player Sammie Hill sexually assaulted an Atlanta, Georgia, woman earlier this month, Rep. Steve Cohen professed ignorance on both the case and on football generally. 

'I never heard of him. I don’t keep up with football, except college football, except Eli Manning or Peyton Manning,' he said. 'And Eli and Peyton don’t do sexual assaults against people other than their wives.'

After TMZ published a video of the encounter, the Tennessee lawmaker's office said he 'misspoke' and does not think that the NFL players mistreat their wives.

'Congressman Cohen misspoke, abhors sexual violence of any kind, is a fan of both Manning brothers, and deeply regrets any confusion,' a spokesman for legislator said.

'His intention was simply to indicate that Eli and Peyton are in committed, monogamous marriages.'

Hill has been accused by the Atlanta police of sexually assaulting the woman in question on Dec. 2.

Last week an lawyer for the NFL star said it is a 'completely bogus charge.'

'Sammie did absolutely nothing wrong. We are cooperating fully with the Atlanta police investigation. I expect there to be no charges brought when the truth is known,' attorney Ed Garland said, according to ESPN.

New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning, 33, has been married to his wife Abby, with whom he has two children, since 2008. His elder brother, Peyton, a 38-year-old Denver Broncos quarterback, has been married to his wife Ashley since 2001. The couple also has two children.

Cohen, 65, is a four-term member of Congress who recently survived a reelection challenge after finding himself at the center of a paternity test scandal last year.

The unmarried Congressman was memorably caught telling a 24-year-old model over Twitter that he loved her during the the president's State of the Union address in 2013. In response to the incident the congressman revealed that she was his out of wedlock daughter. 

Months later a paternity test showed that Cohen was not in fact the girl's father as he had been led to believe for the past three and a half years, a development he called 'stunning.'

Still, Cohen easily kept his seat in November's midterm election, beating his Republican opponent by more than 50 points.
