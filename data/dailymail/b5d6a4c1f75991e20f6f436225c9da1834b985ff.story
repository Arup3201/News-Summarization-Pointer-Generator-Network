Dr Tony Cole said the Liverpool Care Pathway scandal would not have been exposed without the Daily Mail and a free Press

A leading medical figure who helped abolish the Liverpool Care Pathway has praised the Daily Mail’s campaign as he condemned attempts to fetter the free Press.

Dr Tony Cole – who persuaded ministers to set up the official inquiry that led to the demise of the LCP – said: ‘We would never have got it off the ground if it had not been for the Daily Mail and the Press. I am very concerned about freedom of the Press and anything which might endanger it.’

Dr Cole spoke in the wake of the proposal by ministers that newspapers should accept a new regulator which gives MPs a final say in how regulation should work.

Newspapers are thought likely to reject the plan by Culture Secretary Maria Miller because they fear it would give politicians power to censor and intimidate the press.

Dr Cole, a prominent paediatrician, praised the Mail in a speech at the Royal College of Medicine on Saturday. He said the Press had stood up for truth while the Government and the medical profession closed ranks to try to silence criticism of the Liverpool Care Pathway.

‘Had it not been for the Press, the relatives who have suffered would not have been able to link up and get their stories heard,’ Dr Cole said. ‘That’s why you need a free Press.’

During the summer the Government changed its mind and abolished the LCP following the verdict of Baroness Neuberger’s inquiry. The inquiry found patients and their families were suffering ‘poor care, appalling communications and of a lack of attention or compassion’.

The inquiry was set up after the Mail made a series of damaging disclosures about the system, which had been introduced across the NHS hospital network, and which was meant to provide dignity and comfort to patients in their last hours of life.

This newspaper highlighted the disquiet of senior doctors who thought the LCP was being used to get rid of elderly patients and free up hospital beds. We reported the agony of families whose loved ones had died, usually after being drugged and refused liquids.

The Mail also revealed the ‘bribe’ system under which hospitals were paid millions in bonus money in return for hitting targets for numbers of patients dying on the LCP.

The official inquiry said in July that desperate patients were being denied water and there were suspicions that patients had been ‘hastened towards death’ for financial reasons. It said the LCP should be abolished.

Dr Cole, a member of the Medical Ethics Alliance which campaigns against euthanasia and abortion, was one of two senior medical figures who persuaded Lib Dem Health Minister Norman Lamb to establish the Neuberger inquiry.

He said: ‘In this business we have come up against the entire establishment – the Government, the Royal Colleges, the bulk of the medical profession, all closing ranks – and we came in for a fair amount of stick for having actually questioned the LCP.

‘But had it not been for the Press, the 
relatives who have suffered would not have been able to link up and get 
their stories heard.

‘And their stories were absolutely dreadful – people were dying of thirst, people were being rendered unconscious unnecessarily, some very emotionally upsetting things were happening. That’s why you need a free Press.’

Dr Cole spoke as he received the Schindler Prize from disability rights campaigner Baroness Campbell for his work to expose the effects of the LCP.

He added: ‘The British Medical Journal published a report that most GPs supported the LCP, but the Press were publishing more and more stories of awful deaths.

‘If I may say so, the demented elderly who were in great danger from the misapplication of the LCP, are now in a safer place. We must all acknowledge the importance of the Press in all of this from their first description of the so-called “death pathway”.’

Dr Cole told the Mail yesterday: ‘The medical establishment were trying to silence criticism. Damn right they were.

Health Minister Norman Lamb called the LCP a 'national disgrace'

The medical profession condemned the Daily Mail’s disclosures about the Liverpool Care Pathway.A string of professional bodies and charities combined with NHS managers to form a front to isolate and shout down our coverage of the Pathway.

On September 24 last year, 22 organisations, including professional associations and the NHS End-of-life Care Programme, united to issue a ‘consensus statement’ endorsing the LCP.

‘Published misconceptions and often inaccurate information about the Liverpool Care Pathway risk detracting from the substantial benefits it can bring to people who are dying and their families,’ it said.

On October 18, Royal College of General Practitioners council chairman Dr Clare Gerada said: ‘The RCGP is appalled at the media coverage in the Daily Mail and elsewhere about planning for end-of-life care.

'As well as being inaccurate and deliberately misleading, this coverage is creating unnecessary distress and fear for patients who might be nearing the end of their life and for their families.’ 

The Lancet, which describes itself as ‘one of the world’s leading medical journals’, said: ‘The reporting of the story has been appalling.’ 

In July this year, the inquiry set up by the Department of Health found the treatment of many patients on the LCP had been ‘uncaring, rushed and ignorant’ and called for its abolition.

Health Minister Norman Lamb agreed, saying: ‘This is not civilised. It is a national disgrace.’ 

On the day the inquiry reported, Dr Gerada put out a new statement, saying her Royal College ‘supports the move away from the end-of-life pathway’ and adding: ‘We have expressed concern about the implementation of the LCP.’

‘They were not willing to contemplate any possible criticism. I can remember one chap from a Royal College telling me that he knew hospital registrars were getting it wrong, but that was no reason for them to change their minds.’ Dr Cole, who retired last year after serving as a hospital paediatrician in London and Worcester, spoke as the row over Press regulation appeared to be reaching a crisis.

Ministers have rejected a proposal for self-regulation put forward by newspapers that would incorporate the recommendations of Lord Justice Leveson in his inquiry into the culture, practice and ethics of the press.

They prefer a system agreed by the political parties in a late night meeting in the offices of Labour leader Ed Miliband, at which several representatives of the anti-Press campaign group Hacked Off were present, but no representative of the newspaper industry.

The regulation method proposed by Mrs Miller would be imposed by Royal Charter. It would allow the system to be amended by a two thirds majority in Parliament.

Newspapers have indicated they will reject the scheme, which would mean statutory controls on the Press for the first time in 300 years.

Documents from GCHQ leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden (pictured) were reportedly copied on to a USB memory stick and sent by FedEx

The Guardian newspaper reportedly sent top-secret files to the US by household courier FedEx in a move security experts branded ‘astonishing’.

Former anti-terror law watchdog Alex Carlile QC said the suggestion that the paper used the courier may have put the lives of British spies in danger.

He said: ‘I think it is astonishing that top-secret material has been placed in a public parcel delivery system.’

He also called on the Attorney General to consider legal action against the newspaper and accused the Guardian of playing a ‘parlour game’ with national security.

Last week, the head of MI5 warned that publishing confidential documents handed a ‘gift’ to terrorists and caused harm to the work of security services.

Security chiefs are ‘very concerned’ at the reported use of the courier service. A source said: ‘Any leak like this is extremely concerning and part of that concern is the handling arrangements.’ 

Documents from GCHQ, the Government’s secret listening post, leaked by US fugitive Edward Snowden, were reportedly copied on to a USB memory stick and sent by FedEx. 

Last night, the Guardian refused to say how the material was sent.
