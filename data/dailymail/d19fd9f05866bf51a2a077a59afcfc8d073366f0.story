The former World Cup winning bowler asked several members of the triumphant Australian team if they were planning to booze-up to celebrate the fifth Australian World Cup victory

Shane Warne asked wicket-keeper Brad Haddin: 'Are you feeling thirsty?

He then asked Batsman Steve Smith: 'Are you going to have a bit of a drink tonight too Smitty? Are you going to get thirsty as well?'

Finally, Warne asked fast bowler Josh Hazlewood:'So what's the plan - besides lots of drink and that. How long is that going to last. Just one night, two nights? Go and enjoy yourselves guys. Hopefully we'll join you for a few.'

The response on Twitter was rapid. Iohyouforever said: 'Shane Warne currently sounds thirstier than James Franco in 127 hours.'

Another user suggested Warne was trying to get an invite for a night out.

ABC journalist Lucy Carter said: 'I feel like Shane Warne is desperately trying to get invited to drinks but every player he's interviewing isn't having a bar of it.'

Celebrations got underway immediately after Australia smashed its way to a seven-wicket victory against New Zealand in the ICC World Cup Final in Melbourne.

More than 93,000 fans packed the iconic MCG to watch as Michael Clarke capped off his stellar one-day career with a commanding final innings of 74 runs that helped secured Australia its fifth title.

Australian stars such as Steve Smith – who scored the winning run with 17 overs to spare - and David Warner soaked up the atmosphere after their success and celebrated with the record crowd.

The dejected New Zealand team was forced to watch on, after coming so close to giving its country a first Cricket World Cup crown.

The celebrations moved into the MCG change rooms, where players posed with family members and loved ones.

After the win, Clarke said he was thrilled with the success.

'I'm over the moon,' Clarke said. 'To all the fans, it's been an amazing turnout throughout the tournament.

'I couldn't have asked for anything more since coming back to the team. They way we've played, we deserve to be standing here.

'It's been an honour and a privilege to represent my country. Tonight has been extra special.' 

At 3am Warne posted a photo of himself and Clarke holding the gold cup with the caption: 'Congrats buddy, so happy for you !!!! #thirsty Hahahah..... Go the #AUSSIES #worldcupfinal2015.'
