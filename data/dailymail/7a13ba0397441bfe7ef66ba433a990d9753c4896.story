Family doctors have been given detailed guidance on spotting cancer amid fears they are dismissing early warning signs as harmless.

For the first time, GPs have been told to refer patients with seemingly banal symptoms, such as a cough or tiredness, for urgent tests within 48 hours.

NICE, the NHS watchdog which has issued the guidelines, warns that delays in spotting signs of cancer is ‘costing the lives of thousands of people’ every year.

The NHS watchdog NICE says thousands of lives are being lost every year by GPs not refering cancer patients for blood tests and X-rays soon enough, and has issued new guidelines

The UK has one of the lowest cancer survival rates in Western Europe and, for some types of the disease, it is even behind Bulgaria and Estonia.

This is partly thought to be because GPs are not referring patients for tests when they show up with potentially confusing symptoms such as a cough, abdominal pain or tiredness. 

But experts also worry that patients are too stoical and do not want to trouble the doctor with what they assume is a minor ache or pain.

The guidance urges GPs to refer patients for blood tests, scans or X-rays within 48 hours if they have certain ‘unobvious’ symptoms that may have a variety of explanations. 

These are persistent tiredness, bruising, bleeding, or fever in youngsters. 

They could be the first signs of leukaemia, lung cancer or brain cancer.

In some circumstances, GPs must refer patients for hospital tests within hours. These include children who have woken repeatedly vomiting or with headaches.

Professor Mark Baker, of NICE, said: ‘The problem is a lot of cancer symptoms can be very general and similar to those of other conditions. 

Unless it is a cancer-related sign or symptom we are very familiar with – a lump in the breast for instance – many people won’t think about the possibility of cancer.

‘It is not always easy for GPs to spot cancer either. 

There are more than 200 different types so it is unrealistic to expect them to know every single sign of each one, especially when they only see a handful of new cases a year. 

But early referral and diagnosis can help save lives.’

Figures have shown that a quarter of cancer patients saw their GP at least three times before they were referred for a test at hospital. 

Many have rarer cancers which their GP may only see a few times in their career.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt pledged in June to name and shame GPs with poor records on sending patients for cancer tests.

Sara Hiom, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘These guidelines should give them more options to get patients referred quickly. But to be truly effective doctors need better access to diagnostic tests and speedy results.’

The guidance came as it emerged that thousands of cancer patients are waiting too long to start vital treatment.

Official quarterly figures revealed that for the third time this year the NHS has missed its target of ensuring at least 85 per cent of patients undergo surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or receive other drugs, within 62 days after being referred by a specialist.

Over the last three months only 83.5 per cent of 33,404 were treated in 62 days. 

Some 5,519 waited longer. A third of hospitals breached the target, including some where just half of patients were treated in 62 days.

Sarah Woolnough, of Cancer Research UK, said: ‘These targets exist to ensure swift diagnosis and access to treatment, which is vital if we’re serious about having the best survival rates.

‘These breaches have become a trend and they are worsening.’
