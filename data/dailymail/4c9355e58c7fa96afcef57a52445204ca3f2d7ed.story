When it comes to problem areas many of us have an uncanny ability to unearth less-than-desirable parts of our bodies that our partners probably never even knew existed. 

And now, it seems, one area of the body is becoming an increasing concern for women - 'the banana roll'.

The fruity term is being used to refer to a pocket of fat which can accumulate just underneath the buttocks.

Big-bottomed stars like Kim Kardashian (left) and Nicki Minaj (right) have made being curvaceous popular  

One clinic has seen a three-fold increase in female patients booking in treatments to banish fat from this area, seemingly inspired by the perfectly curved bottoms of celebrities like Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj. 

Dr Dennis Wolf, cosmetic doctor at The Private Clinic of Harley Street, where such treatments have been on the rise, explains: 'It is very common in women for an area of fat to form in the crease just below the buttocks. The heavier the bottom is, often the bigger the roll will become because of the weight above it.

'Removing that roll is an effective way of creating greater definition between the top of the thighs and the buttocks, however you must be careful not to remove too much, as this can cause the buttocks to droop.' 

'Banana roll lipo' is often used in conjunction with fat transfer to the bum cheeks. The procedure means the top of the patient's thighs are reduced and this unwanted fat is then added to their bottom to make it more curvaceous. 

The two treatments combined are said to help achieve the perfect posterior. The patient has the dreaded 'banana roll' removed whilst improving the definition of their buttocks for a curvier silhouette.

'Banana roll lipo' is often used in conjunction with fat transfer to the buttocks, to reduce the size of the thighs below the buttocks crease and enhance the curves of the patient

However, Dr Wolf said the effect is not always permanent.

'Patients also need to be prepared to put in some hard work themselves. By toning up the glutes you can help prevent the bottom from drooping and to keep the area tight,' he said.

Speaking to the MailOnline, British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons spokesman Nilesh Sojitra agreed that women shouldn't rely on liposuction alone to stay slim. 

'Liposuction indeed has shown a dramatic rise over the years and certainly more demands for buttock contouring which involves creating curves underneath and also transferring fat to buttocks.

'These procedures are safe if done correctly but patients need to be realistic as to the eventual outcome and remember that photos in magazines are often Photoshopped.

'Weight gain in any liposuction will destroy the results gained,' Nilesh said.

Do the following exercises at least three times a week for a pert bottom...

1. Squats

Stand with your feet shoulder width apart, then keeping your back straight and head up, lower your bottom to the floor as if you are going to sit down, then rise up again. Repeat x 15.

2. Lunges

From standing position, take an exaggerated step forward with one leg until the knee is at 90 degrees angle, positioned over your toes. The foot should remain on the spot but with the knee should sink to near the ground. Push back up with the forward leg to standing. Repeat x 15.

3. Glute lifts

Lie on your back with your feet on the floor with your knees bent. Then lift your bottom off the floor with your weight balanced on your feet and across your shoulders. Slowly lower your bottom back down and up again without resting it completely on the ground, repeat x 15.
