Many women like a big rock to help seal the marriage deal, but one Chinese bride wanted a particularly large one.

One she could climb.

Fang Jing and her husband-to-be Lu Zhao decided that for their wedding photographs they should pose hundreds of metres above the ground on a cliff face.

Wed alert: The unusual photo shoot took place in Liuzhou, in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region

The pair met while climbing together and when they decided to marry arranged for the photographer, also a mountain climbing enthusiast, to join them on the cliff face for a full set of photographs in Liuzhou, in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

Fang and her husband were snapped for more than three hours as they hung by ropes on the mountain side and dangled in the air.

The couple explained that they’re both devoted fans of outdoors sports and that they’d also considered trying other extreme sports before finally settling on climbing, which they both like the most.

All the wedding gear was transported to the location and the pair changed on the spot

All the wedding gear was transported to the climbing location and the couple got dressed on the spot for the shoot.

The photographer, Long Tien, caught in these pictures taking the snaps suspended from a rope, said: ‘I do like rock climbing but not quite at the level of this pair. It was a bit nerve-racking being suspended by ropes and I've never really done such a difficult one before, but the pictures really worked out well.

‘I am just glad they didn't go for a full family group, it was bad enough with two of them without trying to fit another dozen people in and getting them to smile at the same time.’

He added that at the end of the day it had been good fun and if another rock-climbing pair wanted the same treatment he'd be happy to oblige.

Most couples wouldn't opt for a rocky start to their marriage, but Fang Jing and her husband-to-be Lu Zhao were in their element
