So is Phil Jones Manchester United's new specialist corner taker? Everyone had to double take when he took set pieces in Saturday's win at Queens Park Rangers. But he was at it again, as he remained on corner duties. The new David Beckham, perhaps?

There are reminders of Cambridge United's rich heritage all over the Abbey Stadium. There's the John Ruddy Suite - which doubled up as the press working area. Inside were shirts from Ruddy and Jack Collison - who spent five years at the Abbey Stadium as a trainee - taking pride of place on the walls. Likewise, mementos from matches against Bayern Munich and Stuttgart were also on show.

Adnan Januzaj was handed another chance to make an imprint in his manager's thoughts. The Belgian has been a peripheral figure for United this season and, despite the club insisting otherwise, is set for a loan switch away this month. 

Louis van Gaal maintains the young winger still has a place in his long-term Old Trafford blueprint. He still has some way to go, however, before he can be considered for regular action.

Police and stewards were forced into action around 10 minutes before half-time after a fracas erupted in the standing area below the gantry holding BBC's team. Punches appeared to be thrown as security moved in to cool the situation before a punter was led away before the break.
