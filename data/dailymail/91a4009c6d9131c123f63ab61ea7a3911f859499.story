It has been a long 20 minutes but, finally, Phil Jagielka is smiling. Everton’s captain has been dealing with thorny issues that have blighted his side’s campaign when the topic of squad discontent arises.

Such is the way of life on Merseyside that when one of the city’s teams fares badly, stories of in-fighting, a kerfuffle on the training ground or a manager and player at loggerheads spread like wild fire. Inevitably, as Everton have slithered down the table, such tales have emerged from Finch Farm

‘You hear some weird stuff,’ said Jagielka, rubbing his head in bemusement. ‘I think the best one (recently) was that Bainesy (Leighton Baines) had a fight with someone. Now I don’t know if you know Bainesy, or if you’ve seen him, but he’s a lover not a fighter!

‘To be fair, it has been something for us to talk about and it makes us chuckle. I don’t know where half of the stuff comes from but that is the way it goes. The only good thing about those stories is that it gives us a little bit of a laugh at the training ground.

‘We appreciate the people that make up the really funny stuff it keeps us going on a day to day basis People are always going to talk, pundits can have their own opinions and papers are going to be written but there is not much we can do to stop that.’

One thing Jagielka and Co. can stop, though, is the downturn in fortunes they have experienced. Everton were a breath of fresh air last year but this campaign has been one of inconsistency and disappointment.

Jagielka has been through a lot during almost eight years at Goodison Park, experiencing a lot of good times under David Moyes and Martinez, but he has not had to stand in front of the dressing room and deliver a talk to his colleagues about what they might lose.

Given the players Martinez has available, it is difficult to envisage a point where Jagielka will be talking about relegation fights but the miserable performance at Hull on New Year’s Day was the moment he realised Everton could no longer explain their performances as a blip.

Everton are struggling despite Martinez being able to call on the likes Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku

‘I don’t sit there at home hoping I have to make rallying cries,’ said Jagielka, who took over the role of club captain after Phil Neville retired in 2013. ‘But I do go round and speak to players individually or in little groups. That’s just how I am as a character.

‘We have not got to panic stations and hopefully it won’t get to that stage. But we have lost four league games on the run and we have a tough one ahead. We need to turn things round as soon as possible because four points above the relegation one isn’t where we want to be.’

When you look at the team Martinez will put out against the champions, you cannot help but feel they are in a false position. Ross Barkley, Kevin Mirallas and Romelu Lukaku certainly have the ability to threaten City but they have not been able to put it together at Goodison.

It has left the famous old stadium muted and apprehensive but there were signs during the 1-1 FA Cup draw with West Ham on Tuesday that, perhaps, it is flickering into life once again. If it does, the energy from Everton’s crowd and team could give City an uncomfortable afternoon.

‘When results are going well everything takes care of itself,’ said the England international. ‘When it’s not people are down, everyone is a bit more quiet. At games fans are a bit more on edge, expecting us to turn it round, and you can feel the anxiety not only from fans but players as well.

‘We are desperate to give them something to shout about. We are fully aware that we’ve not been performing well enough. You can’t expect to go into a game when fans haven’t seen you win for a month and expect them to chant for 90 minutes. That just never happens.’

They will if they beat City. So why is Jagielka so sure Everton can upset the odds?

‘I’ve got a hell of a lot of confidence that within the squad,’ he replies. ‘We have people that will dig in but we need to start showing that and get results. We need to back up that theory.’
