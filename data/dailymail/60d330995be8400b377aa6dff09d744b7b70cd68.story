Surrounded by music and neon lights, they gathered nightly near a US military base in South Korea.

Now, more than 120 women who used to work as prostitutes outside the complex in Uijeongbu City, Gyeonggi Province, are seeking compensation from the Korean government.

The former prostitutes, who are aging and poor, claim their county's authorities actively facilitated their work in a bid to keep American forces happy, while ignoring their own welfare.

Speaking in a community center in a ramshackle 'camp-town' next to the base, they tearfully explained how they are now planning to sue the government for $10,000 each.

'We worked all night long. What I want is for the Korean government to recognize that this is a system that it created... and also compensation,' a group of women told the BBC. 

The pensioners said that although it was their own choice to work as prostitutes - unlike Japan's 'comfort women' - the government instituted a system of compulsory sexual health check-ups.

This system - along with 'Western etiquette' courses and their desperate need for money - helped facilitate a prostitution culture that has left them even further in poverty in their old age, they said.

They added that the government welcomed their prostitution because it needed foreign currency and was worried in the 1970s that Washington would pull its troops out of the country.

"There was this talk going round about earning dollars by working in the clubs, and that that would would make you a patriot - somebody who was a hard-working Korean,' one woman said.

'We did earn a lot of dollars in the camp town.'

Kathy Moon of the Brookings Institution, an expert on prostitution in South Korea, added: 'In the 1970s some Korean officials from the central government did go to these camp-towns.

'[They did] try to persuade these women who were working as sex workers to co-operate with the US military command.'

Despite the women's claims of a blameworthy system, the sexual health clinics set up by the South Korean government replaced an unofficial network of (often, poorly qualified) doctors.

If it is taken to court, the government may well argue that these clinics helped to protect the women.

However, Ms Moon argued the clinics' staff were more concerned with 'maintaining the health and well-being of the US troops not the Korean women'.

In recent years, US Forces Korea has implemented a 'zero tolerance' attitude toward servicemen using prostitutes, while South Korea officially outlawed prostitution in 2004.

It comes three months after a group of elderly South Korean women sought  some solace for their pain seven decades after Japanese soldiers forced them into prostitution during World War Two.

Lee Yong-soo, 86, and a group of other former 'comfort women' sat in the front row during the last Mass of the Pope Francis's five-day trip to South Korea in August.

The group was hoping to push Japan for a new apology and compensation, as well as a chance to share with the pope their feelings on the brutality they suffered as girls. 

'Today's Mass is first and foremost a prayer for reconciliation in this Korean family,' Francis said as he prayed with the women on August 18.
