The trial of Hosni Mubarak resumed today after a three month break with the ousted Egyptian leader returning to the metal defendants' cage in a Cairo courtroom.

Egyptian state television showed the 83-year-old covered by a green blanket and lying on a hospital gurney when he was brought from a helicopter and taken to an ambulance for the short ride to the courthouse.

He remained on the gurney throughout the hearing and spoke only once to say 'present' when Judge Ahmed Rifaat called out his name at the start of the session.

Mubarak is charged with complicity in the killing of more than 800 protesters in the crackdown on a popular uprising in January and February that forced him out of office.

He could face the death penalty if convicted.

He has been under arrest since April, but he has never gone to prison and instead has been confined to hospitals. His lawyers and doctors say he is suffering from heart problems.

Mubarak and his two sons, who are in prison, also face corruption charges in the same case.

Today's session lasted for only a few hours, and the next session is set for January 2. An 18-day uprising forced Mubarak to step down on February 11 after 29 years in power.

Protests and unrest have continued throughout the year, with pro-democracy activists keeping up pressure for reforms from the military, which took over from Mubarak.

Clashes between protesters and security forces have killed more than 100 people since Mubarak's was ousted.

Judge Rifaat approved new requests from defence lawyers to expand the case to include other incidents of violence and deaths of protesters since Mubarak's ousting.

Mubarak's lawyers argued the killing of protesters continued even after he stepped down and asked for this to be considered evidence that he was not responsible for the killings.

The requests appeared to be part of a strategy to try to show that protesters were not killed by security forces, butÂ  by assailants working for a foreign nation or criminals impersonating police officers.

One request the judge granted was for the Interior Ministry to provide the court with a list of firearm and ammunition stores looted during the early days of the anti-Mubarak uprising, as well as the type of weapons taken. He said he would also demand a list of stores that sell military and police uniforms and were looted during the same period.

Rifaat also agreed to ask authorities for the police reports on vehicles stolen from the force during the uprising and details about foreigners arrested in Egypt during the same period for involvement in unlawful acts.

Relations between the mostly youthful activists and the nation's military rulers have steadily worsened over the past few months, hitting a new low this month when soldiers brutally beat and stomped on protesters, including women, in clashes that left at least 18 people dead.

Mubarak's trial began in August, and many in the country were riveted by the sight of the longtime authoritarian ruler lying on a hospital bed inside the defendant's cage, flanked by his two sons, who formerly wielded tremendous power.

During early sessions, the trial was bogged down by frequent commotion and arguments in the courtroom between lawyers representing both sides. Eventually, the judge banned the media as he summoned high-ranking officials to testify.

The prosecution's case depends heavily on accounts of members of the former president's inner circle including ex-spy chief Omar Suleiman, who was appointed vice president by Mubarak during the uprising

In September, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, the head of Egypt's ruling military council and Mubarak's defence minister for some 20 years, testified under a total media blackout.

Journalists were barred from the court and forbidden to report any leaked details of his testimony. Many believe Tantawi can address the key question of whether Mubarak ordered the use of lethal force against protesters, or at least knew about it and did nottry to stop it.

Reporters were allowed in the courtroom today, but live TV coverage was banned.

Also on trial with Mubarak and facing the same charges are his former Interior Minister, Habib el-Adly, and six senior former security officials. Mubarak and his two sons, Alaa and Gamal, also face corruption charges.
