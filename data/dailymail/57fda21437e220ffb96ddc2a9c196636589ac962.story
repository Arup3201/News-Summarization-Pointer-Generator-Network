One in four women in some parts of the North of England smoke while they are pregnant, shocking new figures have revealed.

And across the country as a whole, one in eight women smoke during pregnancy.

Despite strong health guidance urging women to quit while preparing for motherhood, about 12 per cent of mothers-to-be in England classed themselves as smokers in 2013/14.

The highest rates of smoking during pregnancy were found in Blackpool, South Tyneside and South Tees

This rose to an 27.5 per cent of mothers-to-be in Blackpool.

However, the overall figures have dropped to an eight-year low – in 2006/07 15.1 per cent of expectant mothers smoked.

Despite this, the researchers say more still needs to be done to reach a national target to bring the rates of smoking in pregnancy down to 11 per cent or less by the end of 2015.

In the 12 months to March this year, 75,910 expectant mothers classed themselves as smokers out of 632,960 pregnant women, according to the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC).

In some parts of the country more than one in four pregnant women admitted to being smokers.

For example, of those being cared for by NHS Blackpool, 27.5 per cent of pregnant women were smokers.

In 2013/14 12 per cent of pregnant women in England smoked - this was the lowest level for eight years

The second highest smoking rate was found in South Tyneside where 25 per cent of pregnant women smoked and South Tees comes in third with 23.9 per cent of mothers-to-be failing to kick the habit.

Meanwhile only 1.9 per cent of women cared for by NHS Richmond or NHS Central London smoked during pregnancy.

1. Blackpool 27.5%

2. South Tyneside 25%

3. South Tees 23.9%

4. Mansfield and Ashfield 23.5%

5. Barnsley 23%

6. Telford and Wrekin 22.4%

7. Durham Dales, Easington and Sedgefield 22.3%

8. Doncaster 22.1%

9. North East Lincolnshire 22%

10. Lincolnshire East 21.9%

‘It is 
encouraging to see that since 2006-07 the number of pregnant women who 
smoked during pregnancy has declined,’ said HSCIC chairman Kingsley 
Manning.

‘However, there is still a little way to go to achieve the national ambition.

‘Today's figures highlight there is a still work to be done and it is fundamental that mothers-to-be are aware of the damaging effects smoking can have on their baby.’

Louise Silverton, director for midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives, added: ‘The evidence about the damage to women and their developing baby from smoking is large and growing, so while the fall is welcome we must strive to reduce it even further. This is particularly needed in high smoking areas.

‘Targets for reduction are fine but they need to be backed up with resources.

‘Health providers should ensure there are enough midwives with the time to offer women support, advice and referral to smoking cessation services.

‘Continuity of care is also important so that midwives can develop a trusting relationship with women, which is critical if women are to feel comfortable in talking about issues such as this.

‘There is also a need for support services that work with the whole family. It is important for the health of the foetus and babies that the woman is in a smoke free environment.’

There's a national target to bring the rate of smoking in pregnancy down to 11 per cent by the end of 2015

The news comes just days after research from the University of Edinburgh revealed white women in Scotland are more likely to smoke during pregnancy than those from any other ethnic group in the country.

The study showed that a quarter of white women in Scotland smoke while pregnant, compared to about 15 per cent of white mothers of other nationalities living in Scotland.

Indian, Pakistani and Chinese mothers-to-be in Scotland were the least likely to smoke - less than seven per cent of these women smoked when they were pregnant.

Professor Raj Bhopal from the Centre for Population Health Sciences at the University of Edinburgh said: 'Scotland has one of the poorest health records in Europe.

‘It is vital that we take steps to reduce smoking during pregnancy and improve social circumstances for all Scottish mothers if we are to redress this imbalance.'

Smoking during pregnancy is strongly discouraged because it can lead to stillbirth, miscarriage, low birth weight and an increased risk of cot death after birth.
