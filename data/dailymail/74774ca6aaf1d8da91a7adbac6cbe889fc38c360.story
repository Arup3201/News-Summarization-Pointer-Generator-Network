Swansea are holding talks with Deportivo Saprissa over midfielder Yeltsin Tejeda. 

The Costa Rica international, 22, who has also been a target for West Bromwich Albion, was due to join Evian in France.

But Tejeda failed to report for talks with the Ligue 1 club and reportedly flew to Britain in a bid to sort out his future.

Tejeda, who impressed during Costa Rica's run to the last eight at the World Cup, could be available for just £600,000. 

Swansea have also bid for Montpellier's Benjamin Stambouli and enquired about Southampton's Jack Cork.
