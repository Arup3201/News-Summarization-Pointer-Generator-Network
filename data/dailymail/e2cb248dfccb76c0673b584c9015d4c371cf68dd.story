Yaya Toure and Max Meyer have been major driving forces behind their respective sides' success this season and the pair got together to showcase their skills as the Champions League moves up a gear next week.

Japanese car maker Nissan brought the pair together to demonstrate some audacious passing ahead of a seismic few weeks of European action for Manchester City and Schalke.

Meyer was buckled into a crash test dummy track and launched towards a set of goalposts before Toure launched a pin-point pass towards the German star. Just before the brakes slammed, Meyer met Toure's pass head on to guide the ball into the net.

The pair then showed off their cultured passing games as Meyer and Toure took turns knocking balls into the open roof of a Nissan car set up on a ramp. An impressive showing from the duo, no doubt. 

Manchester City have certainly missed Toure in recent times, and were boosted by the his return to training on Thursday.

The 31-year-old had been away with the Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea, where the midfield powerhouse helped the Elephants to victory.

City suffered in Toure's absence. Manuel Pellegrini's side managed just one win while the midfielder was with his national side, and that came on Wednesday against Stoke.

Meyer, meanwhile, will feature for Schalke as the German club welcome Real Madrid to the Veltins-Arena in their Champions League last 16 clash next Wednesday.

Meyer, who made his debut for the club as a 17-year-old in February 2013, has gone from strength to strength with the club.

The young midfielder scored the decisive goal against Maribor that booked Schalke a place in the knockout stages.
