When dinnertime arrives on the sun-scorched savannah of Kenya's Maasai Mara, you either fight for your life or your livelihood... but it doesn't always go according to plan.

As this incredible series of photographs show, there is one kind of free dinner that likes being free, and will fight hoof and tail to keep it that way.

So when Malaika the cheetah tried to hunt down a young wildebeest, the plucky calf stood its ground and gave the predator a nasty surprise.

Tables turned: As this incredible series of photographs show, there is one kind of free dinner that likes being free, and will fight hoof and tail to keep it that way

Charge: The cheetah dodges the wildebeest's horns as it lunges in the long grass

Easy target? The wildebeest calf was slightly slower than the rest of the adult wildebeest and looked like an easy target

The images, taken by British photographer Manoj Shah, show the wildebeest fought back sending the cheetah running from its horns.

The cheetah - named Malaika by local guides - had been tracked for several days by Manoj's party studying her hunting habits.

Manoj said: 'The cheetah mother Malaika had to hunt every day or two to feed herself and the fast growing cub.

'I was taking her pictures as she was 
seated with the cub on a termite mound. By being on top of the mound the
cheetah could scan the vast savanna grassland and easily spot any prey.

Attack: Moving at top speed, the cheetah caught up with the wildebeest calf and put her front two feet on the wildebeests back, trying to bring it down

Hanging on: She tried to hold on to the wildebeest as it thrashed about trying to break free

Ferocious: The young wildebeest turns, dips its horns and charges at the unsuspecting cheetah in a last-ditch bid to save its own life

'This was necessary because the grass 
was taller than the cheetah's height and therefore she had to be taller 
than the grass by climbing on top of a mound.

'While
on the mound, the cheetah - with a much more powerful eyesight than 
humans - noticed a line of wildebeest moving across the grassland. I was
using binoculars all the time.

'She
quickly left the cub on the mound and started walking fast to the line 
of the wildebeest. Her walk turned into a fast sprint at at approximate 
distance of 100 metres from the wildebeest group.'

Tussle: An almighty tussle broke out between the two as the wildebeest fought for its life and the cheetah its livelihood

Wild frenzy: The pair circled each other, locked in battle, as - for a brief moment - the hunted became the hunter

Victory: Incredibly, the cheetah ends up giving up the chase and running away

Manoj said the cheetah quickly singled out a potential target.

He said: 'Cheetahs are known to reach a speed of about 100 kmph in a few seconds.

'The wildebeest started running on 
spotting the fast encroaching cheetah. The wildebeest calf was slightly 
slower than the rest of the adult wildebeest and became an easy target.

'Moving
at top speed, the cheetah caught up with the wildebeest calf and put 
her front two feet on the wildebeests back, trying to bring it down.

Snapper: The pictures were taken by British photographer Manoj Shah who had been tracking the cheetah for several days, studying her hunting habits

Majestic: Shah was taking her pictures as she was seated with the cub on a termite mound. By being on top of the mound the cheetah could scan the vast savanna grassland and easily spot any prey

'But the wildebeest calf was brave and a strong fighter. It could not be brought down but instead it turned to face the cheetah, throwing off the cheetah on the ground.

'The wildebeest calf then charged with its horns and the scared the cheetah ran off.

Being at a slight disadvantage the cheetah did not want to get injured as her cub was totally dependent on her hunting skills. So she let the wildebeest go.'
