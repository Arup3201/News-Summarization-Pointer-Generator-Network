The body of 63-year-old Sang Ho Kim was found near a bridge north of New York City

A body found floating in the Hudson River was identified on Monday as the suspect wanted in a workplace shooting in suburban New York that left one man dead and a second in critical condition, police said.

The body was found near a bridge at about 9.30 am today, according to state police.

It was taken to a medical examiner's office, where it was later identified as that of 63-year-old Sang Ho Kim of Queens, according to Inspector Kenneth Lack of the Nassau County police department.

Nassau County police said it appeared Kim had been embroiled in a business dispute with officials at Savenergy, a light fixture import firm, when he walked into the company's Garden City office last Wednesday morning and opened fire.

'There was some disgruntlement between him and the company he was attacking,' Nassau County Police Chief Steven Skrynecki said last week.

An employee, 25-year-old Zachariah Yong Jae Shin, was killed, and the company's chief executive, John Choi, was wounded.

Because the shooting happened near the Roosevelt Field mall, businesses and schools in the area went into a temporary lockdown for hours.

Some shoppers later said they had fleeting fears that it might have been a replay of the terrorist attack that occurred at a mall in Kenya the preceding weekend.

The hunt for Kim later stretched from 
Long Island to the northern New York City suburbs after his SUV was 
located at a park in Cold Spring, N.Y., about 12 hours after the 
shooting.

Authorities employed dogs, helicopters and boats for several days in pursuit of the suspect through rough, mountainous terrain.

His body was found about 10 miles south of Cold Spring.

Police did not reveal further details 
about the dispute Kim had with the company. Kim's sister told Newsday 
last week that her brother had been cheated out of an undetermined 
amount of money; the sister later said Kim had called her after the 
shooting, threatening suicide.

The
company's website said it develops energy reduction technology that 
promises to reduce lighting, air conditioning, heating and electrical 
costs.
