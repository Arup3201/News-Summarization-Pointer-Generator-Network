At just 19-years old and stunningly beautiful, straight-A chemistry student Alyssa Funke took her own life weeks after she dabbled in the seedy world of amateur porn and was mercilessly taunted for her decision.

Miss Funke, who wanted to be an anesthesiologist, decided to take part in a sex video with a stranger in Las Vegas for website CastingCouch-X, using the name 'Stella Ann'.

Days after the sex tape of the teenager, from Stillwater, Minnesota, was posted online in March, abusive messages flooded her social media accounts, many from her former schoolmates at Stillwater High.

Straight-A chemistry student Alyssa Funke, 19, from Miinnesota, took her own life two weeks after she dabbled in amateur porn and was mercilessly taunted for it

The messages, ranged from gossipy and sarcastic to nasty slurs about the University of Wisconsin student.

High school students had reportedly gathered around tables in the cafeteria to watch the teen's sex tape on their cellphones, according to KMSP-TV.

One called Miss Funke a 'thot', a slang word for prostitute, adding: 'Does her dad know?'

Another message sniped: 'Nothing brings a school together like a porn star who graduated last year.'

Miss Funke fought back - defending herself. She tweeted: 'Pornstar status' and 'FAMOUS for dayzzzzz.'

The last message she posted on Facebook on March 4 read: 'The people that envy & hate you the most, stalk you on social media the most so, hey hi hello how r u doing, this ones for you.'

She wrote a post to her 'future husband' and about vulnerable message about wanting a relationship where you 'never feel unwanted or alone'.

Funke went to Las Vegas for her interview with CastingCouch-X in March where she called herself Stella Ann. She appeared nervous on the tape and talked about her real dreams of becoming an anesthesiologist

During her interview for the amateur porn site in March, Alyssa Funke, who called herself 'Ann' looked nervous and described her college plans and described her childhood as 'pretty much normal'

The 19-year-old did not know the easiest of childhoods, despite describing her past with a shrug in her porn video interview as 'pretty much' normal.

Her biological father Rashad Bowman was jailed in 2001 for fraud in Maricopa County, Arizona.

Court records show that as a young girl, Alyssa tried to keep in contact with her father using audio tapes.

Her mother and a boyfriend were charged with drug-dealing. Family told KMSP-TV that the teenager had money worries and struggled with depression.

Despite brushing off the taunts from her peers, the words affected her, family said. On April 17, the teenager bought a shotgun, drove to Big Carnelia Lake and killed herself on her family's boat.

The teenage college student had a troubled upbringing with her father in jail in Arizona and her mother and a boyfriend arrested for dealing drugs

Her devastated family, who have been unwilling to speak publicly on her tragic death, launched The Alyssa Stop Bullying Fund, which has so far raised just $165.

On the site, a family message reads: 'On Wednesday April 16, at the young age of 19 Alyssa Funke took her 
own life. Alyssa like so many other teens was a victim of bully and 
sadly the bullying lead to her death.'

According to KMSP-TV, Miss Funke's video remains on their website. Attempts to contact the site have so far been unsuccessful.

The local sheriff's office is investigating the teenager's death but does not believe that the messages sent to Miss Funke amount to criminal harassment.

Miss Funke's story draws similarities with Duke student Miriam Weeks, 18, who was outed as porn star Belle Knox earlier this year and also sat on the same Vegas couch for CastingCouch-X.

Miss Knox, a women's studies major, made headlines earlier this year when one of her classmates outed her secret life as a porn star to the student body.  

Since then, she has defended her decision to enter the adult film world on Piers Morgan Live, The View and other talk shows.
