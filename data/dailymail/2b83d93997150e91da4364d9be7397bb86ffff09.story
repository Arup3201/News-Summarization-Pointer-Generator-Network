LeBron James, the NBA's biggest star, is on the market - and the entire sports world is speculating where he might take his talents next.

News has leaked today that James is opting out of the final two years of his $42.7million deal with the Miami Heat and has become a free agent - meaning any team in the league could bid to take him on, multiple news outlets are reporting.

Opting out does not mean the 29-year-old James has decided to leave the Heat, the team James has led to four-straight NBA finals and two championships. Pundits say it's entirely possible - even likely - that LeBron is simply giving himself a chance to re-negotiate his contract with Miami.

This year's team, widely considered the weakest since he moved to Miami in 2010, was mauled by the San Anontio Spurs in the finals - losing four games to one. Some have suggested LeBron may be positioning himself to take a pay cut so that the Heat can bring in new players while staying within the NBA's salary cap.

Taking his talents elsewhere? Four years after landing at the Heat, LeBrong James opted out of the final two years of his contract and became a free agent - signaling he could be leaving South Beach

Disappointing: James and the Heat made the NBA finals this season, but were thrashed by the San Antonio Spurs, four games to one

James' wife, Savannah, caused much excitement in Ohio when she posted a picture of the couple's hometown of Akron and the message 'The countdown is real!'

However, news that LeBron could be moving has set the NBA aflutter, including with speculation that he could be returning to his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers, the hometown team he spurned on national television when he famously announced that he planned to 'take his talents to South Beach.'

His wife, high school sweetheart Savannah, recently announced she was pregnant with the couple's third child, a girl.

She set tongues wagging in Ohio two days ago when she posted a photo of the couple's hometown of Akron on Instagram and wrote: 'Home sweet home!! The countdown is real! #330.'

Many experts say a move back home to Cleveland is a long shot - the team has languished since he left and was unable to attract the kind of talent who could help James win a championship during the seven seasons he was there. The Cavaliers reached the NBA finals only once while Lebron was there, but lost to the Spurs.

When LeBron James left the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Miami Heat in 2010, he signed a six-year, $110million contract.

Here were the top salaries for the 2013-2014 season:

The announcement Tuesday from James' agent Rich Paul has sent shock waves through the NBA. James' moves could potentially reshape the league and turn any team he's on into a potential championship contender.

He has already shown a willingness to take less money than he's worth if it means playing on a winning team. In 2010, he signed a six-year, $110million contract with the Heat.

His $19.1million salary last season was far from the highest in the NBA  - despite James being regarded the best player in the league. Last season, Kobe Bryant, the aging Los Angeles Lakers superstar, earned $30.4million.

The NBA uses salary cap rules. By taking less money than he was likely worth, the Heat could also afford to pay stars Chris Bosh and Dwayne Wade, who helped James reach the NBA finals four times in a row.

To be sure, James doesn't go wanting. His status as the biggest star in the NBA - and likely the biggest star in all of American sports, allowed him to rake in $39million in endorsement deals last year from the likes of Nike, McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Samsung.

Only boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr raked in more cash overall in 2013. 

Grantland's Zach Lowe writes that James could potentially go to any team he wanted. However, he's likely to pick the option that will allow him to continue winning championships.

The most likely option, according to Lowe, is that James will stay in Miami - albeit with an augmented contract and assurances from Heat management that the team is committed to

Other top contenders for James' talents are the Chicago Bulls, the Houston Rockets, the Phoenix Suns and the Atlanta Hawks, Lowe says. 

Returning home? James has maintained his connection to his hometown of Akron with his charity - even after he left the Cleveland Cavaliers for Miami

James and his wife reportedly enjoy living in Miami - but James proved with 'the Decision' that he's willing to uproot in order to in championships

Selecting the Bulls would be a symbolic move. Chicago has been looking to reclaim its glory days ever since the 1990s, when the team won six out of eight championships with Michael Jordan.

James, who has been compared to Michael Jordan his entire career, is highly conscious of both his image and his legacy.

A return to Cleveland, though an intriguing storyline for James, could be dicey. Many fans are still bitter about 'the Decision,' a 2010 live ESPN broadcast in which James announced on national television that he was leaving his hometown and 'taking his talents to South Beach.'
