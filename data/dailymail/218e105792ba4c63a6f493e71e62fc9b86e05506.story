It's been less than 48 hours, but Occupy Oakland will have to find yet another location to pitch their tents.

Demonstrators claimed a vacant lot and adjacent public park five blocks from Frank Ogawa Plaza as their new encampment Saturday, but were forced to clear out after an early morning police raid.

Police cleared both areas out, non-violently and without incident.

Clearing out: Police evicted Occupy Oakland protesters a day after they claimed a vacant lot as their own

According to Oakland police spokeswoman Johnna Watson, there were no arrests or injuries.

Demonstrators said police gave them a 20-minute warning to take their tents and leave, and began moving in around 8:40am. Ms Watson described the protesters as ‘very cooperative.’

After the new camp was cleared out, around 150 people lingered at the site, Mercury News reported. Some yelled at police officers while others merely looked on.

Evicted: Campers carried their tents and signs from the vacant lot, which is five blocks north of the original encampment

Mayor Jean Quan said Sunday morning 
justified the raid, saying the continued Occupy movement was straining 
the city’s already overwrought budget and law enforcement resources.

‘We will not tolerate lodging on public property, whether in parks or open space; it is illegal,’ Ms Quan said.

Though the protesters were compliant today, they recently announced plans to shut down all West Coast ports on December 12 in coordination with like-minded protesters in Los Angeles.

Saturday night, those in the Occupy Oakland protest 
broke through a chain link and jumped up and down on no-trespassing 
signs to the sound of cheers and beating drums.

They also pitched tents,
with the hope of holding their ground overnight.

after a fatal shooting prompted them to act.

For weeks, tensions had 
been rising in an already strained environment.

A clash in October between Oakland police and protestors injured a former US Marine and sparked national attention to Occupy Oakland, as well as an outpouring of support for the Occupy Wall Street movement.

Oakland police and Ms Quan said they would not allow another camp, but did not immediately intervene.

Defiance: Mayor Jean Quan said protesters were not allowed to camp overnight, but that didn't stop protestors from pitching tents

Instead, the police said they have a ‘non-confrontational strategy’ for preventing the campsite.

Ms Watson said in a written statement that peaceful protest is acceptable, including ‘peaceful forms of expression and freedom of speech.

‘Acts of violence, property destruction, and overnight lodging will not be tolerated,’ she wrote.

New digs: The lot is in the middle of a residential neighbourhood. Many residents aren't happy with the movement's newest home

She said that police were surrounding buildings around the reclaimed lot, and streets had been closed.

No one was arrested Saturday night, police said.

Some local residents were upset with the new camp, which is five blocks north of Frank Ogawa plaza, and in a gentrifying area of the city.

Ours: Demonstrators took to the streets and marched from the old camp, brandishing signs, flags, and banners. Police did not take immediate action in evicting them from the lot

Mass exodus: There were around 1,000 people marching throughout downtown Oakland Saturday

Oakland resident Sherbeam Wright, who lives in a nearby building, told the San Francisco Chronicle: ‘We want people to know the people who live here care about what’s going on.’

He said schoolchildren from the nearby Oakland School for the Arts often eat lunch in the park the Occupy Oakland movement now calls home base.

Message for the mayor: Occupy Oakland protesters had a message for Mayor Quan, who said the plaza is still for public use, but banned camping

‘This is not an empty space, this is a community,’ Mr Wright said.

Marylou Beba, 70, who marched from old camp to new, agreed. ‘I think we should all occupy our homes, and the Occupy movement should occupy banks, civic centres, places like that,’ she told the Oakland Tribune.
