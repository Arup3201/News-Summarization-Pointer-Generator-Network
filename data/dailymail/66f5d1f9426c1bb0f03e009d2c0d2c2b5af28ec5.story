She was mentored to X Factor victory by Simon Cowell who declared at the time 'he was the proudest person in the world'.

On Tuesday, the music mogul announced he and his protege had parted company after seven years following a decision made by Syco Records not to renew her contract.

Sources close to Miss Lewis, who is still the richest winner of the TV talent show having acquired a fortune of £13million, claim Cowell no longer understood the direction she wanted to take with her music.

The star was in negotiations with another Sony label, but has now signed a deal with rival
 label Island Records, which has artists including Robbie Williams and 
rapper Nicki Minaj on its roster.

In a statement Miss Lewis said: ‘After seven incredible years at Sony I feel honoured to be given the opportunity to sign to perhaps the most iconic label of all, Island Records.

‘To me Island has always been a label where artists can really flourish and are encouraged to express themselves.’

A music industry source added: 'Syco decided they were not going to make another album with Leona on Syco. There were ‎then discussions with another Sony label, but they didn't work out - and she went to Island.'

Miss Lewis’ debut 2007 single Bleeding Love topped the charts in 30 countries including the UK and at the time helped her become the first British female to top the US charts for 20 years.

Miss Lewis has received seven Brit nominations and three Grammy nominations during her career so far and released four albums including a festive album in December last year: Christmas, With Love.

She's enjoyed three No.1 UK singles and a further six top 10 singles, as well as two No.1 albums.

However, her last studio album Glassheart reached No.3 in the UK album charts in 2012, selling 60,000 copies in the UK, compared to 3.1million of her debut album Spirit five years earlier.

Cowell, 54, took to social networking site Twitter to wish Miss Lewis well and reminded his almost 10 million followers how important she was to The X Factor.

He posted: ‘Congratulations Leona. We had 7 great years together and now wish you all the best for the future.

‘You put X Factor on the map. X.'
