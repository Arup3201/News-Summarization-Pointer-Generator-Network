A sham marriage scam was rumbled after a fake bride went on holiday with another man only six days after her wedding to a Vietnamese groom.

Amanda Nolan, 28, was handed £5,000 to enter into a ‘marriage of convenience’ arranged in her local nail salon.

She used the cash to pay for a two-week holiday in Mexico with John Doyle. But after they fell out while away, he told the police the trip had been paid for by the wedding scam.

It led to Nolan, Kevin Donnelly, Jason
Proctor, Denny Wallace and Gemma Nelson appearing at Preston Crown 
Court accused of entering into, or witnessing, sham weddings to keep 
Vietnamese immigrants in the UK on marriage visas.

The court heard that Britons were 
offered up to £10,000 to enter into the ‘marriages of convenience’ with 
the Vietnamese, who were on temporary visas.

Trang Thi Thuy Luu, known as Louise, 
was the ‘spider at the centre of a web’. The Vietnamese nail bar owner 
was the chief organiser of a ‘carefully orchestrated operation’ to match
Britons to her friends and family in bogus ceremonies.

Luu, 24, who is 
now on the run, used her connections as the manager of three Miss Nails 
nail bars in Preston, Chorley and Blackburn to entice three Britons into
sham weddings between 2008 and 2010.

It enabled her friends and family to successfully apply to the Home Office for visas to remain in Britain.

Elizabeth Nicholls, prosecuting, said:
‘She arranged her own sham marriage and then went on to make 
arrangements to facilitate the marriages of friends and relatives.’

But Miss Nicholls said ‘the edifice of
these marriages came tumbling down’ following the sham wedding of Nolan
to Tuan Hoang Lu in October 2010.

Mother-of-one Nolan, a regular at one
of the nail bars, had confided in Luu about her financial problems. She
was paid £5,000 to marry the Miss Nails employee at Blackburn Register 
Office. Wallace was a witness.

CCTV footage obtained by police showed several Chinese guests behaving ‘appropriately’ at the reception at a country club.

But Nolan and her co-defendants were 
heavily under the influence of alcohol and treated the occasion as ‘a 
joke and a farce’. And later Mr Doyle told police that the scam had paid
for the holiday in Mexico.

Nolan was arrested in February 2011 
and later that month police raided Luu’s home in Preston and found 
documents that were ‘stock in trade’ for bogus weddings including 
passports, birth certificates and wedding photographs.

Donnelly, 34, entered a sham marriage 
with Luu in October 2008 at Blackburn Register Office, which was 
witnessed by Nelson. He was said to have received £1,500.

Proctor, 40, was paid around £2,000 to
enter into a sham marriage to Vietnamese nail bar worker Le Thi Le 
Quyen at the register office in May 2010.

He claimed in court that it 
was a genuine love match. Donnelly was paid £500 as a witness. Nolan, of
Blackburn, and Donnelly, of Oswaldtwistle, pleaded guilty to taking 
part in sham marriages.

Donnelly also admitted to being a witness at a 
fake ceremony, as did Wallace, 22, and Nelson, 28, both of Blackburn.

Proctor, of Blackburn, denied entering
into a sham marriage, but was convicted after a trial. All will be 
sentenced later this month.
