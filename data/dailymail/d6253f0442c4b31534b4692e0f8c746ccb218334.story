Luis Suarez looked like a man determined to settle a score at the Etihad.

The former Liverpool striker struck a first-half brace on his return to England to guide Barcelona to a 2-1 win at the Etihad Stadium in the Champions League last 16 first-leg.

Perhaps Suarez was fired up after reading a feature in the Manchester City match programme on Tuesday, which labelled the Uruguayan Barcelona's 'dogsbody' Â and someone 'who does the donkey work.'

The piece in the City programme acknowledged the sublime Barcelona attack that was visiting the Etihad but couldn't resist mocking Suarez, who is less of a central figure at the Nou Camp with stars Lionel Messi and Neymar leading the attack.

'It's a measure of the task facing City's defence tonight that Luis Suarez is the one who does the donkey work in Barcelona's front three,' said the piece.

'He is very much the dogsbody in this trio of artful dodgers,' continued the feature in reference to Messi and Neymar's apparent superiority.

However at full-time at the Etihad, Suarez could certainly reflect on a highly successful evening of donkey work. What a way to bite back.
