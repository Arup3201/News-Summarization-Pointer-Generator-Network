Raw milk used on skin and body as a cosmetic use could trigger serious health problems, an expert has warned.

It comes after the Victorian Government announced tough new laws, forcing dairy farmers to turn raw milk unpalatable or treat it safe for human consumption from January 1.

Unpasteurised cow's milk has been banned in Australia for more than 70 years but manufacturers can sell it as a cosmetic product rather than food. 

But UNSW's Associate Professor of Food and Microbiology Julian Cox told The Sunday Telegraph that the sale of organic bath milk at selected retail stores was to avoid the ban.

Raw milk used on skin and body as a cosmetic use could trigger serious health problems, expert has warned

Following the death of a toddler and four other children who fell seriously ill after it's believed they consumed raw milk, Cox said cows could pass on mastitis or 'milk fever' during the milking process.

'In mastitis, bacteria can be present at very high levels in raw milk,' Associate Professor Cox said.

'Pseudomonas aeruginosa is well known to cause problems with wounds and burns, high levels could be a problem even with topical or cosmetic use — without consumption.'

Following the regulations, raw milk producers who breach the new rules will be slapped with hefty fines of $17,700 and could lose their license to produce dairy products, the Herald Sun reports.

Victorian Minister for Consumer Affairs Jane Garrett said the changes will help protect consumers from the serious risks of drinking raw unpasteurised milk. 

'Unfortunately we have seen some young children become severely ill through the consumption or raw milk and it has been linked to the tragic death of a young child,' she said.

'The packaging and sale of raw milk as a cosmetic bath product is causing some confusion among consumers.

'Raw milk may be sold for cosmetic use as 'bath' milk and can appear similar to other milk products, but it must carry warning labels.'

Regulators are considering whether raw milk labels mislead consumers, with the product often sold alongside consumable milk products.

Chief health officer Dr Rosemary Lester said some people were choosing to drink raw milk because they believed it was healthier than pasteurised milk.

The raw milk is often sold in fridges near to the pasteurised drinking milk and its packaging looks similar to that of regular milk.

There has been a resurgence in people wanting to drink raw milk as part of a belief that raw and unprocessed food is healthier.

They claim it is more nutritious, easier to digest and contains probiotics - and that it's better for cows and farms.

However, Dr Lester warned that raw milk can affect the kidneys and the bloodstream and cause watery diarrhoea. 

In addition 'only a small number of these pathogens are needed to cause illness,' Dr Lester said.

She said unpasteurised milk could make anyone sick but risks were greatest for young children and elderly, pregnant or otherwise unhealthy people.

'Since the 1940s, it has been compulsory to pasteurise cow's milk in Australia,' Dr Lester said.

'Milk is heated for a very short period of time, effectively destroying any disease-causing bacteria which may be present in raw milk.'
