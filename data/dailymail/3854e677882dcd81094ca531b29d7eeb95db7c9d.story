Sitting opposite me, her tight sweater hugging her chest, her skirt barely skimming slender thighs, was the woman I had idolised as a teenager - and ever since.

It's not often, when you've been in the interviewing business as long as I have, that you experience the flutter of nerves that once beset you in the early days.

But my guest on the radio the other day was Cher, undoubtedly one of the most famous women in the world - indeed the only recording artist to have had a number one hit in every one of the six decades since she began her long music career with Sonny in the mid-Sixties.

'She's one of us': Jenni with her teenage idol Cher earlier this month

She's also known for being tough and outspoken and not suffering fools gladly and, as it's my job to ask the difficult questions, there were plenty of sticky subjects to approach which could have led to disastrous silences during Woman's Hour.

There's the two kids and two husbands who had an unhealthy relationship with drugs, the daughter who became a son, and the rumours that she's spent half her life under the plastic surgeon's scalpel.

My first thought when I woke up that day was: what if she's horrible? It would have shattered all the affection for her which began in 1965 when Sonny and Cher burst on the British music scene with I Got You Babe.

I was 15, she was 19 and everything I wanted to be. She was beautiful with cheekbones to die for.

Her voice was deep and powerful. Her hair hung around her face in the 'curtains' my mother had banned, and her clothes were loose and comfortable - totally on trend - but considered sloppy and messy by the American audience who never took to her as quickly as the British did.

(When we met, she confided that those clothes were made for her by a dressmaker friend, and that they were all she could afford at the time.)

On the day, she arrived at Broadcasting House to a barrage of paparazzi, and surrounded by the kind of entourage that accompanies any major star. I counted at least nine people dancing attendance and providing for her every need.

Superstar: Cher at her most outrageous

She carried no handbag, suggesting one of them was responsible for carrying her money - and a packet of tissues. She says she never gets sick, but had picked up the cold that's going around.

'That's Britain for you,' she said with a grin and coughed heartily. Would she splutter through our interview? Thankfully not, after one of her minions handed her a plastic beaker with a straw containing some secret concoction.

She is not a classically beautiful woman, but she is stunningly attractive. She's tall and fabulously slim and toned. She wore a leather jacket, which she removed at my request on account of the creaking every time she gesticulated. Not a good sound on the radio.

Underneath, she had on what she described as her Union Jack sweater, seriously tight. Her skirt - an extended belt as my mother would have described it - and low-heeled black leather boots almost met at the hem. In other words, precisely the kind of thing she would have worn in the Sixties.

Her hair is long and dyed black with a hint of bouncy curl, and her skin is flawless. I studied it carefully and, while it's obvious there's been work done, she doesn't have the tight, motionless features of one who's indulged in excessive plastic surgery.

We talked first about those early days and the reason for her separation from Sonny. While she acknowledged he was pivotal in guiding her career, she told me that she found his need to control her and play the older, wiser partner suffocating.

They were together for 12 years, but then she broke away, craving independence. I suspect that since that day, no one has been able to tell Cher what to do or how to behave.

And I shouldn't have worried that she would duck the controversial questions.

Why had she been critical of Miley Cyrus and her 'twerking' performance with the singer Robin Thicke, I asked? Wasn't it a bit rich coming from someone who'd unashamedly used shock tactics to engage her audience? She'd stunned America by baring her navel in the Seventies.

She was apologetic, saying she'd kind of jumped on a bandwagon of criticism of Cyrus. She didn't blame her for knowing her own audience. She did, though, hold to her critique of the performance. It was, she smiled, simply bad and that's unforgivable.

So, what about the plastic surgery? How much had she really had?

First of all, she denied that there'd been any re-contouring of her body. She'd worked hard at it, she said, by keeping fit, slim and toned: it was all through her own physical effort with no surgical assistance.

She had, though, begun to worry about her ageing face in her 40s. When she was cast in romantic roles opposite actors such as Nicolas Cage in Moonstruck - for which she won a Best Actress Oscar - she was very aware that he was in his 20s and the difference was glaringly apparent.

She had a bit of bone shaved from her nose to give it a neater profile and had a nip and tuck.

I suspected augmentation of the lips. There seemed to be a hint of a trout pout, though she denied it, saying she had no truck with anything that scared her. She had never had fillers or Botox, she said, and hated the idea of young people - who had nothing to fill - messing about with treatments she didn't think she could trust.

She was open and confident about the work she had done, denying that she continued to feel pressure to look young. She claimed not to have any intention to go any further with surgery and insisted that what she had done had been entirely her choice and she had no regrets.

She, at 67, has four years on me and there's no doubt she looks a good 30 years younger. It didn't make me like or admire her any less to know that she has cheated a bit.

I would never go down that road, but then radio's a very forgiving medium for an older woman. Maybe if, like her, I'd relied on my face and my figure to earn a crust I might have been tempted to make a different decision. Sad, but seemingly unavoidable in our youth-obsessed culture.

It was when we talked about her children that the emotion really surfaced. It had, she reckoned, been hell for them to be raised in the full glare of the publicity of being Cher's kids. She'd supported them through drug rehab, but had found her daughter Chastity's gender reassignment from female to male - he's now known as Chas - incredibly painful.

She said she had called Chas soon after his surgery and heard his female voice on the phone. He'd forgotten to alter it and use a lower tone, and she asked him to leave it a little longer, a way of keeping in touch with the daughter she'd known.

She says she's now completely happy with her son's decision because it has made him happy - which is all any mother wants.

So what was it like to meet the woman I idolised as a girl?

She was warm, passionate, kind and occasionally funny. And her voice is undiminished in its power. And I've never seen so many people finding spurious reasons to pop into the studio for a peek.

Our conclusion? 'She's great. She's one of us. Just richer!' And with a very tight sweater.
