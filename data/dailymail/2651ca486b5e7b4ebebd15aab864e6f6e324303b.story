Amir Khan is to do battle with Floyd Mayweather in the richest fight ever to involve a British boxer.

Bolton’s former Olympic hero will meet the greatest pound-for-pound fighter in the world in Las Vegas on May 3.

Khan’s share of this $200million blockbuster is expected to be no less than $6m and is likely to climb to at least double that from pay-TV sales on both sides of the Atlantic.

Breathe it in: Amir Khan posted this Instagram picture on Wednesday night showing him taking in 95 per cent oxygen from a mask when recovering from training. The mask produced five times as much oxygen as breathing normal air. Just sitting in the oxygen chamber produces 41 per cent oxygen. 

The official announcement will be made
 in the next few days and Khan has already pulled out of his  challenge 
to world welterweight champion Devon Alexander, scheduled for December 7
 in New York, to ensure that his dream fight with Mayweather is not 
jeopardised.

Khan is being 
given this opportunity of a lifetime thanks to a conviction in America 
that his exceptional speed will present a unique test to Mayweather, who
 has dealt imperiously with all threats from bigger and supposedly 
stronger foes.

Stephen 
Espinosa, head of sports for the giant Showtime cable TV network which 
bankrolls both men, says: ‘Floyd has seen off the tough, heavy 
punchers. It remains to be seen what he will do against extreme speed 
and I like the Khan fight very much.’

Khan
 had already begun preparing in California to face Alexander and will 
remain almost permanently in camp there with his new trainer Virgil 
Hunter for the next seven months.

Mayweather
 had expressed interest in fighting at Wembley but reliable sources in 
America confirm that prospect has been discounted on financial grounds.

Not
 only would an early-afternoon timing in the US compromise pay-per-view 
takings there but even a live gate of 70,000 at the stadium would 
generate revenue of no more than £7million. There are also significant 
tax benefits from boxing in Nevada.

Reaching out: Mayweather lands a punch against Alvarez as he extended his unbeaten record

On the defensive: Khan was unconvincing in his victory over Diaz but has the fight he wanted

Mayweather’s
 master-class victory over Canelo Alvarez broke the $20m (£12.5m) barrier for ticket sales at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in 
Vegas, while Showtime pay-per-view subscriptions reached $157m… and rising.

Khan’s
 chance comes even though, as a two-time world light-welterweight 
champion, he lost his belts in successive bouts with Lamont Peterson and
 Danny Garcia.

Even though 
he has redeemed himself with comeback victories over Carlos Molina and 
another former world champion, Julio Diaz, he will be viewed in some 
quarters as jumping the queue to board the Mayweather money train.

However,
 the ring’s newest mantra is ‘speed kills’ and Golden Boy, the promoters
 of both men, will be using that special asset of Khan’s as a 
foundation of the massive marketing campaign to come.

That
 will include a TV documentary series, with the episodes focusing on 
Khan providing an exotic and fascinating insight into the life and times
 of the world’s pre-eminent, newly-wed Asian boxer.

There will also be a multi-city promotional tour in the new year, which will bring Mayweather to Britain.

Initial
 public reaction is likely to be that Khan has little chance against the
 the superlative ring craftsman of his generation and he will enter the
 betting as a heavy underdog.

Those
 odds are likely to shorten, however, as boxing weighs up all the 
factors surrounding the most extraordinary evening of Khan’s existence.

While Mayweather 
is nothing short of being a genius in the ring he struggled in the early
 rounds against the speed of Zab Judah – who Khan KO’d in six -  before
 securing a points victory.

Nor is he a one-punch knockout artist like the two men to have stopped Khan, namely Garcia and Breidis Prescott.

Mayweather
 is more a cumulative puncher and when he stopped Ricky Hatton six years
 ago the concussive effect was compounded by Manchester’s Hitman 
striking his head against a corner post as he went down.

Then
 there is the age factor.  Khan, who will be 27 in December, is 10 
years younger than Mayweather, who has announced that he is in the 
final stages of his career.

This
 will be the third in his series of six fights with Showtime on a 
contract expected to net him more than $200m. He has banked $41.5m from his virtuoso performance against Canelo, with more to come
 when figures are in for overseas TV and merchandising revenue.

It
 is unclear whether he will box on beyond the end of that contract in 
the autumn of 2015. That decision is likely to depend on whether he 
shows signs of slowing down. Older boxers can hit the age barrier at any
 moment, virtually without notice.

While
 that is unlikely to afflict Mayweather as early next May, the interim 
does give Khan the time to be in the most potent condition of his life.

Challenge: But Khan has been told to up his dedication to 100 per cent to reach Mayweather's level

Khan has promised Hunter that he will eschew his celebrity lifestyle of 
late, after his trainer warned that nothing less will do from now on than Mayweather’s exemplary, rigorous commitment to ‘hard work and 
dedication.’

He will have to
 remain grounded through the star-spangled hype which will precede this 
happening of immense sporting magnitude, complete with its chat show 
appearances on network television.

And
 where Alvarez whipped up the support and hard cash of tens of millions 
of his Mexican fans, Khan will be expected to excite massive interest in
 Asian communities in America, Britain, the Middle East and across the 
world.

No matter how wary 
the British reservations may be about his chances of dethroning the 
great Mayweather, there is certain to be a trans-Atlantic invasion of 
Las Vegas next spring.

Invasion: Las Vegas was taken over when 30,000 Brits travelled to see Ricky Hatton take on Mayweather

While
 the number of supporters following Khan may not reach the 30,000 who 
made the pilgrimage for Hatton’s tilt at Mayweather in 2007, the British
 interest seems certain to push the MGM gate revenue record for boxing 
in Nevada even higher.

And, 
in one crucial sense, the belief that Mayweather is omnipotent works 
heavily in favour of our highest profile ambassador for Anglo-Moslem 
relations.

Khan is totally convinced that his speed and skills can overcome Mayweather.

Even if he fails in that ambitious bid for ultimate ring glory, no-one will think any the worse of him.

And
 if he were to lose heroically in a terrific fight he will enjoy 
enormous exposure and acclaim around the world – with his market value 
for future world title challenges as significantly enhanced as his 
experience of the mega-occasion.

This, for Khan, this, is a  no-lose situation.
