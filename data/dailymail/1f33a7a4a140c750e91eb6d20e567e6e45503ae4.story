Victor Valdes trained with Manchester United's first team at Carrington on Friday and could complete a shock move to Old Trafford within two weeks. 

The legendary former Barcelona keeper, who is a free agent, is in talks with United boss Louis van Gaal. He was in gym, talking and working with United physios on Friday

Valdes' agent Gines Carvajal and another representative have met with the United hierarchy, with Van Gaal looking to wrap up a deal in the next fortnight.

The 32-year-old's knee injury is currently being assessed by United staff before Valdes completes the move.

He was originally on the verge of a deal with United's north-west rivals Liverpool, but had a pick of clubs including Bayern Munich before choosing a move to Old Trafford.

With Anders Lindegaard not inspiring Van Gaal's confidence, the Dutch boss has been on the lookout for a second-choice keeper.

It is felt Valdes' experience would make him an excellent deputy for No 1 David de Gea.

United's players were told the club were taking a look at Valdes and have been pleased to have him train with the squad this week.

Meanwhile, Michael Carrick will continue his recovery from ankle ligament damage on Friday. The 33-year-old has been out since July but is due to play for United's Under 21s against West Ham United at Rush Green.

The England midfielder was an unused substitute for Monday night's 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion and is expected to be part of the squad to face Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday.

The time for recovery between games means he will likely take his place on the bench once again rather than figure from the start against Jose Mourinho's title chasers.

United striker Robin van Persie is anticipating an edgy contest between the two rivals.

The Dutchman, who has come under criticism for his lackluster performances of late, said: 'Chelsea have a very good team and we have a good team. 

'But it's always a bit more edgy and I like that. You can sense that as well with the fans because they are a bit more on top of it in games like this. So in every way it's a game to look forward to.

'There's always a bit of a different feeling but it's not that we're less concentrated for other games but there's a bit extra tension in a good way. You don't really know what's going to happen before the game because it can go both ways.'
