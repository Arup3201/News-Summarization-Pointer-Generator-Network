Killed: Zara Shahid Hussain was shot outside her home

Former cricketer Imran Khan has condemned the killing of a senior member of his political party and laid the blame with the leader of rival party the Muttahida Quami Movement.

He also blamed the British government for the death of Zara Shahid Hussain outside her home in the upmarket Defence area of Karachi, Pakistan, as MQM leader Altaf Hussain runs his party from exile in England.

Ms Hussain, 60, was shot by two gunmen on Saturday in the family neighbourhood of assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto, police said. She was senior vice-president of Mr Khan's Movement for Justice party (PTI).

As her funeral was held today, a bomb in Bannu in the north of the country exploded, injuring at least six children.

In a statement, Mr Khan said: 'Her death has sent shockwaves across the rank and file of the party.'

He also wrote a series of tweets, saying: 'I am shocked and deeply saddened by the brutal killing of Zara Shahid Hussain, Zara apa to us, in Karachi tonite. A targeted act of terror!

'I hold Altaf Hussain 
directly responsible for the murder as he openly threatened PTI workers 
and leaders through public broadcasts.

'I also hold the British (government) 
responsible as I had warned them about (British) citizen Altaf Hussain 
after his open threats.'

MQM has denied any involvement in the killing and said it was likely to be a robbery gone wrong. It demanded a retraction from Mr Khan.

Altaf Hussain is accused of murder in 
Pakistan and leads his party remotely from exile in England. His party 
is designated a terrorist organization by Canada, a charge it strongly 
denies.

Politician: Ms Hussain was the senior vice-president of Imran Khan's PTI party

Recently, he gave a speech which was seen as an incitement to attack political rivals. 
British police are investigating whether or not it constituted a hate 
speech.

National elections last Saturday handed a 
landslide victory to opposition leader Nawaz Sharif and his Pakistan 
Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).

But results from a handful of 
constituencies across the country - including in Karachi - are still uncertain amid accusations 
of vote-rigging.

Some areas are repolling today after security issues prevented voting last week.

Last week's election gave the MQM 18 of 
19 national assembly seats in Karachi. The constituency where today's 
repoll is taking place, known as NA-250, is thought to be a 
stronghold of the PTI.

Whatever the result Mr Sharif's national win is guaranteed, but as Pakistan's financial centre, Karachi 
generates around half of government revenues and stability in the city 
is key to stability of the whole country.

At least 150 people are believed to have
died during the election campaign. Today a toy bomb left in the street 
injured at least six children when it exploded in their hands.

The MQM, a secular party, is locked in a
battle with various rival contenders for influence in Karachi, 
including Pakistan's Taliban movement, which has sought to gain a 
foothold in various districts on the outskirts of the city in recent 
years.

Khan's election campaign electrified many Pakistanis, pushing the PTI from a marginal party to Pakistan's third largest.

Karachi is home to 18 million people. It typically sees about a dozen 
murders a day, a combination of political killings, attacks by the 
Pakistan Taliban and sectarian militant groups, and street crime.
