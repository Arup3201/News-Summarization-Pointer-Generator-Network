A spokesperson from the UK gift experience company said: 'Our study showed that our Christmases have been "hampered" in recent years, and that we’ve had to really tighten the purse strings.

'It’s clear that the UK is in need of some serious luxurious this holiday season, and we have taken it to the absolute extreme and created what is potentially the world’s most Christmas hamper.

'Whether or not people will buy this remains to be seen, but one thing is for certain: we can deliver some serious indulgence this year if they want it.'

This isn’t the first time a money-no-object gift has been advertised ahead of the festive season.

VeryFirstTo.com, which dubs itself 'the first website for individuals to learn about, and have, newly launching luxury products and experiences’, also offers a range of over-the-top gifts.

Last year, an eye-catching 24-carat gold egg worth £4,500 was on sale.
