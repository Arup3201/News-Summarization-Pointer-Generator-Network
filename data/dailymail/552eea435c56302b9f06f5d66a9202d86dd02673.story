A middle-aged woman claimed cash benefits for two male relatives, both of whom were dead, a jury heard today.

Janet Parlour did not reveal either man’s death when claiming the money and managed to accrue almost £20,000 pounds illegally, according to the prosecution.

Today the 62-year-old woman faced charges of fraud and failure to disclose information in relation to the two dead men - one of whom was her father and the other her cousin.

Reading Crown Court where Janet Parlour's trial is being heard by Mr Recorder Laurence West QC

Parlour continued to receive her cousin’s housing benefit and her father’s pension even after the former moved out and then after both men had died, the jury heard.

She also did not tell her local council of her cousin Alan Roberts’ departure or his death, it was claimed.

Nor did she inform the Department for Work and Pensions that her father, Charles Summers, had died. Instead she contacted them to insist he had not died and that his pension should continue.

Giles Atkinson, prosecuting at Reading Crown Court, told the seven men and five women on the jury: 'What we say in this case is that the defendant, Mrs Parlour, has both given false information and also failed to give information and in both respects we say she did that in order to receive or to continue to receive the benefit that should not have been coming to her.

'We also say that in doing that, she was dishonest.'

He added: 'An important point is that both of the people who were entitled to the benefit are now dead.'

He said on the forms filled in by Mr Roberts and Mrs Parlour when he first moved into the home she shared with husband John, in 2005, both falsely stated that they were not related to each other.

After being assessed she began to receive payments from West Berkshire Council direct to her bank account for £75 pounds per week, to cover his rent.

When he then moved out of her home, in Calcot, Berkshire, she did not tell the council and continued to receive the money.

Even after he died, on March 25, 2009, she still did not let on.

Mr Atkinson said: 'The second person is the defendant’s father, Charles Summers, and it was to him the pension was due.

'Both sets were paid directly to the defendant. In the case of Mr Roberts it was because she was acting as his landlady. In the case of Mr Summers it was because she was acting as an appointee, handling his affairs.

'The DWP was initially informed about the death of Mr Summers but then there was a phone call from someone calling themselves Janet Parlour, the daughter of Mr Summers, in effect retracting the statement, that the circumstances had changed, and that the pension should continue.'

Mr Summers had passed away on February 2, 2009.

Karen Coggs, the then manager of the Salvation Army Centre in Reading, said Mr Roberts had been a client there and had given his previous address as Willow Tree Glade.

They got him to apply for housing benefit to cover his time with them and it was a routine audit some time later by West Berkshire and Reading Councils that exposed the duplicate applications.

It was during the same audit that investigators realised Mr Roberts had actually died.

Mrs Coggs, appearing in the witness box at Reading Crown Court, admitted under cross-examination by defence counsel Nigel Daly that she did not know of Janet Parlour’s existence at the time.

She also acknowledged she could not see how Parlour would have known that Mr Roberts was living at the hostel.

Parlour denies fraud by dishonestly furnishing a document, by failing to give prompt notification of a change of circumstances, and three further counts by failing to disclose information.

When interviewed by investigators from West Berkshire Council, Parlour told them she had had “a bit of a nervous breakdown” because of her father dying.

As a result she had left her job with Cleaning Logistics of Twyford, Berkshire.

She also told them that her cousin, Alan Roberts, had come to live with her because he had been deported from America.

Describing him as “an alcoholic” and “a nomad”, she said she would never know where he was and that sometimes he would come back and leave the house in a mess.

“He was family”, she explained as her reason for putting him up.

When the council uncovered the over-payments she told them she had tried to contact them on a number of occasions to let them know about Mr Roberts’ death but that she had never received a reply.

So she put all of the housing benefit income into an old account held in her son’s name, she said, and did not touch it.

Karen Greenaway, principal investigator in the case, said the total overpaid in housing benefit was £13,800 pounds.

She told the court that when the situation with Charles Summers was revealed, Parlour flatly denied continuing to receive his pension payments.

She also said it had not been her who called the DWP to request that the payments continue, even after her father’s death had been registered.

The trial, before Mr Recorder Laurence West QC, continues.
