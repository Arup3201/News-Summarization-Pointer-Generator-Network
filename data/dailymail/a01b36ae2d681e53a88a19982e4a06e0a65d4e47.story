One misplaced step brought her hopes of gold crashing down.

Zara Phillips and her horse High Kingdom clipped a fence in the equestrian eventing final yesterday.

In that split second, the Queen’s granddaughter and her teammates narrowly lost out on the first British gold of the London Olympics.

After an otherwise outstanding performance, the team took silver. But Zara’s delight was tinged with disappointment, and when husband Mike Tindall rushed to comfort her, she buried her face in his shoulder.

As the pole fell, there were gasps of horror from the royal spectators, including the Duchess of Cambridge and Princes William and Harry.

They knew Zara needed to put on a perfect show-jumping performance to take gold from the Germans. William and Kate were seen clapping their hands to their mouths in horror when the pole dropped to the floor, costing the team the crucial points.

Tindall immediately rushed backstage to the paddock to meet his wife.

Afterwards, Zara, 31, said: ‘I made a 
mistake. He [High Kingdom] put a foot down... it was my fault. It 
punished me and us. Obviously, I’m disappointed.’

But
 over the three-day event, the performance by Zara – an Olympic debutant
 on an inexperienced horse – far surpassed anyone’s expectations.

She
 finished as the third-strongest member of the equestrian team, ranked 
eighth overall and beating the scores of world No 1 William Fox-Pitt 
and  teammate Nicola Wilson.

And
 although her impressive performance wasn’t quite enough for gold, it 
was crucial in securing a well-deserved silver medal for the team.

When
 the result was finally announced, the royals – in their own way – went 
wild, with Kate raising her fists in the air and leading the family in 
delighted cheers.

A smiling 
Princess Anne said: ‘She did very well.’ Her husband Tim Laurence added:
 ‘We’re very proud. It’s a fantastic silver medal.’

In
 a poignant moment, it fell to Anne to present her daughter with the 
Olympic medal she never managed to win herself.

After carefully placing 
the medal around Zara’s neck, the Princess Royal pulled her beaming 
daughter close for a kiss on each cheek, as Zara appeared to mouth: ‘Oh,
 Mum.’

Afterwards, Zara 
joked to reporters: ‘Whatever you do, don’t ask me what  it was like to 
have my mother present me with the medal. Obviously, it  was amazing.’

And
 when asked if she was glad to see her cousins in the stands, Zara 
replied: ‘Yes, it’s nice that they’ve managed to come and watch.’

Despite the rain, the royal cohort who turned out to support Zara appeared to enjoy every minute.

Kate
 began the day in a nautical blue and white striped top under a smart 
navy £500 Smythe blazer, with a red and gold Team GB badge attached.

But
 when the rain began, she pulled on a rather more casual Team GB zip-up 
tracksuit top, and Prince William added a bright red baseball cap to his
 outfit.

Kate, who sat between the princes, protected her hair from the rain with a black umbrella.

Later,
 Harry attempted to close it, prompting shrieks from Kate as drips fell 
on her – which William and Harry appeared to find most amusing.

Meanwhile
 Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, opted for practicality over glamour, 
pulling on a hooded waterproof when the rain started.

Princesses
 Beatrice and  Eugenie also made an appearance to cheer on Zara, 
alongside Zara’s brother Peter Phillips and his wife Autumn.

Even 
former Prime Minister John Major was spotted sitting in the stands.

Beatrice,
 who attended the cross-country event yesterday and the swimming finals 
last night, is proving a committed Olympics spectator, despite 
apparently having recently landed a ‘demanding’ job with a venture 
capital firm.

While there 
may have been a considerable royal presence, there was no doubt which 
particular royal the 20,000 spectators in the Greenwich Park arena had 
come to see.

Zara received 
deafening applause both before and after her events from spectators from
 home and abroad.

When asked what it felt like to have won the silver 
medal, a smiling Zara said: ‘It’s unreal. This
 time last year I wouldn’t have even thought I’d have been here.

'We had 
the greatest time. Yes we wanted gold, but we made mistakes, but when 
[the silver medal] got put round our necks, it was all worth it.’

Zara
 added that she was ‘really proud’ of her ten-year-old horse, who lost 
both his front shoes in the cross-country on Monday but still performed 
well enough to help her secure the medal.

And
 in a tribute to the  home crowd who sat in the rain to cheer her on, 
she added:  ‘It’s incredible, it gives you a massive lift as you come 
into the arena. We’re really grateful to everyone who has come.’

Monday
 was the first anniversary of her wedding to rugby player Tindall – but 
when asked if she had a chance to celebrate, she laughed and said: ‘No!’

Zara was one of five members of the silver-medal-winning British equestrian team.

By
 competing in the Olympics, she follows in the footsteps of her Olympian
 parents. The Princess Royal competed in the 1976 Games in Montreal, and
 Captain Mark Phillips won a team gold in Munich in 1972 and a silver in
 1988.
