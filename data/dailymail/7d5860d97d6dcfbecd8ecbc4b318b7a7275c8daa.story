Jason Palmer tells a fun story about the day earlier this year when he took his extraordinary brand of golf to a tournament in Germany and a spectator felt compelled to confront him. It was the sort of conversation many on-lookers have considered but not entered.

Palmer had just missed the 18th green in the second-tier event, which would once have meant a neurotic panic for a man whose problems with chipping moved him to tears in the past.

Worse than that, the thought of taking those delicate little shots used to make him want to quit the game altogether.

Jason Palmer is nicknamed the 'One-Armed Bandit' by the European Tour for playing chip shots one handed

But those were the days before he devised the unique technique that made the German chap take notice.

The man the European Tour calls the 'One-Armed Bandit' put a single hand on his club and took a little swing.

'I was chipping one-handed and it was actually one of the rare times these days when I messed it up,' he says.

'I had a bad lie and it was a hard shot. But this German guy has seen me playing with one hand and obviously thought I was messing around or joking or something.

'I was walking off the green and he actually confronted me and asked, 'Is this for real?' and motioned one-handed.

'In golf, walking up and criticising a pro's technique just doesn't really happen.

'I guess he was a bit taken aback by it. But believe me, if I was playing two-handed the shot would have probably been worse and certainly I would not be out there.'

These days, 'out there' means the European Tour. Palmer recently won full playing privileges to play on the big stage, a charming and unconventional triumph for a 30-year-old from Leicester who was an England international in his early twenties as an amateur and a 'quivering wreck' with the yips a couple of years later.

Now, whenever he finds himself within 40 yards of the pin but off the green, he will pitch or chip one-handed, be it from a bunker, rough or fairway.

Many golfers have their kinks, but none quite like this. He is the first player in the Tour's history to play in such a way.

The titters and sniggers have followed him for four years since his 'eureka moment'.

But as Palmer, who turned professional in 2009, says, 'people can laugh yet this is a results business and this has saved me'.

The cruel irony is that as a young international with two hands on the club, his short game was his strong point.

'I was a late starter and only picked up a club for the first time at 14,' he says. 'Within a year my handicap went from 26 to 15 and then in another year it went to five.

'I was improving so fast. My short game was definitely the best bit. I was such a weedy kid I could do nothing off the tee but my chipping and pitching was so precise.

'When I first got in the England squad, in 2007, it was my forte. Then, possibly because I put so much attention on my long game, it all went horribly, horribly wrong.

Before he had the yips, Palmer's short game was his strongest attribute as a young golfer

'It would start with one duffed chip. And then another. Before long it was getting in my head. Golf is one of those games you play best with a clear head and here I was thinking about technique.

'The more I thought the worse it got. In time, I had the yips — I was practically terrified every time I missed the green because I knew I'd mess up the chip. I remember going to Australia with the England squad. I was two or three under par and missed a green.

'What followed was like watching a tennis match with me going hitting through the green, walking across and then hitting it back through to the other side.

'I just could not get it to stop and ended up with eight or nine for the hole. I can also remember the club championships here (at Kirby Muxloe Golf Club) in 2008. I was cruising with a three-shot lead with five to play.

'I had a 350-yard hole, my drive left me 70 and then I hit two yards with my wedge. That's annoying. Then I did the same again. I barely dragged myself over the line.

'When I'd go away with the England squad, I'd have to do these skills competitions against brilliant players who are excellent professionals now like Chris Wood.

'He would knock them stiff from 70 yards and I'd miss the green. They were dark days.

'In 2009, I was so low. I was upstairs at home and tears were welling in my eyes.

'I was saying to my dad, 'I can't do this anymore'. We quite often didn't see eye to eye because he pushed me so hard but he put his arm around my shoulder and said, 'I do believe you can do it. Don't give up'.'

A year later, at a tournament in Spain, frustration finally got the better of him.

He approached a chip shot he simply felt unable to play and instead hit it one-handed. It went within an inch of the hole. 'I was playing a week later on the Alps Tour in Austria,' he says, 'and was having a pitching contest with my friend, Neil Chaudhuri, and I was doing it one-handed.

'I was going over all my problems with him and saying how I could do it just fine one-handed. It was a bit of a eureka moment — he just said, "This is a results game. If one-handed works for you, who cares if you feel stupid doing it." The next few weeks I played the golf of my life.'

By the start of this year, Palmer had reached the Challenge Tour. More than £85,000 in winnings and a tournament victory has landed him on the European Tour.

'People give me some double-takes,' he says. 'You get some strange looks and there was that German guy. I guess it does look crazy.

'But would I be playing on the European Tour with two hands on the club? No chance. People can laugh if they want but I'm pinching myself.'
