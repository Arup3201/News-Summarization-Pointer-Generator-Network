Home Secretary Theresa May faces questions from MPs over accusations that politicians, the police and even her own officials have suppressed allegations against powerful individuals for decades

Extraordinary new claims pointing to an Establishment cover-up of child sex abuse by senior politicians emerged last night.

Home Secretary Theresa May faces questions from MPs over accusations that politicians, the police and even her own officials have suppressed allegations against powerful individuals for decades.

Some 114 files ‘potentially relevant’ to child abuse are now known to have been lost or destroyed by the Home Office.

And, incredibly, at least four specific allegations relating to child abuse in Home Office files were not passed to police for up to 35 years, officials have now admitted. The claims have only been handed over in the past 12 months.

In an explosive intervention, former Tory Cabinet Minister Norman Tebbit said the evidence suggested there ‘may well have been’ an Establishment cover-up, beginning in the 1970s and 1980s and continuing to this day.

‘At that time I think most people would have thought that the Establishment, the system, was to be protected, and if a few things had gone wrong here and there, that it was more important to protect the system than to delve too far into it,’ Lord Tebbit said. The peer, who served in the Cabinet in the early 1980s, added: ‘That view, I think, was wrong then and it has been spectacularly shown to be wrong now because the abuses have grown.’

His intervention fuelled growing demands for a full Hillsborough-style public inquiry into a series of toxic allegations, including claims of abuse by the late Liberal MP Sir Cyril Smith and allegations of paedophile activity at parties attended by politicians and other prominent figures at the Elm Guest House in Barnes, south west London.

Mrs May – who yesterday remained silent on the scandal engulfing her department – will face a storm of criticism from MPs as she gives a statement in the Commons today.

In other developments it emerged that former Tory home secretary Lord Brittan has been questioned by police over an historical allegation of raping a woman and a Labour peer is under investigation after 12 men made allegations of ‘horrific’ child abuse dating back decades.

Police have also traced a child at the centre of the alleged Westminster paedophile ring. The unnamed businessman, in his 40s and based in the US, claims he was abused by a politician when he was eight.

Mrs May will announce details of a 
fresh review of her department’s handling of the affair by a leading QC,
 but pressure for a public inquiry continued to grow, with 141 MPs from 
all parties backing the call.

Labour
 MP Tom Watson has launched a petition calling on the Prime Minister to 
‘make amends for historic failures’ by establishing a national inquiry 
into allegations of organised child sex abuse.

He said that ‘many survivors of child abuse believe they have been let down by the system of child protection in the UK’.

The petition has already been signed by thousands of members of the public. Mr Watson said: ‘Thousands had nowhere to turn. Nobody listened and nobody helped.’ The Home Office launched a review last year to discover what had happened to a dossier of alleged paedophile activity handed to Lord Brittan by the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983.

In a statement last week, Lord Brittan insisted that it had been handled appropriately and that he had asked officials to investigate the claims fully.

But a public letter written by the Home Office’s top civil servant Mark Sedwill at the weekend revealed that the review found dozens of files were missing.

Of the 573 files recovered, 13 contained
 ‘information about alleged child abuse’, including four involving Home 
Office officials. Incredibly, only nine of the files – dated between 
1979 and 1999 – were ever handed to police.

Keith Vaz, Labour chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said he was shocked by the loss of files, which he said was on ‘an industrial scale’.

Mr Vaz, who had opposed a public inquiry into the scandal, said he had changed his mind on the basis of the revelations. His committee will question Mr Sedwill tomorrow over the missing files.

Tory MP Zac Goldsmith said the case for a public inquiry was now irresistible. He said: ‘The Home Secretary is going to have to think again. It is inconceivable that those files were all lost by accident – no one is ever going to believe that, whatever the latest review comes up with. We need a proper inquiry. It is possible that some of the revelations will be very ugly for the political class. But we may need that cathartic experience to clear the air.’

Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who last week called on Lord Brittan to reveal what he knew, said it was a scandal that the Home Office had not passed files containing potentially serious allegations to the police immediately.

And he warned that senior figures in all three main political parties were still trying to prevent questions about past misdeeds by a small number of MPs and peers. He said Parliament may be on the verge of a ‘Savile-like scandal’.

The Home Office declined to comment yesterday but Downing Street insisted the case for an ‘over-arching’ public inquiry had not yet been made.

Alison Millar of the law firm Leigh Day, which is representing some of the alleged victims, said another internal Home Office review would not quell the growing public disquiet.

‘This cannot be another internal review held by those who may well be at fault,’ she said. ‘It will only fuel a growing suspicion amongst the electorate that there is a conspiracy over the abuse of children by those with great power.’

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper warned the ‘review of a review’ announced by the Government was insufficient.

In a letter to Mrs May she said: ‘Any stones left unturned will leave concerns of institutional malaise, or worse a cover-up, unaddressed.’

‘To be relevant, and effective, any independent inquiry needs to create a safe environment for survivors of abuse to come forward so their voices can be heard. At the moment the allegations are so serious and go so far up in the Government, to make many survivors fear for their safety.’

Campaigners are calling for a ‘Hillsborough-style’ inquiry into historic allegations of child sex abuse.

This would involve an independent board of experts similar to the panel that investigated the 1989 football disaster. 

Public inquiries have traditionally been led by one or more senior judges, as with the Saville Inquiry into the Bloody Sunday killings of 1972 and the Leveson Inquiry into press standards.

More rarely they have been conducted by a panel of veteran Whitehall mandarins – for example the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq War. 

But the Hillsborough Independent Panel, set up in 2010 to ensure the release of all documents related to the tragedy in which 96 Liverpool fans died, was praised for being different. 

It was chaired by the Bishop of Liverpool, the Right Reverend James Jones, and the nine members included former BBC journalist Peter Sissons, a retired deputy chief constable, an ex-deputy chief medical officer and archive experts.

Each brought specialist knowledge to the task of scrutinising more than 450,000 pages to uncover the truth about attempts to cover up police failings.
