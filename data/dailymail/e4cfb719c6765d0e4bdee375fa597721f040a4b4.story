It's the most exclusive guesthouse in America - the Washington guesthouse that only former Presidents and their partners can stay in.

The four-storey clubhouse opposite the White House which was built in the 1970s for former leader Lyndon B Johnson to stay in, has thrown open its doors for the first time.

Despite its famous guests, the accommodation in the brownstone property is relatively modest - and former first lady Barbara Bush once described it as a 'dump'. It has since undergone a complete refit.

President's club: The dining room with eight chairs around it in the clubhouse residence which is opposite the White House

Bathroom: A large bath and a fireplace in the main bathroom in the property which former Presidents have stayed in down the years

Throughout the property the Presidential Seal features prominently - and is embossed on the duvet cover of the large white double bed in one of the two bedrooms.

There is an impressive bathroom complete with a fireplace and a large office to work in.

The four living ex-Presidents - Jimmy Carter, George Bush Snr, Bill Clinton and George Bush Jnr - are the only men who are allowed to stay.

However, as there have been a series of relatively young Presidents in recent years the number of members of the very exclusive club is likely to grow.

Office: A desk and a bookcase full of volumes in the Presidential clubhouse. However, there is no computer

Club members: George W. Bush and Bill Clinton who are among the only four men eligible to stay in the four-storey Presidential clubhouse opposite the White House

Presidents: George Bush Snr frequently stayed in the clubhouse when Bill Clinton was President - but stayed in the White House when his son was in charge. Jimmy Carter, right, is the fourth member of the unique group

The smart formal dining room is almost as nice as the one in the White House just over the road.

A series of photographs and paintings adorn the walls throughout the spacious property - including a portrait of Thomas Jefferson in the dining room.

Although George Bush Snr frequently stayed in the clubhouse when Clinton was President, when his son was in charge he stayed in the White House.

The doors to the clubhouse were thrown open to CBS News for the first time as a new book is published.

Bedroom: A large double-bed with a duvet cover which is embossed with the Presidential seal of office

Sitting room: Two tables in the four-storey brownstone property which was refitted after former first lady Barbara Bush branded it a 'dump'

Michael Duffy, who has-co-authored The President's Club with Nancy Gibbs, told CBS: 'The reason this overnight guest house exists goes back to Dick Nixon. He keeps getting phone calls from Johnson in Texas who is restless in his ranch and he keeps wanting to come to Washington.

'That is why this here - it was Nixon trying to keep Lyndon Johnson happy.'

The author added that Presidents have formed some unlikely alliances with former holders of the office. For example, Bill Clinton received a lot of advice from Richard Nixon.

Mr Duffy added: 'Nixon really wanted to get to know Clinton. He wanted to 
be sort of a secret behind the scenes adviser. He became that. Clinton 
turned out to rely on him for a great deal of advice.'Â 

He said that the unique experiences Presidents had meant they were often able to form a close bond.

'You come out of this job with so many scars that only you know about there,' he said.

'There
are only a few people who understand what those scars are like and 
maybe a relationship with someone like that can take you to a place 
where no one else can.'

It's not quite the Oval office: A desk for a former President. Former leaders have formed some unlikely bonds with the current incumbents - including Bill Clinton who was close to Richard Nixon
