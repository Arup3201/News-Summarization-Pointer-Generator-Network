'Sheer hell': Natalie Creane suffered a 
traumatic brain injury when she was hit by a falling wardrobe panel in 
her Abu Dhabi hotel room. She is pictured here before the incident

A British woman celebrating her engagement in a five-star hotel in the United Arab Emirates suffered a traumatic brain injury after she was hit on the head by a block of wood only minutes into her stay.

Natalie Creane, 33, was knocked unconscious in her hotel room when a loose panel fell from her wardrobe and struck her on the forehead.

The freak incident left her in a coma five times and she now has a serious form of epilepsy, causing her to suffer violent seizures and sudden collapses.

Medics have had to put her into the induced comas to treat her injury, and have warned that she could die if she suffers another large seizure.

The human resources director's family are locked in a legal battle with the hotel's bosses, who they believe should accept liability for the incident and pay compensation.

They say the injury has transformed her from a fit and healthy young woman to someone who is unable to even bathe herself.

Mrs Creane, originally from Kelvedon Hatch, Essex, was injured in 2008 while she and her then fiance Trevor were staying at the luxury Emirates Palace hotel in Abu Dhabi.

The couple, who have since married, 
had moved to the UAE to start a new life and had booked a weekend at the
hotel to celebrate their engagement.

Mrs Creane has been treated in a Dubai hospital 40 times since the incident happened - including 20 stays in intensive care.

Mr Creane, 42, said: 'We are all terrified for Natalie. She is in such a state and has been through so much.

'She will need rehabilitation, treatment, potentially surgery, and we donâ€™t know if it will work or what the future holds.

'The doctors have warned us that she may not survive another large seizure.'

Mrs Creane's parents Derek and Angie 
Smith, of Kelvedon Hatch, said they were close to financial ruin because
the legal battle, which began in 2010, has proved so costly.

They
initially avoided drawing attention to their daughter's plight for fear
of compromising the legal process, but have now broken their silence.

Mrs Smith described the ordeal as 'sheer hell', adding: 'It is heart-rending to see what has happened to Natalie.

'We have kept quiet but now we are desperate and we have had to go public with what has been happening.'

Mr
Smith said: 'We are now even more terrified for her. She is very, very 
weak and finding it difficult to walk and adjust to the new medications.

'She was taken into hospital with a blood clot after being laid up for so long.'

The case is due to come to court later this month, and more than 9,000 supporters have joined a Facebook group campaigning for the hotel to pay compensation.

The Emirates Palace, which is part of a Swiss-German chain of hotels, claims that Natalie has been able to continue with a normal lifestyle.

A spokesman said: 'This matter is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit currently in the UAE court system.

'We cannot publicly comment on this case or discuss it with any third parties.'
