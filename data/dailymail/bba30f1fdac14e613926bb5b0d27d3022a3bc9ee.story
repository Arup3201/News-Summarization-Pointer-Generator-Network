An 18-year-old black student who was shot to death by an off-duty St Louis police officer was attacked from behind and killed after he had collapsed, an autopsy has revealed.

The finding corroborates witness accounts that Vonderrit Myers Jr was running away from the cops when he died, the family's attorney declared.

And despite claims that the teenager sparked the conflict by firing at the officer, the Myers family legal team today insisted his DNA was not on the gun recovered from the scene.

Fatal wound: He was rendered unconscious by the eighth shot which was dealt to the side of his head

Myers was gunned down by an unidentified 32-year-old in Shaw, Missouri, on October 9 - exactly two months after unarmed teenager Michael Brown was killed by a cop less than 10 miles away.

Today Dr Cyril Wecht, a private pathologist  employed by the family, said one of the eight bullet wounds would have ruptured the teenager's femur, causing him to collapse. 

He was shot another five times in his legs, and once in his groin, before he was rendered unconscious by the fatal wound dealt to the side of his head.

The St Louis Police Department has maintained that Myers fired three shots at the officer using a gun that was recovered from the scene.

However, although Wecht found gunpowder residue on Myers, he said it is not clear whether he had been holding a gun or was simply near the gun. 

Jerryl Christmas, the family's attorney, said: 'It is clear from the evidence from the autopsy report that this individual was shot from behind as he was trying to run away. There is no indication of any frontal shots.'

He added that there was none of Myers' DNA on the gun recovered from the scene. 

Police have yet to comment on the findings.

Earlier this month, police released details of lab tests by the Missouri State Highway Patrol that showed gunshot residue on Myers' hand, waistband and shirt. Police union leaders said the finding dispelled claims by Myers' family that he didn't shoot at the officer.

Emotional: His family embraced as they listened to the distressing report of Vonderrit's fatal injuries

Defiant: Jerryl Christmas stated that the findings prove Vonderrit was running away from the cops as he died

Unclear: Wecht said it is not clear whether Myers was holding a gun or simply near a gun at the time. A report by police claims he fired at the officer and there was gunpowder on him but his DNA was not found on the gun

The family has claimed Myers was unarmed, and that the officer mistook a sandwich he was holding for a gun.

St. Louis Police Officers' Association business manager Jeff Roorda cited other evidence against Myers during a news conference earlier this month: Social media photos that Roorda said show Myers holding three guns, one of them a 9 mm Smith & Wesson. Roorda said it is likely the gun Myers used to shoot at the officer.

Roorda and St. Louis city medical examiner Dr. Michael Graham did not immediately return messages for comment Thursday.

The shooting set off a new round of intense protests similar to those in Ferguson after 18-year-old Michael Brown's death. Both Brown and Myers were black. Both officers are white. 

A grand jury is expected to decide by mid-November whether criminal charges will be filed against Darren Wilson, the Ferguson officer who shot the unarmed Brown.

The St. Louis officer in the Myers shooting has not been named and is on administrative leave while the case is investigated.

Protests outside Ferguson police station: It comes as demonstrations over the deadly August 9 shooting of Brown, who was also black, by officer Darren Wilson in the St Louis suburb of Ferguson have intensified

'End racism': Thousands of protesters have stormed the streets of St Louis following the teenagers' deaths 

The officer was off duty and doing patrol work for a security job in a neighborhood near the Missouri Botanical Garden in south St. Louis. 

Although he wasn't on police time, he was wearing his uniform and armed with his department-issued gun, which is common practice in St. Louis.

St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson has said the officer became suspicious when Myers and the men with him started to run. 

A chase ensued and the officer and Myers got into a physical confrontation. After Myers pulled away, Dotson said, he went up a hill and started shooting at the officer.

Ballistic evidence shows Myers fired three shots before his gun jammed, Dotson said. Police said they recovered the gun, which had been reported stolen in September.
