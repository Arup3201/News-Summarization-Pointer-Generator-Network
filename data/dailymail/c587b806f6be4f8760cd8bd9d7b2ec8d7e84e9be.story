Sophie Tweed-Simmons - daughter of legendary Kiss bassist Gene Simmons - has launched her first fashion line, and it's all about making young women feel their best whatever their size.

Fed up with over-priced, ill-fitting clothes, the curvaceous 22-year-old entrepreneur joined forces with TheStyleClub to create the 18-piece collection; priced between $25 and $115 in sizes small, medium and large, and all named after strong and influential  women.

'The cuts of the pieces are all flattering,' Sophie, based in Los Angeles, tells MailOnline. 'All the waistbands are elastic, which I prefer. Essentially, the collection is based around my butt.'

Sophie, a passionate advocate for healthy body image having grown up in a Hollywood bubble where appearances mean everything, stands at 5'8" and is a U.S. size 8-10.

'I have never been a "skinny" girl, I've always been athletic and curvy and strong,' she remarks, adding that her weight has fluctuated over the years.

'So yeah, the hot pants trend wasn’t a good look for me. And I struggled trying so hard to fit in growing up.

'I went through a laundry list of things that got me to this point of thinking I'm pretty awesome. No one has to sell me on me, I already like me.'

While Sophie, whose mother Shannon Tweed was a famous Playboy Bunny, concedes there is no 'normal' body type, she made sure her collection was cut around 'proven classics.'

'The skirts are pencil and the sweaters are adorably oversized and look amazing tucked or untucked,' she says, adding that she wears a size medium in the shorts and a size large in the skirts.

'But we also wanted some risk in there so we have the Peron shorts, which are high-waisted and cut more like a basketball short. The tomboy in me loves them.'

Because it is the first collection, Sophie went with the standard small, medium and large sizing options. 'If we get demand for other sizes we will make them.

'And that's how it should be. We don't want to limit who buys the collection based on sizing; the cuts will look good on everyone.

'We want our shoppers to be part of the process with us. So give us feedback and tell us what's working on your body. Just because it works on my butt doesn't mean it works for everyone.'

As far as her personal favorites, Sophie is particularly proud of the glittering double-slip Sappho skirt.

'It is stretchy, so I don't worry about ripping my seam in a delicate sequined skirt at a party,' she says.

'And it has built in shorts underneath, so you don't have to worry about any flashing mishaps.'

She adds: 'The Monroe faux fur because it's just badass, and the Arianna sweater. I love a soft white sweater, it never goes out of style.'

Sophie also made a point of keeping the line animal cruelty-free, so none of the pieces are real leather or fur.

'I do not condone fur. There is no use for it,' she reveals. 'We aren't shivering in caves anymore. We are modern women who have the consciousness to make the choice not to skin an animal.

'I understood when it was for survival but now it's a little ridiculous.'

Self-approval: 'I went through a laundry list of things that got me to this point of thinking I'm pretty awesome. No one has to sell me on me, I already like me,' she says 

Sophie, who recently signed with Kitten Model Group’s Bombshell division - a unique agency which celebrates real body image and real sized women - was also careful to keep the prices reasonable.

'I was trying on clothes in a store - which I won't name - and everything was ill-fitting and incredibly overpriced, and I just had it,' she explains of her inspiration behind the line.

'I would rather have a few cute pieces I can wear over and over again which aren't as expensive as a couture coat that is only applicable at the Met Ball.'

Sophie named each item after strong, influential women whom she admires.

'We wanted girls to not only feel confident when wearing fun, fearless clothing but to think about the women that came before them blazing the trail for all of us,' she explains.

Basics: The $48 Sheryl blouse (left) and the $65 Jane cardigan (right)

There's the aforementioned faux-fur jacket, named after Marilyn Monroe, a sweater named after Gwen Stefani and another named after Oprah.

There's a crop top named after poet Emily Dickinson, a cardigan named after writer Jane Austin, a miniskirt named after recent Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, a turtleneck named after Hillary Clinton and a faux-leather skirt named after Michelle Obama.

And she may be a budding fashion designer, with a diamond jewelry line in the pipeline next, but that's not all the vivacious character has up her sleeve.

As well as being a model and an actress, she's penning a book aimed at young girls, and gearing up to release her first EP; having written all her own songs.

She is also the founder of Sophie’s Place in Vancouver, Canada; a shelter which provides a place of sanctuary and support for vulnerable young people.

'The best thing about growing up these days is you don't have to be one thing anymore,' she says. 'I can be as many slashes as I want! I'm all for women doing it all and doing it well.'

Asked what three pieces of advice she'd give herself as an insecurities-ridden teen, Sophie states: 'Stop dieting, you're 12. Go outside and live.

'And tell your High school bully and resident mean girl to f*** off. She doesn't know you or what you're capable of, and you'll rise above.

'She can watch from the nosebleed seats. But forgive her, she has her own struggles.'

Finally: 'Don't let any boy, man - or woman for that matter - tell you what you need, want, should do, can do or can't do. Those are all your decisions to make.'
