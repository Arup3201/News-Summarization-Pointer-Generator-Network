Angel Di Maria left Switzerland full-back Ricardo Rodriguez on the floor with a fleet-footed piece of skill on the right flank and burst to the byline, with five Argentina team-mates waiting in the box for that killer cross.

Then, with no-one around him and time to pick out a man, he went for an unnecessary, extravagant rabona pass. As his left boot wrapped around the outside of his right, the ball skewed off the pitch.

Another chance wasted, an opportunity gone. His team-mates looked away. It just about summed up Di Maria's match.

Fluke? Angel Di Maria went for an unnecessary rabona pass and it failed to come off - a trend of his game

Frustrated: Di Maria's performance was well below par despite winning the match for Argentina in added time

51 - Di Maria gave the ball away 51 times

4 - Just four crosses were good out of 19 tries

63 - His pass completion was at 63 per
 cent, the worst of any outfield player to start and the worst of any 
player in the tournament who has played 40 minutes or more

12 - He had 12 shots, three were on target

The Real Madrid attacking midfielder may well be remembered for scoring the decisive goal against Switzerland, finishing off Lionel Messi's clever run through the middle with a low shot into the bottom left corner to send his side through to the quarter-finals, but his will go down as one of the worst match-winning performances in history.

Di Maria gave the ball away 51 times. He struck 19 crosses and only four of them were any good. His pass completion was down at 63 per cent, the worst of any outfield player to start the game and the worst of any player in the tournament who has played more than 40 minutes of a match.

'I suppose that's what this World Cup is about, the worst player on the pitch scores the winning goal,' Alan Hansen said afterwards on the BBC. 'He was lucky to still be on there when he scored as he had played so badly.

'He only lost the ball 51 times? That's amazing, I thought he lost it more than that.'

Alan Shearer 
further twisted the knife, adding: 'He gave it away so many times, 
whether it was on the left-hand side, whether it was on the right-hand 
side, whether he was coming down the middle.

'He lost possession so many times trying to whip balls in and constantly hitting the front man.' 

Difference: Di Maria touched the ball plenty (right) but his completed passes were few and far between

Heat map: Di Maria was all over the place and gave the ball away a staggering 51 times

Chase: Di Maria runs with the ball as Granit Xhaka tries to stop him near the touchline

Di Maria's passes were intercepted – short ones, long ones, mid-distance ones; high ones, low ones.

His crosses were cut out, or headed away. His runs mainly ended at the first man.

The astonishingly bad level of his performance was the antithesis of his incredibly high tenacity to keep going and going and going.

He struck 12 shots during the game, even though only three of those landed on target.

Lionel Messi, who admittedly had a poorer game than his usual standard, must've wondered what he had to do to help his team through after creating eight goal-scoring chances in the match before Di Maria finally converted one of them in extra-time.

Di Maria has missed just one minute so far of Argentina's World Cup campaign, coming off in the final minute of their 1-0 win against Iran in the group stage.

Their last-16 game on Tuesday was the one blip in an otherwise solid tournament from the 26-year-old. Although, like the rest of his Argentina team-mates, he has been bailed out by Messi on too many occasions.

But regardless of all the damning statistics and the armchair critics, Shearer summed it up succinctly:

'You know what? No-one will remember that whatsoever. They'll remember that one piece of magic that got them through to the quarter-finals, that's what people will remember.'
