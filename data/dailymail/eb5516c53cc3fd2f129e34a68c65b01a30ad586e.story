Mark Myles will face court for allegedly underpaying staff at his childcare centre

A school principal who ran a childcare centre in two Sydney suburbs has been accused of paying employees as little as $2.15 an hour.

The Fairwork Ombudsman is alleging Mark Myles allegedly underpaid 16 staff a combined $362,000 over a five year period at  Bollygum Childcare Centres based at Penrith and Lethbridge Park in Sydney's western suburbs.

The workplace regulator alleges one staff member was paid just $2.15 an hour, while others received between $3.31 and $3.98 before it went into liquidation last year.

The legal, award wages for childcare workers are more than three times higher at between $17.25 and $19.64 an hour. 

A spokesman for United Voice, the union which represents childcare workers in NSW, said if the claims were accurate  they would constitute the most  severe breach of underpayments he has seen.

'Underpayment is fairly common but this is an extreme case - we are talking pretty gross underpayments,' he said. 

Mr Myles is now facing court over the payments he allegedly made to vulnerable, young staff at the centre which moved from Penrith to Lethbridge Park.

Daily Mail Australia has attempted to contact Mr Myles over the allegations without success.

The Bollygum Childcare Centre at Penrith and Letheridge Park went into liquidation last year and is now under new operators

Mr McElrea claims the standard hourly rate for an unqualified staff member - who he believes many of the workers would have been - is $17.25 an hour.

'For someone with a certificate III qualification it is $19.64.' 

In a statement of claim filed in the Federal Circuit Court The Ombudsman alleges a woman, aged in her early 20s, was underpaid close to $50,000 less than she was entitled to over four years.

Another allegedly had her rostered hours reduced after she complained to The Ombudsman about her working conditions.

The claims state that seven of the 16 staff were aged under 21 at the time of the alleged breaches - between 2008 and 2013.

Employees were allegedly paid flat hourly rates, which did not cover minimum hourly rates, casual loadings, overtime rates, annual leave entitlements or a laundry allowance.

The pay rates varied significantly between staff - with some being paid substantially above their lawful minimum entitlements for some work.

Mr Myles faces maximum penalties of between $3300 and $10,200 per breach.

The alleged underpayments were made between 2008 and 2013 the year the centre went into liquidation

The Bollygum Childcare Centre, which was based at South Penrith before it moved to Lethbridge Park, in Sydney's far western suburbs, went into liquidation last year preventing legal action against the company.

The NSW Department of Education intervened this year when parents complained that the centre was without power for two days alleging children went without fresh milk and heating,'The Sydney Morning Herald reported. 

A Department of Education and Communities spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that Mr Myles' position as Winmalee Public School principal is unrelated to the allegations.

'This matter does not relate to the person’s role as principal,' he said. 

Fair Work Ombudsman Natalie James says the court action is a response to a number of factors surrounding the case, including the large amount of money said to be owing and the involvement of 'vulnerable, young workers.'

Ms James says the workplace regulator will pursue the court action based on the claim that Mr Myles was well informed of his obligations as an employer, but failed to ensure his business was compliant.

Mr McElrea agreed that as the director of the business there is no way that Mr Myles would not have known his workers were being underpaid. 

The Fair Work Ombudsman will seek a Court Order for any penalty to be paid to the employees to partially rectify the alleged underpayments.
