Janet Street Porter wears a purple patterned dress, £55, from Long Tall Sally. She said: 'Fitted perfectly. Bit too sensible for me, but many women will love this frock'

There are endless advantages to being tall. It doesn't matter where I sit in the cinema or theatre, I can always see (I don’t worry about the poor souls who have to sit behind me!).

And all my vital statistics are spaced a bit further apart, so I can easily pass for a dress size smaller than my usual size 14 (or 16 if I’ve been eating a lot of carbs and loafing about).

However, there are downsides. Finding clothes that fit is really difficult, especially if you're out of your 20s.

The young and super-slender can get away with really short clothes from regular ranges on the High Street, (relying on opaque tights to save their modesty).

But once you get older and want stuff that's fashionable and not mumsy, the problems begin.

And don't even get me started on finding decent shoes - women who are 6ft tall like me generally have size 8 feet, and most shops just go up to size 7.

Once, only models were tall, but now it's the norm. My generation got free school milk and turned out to be giants, and in the subsequent decades girls have just got taller.

But clothing manufacturers seem reluctant to cater for this growing market. One Mail reader, Rachel Smith, emailed me to protest about this.

'I don't understand why tall clothing is being taken out of High Street stores like New Look, Dorothy Perkins and Next. All the places that tall women relied on to dress them for work, for parties or just casualwear.

'These stores think it's ok to stock the odd "long" pair of trousers, most of which are so awful they've been left on the rail for a month. And yet, the "petite" range is still going strong in most stores, fully stocked with the latest trends.'

Rachel makes the point that many tall ranges are now available solely online, and that when you buy on the internet, you can't try things on, you have to pay a delivery charge, and finding tall ranges online can be confusing.

She asks: 'Would stores get rid of disabled access because it wasn't being used enough? Of course not. So why treat tall women as if they don't matter?'

My sentiments entirely.

Why are tall women treated like fashion pariahs? Why should we have to spend twice as long as everyone else shopping for clothes? Even if we are prepared to spend a lot of money on designer clothes, it's difficult to get something which fits.

I've noticed that coats have become shorter than ever. On me they now just about cover my backside, and are basically long jackets.

Tall women can never buy any clothing with a waist - even if they are lucky enough to have a waist - because it will be situated just under their bust in normal clothing ranges.

Slim pickings: Janet says there aren't enough High Street stores stocking clothes for tall women

All fitted clothing in standard ranges is cut to suit regular proportions, but tall girls need more length in the body.

As a stock size 14, tops are not really a problem - as long as I don't want sleeves that actually reach my wrist. Shirts are impossible. Jackets fit, but if they are waisted, it will be about three inches too far north.

Sleeves that are supposed to end just below the elbow - three-quarter length - look horrific, bunching up around the fattest bit of our arms. Sweaters are about the only thing a tall girl can buy easily.

Dresses, even by top designers, either just cover the knee, which is ok, because that will still be a decent length - or are cut so short that they look like tunics.

When you buy clothes online, they rarely
 provide the length of the skirt or dress, so you can never be sure if 
they'll be decent enough

Of course, we can go to specialist shops like Long Tall Sally, but why should our choice be so pitifully small?

Designers routinely showcase their collections on super-tall catwalk models, but then manufacture them for very short people. The reason is probably to keep costs down, because fabric costs money and skirts the length of a pelmet are cheaper to manufacture than something more practical for women over 5ft 4in.

I used to regularly shop for trousers at Topshop and Dorothy Perkins, but their ranges have definitely got smaller. Upmarket brands like Cos really score well - they cut dresses so cleverly a size large fits me perfectly and is sufficiently long. I can't recommend them enough - but if you don't live in London, you can only shop online, with less choice. 

Some of the Edition ranges at Debenhams are great, too. But when you buy clothes online, they rarely provide the length of the skirt or dress, so you can never be sure if they'll be decent enough for travel on public transport, and you have to pay delivery charges.

I'm lucky enough to have a stylist who scours the High Street to find me clothes to wear on ITV's Loose Women (and posts the details on its website).

But most tall women rightly feel very fed up.

Why do retailers hate us so much when we look so good in clothes? You'd think they’d be fighting to dress us. Sadly, the reverse is true.

NEXT: This red lace dress, £60, would be lovelyon someone no larger than a size 10, as the flared skirt emphasises the hips

COS: This Spray pattern dress, £89, hangsbeautifully - and, best of all, the length is perfect fortaller women

TOPSHOP: Tall range jeans, £36 to £42. I have bought them and while they aren't great quality, they are cheap and always come in the latest colours

M&S: These £35 treggings in long fitted well, better than wider trousers which tend to make tall girls look like traffic wardens if not tailored properly to flatter our backsides
