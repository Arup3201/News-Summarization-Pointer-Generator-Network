A raucous house party ended like a scene from a horror film when a Russian immigrant allegedly butchered his roommate to death.

Sergey Mamontov, 50, reportedly confessed to police that he got into a violent fight with his victim, chopped him up into pieces and tried to dissolve the remains in vats of bleach.

Mamontov pounced on his roommate, 55, after he found him drinking with friends at 'a wild party' in their fourth-floor Brooklyn apartment, New York.

He threw them out and became embroiled in the fatal fistfight which ended in the unnamed man's death.

The victim's death had gone unnoticed until yesterday, when a friend of the dead man visited the apartment to look for him.

But Mamontov then allegedly said: 'You're not going to see him any more - I cut him up,' according to the New York Post.

The man alerted police who reportedly found vats containing bleach and acid and what appeared to be human body parts inside the flat and within the suspect's refrigerator.

A friend of the deceased called police to the scene when he saw vats in the refrigerator with what appeared to be human remains

It was packed with a five-gallon bucket and eight smaller Clorox bottles, sources told the paper.

Body parts and a rib cage were also uncovered in the fridge, a source told the tabloid. 'There isn't even room for an egg in the refrigerator', another source added.

The paper reported that police investigators collected two Goodwill donation boxes which stank of human decaying flesh and trawled through every piece of rubbish from the building by hand in their search for more body parts.

The pair had been sharing an apartment together for six months after Mamontov had rented out a room, but they did not get along, he revealed to police.

Police then searched two Goodwill boxes that smelled like rotting flesh and combed all the trash in the building as they searched for more remains

Suspect Mamontov, who has previously been charged twice for drink driving and for grand larceny, told officers he chopped up his roommate and soaked his body parts in bleach as he hoped to destroy the evidence, sources claimed.

A teenager, who lives in the flat directly below Mamontov, told of the moment he heard strange noises coming from upstairs.

Alan Lazebnik, 16, a student at James Madison High School, told The New York Post: 'Me and my mom heard something really hard fell and I heard screaming. It was quick. I heard screaming, but it scared me.'

The city's Medical Examiner's Office is studying suspected body parts, including what looked like fingers, to confirm they are human.

Mamontov was being held in custody last night.
