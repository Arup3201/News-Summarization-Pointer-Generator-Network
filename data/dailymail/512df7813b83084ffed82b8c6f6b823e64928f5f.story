Enigmatic striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic has reacted angrily to being named the second greatest Swedish sports person of all time by a Swedish newspaper.

Readers of Dagens Nyheter voted five-time Wimbledon champion Bjorn Borg as their No 1, with Ibrahimovic finishing above table tennis player Jan-Ove Walder in third place.

However, after being congratulated by the newspaper, Ibrahimovic seemed far from pleased.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic feels he is the greatest Swedish sports person of all time

The 33-year-old feels that he should have topped list, despite Bjorn Bjorg's incredible achievements 

'Thank you but to finish second is like finishing last,' Ibrahimovic said.

'On that list I would have been No 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, with due respect to the others.'

Borg's achievements made him an obvious choice to head the list, with 11 grand slams to his name following a glittering tennis career.

And even Ibrahimovic, when asked about Borg's place at the top of the rankings, could not hide his admiration for the man.

'He is a cool person and a living legend,' Ibrahimovic added. 

Bjorn Borg won Wimbledon five years in a row, and collected 11 grand slam titles in total
