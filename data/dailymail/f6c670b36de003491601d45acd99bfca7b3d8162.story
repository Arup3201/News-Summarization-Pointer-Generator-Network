Former Nazi SS officer Erich Priebke during his first trial for the massacre of 335 Italians. His death and plans for burial sparked violent protests in Italy

Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, 
whose death sparked violent protests and a legal dispute over what to do
 with his body, has been secretly buried in an Italian prison cemetery.

The
 100-year-old died last month while living under house arrest for his role in one 
of the worst massacres of the Second World War in Italy.

A report in the Italian newspaper La Repubblica said Priebke was buried in a grave in a fenced-off area of the cemetery, ‘marked by a wooden cross in the underbrush.’

But the paper did not give details on 
where the cemetery is located, adding, that it was, ‘the only bit of 
Italian land where Priebke's death can go back to being just a death, 
not Nazi symbolism.’

Rome city authorities banned any burial out of fear it could become a Nazi pilgrimage site.

The Vatican issued an unprecedented 
order barring any Catholic church in the city from holding a funeral 
mass for the war criminal.

Argentina, where he had lived in exile and wanted to be buried, would not take the body either.

An attempt by the Italian authorities
 to hold a funeral for Priebke sparked rioting. Protestors surrounded 
the car which was carrying the body at the church of Lefebvriani.

So Priebke’s body was taken in the middle of the night in a grey station wagon to a military airport near Rome for safekeeping.

In a secret operation it was driven 
up the motorway for a couple of hours, before, ‘as dawn approached, the 
coffin was unloaded and loaded onto another car," before being driven 
into "a mountainous area,’ La Repubblica rerported.

'Even if we cannot reveal the location of his grave, the public should know that the affair has been brought to a close.’

Nicknamed the ‘Butcher of the Ardeatine Caves,’ Priebke always insisted that he had only ever obeyed orders.

The 335 victims of the massacre - mainly men and boys - were executed in March 1944 with a bullet to the neck. The slaughter was in retaliation for an attack by the resistance movement on SS soldiers.

Priebke managed like many Nazis to escape to Argentina at the end of World War II, evading the 1948 trial in Rome of other perpetrators.

Because of his age and ill-health he was allowed to serve out his life sentence at the home of his lawyer after being extradited from Argentina, where he lived a free man for nearly 50 years.

The Nazi war criminal, whose body has lain in limbo since he died two weeks ago, was finally interred after his lawyer claimed a deal was struck to bury him in a secret location.

His family and friends had refused requests by authorities to have him cremated and buried at sea like Osama bin Laden.

Former SS captain Priebke was serving a life sentence for the 1944 massacre of the Ardeatine Caves.

The slaughter outside Rome of 335 men and boys was a reprisal for an attack on Nazi police by resistance fighters.

His birth town of Henningsdorf in Germany said they could not accommodate him, and even Argentina, his adopted homeland refused to take back his body, saying it ‘would be an affront to humanity.'
