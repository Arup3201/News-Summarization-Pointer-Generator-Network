A woman has given birth to conjoined twin boys just 11 months after delivering her first child.

Michelle Brantley and fiance Bryan Mirabal were shocked when they discovered they had conceived six months after their Gage was born. 

On Friday, after 34 intense weeks of medical complications, Carter and Conner Mirabal, connected at the abdomen and facing each other, were born weighing 5lbs each.

The boys required immediate surgery to repair damage to their stomachs but emerged from the theater in good condition.

And in an unusual but optimistic circumstance, they do not appear to share any organs.

Miracle: Carter (right) and Conner (left) do not share organs which is rare for twins connected at the abdomen

Elated: Michelle Brantley was rushed to hospital early to give birth just 11 months after delivering her first son

The elated new parents wrote on Facebook: 'We are not out of the woods yet that was the best news we have heard [in] god knows how long!'

The boys were delivered on Friday night in Jacksonville, Florida, after Ms Brantley was rushed to hospital a month before the original due date and five days before a recently-scheduled c-section.

Shortly before midnight, she and Mr Mirabal welcomed their sons into the world - baby brothers for their first child Gage.

The twins are expected to remain conjoined and have been transferred to a special care unit for observation where they remain on ventilators. 

Aside from their livers, which appear to be connected in some way, Carter and Conner appear to be functioning independently of each other, doctors said. 

Doing well: Doctors said the boys are in a stable condition in an observation unit after emergency surgery

Prognosis: The boys will remain conjoined while doctors and their parents discuss the best way forward

Adorable: Their foot prints were taken as Ms Brantley and fiance Bryan Mirabal celebrated the successful birth

And despite suffering minor heart complications at first, Carter's heart is strengthening. 

The survival rate for conjoined twins is between five and 25 per cent. 

Ms Brantley and Mr Mirabal have spent the pregnancy in constant contact with Atlanta couple Robin and Michael Hamby, whose conjoined twin sons died the day they were born on December 5.

The Hamby boys - Asa and Eli - survived just 34 hours before developing an atrial flutter - where the heart beats of of sync - which sent their heart rate to 300 beats a minute.

Ms Brantley had rescheduled her c-section for next week instead of January but went into labor on Friday

Hopes: The life expectancy of conjoined twins is low and the family is praying for the boys to pull through

Angelic: The happy couple have been documenting the entire pregnancy and each stage of the birth

Surprised! Ms Brantley shared a picture of her ballooning pregnant belly just days before her waters broke

Doctors tried to regulate the rhythm with drugs, but ultimately could not save the boys.

Ms Brantley wrote a tribute to the Hamby family on Facebook: 'Our hearts go out to the Hamby family, although yalls precious baby boys only spent one day on earth, they will spend a life time watching over you guys from heaven above. 

'We're praying for your family now and forever. Please everyone pray for the Hamby family, they need your prayers. R.I.P Angel babies! ‪#‎teamHamby‬.'
