A council has ordered its bin men not to go down uneven rural roads because they could suffer 'whole body vibrations'.

Residents in Fife, which recently introduced a new three bin system for rubbish, have been left to drag their own bins, sometimes for long distances, after the local authority instructed refuse workers not to go down roads with 'too many potholes'.

Nearly 500 people have complained about the extra loads they will need to pull so the council workers don't have to experience the 'vibrations'.

Vibrating binmen: Refuse workers in Fife, Scotland, have been ordered to steer clear of country roads with too many potholes (file picture for illustration only)

In one road in St Andrews - Prior Letham Road - residents will have to hike 39 bins half-a-mile, to the road-end.

Some have questioned the decision, saying postmen travel on the roads every day.

The Health and Safety Executive describes 'whole body vibration' as: 'Transmitted through the seat or feet of employees who drive mobile machines, or other work vehicles, over rough and uneven surfaces as a main part of their job'.

Threat: Fife council is concerned their bin men could be vibrated by potholes

Liberal Democrat Councillor Donald 
Macgregor (East Neuk & Landward) said: 'Residents in rural areas 
have been informed of a new three-bin refuse collection service, 
enabling the recycling of cans, plastics, paper and cardboard.

'However, if the access road is considered unsuitable due to the quality of its surface, the number of potholes or its narrowness, then residents will have to take their bins to the end of the road for collection.

'This is to avoid the staff being exposed to potentially damaging 'whole body vibration'.'

Cllr Macgregor pointed out that whole body vibration was a European legislation concept not universally accepted.

In
response to Cllr Macgregor's questions at a recent Fife Council 
meeting, officials said that despite the number of appeals there was no 
need to review the arrangements as anyone dissatisfied with the result 
could use the corporate complaints procedure.

Access roads are assessed by a recycling advisor and a council lorry driver.

Cllr Macgregor said that he would be happy to be present on-site during these inspections.

He
said: 'Tractor drivers, post office workers and others drive up these 
roads and tracks without any evidence of whole body vibration damage.

'The
concept of whole body vibration is a product of European legislation 
which, as I understand it, has been ignored by, for example, the 
construction industry.

Burden: Many resident are being forced to drag their three required recycling bins up to half a mile away

'Rural residents pay the same taxes as their urban counterparts but receive a much reduced level of service.

'Their refuse bins should continue to be collected from the same locations as they are now.'Fife
Council’s waste collection service manager Martin Kingham said: 'Fife 
Council has a responsibility to protect its employees from injuries 
resulting from carrying out their jobs. 'Altering
the way Fife Council collects waste from rural properties will not only
reduce the risk of injury to staff but also provide an improved 
recycling service.

'We 
carried out a very thorough assessment of the 5,400 rural properties we 
collect waste from and based our decision on the information gathered 
and advice from independent consultants.

Liberal Democrat Councillor Donald Macgregor said the decision had been made to avoid staff being exposed to potentially damaging 'whole body vibration'

'We understand residents will have concerns about a change in service which is why we have written to every affected householder and explained to them the reason for moving them to a road-end collection.

'If householders upgrade their access road they we can review our decision. We would be very happy to carry out a reassessment once any upgrading work has been completed.

He added: 'Fife Council has information from independent consultants that shows that rural collection staff are exposed to unacceptably high levels of exposure to whole body vibration. As a result we must take action.

'Risk assessments were completed for each access track leading to rural properties. If the access road was deemed unsuitable then bins would be moved to road end in order to reduce the risks to our employees'.Fife Council says the following factors would make an access road unsuitable due to the risk of 'vibrations'.

Potholes greater than 40 cm (about an inch and a half) deep.An 'unsuitably surfaced' access road.

Maggie Picken, 41, who owns the St Andrews Coach Houses, in Priorletham, said the council hadn’t seemed to be consistent in the houses they picked.

She said: 'The council sent out about
4000 letters and about 500 people appealed the decision for end of road
collection, of which we were one.

'One of the issues was health and safety on rural roads and whole body vibration for the bin men.'My husband goes up on the farm equipment on the road, the previous bin men used it and other people seem to be fine on it.

'We
were very unhappy about it as we pay our council tax just like everyone
else, but wouldn’t get the same service. Our road is about three 
quarters of a mile long, it’s a long way to drag a bin.

In one road in St Andrews - Prior Letham Road - residents will have to hike 39 bins half-a-mile, to the road-end

'There doesn’t seem to be any consistency either, other people who have bin collections on a different day to us, but on our road, were still getting the service.

'We would see bin lorries going passed our house, and further up the road for collection, but they said they couldn’t get ours.

'A lot of people who live on these roads are also very elderly, and they can’t be trekking bins about.'We had a meeting with the council yesterday and reached some solution, but it is only as we were very vocal about it.

'There will be many other people out of the 4000 who are stuck with this system as they don’t know what to do'.
