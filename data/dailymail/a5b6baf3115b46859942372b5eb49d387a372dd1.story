Meet Amazon's top reviewer: a 5'2" woman from Boston who has a bad back, looks cute in a winter hat, and can write for days about Burt's Bees lip balm.

Ali Julia, or so she calls herself, has many opinions.

And every single one has more sway than any of the millions of customers that flock to the e-commerce site every day.

Celebrities would balk at her daily influx of freebies from companies trying their best to curry favor with the critical powerhouse.

And though she remains a mystery, her 2,800 reviews - up to four a day - have revealed gems of information about the woman behind the screen.

In an investigation compiled by Boston Globe, we now know Ali Julia has dry eyes.

At one point, her every whim was controlled by a blister on her fourth toe. And it keeps coming back.

Her Honda CR-V is also a constant worry, but she can put them off momentarily to let rip on printer cartridges and tax preparation software.

According to the Globe, Ali Julia rose to cyber fame with a landmark review of The Long Reach Comfort Wipe, which 97 out of 101 people found to be useful.

And although she handed out an underwhelmed three stars for her first book review, the author conceded that that was probably fair.

Ploughing on tirelessly it is clear the reaction did not go to her head. 

The only detail she has revealed on her biography is that she is an engineer. And she likes photography.

The gritty stuff - such as the fact that she hates mint - is saved for her masterpieces.

Her stairs are carpeted, but the rest is floorboard.

And Mr Ali Julia, the First Lord of Amazon, has a size 50 chest.
