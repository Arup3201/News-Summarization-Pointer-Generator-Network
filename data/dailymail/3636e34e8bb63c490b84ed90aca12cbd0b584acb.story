An extreme snowmobiler who plunged into a freezing ravine says he was so certain that he would die that he wrote goodbye letters to his wife and children.

But 33 hours after Barry Sadler fell 3,000 feet into a creek in northwestern Montana on Sunday, his friends miraculously found him alive after following his tracks and directed him out to safety.

Sadler - who even put on goggles so crows wouldn't peck out his eyes when he died - did not think he would live to tell the tale.

'When you're an extreme snowmobiler and you get lost, you're usually dead,' the 54-year-old told KECI-TV. 'You're going places where people won't go - where people shouldn't go.'

Lucky to be alive: Barry Sadler, 54, fell into a creek in Montana on Sunday after he was snowmobiling along a steep ridge. He thought he would not survive, so wrote goodbye notes to his wife and three children

The bodybuilder and MMA fighter, from Mullan, Idaho, was 'side-hilling' - snowmobiling along a steep ridge with one ski in the snow and one in the air - with friends when he took one wrong turn and the snow suddenly dropped out beneath him, he said.

He dropped down a chute and into the ravine, landing in a creek with his snowmobile on top of him and breaking some bones in his hands.

He was able to push away the sled, and switched on its engine for heat every 90 minutes over the next 30-plus hours - until it ran out of gas at around 10pm Monday.

As part of his extreme mindset, he had also climbed on the snowmobile without survival gear or water. 

At one point he even accepted he might die from carbon monoxide poisoning because, when his snowmobile did have gas, he was getting so close to it to keep warm.

Final moments: He switched on his snowmobile (pictured) intermittently for heat and huddled beneath it for protection, but thought he would die. He even put on goggles so birds would not pluck out his eyes

Back home: Sadler is pictured enjoying being back home in Mullan, Idaho after five friends followed his tracks into the ravine and found him. They managed to pull him out and trek off the mountain

Certain he would never be found alive, he wrote goodbye notes to his wife and three children, aged 20, 18 and 16, on his cellphone and placed it in his jacket's inside pocket.

'I'm not a quitter,' he said. 'But I knew there was no way I was coming out of there.' 

Speaking to KHQ, he recalled the pain of feeling as if he was freezing to death. 

'It's not quick. It's drawn out, and you're shaking so violently it hurts,' he said. 

But about two hours after his gas ran out, five friends who had followed his snowmobile track hiked into the ravine and rescued him.

'These guys shook me,' he said. 'I wake up, and all I see are two lights, and I thought they were angels. And I was kind of out of it, and the only thing I asked was, "What are you guys doing here?"'

The men gave him dry clothes, blankets and food, but they were still a long way from home.

Fighting fit: Sadler, pictured in his gym in 2011, is a bodybuilder and extreme sportsman - but was scolded by sheriff's deputies for choosing to ride his snowmobile without proper gear or water

Relief: His relieved wife Dana said she believed her husband was alive 'by the grace of God'

It took five hours to hike out of the drainage, and they had to walk another two miles to reach the snowmobiles. They then rode an additional six miles to Sadler's house.

'It was everything I could do to hold on,' Sadler told the Shoshone News-Press.

Sadler suffered some broken bones in his hands, frostbite, hypothermia and dehydration but is now back home with his wife, Dana. He predicts he'll be healthy enough to be back on his snowmobile in about a month.

Dana told KECI she believes her husband only survived 'by the grace of God... and really good friends'.

Two sheriff's deputies involved in the search scolded Sadler for riding by himself and without survival gear, an avalanche beacon or a satellite locator.
