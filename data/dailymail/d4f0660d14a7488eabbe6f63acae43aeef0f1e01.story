Motorists could be forced to pay to drive ‘by the kilometre’ on British roads under plans being drawn up by bureaucrats in Brussels.

EU Transport Commissioner Violeta Bulc said she was working on plans for an EU-wide road toll scheme in order to standardise charges across the continent.

The scheme would require every car to be fitted with an electronic device containing a satellite receiver that would record the distance travelled and bill the motorist accordingly.

Miss Bulc said the scheme could be made ‘obligatory’ across the EU.

The idea last night provoked an angry reaction in London, where ministers insisted there were no plans to introduce a national road toll scheme in Britain.

The last proposal for a national ‘road pricing’ scheme was abandoned by Labour in 2007 in the face of overwhelming public opposition.

A senior Tory source said: ‘There are no plans for road tolls in the UK, whatever this EU bureaucrat might say. It is hard to see any UK driver welcoming this bonkers idea and if they want a referendum on our relationship with the EU they need to vote for a Conservative government.’

Robert Oxley, campaign director at the campaign group Business for Britain, said new road tolls would cripple British motorists.

Mr Oxley said: ‘Motorists and firms already pay enough to use the roads, without EU tolls adding to that burden. It's ludicrous that the EU would even consider hitting hard-pressed drivers with further charges. It appears some in the commission just don't understand that decisions like these should be taken in the UK, not Brussels.’

But Miss Bulc insisted the time had come to consider the introduction of a common road pricing scheme operating across the EU.

She said there were many different systems in Europe at the moment and claimed this was a burden on car drivers and an obstacle to their mobility.

She told the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag that it made sense to work on a European system for lorries and cars that could regulate road charges in a uniform manner for all EU countries.

‘The amount of the fee should, in my opinion, be exclusively based on the number of kilometres actually driven and should not be time-dependent,’ she said.

‘It doesn't matter where you come from - everyone will only pay for the distance they have actually driven and it will be billed on a device throughout Europe. We're currently investigating just such an idea.’

Miss Bulc said no decision had yet been made on whether countries like Britain would be allowed to seek an opt-out from the new regime.

She said: ‘There are many options - a fee could be obligatory but it's also possible to make it optional i.e. that countries decide themselves whether and on which roads they want to levy a road use charge based on kilometres driven.’

The last Labour government spent years trying to introduce a national road pricing scheme in Britain. It was finally abandoned in 2007 after 1.8 million people signed a petition against it. Many motorists feared the charges would just be a new tax on top of road tax and fuel duty.

As a result, the UK still has only a relatively small number of toll roads and road pricing schemes.
