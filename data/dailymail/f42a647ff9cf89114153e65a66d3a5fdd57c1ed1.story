A woman killed after a speeding rally car careered off a forest track into a crowd of spectators has been named this evening by police.

Joy Robson, 50, is believed to be a nursery teacher from Portree, which is on the Isle of Skye.

She was killed this morning after the vehicle lost control on a hairpin 
bend and flipped over, before crashing into a tree and landing on top of her. It also hit an eight-year-old boy, who was taken to hospital with injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening.

The tragedy happened during the first stage of the Highland Car Club Snowman Rally, a high-profile annual cross-country event, which took place despite muddy and slippery conditions.

The young boy - understood to not be related - and Ms Robson were pinned under the yellow Honda Civic and around 20 distraught spectators rushed to lift the vehicle off them.

Northern Constabularly later confirmed Ms Robson had died as a result of her injuries and the injured boy was in Raigmore Hospital, where his condition was not thought to be life-threatening.

A third spectator suffered minor injuries as a result of the collision and has been described as police as 'walking wounded'.

Neither the driver, who is believed to be Graeme Schoneville - a leading 1600cc competitor from Lanarkshire - nor  his co-driver were injured in the accident, which happened at around 10.30am. 

It took place six miles in to the opening leg of the Highland Car Club Snowman Rally at Balnain in Glen Urquhart Forest, about five miles west of Loch Ness.

The horrifying incident was witnessed by dozens of spectators there for the rally, which started in 1955 and is run by the Highland Car Club. It covers 44 miles with cars racing against the clock on rough tracks through forests.

Around 20,000 spectators usually turn out to watch the various legs of the race, which was abandoned after the horrific accident.

Speaking this evening, one witness, Kyle Reid, a 21-year-old rally enthusiast from Inverness, revealed he was just yards away when the horror unfolded.

He explained: ‘We were standing near a fast corner leading into a hairpin when we saw this yellow Honda Civic come round the bend. It must have been slippy at that part because most of the cars were sliding off it down into the hairpin.

‘We think it must have hit something because it tipped over onto its side and careered into a tree where there was a man with his two kids and an older woman standing.

‘The car wiped out the tree, one minute it was there, the next it was gone and the impact must have righted the car. But the woman and the little boy were trapped underneath.

‘There was loads of screaming and we rushed over to the scene with around 20 other spectators to lift the car off the woman and the wee boy.

‘It all happened in seconds and with so many people it didn’t take long for us to get the car off them. Both were conscious at the time. We spoke to the boy’s father, who was also there with his daughter, and he said they had all stood behind the tree because they thought it was safer.

‘I don’t know the people so I have no 
idea if they are local. The woman had been trapped under the driver’s 
wheel and was lying in the recovery permission until the ambulance staff
arrived.

‘She was complaining of a sore back and side and when the paramedics they strapped her to a board before they moved her.

‘The little boy was carried to a nearby Jeep with a flat bed where he waited for the ambulance men. We all got a shock. It is rare for accidents like this to happen and we are all desperately sorry for the woman’s family. Hopefully the little boy will be okay.’

One driver added: ‘I’ve been competing in the Snowman for a number of years, but the crowds in the opening stage today were bigger than I ever remember. 

‘Because of the number of people watching, there was just no margin for error for the drivers.

Probe: A vehicle is taken away from the scene of the accident following the crash. It is not known if this is the car which was involved

‘Spectators are always warned to expect the unexpected, because rally cars, at high speed, can change direction in a split second. But today’s incident is just tragic.

Dave Robson, Chairman of the championship, said: ‘The Management Committee, competitors and officials of the Scottish Rally Championship extend their condolences to the families of those involved in today’s incident.’

The rally scene in Scotland has witnessed a number of accidents in the past.

In 2010, Scots rally champion Jimmy Girvan, 56, was killed instantly when his Subaru Impreza spun out of control and finally came to rest in trees, trapping Mr Girvan’s co-driver and main sponsor Mike Ramsay inside the tangled wreckage. The accident happened in the Griffin section east of Aberfeldy during the Hankook Scottish Rally Championship.
