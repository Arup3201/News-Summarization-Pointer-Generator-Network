You know you are in the most expensive city in the world when a Geneva hotel sandwich and beer costs you £33 but Kevin Cooper is not here for the experience of wealth, more the wealth of experience.

As Roy Hodgson leads out England in Switzerland on Monday night, this 39-year-old from Derby will be contemplating a similar career path. Cooper does not have delusions of grandeur as the parallels with Hodgson are already emerging for the self-effacing manager of Servette in Switzerland's Challenge League.

Cooper was a journeyman midfielder, eight clubs plus another five on loan, and found himself on a steep learning curve coaching Cardiff City's U21s when the club's former commercial director Julian Jenkins approached him about a new project he was working on with Servette in Geneva.

Hodgson sought to learn his trade as a coach abroad prior to returning to England and for Cooper the prospect was too good to turn down.

'At my age, there are not too many opportunities in England to manage a club of this stature and pedigree,' says Cooper. 'As soon as I met the owner Hugh Quennec and spoke to Julian it was clear we had the same philosophy. They accepted that I was young and would make mistakes but there was no extra pressure. It was better than anything I could have imagined back in the UK.' 

Like many clubs, Servette had lost the connection with their support. A club rich in heritage, formed in 1890 and pioneer of the first attempted Champions League in 1930, they had lost their way and poor financial decisions led to them being declared bankrupt. Quennec, a Canadian-born businessman, was already the owner of Geneva's ice hockey team Geneve-Servette and, sensing an opportunity, bought the football club for one Swiss franc.

Cooper was appointed in June and the season began in July. He tried and failed to lure friend Craig Bellamy into following him. 

'Craig certainly had something to offer still as a player in my mind but he thought about it and sadly decided it wasn't for him but I brought over Sean Connelly as head of performance and Adam Owen from the Wales set-up as head of sports science and we got to work. Despite where we are, there is no big budget. It's about being sensible and thinking of the long-term. The young players and staff we inherited have been terrific and everyone has been very responsive.

'We have breakfast and lunch together and must be one of the fittest teams in the league. We beat our rivals Lausanne 2-1 last month and we missed a penalty in the 91st minute but got the winner in the 93rd. We kept going.' 

That spirit is rubbing off on the supporters too. Jenkins has promoted a 'one community, one club' campaign borrowed from his experience with Cardiff and the attendance for the Lausanne game was double that of when the two sides last met. They plan to give away tickets for 10 Swiss francs to keep the fans coming. 'Even in Geneva, not everyone can afford to go to football,' says Jenkins.

Keen to embrace the experience, manager Cooper is learning French, lives across the France border near Nyon and wakes up every morning to a view of the imperious Mont Blanc. 'It certainly makes you smile,' he says. 'It's a wonderful environment to play football but I can't lose sight of why I'm here. I'm ambitious and serious about building a career. I want to make this a success. We're spreading the word that the club is on its way back.' 

Journeyman: Cooper enjoyed spells with Cardiff and Wolves in the Football League among others

Cooper played for sharp-witted characters such as Jim Smith and Arthur Cox while he counts West Brom technical director Terry Burton, Malky Mackay, Dave Jones and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as people he can trust for advice. 

He has struck up a friendship with Switzerland assistant manager Michel Pont and, if all else fails, can turn to Geneve-Servette ice hockey coach Chris McSorley, a no-nonsense Canadian who was once accused of biting an opponent's nose.

As for calling on Roy Hodgson, he's happy to admire from afar for now. 'He's still held in high regard in Switzerland,' says Cooper. 'There is a lot of respect for him. For me he has to be a barometer of where I could go. I'm not saying I'm of that quality yet but he wasn't afraid to go abroad first and I think you have to be brave to get where you want to go. Other English aspiring coaches should take that route.' 

So will he be cheering on England on Monday? 'I'm taking the opportunity to go back to Cardiff for a few days with the wife and kids. I'll probably watch it in the pub, besides it's a cheaper pint back home.'
