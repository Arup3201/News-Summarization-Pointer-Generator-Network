An off-duty police superintendent who was refereeing an amateur football match tackled a suspected criminal when he ran onto the pitch chased by other officers.

Paul Beddow was officiating a Sunday league game when two men ran across the pitch in Hartlepool, County Durham.

The pair were being tailed by officers after abandoning their Fiat car and trying to flee on foot following a police chase.

But 46-year-old Superintendent Beddow was on hand to help his colleagues and dragged one suspect to the ground by his hood while players helped catch the other man yesterday morning.

Superintendent Beddow, of Durham Police, and who was previously a detective chief inspector in Hartlepool, said: 'I heard the sirens and that alerted me straight away.

'The next thing I know, these two lads are running across the field and one of them ran across the pitch.

'I forgot about the game and grabbed him by the hood and managed to get him down and hold him before the police officers caught up and arrested him.

'It was just instinct really, it's something I've done for years.'

The men were being chased after the car they were travelling in failed to stop for police.

Five men in their late teens and early 20s have been arrested in connection with the incident and were being held in police custody.

Superintendent Beddow, who lives in Hartlepool, said: 'All the players were quite amused.

'They all thought the fact that he'd ran across the pitch was funny.

'He seemed quite young, but he can't have been that quick if I caught him. Credit must go to the players for getting the other guy.'

Superintendent Beddow, a father-of-two, has coached a local youth football team for a number of years and qualified as a referee last year.
