Social media users should compose a ‘famous last Tweet’ to go out after they are dead, according to legal experts.

Although it may sound grim, experts claim the move is only a digital extension of the last requests many people make in a will.

This advice has been given in a new guide from experts SagaLegal.co.uk which advises people on how to sort out their 'digital legacy.'

Social media users should compose a 'famous last Tweet' to go out after they are dead, according to experts

And it includes getting Facebook and Twitter users to prepare their final messages to go out to friends and followers from beyond the grave.

That way, the news will go out far beyond immediate family and friends and could prevent accidental but insensitive messages on a social media page such as birthday greetings from those who did not know.

As well as this, many people have a large online presence that may need to be sorted out once they die, said Sagalegal.co.uk's Digital Legacy Guide.

This can include online subscriptions to clubs, retailers, websites and money being either paid or owed to the deceased from online betting sites and others.

Emma Myers at Saga Legal said: 'In the same way you would not want your loved ones falling out or being inconvenienced over a missing will when you die, it's also imperative to plan ahead for the great internet cafe in the sky'

Millions have accounts with sites like Amazon and others who would keep sending email offers to the address of the deceased unless the accounts are closed.

Emma Myers, head of wills, probate and lifetime planning at Saga Legal said: ‘Being a relatively new invention, there are not yet any substantial legal procedures in place to protect your online presence and even less still when you die.

‘In the same way you would not want your loved ones falling out or being inconvenienced over a missing will when you die, it's also imperative to plan ahead for the great internet cafe in the sky.’

The group is advising the public to compile a secure ‘online directory#, detailing all active internet accounts along with requests for how each should be dealt with.

‘Given how new an invention the internet is, it's perhaps not surprising that many people are not yet familiar with the idea of a digital legacy,’ added Ms Myers.

‘Yet as we continue to live more and more of our lives online, it's become increasingly important to start planning for our virtual afterlife when we pass away.

‘Accounts registered with everything from social media pages, email providers, online retailers and online banking contain sensitive information that should be removed. This is especially true where banking information is involved."

‘With the internet still being somewhat of a legal grey area, we understand the importance of consumers being aware of the risks - emotional, practical and financial - of not properly setting your online affairs in order.’
