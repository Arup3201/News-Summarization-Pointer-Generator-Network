Jamaican lawmakers have announced plans to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana in a move that will pave the way for medicinal use. 

Debate could start before the end of the month in the drug-steeped country where marijuana, known popularly as 'ganja,' has long been culturally entrenched but is illegal.

Following approval by the country's cabinet, Justice Minister Mark Golding said he expects to introduce the legislation in the Senate by the end of this week.

Golding said the bill would establish a 'cannabis licensing authority' to deal with the various regulations needed to cultivate, sell and distribute marijuana for medical, scientific and therapeutic purposes.

'We need to position ourselves to take advantage of the significant economic opportunities offered by this emerging industry,' he said.

It would make possession of 2 ounces or less of the drug a ticketable offense that would not result in a criminal record and growing five or fewer plants on any premises would be permitted.

Rastafarians would also be able to legally use marijuana for religious purposes for the first time in Jamaica, where the spiritual movement was founded in the 1930s.

For decades, debate has raged in Jamaica over relaxing laws prohibiting ganja. But now, with a number of countries and U.S. states relaxing their marijuana laws the Jamaican government is advancing reform plans.

Golding stressed that the government would not soften its stance on transnational drug trafficking and it intends to use a portion of revenues from its new licensing authority to support a public education campaign to discourage pot smoking by youngsters and mitigate public health consequences.

The head of Jamaica's Cannabis Commercial and Medicinal Research Taskforce said he expected the bill to be passed soon in Parliament, where Prime Minister Portia Simpson Miller's governing party holds a 2-1 majority.

'The development is long overdue,' task force director Delano Seiveright said.
