Lord Mandelson, a former Business Secretary, suggests Mr Miliband needs to abandon his 'crowd-pleasing' promises on the cost of living

Labour grandee Lord Mandelson today warns Ed Miliband he needs to get his ‘act together’ if he wants to counter the rise of Ukip and hope to lead more than a ‘minority government’.

The former Business Secretary, one of the founders of New Labour, suggests Mr Miliband needs to abandon his ‘crowd-pleasing’ promises on the cost of living and come up with ‘counter-intuitive policies’ instead.

His intervention, in the Spectator magazine, reflects growing concern in Labour ranks about the party’s economic policy, which has been mocked as ‘the politics of pointing at things and saying how expensive they are’.

Senior figures are also urging Mr Miliband to shift his position on issues such as immigration and an EU referendum – something he has so far refused to do.

There is concern across the party at last week’s local and European election results, which do not suggest it is on course for a majority at next year’s general election.

In town hall elections, Labour made progress in London and some other areas, but finished seven points behind what Neil Kinnock achieved before he lost the 1992 election.

In the European Parliament elections, the party ended up only just over one point ahead of the Conservatives and was soundly beaten by Ukip – the first time for 30 years that an opposition has not come out on top.

Peter Kellner, the head of pollster YouGov, yesterday told a conference organised by Blairite campaign group Progress: ‘On a Government versus opposition basis, I think these figures really are bad for Labour ... Labour should be terrified by these results.

‘I have been on the pessimists’ end of analysts of Labour’s standing and I have to say I thought the vote last week justified the pessimists and did nothing to justify the Labour optimists.’

In his article, Lord Mandelson said it was clear Ukip had had ‘a good week’.

‘The challenge for them is to build a genuine movement beyond a charismatic leader, a band of fruitcake candidates and a clutch of reactionary ideas,’ he added.

‘I doubt they will succeed. In my political career we’ve seen two similar "breakthrough" moments, both in the 1980s: the SDP’s rise and fall, then the Greens coming and going.

‘Those parties’ success was only due to Labour’s weakness. When Labour got its act together, their appeal faded. The same has to happen now, if Labour wants to become more than a minority administration in 2015.

'Douglas Alexander, the party’s election chief, said: "Labour can win the general election if we take the right steps between now and a year’s time."

'The “if” has to include fewer crowd-pleasing cost-of-living promises and more counter-intuitive policies.’

Mr Miliband’s allies dismiss the suggestion that he has been complacent about the rise of Ukip in working class Labour areas – insisting Tony Blair and his ministers are to blame.

One shadow cabinet ally told the left-wing New Statesman magazine: ‘The idea that, suddenly, because of the magic abilities of Farage, Ukip have come out of nowhere to do what they did in the Europeans and the locals is wrong; it’s absurd and incorrect.

‘We’re reaping what we sowed back in ’97 through to 2005, when we gave the impression to our working-class heartlands that they were communities that we took for granted.’

Senior Conservative ministers yesterday held a strategy meeting at Chequers, the Prime Minister’s country residence, to discuss last week’s election results and the Queen’s Speech and the Newark by-election, both due next week.

Though its election results were better than expected, they suggested the party will also struggle to assemble a majority, raising the prospect of another coalition.

The Tories are ‘throwing everything’ at fending off the Ukip threat in the Newark poll, which has been triggered by the resignation of disgraced MP Patrick Mercer.

Mr Cameron has invested great personal capital in the contest, having already made two campaign visits to the constituency himself.
