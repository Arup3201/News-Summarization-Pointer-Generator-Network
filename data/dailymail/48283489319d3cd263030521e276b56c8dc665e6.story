Crystal Palace are allowing Peter Ramage and Paddy McCarthy out on loan.

Ramage, 30, is joining League One Barnsley on a three month deal while central defender McCarthy, 31, is poised to join Sheffield United next week.

Palace manager Neil Warnock said: ‘The problem is you can only have seven substitutes and I like my forwards, I do.

Peter Ramage makes a tackle for Crystal Palace. The 30-year-old is set for a loan move to Barnsley

‘Paddy is like anybody else, he’s very important to the club and I think the club recognises that.

‘That’s why they’ve given him a new contract.

‘If I think he needs games, there have been one or two clubs who have asked me about him. We’ll probably decide on that over the next week whether to loan him out for a few games.’

Paddy McCarthy is 'very important to the club' according to his manager, but will be allowed to leave on loan
