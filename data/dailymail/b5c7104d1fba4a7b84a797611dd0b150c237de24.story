Roberto Martinez has warned the FA over taking Ross Barkley to next summer’s Under 21 European Championship.

The Everton boss has a good relationship with England Under 21 head coach Gareth Southgate but he has also outlined his concerns over whether Barkley has reached a point where that level of football is not suitable for him.

Ross Barkley has only made brief cameos for England since making his debut against Moldova in 2013

Southgate has been told he can have the pick of England’s young stars for the tournament in the Czech Republic next June and it is likely he will include Luke Shaw, John Stones and Calum Chambers in his squad.

There is, however, a debate on Barkley, who has been a fixture in Roy Hodgson’s squads but has not yet nailed down a starting place.

Southgate has never had the chance to pick the Everton midfielder and Martinez is wondering how he intends to handle the gifted 20-year-old.

‘We need to remember what the reason is for playing for the U21s,’ said Martinez. ‘It is to get you ready to play for the first team. The moment that you feel ready to play in the first team, going back in your development, I don’t see how that can help... Ross has gone past that (U21 football) completely.’
