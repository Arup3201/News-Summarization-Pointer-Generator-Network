Imran Khan and his new wife Reham have found themselves at the centre of fresh controversy after a video emerged showing her handling and cooking pork sausages.

In footage shot in 2011 when Mrs Khan was working for BBC South Today, she is shown at a fair in Ardingly, West Sussex, manning a butcher's stall.

Two-time British sausage-making champion David Bell, who owns pork retailer Bangers Galore, then instructs her on the best way to cook pork with her following along.

The clip has been circulated widely on the internet in recent days, and has caused outrage in her conservative Pakistan homeland, where strict Islamic law forbids touching or eating pork. 

Reham Khan, new wife of cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan, has found herself at the centre of fresh controversy in Pakistan after footage has emerged showing her touching and cooking pork

The footage, shot in 2011 while Mrs Khan was working for the BBC, has caused outrage after being circulated online. Strict Islamic law forbids the touching or eating of pork

However Mr Bell told The Times that he coudn't understand the outrage, adding that Reham 'didn't actually eat any of the pork sausages.'

Former cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan has been lambasted in past weeks over his secret wedding to Reham, a former BBC weather girl and current news anchor.

Many conservative Pakistanis believe his marriage to a British-Pakistani divorcee is an unsuitable union for right-winger who has made great play of his Islamic faith.

On a recent visit to the school in Peshawar where 132 children were massacred by the Pakistani Taliban the couple were jeered and had their convoy blocked by protesters chanting 'Go, Imran, go.'

Activists were angered that news of Mr Khan's wedding had occupied a whole day of news coverage in Pakistan, taking attention away from their murdered children.

Some also accused him of staging a media stunt 'to show fake prayers and condolences.'

Mrs Khan worked at BBC South Today as a weather girl before moving back to Pakistan where she now presents a current affairs talk show on the Dawn News channel

The couple married in a small Muslim ceremony on January 8, causing outcry among Pakistan's conservative population who believed divorced mother-of-three Reham is a poor match for the politician

Rumours of a wedding have been circulating on social media for months, with users attacking Mrs Khan for her western lifestyle, including going to parties and dancing with unknown men in public

Mr Khan leads the Tehreek-e-Insaf party, which holds the third largest bloc of seats in the country's parliament and had previously spoken of challenging for the Pakistani presidency.

But his public standing has been badly damaged since he wed Reham in his home of Islamabad on January 8 during a private ceremony to which none of his family were invited.

Rumours of a marriage had been circulating for weeks online, with many expressing dismay at his choice of bride. Mr Khan initially tried to distance himself, saying news of a wedding was 'greatly exaggerated.'

A Facebook hate-group has been attacking Mrs Khan since 2011, posting images of her at parties, wearing short skirts and dancing with men in public.

The couple were booed and jeered by angry crowds when they visited the school in Peshawar yesterday where 132 children were massacred by the Pakistani Taliban a month previously

Crowds angry that news of the Khans' wedding had diverted a day of news coverage away from their murdered children chanted 'Go, Imran, go' and tried to block his motorcade

One post accused Mrs Khan of being a 'lesbian' because she was pictured with her hand on another woman's bare back at a party.

In separate message the page's creator accused Mrs Khan's daughter of being a 'pornstar', claiming to have found topless modelling shots of her.

Gossip began in October after Imran's ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith revealed she was ditching the surname ‘Khan’ and reverting to her family name because her ex-husband was about to remarry.

She said at the time: ‘My ex-husband, Imran, recently announced that he intended to get remarried soon, which made me think it’s probably time to change my name back to Goldsmith.’
