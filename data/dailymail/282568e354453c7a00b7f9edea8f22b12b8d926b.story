Tiger Woods has announced Chris Como as his latest swing coach, filling a vacancy created by his split from Sean Foley in August.

At 36, Como is two years Woods' junior and will initially work with the former world No 1 on a consultant basis. He has previously worked with Australian professional Aaron Baddeley on his swing.

Tiger Woods last played at the US PGA Championship and has appointed Chris Como as a new swing coach

Woods wrote on Twitter: 'Happy to have Chris Como consulting and working with me on my swing. I'm excited to be back competing.'

Woods, who last played at the US PGA Championship, is expected to return to action at the Hero World Challenge from December 4 which he will host at Isleworth Golf & Country Club in Florida.
