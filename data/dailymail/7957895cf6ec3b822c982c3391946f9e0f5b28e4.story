Alastair Cook has called for cricket authorities and helmet manufacturers to continue to work tirelessly on player safety following the tragic death of Phillip Hughes.

A sombre-looking Cook made his plea in Colombo the day after the Australian batsman died from a blow to an unprotected part of his head, below the left ear, which he received during a domestic match in Sydney on Tuesday.

The England squad joined in with a Twitter-led initiative, hashtagged ‘putoutyourbats’, in honour of Hughes. They lined up their bats after a training session at the R Premadasa Stadium ahead of this morning’s second one-day international against Sri Lanka, and placed one navy blue Test cap on each handle.

‘We should keep working as hard as we can, through the manufacturers and the authorities, to make cricket as safe as possible,’ said Cook. ‘This is a reminder to everyone that we can’t take anything for granted. We’ve got to keep improving player safety, even though improvements since I started playing cricket have gone through the roof, especially with helmets.’

Helmet safety has been a pressing issue in the game ever since 2008, when the ECB’s injury surveillance programme looked into head injuries incurred by batsmen wearing helmets.

Of 35 verifiable incidents around the world between 2003 and 2012, six batsmen were struck on the back of the helmet, and two more — like Hughes — on the unguarded part of the neck or lower head. Most helmet safety tests have focused on preventing the ball from penetrating the gap between the helmet’s peak and its grille, or ensuring the grille doesn’t impact on the face after being struck by the ball.

But Cricket Australia have launched an investigation into player safety, while Sri Lanka’s veteran batsman Kumar Sangakkara told Sportsmail: ‘The helmet should be longer at the back to protect vital areas of the head and balance both freedom of movement and safety. It needs to be as safe as possible. I’m sure the ICC as a governing body can step in to ensure safer equipment standards.’

Sangakkara said he had spent time looking online at protective headgear in other sports, including American football.

The ICC declined to comment on the issue, but research into player attitudes has suggested that not all of them are keen to embrace the new, safer models. Reasons for this vary: the older models tend to be lighter, while the players believe they offer better visibility. They may even feel more comfortable in a helmet they have worn for longer.

Privately, some within the England camp are also concerned that extending the helmet to cover sensitive areas at the back of the head would curtail their freedom of movement. England and Sri Lanka discussed postponing today’s match — the second in a series of seven — but Cook said: ‘We thought showing respect and playing the game in his honour was the right thing to do.’

The England squad have, understandably, found it tough to focus on cricket since news came through that Hughes had died, and Cook admitted that today’s game would inevitably be played at a lower level of intensity.

But he insisted it would be wrong for fast bowlers to hold back on bouncers in the wake of the short ball delivered to Hughes by New South Wales seamer Sean Abbott.

‘This is a tragic accident,’ said Cook. ‘I don’t think we should change the way cricket is played. If you’re going to play a game, you’ve got to do it properly. What’s happened in the last three days has certainly clarified in my mind that it’s just a game of sport.

‘We are incredibly lucky to play the game and we have a massive responsibility to play it the right way. We play it hard, yes, because you’re representing your country, but there’s certainly a right way to do it.’

Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews said he and his team had been ‘deeply shocked’ by Hughes’s death.

‘It was the first thing I heard when I woke up yesterday. It was a very tough day,’ he said.

‘It will be very hard to get over this — for all of us, not just Australian cricket. He was a humble guy and a gentleman.’
