He is the world’s best-paid athlete and Floyd Mayweather certainly knows how to spend his hard-earned wealth.

The pound-for-pound boxing king, who earned £66.1million according to Forbes magazine last year, posted a tantalising picture of what you can buy when money is no object.

Mayweather posted a snap online of himself in front of a fleet of luxury cars, as well as his own private jet, and wrote: 'Welcome to my toy world! Who wants to come out and play?'

The collection included two different Bugatti Veyrons, a Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport, two Ferrari 458 Spiders, a Lamborghini Aventador, a Porsche 911 Turbo S and a Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano.  

The fastest car on show was the Bugatti Veyron, which has a top speed of 267mph. The Bugatti cars are also the most expensive, coming in at around £1.5m each, while the cheapest is the Porshe 911 – a bargain at £150,000. 

The total cost of vehicles on show reaches a staggering £5.55m, and that's before the price of the plane is included.

This particular Bugatti is worth £1.5million and forms part of Mayweather's astonishing fleet of wheels 

Mayweather has never been shy of flaunting his wealth, but has run into trouble with the law over the last 13 years

This isn't the first time the 37-year-old has taken to social media to brag about his wealth. He recently posted photos online of his collections of shoes, sunglasses and watches.

Away from the boxing ring and the cars, Mayweather has colourful and often controversial past.

In 2002, he was charged with two counts of domestic violence and received a six-month suspended sentence, while two years later he was again on the wrong side of the law - handed a one-year suspended sentence for battery of two women.

Another suspended sentence followed 12 months later, this time for 90 days. 

Mayweather did spend time in prison in 2011, however, when found guilty of battery against his ex-girlfriend. He was behind bars for 90 days.  

One man who isn't impressed with Mayweather's latest act of ostentation is his great rival Manny Pacquiao. 

The 36-year-old Filipino, who has been attempting to arrange a fight with Mayweather for years, said on Monday: 'Floyd brags about his lifestyle and everything! I don't care! I'm just waiting here for him to sign the contract!'

If the fight does happen, both boxers will find themselves in line for their greatest ever financial windfalls, with some predicting the bout could be worth as much as $250m (£163m).

Mayweather also bought 15-year-old son Koraun a Bentley golf cart for his birthday in November, posting: 'My son @kingkoraun wanted a Bentley golf cart for his 15th birthday so I made it appear. Stay on the look out for his gift for his 16th birthday!' 

That came just days after Mayweather had uploaded a photo of stacks of $100 bills on his table and before that similar amounts in bed with him. 

Manny Pacquiao posted this picture online on Monday and said he didn't care about Mayweather's money - he just wanted a fight
