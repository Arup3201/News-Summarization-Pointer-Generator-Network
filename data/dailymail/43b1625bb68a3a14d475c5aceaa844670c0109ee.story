John Lennon’s killer is up for parole again and for the eighth time the late singer's wife, Yoko Ono, is fighting to keep him behind bars.

Mark David Chapman, who is serving a 20 year-to-life sentence,  was interviewed by state parole officials this week and a decision on his release is expected as early as next week.

Chapman, who shot the Beatle on December 8, 1980, has had a clean prison record since 1994 but is not expected to be released.

If unsuccessful, the 59-year-old will have to wait another two years before he is again eligible for parole.

Ms Ono opposed Chapman's release, according to the New York Daily News, arguing that it would endanger her and Lennon's two sons.

She also said Chapman was at risk of retribution attacks from fans.

Chapman has previously said he targeted the singer because of his fame and because he thought he was a phoney for living a life of luxury.

He killed Lennon, 40, as the singer and Ms Ono returned home after a recording session.

Chapman is reportedly kept in protective custody and is only allowed out of his cell for three hours a day.

He has conjugal visits with his wife, Gloria Chapman, who he married before committing the murder.
