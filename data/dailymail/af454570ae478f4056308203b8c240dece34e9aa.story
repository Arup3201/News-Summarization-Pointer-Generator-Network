Cheering on the Three Lions: England fans gather in Manaus to support their team

Managers: Roy Hodgson (England)Cesare Prandelli (Italy)Key clash: Steven Gerrard v Daniele De Rossi

Before their last meeting at Euro 2012 De Rossi described the England captain as his ‘idol’ but it was Italy who were the victors that day, winning 4-2 on penalties after extra time. The two midfielders, both of whom have spent their whole careers at their home-town club (Liverpool and Roma), will go into battle once more on Saturday, determined to inspire their sides to victory.

One to watch: Andrea Pirlo (Italy)And why wouldn’t you? The Italy midfielder was sent to the scrap heap by AC Milan three years ago, where Juventus carefully picked him up and instantly made him the focal point of their team. Three consecutive Serie A titles later Pirlo is still going strong, and when these two sides met in 2012 he was England’s chief tormenter. Expect more of the same in Manaus. Head-to-head record: Played 24 England Wins 8 Draws 7 Wins 9

Key to success: Andrea Pirlo (left) will hope to pull the creative strings for Italy from midfield
