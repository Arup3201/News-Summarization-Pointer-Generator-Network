Convicted Australian terrorist, Khaled Sharrouf was involved in an underworld scuffle over $9 million alongside some of Sydney's most violent criminals before fleeing to Syria to fight with the outlawed extremist group, the Islamic State.

Sharrouf, the father behind the circulation of an image of his son holding a severed head, is wanted by the Australian Federal Police for alleged terrorist activities in the Middle East after he fled the country in December on his brother's passport.

He had been working alongside bikies, drug dealers and other crime figures as well as business identity George Alex before leaving the country, Fairfax has revealed.

Sharrouf’s departure is suspected to have been prompted by the murder of debt collector Vasko Boskovski who he had been working with alongside Alex to retrieve an alleged $9 million debt from the property developer Meriton, according to a Fairfax investigation.

Boskovski was killed after Sharrouf’s group butted-heads with another underworld group who claimed they were entitled to the $9 million, forcing both Sharrouf and Alex into hiding as they feared for their lives.

Fairfax also revealed that Sharrouf first started associating with Alex after serving his jail sentence in 2005 at Goulburn and Lithgow prisons for his part in Operation Pendennis - a terrorist cell that operated in Melbourne and Sydney and was planning an Australian attack.

Earlier this month he posted a photo on Twitter of his son holding up a severed head, along with a caption: 'Thats my boy!'

Alex and his counterparts were said to have secured a house for Sharif and his family after his release and in exchange, the jihadist ran errands for them which included collecting their debts.

Since departing Australia, Sharrouf has been using his social media pages to boast about the Islamic State group.

Earlier this month he posted a photo on Twitter of his son holding up a severed head, along with a caption: 'Thats my boy!'

It was accompanied by a photo of Sharrouf himself holding the same head, written with the words: 'What a head', and another of him and three young boys brandishing rifles.

In 2005, psychiatrist Olav Nielssen - a renowned psychiatrist who sits on the NSW Mental Health Review Tribunal - assessed Sharrouf's condition and discovered the jihadist had depression, acute schizophrenia, paranoia and had suffered from hallucinations for a number of years, with signs of mental illness showing as early as the 1990s.

A judge residing over Sharrouf's case had said his mental issues had driven him to jihad and pushed him towards extremism.
