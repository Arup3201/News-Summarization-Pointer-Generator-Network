They were the remarkable creations that dazzled the ancients.

But in modern Britain, one in ten people cannot name a single one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

Some 61 per cent managed to name one – usually the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt – according to a survey.

The Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, built between 2584 and 2561 BC was the one ancient wonder of the world most Britons were able to name

A paltry 21 per cent were capable of 
coming up with a second and 12 per cent could not name any at all. Only 6
 per cent of Britons can name them all.

However,
 it is probably not surprising that many are left flummoxed as most of 
the sites were destroyed by earthquakes and only the Great Pyramid of 
Giza still stands.
