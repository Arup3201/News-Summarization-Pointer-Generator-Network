A deaf boy believed to be 11 years old went on an overnight joyride in his mom's car, driving 20 miles through Oklahoma City before crashing into a curb.

The boy snuck out of his home in Moore, in the southwest end of the city, only to end up on the northwest end at about 5.30am. 

When a driver spotted the boy, who has not been named, running around and the 2012 Kia sedan crashed into bushes, he called 911.

An deaf boy believed to be 11 years old went on a 20-mile in his mom's car that ended when he crashed into a curb on the northwest end of Oklahoma City

Police said that the boy snuck out of his house while his parents were sleeping and found himself 20 miles away at 5.30am

Because the boy has a hearing impairment, police had trouble communicating with him. They are unsure as to what his exact route was

To call it a crash, however, would 'almost be an overstatement', Oklahoma City Police Sgt. Gary Knight told the New York Daily News.  

There was minimal damage to the car, and the boy simply 'drove up the curb and bumped into decorative rocks', the sergeant said. 

Police said that the boy was not injured and he was standing next to the car when officers arrived. 

He would have been driving for approximately 25 minutes to end up where he did, according to New York Daily News, but police told KWTV that they are unsure as to what route he took.

Police did, however, find out contact information for the boy's parents. His mother (pictured right) spoke in sign language to her son at the scene

Police said that calling it a crash was 'almost be an overstatement', as he only hit decorative rocks and was not injured

Police had trouble communicating with the boy because of his disability, and at one point they were using hand-written notes to converse. 

When his parents arrived on scene they communicated through sign language. 

His mother said that her son had a learning disability and wasn't aware of the danger he was putting himself and others in, according to KWTV. 

The boy went home with his parents on Thursday. Police are not investigating for signs of abuse or neglect.
