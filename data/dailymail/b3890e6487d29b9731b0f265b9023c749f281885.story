David Evans, owner of the veterinary practice where Ms Gowing has been based for 18 months, said staff became worried after receiving the text at the weekend.

'One of the nurses was concerned about her on Saturday or Sunday because she had half a message from her, from her mobile phone anyway,' Mr Evans said.

'We thought, since her car was missing, we thought maybe she had gone somewhere for the weekend or got into some difficulty or something like that.'

Ms Gowing is known to have missed a weekend appointment but the alarm was not raised until Monday morning when she failed to arrive at work.

'We informed the police as soon as she did not turn up for work at 9 o’clock on Monday morning. Then we left it to the police,' Mr Evans added.

A 46-year-old man from Gwynedd remains in police custody on suspicion of murder following the 37-year-old’s disappearance.

Magistrates in Prestatyn granted officers a 36-hour extension this morning to question the suspect.

The man in custody is known to frequent the New Brighton area and is known to Ms Gowing.

North Wales Police revealed that detectives have established a further sighting of Ms Gowing at a supermarket after she left the veterinary surgery in Clayton Road, Mold, at about 7pm.

She was last seen at Asda in Queensferry at 8.06pm on Friday and left at 8.39pm.

She was wearing blue jeans, a light brown/khaki zip-up fleece top with white sleeves and white side panels, and plain black flat shoes. Her brown hair was tied up.

Ms Gowing was also carrying a bright brown saddle bag over her shoulder and across her body and was carrying an Asda plastic bag and a pizza-type box.

Detective Superintendent John Hanson said: Our priority is to trace Catherine and we would urge anyone who has seen her or her Renault Clio, bearing the Irish registration plates 00D 99970, to contact the North Wales Police incident room on 101.

This is totally out of character for Catherine and the public’s assistance in the search cannot be emphasised enough.'

Paying
tribute to her, Mr Evans told RTE that Ms Gowing did a great job for 
him and got on well with clients once she settled in.She
was a very caring, dear person, really, very willing and very easy to 
get on with,' he said. She was such a pleasant girl, really.'

Ms
Gowing had been working at the Evans practice for about 18 months after
being recommended by an Irish friend who was also working there.

'Mold is not a very big town. It’s 
very rare you’d get any problems in the town, really. This has taken 
everybody by surprise,' Mr Evans said.

'It’s
devastating. They (surgery staff) are all devastated, really. She was 
very popular not only with clients but with the staff. She never fell 
out with anybody.'

Police
believe that, after finishing work, Ms Gowing drove home to Cae Isa, 
New Brighton, in her work car, a Vauxhall Corsa, which has been 
recovered.

Ms Gowing is about 5ft 10in and of slim, athletic build. She speaks with an Irish accent.Her sister and brother-in-law, Shay, who live in Ireland.

At the press conference today, Ms Gowing’s sister Emma said: We are all so deeply shocked by the events that have unfolded in the last four days. Catherine’s disappearance has left us all bereft. We are lost without her.

'We are desperate to hear any news of Catherine’s whereabouts.'

She added: I’d implore the local community to do all they can and help us find her.

Look out of your windows, look as you drive or head to work. Check your local street, car parks, garages, wasteland or anywhere a car may be left.'

Detective Superintendent John Hanson said: Although I am not in a position at this time to discuss in detail the exact nature of our inquiries, I can provide a brief summary of the activity we are conducting as part of this investigation.

Co-ordinated searches continue at various locations in an attempt to find Catherine, her vehicle and personal items that appear to be missing from her home.

A forensic examination continues at Catherine’s home address and we continue to seize and view CCTV footage which may give us an indication as to her whereabouts.

I would again like to emphasise the assistance the public can provide in helping us to find Catherine by looking for her plum/burgundy Renault Clio that has not been seen since Friday evening.'
