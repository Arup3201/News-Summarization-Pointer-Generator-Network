A new city could be built in the Midlands alongside the controversial High Speed 2 rail line as part of a drive to tackle the country’s housing shortage.

The transport project’s chief engineer said up to 100,000 homes could be built on green belt land.

Details emerged as ministers prepare to launch a radical National Planning Policy Framework to simplify planning laws and boost economic growth.

If the plan, backed by HS2’s chief engineer Andrew McNaughton, goes ahead, it would concrete over the open countryside between Birmingham and Coventry.

This would create the country’s largest conurbation, stretching from Coventry in the east to Wolverhampton in the west.

The city would be part of a growth spurt expected over the coming years, which could see as many as two million new homes by 2020.

Most of the growth is predicted by the Office for National Statistics to take place outside the major cities and would see England’s population go up by 4.4million.

Some 59,000 new homes would be needed in Essex; 55,000 in Kent; 49,000 in Hertfordshire; 37,000 in Lincolnshire and 26,000 in Cambridgeshire.

Rural towns in the east of England and the Midlands will see the most rapid population growth. Boston, Corby and  Northampton are all set to grow  by between 17 and 19 per cent  by 2020.

Last week David Cameron said he wanted to see a series of new ‘garden cities’, together with increased airport capacity. He warned: ‘We urgently need to find places where we’re prepared to allow significant new growth to happen.’

A senior Downing Street source described the new planning framework as an ‘unashamedly pro-growth document. It is still the most radical business deregulation there has ever been’.

But the source added: ‘These reforms were never intended to allow the concreting over of the countryside.’

Professor McNaughton outlined his vision for a new Midlands city in a speech in Derby.

He said there could also be a ‘second Docklands’ to the west of London, and called for an expansion of Birmingham Airport. Joe Rukin, the co-ordinator of the Stop HS2 campaign, said: ‘We have always suspected that HS2 is really a developers’ charter.

‘We have been saying for almost two years that if HS2 goes ahead, that would mean the destruction of the green belt which separates Birmingham and Coventry.’

In an article for the Countryside Alliance magazine, Mr Cameron attempted to dampen down the planning row by declaring: ‘The countryside is in my blood. For me, our countryside is what makes Britain great.’

Ministers are to strengthen the legal protection of school playing fields. Hundreds have been sold for housing over the past decade, often leaving communities with no sports provision. Planning guidance will say permission should never be given to build on playing fields unless the development provides alternative sports and recreation.
