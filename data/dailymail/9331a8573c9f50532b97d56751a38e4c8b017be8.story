The doting grandfather who was accompanying his three grandchildren home to Perth from a holiday of a lifetime in Europe when their flight, MH17, was shot down on the Russian-Ukraine border joked about flying Malaysia Airlines before he boarded the doomed plane.

Nick Norris, 67, referenced flight MH370 which went missing in March before he flew on MH17 on Thursday, his daughter Natalia Gemmell revealed as she paid tribute to her father on Friday.

'I spoke to him just before he caught the plane to find out when he was leaving and told him I loved him and told him I’d see him when he got back,' she told PerthNow.

Mr Norris was a man with a passion for family and died with his three grandchildren doing what he loved best - a good turn for his kids, his friend told Daily Mail Australia.

The family were among the 298 people on board the Malaysia Airlines plane, which departed from Amsterdam.

Mr Norris had taken his three grandchildren, Mo, 12, Evie, 10, and Otis Maslin, eight, over to Europe so that they could join their parents, Mr Norris’s daughter Rin Norris and her partner Anthony Maslin for a holiday.

After the three generations of the family had toured Europe for several weeks, Mr Norris was bringing his three grandkids back home to Perth in time for the start of school when they boarded the doomed flight.

However, the parents had remained in Amsterdam for a few extra days. They were in the Dutch city as the tragic news broke.

'In my mind he was a very great man; he has been a Lieutenant Colonel in the Army Reserves; he’s been a headmaster; he’s been a consultant with Indigenous people with education and he has done his bit to change his part of the world,' Mrs Gemmell said of her father.

'My father was in the army. My father was in wars, for him to be shot down in a war that wasn’t his...' she added.

She described her nephews and niece as 'beautiful, beautiful kids, just gentle clever beautiful kids'.

Mr Norris’s son Brack, 24, paid tribute to his father, niece and nephews. 

'I’m a bit dizzy right now,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Brack told the ABC he couldn't believe the news when he first found out.

'I thought it was just ridiculous but yes, it's clearly not,' he said.

'I loved my dad extraordinarily and they were amazing kids.

'They were very intelligent kids and they loved doing their sports, like surfing and that kind of thing,' he added.

A long-time friend and business partner of Mr Norris, Dave Goddard, paid tribute to his friend who he described as a ‘great raconteur, a great enthusiast and a man with a passion for family’.

'Nick had four virtues,' Mr Goddard said.

'He had impeccable integrity, he had a desire to create a more just world and to help people help themselves.

'He was committed to human beings irrespective of their race, creed or colour and he loved his kids and his grandkids very much.'

Mr Goddard had known Mr Norris for 50 years and had been in business with him for two decades in a company they established, Collaborative Systemic Change.

The company worked to establish 'opportunity and responsibility' in Aboriginal communities with a programme they called 'Walking Together'.

'He was a very gregarious man, a great enthusiast with a real desire to help people take responsibility,' Mr Goddard said. 'I will miss him.'

'Dear friends please pray for my most beautiful dearest girlfriend and her family after their loss this morning xxx may God be with you xxx love you guys so much - my love to all of you,' Bec Bucci - a friend of the family - posted on Facebook.

Mr Norris, the managing director of management consulting firm Collaborative Systemic Change Pty Ltd, is survived by his son Brack, who is the company's marketing manager, and daughter Kirstin, a marine engineer with the Royal Australian Navy.

He was a well-known member of the South Perth Yacht Club.

The Boeing 777 aircraft was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was hit by a sophisticated surface-to-air missile over territory near Donetsk held by pro-Russian rebels who the Ukrainian government says are backed by the Kremlin.

The plane was shot down in an 'act of terrorism', killing all 298 passengers and crew on board including 28 Australians.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed Ukraine for the tragedy.

Malaysia Airlines has confirmed that 154 Dutch, 43 Malaysian (including 15 crew and two infants), 12 Indonesian, nine British, four German, three Filipino, and one Canadian citizen were also on the plane.

The airline added that all European flights operated by Malaysia Airlines will now be taking alternative routes, avoiding the usual route over Ukraine.
