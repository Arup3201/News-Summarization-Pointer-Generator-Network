Burnley vs Queens Park Rangers (Turf Moor) 

Team news

Burnley

Burnley captain Jason Shackell could be back in contention for Saturday's Barclays Premier League clash with QPR at Turf Moor after a calf injury.

The centre-back's return would ease defensive problems following the loss of Kevin Long, who has had successful anterior cruciate ligament surgery this week, and with Michael Duff (calf) probably not quite ready for action.

David Jones is fit after a bout of sickness this week but fellow midfielder Matt Taylor (achilles) and defender Stephen Ward (ankle) remain on the sidelines.

Provisional squad: Heaton, Cisak, Gilks, Trippier, Mee, Keane, Shackell, Lafferty, Arfield, Marney, Boyd, Jones, Wallace, Kightly, Barnes, Vokes, Ings, Sordell, O'Neill, Reid, Jutkiewicz.

QPR

On-loan West Ham striker Mauro Zarate is expected to make his QPR debut in Saturday's Barclays Premier League trip to Burnley.

Rangers boss Harry Redknapp cannot yet call on Sandro, with the Brazil midfielder still several weeks away from fitness.
