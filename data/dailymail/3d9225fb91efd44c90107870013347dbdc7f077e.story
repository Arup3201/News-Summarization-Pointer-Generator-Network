They could be strike partners for England next month and, at this rate, for some years to come. On Tuesday night, however, Daniel Sturridge and Harry Kane found themselves on opposing teams with very different goals in mind.

The shootout between two of England's most prolific marksmen became a focal point for what was otherwise a breathless, exhilarating encounter featuring two teams built to attack.

Roy Hodgson will have been as interested a spectator as anyone as he weighs up his options for the forthcoming Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on March 27 and the friendly with Italy four days later.

Kane arrived on Merseyside on Tuesday night having just upstaged two of his rivals for an England place; 10 days earlier he had scored twice at the Hawthorns to overshadow West Brom's Saido Berahino.

Then on Saturday, of course, came that double in the North London derby at White Hart Lane to eclipse Danny Welbeck and give Spurs a memorable victory over Arsenal.

Tuesday night was arguably an even tougher proposition. Sturridge might have missed the majority of the season with a combination of thigh and calf injuries, but he remains England's pre-eminent striker and the one most likely to be first on Roy Hodgson's teamsheet when fully fit.

Coincidentally, the two men had an identical record of 15 goals from their last 20 Premier League starts.

Kane got another one on Tuesday night and has now scored all of his 13 Premier League goals since November, while Sturridge's injury issues inevitably meant that his record stretched back well into last season when he formed a prolific partnership with Luis Suarez.

In fact, Tuesday night was his first start since last August and a 3-0 win over Tottenham at a time when Kane was only considered good enough for the substitutes' bench. How things have changed.

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has no doubt that Kane is worthy of his first senior England call-up after eight goals in 10 internationals for the Under-21s, but had said on the eve of this game that 'as an English striker there's no-one better than' Sturridge.

'For me, Daniel clearly has everything as a top European striker,' Rodgers said before kick-off last night. 'If we can get him on the field regularly now he will show that.

Sturridge was making his first start for Liverpool since last August following an injury-ravaged season 

'But it's brilliant for young Harry Kane seeing him as a young player coming through the system. He's a terrific talent and it shows you that, given the opportunity, a homegrown player can come in and do very well. I'm delighted to see him do that and I hope it will continue after tonight.'

It's hard to see how Hodgson can ignore Kane now. The Tottenham man continued his remarkable run of form by scoring the first-half equaliser that takes his total in all competitions to 23 by mid January. No Premier League striker has scored more.

It was another well-taken goal by the 21-year-old who managed to re-arrange his feet to take Erik Lamela's pass in the 26th minute when Mamadou Sakho was falling over his.

Once again, Kane went for power rather than precision, and Simon Mignolet just couldn't keep it out.

He then helped set up Tottenham's second equaliser for Moussa Dembele and, on that basis, you would have to say that he just about shaded the duel with Sturridge.

The Liverpool striker is not one to be easily outdone, however.

In his defence, Sturridge is getting back to full fitness. He was still enough of a handful to win the penalty that enabled Steven Gerrard to restore Liverpool's lead early in the second half when Sturridge's jinking run invited a clumsy challenge from Danny Rose.

Both he and Kane are clearly high on confidence. Kane tried his luck with an effort from the half way line in the first half, while Sturridge sent an audacious backheel against the post.

Hugo Lloris made two saves from Sturridge in the early stages and was relieved to see Eric Dier recover to deny the former Chelsea striker with a magnificent block after Nabil Bentaleb contributed to a catalogue of defensive errors by Tottenham with an awful pass.

Dier then produced another fantastic tackle on Sturridge in the second half when Liverpool fans were screaming for a second penalty.

By the end, they had to be happy with a point. Kane and Sturridge had both made theirs.
