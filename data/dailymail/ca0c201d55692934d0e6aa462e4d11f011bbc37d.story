No trip to Thailand would be complete without a picture of an elephant... unless of course you can get one by an elephant.

This art-loving pachyderm with a penchant for Picasso has wowed audiences with its portfolio of paintings all created using just a brush and its trunk.

The Asian elephant is one of a herd the mighty beasts who while away their days painting still lifes at the Thai Elephant Conservation Center in Lampang, northern Thailand.

A video released by website Travel For Kids shows the elephant methodically painting a red-rose bush as awestruck sightseers look on.

Scroll down for video.

Mighty skill: The Asian elephant is one of a herd the mighty beasts who while away their days painting still lifes

Raw talent: The still life is probably better-painted than that which most humans could produce

She begins by carefully outlining the stems before painting the flowers, petal by petal, under the watchful eye of one of the park's trainers.

According to its website, the TECC is 'a cornerstone in the evolution of elephant painting'.

In 1997, two American artists supervised the first artworks painted by elephants ever done in Thailand.

Since then, the center claims, 'many Thai elephant camps have started painting with their animals as a harmless way to increase revenue while entertaining guests'.

But art is not the elephants' only talent. The center also supervised the world's only elephant orchestra where 'many as 14 elephants have played together on one song'.

The orchestra has even released a CD of its music.
