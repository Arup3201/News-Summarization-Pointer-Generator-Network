Hewlett-Packard (HP) is recalling more than six million notebook computer AC power cords around the world due to an overheating issue.

The problem affects HP and Compaq notebooks bought between September 2010 and June 2012, with affected devices apparently a potential fire hazard.

Owners of a laptop from this period can request a replacement power cord from HP's website.

California-based HP is sending out replacement AC power cords (shown) to customers who bought a HP or Compaq notebook from Sept 2010 to June 2012. Affected consumers can request a new power cord on HP's website. An issue can apparently cause older cables to overheat or catch fire

The company is recalling about 5.6 million notebook computer AC power cords in the US and another 446,700 in Canada due to the issue.

So far HP has received 29 reports of power cords overheating and melting or charring, resulting in two claims of minor burns and 13 claims of minor property damage.

'On August 26, 2014 HP announced a worldwide voluntary recall and replacement program in cooperation with various government regulatory agencies, for affected AC power cords distributed worldwide with HP and Compaq notebook and mini notebook computers, as well as with AC adapters provided with accessories such as docking stations, sold from September 2010 through June 2012.

'HP customers affected by this program will be eligible to receive a replacement AC power cord for each verified, recalled AC power cord at no cost.

'HP believes that certain power cords shipped with notebook PC products and AC adapter accessories may pose a risk of a fire and burn hazard to customers. We are taking this action as part of our commitment to provide the highest quality of service to our notebook customers.'

The Hewlett-Packard LS-15 AC power cords were distributed with HP and Compaq notebook and mini notebook computers, and with AC adapter-powered accessories including docking stations.

The power cords manufactured in China are black and have an 'LS-15' molded on the AC adapter end of the cord.

The notebook and mini-notebook computers and accessories were sold with the AC power cords at computer and electronics stores, authorised dealers and online at HP's website.

The company has advised consumers to immediately stop using and unplug the recalled power cords and contact them via their website to order a free replacement.

Consumers can continue using the computers on battery power.
