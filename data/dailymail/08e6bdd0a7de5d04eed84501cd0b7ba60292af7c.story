Notorious prisoner Charles Bronson has been moved to a different prison after allegedly attacking a prison governor, it has been claimed

Notorious prisoner Charles Bronson has been moved to a different prison and put in a 'punishment cell' after allegedly attacking a prison governor.

The 61-year-old was moved to HMP Woodhill, in Buckinghamshire, just before Christmas last year.

But he was moved to HMP Wakefield, in West Yorkshire, on Friday after being accused of assaulting a governor at Woodhill, it has been reported.

Bronson, who is serving a life sentence for robbery and kidnap, was last week apparently banned from sending out his artwork after prison chiefs at Woodhill said people on the outside were selling it for profit.

He has spent 40 years in jail, 36 in solitary, since first being jailed for armed robbery in 1974.

He is now in a 'punishment cell' at Wakefield, according to the website of campaign group The Charlie Bronson Appeal Fund.

The website claims: 'Woodhil Prison (sic) are alleging that Charlie assaulted a Governor and made threats and have charged him and passed the matter to the police to investigate.

'Charlie's legal team have been made aware of the situation and Charlie fully intends to fight these accusations, citing extreme provocation and duress.'

The website also says it has received confirmation from Bronson, who has been dubbed the UK's most violent inmate, that he is back at Wakefield where he was allowed to make an emergency phone call.

It says: 'He is, however in the 
punishment block and at present, unsure how long he will be in 
punishment or indeed, at Wakefield.

'There is apparently no cell on the CSC unit so the next few days are full of uncertainty in terms of his location.

'The protocol on the punishment block is that unless he is prepared to come out with his hands on his head and get on his knees, they will not let him out for the hour's exercise he is legally entitled to.

'Charlie has refused to do this, although he is keen to stress that he is cool and being respectful to the staff at Wakefield.

'Charlie has nothing in the punishment cell, and has not the opportunity to wash or shave since Friday. We are hopeful this situation will change for the better within the next few days.'

Bronson, who has won 11 awards from the Koestler Trust - a prison arts charity - for his drawings and has shows in galleries across London and the south east, has been in solitary for 36 years.

He has convictions for wounding, criminal damage, GBH, false imprisonment and blackmail.

The Ministry of Justice has said it does not comment on individual prisoners.
