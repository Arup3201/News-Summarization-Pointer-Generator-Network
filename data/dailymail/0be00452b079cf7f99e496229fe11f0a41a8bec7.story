Coneygree became the first novice to strike for 41 years when making most of the running in the Betfred Cheltenham Gold Cup.

The eight-year-old, trained by Mark Bradstock and ridden by Nico de Boinville, took the blue riband prize of steeplechasing on only his fourth race over fences.

The success fully vindicated the decision to bypass the RSA Chase earlier in the week and run in the Gold Cup instead.

Coneygree (right) did just enough to beat Djakadam and Road To Riches in a thrilling finish 

Coneygree (7-1) held on up the hill by a length and a half from Djakadam (10-1), with Road To Riches (8-1) two lengths away in third. 

De Boinville said: 'It's the best feeling ever, I'm lost for words.

'I never thought they shouldn't have run in this, it was a great plan.

'The weather gods were looking down on us and the ground was ideal.

'He's so deceptive, even when he gets in tight he's brilliant, it's all thanks to the Bradstock family, it's a great family effort.

'I must thank the owners and the Bradstocks for keeping the faith in me. These horses only come once in a lifetime.'

Sara Bradstock, wife of the winning trainer and daughter of the late Lord Oaksey, who bred Coneygree, said: 'He (Lord Oaksey) is not here, but he's here in spirit.

'I'd been saying to people, when we win the Gold Cup we'll win the lottery, it's that amazing.'

'It's only his fourth run over fences, but he had so much time off and he's wise in his own way.'

Lady Oaksey said: 'I've been asking myself what decision would John (Oaksey) have made? As it turned out, it was a very good decision after looking at Vautour and Don Poli (in the novice chases).

'To win this now - you dream and it's absolutely amazing.'

It was the 19-times champion's final ride in the Gold Cup before his retirement 

Mrs Bradstock added: 'All the people quoted stats at us, but this horse knows how to jump and how to gallop and he showed them.

'We were forecast real rain, which made the decision for us, and it was an open Gold Cup.

'It's so unbelievable, I've been in the yard from 6am until 10pm and it's all for this.

'All the big yards spend telephone numbers on horses and our mare cost £3,000.

'People were asking after Newbury (when Richard Johnson rode in the Denman Chase) if Nico would get the ride back, but of course he would - he rides him beautifully, he'll be a great jockey.

'It's a little bit back to work later as my favourite person, Carruthers, runs tomorrow (at Uttoxeter), but I might not be at my best!

'It shows anyone can do it, you don't need millions

'He didn't know he's a novice.'

The winning trainer said: 'I'm numb, it's wonderful. It won't sink in for a while, but it's great.

'We've done it before in smaller races and we'll still keep doing it, but it's fantastic to do it on the big stage.

'I can't remember where I watched it as I'm not very good at watching races.

'The decision was very tricky because the weather forecast was so up and down and obviously we were liaising very closely with Simon Claisse (clerk of the course) and walking the course. But we made the right decision.

'He's a gorgeous horse and it's so tragic that Sara's dad (Lord Oaksey) wasn't here today to see it.'

Rich Ricci, owner of the Willie Mullins-trained Djakadam, said: 'He's run a stormer, I thought we had him but fair play to the winner, to run in this race as a novice and to do that from the front was spectacular.

'He'll be back next year. We've had a great week.'

His rider Ruby Walsh said: 'He's run a blinder. He made a few little jumping errors, but he's run a blinder for a six-year-old.

'He stuck his head out and gave me everything he had.'

Mullins said: 'We had a fantastic run and I was just commending the winner's brave decision to run in the Gold Cup. It paid off and the winner did it the hard way in front.

'I was delighted with my horse. He ran well. He jumped great and got a good position. I don't have any excuses and Ruby doesn't either.

'Our fellow is only a six-year-old and the winner's an eight-year-old. In those conditions, when stamina comes to the fore, age will always beat youth. We'll go on to Punchestown.'

Noel Meade said of Road To Riches: 'He ran a great race. We're delighted and disappointed. What other way can you be?

'We thought we had a chance at the last. It's possible the ground was a disadvantage to us. Maybe it wasn't, but we think it might have been.'

Richie McLernon, rider of fourth home Holywell, said: 'He stays all day and you can't ask any more. He gave me his all today.'

His trainer Jonjo O'Neill said: 'We're delighted with our little horse. It was a brilliant race really.

'We had to put a lot of effort in with his jumping. He'd be better on better ground, but today the best horse won.

'Our horse ran a blinder and we're thrilled to bits with him.

'The winner is a fantastic horse and they couldn't catch him.'

Paul Nicholls, trainer of the vanquished favourite Silviniaco Conti, who was seventh, said: 'Noel (Fehily) is not really sure. My view is that the ground might have been deep enough for him. It was a bit more testing than we thought.

'Watching that I suppose he is better on a flatter track on better ground. If he's fresh and well we'll probably head to Aintree with him now.'

Tony McCoy was ninth on Carlingford Lough in what was his final ride in the Gold Cup before retirement.

The 19-times champion said: 'I knew when we got here this morning we were in trouble. He's a horse that likes good ground and for a horse that's slow but has a bit of speed at the end of his race, he doesn't like it when it turns into a drag.'

Paying tribute to the winner, McCoy said: 'Fair do's to the Bradstocks for running him. It was an unbelievable performance from a novice chaser.

'He got them at it early and stuck at it well. All credit to them. It's fantastic.'
