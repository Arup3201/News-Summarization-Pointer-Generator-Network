While global financial meltdown and double-dip recessions have left many of us counting the pennies, it seems that the streets of London are still paved with gold for some.

The UK capital is home to more multimillionaires than any other city in the world according to new figures.

London boasts a staggering 4,224 'ultra-high net worth' residents - people with a net worth of more than $30million, or £19.2million.

Tokyo is in second place with 3,525 
multimillionaires, with Singapore in third with 3,154 and New York City 
in fourth with 2,929, reveal figures from WealthInsight.

New
 York's relatively low ranking, given that the US is the world's biggest
 economy, is attributed by experts to the fact that cities like London 
have a higher concentration of the super rich whereas they are spread 
out across the US.

Some 40 per cent of UK multimillionaires live in London compared to seven per cent of their US counterparts in New York.

Examples of the super-rich living in London include property developer Nick Candy, whose joint fortune with his brother is estimated to be more than £1bn, and Britain's richest man  Alisher Usmanov, estimated to be worth more than £18bn.

Super-rich: Areas such as Knightsbridge, picture, Mayfair and Kensington, where property prices are particularly expensive, are home to many of London's super-rich

Wealthy: London is now home to a staggering 4,224 multi-millionaires

Work and leisure space: London's mix of expensive homes and status as a business hub as well as its picturesque use of open spaces makes it attractive to the super rich

In total, London is home to 281,000 millionaires, more than Frankfurt or Paris, with 675,000 in the entire country.

The US boasts the most millionaires in the world with more thn 5.2 million in total.

But
 it seems that China is catching the UK up, with experts predicting that
 Chinese cities will have doubled their number of multimillionaires by 
2020.

That leap would make it the second biggest nation of millionaires ahead of Japan and Germany but behind the United States.

Second place: Tokyo comes in second place behind London in its number of multi-millionaires with 3,525

Stunning: Singapore boasts the third highest number of residents worth more than $30million with 3,154

The UK is set to fall from sixth to eighth in that ranking according to the research, with India also expected to leapfrog.

And while London might boast the most millionaires, it is lagging behind both New York and Moscow when it comes to billionaires.

New York boasts 70 billionaires, Moscow is home to 64 and London has 54 resident billionaires.

Lagging: Despite being part of the world's largest economy, New York is only fourth in the list with 2,929 but it does boast the most billionaires

Moscow boasts the second highest number of billionaires in the world, with 64 living there compared to London's 54
