Cleared: Michael Le Vell enjoyed a pint to mark being cleared of 12 child sex charges

Michael Le Vell's unstable life off-screen could have been a storyline written for any soap.

His trial laid bare a 'troubled man' who chain-smoked, drank up to 12 pints a night, had a string of one-night stands and even an affair with a younger woman while his wife had cancer treatment.

But the 48-year-old Coronation Street actor, who made his name playing mechanic Kevin Webster for 30 years, told the jury at Manchester Crown Court that his ‘little dark secrets’ did not mean he was a paedophile.

As Le Vell walked free from court after being found not guilty of raping and sexually assaulting a girl from the age of six, ITV bosses said they were preparing to discuss his return to the soap.

Commenting after the verdicts, a spokesman for Coronation Street said: 'We are looking forward to meeting with Michael to discuss his return to the programme.'

During the trial, Le Vell's barrister admitted his client was a 'drunk and a bad husband' whose 
behaviour was sometimes 'terrible', but he is not a child rapist.

Like his character, whose love for the Rover's Return was well-known, Le Vell admitted he 'went out every night because I’m working class' and told of two failed attempts to grapple with his heavy drinking at Alcoholics Anonymous.

The actor often drank seven or eight pints a night but on occasions he would down 12 pints.

But despite his alcoholism, he still managed to work for 30 years as one of Britain's best known soap stars.

He told the court he would go to the pub most nights of the week, especially if he had been filming Coronation Street.

He said: ‘I’m a bloke, after work I’m going to go and wind down for an hour or two. I know it sounds chauvinistic - that’s the way I was brought up unfortunately.’

Born in Newton Heath, Manchester, he was one of six siblings in a working class family. Three of his sisters - one has died - and his brother sat in the public gallery during the trial to give their support.

Return: ITV bosses have said they are preparing to discuss his return to the soap

Evidence: Le Vell's trial revealed 'dark secrets' of hard-drinking and a string of affairs behind his wife's back, even when she was having chemotherapy

His mother died from a brain tumour when he was 15 and his father from lung cancer when he was 22.

Le
Vell said he became involved in acting aged 12 after playing a part in a
school production of Kes - earlier made famous by Ken Loach's film 
portrayal.

It led to a 
stint at Oldham Theatre Workshop, which has also produced star actresses
Anna Friel and Suranne Jones, and performances at the town's Coliseum 
Theatre.

In the early days of his career he also worked in a men's boutique and as a plasterer's labourer.

His
big break came when he won the part of Kevin Webster after auditioning 
following another role on the soap, as Neil Grimshaw, a newspaper 
delivery boy who worked at The Kabin.

He
first appeared as Webster in the soap on October 19 1983, moving in 
with Hilda Ogden as her lodger and getting a job as an apprentice 
mechanic with Brian Tilsley.

Le
Vell has featured in some of Coronation Street's most explosive 
storylines, most recently Webster's affair with Molly Dobbs, which 
apparently made him consider quitting the soap.

for decades

Controversial: Webster's affair with Molly Dobbs in 2009 finally cost him his on-screen marriage, and at the time it was reported that he was considering quitting the soap despite having the 'best job in the world'

During the 1980s he became something of a gay icon and would receive a high volume of fan mail from gay men.

This was reportedly due to the fact he wore tight jeans and a moustache and appeared on screen with his left ear pierced.

He later claimed that the attention from gay men ended as soon after he shaved off his facial hair. 

He
has been much-loved by fans who have followed the trials and 
tribulations of Kevin, particularly through to his stormy marriage to 
Sally, played by Sally Dynevor, and fathering two teenage girls as well 
as a child from an affair.

The
Websters finally called time on their marriage after Molly Dobbs, played by 
Vicky Binns, confessed to Sally that Kevin was her baby’s father as she 
lay dying in hospital following the street’s famous tram crash.

In
real life he married Coronation Street co-star Janette Beverley in 
October 1986. They couple have two children together but split in 2010.

This year Le Vell reportedly dated Emma Dodd, 28, after his split from his wife.

He then went on to date Chilean mother-of-four Blanca Fouche.

Stalwart: Michael Le Vell, real name Michael Turner, has been in the ITV soap since 1983 and is one of the country's biggest soap stars, and like his character, it has emerged how much he enjoys a drink

Although
the actor has not filmed any scenes for the ITV soap since he was 
charged earlier this year, he has not been officially suspended as bosses were reportedly 
waiting on the outcome of the trial.

Le Vell pledged to carry on playing Kevin Webster because he still viewed it as 'the best job on television'.

It was reported that he would be offered a new £250,000 contract to stay with the ITV soap if he was cleared.

His life on Coronation Street, at 
times, had remarkable similarities, where he had a series of affairs 
behind the back of hard-pressed wife Sally and also went on a series of 
drinking binges.

Eleanor
Laws QC, prosecuting, suggested that in real life Le Vell drank so 
often and regularly because he was ashamed of the sexual abuse he had 
allegedly committed.

She asked the actor: ‘Are you a troubled man? Because something was troubling you... to go out every night?’

Le
Vell admitted he was a heavy drinker but replied: ‘No, I went out every
night because I’m working class. It’s what my parents did before me.’

Miss
Laws said: ‘I suggest that at times when you were sober you were 
finding it difficult to live with yourself. This abuse started, you just
could not stop yourself.'

Le
Vell told the jury that during his 25-year marriage to his wife he had 
had a series of one-night stands when he worked away from home.

He said he had been having an affair with Olivia Wallis, 32, at the same time as his wife was receiving chemotherapy for cancer.

He said his 25-year marriage had been ‘crumbling’ and he had sought comfort in the arms of a close friend and ‘confidante.’

The jury was also told of a conversation which he had with someone last year about ‘secrets’ and he also agreed telling the same person that what he had done was ‘something unforgiveable’.

In
trying to prove his innocence the star was forced to reveal all about 
his personal problems and said the allegations against him left him 
'fighting for his life'.

He 
said the girl, who claimed she was raped at the age of six, nine and 
ten, was 'seriously deluded, I’m sorry. What can I say, she’s telling a 
pack of lies. It’s all nonsense.’

After being found not guilty today he is now free to return to his long and successful acting career.
