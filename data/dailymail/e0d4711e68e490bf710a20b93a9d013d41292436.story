Nadine Dorries was among 28 MPs who gave relatives pay rises at the taxpayers' expense, as it was revealed she employed both her daughters in her parliamentary office at a total cost of up to £80,000.

The Tory MP is one of 155 MPs - including five ministers - who employed family members last year at a total cost of up to £327,000 - all of it funded from the public purse.

Ms Dorries, the MP for Mid Bedfordshire, boosted the salary of her daughter Philippa, 28, into the £40,000-£44,999 pay band from the £30,400 she was earning as a constituency caseworker.

The MP - and one-time I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! contestant - paid her daughter Jennifer, 26, up to £35,000 to work as a 'senior secretary'.

MPs claimed a record £98million in allowances last year, according to figures from the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority - up from £95.4million in 2009.

Cabinet minister Michael Moore, health minister Dan Poulter and foreign minister Alistair Burt were among other MPs revealed to have employed relatives in their parliamentary or constituency offices.

Ms Dorries - who repaid £3,000 in travel expenses last year after accepting that the claims were 'wrongfully made and should not have been allowed' - wrote on Twitter: 'I do employ my daughter. Always have 
always will. She never asks 'can this wait until Monday’ when I call 
about work on a Sunday night at 9pm!'

She has also said that employing her daughter Jennifer as a caseworker provided 'value for money' as she worked weekends and could be relied on, and wrote on Twitter: 'Given the hours she works, she would argue, very strongly that she is on less than minimum wage and very abused' - adding a smiley face.

Philippa Dorries left her mother's office last year and Jennifer joined soon afterwards, meaning they did not work for the 56-year-old MP at the same time.

Ms Dorries, who was suspended from the party last year following a row over her appearance on the ITV reality TV show, has previously called for MPs' expenses to be abolished entirely.

She announced yesterday that she has signed a six-figure deal to write three books about her upbringing on a Liverpool housing estate.

She said it was 'ridiculous' to
 suggest the figures from the 2012-13 financial year meant her 
­daughter’s salary had shot up by £20,000, adding: 'Philippa went from part-time to full time and left 13 months ago.'

Philippa was employed by her mother in 2012 while she was studying for a degree at BPP Law School in London.

In June it was also revealed that she was dating Conservative MP Chris Kelly - the 34-year-old son of multi-millionaire owner of the lorry firm Keltruck.

Ipsa figures showed that Lib Dem Scotland Secretary Michael Moore, 
who earns £134,565 a year, paid his wife Alison between £15,000 and £19,000 
in the 12 months to April - up from £14,999 the previous year.

Dan Poulter put his mother Carol's salary up to £39,999 from the £30,000-£34,999 pay band, employing her as his secretary.

Conservative MPs Christopher Chope and Peter Bone paid their wives 
the highest amount – between £45,000 and £49,999 a year.

A further eight MPs, including Ms Dorries, paid family members between £40,000 and £44,999 over the course of last financial year.

Stephen
 Hammond, the transport minister, paid his wife up to £45,000, while 
Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, and Patrick McLoughlin, the 
Transport Secretary, paid their wives between £35,000 and £39,999.

Laurence
 Robertson, the Conservative MP for Tewkesbury, employed both his estranged wife, Susan Robertson, and his current partner, Anne Marie 
Adams at between £25,000
 and £29,999 and between £40,000 and £44,999.

Along with Ms Dorries, MPs including Tory David Burrowes, Lib Dem Malcolm Bruce, Labour’s Angela Smith and Julie Elliott bumped their relatives' salaries up by two pay bands.

Four Labour MPs Michael Dugher, Phil Wilson and Ian Lavery and hiked a relative up three salary bands.

Party vice-chairman Michael Dugher put his wife Joanna’s wages up from £19,999 to as much as £34,999, Labour whip Phil Wilson increased his wife Margaret's salary from £24,999 to £39,999 and Wansbeck MP Ian Lavery put his wife Hilary on £24,999 from £9,999.

There were just three MPs, Tories Gavin Williamson, Henry ­Bellingham and Labour’s Paul Farrelly, who gave a partner or relative a pay cut.
