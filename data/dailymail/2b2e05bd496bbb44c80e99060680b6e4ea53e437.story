The cat with a massive online following - Grumpy Cat - made a star turn in New York City on Sunday.

The famous feline was at the Jacob K. Javits Center in Manhattan for Toy Fair 2015. 

Grumpy Cat, whose real name is Tardar Sauce, was at a Gund booth for a two-hour meet and greet at the trade event. Gund sells a range of plush toys made in the cat's likeness, as well as Grumpy Cat-themed lanyards and slippers.

The cat is known her surly-seeming facial expression being shared online and used in Internet memes. Now a bona fide celebrity, Grumpy Cat has multiple brand deals, and even appeared in a Lifetime network Christmas movie.

Prior to Sunday's event, Grumpy Cat's Instagram shared an flyer advertising that the meet and greet would be held from 10am to 12pm.

Later, it featured a photo of Grumpy Cat at the Sunday morning happening. In typical fashion, she - or the humans managing her social media accounts - seemed non-plussed.

The photo's caption read 'I went to Toy Fair once. It was awful. #ToyFair #ToyFair15 #ToyFairNY #ToyFairNYC #GUND #GottaGettaGUND.'

The sourpuss also had her trademark expression on display in photographs with elves and Santa Claus that appeared on Gund's Twitter account.

Gund captioned a photograph of Grumpy Cat with old St. Nick 'Somebody has been bad this year @RealGrumpyCat #tfny #ToyFair15.'

Another photo from the company's Twitter account showed that Grumpy Cat was in a red bed surrounded by her stuffed doppelgangers.

Its caption read 'Make sure to practice your grumpiest face! #tfny #ToyFair15.'

Gund also shared snaps of fans waiting in line to see Grumpy Cat and take photos with her.

Several fans shared selfies on Twitter with Grumpy Cat.

Among them was user @kristinajunkk, who tweeted 'GUYS I JUST MET GRUMPY CAT IM SO STARSTRUCK RN' along with a selfie.

Another, @Nagler, shared a selfie and wrote 'I went to the Toy Fair once. It was awful. #grumpycat.'

On Grumpy Cat's website, her owners explain 'Her petite size and famous face is likely due to feline dwarfism and her rear end wobbles a bit when she walks due to this; otherwise she is a perfect little kitty!'

'We take great care of Tardar Sauce; 99% of the time she is a normal kitty. She plays, hides, and acts as cats act,' the website also says. '(She LOVES to hide behind the curtains!) She isn't in front of a camera all of the time like many people perceive. 

'We only take photos sets once every week or so and on the few occasions where we have met with the media or licensed partners we ensure the sessions are short and that she isn't handled by many people. Tardar Sauce is a member of the family before anything else!'

The feeling's not mutual! Two fans appear with the sourpuss on Sunday at the Jacob K. Javits Center
