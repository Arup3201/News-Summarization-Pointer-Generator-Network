Friends of a young Sydney woman who could face the death penalty in China for allegedly trying to smuggle the drug 'ice' first became worried when she failed to show as a bridesmaid at her best mate's wedding in mid-November.

Kalynda Davis, 22, a talented basketballer from Glenmore Park in Sydney's west, will face a Chinese court this week accused of trying to import 75kg of methamphetamine to Australia.

She was arrested with Peter Gardner, 25, from Richmond in Sydney's north-west.

It is believed they had known each other for just weeks before they flew to Guangzhou on November 5.

Friends of Davis told Daily Mail Australia they became concerned when Davis did not appear at the wedding ceremony 10 days later on the afternoon of November 15.

Her friends said the drug crime allegations that emerged this week were unbelievable and 'out of character'.

In a Facebook conversation seen by Daily Mail Australia, one clearly angered friend of the 22-year-old was enraged at Gardner, her alleged accomplice. 

'He took her from us! He deserves nothing! He took our Kalynda and used her,' the friend wrote.

'She would be so scared right now. I just want to hug her.’ 

A source close to the family confessed it was a stressful time for the Davis family.

Worried family members reported her missing on the day she left for China but many of her friends were unaware of her disappearance. 

Lawyer Paul Blunt told Daily Mail Australia: 'The family just wishes all media outlets respect their privacy at this difficult time.'  

Another friend of Davis', Blake Tatafu, 22, said he was shocked by the allegations, which were extremely unexpected.

Davis' friends hoped for the best and shared the blame in various social media posts. They became concerned when she did not show up as a bridesmaid for her best friend

'All the allegations, really - it's very out of character for her,' Mr Tatafu, who has known Davis for about a decade, told Daily Mail Australia.

'I don't understand if the allegations were true how they would come about.'

Mr Tatafu, who had not talked to Davis for about a month, was stunned when he saw missing posters circulating on social media a fortnight ago, describing his reaction as: ‘Oh s***.'

He said if Davis had been seeing Gardner, it would be unusual for her friends not to know.

Neighbours of the Davis family mirrored Mr Tatafu's shock at the news. 

The Davis family live in a large double storey brick home with a pool at the back of a golf course in Glenmore Park, a wealthy pocket of Sydney's greater west, which is home to many young families.

One neighbour who preferred not to be named told Daily Mail Australia he had only kind words to say about the family.

The family's patriarch, dad Larry, is an ANZ mobile insurance broker who operates in the city's far west.

'They're a genuinely good family,' the neighbour said.

'They really are. When my son told me she was on the news, I hadn't even heard of it.' 

'Kalynda was an amazing girl she just got herself into the wrong crowd,' one friend said

Davis, who studied at Penrith Anglican School, was very active on Instagram and had many friends in Sydney's outer west.

Mr Tatafu said she was a keen community advocate who had participated in fun runs and fundraising efforts for mental health and cancer campaigns. 

'If I could tell her anything is to "Stay strong, it's going to be very tough times ahead. Remember you still have family and friends who love you back home",' he said. 

As for Gardner, his friends said he had been doing well for himself until the drug charges. 

The muscular 25-year-old with blond hair was also reported missing the day he flew to Guangzhou.

One mate wrote on Facebook: 'He was doing so so well for himself as well, and now this!'

Another friend, Brad King, told Daily Mail Australia in a statement: 'He was actually a really genuine bloke who would do anything for his mates.' 

On November 8, three days after the pair arrived in Guangzhou, Davis and Gardner were apprehended by Chinese authorities at the airport, 9News reported.

The pair  booked their seats on the plane at the Flight Centre at a nearby shopping centre, the broadcaster said.

A New South Wales police spokeswoman said they had referred to the matter to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade as soon as Davis was located overseas. 

A number of Australians have been detained overseas on drug charges in recent times.

The most infamous of these cases is that of convicted drug smuggler Schapelle Corby, who served nine years in an Indonesian prison.

Some have been put to death, including Vietnamese Australian Van Tuong Nguyen, who was hung for drug trafficking on December 2, 2005.

According to U.S. human rights groups, China is the world's biggest executioner, having put 2,400 people to death in 2013 alone.  

Ice is an increasingly popular drug in Australia, with the number of drug users who take the substance increasing significantly in 2014 - from 55 per cent in 2013 to 61 per cent in the six months leading to October this year, according to the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre.

The man who gave Gardner his apprenticeship, builder Michael Kulakovski, said he was deeply concerned for the young man's future.

'To be caught with substance in China is probably one of the worst countries to be caught in,' Mr Kulakovski told 9News.

'He was doing really good, he had a lot of work and he was earning good money. [I] don't know why he's done this.' 

One of Davis' friends expressed a similar sentiment. 

'Please don't let anyone portray her as something she's not,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'She's the most fun, loving, beautiful girl and so full of life. She just made the biggest mistake of her life.' 

Davis and Gardner's case were expected to be heard by a Chinese court later this week.
