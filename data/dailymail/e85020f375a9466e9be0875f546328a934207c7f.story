A divorcee has launched a one-woman crusade to stop her Turkish toyboy being deported - despite him staying in Britain illegally.

Julie Haycocks, 53, was devastated 
when her 19-year-old partner Cihat Haciveliogullari, known locally as Alex, was taken from his workplace by officials six weeks ago.

The kebab shop worker, from 
Shropshire, is currently being held at the Dungavel Immigration Removal 
Centre in Scotland after his permission to stay in the country expired.

Self-employed dog walker Julie Haycocks has started a petition called 'Right To Remain For Alex' on Facebook and is in constant contact with him while he awaits his fate

Facing deportation: Alex, who worked at his uncle's kebab shop, said: 'My family were always very judgmental about mine and Julie's relationship, but I knew that our love was very real'

Julie, who lives in a semi-detached 
cottage with her teenage lover, is now campaigning to keep him in the country.

'My family were always very judgmental about mine and Julie's relationship, but I knew that our love was very real.

'We argued about it a lot but the bottom line is that we were meant to be together and I don't want anyone my own age'

She said: 'When I got divorced I thought I would never meet anyone nice again. But then Alex came and I have never been happier.'

Julie claims it was love at first sight when the couple met at the Tesco where she was working on the checkouts three years ago.

She said: 'He was only 17 but we had a lot in common and we hit it off immediately.

'We spent all our time together and it was only three months before he moved in. He proposed after six months but silly me told him that we had plenty of time.

'If I only knew what was going to happen I would have said yes. We were due to get married this Christmas but that is all going to have to wait now.'

The self-employed dog walker already 
has three grown-up children Richard, 30, William, 28, and Eddie, 26, but
admitted trying for a baby with Alex.

Julie, 53, admits trying for a baby with the teenager. 'Unfortunately when we started trying I 
went to the doctor and the nurse laughed and said "you might look young 
Julie but I'm afraid it's too late for all that".'

She said: 'Alex loves children and we both love babies. Unfortunately when we started trying I went to the doctor and the nurse laughed and said "you might look young Julie but I'm afraid it's too late for all that".

'Luckily caring Alex said he didn't mind and that he didn't get with me to have children, he loved me for me.

'We are the odd couple of the village because there is a big age gap, but I like younger people and he prefers older so we are perfect for each other.'

Julie has started a petition called 'Right To Remain For Alex' on Facebook and is in constant contact with him while he awaits his fate.

His case has now been referred to the immigration team in the West Midlands who will decide his fate in the next four weeks.

Alex, who works for his uncle in Five Star Kebab House, in Whitchurch, said: 'My family were always very judgmental about mine and Julie's relationship, but I knew that our love was very real.

'We argued about it a lot but the bottom line is that we were meant to be together and I don't want anyone my own age.'
