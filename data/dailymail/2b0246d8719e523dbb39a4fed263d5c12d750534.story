Prefers everyday life: While she loved winning Olympic silver, Zara Phillips prefers the simple pleasures including a trip to Waitrose to the glamour of life in the Royal Family

She may be the Queen’s grand-daughter and one of our Olympic medallists to boot, but Zara Phillips craves a low-key domesticity which couldn’t be further from life in the Royal Family.

Instead of pomp and glamour, it is the simple pleasures of buying new shoes, a trip to Waitrose or a rainy afternoon spent watching a DVD that she dreams of, she revealed today.

But for the time being at least, what to many of us is a day-to-day reality remains a distant dream for the 31-year-old.

Fresh from winning silver as part of 
our eventing team, she remains so busy with her equestrian career that 
even a year after her wedding to rugby player Mike Tindall, they still 
have not had time to book a honeymoon.

She
told how she was ‘still living the Olympic dream’ and revelling in 
being part of the record-breaking GB squad, but also looking forward to a
return to normality.

Competing
often means getting back to the yard in the middle of the night, faced 
with an hour’s work unloading the horses and their kit with another 
early start to look forward to in the morning.

‘People
assume I always look like I do in my riding kit or in a dress at a 
social event, but the day-to-day me is driving around in my filthy car 
with my dogs in the boot, wearing a pair of jeans and a hoody,’ she 
said.

‘On the rare occasion that we do get a
weekend off, we enjoy spending it together at our home in Cheltenham, 
with the dogs of course.

‘I’ll
make a quick detour past Waitrose on the way back from the yard and 
Mike and I will cook something easy for supper - probably Italian.’ 

Once
the eventing season comes to an end in October, a typical Saturday 
night would be an evening in the local pub with friends - something of a
contrast to her cousin Prince Harry’s style of letting his hair down.

Then a Sunday will see her go swimming followed by a chance to catch up on ‘all the chores I haven’t done’.

‘I enjoy having Sunday lunch with the family and, when it’s cold and wet outside, watching a film afterwards,’ she added.

Busy in equestrian career: Phillips said she was still 'living the Olympic dream' after she was presented her medal by her mother Princess Anne, but was looking forward to returning to normality

In the interview, Phillips described her favourite item of clothing as ‘my jeans’ and her greatest weakness as ‘shoes’.

Her favourite things are her husband, her dogs, her family and friends, her car and her Galaxy tablet computer, she said, while asked what she would have been in another life she replied ‘a sport physio’.

On Sunday, Phillips and the rest of the GB eventing quintet will be reunited as they show off their medals at the Land Rover Burghley Horse Trials.

Favourites: Her husband, rugby player Mike Tindall, her dogs and her family and friends are some of her favourite things

No time for honeymoon: Even after a year of marriage Phillips and Tindall have still not had time to book a honeymoon

While thrilled with their silver, she
admitted to still being disappointed not to have managed the clear 
round in the showjumping that might have seen them win gold.

‘I couldn’t believe how much support we got from the home crowd,’ she said.

‘It
was unreal and wonderful - and the crowds were even louder on 
cross-country day’ - which happened to be her first wedding anniversary.

More horse riding: On Sunday Phillips will join the GB team again at the Land Rover Burghley Horse Trials

Favourite clothing: While most people assume she likes getting dressed up, right, or wearing her riding kit, left, for day-to-day life she picks jeans, her 'favourite item of clothing', and a hooded jumper

The following day, Phillips and her 
horse, High Kingdom, picked up seven penalties in the show jumping, the 
final phase, and the team lost out on gold to Germany.

‘Yes, I was disappointed in myself for what happened,’ she said.

‘I
would have loved to have gone clear but that is the nature of sport - 
if it was easy then the achievements wouldn’t mean so much.

‘I
was delighted with our silver medal. You can always look back at what 
might have been, but the team still came away with a good result at our 
home Games.’

Disappointed with showjumping: While thrilled with silver, Phillips admitted being disappointed not to have managed the clear round in showjumping that might have seen the team win gold

Phillips and the rest of the eventing team stayed at the Olympic Village, and were as caught up in the spirit of the Games as the rest of the country.

‘I felt so honoured to be part of the whole thing, to be there with all those athletes, looking back on so many incredible triumphs,’ she said.

With the eventing season still in full flow, Phillips has had little time to look back on her success.

And she revealed she and Tindall still have no idea when they will fit in a honeymoon more than a year after their wedding, not least with the new rugby season about to start.

‘We’d love to go somewhere hot or skiing but who knows when we’ll get the chance?’ she said.
