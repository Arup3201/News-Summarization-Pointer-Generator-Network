Wheelchair-bound Alex McKinnon returned to Hunter Stadium - home to the Newcastle Knights - for the first time since suffering his spinal injury after a tackle during a match in March.

The 22-year-old  wiped away tears as he was wheeled onto the field for the Knights and Gold Coast Titans clash on Sunday.

The game is dedicated to the former Newcastle Knights player which aims to raise funds for the tragically injured player's ongoing medical expenses.

McKinnon also uploaded a photo, smiling alongside fiancee Teigan Power, and tweeted: 'Off to the footy @NRLKnights feels so good to be home.'

He proposed to Ms Power just a week after being told he may never walk again.

When McKinnon was interviewed on the NRL Footy Show on Thursday night, he renewed his vow to walk his fiancee down the aisle.

'I love her so much and I always will,' he said.

Four months after the accident, McKinnon described how he felt when he was left lying on the pitch.

'I just wanted to get off the field...and people to stop looking at me,' he said.

McKinnon said he tried to maintain upbeat - focusing on his rehabilitation - but he did have his 'low points'.

'They're pretty bad...[but] it would only be 20 minutes or 30 minutes,' he said.

'Hopefully I can impact on the game another way.'

'It's going to be a slow and long process but I am willing to do that.

'I'm 22 and I'm going to give it my best shot.'

McKinnon said he doesn't remember the round three incident at Melbourne's AAMI Park, only the aftermath of 'the whole ground looking at me'.

'Obviously being thrown into a situation like this you don't know how to handle it but the people around me and their help has really motivated me to get back to the person that I am,' he said.

'There is no point of me being angry. You would think I would be filthy on the world and filthy on the game but I'm not. You may as well be content with the situation.
