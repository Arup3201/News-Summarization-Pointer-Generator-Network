The United States accounts for just 5 percent of the world's population, but incarcerates almost a quarter of the prisoners around the globe.

With 2.2 million people in state and federal institutions, the sheer overcrowding in prisons has become so severe that the White House is prepared to listen to any solution, no matter how unusual, to lower the number of inmates.

Warden Rick Ven Wickler, of New Hampshire's Cheshire County Correctional Facility believes he has the answer, allowing his prisoners unrivaled freedoms, pets and crucially, no perimeter fences.

No fences: New Hampshire's Cheshire County Correctional Facility resembles a school more than a high security prison

Van Wickler is of the opinion that while punishment is his primary role, the number of repeat offenders in American jails is simply too high.

He advocates an incarceration that encourages rehabilitation, which will reduce the number of inmates nationally and ultimately, lower costs.

The 54-year-old is in charge of 230 prisoners and runs what has been described as the most liberal prison in the country.

It took Van Wickler 13-years to secure the funding to build this new facility which houses male and female prisoners and during that time he toured prisons nationwide, trying to understand how to operate a more enlightened jail.

Asked by Vice Magazine what some of those innovations were, Van Wickler replied that his best changes are cosmetic.

'Well, the first thing, as I’m sure you’ve noticed, is that there’s no perimeter fence.,' said Van Wickler.

'That’s the idea. Nobody wants a jail in their neighborhood, and we didn’t want to make it obvious. Most people don’t even know it’s a jail. They think it’s a school.'

'That’s the problem with corrections today. They say, ‘We need more fences. We need more cameras. We need more sensors.’ Well, if you just f***ing stay awake and do your job, you don’t need any of that.

'They’ll say, ‘We need a fence to catch escapees.’ Well, how about you don’t let them escape in the first place?

'But here’s the primary reason that I don’t want a perimeter fence: Children come here to visit mom or dad. It’s scary enough for adults to go through concertina wire. Imagine a four-year-old.'

Some inmates are allowed to keeps pets, such as one woman who had a cat named Polo.

'He’s from the Humane Society,' the warden said. 'We have this agreement that the women will take care of the pets until they’re adopted. It’s been very good for the pets, and it’s been very good for the women.'

Claiming to have never had an escape, Van Wickler explained that art and craft projects at the 94,000 square-foot institution are another essential tool in rehabilitation as inmates discover hidden talents.

Security at the modern facility is provided by a huge array of surveillance camera's operated out of a room dubbed 'the secret squirrel room'

High tech: In the absence of fences, the security is provided by a huge network of surveillance cameras manned 24 hours a day by correctional officers

Security: Every aspect of the prisoner's lives is monitored to prevent any indiscretions and for the safety of the inmates

Eschewing the traditional prison mantra of control, Van Wickler believes his inmates are better served by being managed.

Pointing out that this is not splitting hairs, Van Wickler told Vice that he outnumbered.

'It’s 64-to-one in most cases. The only way that you can successfully run a jail is with the offenders’ cooperation,' said Van Wickler.

'If they want to overrun you, they will overrun you. It would seem that the best thing to do is to gain voluntary compliance. The question is how do you do that?'

Another modern innovation at the prison is to have a much more open planned design, with corrections officers, mingling more with the inmates.

Bare: Solitary confinement is still regarded as a severe punishment in Cheshire County Correctional Facility, but is not as harsh as at other prisons

Clean and bright: The prison is also designed to be a positive working environment for the staff as well as the inmates

'Under that old style of architectural design, the inmates would behave as though the area where they lived was their real estate,' said Van Wickler to reporter Roc Morin.

'So, when you went in to bring them meals, or to do a head count, you were encroaching on their territory, and they gave you that sense: ‘You’re in my house.’

'Well, the way we do things here, we’re in their area every day. That takes away their sense of ownership over real estate.'

Respect is a two-way street for the prisoners and corrections officers.

Inmates are referred to by their names and not as inmate and prisoners call the prison staff by their names too and not as officer.

The future? Experts all agree that the United States prison population is too high to continue at current levels

'Also, when they do a room search, they fold our blankets back up,' said inamte Maria.

'They don’t toss everything.'

Indeed, Van Wickler wants working conditions for the corrections officers to be to a high standard, also.

'I always say, ‘Remember that this is a place of employment as well. There are 80 employees here, and aren’t they entitled to a decent workspace? Aren’t they entitled to a little bit of color?’

Pointing out their solitary confinement cells, Van Wickler said that even under that extreme a punishment, inmates are allowed out to shower or to make a phone call for one hour a day.

They are also only allowed to be placed in solitary confinement for no more than 15 days.

'They can have two books, but no photographs, no radio, no TV, nothing. Fifteen days can be a very long time,' said Van Wickler.

Controversially, Van Wickler says that the most important change to the prison system would be to not imprison, nonviolent drug offenders.

'I’ve seen people come into this institution for drug violations,' the warden explained.

'I’ve seen the cost, not only to the taxpayer, but the social costs—the costs of parents being away from their children.

'Contrary to what a lot of media has portrayed and what law enforcement believes, not every person in jail for drug possession is a bad parent.'

'Half a million people die every year in the U.S. from tobacco, and yet nobody’s talking about banning cigarettes.

'The most they’ll do is slap a warning label on the box. A hundred thousand people die per year from alcohol.

'Three hundred thousand die from obesity. A hundred thousand die from prescription medicines. Then you look at the number of all illicit-drug deaths combined and you get 16,000.

'And many of those deaths occur from people using impure drugs, since there’s no quality control on the street.'
