Manchester United's 5-3 capitulation at Leicester in September was, Louis van Gaal confessed on Saturday, his darkest day in charge at Old Trafford.

‘It’s still a mystery,’ wrote the United boss in his programme notes ahead of the rematch with the Premier League’s bottom club.

If he was looking for answers, Van Gaal got them all before half time here.

Three goals were more than enough on this occasion, United’s 3-1 lead never looking like the prelude to another dramatic collapse, in spite of the way they sleepwalked through the second half at times. Indeed, Van Gaal’s only criticism on Saturday was that they ‘killed the game too much’.

‘We lost the away match and we have taken revenge,’ he said. ‘We have dominated, especially in the first half.

‘In the second half, I want to kill the game but I have to admit my players did too much to kill the game. We have played more balls backwards and wide than forwards. you have to play forward without risk.

‘But I am very pleased. I have seen here a team that is playing more like a team.’

Van Gaal had demanded goals after seeing United score a mere five in their last six games and he could have few complaints at the response.

Just as he did at Leicester in September, Robin van Persie was the man to set the ball rolling after an awfully dour opening in which he was guilty of spooning one of precious few chances 10 yards into the air.

The Dutch striker made no mistake when opportunity knocked again in the 24th minute courtesy of great work by his international teammate Daley Blind.

United’s summer signing from Ajax picked Andrej Kramaric’s pocket in midfield as he anticipated a pass out of defence and instantly floated a pass over the top of the Leicester defence.

Van Persie looked suspiciously offside as he raced to meet it but the first-time finish was outstanding, driving the ball beyond Mark Schwarzer with his weaker right foot.

‘The first goal was offside but they are honest mistakes,’ said Leicester boss Nigel Pearson, perhaps too graciously. ‘Sometimes they go for you, sometimes they don’t. It’s unhelpful to have decisions go against you but that’s how it is.

‘But it would be wrong of me spending too much time pointing out one decision in a game against a team who played exceptionally well.’

Having scored the first, Van Persie set up United’s second five minutes later.

Leicester’s lack of pace was ruthlessly exposed again as he spotted Angel di Maria’s overlapping run and played the ball into the Argentine’s path as he accelerated away from Wes Morgan.

Di Maria’s low shot was saved by Mark Schwarzer but Radamel Falcao was ahead of Ritchie de Laet and Marcin Wasilewski to bundle the ball home from close range and claim his fourth goal for United.

Van Gaal said: ‘I am more happy that Falcao was scoring because Robin has already scored enough goals. Falcao needs that goal more than Robin. It is fantastic that they scored and beautiful goals also.’

United made it 3-0 a minute before half-time when Adnan Januzaj —making his first league start since early November — forced a corner from the left.

Blind met Wayne Rooney’s cross with a glancing header and Morgan couldn’t get out of the way fast enough as the ball ricocheted off his head and into the net.

Even the Leicester fans who sang ‘we’re going to win 5-3’ knew lightning would not strike twice.

‘The pure maths of it,’ said Pearson. ‘Three down and people can smell a heavy defeat.’

However, the second half developed into something of a procession for United and it was only when they switched off that Leicester got even a glimpse of goal.

Leonardo Ulloa threatened to race clear of Marcos Rojo just after the hour mark as he broke from halfway and then slipped in the box, with referee Martin Atkinson unimpressed by his claims for a penalty.

Then substitute David Nugent was presented with half a chance by Phil Jones’s lackadaisical backpass to David de Gea, and the goalkeeper had to be alert to block Nugent’s effort from a tight angle.

Leicester did claim a consolation goal in the 80th minute, however, after United failed to clear.

Blind was unfortunate to be hit in the face by the ball at close quarters and was still clearing his head when Esteban Cambiasso flicked the ball into the path of Marc Albrighton.

His cross to the back post found Wasilewski whose downward header was too powerful for De Gea.

A 3-1 lead over Leicester could have evoked bad memories for United, but there were certainly no dramas this time.
