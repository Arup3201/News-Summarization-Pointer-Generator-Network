A Detroit factory worker whose has received over $350,000 in donations from strangers inspired by his story about walking a 21 mile round trip from home to work, has been forced to move house after telling police that he no longer felt safe in his old neighborhood.

James Robertson's plight made national headlines earlier this month and he received a 2015 red Ford Taurus and more than $350,000 from an online campaign inspired by his dedication in walking to his suburban factory job five days a week.

On Tuesday Robertson left the rooming house he has called home for 15 years after contacting police about no longer feeling safe. 

Crime-prevention specialists have offered him temporary living quarters.

'People were actually asking him for money,' 2nd Deputy Chief June West told Detroit Free Press.

Robertson decision was fueled by several recent examples of people in Detroit being victimized after coming into money. 

A man was charged last week in connection with the killing of an 86-year-old man who disappeared in December, three days after winning a $20,000 lottery game.

'He knew about that story, and I also know about an incident in the 1st Precinct where a gentleman was killed after he allegedly won some money,' said Capt. Aric Tosqui. 

Robertson told the DFP that he was relieved to be out of the rooming house and away from his landlady and so-called girlfriend Tanya Fox, 60.

'The issue was, she liked to control everyone and everything,' said Robertson. Although Fox told DFP that the pair remain an item - although she doesn't have his new address.

Robertson has yet to receive any of the cash, raised in just a week of online donations to a GoFundMe.com page created by Evan Leedy.

Robertson and Leedy, 19, are scheduled to meet within a week with financial advisers to discuss management of the funds. 

Robertson has told the Detroit Free Press that his car broke down a decade ago and, making $10.55 an hour, he has been unable to save for a new one

The newspaper said Robertson takes buses to work, but has to walk more than 20 miles round trip because buses do not cover the whole route

Earlier this month Robertson had inspired the nation with his story of how his car had broken down a decade ago and, making $10.55 an hour, he'd been unable to save for a new one. 

On February 6 Robertson thought he was going to look at cars to purchase with Evan Leedy and Blake Pollock, who both helped coordinate the gift, worth an estimated $37,000.

Instead Robertson was greeted by reporters and a team of supporters who first learned of his marathon commute this week in a story that ran in the Sunday Detroit Free Press.

The story has since been widely shared on social media, and Robertson has been featured on national network news programs. The publicity has prompted a renewed discussion about reforming Metro Detroit's troubled public transportation system.

'I don't like it, I love it,' said Robertson, 56, who appeared baffled as he sat behind the wheel of his 2015 red Ford Taurus. 'If only my parents could see me now.'

Leedy, 19, a student at Wayne State University, launched an online GoFundMe.com fundraiser after he read about Robertson's daily trek between his home in Detroit and the Schain Mold & Engineering factory in the suburb of Rochester Hills.

He spent part of the week negotiating a reasonable insurance rate for Robertson, who has not driven in 10 years. Leedy told Reuters he was initially quoted a $15,000-a-year premium, a quote that illustrates Detroit's notoriously high insurance rates.

'I don't like it, I love it,' said Robertson, 56, who appeared baffled as he sat behind the wheel of his 2015 red Ford Taurus. 'If only my parents could see me now.'

The Free Press was tipped off by Pollock, a banker who had befriended Robertson two years ago when he spotted the factory worker walking by his office on his way to work.

A finance expert has now assembled a group of advisers to manage the ever-growing fund, which is now 17,500 times larger than his annual wage - or equivalent to eight and a half years' work

The newspaper said Robertson takes buses to work, but has to walk more than 20 miles round trip because buses do not cover the whole route.

He starts his commute at 8 a.m. for his 2-10 p.m. shift, and does not get home until 4 a.m.

Robertson claims he powers his marathon-like commutes by drinking two liters of Mountain Dew and countless cans of Coke each day.

'I sleep a lot on the weekend, yes I do,' he said, 'but I can't imagine not working,'

Although the commute getting into work is grueling, things are worse on the way back as Robertson has to walk the streets alone, in the dark and freezing cold.

None of his co-workers lives anywhere near him, so catching a ride almost never happens. 

He has perfect attendance at his job, the Free Press said.

His colleagues have been telling him for years to get a car but it appears that Robertson has fallen into a routine that he almost seems to enjoy it.

'I keep a rhythm in my head,' he says. 'I'm not saying I'm a member of some church. But just before I get home, every night, I say, 'Lord, keep me safe.'

About three-quarters of the way home, he has to catch the very last bus of the night at 1am into downtown Detroit - after that it's another five mile trek back to the home he shares with his girlfriend.

Robertson thought he was going to look at cars to purchase with Blake Pollock and Evan Leedy, who both helped coordinate the gift, worth an estimated $37,000

The walk takes him through some shady neighborhoods including Highland Park and the infamous 8 Mile area.

Robertson says he was mugged once but doesn't like to talk about the incident.

Four hours later he is back home to catch some shut-eye before the long-distance commute begins all over again the following afternoon.

'The last five years been really tough because the buses cut back,' Robertson said.

Once he gets to Troy and Detroit, Robertson can take a bus but the schedule is so infrequent the area is really best designed for those that have access to a car.

He says that it's not just the $1,700 monthly paycheck that lures him back to work each day but the very essence of being around his friendly co-workers whom he calls 'family'.

The boss's wife has also taken a shine to him and prepares him home-cooked meals each evening too. 

However, the punishing, all-weather hikes now look like a thing of the past for Robertson,

The car is perfect for the machine operator, who said in an interview with the Detroit Free Press that American manufacturers are more his style, has said all he wants is a Ford Taurus, which will set him back some $27,000.

He said: 'I'm a Ford fan. I remember the Taurus. They look comfortable, nothing fancy. They're simple on the outside, strong on the inside — like me'.

'I'm 6-foot and I think the Mustang's a little tight,... I mostly stay with Americans cars - Lincoln, Fords, GM, Dodge.'

The fundraising campaign for Robertson was started by Evan Leedy, 19-year-old college junior who read his story and decided to raise money for him - initially with a $5,000 goal.

As USA Today notes, Robertson lives in Rochester Hills, a community that has removed itself from the SMART bus program depriving him of any fixed-route large buses. 

The story has drawn focus on Detroit's lack of a cohesive transportation system and its effect on the the high number of residents struggling with unemployment and poverty.

'This is the kind of guy America needs,' wrote Edward Klkotka, who donated $20 to the fund to get Robertson a car. 'Hardworking and dedicated. He has the type of character that every employer dreams about.'

Leedy and Robertson met at a bar in Rochester, Michigan, ahead of a round of national press interviews.

At the encounter, Robertson said: 'I'm always going to be in your debt — I will never forget this.'

The teen responded by showing him some comments left alongside the donations - many of which said that he deserved the money for his decades of hard work.

Although the fund was originally just meant to get Roberston - whose last ride was a decrepit Honda which gave up in 2005 - a new set of wheels, the fund could now do much more.

The cash is likely to help with medical and dental expenses, as well as longer-term commuting expenses like gas, repairs and insurance.

The interviews and meeting were orchestrated by Blake Pollock, a UBS banker who saw Robertson's commute, sometimes gave him lifts, and first told the press about him.
