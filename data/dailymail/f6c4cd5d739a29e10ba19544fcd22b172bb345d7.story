Former Tottenham midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson believes he would have excelled at White Hart Lane under manager Mauricio Pochettino because of the Argentine's style of play.

Iceland international Sigurdsson sealed a move back to Swansea during the summer as part of the deal which saw Ben Davies and Michel Vorm join Tottenham.

The 25-year-old has settled into life back in Wales with minimum ease, scoring three Premier League goals for Garry Monk's side, however he still thinks he has the ability to ply his trade at White Hart Lane.

Sigurdsson, speaking to The Times, said when asked if could fit into Pochettino's high-pressing team: 'That's what we do here.'

And when pushed, he added: 'Yes. Pochettino is trying to bring the style he had at Southampton and of course it's going to take time.

'I'm pretty sure the chairman is going to give him a couple of seasons to get it right.'

The attacking midfielder also revealed he was reluctant to leave Spurs during the summer as he wanted to prove himself at the north London outfit.

'My first reaction was, Gylfi, don't leave Tottenham, it will look like you can't make it to the next level.'
