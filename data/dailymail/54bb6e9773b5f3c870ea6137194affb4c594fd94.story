A heavily-pregnant woman has given birth to a baby girl in a crown court after going into labour in the witness room.

The 25-year-old attended Birmingham Crown Court to support a friend who was giving evidence in a trial.

However, half-way through proceedings, the woman’s waters broke and court staff were forced to leap into action and help.

The 25-year-old woman attended Birmingham Crown Court (above) to support a friend who was giving evidence in a trial, but ended up giving birth in the witness room after her waters broke midway through proceedings

Paramedics were also called to the scene at 2.40pm yesterday but found they did not have time to get her to hospital and she gave birth to a baby girl just 10 minutes later.

The newborn was taken in the arms of a paramedic to a waiting ambulance which then transferred mother and baby to Birmingham Women's Hospital.

A spokesman for West Midlands Ambulance Service said: ‘Crews were called to Birmingham Crown Court at 2.40pm to reports that a 25-year-old pregnant woman had gone into labour.

‘Two ambulances attended and the baby was born inside the court building.

‘Both the baby and mother were taken by ambulance to Birmingham Women's Hospital.’

Witnesses said court clerks, ushers and security guards all gathered around to give the woman a round of applause as she was wheeled out of the building.

One witness said: ‘I saw two ambulances outside the court building. There were paramedics rushing up the stairs.

‘One of the paramedics later came out with a newborn in his arms wrapped in a blanket with an oxygen mask over its face.’

Paramedics were called to the scene but did not have time to get the woman to hospital and she ended up giving birth to a girl just 10 minutes later. They were both later taken to Birmingham Women's Hospital

Another onlooker added: ‘There was a bit of a commotion in the corridors when word got around, she had her first taste of a court at a pretty young age. Let's hope that's not an omen.

‘Some of the court staff gathered around and gave her a round of applause as she was led out, mother and baby both looked to be doing well.’

Victim Support West Midlands tweeted about the incident saying: ‘2day baby girl born in @VictimSupport witness waiting room, Bham Crown Court - thanks 2 all who assisted & mother & baby doing well!!!.’

It is the second time a mother has given birth in an unusual place in Birmingham in the space of a month.

An expectant mum went into labour outside Primark and gave birth on the pavement on the high street on July 2.
