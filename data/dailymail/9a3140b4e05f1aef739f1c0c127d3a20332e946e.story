Creating an aircraft is no small feat and the Virgin team have captured the process in an impressive three-minute video. 

Described as evolution in air travel, the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner  was created as a celebration of the 30th anniversary of the first ever Virgin Atlantic flight in 1984.

The 'Birthday Girl' is shown being constructed: from the building of its shell, to having seats installed ans paint applied; and the video shows the vast team needed to create a plane of this size.

Described by Todd Nelp, the Vice President of European sales for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, as providing an unrivalled passenger experience, the Virgin Atlantic 787-9 has some interesting quirks to enhance guests' flights.

The Boeing 787-9, which is the first of its kind in Europe, and also has the biggest windows of any commercial aircraft. 

Wifi is available throughout all journeys, so fliers can remain connected on their travels onboard. 

These have been installed with electronic lighting, which can be controlled easily by the touch of a dimmer switch.

The timelapse video begins by showing sections of the plane waiting to be moved and fitted together

The wings of the Boeing 787-9 are moved into place using a crane and held in place by machinery

In total the aircraft has 31 Upper Class, 35 Premium Economy and 198 Economy seats.

Friendlier to the environment, the plane is 21 per cent more fuel efficient compared to similar sized aircrafts, and produces less carbon dioxide emissions.

The timelapse shows the fascinating process involved with creating the finished look of an aircraft.

The video begins by showing the various parts of the aircraft ready to be assembled. The wings are then moved into place by cranes and the attached into place.

The inside of the plane is then kitted out with seats, overhead cabins and the new Vera Touch 2 in-flight entertainment system, which will provide guests with more than 400 hours of films, TV, games and audio entertainment.

Fliers will also have extra headspace, leg room, and reclining area due to higher ceilings and better use of cabin space.

Outside assembled, the team start on filling the interior with seats and the inflight screen

Guests can also enjoy wifi throughout the duration of the flight, keeping them connect with the world

To limit jet lag and promote relaxation, infinity mood lighting is installed, and there will be cleaner air and more oxygen for refreshing travel. 

The new Upper Class bar is the perfect place to unwind with friends or meet other guests. 

Guests in Premium Economy can go for a walk to the Wander Wall and take advantage of the drinks and food.

The preparation to paint the aircraft begins and the Boeing 787-9 is moved into a separate warehouse

We then see the extensive process involved with painting the vast aircraft. 

It took 1000 litres of paint and over nine days to coat the Birthday Girl - that's enough paint to cover 16 football pitches.

Stencils are used for the main lettering for the company's logo and the 'Birthday Girl' label, and the paint is environmentally friendly and has a ten year lifespan.  

Precise work! Staff top up the coat of the Virgin Atlantic aircraft and use a total of 1000 litres of paint

The plane is named 'Birthday Girl' in honour of the 30th anniversary of the first Virgin Atlantic flight in 1984

The aircraft is spray painted by the team, and stencils are used for the iconic black Virgin Atlantic logo

After nine days the finished product is finally revealed and the team inspect how the logos have turned out

Virgin has purchased 15 Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners worth USD8 billion, with a possible further 28 aircrafts in the pipeline. 

The aircraft will immediately replace the carrier's six A340-300s and eventually its B747-400 fleet.

Virgin founder Sir Richard Branson said, 'The Dreamliner will bring a step change to the industry, substantially reducing environmental impact and incorporating innovative design and advanced technology, while providing an enhanced flying experience for our passengers.'
