He was beaten with a belt, choked and hit in the face with a brick.

But after being rescued by patrol officer Brandon Melbar of Cleveland and close to death, one-year-old pit bull Harvard has gone on to become a beloved pet of the man who saved him.

Officer Melbar originally agreed to just foster the dog, but fell in love with the pooch and decided to officially adopt him.

'He just rolls over, wants you to rub his belly, he’s not aggressive at all … He’s just been pretty lovable,' Melbar told Fox Cleveland.
