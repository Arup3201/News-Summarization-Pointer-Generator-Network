An elderly lady's hopeful campaign to bring out the best in a deprived road in Birmingham, dubbed Benefits Street, ends in failure after a lacklustre effort from neighbours and even threats of violence.

Despite the enthusiasm of a local, known only as Sue, who enters notorious James Turner Street, Birmingham, into the Britain in Bloom competition, the community fails to impress the judges in an episode of the Channel 4 documentary to be broadcast this evening.

Ahead of the competition, Sue told the cameras: 'I moved in 20 years ago, and older people said there was a queue to get into these houses.

Campaign: Sue's hopes to bring out the best in those living in the street with a gardening competition failed

Hopes: The pensioner entered the notorious James Turner Street into the Britain in Bloom competition

In the spirit of things: One resident decked the front of her home with hanging baskets for the judges

'Everyone had a tree in their front garden, and everyone was planted up. That is what it could be again.'

And some residents made the effort to recapture the old days ahead of the judges' arrival. One, called 
Hycainth, decking her paved front garden in hanging baskets.

But other elements were less able to draw the judges' praise, including Deidre 'White Dee' Kelly, 42, who declined to install any flowers, or her companion 'Black Dee', who wondered aloud why Sue was bothering.

And, although the judges were not around to see it, immediately after Sue had shown them around the street the camera crews were confronted by two angry men.Â

Attempts: In one scene, the pensioner can be seen walking the street with a selection of greenery

Opposition: 'White Dee' declined to participate in the Britain in Bloom competition

Waving a hammer, one of them made threatening remarks to the people filming the documentary, and had to be placated by other residents.

In a ceremony shown at the end of the programme, it was revealed that James Turner Street had come eighth in the local round of the competition.

The residents, however, seemed pleased with the achievement and celebrated in a ceremony at the village hall.

Sue made clear that she would maintain her aspirations for the road - which she said was once extremely desirable - by entering it again next year, despite the difficulties caused by many of the residents moving to other properties so often.

Certificate: The group came eighth in the competition

However, this too was blighted by accusations that Gerard, White Dee's six-year-old son, had bitten another child. His mother forcefully denied that it could of happen - admitting that while 'he may not be perfect', 'only animals bite'.

The show tonight airs in the midst of huge opposition from politicians, who have attacked the programme as a 'misrepresentation' of those on benefits.

Producers have also been accused by 
those who feature in the show of doing 'anything they could' for 
outrageous footage, including bribing residents with alcohol and fast 
food.

State: One resident stands in front of a large pile of rubbish left on the pavement

Controversial: The show has attracted negative remarks about how those featured are portrayed

Police: Some scenes in the series have led to police involvement

But producer Kieran Smith yesterday said he was 'very proud' of the show, which he called 'a documentary series of the highest order.'

In comments to the Daily Star, he said: 'All right, we followed someone when the went on a shoplifting spree - I don't think we need to apologise for that.'

'It's incredibly sympathetic and an honest take on what happened on that street when we were filming.'

Rubbish: Some parts of the street were shown to be covered in litter during the show this evening
