Thousands of new mothers are being let down by inadequate GP appointments that are supposed to ensure they recover well from labour, a study has found.

Nearly half said their six-week post-natal check was not thorough enough, with one in five saying it lasted less than five minutes.

Almost a third (29 per cent) claimed their GP did not ask about their state of mind, even though doctors are meant to check for post-natal depression.

Nearly half of new mums said their six-week post-natal check was not thorough enough, with one in five saying it lasted less than five minutes

A fifth claimed they 'put on a brave face', too embarrassed to admit that they were struggling with motherhood.

The consultations are offered on the NHS six weeks after labour to check that women are recovering physically and emotionally, and coping with caring for their babies.

GPs are meant to weigh women, check their blood pressure, test their urine for kidney infections and ask a series of questions about their wellbeing. But a survey of 4,000 new mothers by the National Childbirth Trust found 45 per cent thought the checks were substandard.

Another 43 per cent said their GP did not understand their circumstances and 7 per cent wanted to talk about how they were coping emotionally but ran out of time.

One mother, Lyssie, from Leeds, said her GP was abrasive and made her feel a nuisance, adding: 'As a first-time mum I felt rushed and as if I was a nuisance. I felt as if I couldn't possibly ask, 'Is this normal?'.

'I had some questions but I didn't feel comfortable to ask them due to the GP's manner.'

Another, Allie, from London, said: 'There was no consideration of the difficult labour I had gone through and impact it may have had on me psychologically.'

NCT chief executive Belinda Phipps said: 'The check-up is a key opportunity to spot potential problems. Post-natal depression can develop from this stage, as well as other physical and psychological disorders.

'So it is worrying that almost a third of women were not even asked about how they felt. Identification early on is crucial.'

Common problems that should be picked up include difficulty in shedding pregnancy weight, or going too far the other way and developing eating disorders as mums try to regain their figure.

The checks are also an invaluable opportunity for mothers to admit they are struggling with breastfeeding, or seek advice on how to settle their baby.

Cathy Ranson, editor in chief of the website Netmums, said: 'The check is a vital safety net, but this system isn't working. Investing a little more time and money could pick up serious emotional and psychological issues much earlier, saving the NHS millions in treatment costs later.'
