Like any professional secret service agent, Jordan seems to have bounced straight back after sustaining some injuries on the job.

The brave Belgian Malnois was one of two K-9's that took down White House intruder Dominic Adesanya, 23, who scaled the north fence and sprinted across the lawn on Wednesday night in a bid to reach the executive mansion, where President Obama and the first family were at the time.

Jordan and fellow dog Hurricane, who can both sprint 25 miles per hour and have a bite that applies hundreds of pounds of pressure per square inch, quickly took down the Maryland man, who suffers from mental problems and was arrested two months earlier for another White House security breach.

Adesanya tried to fight off the police dogs, kicking Jordan in the snout and slamming Hurricane to the ground before punching him repeatedly.

Job well done: Jordan, left, and Hurricane, right, have returned to work after stopping a White House intruder on Wednesday. The dogs were treated for minor bruises after the intruder kicked and punched them

They were treated for minor bruises, but have now headed back to work, the Secret Service said.

On Friday, a dog believed to be Hurricane was seen back on the job outside the White House.

The K-9 eagerly answered orders from a minder and appeared to be injury-free. 

On Thursday, White House press secretary Josh Earnest praised the agents' response, saying, 'Yesterday's incident underscores the professionalism of the Secret Service.' 

As the agency shared photos of the dogs on Twitter, it revealed that Jordan, a five-year-old black and tan Belgian Malinois, 'enjoys walks around White House'. 

Stopped: Dominic Adesanya, who has a history of mental illness, remains in police custody

Hurricane, a six-year-old black Belgian Malinois, 'enjoys playing with his Kong toy', the Twitter feed said. The agency noted both are 'ready to work'.

Adesanya, from Bel Air, Maryland, is in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and has been charged with felony assault on a police officer for hurting the dogs. He is being held without bond.

He was unarmed when he tried to reach the White House.

After his arrest, his father revealed that Adesanya had the paranoid belief he was being watched by cameras and had previously been arrested at the executive mansion. 

He was arrested on July 27 and ordered to undergo mental health screening. Court records show he told an officer that he wanted cameras that had been placed in his home removed.

The document also says he told an officer that the security barrier he jumped over 'was easy and that the next fence to the south grounds of the White House would not be a problem as well.'

After the arrest he was ordered to get outpatient mental health screening

He was apprehended again on July 30 after he refused to leave the Treasury building,  next to the White House, and swung his fists at officers.

Cruel: Video footage captured Adesanya kicking one of the dogs and punching another on the lawn

Dogs have been working for the Secret Service since 1975. The agency trains Belgian Malinois, like Hurricane and Jordan.

While the breed is known for its gentle nature, the dogs can also run 30 miles and have a 270-degree field of vision, making them effective at hunting down targets.

They resemble small German shepherds and their short hair allows them to work well in the heat. One was used in the team that cornered Osama bin Laden in 2011.

Secret Service dogs must complete 20 weeks of training with handlers before they can report for duty. They complete eight hours a week of refresher training once they're on the job.

On average, they work until they are about 10. This means that Hurricane, who's six, and Jordan, who's five, have a few more years of work left in them yet.

He was supposed to return to court  but didn't show up and warrants for his arrest were issued.

His father, Victor Adesanya, said in a telephone interview that his son has been experiencing mental health problems for over a year, but he refused the help the family tried to get for him.

Victor Adesanya said his son was diagnosed with paranoia and schizophrenia and 'complained about cameras everywhere.'

He said at one point his son took down a mirror in the bathroom and cut into the wall, trying to find a camera. He also looked for them in the family's attic. He said his son was not trying to hurt the president.

'He's not violent. He's not a criminal. He's not a murderer. He's just someone that's just mentally disturbed,' he said. 

The incident came about a month after a previous White House fence jumper, Omar Gonzalez, sprinted across the same lawn carrying a knife, ran past armed uniformed agents and entered the mansion before being felled in the ceremonial East Room and taken into custody.

This week a federal judge delayed his arraignment because of questions about his mental fitness. Friends and family said the veteran was suffering from PTSD due to service abroad.

The embarrassing  incident preceded the disclosure of other serious Secret Service breaches in security for Obama and ultimately led to Julia Pierson's resignation as director of the agency after 18 months on the job.

Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who has been leading congressional investigations into the Secret Service, commended the swift response Wednesday night.

But he said more needed to be known about Dominic Adesanya, including whether he was doing anything suspicious immediately before the incident that should have led to his detection.

Chaffetz also suggested changes might be needed to 'maximize the pain of going over the fence.'

'It seems a little too easy to get over,' he said.
