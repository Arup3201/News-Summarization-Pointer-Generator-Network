A South Australian woman was guilt-ridden about carrying out sexual acts on her young son and a dog, a court has been told.

The woman had never been in trouble with the law, came from a very stable and loving home, had no school behavioural problems and had worked for the same employer for 20 years.

Nothing emerged from her background which would have indicated she would ever commit such offences, he said in the District Court on Friday. 

The South Australian woman was guilt-ridden about carrying out sexual acts on her young son and a dog

The 36-year-old woman and the boy's 34-year-old father, from regional South Australia, have pleaded guilty to persistent sexual exploitation of a child and aggravated counts of producing and possessing child pornography between March 2011 and January 2012.

The woman, who can't be named for legal reasons, also has admitted one count of bestiality.

Prosecutor Stephanie Borek said that in January 2012 police received information about an account in the woman's name which was used to access child exploitation material.

Police seized a computer from the couple's house, noting their four-year-old son was present.

But the parents were not arrested until April 2014, after the material was discovered on the computer.

Ms Borek said two separate incidents were depicted of the mother performing sexual acts on her son and another on a small Jack Russell terrior.

The images were stored on the computer in a file titled the woman's name followed by the word 'incest'.

In November 2011, the boy had disclosed to a deputy-principal that he had seen his mother perform oral sex on his father who had taken him into their bedroom.

This demonstrated that the offences had occurred in the context of the victim being exposed to sexualised behaviour, Ms Borek said.

Judge Julie McIntyre agreed 'regrettably' to Ms Borek's application that she view the images to grasp the full extent of the offending.

Ms Borek said the parents had tried to play down their actions in their interviews with psychologists.

Both defence lawyers said the images, which were 'fairly disturbing in nature', were well described in written material.

The sentence hearing is continuing.
