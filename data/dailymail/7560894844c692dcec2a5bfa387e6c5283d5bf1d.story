A craftswoman who heard an 'almighty crash' as she vacuumed was shocked when she saw two cows had toppled through the roof of her home, crushing her furniture.

Sue Marshall had been was cleaning the converted barn where she lives when she was rocked by an 'almighty crash'.

Ms Marshall, a professional weaver, feared a tree had fallen onto the workshop of her property in Lamorna, near Penzance, Cornwall.

However, when the 77-year-old entered the room she saw a cow stood in the workshop 
after it fell through her roof and flattened a table and chairs.

Ms Marshall managed to shoo the beast out of her property, but just minutes later a 
second cow, who had followed the first, fell through another part of the 
roof.

The two animals crushed the majority of the furniture in the room but narrowly avoided the weaver's expensive loom.

Ms Marshall said: 'I was hoovering at the time and heard an almighty crash. I assumed that a tree had come down.

'I
was astonished to find that a cow had fallen through the roof of the 
workshop, narrowly missing my loom and leaving a huge hole in the roof.

'No sooner had I let the startled animal out than another one fell through another part of the roof.

'Both cows narrowly missed the loom, which was incredibly fortunate, and neither was injured. I was in absolute shock.'

The animals had been grazing in a neighbouring farmer's field before they climbed onto the sloped roof to get to greener grass.

Mrs
Marshall said the first cow was 'extremely eager' to leave and ran out 
the back door - but its companion was more reluctant to go.

She
added: 'The cows were clearly distressed, the first careered out of the
yard into an adjacent field, the second decided to hang around and made
a bit of mess of the garden.

'I
looked up at the fence and saw the rest of the herd looking on, a 
helpful neighbour came to our aid and made sure no more came through the
fence.'

The two cows 
caused thousands of pounds worth of damage but luckily Ms Marshall was able to 
make a claim was against the farmer's insurance.

Alan
Goddard, managing director of insurers Cornish Mutual, said: 'This very
unusual case really does highlight the importance of keeping boundary 
fences in good condition.

Damage: The animals tore a hole through the roof of Ms Marshall's workshop and flattened much of her furniture, although fortunately they missed her expensive loom

'Fortunately no one was physically harmed and neither of the cows suffered any injuries.

'Livestock
owners are potentially liable through common law and statute for 
accidents caused by animals straying, so land or animal owners should 
ensure that all fences are kept in reasonable order at all times.'

The farmer responsible for the cows has now put a new fence in place to stop further animals trying to escape.
