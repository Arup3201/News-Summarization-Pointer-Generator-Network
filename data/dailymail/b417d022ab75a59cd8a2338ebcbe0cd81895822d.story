When French actor Gerard Depardieu surprised locals by popping in for a dram at a small pub on the Isle of Skye, not everyone was toasting his health.

While Depardieu was pictured enjoying the range of local whiskies and beer at the Am Oraban Bar on the Sleat peninsula, the Edinburgh International Film Festival was expecting him at a red carpet screening of his new movie hours later.

However, Depardieu mysteriously failed to depart for Edinburgh and disappointed organisers were forced to announce that their star attraction had pulled out at the last moment.

Social media sites were immediately rife with speculation as to what may have befallen the veteran of 170 films, who at 65 still enjoys something of a reputation as a hellraiser.

One tweeted: 'Gerard Depardieu was in a Skye pub last night bid didn't make it to @edfilmfest tonight. Wonder why?'

The star of Green Card and Cyrano de Bergerac pulled out shortly after being pictured during a visit to the Am Praban Bar at the Hotel Eilean Iarmain on Friday night.

Pictures on social media show Depardieu sampling beer, whisky, haggis and bagpipes while filming a French TV series on Scottish food and drink.

A posting on the Sleat, Perfectly Skye Facebook page, said Depardieu 'clearly enjoyed tasting the range of Gaelic whiskies' and tried 'haggis, washed down with a dram and a pint of Skye Gold from the Isle of Skye Brewery.'

The posting added: 'The arrival of a ten-strong photography and support team was a surprise to visitors and locals enjoying an early evening drink and many of those had their photographs taken with the iconic actor.

'Great news for Sleat, with the film crew choosing to enjoy our fabulous hotels, food and drink.'

The following night, Depardieu was due to appear as a guest of honour at the UK premiere of his film Welcome To New York.

The raunchy drama about an international financier with 'monstrous sexual appetites' has been enthusiastically trailed by the film festival on its website.

But at 1.30pm on Sunday, the festival posted a notice stating: 'It is with regret that we have to announce that Gerard Depardieu has cancelled his appearance this evening.'

A spokesman said organisers had been given no further details as to why the actor had pulled out, but added: 'He has let the festival down very badly.'

The spokesman added that the festival was aware of photos posted on Facebook of their star attraction pouring himself a pint, but added: 'We won't be pursuing this any further because the screening has already taken place - but there is some annoyance here over his failure to attend.'

Depardieu, who has described himself as 'someone who is a bit of a rebel, who shakes things up and who is sometimes drunk', was not available for comment.

The veteran actor, who also runs a successful parallel career as a wine-grower, has long been known for his drink-fuelled excesses and unpredictable behaviour.

In 2011, he was thrown off a plane from Paris to Dublin after relieving himself in the aisle in full view of other passengers.

In an interview on US television he later protested: 'I'm not a monster. I'm just a man who wants to pee.' Asked if he was drunk at the time, and if there was 'any wine involved,' the actor replied: 'No'.

Last year he was banned from driving for six months and fined 4,000 euros (£3,204) after he fell off his scooter in Paris and was arrested for driving while intoxicated.

In January, the actor was reported to police for allegedly hurling buckets of water on customers in a bar beneath his holiday home in the southern Italian city of Lecce. He is said to have lost his temper in a row over noise.

The following night, Depardieu, who took Russian citizenship in protest at proposed French tax rates of 75 per cent, poured water over drinkers, the Quotidiano Puglia newspaper reported.
