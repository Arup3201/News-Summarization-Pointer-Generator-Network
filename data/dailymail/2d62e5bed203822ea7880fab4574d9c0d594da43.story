Zlatan Ibrahimovic continued his return to form with his second goal in a week as Paris Saint-Germain beat Nice 1-0 on Saturday to stay within one point of Ligue 1 leaders Marseille.

Ibrahimovic, who missed nearly two months of the season with a heel injury, slotted a penalty into the bottom corner in the 15th minute after Brazilian winger Lucas Moura had been bundled over.

The Sweden star also got PSG's second of the game in a 3-1 win against Ajax in the Champions League on Tuesday.

Ibrahimovic, the league's top scorer for the past two seasons, has scored six league goals so far this campaign but he had not netted in Ligue 1 since a hat-trick against Saint-Etienne on August 31.

Marseille beat Nantes 2-0 on Friday night and they sit top of the table with 34 points after 15 games.

But 33-year-old Ibrahimovic has scored an array of spectacular goals during a distinguished career and he almost added another early on against Nice.

In the 10th minute, he took down a high ball in his stride with a superb piece of control and then clipped a first-time shot against the post.

PSG are now unbeaten in 21 games this season and have not lost since a 2-1 home defeat to Rennes on May 7.

However, after a bright start, this match became another scrappy performance from a PSG side who regularly struggle to break teams down, despite boasting a glut of attacking talent.

PSG faded in the second half, as has often been the case this season, and struggled to create a chance until Edinson Cavani headed over Serge Aurier's cross in the 74th minute.

With Nice gaining in confidence, a draw seemed increasingly likely, and left back Jordan Amavi hit the post with a header from a free kick with 10 minutes to go.
