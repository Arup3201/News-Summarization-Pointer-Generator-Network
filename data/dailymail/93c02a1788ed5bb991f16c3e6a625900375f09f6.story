The headlines trumpeted the alarming news this week 'Births to mums over 50 soaring!'

I had three radio stations call me before 9 am - despite being almost a decade younger, it seems I'm becoming something of a figurehead for the distasteful trend of the older mum.

And unless you were living under a rock this week, you will be familiar with new statistics indicating that the number of women over 50 having babies has more than doubled in the past five years.

Ashley Pearson is sick of hearing people criticise women who become first time mums over 50

It's still only 154 births in the entire nation in a year so it's not like it's COMMON, but still it clearly upsets people.

Indeed, naturally, just below the headline, even before you got the article were 'helpful' bullet points on all the dangers of this distressing phenomenon.

It was like they were reporting on an outbreak of some new deadly strain of swine flu.

'Older mums are more at risk of miscarriage!' 'Babies born to older mums are more at risk of genetic health problems!' 'This Will Cause a Tremendous Strain on the NHS.'

And you know what? That's really what this is all about.

I had an email from a friend in New York following one of my many articles in defense of the older mother - and she reiterated something that I know to be true. 

Star of Shameless, Tina Malone, recently gave birth to her daughter, Flame, at the age of 50

As an older mum herself, she wrote, 'This just doesn't happen this way in America. They are really positive about the whole subject here. It's like "if you can do it, good for you!" They seem to really go after the 40 years and older mom in the UK. I don't understand it.'

I'm starting to think that I do.

In the US, if a woman becomes a mother in her 40s and requires more care, a higher risk of caesarean section,  and a few extra scans it's a cost, at least up until now, handled by her insurance company.

Here, it's bourne by the UK tax payer. And let's face it, no one wants to pay for your decision to leave it 'too late.'

To this, I would like to say a few things.

Ashley says that American attitudes towards older mothers are completely different to those in the UK

I don't want to pay for your lung cancer after you chose to smoke, or your diabetes medication after you chose to eat poorly for 20 years.

I don't wish to pay for the seven children you conceived but cannot financially support, or the cigarettes and alcohol you spend benefit money on.

I don't want to support your lifestyle when you claim you are too depressed to find a job, or pay for your subsidised housing when your children harass the neighbours.

But that's just me.

In any case, I don't get actually get a choice in the matter.

And even more significantly, what I wish people would understand is that the vast majority of these 'older mums' are not in this category by choice.

Are they really a brigade of selfish, career-obsessed women too fussy in their choice of partners and too focused on personal freedoms to adequately address their declining fertile years? You may think so - but I can assure you, they are not.

The vast majority of women in this group are those who waited until they could financially support a child, as well as making sure they had a supportive and appropriate partner.

Which in today's world can often feel impossible and is certainly harder than it sounds.

Of course there will be challenges being an older mum - both physically and emotionally. Anyone who says that 40 or 50 is an ideal time to have a baby should have their head examined.

Biologically ideal is probably around 16 years old - in every other way it's probably closer to 30 - but the reality is, many of us just don't get to choose.

For the women out there who read this latest study and felt judged, let me say this, again:  Don't let the haters get you down.

Live your life, Find love where you can, and Do what you have to do if motherhood is important to you. Don't let anyone critique your choices, because simply put, they clearly haven't walked a mile in your middle-aged shoes.
