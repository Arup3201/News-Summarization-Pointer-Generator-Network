The FIA has decided to ban all radio transmissions at future grands prix deemed to help the driver with his on-track performance.

Messages from drivers asking for advice on driving style, or from the teams informing their drivers on how and where to make gains during a qualifying session or race, have become increasingly commonplace.

But motorsport's world governing body is to now strictly enforce one of the sporting regulations that states: 'The driver must drive the car alone and unaided.'

FIA have banned radio communication concerning car or driver performance between teams and drivers 

A directive from FIA race director Charlie Whiting has been issued to all the teams confirming the clampdown.

The directive states: 'In order to ensure the requirements of Article 20.1 of the F1 sporting regulations are respected at all times, the FIA intends to rigorously enforce this regulation with immediate effect.

'Therefore, no radio conversation from pit to driver may include any information that is related to the performance of the car or driver.

The ban does not include advice with regard to pit-stop strategies or anything related to safety

'The FIA should also remind you data transmission from pit to car is specifically prohibited by Article 8.5.2 of the F1 technical regulations.'

The ban does not include advice with regard to pit-stop strategies or safety, nor with regard to general messages between pit and driver, a number of which have often been dramatic and have proven an integral part of the show.
