The independent retailers of Louth have long known they can count on locals for support.

Now there’s something else they can rely on them for – foiling armed robberies.

In a remarkable display of  ‘people power’, the townsfolk banded together to thwart two career criminals who had raided a jewellery shop

Smash and grab: As London and Clark smashed through glass cabinets in the jewellery store, dozens of passers-by were gathering outside, the action caught on CCTV

A retired businessman stood his ground after one of the robbers stabbed him in the eyebrow, passers-by swiped the keys to their getaway vehicle and a travel agent yelled: ‘Who do you think you are, Bonnie and Clyde?’

Christopher London, 25, and Damion Clark, 30, were both jailed yesterday after a court heard how the people of Louth – recently voted Britain’s favourite market town – had stopped them in their tracks.

The pair, from Grimsby, raided the Lincolnshire town’s Eastgate Jewellers in June. They wore motorbike helmets, and were armed with claw hammers and a knife.

But they hadn’t reckoned on the presence of mind and courage of owner Julie Smith, who pressed an alarm which locked them all in the shop.

Left 'high and dry': The court heard how residents of Louth banded together, forcing the robbers to escape on foot

As the robbers began smashing up cabinets, two passers-by came to help, standing guard outside the doors. Mrs Smith ran to her flat upstairs, but the raiders chased her and dragged her back down before forcing her to unlock the doors.

But when the raiders made it outside, they found they had been left ‘high and dry’ by passers-by who had taken the keys to their motorbike and knocked it over.

Clark fled to a car park where he attempted to drag Eric Chapman out of his car, Lincoln Crown Court heard. When the retired businessman refused, Clark stabbed him in the eyebrow – but Mr Chapman still ‘did not budge,’ the judge said, describing him as ‘made of stern stuff’.

Clark was soon detained by other members of the public, including a retired policeman. 

London fled towards Kidgate Primary Academy school, where he was confronted by deputy head teacher Paul Lidbury. He fled, and was later arrested in a back garden. 

People power: The criminals, wearing their motorbike helmets, were confronted by dozens of passing shoppers and traders. Two passers-by guarded the shop door while another kicked the pair's getaway bike over

Prosecutor Jon Straw said: ‘This is a very remarkable example of people power. The people of the town banded together and the motorbike they intended to use for their escape was pushed over by a passer-by and the keys taken.

‘They were left high and dry and had to flee on foot.’

Terry Robinson, a travel agent, was one of those who gathered outside the shop. He said: ‘One of them came out shouting “Keep back and no one will get hurt”. I shouted “Who do you think you are, Bonnie and Clyde?”’

Crime scene: After the robbers fled on foot they came across more resistance from locals which led to their arrests and jail sentences

Clark admitted robbery and unlawful wounding. He also asked for 17 other offences to be taken into consideration.

Judge Sean Morris branded him ‘dangerous’ and sentenced him to six years in jail with an extended three-and-a-half years on licence.

London, who pleaded guilty to robbery and also asked for 12 other offences to be taken into account, was jailed for four years.

Judge Morris told them: ‘When you forced that lady to open the door the good citizens of Lincolnshire had disabled your getaway vehicle, your motorbike, so you had to make a run for it.’

Louth has fought hard to retain its independent retail scene rather than become a ‘clone town’ full of chain stores.

It was named Britain’s favourite market town in a poll by BBC Countryfile Magazine last year.
