Texas Governor Rick Perry, the new 
face in the race for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, has 
already jumped to a double-digit lead over Mitt Romney and Michele 
Bachmann with the other announced candidates trailing even further 
behind.

The latest Rasmussen Reports national
telephone survey of Likely Republican Primary voters, taken on Monday 
night, finds Mr Perry with 29 per cent support.

Mr Romney, the former Massachusetts 
governor who ran unsuccessfully for the GOP presidential nomination in 
2008, has 18 per cent of the vote, while Mrs Bachmann, the Minnesota 
congresswoman who won the high-profile Ames Straw Poll in Iowa on 
Saturday, picks up 13 per cent.

Corn dog trail: It appears to be becoming a tradition for front runners to scoff on the fatty treats

Texas Congressman Ron Paul, who was a close second to Bachmann on Saturday, has the support of nine per cent of likely primary voters, followed by Georgia businessman Herman Cain on six per cent and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich with five per cent. Rick Santorum, former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, and ex-Utah Governor Jon Huntsman each get one per cent support.

The poll figutes were released as Mr Perry hit the campaign trail, slamming Barack Obama by claiming the country needs a president who is 'in love with America'.

After announcing his bid on Saturday, the 61-year-old Texas governor gave the country a taste of what's to come at the Iowa State Fair, signing autographs and scoffing on finger food while boldly declaring his love for the U.S.A.

Hungry; Rick Perry got stuck in to the campaign trail while tucking in to a pork chop

'I think you want a president who is passionate about America - that’s in love with America,' Perry said during the visit on Monday.

When he was asked by a journalist in Iowa later on Monday at a Republican Party event if he was insinuating that President Obama does not love America, Perry said: 'You need to ask him. I’m saying, you’re a good reporter, go ask him.'

The Rasmussen Reports poll marks a significant jump in support for Mr Perry.

Just over two weeks ago, a survey of likely primary voters found Romney with 22 per cent support, closely followed by Perry at 18 per cent and Bachman with 16 per cent of the vote. 

Scott Rasmussen said: 'Governor Perry is enjoying a bounce from entering the race at precisely the right time.

Bold: Perry spoke of his deep love for America - and questioned whether the President feels the same

'Now the difficult part begins for the new frontrunner.

'It’s much easier winning support when people are hoping you will get in the race, than retaining support when you are the frontrunner.' After months of speculation, Perry 
joined the presidential race on Saturday, announcing his bid at a 
conservative conference in Charleston, South
Carolina. He said at the time that America isn't broken but the government in the nation's 
capital is and blamed President Obama for 
'rudderless' leadership.

At
a Republican Party meet-and-greet he fiercely criticised Obama's jobs 
record, as the President spoke at a town hall meeting 100 miles away in 
Decorah, Iowa.

I'm hungry too! Perry slammed Barack Obama, who was spotted yesterday with a pie

'He’s gonna talk about jobs,' Perry said. 'But I think the only job he cares about is the one he’s got.

'I
think it’s fair for Iowans to ask the president tomorrow, where are the
jobs that you promised, Mr. President? That’s a fair question to ask 
this man.'

He added that 
Obama was, in his opinion, the 'greatest threat to our country' and 
spoke out about his own record of job creation in Texas, boasting that 
his state has 'the strongest economy in the nation'.

'What’s going on in Washington, DC is stunning,' he said. 'Stunningly bad.'

He was also caught on videotape saying the prospect of the Federal Reserve chairman 'printing more money' was 'almost treasonous'.

'If this guy prints more money between now and the election, I dunno what y’all would do to him in Iowa but we would treat him pretty ugly down in Texas.

'Printing more money to play politics
at this particular time in American history is almost treacherous - I 
mean treasonous - in my opinion.'

Speaking of his plans for the Iowa 
caucuses, Perry said: 'We’re going to be spending a lot of time here 
over the course of the next months. You all do it not unlike running for
agriculture commissioner back in Texas in 1990. A lot of probin’ and 
lot of feelin’ and touchin’ and talkin’ and vetting the candidates and 
asking questions … it is a good process.'

True to form, Perry was photographed in Iowa almost constantly eating on some form of finger food.

As he signed autographs and mingled with his supporters, he snacked on pork chops on a stick and corn dogs, among other foods.

Announcing
his bid on Saturday, Perry said: 'It is time to get America working 
again. That's why with the support of my family and an unwavering belief
in the goodness of America, I declare to you today my candidacy for 
president of the United States.'

The
conservative three-term Texas governor has touted a record of job 
growth in Texas and also is known as a strident critic of federal power 
and an opponent of abortion rights and gay marriage. He is considered a 
strong fundraiser.

Bid: Perry declared his candidacy on Saturday after months of speculation as to whether he would run

Opinion polls indicate Perry entered the race close on the heels of former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the early front-runner to win the 2012 Republican nomination. Meanwhile, Tea Party favourite Michele Bachmann made her case this week, winning the Iowa straw poll.

The announcement by Perry, who has made his deep Christian faith a big part of his public image, came one week after he led a seven-hour religious rally in Houston to pray for America, a nation he described as 'in crisis.'

On Monday, he said despite delays in announcing his bid 'we’re gonna campaign like our life 
depends on it. You can count on it in Iowa and New Hampshire and South 
Carolina - across this country.'
