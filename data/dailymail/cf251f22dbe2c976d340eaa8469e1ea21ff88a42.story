Australia’s new prime minister immediately set to work yesterday on a right-wing policy agenda that many Tories could only dream of carrying out in Britain.

Hours after defeating the ruling Labor party, British-born Tony Abbott slipped into cycling gear for a ride through Sydney’s suburbs – and then got straight down to business.

Top of the list is implementing his promise to get tough on immigration by ‘turning back’ the asylum boats bringing refugees to the country, while pledging to slash Australia’s foreign aid budget.

After winning, British-born Tony Abbott got straight down to business....

The 55-year-old Oxford graduate also said one of his first moves would be to reverse the climate change consensus by scrapping taxes on carbon emissions.

The resounding victory for the conservative Liberal leader was applauded by media magnate Rupert Murdoch, who controls up to 70 per cent of the newspaper market in Australia.

He tweeted: ‘Aust election public sick of public sector workers and phony welfare scroungers sucking life out of economy.’

And in an intriguing prediction, Mr Murdoch added: ‘Others nations to follow in time.’

Among
the first to congratulate Mr Abbott by phone was David Cameron, who 
later wrote on Twitter that it would ‘be great to work with another 
centre-right leader’.

The two men spoke for several minutes, agreeing to talk later in more detail about policy issues.

Dressed in stunning white gowns, it was Tony Abbott’s three daughters who stole the limelight following his election victory.

But it was no surprise to their father, who is  accused of using their looks to win votes.

In one TV appearance last week, he was accused of sexism and misogyny when he said: ‘If you want to know who to vote for, I’m the guy with the not bad-looking daughters.’ 

However, the trio have been keen to support their father in his election campaign.

In the final days, UN worker Louise, 24, returned from Geneva to join Frances, 22, who worked with underprivileged groups, and 20-year-old university student Bridget.

A Roman Catholic, in 2010 he was asked for his views on the idea of preserving virginity until marriage.

He replied: ‘I think I would say to my daughters … it is the greatest gift that you can give someone, the ultimate gift of giving, and don’t give it to someone lightly.’

Mr
Abbott said he would overturn many of the failed policies of the last 
government after scoring a landslide victory over Kevin Rudd’s turbulent
Labor party, which had been in power since 2007.

There
are predictions that when the counting is over the Liberals will have 
won close to 90 seats in the 150-seat House of Representatives.

‘Australia is again open for business,’ Mr Abbott declared as he posed 
victoriously with his three daughters and his wife, Margaret.

But
as the celebrations died down it was time to roll up his sleeves, 
assemble his public service chiefs and promise to ‘hit the ground 
running’.

Mr Abbott 
said his government would swiftly implement a measure he has termed 
‘operation sovereign borders’, aimed at intercepting Indonesian fishing 
vessels carrying asylum-seekers.

The navy will be ordered to stop craft as soon as they enter Australian waters and promptly turn them round.

The strategist who ensured Tony Abbott was elected on a right-wing ticket has links to David Cameron, it emerged last night.

Mark Textor is the business partner of Lynton Crosby – the Prime Minister’s controversial campaign guru and the man the Tories hope will secure the general election in 2015.

The Australian pair set up consultancy Crosby Textor in 2002 and expert pollster Mr Textor has been a close adviser to Mr Abbott for several years.

His strategies ensured Mr Abbott’s Liberal party made major gains in 2010 and he wrote the ‘We will stop the boats’ mantra for the current election campaign.

Mr Crosby, known as the ‘Wizard of Oz’, masterminded successive election triumphs for former Australian PM John Howard and is known for using controversial social issues such as immigration to connect with the unspoken concerns of voters.

The
policy has been described as ‘crazy’ by opponents, but to many in 
Australia Mr Abbott is a refreshing ‘Action Man’ compared to the ‘nerdy’
Mr Rudd.

Born in London, he moved Down Under with his Australian parents when he was almost three.

A
graduate in economics and law at the University of Sydney, he returned 
to Britain to study politics and philosophy at Oxford as a Rhodes 
Scholar.

There, he earned a ‘blue’ in boxing and was also a keen champion of Margaret Thatcher.

On
his return to Australia, he trained briefly as a Catholic priest, 
earning the nickname ‘the Mad Monk’, before becoming a key figure in the
Liberal Party.

He served as employment minister in John Howard’s government between 1998 and 2003.

Many accused him of being gaffe-prone and mocked his tendency to punctuate sentences with drawn-out ‘ehs’.

But as opposition leader, he watched Labor implode before successfully staking his claim to Australia’s highest office.

'Clear win': Tony Abbott,  Australia's next Prime
Minister, watched as his daughters Bridget, Frances and Louise and his 
wife Margie cast their votes in Sydney

Conservative Tony Abbott: Australia's next Prime Minister

All it took was an unpopular 
government bloodied by infighting, relentless cheerleading from media 
mogul Rupert Murdoch and a multibillion-dollar campaign promise aimed at
the women he has frequently alienated.

Tony Abbotthas never been very popular nationally. His Liberal Party colleagues elected him their leader by just a single vote in 2009.

The 55-year-old conservative was
notoriously branded 'a misogynist' and 'sexist' by Australia's first 
woman prime minister, Julia Gillard, in a speech to Parliament in 2012 
that was lauded by feminists around the world.

Married
with three grown daughters, Abbott is a supremely fit volunteer surf 
lifesaver and firefighter whom cartoonists often depict in nothing but 
Speedos and the iconic red-and-yellow cap of the Australian lifeguard.

Ever
the action man, he was an amateur boxer at Oxford University, where he 
was a Rhodes Scholar. He's also known for using his fists at Sydney 
University: In a fight over rugby, He knocked out Joe Hockey - now a 
lawmaker poised to take over the treasury portfolio in an Abbott 
government.

A student 
newspaper editor took a 20-year-old Abbott to court, accusing him of 
groping her during a student debate in 1977. A magistrate dismissed the 
indecent assault charge. Last year, an old political rival from his 
university days alleged that he punched a wall next to her head in an 
attempt to intimidate her, which Abbott denied.

Abbott
spent three years in a Sydney seminary training to become a Roman 
Catholic priest. That experience, his family name and his conservative 
views inspired a nickname: 'The Mad Monk'.

He
has said his religion does not dictate his decisions and that a 
government led by him would not change a decision made by the Labor 
government in June to provide taxpayer subsidies for mifepristone.

During the election, Abbott attempted to reinvent himself as a champion of women who is not beholden to Catholic doctrine.

His
chief of staff, Peta Credlin, said in an interview with the women's 
magazine Marie Claire that Abbott supported her efforts to have a child 
through in vitro fertilization - which is opposed by the church - and 
even allowed her to keep her fertility drugs in his office refrigerator.

What Abbott refers to 
as his signature policy of the campaign is a paid maternity leave plan 
that would cost 5.5 billion Australian dollars ($5 billion) a year. It 
has proved to be one of the campaign's most divisive policies. Even 
Abbott's allies complain that it is unaffordable and too generous toward
the wealthy.

Mothers 
would get the taxpayer-funded equivalent of their salaries for six 
months to stay home with newborns. Currently, the government gives new 
mothers 18 weeks of minimum-wage pay: AU$622.10 a week.

The
proposed benefit would be capped at AU$75,000, regardless of how 
wealthy mothers are. Labor dismisses it as 'AU$75,000 for millionaires.'
