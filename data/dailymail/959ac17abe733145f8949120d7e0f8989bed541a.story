Trapped in a sinking car, your commanding officer, Dunn - whose leg is uncompromisingly wedged in the wreckage - passes you his gun and orders you to shoot out the window.

The windscreen starts to crack as the pressure increases. Your other two comrades are screaming at you to ignore his pleas but you know what must be done. Raising the weapon, you fire before the screen goes black.

Life-like: DICE says that the Frostbite 3 engine allows for more realistic animations and the level of detail is some of the best we've seen. This is to complement a much more emotional story

Welcome to Battlefield 4. Or, as the gameplay demonstration would have us believe, Medal of Duty: Warfighter Ops III. Indeed, although absolutely stunning to look at, it was impossible to ignore both Call of Duty's and the (late) Medal of Honor series' influence on Battlefield 4's level structure and gameplay.

Namely, the frequent set-pieces (which sees helicopters explode in slow-motion, car chases, more helicopters exploding), the soundtrack, the Hollywood talent (none other than The Wire's Michael K. Williams) and an overarching emphasis on developing bonds with your team-mates. No matter, as COD is a proven winning formula. 

In Battlefield 4, based in the same universe as its predecessor, you play Recker - part of the Tombstone squad. The demo, which showed off the game's prologue, sees the team in Azerbaijan, trying to escape while under fire from Russian soldiers.

Immediately evident are the environments, which art director Gustav Tilleby calls an 'agresssive world'. Interestingly, the overall look has been inspired by car adverts - creating bright, dynamic worlds that contrast with the dark subject matter.

Everything in the environment reacts to each other, too. The Frostbite 3 engine allows particles, foliage and cloth to be affected by explosions as well as standard-fare destructive environments.

Aggressive world: Interestingly, the art director has said that car adverts inspired the overall look of the game. The entire demo had a Hollywood sheen which made the battlegrounds look more inviting

Thankfully, unlike in Battlefield 3, the single-player makes the most out of these. You can use explosions to create new paths, then use the new 'designate target' function and get your team to cover your flanking maneuver.

DICE have made it clear that multiplayer has had a huge impact on the single-player campaign - offering the freedom of movement and choice many thought was missing from the previous game.

Also improved are the vehicle sections. The demo saw the player driving two cars - a 4x4 and armed buggy (although the lack of animation when both entering the car and using the on-board turret was less than impressive), while the teaser trailer clearly showed you in control of a dinghy alongside a large aircraft carrier.

Unfortunately, the 17-minute demo footage was most likely using a high-powered PC so if the game was to arrive on current gen, visuals will look noticeably worse.

There is no date penned for release although it is expected to arrive at the end of the year.
