Growing resistance to antibiotics could lead to a tipping point where new infections are able to take hold in the UK, warns the director of the Wellcome Trust.

Professor Jeremy Farrar said everyday medical practice would be affected because the ‘golden age of antibiotics’ was set to end.

But the change would be gradual rather than the sudden emergence of new deadly bugs, he said.

‘This is happening now’ Prof Farrar told the BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.

‘It’s been happening for the last decade or so or more and it will continue to happen.

‘What we will see is people actually spending longer in hospital, patients getting sicker and having complications and dying and it will creep up on us almost without us noticing.

‘This will not be the sort of contagion-like event of somebody landing from Hong Kong in London with a pneumonia that we’ve all feared.

‘This will creep is on us insidiously, and of course that’s in many ways more difficult to cope with’.

He said complacency had set in during the 1970s and 1980s where there should have been more investment and antibiotics could have been used more wisely, for example in combination to deter resistance.

Professor Jeremy Farrar said everyday medical practice would be affected while last year England’s chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies warned resistance to antibiotics was a ‘ticking time bomb’

Prof Farrar, making his first major contribution as the new head of Britain’s biggest medical research charity, is the latest expert to warn of impending disaster from antibiotic resistance.

Last year, England’s chief medical officer Professor Dame Sally Davies warned that resistance to antibiotics was a ‘ticking time bomb’ and one of the greatest threats to modern health.

She said many of the drugs are being used unnecessarily for mild infections or illnesses which should not be treated with antibiotics - which is helping to create resistance.

Around half of people in the UK do not know that antibiotics are inappropriate to treat colds, flu and viruses, according to evidence given yesterday (wed) to the Commons Science and Technology Committee.

Public Health England’s director of public health strategy, Professor Anthony Kessel, said improving public awareness was critical.

He said ‘My team have been asked to look at whether we can run a broader public health campaign about antimicrobial resistance in this country.’

The committee was also told there should be more research into the most effective duration of a course of antibiotics in a bid to reach the best and shortest level.

Prof Farrar said there were just four pharmaceutical companies working on antibiotics now - compared to 18 companies in the commercial sector 20 years ago.

As a result only five new classes of antibiotics had emerged in the past 10 years.

He called for more imaginative ways to incentivise the drug industry, for example through changes to patents protecting new brands and for regulation around clinical trials to be eased.

Prof Farrar, who spent 18 years working in Vietnam where he saw firsthand resistance to TB drugs, said access to antibiotics needed to be regulated as they were available over the counter at low cost in many countries.

He said ‘No government can do this on its own because this is a truly global issue.

‘This is getting to the tipping point where you will start to see this in you and your families and we will start to see this not in infections many, many miles away but her in London’ he added.
