A retired police officer was killed and his current police officer wife critically injured when a drunk-driving teen crashed into their motorcycle during Mardi Gras festivities this weekend.Â 

Retired Houston Police Officer Dana Tweedie, 61, was riding with other officers to a Mardi Gras celebration in Galveston Saturday Evening with wife Linda, 52, on the back seat when Callie Inman rammed into them in her red Camaro.

The 18-year-old former Dayton high 
school cheerleader was pulling out of the Valero gas station parking lot
 around 7:40pm when she hit the law enforcement couple going west on 
Seawall Boulevard.

Behind bars: 18-year-old Callie Inman was arrested for intoxication manslaughter and assault after killing and injuring a police officer couple on Saturday

Collision site: The Tweedies were driving west on Seawall Boulevard when Inman pulled out of the Valero gas station and rammed into their bike

Police say Inman was drunk at the time of the accident and even tried to escape arrest by blending into a crowd after the crash.

Dana Tweedie, a 25-year-veteran of the HPD, died from his injuries while wife Linda, who had been with the HPD 30 years, was taken to the hospital and last reported in critical condition.

The Tweedies had one child together, a son who is in the military. He was able to get leave on Sunday to visit his mother in the hospital.

Inman was arrested and charged with intoxication manslaughter and intoxication assault.

Only son: The Tweedie's son Kyle, who is in the military, was able to get leave on Sunday to visit his mom in the hospital

Remembered: Kyle Tweedie changed his Facebook profile image to a picture of him and his dad following the fatal crash

She was booked at the Galveston County Jail where she is still being held on $150,000 bond.

The Houston Police Department is currently fundraising to help pay for Mr Tweedie's burial and Mrs Tweedie's medical expenses.

Houston Police Officers Union president Ray Hunt described Linda Tweedie as an officer with a 'great reputation' who never missed fundraisers for other officers hurt in the line of duty.

'It's very tragic when you lose one of your own,' Hunt told the Houston Chronicle. 'It's like losing a family member.'

'This is a tragic situation that need not occur,' added Galveston Police Department Chief Henry Porretto. 'An impaired driver took a great member of the Houston community. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Tweedie family and the Houston Police Department.'
