Kell Brook has called on Amir Khan to accept his 'Battle of Britain' challenge after defending the IBF welterweight world title in style in Sheffield on Saturday.

Just six months after he was stabbed with a machete in Tenerife, Brook had mandatory challenger Jo Jo Dan on the canvas four times during his return before the Romanian was pulled out of the fight by his corner after the fourth round.

Brook now has fellow Brit Khan in his sights and promoter Eddie Hearn confirmed on Saturday that he has Wembley Stadium booked for June 13.

Khan appears reluctant to accept this particular challenge, though that has not stopped Brook from piling on the pressure.

The 28-year-old told Sky Sports News: 'Amir Khan has just stepped up to welterweight. It's a massive fight in Britain. It will fill out Wembley. It's something I would really be up for and get excited for.

'I have got the title. To be honest with you, we are going round in circles with that fight. I am the champion. He's got nothing to offer.

'There's a belt on the line. I'm giving him an opportunity. There's going to be a lot of money there for him, probably the most he's earned in a fight.

'It's in Britain. It's a war of the roses. I don't know why he hasn't taken the fight. It baffles me.

'He knows he's delicate around the whiskers as I keep saying. It's just a matter of time before he's forced into that fight because of the public demand and we'll see him on the canvas once again.'

Brook also revealed on Sunday that he wants to take on the winner of the May 2 superfight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao in a unification bout.

He told TalkSport: 'The fact is Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao; they’re the ones with the belts along with me. There are only three men who hold them, so I’m looking at targeting the winner of Mayweather and Pacquiao to set up a big unification fight.

'I want to be involved with the very best fighters out there and they’re the names that really excite me and get me up in the morning. They’re the kind of fights that I want.

'You never know what’s going to happen in boxing. Something could happen with Mayweather and Pacquiao and I could slip in there – you never know.'
