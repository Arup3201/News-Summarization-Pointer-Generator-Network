A five-year-old boy has been left traumatised after he was lured behind a building at his school and attacked by five  classmates before being made to face them again  just an hour later.

Ewan Potter was kicked and punched in the playground of Living Faith Lutheran Primary School at Murrumba Downs in Brisbane's north two weeks ago. 

He was left with some 'cracking bruises' and clear psychological effects, but his father Anthony says the young boys responsible got away with just a slap on the wrist.

Mr Potter was told by the school the group of boys - aged five and six - organised for the on-duty teacher to be distracted so they could carry out the attack on February 26.

'Ewan told me he was tricked into playing with the boys. They lured him behind the building and when he tried to run away they chased him and caught him,' Mr Potter told Daily Mail Australia.

'They dragged him back and started kicking and punching.

'The bruises are still there on his knees. He had a couple on his arms and chest. Luckily he didn't have any broken bones or blood gushing out.' 

His parents were only notified of the incident several hours after it happened because the school tried to sort out the situation using a method known as 'restorative practice'.

'They made Ewan go back to face all five boys so they could see what the bullying had done to him - how traumatic is that?' he said.

'He went to sleep that night with a stick to protect himself. I sat on the floor of his bedroom.'

Four of the boys remained in the same class with Ewan the next day, while the little boy who admitted to being 'the boss of the group' was moved to another classroom. 

'It's gang violence. I can't believe six-year-olds can be pre-meditating attacks like this. One admitted to being the boss and getting four others involved,' Mr Potter said.

The parents of all five children were called in and given behavioural orders  to work on at home, while age-appropriate consequences were enforced at school.

Principal Jane Mueller said the school  had taken swift action and were 'saddened' by the bullying. 

'I fully understand the concerns of parents of any child impacted by such an incident, and by the same token, I'm also conscious of our responsibility to teach these very young students at the infancy of their school career what is right and wrong,' she told the Courier Mail.

Ms Mueller said  the boys involved were still being monitored in the playground and consequences were being implemented at home with the support of parents.

'No matter what these parents do at home to help them, these kids have got away with a slap on the wrist. If we keep letting them get away with violence, how is it going to stop,' Mr Potter said.

'For my own child's safety I have to rely on other parents to take a proactive approach.' 

Mr Potter said he was hesitant to take Ewan back to school the day after he was bullied but didn't want him to fear it altogether.

'I just sat him down and told him what they did was wrong. I still sit there asking if he's okay. He's been really quiet and shut down.

'I don't know how much it's going to affect him. I still can't believe it happened.'
