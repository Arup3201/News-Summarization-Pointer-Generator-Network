Memories: Cissy was said to have been 'devastated' when she heard of Bobby's condition as she was still traumatized by the death of her daughter, Whitney 

According to TMZ, suspicious injuries found on Bobbi when she was taken to hospital made them suspect foul play may have been involved. 

Jerod Brown wrote on Instagram on Thursday that 'doctors don't see any hope for change', but her father has slammed claims the family are preparing to say goodbye. 

Bobbi was found unconscious by her partner Nick Gordon and friend Max Lomas in her Roswell, Georgia home. 

Lomas discovered Bobbi Kristina after he went looking for her when a cable man knocked at the door, E! reported. When she did not respond, he went in and found her, his attorney said.

It was revealed on Friday that she could have been submerged for around 15 minutes before she was discovered.  

She was rushed to hospital and her family has remained tight-lipped about her condition, but on Thursday, her cousin took to Instagram to provide friends a heartbreaking update.

'Though it seems the odds are against her,' Jerod Brown wrote, 'though doctors don't see any hope for change, though we might want to play detective and find out how she got there, though it looks impossible for her to stand again STILL PRAY FOR BK.' 

Cissy was seen visiting the hospital on Thursday having flown in from her home in New Jersey.

Sources told Radar Online she is 'devastated' as she is still traumatized from her daughter Whitney's death.

By her side: The family have not responded directly to claims life support has been switched off, but have slammed claims they are preparing to say goodbye to the 21-year-old 

One person told the website: 'Cissy was traumatized losing Whitney in 2012 and the pain is still raw from that.

'Watching Krissy in the hospital and in the coma is almost more than she can handle. This is almost too much sadness for her to bear.' 

She was also the most outspoken against the film about her daughter, which premiered last month.

'Lifetime has chosen to go ahead with the movie about Whitney in spite of my family's objections,' the bereaved mother said in a statement to Entertainment Tonight in June.

'No one connected with this movie knew Whitney or anything about her relationship with Bobby.' 

On Thursday, DailyMail.com learned that Bobbi's life-support machine was switched off.

'The plug on Bobbi Kristina has been pulled,' a police source said.

It is possible for a patient to survive despite artificial assistance being withdrawn.

Bobby Brown did not respond directly to the claims but slammed reports saying that the family were preparing to say goodbye to his youngest daughter.

'This is false, just as is the vast majority of the other reporting that is currently taking place,' he said in a statement on Thursday. 

'If we issued a statement every time the media published a false report regarding this matter, that's all we would be doing 24 hours a day.'

The last official word on Bobbi's condition from the family came on Tuesday when they said in a statement that she was 'fighting for her life and is surrounded by immediate family'.

On Thursday, he briefly told Access Hollywood that his daughter was 'good'. He appeared tired and his eyes were red as if he had been crying, the program reported. 

If Bobbi passes away before she inherits the full amount of her mother's will, it will go to Cissy Houston and her sons, Michael and Gary, according to the will's terms.

'The odds are against her': Bobbi Kristina's cousin Jerod Brown wrote on his Instagram page on Thursday that 'doctors don't see any hope for change' in her condition as he called for prayers

Family: Cissy, pictured with her daughter in 1989, could stand to gain some of her granddaughter's inheritrance if she passes away 

Houston died in a bathtub from an 'accidental' drug overdose almost exactly three years ago, in tragically similar circumstances.

Authorities found a dozen prescription drug bottles in her Beverly Hills Hotel suite and listed heart disease and cocaine use as contributors, but concluded that she accidentally drowned.

Bobbi Kristina was found in eerily similar circumstances on Saturday morning.

Questions still remain over what part drugs - if any - played in Saturday's incident; police reportedly found narcotics in the home during a second search last weekend.
