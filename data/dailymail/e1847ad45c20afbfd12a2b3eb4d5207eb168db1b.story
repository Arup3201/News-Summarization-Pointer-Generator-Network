A struggling school plagued by unruly pupils has called in the Royal Marines to patrol classrooms and the playground to help curb disruptive behaviour.

Staff at South Shore Academy in Blackpool are hoping the military presence in the corridors will improve discipline and attendance.

Three former Marines and Navy personnel will take part in one-on-one sessions, teach physical activities and remove disruptive pupils from class.

The war heroes have swapped the battlefields of the Helmand province in Afghanistan for the school playground, as they prepare to wage war on bad behaviour.

The move is part of a £40,000 plan to improve pupil discipline at the academy.

A recent Ofsted report found baheviour at the school 'required improvement' and that pupils' achievement was 'inadequate'.

The school has enlisted the help of Commando Joe's, a company which recruits former military personnel to work with challenging children.

The three former servicemen and women will be at the academy for the next 39 weeks, keeping pupils in line.

Students said they respect the camouflage-wearing teams, who they claim are 'scary'.

Year Seven pupil Jake Heathwaite, 12, said: 'They're scary if you're badly behaved but people are better behaved in the classes they're in.

'If someone's bad in lessons then theyll take us out so the teacher can get on for the rest of the class. We respect them because they're here to help us, not just to teach us.'

Dave Aston, 51, was in the Royal Marines for 30 years, serving everywhere from Afghanistan, Iraq and Kosovo to Northern Ireland, and now works with Year 11 boys two days a week.

Michael Todd, 24, was a helicopter pilot in the Royal Navy for four years, working under the official secrets act, and now works with all Year Seven pupils twice a week.

And former army trainer Becky Turner works with Year 11 girls on Monday mornings.

The trio do not teach lessons but work alongside teachers and run out of class activities.

Mr Todd said: 'Some children think teachers are just there to hassle them, we can work with them from a different angle but they see we're here to work alongside the teachers.

'We're trying to instill in them some respect, for school and for other people, those things that children don't necessarily get these days.'

Vice principal Graham Gerrard said: 'The idea is to motivate students, we're just hoping they're someone else who can create that spark in young people to ensure they can succeed.

'They're working to improve health and wellbeing as well as attendance and punctuality.'

A previous Ofsted report for Palatine Sports College, the school before it converted to academy status in January, noted behaviour required improvement and achievement of pupils was inadequate.

Year 11 pupil Robert Markillie, 15, said: 'We look up to them because they've been in the military, they've got a different status. I'd say they're well worth the cost.'

Classmate Hamza Shah, also 15, added: 'We respect them. When they're sitting next to you in class you feel like you have to do your work, you know someone's looking out for you.'
