Hearing a fully grown lioness roar is a fearsome experience, but when a week-old cub makes the attempt, it's nothing short of adorable.

In a video released last week, a female white lion cub from Belgrade Zoo tests out her vocal cords with extremely cute results.

The cub, who was born just over a week ago, wanders around her wooden box, looking somewhat bad-tempered and lets out roar after roar to express her displeasure.

But instead evoking terror, the little lion's little squeaks inspire nothing but delight.

With her white coat and her tiny squeaking  sounds, the cub is reminiscent of a bleating lamb.

The tiny lion is yet to be named, but she is already making her presence known.

She was born to Masha, a lioness who came to Belgrade Zoo from South Africa's Kruger Park.

Weighing in at 2.8lb, the cub was displayed to the media for the first time last week.

The new-born is one of a rare subspecies of lion whose white coats are a mutation of the Kruger subspecies of lion found in South Africa.

According to the Global White Lion Protection Trust, white lions weren't seen by Westerners until 1938.

There are only a few of the creatures still in existence, mostly in captivity, but since 2004, three white lion prides have successfully been introduced to their endemic region in South Africa.

They are considered spiritual symbols by native people of the Kruger area.
