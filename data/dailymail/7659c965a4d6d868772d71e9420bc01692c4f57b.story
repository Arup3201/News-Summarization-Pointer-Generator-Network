A gaffe-prone crime tsar is under police investigation for allegedly driving without insurance, putting her under fresh pressure to resign.

Ann Barnes’s Mercedes collided with another car and then ploughed into a tree, and The Mail on Sunday can reveal she is now being investigated by the force she holds to account, Kent Police. 

If she is found guilty of the insurance charge, she could be fined £300 and hit with six penalty points on her licence.

Ann Barnes' insurance was allegedly expired when her soft-top Mercedes collided with another car and a tree

Mrs Barnes, 69, also faces a probe by the police watchdog for alleged misconduct in a public office, as she was on official business when the accident took place.

The independent Police and Crime Commissioner, who is paid £85,000 a year, was last night facing renewed calls to step down following a series of debacles that have damaged the reputation of Kent Police and the troubled policy of elected crime tsars.

Mrs Barnes’s latest troubles began on September 16 when her soft-top Mercedes crashed into another car and then a tree as she drove to a meeting in Dartford. She suffered only minor injuries and later tweeted: ‘Not feeling too bright today, but OK.’

Asked what had happened, she replied to one person: ‘Hit an unforgiving tree! Shaken, sore and bruised, but thankfully OK.’

After the accident, Mrs Barnes was given a ‘producer’ by local officers, which meant she had to report to a police station within seven days with both parts of her driving licence, her MoT certificate and valid insurance. This is common procedure after a road traffic accident. 

Sources allege that Mrs Barnes’s insurance had expired – making it a criminal offence for her to be driving.

‘She had to produce her documents and she didn’t have a valid insurance certificate,’ an insider said.

Kent Police alerted the local scrutiny board, and Mrs Barnes’s own office referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

Mrs Barnes has faced criticism of her £85,000-a-year role as Kent police commissioner, and was mocked for her van - called Ann Force 1 - which she drove around the county

Mrs Barnes also came under fire for hiring Paris Brown as her youth crime commissioner shortly after being elected for the job. Yhe 17-year-old stepped down after it emerged she had posted indecent remarks online

The latest fiasco comes amid growing calls for all 41 PCCs across England and Wales to be scrapped. Labour and the Lib Dems say they would abandon the experiment, which cost taxpayers £75million to set up.

Even Home Secretary Theresa May admits some PCCs ‘have been responsible for mistakes and errors of judgement’ and backs the idea of voters being given the power to recall any who are failing.

Kent Police said: ‘No one has been charged or cautioned in relation to the collision. Inquiries are ongoing.’

A spokesman for Mrs Barnes said: ‘We can confirm that the chair of the PCC was made aware of a referral from Kent Police following an investigation into a collision in Princes Road, Dartford. 

'The matter was passed to the monitoring officer at the office of the PCC for further consideration. The monitoring officer has subsequently referred the matter to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.’
