19 Kids & Counting star and devout Christian Jessa Duggar has revealed that she won't kiss her boyfriend until their wedding day.

In the eighth season of the show, due to premiere on April 1, the 21-year-old from Arkansas tells how she and her beau, Ben Seewald, stick to traditional religious dating rules.

They avoid physical contact completely, only hugging briefly to say hello or goodbye - a step up from when they first starting dating and just a quick 'side hug' was allowed.

Young love: Reality star and devout Christian, Jessa Duggar, says that she and her boyfriend, Ben Seewald, are only allowed to hug briefly to say hello or goodbye and kissing is forbidden until their wedding day

Michelle Duggar - who has 
guided her daughter through the throes of courtship - confirms in a press release
 for the upcoming installment of 19 Kids & Counting: 'They want to wait on the physical relationship until later.'

Jessa announced last fall that she had struck up a relationship with Ben, three years her junior, after the two met at church.

'We are so excited for Ben and Jessa,' Jim Bob, the Duggar family patriarch, told People magazine at the time.

'They are enjoying getting to know each other and are recommending sermons to one another.'

Ben is the owner of Affordable Windshield Repair in Hot Springs, Arkansas; and he also works at the Diamante Country Club.

Lost in prayer: The couple met at church and started dating shortly after

 are so excited for Ben and Jessa!' Jim Bob & Michelle Duggar's 
third daughter Jessa has officially entered a courtship with 18-year-old
 Ben Seewald

Several other young men attempted to woo Jessa before the congressman-turned-realtor, Jim Bob, approved of Ben.

'He's the first one she has shown interest in that has a spiritual focus and legitimate calling about ministry work,' the 48-year-old said.

'When a guy is pursuing your daughter, you want to check and see if there are any red flags and with Ben, there hasn't been'

'When a guy is pursuing your daughter, you want to check him out and see if there are any red flags and with Ben, there hasn't been. He is very sharp. It appears like a match made in heaven.'

The Duggars define courtship as a couple deciding whether marriage is appropriate while in a group setting with both of their families.

As devout fundamentalist Christians, they believe in waiting until the wedding before a couple can share even a chaste kiss.

Even when Jessa and Ben text back and forth, her parents are looped into the conversation.

Smile for the cameras! The Duggars first entered the spotlight in 2008 on TLC's show 17 and Counting - a series which followed the life of Michelle and Jim Bob and their then 17  - now 19 - children

Strong bond: Michelle and Jim Bob Duggar have been married 29 years

'It has been interesting to watch 
their interactions because they share very similar beliefs,' said the 
47-year-old matriarch, Michelle.

'It has been fun to watch them and both of our phones are going off back and forth, ping, ping, ping.'

In the new season of 19 Kids & Counting viewers will be able
 to watch the Duggar boys put Ben to the test, making sure that he’s 
ready to take care of their sister.

Later, the tables are turned when 
Jessa visits Ben’s hometown and gets hit with some serious questions 
during a double date with Ben’s parents. 

Plus, the whole family reflects
 on what it means that a Duggar daughter may soon be leaving the nest.

'All
 the girls are excited for Jessa!' Howard Books will publish a book 
penned by Jessa and her three sisters - Jinger, Jill, and Jana - next month

The tome will detail the Duggar daughters' televised journey, relationships, and thoughts about dating and marriage.

'All the girls are excited for Jessa,' said three-time grandfather Jim Bob. 'All of our family is involved in this relationship. It is an exciting time.'

The family is 
conservative Christian and has strong beliefs about issues such as 
contraception, home-schooling, and spending very little time on the 
internet or watching TV.

They
 are considered representative of the Quiverfull movement which 'teaches
 that children are God’s blessing and that husbands and wives should 
happily welcome every child they are given.'

Addressing
 their critics, Mr Duggar once said: 'People think we are overpopulating
 the world [but] we are following our convictions.'
