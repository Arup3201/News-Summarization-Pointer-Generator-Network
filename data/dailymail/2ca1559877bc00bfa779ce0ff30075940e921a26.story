The widow of murdered Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko has called on the Conservatives to return a £160,000 donation from the wife of one of Vladimir Putin’s former ministers.

Marina Litvinenko, whose husband died in London in 2006 after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium by two ex-KGB colleagues, criticised the Tories for taking the money in return for David Cameron and Boris Johnson playing a tennis match.

‘If David Cameron doesn’t want to appear like he is being bought, I think he should return this money,’ she said.

‘If it’s somebody Russian they just try to buy this loyalty. Cameron needs the support of British citizens and returning this money would send a good message.’

Mr Cameron has faced growing criticism after it emerged that Lubov Chernukhin, the wife of a former Russian deputy finance minister, won a bid for the ‘ultimate tennis match’ at a Conservative fundraising event.

Tory officials insist the money will not be handed back and say she is now a British citizen. They also insist her husband Vladimir fell out with Putin after being dismissed from his job in charge of a state-run bank.

Yesterday, however, party sources were quoted as saying the tennis match is ‘stuck in the locker room’ and may never take place.

There has been a new scrutiny over donations from those linked to Russian president Mr Putin after the EU threatened new sanctions in reaction to the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.

Labour leader Ed Miliband said yesterday the Tories have ‘questions to answer’ over the money they were accepting in donations from wealthy Russians.

Figures from the Electoral Commission suggest that Conservatives have taken more than £161,000 from people with links to the Kremlin, and Labour has calculated they have received almost £1million from Russians in general.

‘David Cameron does have questions to answer on the money that he’s taking from Russian oligarchs, on the bidding for a tennis match, all of that stuff,’ Mr Miliband told the BBC’s Andrew Marr programme.

‘Frankly, he can’t stand up one minute and say that “this is the biggest issue and we’re going to take the right action”. He’s got to really look very, very carefully at who he is getting money from.’

Mrs Litvinenko, speaking about broader donations from wealthy oligarchs, said: ‘You never know who is behind these Russian businessmen. You need to be very careful whose money it is. You must be absolutely sure because many Russians are not free from the Russian government.’

A Tory spokesman said there had been no change on plans for the tennis match, adding: ‘All donations are transparent, permissible and done under the rules set out by the Electoral Commission.’

Mr Cameron does not believe Russia should
 be humiliated by being stripped of the right to host the 2018 World Cup
 – but warned he is ‘not surprised’ critics are beginning to raise the 
issue.

Downing Street said the Prime Minister was not supporting an ‘immediate’ boycott after Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said it was ‘unthinkable’ for the tournament to be played there if Mr Putin continues with his ‘belligerent behaviour’.

Labour’s shadow foreign secretary, Douglas Alexander, also stopped short of calling for the World Cup to be moved, but urged governing body FIFA to draw up contingency plans for it to be held elsewhere.

FIFA, however, has ruled out a boycott, insisting the tournament is a ‘force for good’ and should not be influenced by global politics.

But in the wake of the downing of flight MH17, Mr Clegg said stripping Russia of major sporting events would be a ‘very potent political and symbolic sanction’.

‘Vladimir Putin himself has to understand that he can’t have his cake and eat it,’ Mr Clegg told the Sunday Times.

‘He can’t constantly push the patience of the international community beyond breaking point, destabilise a neighbouring country, protect these armed separatists in the east of Ukraine and still have the privilege and honour of receiving  all the accolades in 2018 for being the host nation of the World Cup.’
