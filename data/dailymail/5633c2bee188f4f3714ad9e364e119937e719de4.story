Javier Hernández has been urged to join former Manchester United team-mate Nemanja Vidic at Inter Milan.

New United boss Louis van Gaal has made it clear Hernández isn’t in his plans, so much so that the Dutchman didn't even want to take the Mexican on tour to the US, although he subsequently had to back-pedal and include the forward in the party that travelled to Los Angeles.

The Mexican would be a good signing for the Milan giants according to Vidic, who joined Inter in the summer after eight seasons at Old Trafford.

'These things are up to clubs,' Vidic told reporters.

'Obviously, Chicharito will be a good signing for every club and we'd be glad to have him.

'Now we have to focus on this group to get the Europa League qualification. It's not the Champions League but it's a very nice competition with a lot of good European teams.'

Diego Simeone is keen on taking Hernandez to Atletico Madrid

However, Inter look to have a major rival for the 260-year-old’s signature in Atletico Madrid.

Reports in Spain suggest Diego Simeone has urged Atlético director of football José Luis Pérez Caminero to further bolster his squad's attacking options by bringing in a strike partner for Mario Mandzukic, and it is understood that Hernandez is the chosen one.
