American author Stephen King has joined twitter, but was immediately stuck for anything to say

The Shining author Stephen King has joined Twitter and attracted 30,000 followers in his first three minutes.

However the American writer at first appeared to be stuck for anything to say, messaging: 'On Twitter at last, and can't think of a thing to say. Some writer I turned out to be.'

However the new account, which was advertised on his facebook profile now has more than 170,000 followers with regular updates.

While King is no stranger to technology, speaking about his enthusiasm for innovations such as e-books and electronic readers, he has until now resisted joining Twitter.

On Friday King introduced himself to the online world with the simple message 'My first tweet. No longer a virgin. Be gentle!'

He immediately struck up a rapport with other authors, including Margaret Atwood, writing: 'I have no idea what I'm doing here. The thought of all those eyeballs has stricken me dumb.'

King's assistant has confirmed the account is real, and said that his publisher had encouraged him to join.

Fans have so far learned that the Portland-born wordsmith is a fan of TV shows The Returned and Homeland, as well as Stieg Larsson's Millennium trilogy which includes The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.

The 66-year-old writer is using the name @StephenKing, and apparently wanted to use @StephenKingAuthor but found the name was too long.

King has spoken about his enthusiasm for technology such as e-books before but until now has avoided Twitter

During his literary career King has written over 50 books, including science fiction, horror, fantasy and non-fiction, and has had several novels turned into films, including Green Mile which starred Tom Hanks.

He has sold more than 350million copies worldwide and has received Bram Stoker Awards, World Fantasy Awards, British Fantasy Society Awards the O. Henry Award.
