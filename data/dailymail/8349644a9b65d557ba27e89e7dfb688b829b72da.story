The frosty relationship between the late Senator Ted Kennedy's first wife and his widow has apparently improved over time.

A new report in the National Enquirer claims that the famed Democrat's widow Vicki has tried comforting her predecessor Joan over the past few years after the surprise death of Joan's eldest daughter.

Ted, the younger brother of former President John F Kennedy, had three children with Joan, and their eldest Kara died from an unexpected heart attack in 2011, two years after her father succumbed to a brain tumor.

Easing the tensions: Senator Ted Kennedy's first wife Joan (left, front) and second wife Vicki (right, back) reportedly did not get along during his life but Vicki has supposedly tried to become closer (the two women pictured at Kennedy's sister Eunice's funeral two weeks before his death in 2009)

Final year: Senator Ted Kennedy (pictured in August 2008 at the Democratic National Convention) was diagnosed with a brain tumor three months earlier

Family: He and his first wife Joan (pictured in 1991, nearly a decade after their divorce) had three children together- Kara (left), Patrick (second from left) and Ted Jr (center)

'Their animosity toward each other was evident at his funeral rites, but in the years since, Vicki has reached out to Joan,' an unidentified friend told The National Enquirer.

'Vicki's been concerned that Joan might fall off the wagon again and has repeatedly checked on her.'

Joan, 77, has had a history of alcohol abuse and both been arrested for drunk driving on a number of occasions and sent to court-mandated rehabilitation programs.

She was married to Kennedy for 24 years before they divorced in 1982.

Kennedy married Vicki- nearly 20 years his junior- in 1992, and while the longtime Massachusetts senator was alive, the two women did not reportedly get along.

Coming together: Vicki is seen in the front row during her husband's funeral in August 2009, with her stepdaughter Kara standing directly behind her and Kara's brother then-Congressman Patrick Kennedy behind

Keeping to their corners: There were reports that Vicki and Joan (pictured with her son Patrick at the Boston service following Ted's death) were kept away from each other at the Senator's funeral

Kara's sudden heart attack following her 
daily work out in Washington D.C. on September 16, 2011, came as a blow 
to the family that was still recovering from the loss of their last 
patriarch.

Time and joint grief for the children that Vicki treated as her own once she married Kennedy have apparently helped soothe the earlier tensions between the two women.

'Vicki will no doubt see Joan this summer and together they'll mourn Ted on the fifth anniversary of his passing,' the anonymous friend told The Enquirer.Â 

'You have to think Teddy would be happy that they're friends and he'd be looking down, smiling.'

His family also has some good news to celebrate, as another one of their own has decided to enter the family business.

After
 Joan and Ted's youngest son Patrick stepped down from Congress shortly 
after his father's death, their second child Ted Jr just recently 
announced that he hope to enter politics on the state-wide level.

Unexpected: Kara Kennedy, seen left in April 2011 with her two children by her side, suffered a fatal heart attack five months after this photo was taken while at a gym

Watching out for Joan: A friend has revealed that Vicki has reached out to her husband's first wife (seen back center following her daughter's casket) after Kara's death because there were fears that Joan would start drinking again

The 52-year-old former healthcare lawyer is running for a seat in the Connecticut state senate.

'I've always thought my brother could be a really powerful leader, I'm not just talking elected-office sense, but leadership sense,' Patrick said about his brother before Ted Jr made his official campaign announcement.

'He's just got such a tremendous personal story. I've always thought he'd be a very compelling political figure because he's integrated work with public policy with his own personal experience.'
