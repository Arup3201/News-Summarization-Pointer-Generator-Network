A frail grandmother was viciously attacked with her own walking stick by a drug-crazed thug who burst into her home, a court was told yesterday.

Angela Mayger, 73, was left with shocking bruises to her head, eyes and arms after 20-year-old traveller Gary Smith confronted her.

Smith punched her in the face, pushed her and then slammed her head against a door in an attack branded 'cowardly and despicable' by his own barrister.

After she refused to hand over the keys to her new car he snatched her walking stick from her and used it to beat her around the head.

Mrs Mayger was so terrified that she could barely move.

Smith, a career criminal who was high on alcohol and cannabis, refused to stop despite pleas from his victim and repeatedly screamed: 'Give me the key to your car.'

He was yesterday jailed for five years as the court was told that Mrs Mayger now lives in daily fear that he will return to her home once released from prison.

Recorder Julian Goose QC told Smith: 'You violently and viciously attacked an elderly woman at night.

'You put her to the ground as you attacked her. In the victim impact report Mrs Mayger said she was shocked by the level of violence used against her.

'She says that every day she lives with the fear that once you are released you will come back and visit her again.

Violence: Mrs Mayger was punched in the face, by Smith who then slammed her head against a door in an attack

'A woman of 73 now lives in fear of violence because of you.'

In
 a blistering attack on the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) the judge 
also said Smith should have been charged with robbery, not burglary, 
because of the use of force.

If
 so, Smith, who has 20 previous convictions for affray, stealing cars, 
criminal damage, theft and two assaults, would have been facing a jail 
sentence of up to 15 years.

The
 court was told how Mrs Mayger was at home in Kilham, East Yorkshire, 
making supper when the doorbell rang at 9pm on February 9.

Mrs Mayger, who lives alone, thought it was her son and went to open the door only to be confronted by Smith who pushed his way into the pensioner's hallway.

Mrs Mayger tried to fend him off with her walking stick but Smith was too strong and snatched it from her before unleashing the terrifying assault.

'I thought I was safe in my own home,' she said after the attack. 'All my doors and windows have locks and I have a burglar alarm. I just answered the door and he burst in. I was very frightened.

'He punched me on the right hand side of my forehead with a clenched fist.

'He banged my head against the door. He hit me straight away with the walking stick, very hard to the theft hand side of my forehead.

'It sounds silly, but my legs were quivering.'

After a brief tussle with his victim Smith grabbed the pensioner's car keys and drove off with fellow traveller Richard Miley, 23.

The men, who live on a traveller site just yards from Mrs Mayger's home, sped off towards Bridlington but crashed minutes later.

They later handed themselves into the police after a wave of public revulsion.

Both men pleaded guilty to aggravated vehicle taking at Hull Crown Court whilst Smith admitted a further offence of burglary.

Steven Garth, for Smith, told the court: 'The defendant carried out this despicable and cowardly attack on this old lady.

'It was only when he sobered up did he realise what he had done.

'He was extremely drunk and to compound matters he was smoking cannabis. He remembers little - he was almost senseless.'

Smith was disqualified from driving for two years. Miley, who has a previous conviction for burglary and vehicle taking, was jailed for three months but walked free from court because of the time he has already spent in custody.
