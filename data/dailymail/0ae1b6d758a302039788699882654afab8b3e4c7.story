It brings a new meaning to the phrase ‘heavy police presence’.

This substantial officer was at the centre of a debate about physical fitness in the police force yesterday amid claims that he is Britain’s fattest bobby.

But colleagues were quick to defend Sergeant Andy Sharp, saying he is not even the largest officer in his force.

Whatever the truth, he might struggle
to meet controversial new physical tests designed to make sure those on
the thin blue line are fighting fit.

Frontline representatives are locked in discussions over what form the annual fitness assessments should take.

The move follows fears that some 
officers in demanding jobs are held back by being overweight and out of 
shape. Sgt Sharp, a long-serving Met officer who specialises in 
organising high-profile events, was photographed marshalling crowds on 
Sunday.

He was seen with road cycling star Mark  Cavendish at the Help 
the Heroes charity bike ride from Blackheath to Central London.

He was also out and about last month as thousands of demonstrators marched through Whitehall to protest at NHS cuts.

John Tully, of the Met Police 
Federation, said Sgt Sharp spends most of his time on ‘desk duty’ but 
comes out during the events he supervises.

He said: ‘Everyone should be fit for 
purpose. There is a minimum level of fitness for everyone who completes 
officer safety training.

‘Presumably he has been able to do that. Regular fitness tests will soon be introduced and we wholeheartedly support that.’

Police have been warned they could 
face pay cuts and ultimately dismissal if they do not meet the standards
set by new fitness tests.

A major review by former rail 
regulator Tom Winsor called for running tests and assault course-style 
assessments to ensure officers can chase criminals.

A survey found 52 per cent of male 
officers and staff in the Met were overweight, 22 per cent were obese 
and one per cent were morbidly obese.

One senior officer told the review 
some officers attending basic safety training were ‘so unfit they cannot
complete the warm-up exercises’. Mr Winsor said fitness equipment 
should be installed in stations or officers given access to gyms.

If they fail, they could be sent on weight loss courses or given health and diet advice.

Rick Nelson, a Met officer and Federation representative who is helping design new fitness tests, said changes are being made.

But he added: ‘In many cases, just 
because officers are heavy it doesn’t mean they are unfit. And a very 
fit officer is not necessarily brilliant at the job.’

1.    Running (known as the Multi-stage shuttle run test or Bleep Test)2.    A test of strength (Dynamic Strength Test or Push-Pull)You should wear gym shoes and gym kit when taking the test.(1) The multi-stage shuttle run test (Bleep Test)This is done first. You will run back and forth continuously between 2 lines 15 metres apart in time to an electronic bleep. The speed will increase with each new level until you reach the pass mark. The level required is 4 shuttles at level 5 (5.4). You will run 44 shuttles to reach this level.You are likely to pass if you can run 1.5 miles in 12 minutes or run on a treadmill for 8 mph for 12 minutes at zero gradient. (2) Dynamic Strength Test (Push-Pull)This test is carried out on a Concept 2 DYNO machine. After 3 warm up pushes, you will then have to push as hard as you can 5 times. This is repeated with pulling instead of pushing. The mean result of your five maximum efforts for each push or pull will be recorded. The minimum level is 34 kg (push) and 35kg (pull).   You are likely to pass if you can achieve five strict repetitions with 40 kg weight on a seated chest press or bench press machine and on a seated rowing machine. PRE Scale – As you run rate the intensity on a scale of 6 to 20. Number 6 being very, very light and 20 being exhausting. Aim for an intensity of number 14 or 15, which should feel like a HARD run. If you feel you have exceeded number 15, then slow down as you could be running too fast.

Recruits have to pass fitness tests when they join but no requirements for non-specialist officers to complete tests once they are in the job
