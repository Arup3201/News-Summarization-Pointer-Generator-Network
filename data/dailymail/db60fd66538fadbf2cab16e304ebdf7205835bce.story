Pet lovers have raised £4,000 to rebuild the face of a tomcat affectionately nicknamed 'the Purr-minator' after he was left with horrific injuries when a cabinet fell on him.

Five-month-old Thomas was left unable to eat and in need of a major operation after his jaw was fused shut in the accident at his owner's home on Merseyside. 

A vet who treated the injured animal compared the cat to the sci-fi cyborg played by Arnold Schwarzenegger after its face had to be stitched.

Emergency effort: Pet lovers have raised £4,000 to rebuild the face of a tomcat Thomas, pictured, affectionately nicknamed 'the Purr-minator' after he was left with horrific injuries when a cabinet fell on him

Help: Thomas is being fed through a tube as he recovers from the incident that saw his jaws fused shut

Wellwishers have stepped in to help when the cat's plight and the animal was referred to one of Britain's top vets.

Currently the fund is £1,000 short of the £5,000 target to fix his jaw.

Thomas' face will need to be reconstructed after the two hour surgery as the 'super-vet' in Surrey may have to take out part of his cheek bone.

Administrative assistant Elaine Clarke, 50, from Warrington, Cheshire,  sacrificed her 50th birthday celebrations to lead the campaign to save the cat on behalf of a friend, Thomas' owner.

She said: 'We have been told by the vets to bulk him up and bring him back.

'We need to feed him up every three hours, get him exercising and get him some muscles. Thomas will need to be bulked up like a mini Arnie for him to survive the surgery.'

Elaine first became aware of Thomas when his owner posted some pictures of him on a Facebook site asking for advice. 

She said: 'She posted a picture of him after a cupboard had fallen on him and a few weeks later a video of him trying to eat and you could see he was struggling to eat the meat and could only drink the milk. So everyone commented 'go to the vets,' which she did do.'

Funding: Thomas' owners are desperately trying to raise money to fund the crucial treatment 

Happier times: Thomas,  before his head was partially crushed by a falling cabinet 

Thomas was then taken for an X-ray and it was thought he had a broken jaw which only allowed him to open his jaw 2mm and Elaine offered to take the cat in.

'After various treatments of steroids and antibiotics there was no improvement in his condition,' she said. 'The vet then suggested taking biopsy's from the top of his head and either side of his jaw. The results came back and the left side of the jaw and top of the head were clear, regrettably there is tissue and muscle damage to the right side of the jaw.'

Thomas then had a nasal feeding tube placed to allow him to eat but having pulled it out, a vet refused to replace it fearing it was unethical and that he should be put to sleep. Elaine and Thomas' owner were referred to a veterinary specialists in Surrey.

Elaine, an administrative assistant, said: 'After a consultation they told me his jaw was fused but right were the joint is. The jaw had fused right where it meets the skull. They said, 'we want you to bring him back a miniature Arnie, really feed him up and we will weight him in a few weeks to see if we can operate.'

When Elaine first took Thomas in he weighed just 1.1kg but has since put on half a kilo.

She said: 'He is tiny. He is about 5-months-old but the size of a 12-week-old kitten. We have to body build him up with loads of food which being fed through a stomach tube. We need to exercise him too.'

'I have to get up at 6.30am every morning and feed him every half an hour. My mission is to get him strong enough for surgery.'

Recovery: Thomas, left and right with a friend, has been lucky to survive but needs surgery to improve his chances of survival

'I missed my 50th and everything because I had to feed him. I was also supposed to go on holiday to celebrate it but we needed to be here for Thomas.. It's worth it though. I was a lost cause and doctors told me I was in a worse state that they had seen for a long time. But I made it though and Thomas is the same. If there is a chance, you have to fight, whether it is for your cat, your dog or you family member.'

'He is so adorable. I will be sad when he has to go back. He is part of the family now.'

The Go Fund Me page reads: 'He is such a loving, strong and very brave little cat and deserves a chance to live. We were looking to raise up to £2000 but now need to raise £5000 and any donations big or small would be gratefully received and very welcome.

'Thomas has now been referred to the best vet in the country to see if there is any way that they can help him. We know that the treatment does not come cheap hence the reason we have now increased the fund requirements. Please help us to give Thomas a fighting chance to live a normal life.'
