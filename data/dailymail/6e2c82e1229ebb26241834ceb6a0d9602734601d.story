The mother of murdered toddler James Bulger faces a bleak Christmas after internet hackers stole her and her husband's festive savings from their bank account.

Denise Fergus and her husband Stuart said their joint account was hacked by thieves who deducted £900 through a bogus PayPal transaction.

Now the couple fear their children's Christmas Day will be ruined as they won't have enough money to buy them presents.

Sickened: Denise Fergus and her husband Stuart have had £900 stolen from their joint account by hackers

Murdered: Denise Fergus's son James Bulger was killed by Jon Venables and Robert Thompson in 1993

The 42-year-old said: 'This has been really sickening for both of us. That money was our Christmas box.

'It's an awful feeling, looking at 
an empty bank account and wondering how it happened, what it means, and 
wondering how you are going to have any Christmas.

'You feel powerless and violated, knowing that someone has been into your bank account and cleared it out.'

Electrician Mr Fergus said he 
knew about £900 was missing when he looked at his NatWest account and it
was showing the money had been transferred to PayPal.

Speaking at their home in Kirkby, Mr 
Fergus, 36, said: 'I told NatWest that my bank account had been hacked, 
but they said there was nothing they could do. It was up to PayPal.

'I
phoned PayPal and they logged my call but said they could not suspend 
the transfer because they had not proof it was fraudulent.

'They say I have to make a complaint and it will take between seven to ten days to resolve the matter.

'I
am hoping that because I have spotted it quickly and reported it that 
they will be able to return the money to us without delay - it's savings 
we had put to one side for the children's Christmas presents.

'What
seems crazy is that the the bank can't stop the payment on my behalf 
because the money has not yet gone through the clearing system.

'I went to my local branch of NatWest as soon as it opened to report it and they said it was showing as being still in process.

'I have not used PayPal this year. I
can only think that someone must have hacked into the account by 
getting my email address off Facebook.'

Mr Fergus explained that he and his 
wife had been shocked by the incident and he had closed his Facebook 
account as a precaution.

Mrs Fergus whose two-year-old son James was killed 
by schoolboys Jon Venables and Robert Thompson in 1993, is mother to 
Michael, 17, Thomas, 13, and Leon, 12.

She added: 'I would warn everyone to 
look at their Facebook account and make sure an email address connected 
with their PayPal is not public for all to see.

'It's awful to think that simply by 
getting hold of an email address some evil racketeer can clear you out 
at the touch of a button.

'We
have reported it to the police and they have given us a crime number, 
but they say it is up to PayPal and the bank to try to sort it out in 
the first place.

'I'm just 
hoping and praying that the bank and PayPal can get the money back to 
us. Without it, we are looking at a really grim Christmas.'

NatWest are investigating.

A spokesman for Facebook said: 'Personal
details on an account are shared only with friends but it would take 
more than just an email address to make a fraudulent transaction.'
