Watchdog Ofgem has criticised energy companies for their poor dealing of customer complaints

Ofgem has written to energy companies demanding they take action on poor handling of customer complaints.

The regulator's chief executive has sent letters to the 'big six' and smaller and independent suppliers about the 'industry-wide failure' to handle complaints to an acceptable standard.

It follows research by Ofgem that found more than half of those who had complained - 57 per cent of domestic customers and 52 per cent of small businesses - were not satisfied with how their supplier handled the problem.

Furthermore, in almost half of cases where the supplier considered the case resolved, the customer did not.

Ofgem said satisfaction with Npower and Scottish Power had fallen particularly markedly, from 36 per cent to 21 per cent and from 44 per cent to 20 per cent respectively, with only SSE managing to maintain levels of satisfaction found two years ago.

Earlier this year Ofgem opened an investigation into Npower's 'prolonged customer service failings', the first under its new standards of conduct which state that suppliers must treat consumers fairly.

In today's letter, Ofgem warned companies to improve the speed of resolving complaints, communicate better with customers during the process and be more proactive in finding a solution.

The letter read: 'The results are unacceptable. I am therefore drawing attention publicly to these findings to leave you in no doubt about the need to act quickly to improve matters.

'I expect you to provide a public response to the issues raised in this letter.'

The regulator said many customers were now responding to suppliers' poor service by switching, with almost one in two customers having either already switched or planning to do so as a result of their complaints experience.

Ofgem chief executive Dermot Nolan said: 'These satisfaction scores are frankly awful.

Npower and Scottish Power have seen satisfaction with their customer service fall markedly

'Almost all energy suppliers need to improve their complaints handling as a matter of urgency. There are real business benefits to good complaints handling schemes, and it shouldn't need a regulator to tell companies about the importance of this.

'Suppliers must now tell their customers what steps they will be taking to put things right. We are already formally investigating Npower about complaints handling and other customer service issues, and this should send a strong signal to all suppliers that, where necessary, we will take action.'

Ofgem said it was planning to bring forward the next survey of complainants to see whether the necessary improvements had happened and decide if more regulatory action was needed.

Which? executive director Richard Lloyd said: 'It shouldn't need involvement from Ofgem for energy companies to get the basics right. We found energy companies have hit rock bottom, with woeful service and dreadful complaints handling.

'This situation has been going on for far too long and it's little wonder that consumer trust is so low. Suppliers need to respond with immediate improvements, not wait for the results of the Competition and Market Authority's investigation.'

Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: 'Energy prices are up by a third since 2010 and people are now paying well over a thousand pounds a year to heat and light their homes.

'Energy is a basic essential for every household so firms need to do everything they can do get their service right and if something does go wrong, do their utmost to fix it straight away.

'Trust in the industry will be never be restored if suppliers can't get a grip on complaints handling. Ofgem should investigate firms where their handling of complaints, and the cause of them, could be breaking industry rules.'

Energy tariff prices are in a constant merry-go-round with suppliers battling to pinch customers - you - from each other.

Shrewd

 consumers can take advantage of this by doing exactly that - reviewing 
deals every six months to a year to ensure they are on THE cheapest 
deal. Even moving every other year will save you significant amounts.

If
 you are one of the millions of people who have NEVER switched (i.e. 
stuck with your original supplier), then you will DEFINITELY save a big 
chunk of cash, possibly as much as £300 a year.

Remember, suppliers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so.

Don't forget, prices
 are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you 
will depend where you live.

You only need to be interested in the tariff
 that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison 
to find the best price.
