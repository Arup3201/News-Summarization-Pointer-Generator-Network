Arsenal are close to signing Atletico Madrid holding midfielder Mario Suarez as Arsene Wenger begins his January spending spree, according to reports in Spain.

The 27-year-old played 22 games last season as Atletico won La Liga and made it to the Champions League final, but has fallen out of favour this season.

With the likes of Gabi, Tiago, Raul Garcia and Saul Niguez ahead of him in the pecking order under Diego Simeone, Suarez is looking to move on.

According to respected Spanish journalist Eduardo Inda, a former editor of Madrid-based paper Marca, Suarez 'will almost certainly go in the winter transfer window'. 

And Arsenal, who are short of options in the holding role, are his most likely destination as Wenger attempts to secure Champions League football for a 17th straight year.

The Gunners boss revealed on Tuesday that he is looking for a midfielder to help cover for injuries in the squad, with Wenger having to recall Francis Coquelin from a loan spell at Charlton recently to play alongside Mathieu Flamini.

'If you look at the number of games some players played and the injuries we have with Wilshere, Ramsey and Arteta, we are a bit short at the moment in midfield,' Wenger said.

Suarez, capped twice for Spain, has been at Atletico since he was 12 years old, with the exception of a two-year spell at Mallorca, who sold him back to his first club in 2010.
