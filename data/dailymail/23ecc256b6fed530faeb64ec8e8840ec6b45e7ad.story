Police in Connecticut are hunting for three missing children who are believed to be with their mother.

Police in Vernon issued a statewide alert for the 
three children - nine-year-old Ryan Lewis and Dylan and Brandan Lewis, 
who are both seven.

The boys are believed to be with their mother Jackie Morris, 32, who is reportedly driving a red 2004 Volkswagen Jetta with the Connecticut license plate 876YGJ.

Officials say Morris has ties to Connecticut, Massachusetts and Maine.

Authorities haven't released details on how the children went missing.

Morris is described as 5-foot-2 and 120 pounds with brown hair, blue eyes and a tattoo of a crucifix on her neck.

A lawyer for the children’s father, Jason Lewis, said the boys live with their father and that their mother has visitation rights.

The children last spoke to their father on Sunday and told him they were on a highway and saw 'toll booths'.

She reportedly did not return the children to their father after the most recent visit and the boys also missed school Monday and today.

Detective James Grady said today he was worried the children might be in danger. He said police have had previous contact with Morris and there is 'cause for concern'.

Sources told WFSB that Morris has previously had mental health problems including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and attempted suicide.

Officers urged anyone who sees the mother and boys not to approach them and contact the state police at 860-685-8190.
