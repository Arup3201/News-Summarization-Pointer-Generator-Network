A beloved pet dog has been killed after being bitten by a snake in a country park.

Ted, an 11-year-old bearded collie, was put down after suffering kidney failure caused by the adder bite on his front left leg while on a walk with his owner Pauline O’Brien, 67.

The vet who treated Ted said it was the first time in her career of 26 years that she had seen a pet killed by a snake bite.

Adders are the only venomous snakes found in the wild in Britain and will normally only attack if they feel threatened.

It is thought the adder may have bitten Ted because it was afraid it was about to be trodden on by the dog.

Pauline, a divorced mum-of-one and a mobile hairdresser from Bolton, Greater Manchester, is now warning other dog owners to beware when using parks in the area.

She had had Ted since he was a puppy.

'Like losing part of the family': Ted's owner Pauline O'Brien, 67, had him since he was a puppy and has been left distraught by his death

The incident happened at Smithills 
Country Park in Bolton.

Ted was bitten near the historic Smithills 
Coaching House and it was not until the day after, when he started 
limping badly, that he was taken to the vets and the adder bite was 
spotted under his long hair.

Ted
suffered from arthritis so his difficulty walking was not initially 
thought to be a cause for concern. But when the swollen leg was shaved 
the bite was discovered.

He was bitten four weeks ago but his condition deteriorated, eventually suffering kidney failure, and he died on Saturday when he was put down by vets.

She said: 'We were just walking around and he was off his lead and he was going in the long grass, I think that must be where it happened.

'It is very long grass and he is a bit clumsy, I think he had probably stood on the adder.

'When we got home I noticed that he was limping, I thought it was his arthritis but his leg had really swollen up.

'I took him to the vets and she initially thought that he had broken his leg but after the X-ray she called and said that it wasn’t broken.

'When she shaved all his hair she saw the two horizontal bite marks and she thought he had been bitten by an adder.

'Obviously what has happened is the poison had caused him to have kidney failure. At first the vet gave him penicillin, antibiotics and anti inflammatory but he was being sick after the medications.

'It was very serious and the vet had to give him injections because he wasn’t eating and then he was put on a drip.

'It was heartbreaking to see him like that, he couldn’t even get up the stairs he was that frail. I just looked at him and I thought he can’t go on any longer.

Irreplaceable: The family had to put Ted to sleep and they felt like they were 'losing part of the family'

'It was devastating to make the decision to put him to sleep. It was like losing part of the family.

'Ted will be irreplaceable. It was love at first sight when I saw him.

'I’m
still shocked that there are snakes, you don’t normally hear of them in
the UK but apparently because of the warm weather at this time of the 
year there has been an influx of them.

Since this has happened I have actually heard of other dogs being bitten. It’s tragic.'

Unlucky: According to NHS Direct most snake bites suffered in the UK are not often serious and rarely deadly

Vet Ruth Harrison, from Vets4Pets, said the suspected adder bite was the first she had come across in 26 years of working in Bolton and Chorley.

She added: 'We rarely see snake bites. We tend to see adders on the moors or in other wild areas. They try to avoid people. Ted’s bite looked very much like a snake bite.

'Adders are the only indigenous snakes in the UK that are venomous. The bite caused a nasty reaction, it damaged all the tissues in his leg. Dogs are affected in different ways by the poison.'
