Arsenal teenage prodigy Gedion Zelalem has boosted the future of American soccer by gaining U.S. citizenship.

The 17-year-old, who has featured once in the Arsenal first-team this season, was born in Ethiopia but spent a majority of his childhood in the States before moving to London to pursue his career with the Gunners.

USA Soccer president Sunil Gulati announced the news on Twitter with this post: 'Gedion Zelalem is now a U.S. citizen. At his request we have started the FIFA process which would allow him to be eligible for the #USMNT.'

Zelalem played one FA Cup match for the Gunners last season and played in the 4-1 Champions League win at Galatasaray earlier this month as Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger holds the midfielder in high regard for the future.

'He is a player with a good eye and good technique and is very agile. He has the ambition to find the ball on the field. So he's the kind of player who could be of use to the United States,' Wenger told Sports Illustrated back in July .

'He's in some ways the type of player the US was missing in the World Cup.'

However the 17-year-old could still choose to represent Germany, who he played for at youth level, and needs FIFA to approve his application but his intentions seem to lie with the USA.
