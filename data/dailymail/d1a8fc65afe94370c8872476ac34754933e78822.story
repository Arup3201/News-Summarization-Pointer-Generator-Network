Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutcliffe has been recorded telling family he will one day be able to 'pop to the shops' on day release, it emerged today.

The serial killer, who was jailed for murdering 13 women, was also taped at the high security hospital Broadmoor defending predatory paedophile Jimmy Savile.

Sutcliffe, now 66, was recorded speaking on weekly telephone calls to his younger brother Carl Sutcliffe by a source who leaked the tapes to The Sun.

It is claimed that Frank Bruno (right) had no idea who he was shaking hands with when this picture was taken. He has since said that he was duped into this meeting by Savile (centre)

He claimed he had been cleared for a move to a medium - security unit and said the only person who is standing in his way was Broadmoor's clinical director, Dr Kevin Murray.

Psychopath Sutcliffe said: 'Dr Murray turned down several medium secure units willing to accept me.'

Patients in high secure 
hospitals, such as Broadmoor are classed as a grave and immediate danger
to the public who require a significant period of treatment.

Patients in medium security units, of 
which there are around 30 around the country, still present a 
significant danger, but will remain in treatment between two and five years.

Face of a killer: Sutcliffe has claimed he is 'cured' and will one day be able to 'pop to the shops' in taped conversations. He is pictured right on his wedding day in 1974

According to the recordings Sutcliffe, who was jailed for life in 1981 after admitting killing 13 women and attempting to murder seven more, has been deemed a 'low risk' prisoner as long as he takes his medication.

During the calls, which the Sun reports were made every Tuesday and lasted 15 minutes, he also defends Jimmy Savile, as police investigate 300 cases of alleged abuse by the former BBC star across three decades.Â 

He claimed the victims were talking 'rubbish' and insisted his old friend was innocent.

Sutcliffe, whose reign of terror spanned between 1975 and 1980 in one of the most notorious serial killer cases in British history, was also taped boasting about how many visitors and penpals, some as young as 21, he had.

He even claimed he had commissioned one letter writer, a talented artist called Fiona, to do a 'picture of him'.

Victim: Police search the grounds of a property called Claremont where the body of Marguerite Walls, the 12th victim of Peter Sutcliffe the Yorkshire Ripper was found

Memories: Sutcliffe is pictured here at the wheel of a lorry. The former driver said he enjoyed watching documentaries about Eddie Stobart, as it 'brought back memories'

The murderer bemoaned his regular visits from 'shrinks' and said how he was now disgusted by food, apart from toast and honey.

The former trucker, who claimed he was on a divine mission to rid the streets of prostitutes, is now a Jehovah's Witness and whinged to his brother during the calls that he could not find a copy of the Watchtower, a magazine produced by the religious group.

He also said he could not read very well as he only has one remaining good eye after losing the other in a vicious attack, but recently enjoyed watching a documentary about Eddie Stobart as it 'brought a few memories back.'

Sutcliffe, who once reached 20 stone while in the secure unit, said he was in good health and said he was a believer in going to bed early, and waking up early.

In the chats with his brother he also discussed his opinions on general topics such as marriage, which he believes is dying out as an institution, university fees, which he has deemed to expensive when there is no guarantee of a job at the end, and celebrations such as New Year's Eve, 'just an ordinary day'.
