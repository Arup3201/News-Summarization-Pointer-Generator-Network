One week before a close election, superstorm Sandy has confounded
the presidential race, halted early voting in many areas and led some to ponder
whether the election might even be postponed.

It could take days to restore electricity to more than 8 million
homes and businesses that lost power when the storm pummeled the East Coast
-leading experts to question whether the election can be put back from November
6th.

While the answer is of course yes in theory, the probability of
the choice between Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama being postponed is
unlikely despite the devastating effect superstorm Sandy had on 60 million
people across the north-east, or one-sixth of the population.

But as the storm left its trail of destruction behind, even some
of those intimately involved in the election seemed in the dark about what
options are available to cope with the storm.

Asked Monday whether President Barack Obama had the power to
reschedule the election, White House press secretary Jay Carney said he wasn't
sure.

However, constitutionally, the President doesn't set the date for
the election, Congress does.

Congress could act within the next week to change the date, but
that would be tough because lawmakers are on recess and back home in their
districts campaigning for re-election.

Plus, it's likely that would mean changing the date for the entire
country, not just those affected by the storm.

What's more, Congress only selects the date for federal elections,
so changing the date would wreak havoc for state and local elections also
scheduled for Nov. 6.

'For those states that don't already have an election emergency
process in place, any departure from the established election process could
easily give rise to court challenges about the legitimacy of the election,'
said Steven Huefner, professor at Ohio State's Moritz College of Law to ABC
News.

'Even states with an emergency plan might find themselves facing
litigation over specific ways in which they've implemented their emergency
plan.'

Some have asked if it is likely for the election to go ahead but
to allow New Jersey and New York to vote at a different time afterwards.

That is possible, but the legal issues get tricky. States, by and
large, are in charge of their own elections.

Each state has its own laws dealing with what to do if an
emergency jeopardizes voting and who can make the call.

Federal law says that if a state fails to conduct an election for
federal races on the day Congress chooses, the state legislature can pick a
later date.

Nevertheless, experts told ABC News that even minor contingency
arrangements, like keeping polls open longer in some precincts or moving
polling locations, will probably lead to legal challenges and more provisional
voting, which can delay election results.

But state and federal laws don't always jive perfectly. Virginia
Governor Bob McDonnell has said his state's laws don't grant him authority to
reschedule the presidential election.

Despite no presidential election ever being postponed, some are
pointing to past precedents where voting has been delayed.

New York City was holding its mayoral primary when terrorists struck
on Sept. 11, 2001, and the city rescheduled the election.

After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Louisiana's governor postponed
municipal elections in New Orleans after elections officials said polling
places wouldn't be ready.

However, what is most likley is a compromise for those affected by
the havoc caused by the storm.

Voting hours could be extended at various locations and in places
where electronic voting machines are in use, paper ballots could be used
instead.

Some areas also might choose to move polling locations if existing
ones are damaged, inaccessible or won't have power on Election Day.

But even amending election day to accommodate the affected would
create problems in themselves.

If poll hours are extended, under a 2002 law passed by Congress in
response to the disputed 2000 presidential election, any voters who show up
outside of regular hours must use provisional ballots, which are counted later
and could be challenged.

Crucial swing states such as Ohio have felt the impact of Sandy and could make all the difference in the election next week

Sandy's impact was felt in some of the most competitive states in
the presidential race, including Virginia and Ohio.

The more provisional ballots that are cast, the greater the
chances are that the winner won't be known until days or even weeks after the
election.

There's another issue if poll hours are extended in some areas -
such as counties with the worst storm damage - and not in others.

That could prompt lawsuits under the Constitution's Equal
Protection Clause, said Edward Foley, an election law expert at The Ohio State
University.

Relocating polling places is also risky because it could drive
down turnout, said Neil Malhotra, a political economist at Stanford
University's Graduate School of Business.

'If you disrupt their routine and the
polling place they've always been going to, even if you don't move it very far,
they vote less,' he said.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency's administrator, Craig
Fugate, said Monday he anticipated the storm's impact could linger into next
week and affect the election.

He said FEMA would look at what support it could
provide to states before the election.

'This will be led by the states,' he
said.
