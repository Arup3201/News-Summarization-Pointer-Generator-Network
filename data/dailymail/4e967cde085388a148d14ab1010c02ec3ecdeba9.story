While the festive season is the time for giving, with donations of food, toys and money flowing in to charities, one widower's gift has topped them all.

One Massachusetts woman donated her diamond engagement ring and wedding band, along with a note valuing them at $1,850, saying she hoped the money would pay for children's toys.

And now a buyer has snapped the pair up for $21,000, adding that she wants to return the jewellery to its rightful owner.

A widow donated her diamond engagement ring to the Salvation Army along with note valuing the pair at $1,850 and explaining that the gift was in memory of her generous late husband

The heartwarming story began on Monday last week as volunteers at the Salvation Army in Massachusetts emptied their red donation kettles.

Inside one, workers found the two rings in a zip-lock bag, along with a note explaining that the donor's late husband enjoyed giving at Christmas time, and she was donating them in his memory.

The note read: 'I've dropped my wedding ring in your Red Kettle knowing that the money from its sale will buy toys for needy children.

'To honor his memory, I donate this ring. I'm hoping there's someone out there who made lots of money this year and will buy the ring for ten times its worth.

'After all, there's no price on love or the sentimental value of this ring. But money will help the kids. May everyone have a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and Happy New Year!'

And on Friday the Salvation Army received an offer of $21,000 from another widow, who did not want to be identified.

The benefactor, a former bell-ringer with the charity, said: 'I want to be involved in this because it's about the spirit of Christmas, the spirit of giving. 

The rings have now been bought for $21,000 by another widower, who did not want to be named, who said her aim is to return the jewellery to its rightful owner

'My wish is that the rings can be returned to this woman who gave them up in memory of her husband for the sake of children at Christmas.'

However this may prove a difficult ambition to fulfill, as nobody - including the Salvation Army - knows who the mystery donor was. 

Her offer was the largest of nine received by the charity in just a week, all of which were for more than the rings' valuation price.

Major David B. Davis, head of the Massachusetts Salvation Army, said: 'We're so moved and incredibly grateful to the generous individual who made such a loving and kind donation. 

'This heartwarming gift boosts all of our staff, bell-ringers, and volunteers who are working tirelessly during the Red Kettle Campaign to encourage donations that help those in need.' 

The Salvation Army has set a statewide Red Kettle campaign goal of $3.36 million this year to support individuals and families throughout the Commonwealth.

The Red Kettle tradition began in 1891 when Salvation Army Captain Joseph McFee wanted to help feed needy citizens in San Francisco. 

McFee remembered the ferry landings in Liverpool England, where people would sit with small kettles that travelers would toss spare change into to help the less fortunate. 

Placing his own kettle on Market Street in Oakland California, McFee was able to help needy individuals on Christmas.
