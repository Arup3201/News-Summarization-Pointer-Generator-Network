The financial report still has to be approved by the club's board of directors, which will hold a general assembly on September 21.

This summer, Real have spent 122.5million euros in the transfer market having brought James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos and Keylor Navas on permanent deals while Javier Hernandez joined the Spanish outfit on a season-long loan from Manchester United.

However, that figure is almost balanced out by the 114million euros received for Angel di Maria, Xabi Alonso, Alvaro Morata, Casemiro and Diego Lopez.
