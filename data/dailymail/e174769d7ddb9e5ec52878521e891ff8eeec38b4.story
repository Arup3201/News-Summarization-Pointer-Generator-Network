A leading German politician has taken a significant step towards implementing an 'anti-stress law' - banning employers from contacting workers outside office hours.

Employment minister, Andrea Nahles, has commissioned a report to asses the viability of new legislation in the wake of rising stress levels and work-related mental health issues in Germany.

The report will examine the effect of people being in constant contact with their office - a trend blamed largely on the popularity of smartphones.

It is already illegal under German law for companies to ask employees to do any work while on holiday, including answering emails. 

But Ms Nahles suggests the law needs to go further as high working demands mean people are finding it impossible to switch off when they are at home. 

She told the Rheinische Post newspaper: 'There is an undeniable relationship between having to be constantly available and the rise in mental illness.' 

Recent surveys have confirmed that Germans tend to take their work home with them leading to high levels of of stress.

Health insurer Techniker Krankenkasse found in a report last year that stress levels had increased in the last 12 months for 53 per cent of the people their surveyed, The Local reports.

And in August last year, a television programme called 'Stressed Germany' also investigated the country's growing problem.

The programme revealed that the number of sick days taken as a result of mental illnesses had risen by 80 per cent in the last 15 years. 

Germany’s coalition government promised that they would improve people's 'work-life balance' in their coalition agreement last year.
