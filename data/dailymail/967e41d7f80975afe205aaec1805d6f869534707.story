A burglar stabbed to death during a raid may have been trying to target a bingo jackpot winner but broke into the wrong house.

Masked intruder John Bennell, 27, died from the wounds to the chest he received after he and three others entered the house in Salford, Greater Manchester.

Homeowner Peter Flanagan, 59, was arrested on suspicion of murder but has been freed pending further inquiries. 

Wrong house? Peter Flanagan's home in Salford where raider John Bennell was stabbed. Police believe he may have meant to burgle a bingo winner's house

The incident occurred just days after David Cameron promised stronger support for people protecting their property from burglars.

Detectives are puzzled over why a gang would target the engineer’s modest £120,000 home, which he shared with son Neil, 27, who was also questioned after Wednesday night’s raid.

One line of inquiry is that the gang had set their sights on a jackpot winner they believed lived in the area - but burst into the wrong address.

Mr Bennell, who was left to die nearby after being dragged from the house and then abandoned by accomplices, was on bail for burglary following a theft in Tamworth, Staffordshire.

It is understood that in that raid the home of a professional gambler was targeted.

The Salford bingo winner, who asked not to be named, said: "The police have spoken to me. They have said not to worry but I'm still a bit scared.

“People have suggested it might have been my address but I can hardly believe it."  

Police sources confirmed they were now investigating if the competition winner's house was the intended target of the raid.  

The dead man's estranged father, Garry Bennell, from Denton, has spoken out to apologise for his son's actions.

The golf club captain said: ‘I know that things can get out of hand but you’re entitled to protect your property.’

Asked what he would have done if an intruder had broken into his home, Mr Bennell said: ‘I would hope to have the guts to protect my property.

‘Obviously he’s dead, we wouldn’t want to kill anybody. He’s my son.’

Asked how his wife, Diane, 56, felt about the situation, Mr Bennell said: ‘She’s gutted. At the end of the day, it’s her son. Whatever happened in the past between us, he was still our child.’

Mr Flanagan, a grandfather and father-of-three, remains a murder suspect after being released on police bail until July 25.

Neil Flanagan’s 21-year-old girlfriend, who was staying the night, is believed to have dialled 999 to report the break-in just before midnight on Wednesday.

Family members have refused to speak about the case.  

A 23-year-old man, from Hyde, was being held today on suspicion of aggravated burglary  after last night handing himself at Ashton-under-Lyne police station, where he was arrested.

The man remains in police custody where he is being interviewed by detectives, police said.

A 30-year-old man suspected of being one of the gang was released without charge on Saturday.
