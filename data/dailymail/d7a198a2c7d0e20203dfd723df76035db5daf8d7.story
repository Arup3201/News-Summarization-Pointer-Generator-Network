Sacked: David Lowe, who has 32 years' service with the BBC, lost his job for playing The Sun Has Got His Hat On

The sacking of a veteran BBC DJ for accidentally playing a song featuring the N-word has been condemned as ‘unfair’ by David Cameron and Boris Johnson.

The senior Tories leapt to the defence of David Lowe for his treatment after broadcasting a 1930s recording of The Sun Has Got His Hat On.

Prime Minister Mr Cameron said the case ‘looked a bit odd’ while Mr Johnson said the Corporation’s treatment of the broadcaster was ‘utterly disgraceful’.

Critics have compared the decision to oust Mr Lowe to the treatment of Top Gear host Jeremy Clarkson using the N-word in a leaked clip from the show.

Mr Lowe lost his job after he played a recording of the song by Ambrose & His Orchestra on his Sunday night show on Radio Devon. The version includes the line: ‘He’s been tanning n****** out in Timbuktu, now he’s coming to do the same to you.’

It is understood that only one person complained and that Mr Lowe, who was unaware the word was in the lyrics, planned to apologise to listeners on his next programme.

However he was prevented from doing so by bosses who asked him to ‘fall on his sword’.

Today Mr Cameron joined the chorus of disapproval aimed at the the way Mr Lowe had been treated. He told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: ‘The word in question is awful and unacceptable and people shouldn't use it.

‘I don't run the BBC so I have to be careful but it does seem in this case where if he really didn't know what was on the record, it does seem slightly unfair.

‘And as I understand it the BBC have talked about taking him back on again... Well as I say, I don't know all the facts of the case but from reading the papers like everyone else, it looked a bit odd,’ the Prime Minister said.

Meanwhile London Mayor Mr Johnson said Britain was living in a ‘Boko Haram world’, in reference to the terrorist network that kidnapped over 200 schoolgirls in Nigeria.

Boko Haram forbids Muslims to take part in any political or social activity connected to Western society and has killed more than 1,500 people this year.

In his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson wrote: ‘In our own modest way, we live in a Boko Haram world, where it all depends on the swirling rage of the internet mob, and where terrified bureaucrats and politicians are borne along on a torrent of confected outrage.

‘There is no consistency in the outlook of the Nigerian maniacs: they use weapons produced by the very capitalist system they claim to deplore, for instance.

‘There is certainly no logic at the BBC. They should restore Mr Lowe to his job - if he will take it - and the entire BBC board should go down to Devon to apologise in person, and at their own expense.’

He added: ‘Their treatment of this man is utterly disgraceful.’

The BBC has offered him his job back, but Mr Lowe said he declined because his departure caused him so much stress and flared up a medical condition he suffers from.

A BBC spokeswoman said the corporation admitted the discussion about Mr Lowe's future ‘could have been handled better’ and said the ‘door remained open’ should he want to return.
