Convicted: Albrecht Muth, 49, has been found guilty of strangling his socialite wife, 91, in 2011

An eccentric German man who pretended to be an Iraqi army general was today found guilty of choking his 91-year-old socialite wife to death.

A jury deliberated for half a day before finding Albrecht Muth, 49, guilty of first-degree murder in the August 2011 beating and strangulation death of his wife, Viola Drath. The German journalist was found dead in their row home in Washington D.C.

Muth did not attend the trial in D.C. 
Superior Court after 
doctors said his intermittent bouts of self-imposed starvation made him too weak to 
appear. Instead, he participated by video link but did not testify.

Muth, who prosecutors say was motivated by inheritance money, faces up to life in prison when he is sentenced in March.

He had claimed that his elderly wife died from a fall in the bathroom, but authorities said her injuries were not consistent with someone who had fallen.

The killing captivated Washington 
because of Drath's longtime connections to the city's diplomatic and 
social circuits, and due to revelations in the couple's unconventional 
relationship.

Jurors heard about how he masqueraded as a brigadier general in the Iraqi army, strolling around his neighborhood in a uniform he purchased. He also displayed a store-bought military certificate in his home even though he didn't actually have a military background.

Muth's lawyers argued that no physical evidence connected him to the killing and said the case against their client was circumstantial. Muth denied guilt, blaming her death on an Iranian hit job.

Victim: German journalist and socialite Viola Drath was found beaten and strangled in the couple's D.C. home. Prosecutors said that her much-younger husband had sought inheritance money

Prosecutors cited a pattern of verbal and physical abuse toward his wife, including a conviction for assaulting her in 1992.

hey said Muth, who lived on a $2,000 monthly allowance from Drath that had recently been reduced by $200, was motivated by money and made a bogus claim to a portion of her estate.

Drath was a playwright and columnist who wrote often on German affairs for publications including The Washington Times and Handelsblatt, a German newspaper.

In 1990, following the death of her first husband, she married Muth, who was nearly a half-century younger. The couple lived together in a row home in Georgetown, where they routinely organized dinner parties for dignitaries and other guests.

Muth also became romantically entangled for several years with a man who eventually sought a restraining order against him in 2004.

On the morning of August 12, 2011, following a night of heavy drinking, Muth called police to report finding his wife dead inside a third-floor bathroom of their home.

Crime scene: The investigation began after Muth reported finding Drath's body in the bathroom of their home in Georgetown, Washington. He claimed she had fallen but police later ruled it a homicide

He said she had fallen, and investigators initially treated the death as one of natural causes. But the medical examiner's office concluded within days that it was a homicide.

At trial, prosecutors presented graphic 
crime scene photographs of Drath sprawled dead on the bathroom floor 
with what one expert described as a large, bloody gash on her neck and 
another wound on the back of her neck.

Detectives settled on Muth as the suspect after finding no signs of forced entry. They determined only Muth and his wife were home at the time of her death. They also said he presented Drath's daughter with a phony amendment to her will, even though Drath specifically left him out of it.

A forensic investigator said Muth appeared anxious and 
fidgety but otherwise emotionless after she came to the home to take 
photographs and inspect the body.

She said he seemed especially curious 
to know the cause of death and whether any trauma was found that could 
explain it.

After killing Drath, prosecutors said Muth searched the Internet for information about extradition arrangements with Mexico, flights to Iceland and crossing the Canadian border.

One of Drath's daughters, Connie Drath Dwyer, testified that Muth had pressured her mother for money and insisted he be able to keep furniture upon her death.
