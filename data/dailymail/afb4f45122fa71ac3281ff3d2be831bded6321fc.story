Olympic champion Laura Trott won Great Britain's fourth gold of the Track World Cup in London with victory in the women's omnium on Sunday.

Trott, who won gold in track cycling's equivalent of the heptathlon at London 2012, claimed her second gold of the three-day event at the Lee Valley VeloPark, formerly the Olympic Velodrome.

She was a key figure in Friday's win in the women's team pursuit, while Britain also won the corresponding men's event and Owain Doull and Mark Christian on Saturday won the Madison.

Great Britain's Laura Trott won the women's omnium event on Sunday at the Track Cycling World Cup

Trott had 186 points after five of the six disciplines, 14 points more than nearest rival Jolien d'Hoore of Belgium, with Kirsten Wild of Holland third on 164.

The final, decisive discipline in a revised omnium format is the points race which once proved Trott's Achilles heel.

However, her confidence boosted by winning gold at the Commonwealth Games in July, the 22-year-old produced a tactical masterclass in a race which features sprints every 10 laps.

Trott was limpet-like on the wheel of D'Hoore, who was wearing the all-white Track World Cup series leader's jersey, for much of the 100-lap (25-kilometres) race.

The pair also monitored Wild and Australia's Isabella King, who began the final discipline in fourth.

D'Hoore tried to shake Trott off her wheel and won the seventh of 10 sprints as Trott failed to score, reducing the deficit to eight points, but with time running out.

Wild and D'Hoore attacked after failing to score in the eighth sprint, but Trott marked the move and then, roared on by a partisan crowd, won the penultimate sprint and five points to ensure the gold would be hers.

Trott finished on 193 points, with D'Hoore second on 181 and Wild third on 167.

Tougher tests are to come for Trott as she eyes reclaiming the world title in Paris in February.

The United States' Sarah Hammer, who has beaten Trott to gold at the two Track World Championships since London 2012, was absent, but the field was nevertheless strong.
