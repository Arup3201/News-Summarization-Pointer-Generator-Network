The will of legendary director Mike Nichols was filed in Manhattan Surrogate’s Court Wednesday.

Nichols, who passed away last month at the age of 83 from cardiac arrest, left his $20million fortune to his wife, newscaster Diane Sawyer, and three children, Max, Daisy and Jenny Nichols.

Beyond that, only a few specific gifts were detailed.

In charge: Nichols' wife Diane Sawyer was also named the executor of his will

According to Page Six, 'a J.F. Herring painting will go to his son Max Nichols and his wife will get all his tangible property including furnishings, automobiles and clothing.'

The will was signed last May, and Nichols appointed Sawyer as the executor. 

Sawyer will also likely continue to live at their penthouse on New York City's tony Fifth Avenue and keep their vacation home on Martha's Vineyard.

Nichols had a long and illustrious career in show business, getting his start as a comedy duo with Elaine May before going on to become one of the greatest directors of all time.

He is one of just a few people to have collected a Grammy, Emmy, Tony and Oscar, for works including the film The Graduate, the play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and the television special Angels in America.

At the time of his death he was preparing to direct Meryl Streep as Maria Callas in a film version of Master Class for HBO. Streep, a longtime friend, had worked with Nichols on Silkwood, Heartburn, Angels in America and Postcards From the Edge.

She was just one of the many actors who came to remember him following his passing, a sign of the special bond he shared with those he worked with over the years. 

Said Streep of Nichols, 'An inspiration and joy to know, a director who cried when he laughed, a friend without whom, well, we can't imagine our world, an indelible irreplaceable man.'
