A Florida mother is furious at a police dispatcher who would not send officers to help when her baby son was trapped inside her sweltering car.

Shana Dees was running errands on Saturday with her 10-month-old son Jack. It was about noon when they left a CVS pharmacy in New Tampa and and Dees moved Jack from the shopping cart to his car seat.

The cart began to move away because of the parking lot's uneven ground. Dees ran over to secure the cart — but turned back to a frightening scene.

'Those three seconds, when I was moving the cart, he hit the lock button,' Dees told WFTS.

The car wasn't running and the heat was soaring, hitting a maximum of 96 degrees. Also locked inside: Dees' cell phone and purse.

'I was just sitting there, watching him get hotter and turn redder — and he was soaked with sweat, Dees told WFTS.

She begged a stranger to let her call 911 with his cell phone.

'My infant son is locked in the car in the parking lot,' Dees told the dispatcher, WFTS reported.

'It is so hot outside. I'm really concerned, like I don't think I have time to call AAA before he would suffer heat exhaustion. Can somebody come out and open the door? I don't even know if that is something you guys do.'

The dispatcher responded: 'They won't be able to try to gain access [to the] car unless the child is in some kind of distress and, well, by that point they may just smash your windows.'

The call went silent.

Some eight minutes later, an off-duty officer saw Dees' desperation and called 911 himself.

'Where are they at?' the second dispatcher said. 'We will be out there for her.'

Before the officers arrived, another CVS customer grabbed a wrench inside the store and broke one of the car's windows — rescuing baby Jack and handing him over to his mother.

The Tampa Police Department has launched an investigation into the incident and the dispatcher, who 'absolutely make a mistake,' will likely be disciplined, spokeswoman Laura McElroy told WFTS.

'The dispatcher should've kept the mother on the line, should've found out where she was and then immediately dispatched both a police officer and fire rescue,' McElroy told the station.

Dees is thankful to the people who helped her get Jack out of the car.

'I would like to say thank you to them, to the man who let me use his phone to the officer that was able to get the police out there,' she told WFTS.

'Those were the first responders.'
