In the age of Facebook, most people can't resist taking a quick peak at their significant other's old pictures.

Normally though, that's enough to satisfy the curiosity.

Not so for one love struck boyfriend from Zhengzhou, in China's Henan province.

Identified only as Wan, the man has used photo-editing software Photoshop to superimpose himself into his girlfriend's childhood snaps - even choreographing poses to make himself fit into the pictures - and then posted them on Chinese social network Weibo to mark the couple's fourth anniversary.

He captioned them with the, slightly unnerving, message: 'I want to send my love letter to little you, but without a time machine, the only thing I can do is come into your dream to meet you'.

Could Wan's, as of yet unnamed, girlfriend expect an actual present to mark four years together? Not quite.

He wrote: 'I am sorry I don’t have a surprise for you, because I believe staying with you in the past four years is the biggest surprise.'

It is not known how the girlfriend reacted to the photos but they have divided opinions on the internet.

They have nearly 3,300 'likes' on Weibo, with many Chinese woman commenting how lucky the girl is to have such a romantic partner. However, other corners of the internet have been less enthusiastic.

Website Kokatu writing that 'A few photos almost border on pedophilia'. However, it should be pointed out that Wan's girlfriend is an adult.

Wan is known for somewhat over-dramatic opinions on the topic of love.

The wedding photographer often posts his snaps from peoples' ceremonies onto his Weibo profile, saying he doesn't want to miss a moment of people declaring their devotion to one another.

He once wrote on the site: 'I always tell my friends that the average lifetime for each person is 631,152 hours, and only 8 hours belongs to your wedding. Every wedding is unique in the world, and don’t miss the most memorable time.'

Wan didn't get any other presents for his girlfriend to mark their anniversary. He wrote: 'I am sorry I don¿t have a surprise for you, because I believe staying with you in the past four years is the biggest surprise'

Wan is from Zhengzhou, in central China's Henan province

Wan is not the first person to have their overly-romantic gesture poo-pooed by the internet.

When one 30-year-old New Yorker who, perhaps sensibly, has remained anonymous broke up with his girlfriend, he decided not to take it lying down.

So, at the beginning of last year, ten months after the split he launched a viral campaign, plastering posters all over the city emblazoned with the Nabakov quote 'It was love at first sight, at last sight, at ever ever sight' and even set up a website to help him in his quest. The quote, it turns out, is what he wrote on the woman's noticeboard after their final row.

He told a journalist at the time 'It is both an apology and a gesture to show her how much she actually means to me. I wrote the Nabokov quote on a chalkboard in her kitchen when we broke up. She's a writer and a reader and a lover of books, and this is an homage to her just as much as it is to the city I love most.'

However, another New York based journo wrote at the time: 'I had lots of thoughts! None of them were good! If a guy I had been seeing—and who messed up to a point that we broke up—suddenly took a private in-joke, or something like that, and plastered it all over the city, I'd feel thoroughly creeped out.'

Did he win her back? Unknown.
