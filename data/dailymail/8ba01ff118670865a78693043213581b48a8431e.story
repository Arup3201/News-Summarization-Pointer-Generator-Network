Napoleon the Great by by Andrew Roberts (Allen Lane, £30)

As there are already ‘many tens of thousands’ of books on Napoleon, and 33,000 extant letters and memoranda by him to consult in the Paris archives, Andrew Roberts will have to concede that the trajectory of his subject’s life and career, from Corsican upbringing to meeting his Waterloo at, er, Waterloo, is pretty well known.

Never before, however, has the scope and sweep been encapsulated so cogently in a single volume — even if it is a veritably Napoleonic volume of 1,000 pages, needing its own lectern.

Roberts has a superb eye for detail and useless facts. Napoleon Brandy, for example, is ill-named, as the Emperor never drank spirits. On the other hand, he took 800,000 pints of red wine with him to Egypt. Though Napoleon is credited with inventing the Legion d’Honneur, not many people know he set up the French Fire Brigade — the sapeurs-pompiers — or that he introduced street lighting in Malta.

Napoleon Brandy is ill-named, as the Emperor never drank spirits, on the other hand, he took 800,000 pints of red wine with him to Egypt

At the height of his power, Napoleon owned 39 palaces, some he never once visited. He was considered a monstrous figure in Britain — Boney as a bogey-man — yet Keats had a snuffbox with his portrait on it, Byron built a replica of his coach, and Lord Melbourne, the Prime Minister, wrote odes about him. Napoleon’s cure for piles was to apply leeches to his bottom. He was clearly a brave man.

‘I am the Revolution!’ Napoleon had exclaimed, and Roberts’s book backs up the boast. After his first few military victories, ‘I no longer regarded myself as a simple general,’ the character whom his troops affectionately called ‘the little corporal’ stated, ‘but as a man called upon to decide the fate of peoples.’

Napoleon was a veritable force of destiny — his megalomania was a foretaste of Hitler’s. Roberts, however, is at pains to make us appreciate Napoleon’s more humane achievements. He abolished the Inquisition and anti-Semitic regulations; he got rid of feudal practices and restraints on trade imposed by guilds, for example.

Insisting on ‘equality before the law’ in civil and criminal actions, Napoleon drew up legislation to protect citizens from arbitrary arrest. He protected property rights and codified inheritance decrees.

He gave better pay, conditions and pensions to soldiers. He instituted an educational system based on merit, not the privileges of birth.

All well and good — but for Napoleon, warfare was his preferred element, not a legislative chamber or committee room. He was never more down in the dumps than when he told Josephine: ‘My enemies are defeated, thrashed, in full rout.’

He didn’t much like Paris, a place ‘he had come to equate with corruption, disloyalty, heartache, secret malice and the potential for deep embarrassment’. How much more wholesome, manly, psychologically cleaner and fresher, by contrast, was a battlefield, with its displays of sheer courage and strategic ingenuity.

As a military cadet, where he’d excelled in maths and ballistics, Napoleon learned the arts of musketry, drills and horsemanship. He early in life formed ‘a strong belief’ in the virtues of brute force.

‘One cannot remain three minutes without gunpowder,’ was his philosophy, and his tutors thought him ‘blunt in manners, bold, enterprising and even ferocious’.

His first major action was at Toulon, where by ‘hectoring, bluster, requisitioning and political string-pulling’ he pounded the British fleet with cannon and mortars. Napoleon was a brigadier-general by the age of 24. He went on to fight more than 60 pitched battles, Marengo, Austerlitz, Jena, Borodino among them, and blow me down with a feather if Andrew Roberts doesn’t give an account of every single one, with maps, diagrams and in prose of much wit and total clarity.

So what if 18,000 men lost their lives in a campaign? Napoleon could rely on 50,000 fresh conscripts each year. He understood ‘the psychology of the average soldier’ — their need for songs, mottoes, medals, ‘small things that helped breed devotion’ and ensured the esprit de corps.

Much of the army’s time was spent fighting and re-fighting the Austrians, Prussians and Russians. Napoleon was an expert at playing allies off against each other, drawing up treaties that would then be breached and give him further excuses for war. Continuous conflict ensured there was a steady stream of pictures, statues and furniture from conquered cities making its way to Paris — loot for the Louvre.

Napoleon invaded Egypt to annexe the Ottoman Empire and ‘damage British trade in the region’.

For Napoleon, warfare was his preferred element, not a legislative chamber or committee room

He went to Spain to steal their ships, with which he’d planned to invade England — as with Hitler, a long-gestated and unfulfilled dream.

‘Good and upstanding people must be persuaded by gentle means,’ he murmured. ‘The rabble must be moved by terror.’ As dictators throughout history always realise, terror tactics work best. ‘Bloodletting is among the ingredients of political medicine,’ he believed. He used grapeshot on civilians and ordered massacres and village burnings. It was Napoleon’s policy to execute influential inhabitants, ‘at least one of whom must be a lawyer’.

Well, most of us will be with him there. At one town he took in the Middle East, even he was a little taken aback, however, at ‘the sound of shots, shrieking of women and fathers, piles of bodies, a daughter being raped on the cadaver of her mother, the smell of blood, the groans of the wounded’.

Yet how else really, he reasoned, could you ‘secure tranquillity’? Poetic justice of a kind came about in Jaffa. The French caught the plague from the locals. Soldiers were ‘covered with foam and the disgusting evacuations of abscessed buboes’.

At Borodino, 60,000 cannonballs were fired. There were 43,000 immediate casualties and 140,000 further deaths from wounds and disease, statistics that would remain a record until World War I

The march on Moscow and the subsequent retreat in sub-zero temperatures is another horrific episode, ‘reminiscent of Hieronymus Bosch’s depiction of Hades’, to which Roberts gives the full Tolstoyan treatment.

At Borodino, 60,000 cannonballs were fired. There were 43,000 immediate casualties and 140,000 further deaths from wounds and disease, statistics that would remain a record until World War I.

To put this in perspective, Roberts says it was like a Jumbo jet crashing with no survivors every five minutes for ten hours solid into an area six miles square.

A quarter of a million horses were taken on the Russian adventure, 10,000 expiring in the very first week from a combination of dehydration and a diet of wet grass. Napoleon himself went through five mounts a week, exhausting them ‘in quick succession’ as he ‘bowled unstoppably along a narrow valley gorge’. No wonder he had piles.

It was clear to anyone that Napoleon was driven by an ambition ‘full of zeal and fire’ and that one day he’d run the whole show in France if not Europe and the whole world

It was clear to anyone that Napoleon was driven by an ambition ‘full of zeal and fire’ and that one day he’d run the whole show in France if not Europe and the whole world. Having been elected First Consul in 1799, he soon became First Consul for Life and then Emperor.

His costume at his coronation included a gold laurel-wreath that evoked Ancient Rome.

Like the guillotined Louis XVI, he took up residence in the Tuileries and went in for flunkeys, grandeur and elaborate display. His wife Josephine’s dress bills were bigger than Marie Antoinette’s.

Napoleon was not such a tactical genius with his lady friends. His first paramour was the 16-year-old Desirée, daughter of ‘a dead royalist textile and soap millionaire’. Her rejection of him ‘contributed to his deep cynicism about women and even about love itself’.

Josephine, or the Vicomtesse Marie-Joseph-Rose Tascher de la Pagerie for short, had blackened stubs for teeth, the result of chewing raw sugar in Martinique as a child.

Her detractors called her ‘a cajoling courtesan’, and Napoleon thought her ‘frivolous, capricious and giddy’, so he married her in 1796.

It was not the great romance of legend. Napoleon didn’t seem to mind that she took lovers, one immediately after their marriage.

He was seldom at their home in Paris, preferring to invade Russia than the bedchamber.

After the defeat by Wellington at Waterloo, in 1815, Napoleon wanted to settle in the U.S., where he’d no doubt have started up again.

Instead, he was banished 4,400 miles away to the humid island of St Helena, where it was so damp his playing cards stuck together unless kept in the oven — one of the typical small details that makes Roberts’s book an epic joy.
