On December 8, 2006, Jose Mourinho was midway through a season that would see him deliver the FA Cup and League Cup double when he famously quipped about his ‘untouchable’ players.

‘Claude Makelele is untouchable because of the way he plays. Michael Essien is untouchable because of the way he plays. It is not because I love them,’ he said, pointing out that £30.8million Andriy Shevchenko was not part of the gang.

So, Makelele was one, Essien was another, as was Michael Ballack, Ashley Cole, Ricardo Carvalho, Frank Lampard, John Terry, Didier Drogba and Petr Cech.

Chelsea's six 'untouchables' were named in the starting XI to face Burnley.

They are Terry, Ivanovic, Matic, Fabregas, Hazard and Costa.

Azpilicueta, Cahill and Willian – all not 'untouchable' – were bumped as Luis, Zouma and Cuadrado were selected.

Nine in total that never needed to worry about whether their name was or wasn’t on the team sheet when it was pinned on the board. 

They were the permanent fixtures and, nine years on, the idea hasn’t changed.

Terry, Branislav Ivanovic, Nemanja Matic, Cesc Fabregas, Eden Hazard and Diego Costa are the automatic picks these days. Choose any at random and there’s method in Mourinho’s madness.

Hazard, for example, is a given. Dribbles and chances created  aside, he has turned buying fouls into an art form. 

Nine against Paris-Saint Germain – a record in the Champions League this season. As well as 28 fouls in Europe this year – more than any other player – and 74 in the Barclays Premier League – again, more than anyone else.

Terry, the club captain, is the leader. Ivanovic, blood-stained boots et al, is the warrior. And so on.

Yet what about those not free from rotation? 

The healthy competition among the rest starts at the back between goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and Petr Cech. So much so that Mourinho likes to imagine football as being about nine outfield players and two goalkeepers.

‘We would give no chance to anyone,’ he says, imaging that scenario. ‘We would be absolutely phenomenal because they’re both phenomenal.’ He’s not wrong.

Courtois is close to ‘untouchable’ but not quite. 

His error against Manchester City at Stamford Bridge on January 31 – failing to collect a Jesus Navas cross under pressure from James Milner – allowed David Silva to equalise.

It led to speculation Cech would reappear in Paris on Tuesday night, particularly given he has yet to concede in 426 minutes of Premier League football this year. 

He didn’t, Courtois remained, and it proved the right call.

Courtois made five saves against PSG – some point blank, some pure reaction – helping Chelsea escape the French capital with an away goal and the advantage at 1-1.

As Mourinho repeats, if a player is to become ‘untouchable because of the way he plays’, then the ex-Atletico Madrid loanee did himself no harm.

And so to another contest at Chelsea, between Kurt Zouma and Gary Cahill. 

The latter may previously have been considered ‘untouchable’, but that’s changed.

Zouma, particularly against Manchester City at Stamford Bridge, looks far from a 20-year-old newbie. That perfectly-timed tackle on Aguero, for example, showed experience beyond the France youth’s years. 

Yet against PSG, Cahill and his 33 England caps were preferred by Mourinho.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic, all 6ft 3in of the Sweden international, tormented the defender. 

Cahill was arguably at fault for Edinson Cavani’s goal, too, misjudging the cross and allowing the forward to nod the ball beyond a helpless Courtois. 

Not the most convincing performance if he is to persuade Mourinho to prefer him over Zouma.

This is a position very much available, and Chelsea captain Terry sympathises with the one that loses out: ‘Obviously we all want to play every game. 

'Those two are fighting it out at the moment but it could be me at any time. What’s important is that we remain top of the league and everybody gets game time.’

Another battle at the back is between Filipe Luis and Cesar Azpilicueta. Yet the latter has made twice as many appearances (20) as the former (10) in the Premier League this year.

Luis last played in the Premier League more than a month ago against Swansea City at the Liberty Stadium on January 17, when Azpilicueta was absent due to a groin injury.

The former Atletico Madrid left-back was used in the two Capital One Cup legs against Liverpool but the £16m buy has not made an appearance in February yet. 

Azpilicueta AKA ‘Dave’ relishes the healthy battle, most likely because he is winning.

‘In the big teams, there is always competition and the competition helps us to improve,' he said before Christmas.

'I like the competition and fight for my place every day.

'I like the competition because it brings you to another level, and it’s down to each player to impress the manager and make it difficult for him.’

Luis, playing second fiddle, is losing this contest and there doesn't seem to be a whole lot he can do about it.

The newest addition to Chelsea’s squad, Juan Cuadrado, has arrived to interrupt Willian’s otherwise must-pick status.

In seven fewer appearances in Serie A, Cuadrado has  twice as many goals (4) and assists (4) as Willian in the Premier League. 

He has also created more chances (36) and shots on target (20) than Willian (26 and 15). 

It was Cuadrado that registered more assists (4) than any other player at the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, too.

Willian has been Mourinho’s first-choice right winger this year. 

Yet perhaps his shortcomings in the final third can see his Colombian counterpart – a £23.3m buy rising to £26.8m from Fiorentina – capitalise.

Comparing one player’s form in Serie A to another’s in the Premier League can only be used to an extent, but the numbers speak for themselves.

Cuadrado seems to know a thing or two about winning fouls as, like Hazard, he has won 87 in just 1,450 minutes of football.

Yet he must replicate his performances from Italy, if he is to keep Willian out. 

Time will tell.

Those that live on the fringe of Mourinho’s team often can’t hack it.

The ‘reject XI’ that have left the club since Mourinho’s return to Chelsea in 2013 is telling. Mark Schwarzer in goal, with Ryan Bertrand, David Luiz, Jeffrey Bruma and Ashley Cole filling a back four. Then, there’s Essien and Lampard in midfield – both former ‘untouchable’ players – behind Andre Schurrle, Juan Mata and Kevin De Bruyne. And, as a lone striker, Romelu Lukaku.

Mourinho is not afraid to rotate the big names, and get rid. Lampard, now at Manchester City, knows that better than most.

‘I’m not the kind of coach that gives places to people just because they are faces or names,’ the Chelsea manager announced in 2007. ‘Everybody with me has to fight for his place.’

The  roles of Terry, Ivanovic, Matic, Fabregas, Hazard and Costa have made them immune to being dropped. It’s now up to the others to join them on the pedestal.
