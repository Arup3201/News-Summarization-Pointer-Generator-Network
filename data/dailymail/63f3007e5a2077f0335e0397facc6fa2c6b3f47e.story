Witnesses watched in horror as a 2m-long python strangled a wallaby and then dragged it away to devour it - right in front of their eyes.

The incident happened outside Pravina De Beer's Katherine home on Uralla Road.

She was hosting a dinner party when her guests told her about the live nature show happening just metres away.

They watched on as the 2m-long olive snake snake squeezed the last breaths out of the wallaby, with some guests dumbfounded by the display and took photos.

The snake started eating the wallaby at 5pm and when they returned at 8.45pm there were no traces of what had happened.

'I had some guests from New Zealand on holiday and they couldn’t believe it,' Ms De Beer told NT News today.

But this incident was one of many that happened near Ms de Beer's property.

NT wildlife experts have seen pythons in the area as long as 3.8 metres

She said there were a lot of kangaroos and snakes in the area.

Ms De Beer recalled one incident where a snake ate a baby goat under her house.

Northern Territory reptile expert David 'Reedy' Reed said it was uncommon for people to see a python kill a wallaby.

It can take a python less than a minute to capture and kill a wallaby

'Every year I would get two or three people calling me who see that exact circumstance,' he said.

'I get call-outs for olive pythons who eat things from fully grown maltese terriers to people’s cats, but more commonly ducks and poultry.

'I've met some really big pythons in the last month that are around 3.8m.'

Mr Reed said most of the time pythons used an ambush method to trap their prey.

'It’s hard sneak up on a wallaby,' he said.

'(The pythons) ambush the wallabies.

'They sit and wait where wallabies normally trail and feed, and then pounce.

'It then constricts it and then it will swallow it whole.

'The process from the time it grabs it and kills it would not last more than a minute.

'Then it would swallow it whole which would take a good hour or so.'

This particular python will not eat for at least four months, depending on when it wakes up from hibernation.
