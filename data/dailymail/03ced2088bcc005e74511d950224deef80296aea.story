A severed goat’s head has been delivered to Wrigley Field, addressed to Chicago Cubs owner Tom Ricketts.

The horrific prank recalls the team's infamous 'Curse of the Billy Goat' in which a local bar owner said the Cubs would never win the World Series after the team barred him from bringing his goat into a game in 1945.

The latest incident occurred Wednesday at about 2:30 p.m. when a man in an unmarked truck dropped off the ‘intimidating package,’ to a security guard.

Goats have been part of Cubs folklore since the owner of the Billy Goat Tavern placed a curse on the team during the 1945 World Series

Hate mail: Chicago Cubs owner Tom Ricketts was sent a severed goat's head at the stadium on Wednesday. Ricketts is trying to renovate the historic Wrigley Field and increase the number of night games played

Cubs spokesman Julian Green said an unidentified person dropped off the goat’s head at Gate K of the ballpark.

Chicago police are now investigating the incident.

The Cubs are in the middle of highly publicized negotiations with city officials and neighborhood interests regarding proposed $500 million renovation plans at the famed and historic ballpark, which first opened in 1914.

The proposed renovations include install a Jumbotron-like scoreboard and increasing the number of night games from 30 to as many as 55, reports The Chicago Tribune.

The Cubs’ game Wednesday against the Brewers was postponed, but due to rain rather than the goat’s head incident.

A spokesman for Ricketts did not comment.

Billy Goat Tavern owner William Sianis apparently placed a curse on the team during the 1945 World Series when his pet goat Murphy was denied entry into Wrigley Field. 

He even asked the owner of the Cubs, P.K. Wrigley for admission. Wrigley replied, 'Let Billy in, but not the goat.'

The story goes that Sianis became enraged, threw up his arms and vowed, 'The Cubs ain't gonna win no more. The Cubs will never win a World Series so long as the goat is not allowed in Wrigley Field.'

Bad call: This is the moment when enraged Cubs fan William Sianis put a curse on the Cubbies, vowing they would never win the World Series again because the team denied entry to his beloved pet

The Cubs went on to lose that World Series - and have never even been back to the Fall Classic since.

The Cubs, who became known as 'Lovable Losers,' have since been known as a cursed franchise, known for incredibly bad luck on the field.

In 1969, the Cubs jumped out to huge lead and looked like they were headed to their first World Series in 24 years.

Curse continues: Fan Steve Bartman reaches out and interferes with Cubs outfielder Moises Alou during the playoffs in 2003. Many Cubs fan blame the team losing this game on the Curse of the Billy Goat

But a late season collapse, combined with the 'Miracle Mets' overtaking them, meant they had to 'wait till next year.'

In 1984, then Cubs owners, the Tribune Company, tried to reverse the curse and invited the goat to opening day at Wrigley Field. 

They won the division that year and were just eight outs away from winning the National League Championship Series and playing in the World Series.

But they were unable to claim victory in that game and lost the next two, and the curse continued.

The team has only had 15 winning seasons between 1946 and 2003, when they suffered perhaps the most memorable collapse in baseball postseason history.

After winning the first round, their first playoff series victory since 1908, they were just five outs away from clinching a World Series birth against the Florida Marlins.

When a pop out was hit towards shallow left field, it appeared the team would be one out closer from finally ending the curse.

But fan Steve Bartman also reached for the foul ball, and outfielder Moises Alou was unable to make the play.

Despite leading 3-0, the team quickly unraveled, losing the game and then the following night, and once again the curse lived on.

Bartman became a citywide pariah and was been forced to change his name and leave Chicago for fear of his safety.
