Phil Mickelson has won his first British Open Championship.

Five weeks after finishing runner-up at the US Open for the sixth time, Mickelson came from behind Sunday to win the Open, his fifth career major. The path to one of his greatest victories was longer than most, but Mickelson feels it's the greatest win of his career.

Embraced by his family near the 18th hole, Mickelson celebrated the win after coming from two shots behind leader Justin Rose by shooting a week-best round of 66 at Muirfield.

Mickelson, 43, fended off late challenges from several golfers to clinch the title in front of his wife Amy and children, Amanda, Evan and Sophia.

The world's number two golfer, Mickelson has famously battled through much adversity during his career.

The British Open champ announced in 2010 that he had been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. Though treatable, the condition can create severe pain in the feet and tendinitis in the Achilles tendon, among other issues. He has said that his case is manageable.

'What a fun day. This is some of the best golf I have ever played,' said Mickelson.

Mickelson's last major came at the 2010 Masters, which he also won in 2006 and 2004. His other major was the 2005 PGA Championship.

In May 2009, Mickelson announced that he would take a leave of absence from professional golf after his wife Amy was diagnosed with breast cancer. His leave of absence was to be indefinite, pending the outcome of Amy's treatment.

Mickelson missed two tournaments while his wife underwent surgery and treatments. Pro golfers banded together wearing pink as a show of support for Mickelson's family.

When told less than two weeks later that the surgery and ensuing treatment had been successful after doctors caught the cancer at an early stage, Mickelson announced he would return to pro golf.

Less than a month later, Mickelson's mother Mary was diagnosed with breast cancer, causing him to take another leave of absence. He returned after she began to show improvement, but not without a nod to the man who saved the lives of the two most important women in his life.

Mickelson invited Tom Buchholz, the radiation oncologist who treated both women,to be his caddy during the 2010 Houston Open after learning the man was a tour caddy in 1984, and then again during an exclusive Par 3 tournament at Augusta National the day before the 2012 Masters Championship, according to CultureMap Houston.

'Playing this championship was the 
biggest challenge of my career and I didn't know if I had the skills to 
win on links golf but I played some of the best links golf I have ever 
played,' Mickelson said after the tournament.

'It is amazing to be part of any Open Championship and to win at Muirfield feels amazing... this is probably the greatest and most difficult win of my career.'

Mickelson's British Open victory came only weeks after he finished second at the U.S. Open for the sixth time, a defeat he called as difficult as any he's dealt with in his career.

'I have such an incredible difference of emotions from where I was a month ago with such a heart-breaking loss at the US Open,' Mickelson said.

Frustration? Woods rarely appeared inspired

Tiger Woods made a late charge towards the front of the pack Sunday, but the world's number one golfer came up short, finishing tied for sixth overall.
