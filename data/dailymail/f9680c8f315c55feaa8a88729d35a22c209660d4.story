Lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone has been bombarded with so many abusive threats since she spoke out against independence that she no longer feels safe in Scotland.

The Glasgow-born and based Ultimo founder was subjected to a vitriolic social media hate campaign after becoming one of only a few business leaders to come out in favour of the Union.

Speaking for the first time about the online abuse, she said: ‘It’s a very sad day when you can’t voice an opinion without getting threats.

Pro-Union: Michelle Mone was one of the few Scottish business leaders to speak out against independence

‘Yet, for the first time, I don’t feel safe in Scotland and that’s horrible. It’s my home.’

Ms Mone, 42, took to Twitter to express her fears about an independent Scotland’s £6 billion deficit and the risk of losing the pound. And she vowed to move to England if Scotland voted Yes in the referendum on September 18.

After receiving a stream of abuse in response, the mother of three added: ‘Can’t believe the amount of hatred this vote is causing. It’s extremely sad & will no doubt cause damage either way to the country I love.’

One troll wrote: ‘The quicker we vote yes, the quicker u get to f*** ya tramp!’

In June, vicious Twitter trolls targeted Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling, who has lived in Scotland for 21 years, after she revealed she had made a £1 million donation to the No campaign.

Last night, Ms Mone revealed she had been subjected to similar comments. She said: ‘I have absolutely no problem with people expressing an opinion, but if you are going to be disrespectful, I don’t want to hear it.

'I’ve been called a “****”, a “cow”, a “slut”, as well as being told “I’m going to get it”, “we’ll come and get you” and they’re “going to throw me across the border”.

‘I’m not a murderer, a thief or a rapist. I’m a good person who employs a lot of people in Scotland, both Yes and No supporters, and we all get on.

‘We should all be able to live in a country where you can express views and not be vilified for it.’

But Ms Mone says her commercial experience tells her that ‘Alex Salmond’s business plan is flawed’.
