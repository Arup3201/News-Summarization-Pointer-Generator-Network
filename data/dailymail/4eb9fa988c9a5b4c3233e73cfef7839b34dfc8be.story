When they first met, he was brandishing a large knife and his victim was bravely trying to defend his family business with a stool.

But after being caught red-handed career criminal Oluwatobi Ogunbanwo adopted a somewhat different approach.

In an extraordinary hand-written letter from prison, he begged for forgiveness from shopkeeper Eamon McCluskey and offered his ‘humblest apologies’.

Forgiven: In this image taken from the CCTV footage of the robbery, Mr McCluskey can be seen defending himself against armed robber Oluwatobi Ogunbanwo

The armed robber went on to say that a ‘hardworking taxpayer’ deserves to be able to make a ‘decent living’ without the crook ‘taking what is yours’.

The letter was passed to Mr McCluskey by police after Ogunbanwo was jailed for eight years for a robbery spree.

He struck at his newsagent in Wimbledon Park, South West London, as Mr McCluskey was about to shut up shop for the night in February.

Wearing a mask over the lower half of his face and armed with a knife, he leapt on the counter screaming at the business owner to hand over his takings.

His terrified 51-year-old victim grabbed a stool which he used to fend off the attacker as he tried to escape and shouted for help.

'I'm sorry I robbed you with a butcher's knife': Oluwatobi Ogunbanwo, 22, wrote this letter of apology to Mr McCluskey for robbing his newsagent in Wimbledon Park, South West London

Attack: During the robbery, Mr McCluskey defended himself with a stool and threw beer bottles at the young criminal as he jumped over the counter bearing a knife

Ogunbanwo climbed over the counter and removed the till from the shop, making off with £60 which police found on his person when they arrested hm a short time later

But Ogunbanwo blocked him in behind the counter and Mr McCluskey threw bottles of beer at him in a desperate last attempt at self-defence.

At that point robber wrenched the entire till off its base and fled down the street, where he had stashed his coat under a parked car.

Mr McCluskey’s 78-year-old mother was in the back of the shop and ‘had the shock of her life’ when she came to see what all the commotion was about.

Luckily, police were alerted by vigilant neighbours within seconds of the start of the robbery and intercepted the robber less than a mile away.

He stole just £60 which was found in his pockets.

The horrifying ordeal was caught on 
CCTV camera and was the latest in three similar raids in three years at 
the cornershop, which Mr McCluskey’s parents opened in 1962.

The businessman was so upset by the robbery that he attended Kingston Crown Court to see the young criminal jailed.

Afterwards, a detective approached him and passed him the neatly written letter from the defendant.

In it, Ogunbanwo said: ‘A hardworking 
tax-payer like yourself deserves to be able to make a decent living 
without myself taking what is yours and has not business to do with me.

‘I
 apologise for any distress I caused your mother or yourself and for any
 further damaged caused. I genuinely had no intention to harm you in any
 way, but that is still no excuse for my action or for any fear I may 
have caused.

‘My mother works in Tesco and I could only imagine how angry I would be if somebody did that to her.’

Big heart: Eamon McCluskey, pictured at his shop in Wimbledon, has said he forgives the robber for what he did after his letter

Speaking last night, Mr McCluskey, 51, said it took him two days to open the letter but he believes the apology is genuine.

‘When I came out of court a police 
officer said he had written me a letter. It was early and I was very 
upset. I didn’t read it for a few days.

Dear Mr Eamon McCluskey,

Before I go any further please let me express my humblest apologies in regards to the robbery that took place at your store.

A hardworking tax-payer like yourself deserves to be able to make a decent living without myself taking what is yours and has not business to do with me.

I apologise for any distress I caused your mother or yourself and for any further damaged caused. I genuinely had no intention to harm you in any way, but that is still no excuse for my action or for any fear I may have caused.

My mother works in Tesco and I could only imagine how angry I would be if somebody did that to her.

Both my actions and behaviour towards you were cruel and I sincerely apologise for that.

Yours sincerely.

Tobi Ogunbanwo

‘Maybe he was remorseful about the robbery. He wanted to apologise for what he had done. I’m sure he meant it.’

Mr McCluskey said the 22-year-old robber had only been out of prison for 10 days after serving a shorter sentence for similar crimes.

He described him as a ‘serial offender’ and said the court was told he had been committing serious crimes since the age of 18.

Describing the robbery, the shopkeeper said he had recently installed panic buttons and a remote door lock but had become ‘blasé’.

He said: ‘I saw the knife as soon as he came in the door.

'He had a mask on his nose like a motorbike mask and he had a butcher’s knife raised in his right hand.

‘He came to the counter and I went to the security door to get out but he got there before I did.

'I thought "I have to get out of here or he will kill me or do me harm.’’

He said: ‘I am glad it’s over now - time is a healer and everything is back to normal now.’

Ogunbanwo, known as Tobi, of Battersea, admitted four robberies and three attempted robberies across Merton and Wandsworth.
