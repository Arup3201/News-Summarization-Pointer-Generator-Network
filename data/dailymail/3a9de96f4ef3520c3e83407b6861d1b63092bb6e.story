Police have made five arrests in connection with the death of three teenage girls who were killed by a hit-and-run driver while trick-or-treating.

Twins Lexi Perez and Alexandra Perez and Andrea Gonzalez, all aged 13, were in Santa Ana for Halloween when they were hit by a truck while crossing the road.

Officers made arrests on Sunday morning during the search for two suspects who are believed to have fled the scene in the aftermath, dumping their damaged SUV before escaping on foot.

Authorities would not release any information about those in custody or being questioned.

Victims: Twins Lexi Perez and Alexandra Perez, 13, were run down and killed by a hit-and-run driver while out trick-or-treating in Santa Ana, Southern California, on Friday night 

Tragic: Andrea Gonzalez, also 13, was killed as she tried to cross the road with their friends 

Police are still searching for the two suspects in the car at the time the three girls, including the twins (pictured) were hit. They were said to be in costume and carrying candy bags at the time

A witness told the Los Angeles Times the girls were wearing costumes with black leggings and dark clothing when they were hit in a crosswalk near an elementary school about 6:45 p.m. Friday. 

Magaly Huerta, the twins' aunt, says her family is in complete shock. She told ABC 7 : They killed what we love the most. Why couldn't they stop the car when they saw my nieces? Why they couldn't do anything? I know God will punish them sooner or later.'

The girl's mother said: 'I cannot believe this.' 

The Alexandra and Lexi Perez Huerta Memorial Fund Facebook page was created Saturday and asked for donations for the girls' funeral expenses.

Family, friends and residents left flowers and lit candles for the trio following the tragic incident. Some remained at the memorial site all day as they tried to come to terms with the loss. 

A 2001 Honda CRV, the vehicle which is believed to have been driven into them, was found nearby after officers said the suspects sped off and headed north. 

Sharon Stewart, who cuts hair at a nearby barber shop, told the Times that she was eating outside when she heard what sounded like a terrible crash and screaming. She said she turned around and saw a car leaving and people yelling, so she got in her car and followed.

Stewart said she saw a young man run from the scene and heard him yelling at what she thought was his companion.

Maria Ramirez, 14, who lives about a half block from where the hit-and-run occurred, told The Orange County Register that she attended middle school with the twins. She last saw them at school Friday, she said.

'I can't believe it happened,' Ramirez said of the deaths of her friends, while she gathered late Friday night on the sidewalk with dozens of onlookers. 'They were fun, good girls.' 

Jeff Evans, who was trick-or-treating with his eight-year-old daughter nearby at the time said he heard squealing tires, looked over and saw the gruseome scene.

He told the O.C Register: 'When we got over here, there was already a tarp over two girls,' Evans said.

Briana Magana, 13, said she attended Santiago Charter Middle School  with one of the victims.

She told the paper the pair had attended a school dance earlier in the day and had later gone for lunch at McDonald's. 

'It's unbelievable how something like this could happen,' Briana said. 'She always had a smile, she would light up the room, and she was just a really good student.'

One witness followed the SUV involved in the incident. When they stopped they reported seeing two men get out of the vehicle and flee on foot.

Department Cpl. Anthony Bertagna told the station: 'Witnesses say the vehicle was traveling at a high-rate of speed. I didn't see any skid marks, so it doesn't appear they slowed down whatsoever.

'They left these three young women laying in the street, and left without calling, without stopping, without rendering aid. It's hard to even fathom doing that.'

'At this point, we need the community's help, anybody that saw these individuals. Did they call somebody? Did they get picked up? Were they seen running on foot past the freeway?' Bertagna said. 'People are going to be talking about this. These individuals could be talking about this.'

Scene: The trio who were hit were all said to be in costume and carrying candy bags at the time

Police cordon: Witnesses said they heard the squealing of tires and ran over to see tarp sheets already over two of the girls 

Response: Paramedics rushed to the crash site but two of the girls were pronounced dead at the scene. The third died while she was being taken to hospital
