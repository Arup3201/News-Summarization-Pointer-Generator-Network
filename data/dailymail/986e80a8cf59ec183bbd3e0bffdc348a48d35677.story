'Killer': Michael Chadd Boysen admitted to strangling his grandparents, Norma and Robert Taylor

A mentally unstable man has pleaded guilty to strangling his grandparents after they welcomed him home from prison with a party.

Michael Chadd Boysen, 27, was arrested following a manhunt in March for allegedly killing Norma and Robert Taylor at their home in Renton, Washington.

Boysen, who has suffered from a range of mental illnesses and has tried to kill himself 12 times since his arrest, on Friday pleaded guilty to aggravated first-degree murder.

His plea has been modified so while he has not actually admitted he is guilty, he has agreed he would be convicted if the case were to go to a jury, the Seattle Post Intelligencer reported.

He now faces a mandatory sentence of 
life without parole at his sentencing later this year. The County 
prosecutor opted not to seek the death penalty for the alleged murderer.

Boysen
killed his grandfather, 82, and grandmother, 80, just hours after they 
threw him a party celebrating his release from state prison on March 8. 
He had served nine months for a burglary conviction and authorities said
there was nothing particularly alarming about his record

Scene: Their strangled bodies were found in their bedroom the next day and police launched a manhunt

But
family members revealed after the killings that Boysen had made threats
against members of his family and law enforcement officers while he was
behind bars.

The Taylors' strangled bodies were found in their bedroom closet the next day by their daughter.

Investigators
soon determined that Boysen had killed the couple and then fled in 
their car, taking cash and a credit card from their home. He also 
allegedly took jewelery he then sold at a pawn shop.

As police launched a manhunt, staff at a motel in Lincoln City, Oregon recognized Boysen from a news report and alerted police that he had checked in. Officers swarmed the scene.

During the siege, police pointed rifles at the motel, fired blasts from a water cannon and used a bullhorn to try to persuade Boysen to give up.

Caught: He was found in a motel and taken into custody after a stand-off with police. He now faces life in prison without the possibility of parole and officials say he has repeatedly tried to kill himself

Officers eventually stormed his room, finding him inside with self-inflicted wounds.

He was taken into custody, where he has been deemed mentally ill. No motive has been given for the killings.

He
has harmed himself 12 times since his arrest and now spends much of his
time strapped to a bed or a backboard, the Seattle PI reported.

According to King County Jail staff, he has harmed himself with a variety of items including an orange seed and has pulled out his stitches.
