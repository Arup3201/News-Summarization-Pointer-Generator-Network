A genealogist who tracked down her long-lost father and turned the reunion into a television show on Oprah is being sued by the man she now calls 'dad' after he claimed the story is not true.

Pamela Slaton first claimed retired mortician Vincent Oleniak was her estranged father in a book after tracing him to New York. Her story was then picked up by Oprah Winfrey's cable channel OWN.

In the tome, entitled Reunited: An Investigative Genealogist Unlocks Some of Life’s Greatest Family Mysteries, Slaton writes: 'We may not be living out the father-daughter fairy tale, but it matters to me that he exists.'

Claims: Pamela Slaton first claimed retired mortician Vincent Oleniak was her estranged father in a book called Reunited: An Investigative Genealogist Unlocks Some of Life’s Greatest Family Mysteries

She goes on to attack Oleniak 
claiming he is a Mob-linked lothario who abandoned his child because of his misogyny, the New York Post reported.

The
book was later turned into a documentary that ran for three months in 
2011 on Oprah's channel before it was cancelled due to low ratings.

Now,
a lawsuit filed at Manhattan Supreme Court says that Oleniak 'never 
acknowledged paternity' and that the author 'has knowingly, 
intentionally and falsely identified [him] as her biological father in 
the book'.

Plugged on Oprah: The book was later turned into a documentary that ran for three months in 2011 on Oprah Winfrey's channel OWN. Here Winfrey is pictured with (L-R) Simon Cowell, herself, Usher, Will Smith, Michael Jordon, Tom Cruise and Rosie O'Donnell during the taping of 'Oprah's Surprise Spectacular' in 2011

He claims he knew Slaton when she was young but that he only began a relationship with her mother when she was already pregnant.

The
suit also names Slaton’s publisher, Macmillan, and her ghost writer, 
Samantha Marshall, while Winfrey and her channel are not named.

Oleniak, who hails from The Bronx, is seeking undisclosed compensatory and punitive damages. He refused to comment.

Slaton also declined to comment.
