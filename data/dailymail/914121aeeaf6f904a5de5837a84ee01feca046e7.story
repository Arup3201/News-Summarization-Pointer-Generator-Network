It was supposed to be a fun family meal out with a Happy Meal treat for their four-year-old daughter. 

But Neil and Nikki Sanders had their evening in McDonald's soured when they discovered what looked like a worm hanging out of the Chicken McNugget they had purchased. 

Emily, four, had turned down the Happy Meal even before seeing the wriggly surprise, so it was left to her mother to take the first bite from the McNugget. 

Nikki Sanders, 30, went to take a bite from a Chicken McNugget in her daughter's Happy Meal when she found what looked like a worm hanging out the bottom of it 

Neil and Nikki Sanders had taken their four-year-old daughter to the McDonald's in Tamworth and bought a Happy Meal, which had a worm or maggot in one of the Chicken McNuggets

But she felt sick when she found the foreign body in her daughter's Happy Meal from the McDonald's in Ventura Park, in Tamworth.

Mrs Sanders, 30, a canteen worker from Atherstone, told the Birmingham Mail: 'I'm very fussy about what I eat and when I saw what was in the McNugget I went white.

'I'm just thankful Emily decided she didn't want her Happy Meal.

'One good thing has come out of this, though. It's turned me off processed meat. I'm eating a lot healthier now.'

Mrs Sanders, a canteen worker, said the unfortunate experience had turned her off processed food

Her husband added: 'It looks like a worm, but I can't swear it's one until tests have been carried out.

'Whatever it is, it shouldn't be in there.'

The 39-year-old vehicle testing engineer took the McNugget to a staff member, who allegedly told him: 'We'll sort you out with something.' 

He replied saying: 'I don't want a voucher. I want an explanation.' 

He has since handed the item to the store for tests.

The couple had purchased the Happy Meal for their daughter Emily, four, from this McDonald's restaurant in the Ventura Retail Park, in Tamworth

McDonalds told MailOnline an investigation is currently underway. 

A spokesman said: 'We are sorry for Mr Sanders' experience when visiting our restaurant. 

'Food safety is our highest priority and both our restaurants and our suppliers place great emphasis on quality control and follow rigorous standards in order to avoid imperfections in our products.

'We have launched an investigation following the reporting of this incident, and the object will be sent to a specialist for identification. 

'We will be in touch with Mr Sanders once this investigation is complete.'
