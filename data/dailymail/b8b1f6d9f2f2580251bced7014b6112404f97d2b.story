A Wisconsin father convicted of abuse for starving his teenage daughter down to 68 pounds was sentenced to just five years in prison.

Before being sentenced by Dane County Circuit Judge Julie Genovese, Chad Chritten, 42, read a statement insisting his daughter suffered from severe emotional and behavioral problems that he couldn't handle, that his job as a trucker kept him away from home and that he didn't notice how thin she had become.

‘There was no master plan against my daughter,’ the man said, his voice breaking at times. ‘I was bailing water from a sinking boat with my bare hands.’

Failed father: Chad Chritten, 42, was found guilty of starving and neglecting his daughter for a number of years until she escaped wearing only pajamas

The case came to light in February 
2012 when the girl, then 15, ran away from her family's Madison home and
 was picked up by a passing motorist. The girl told investigators she 
had spent most of the previous five years confined to the home's 
basement and was denied food.

Genovese
 said it was clear the girl had problems and that everyone who 
encountered her failed her. But, she told the father, ‘it's your turn to
 accept your part in this.’

‘What
 I think you did was put your head in the sand. It's your job as a dad 
to see it and you didn't. Really, the buck stops with you,’ the judge 
said.

The girl also told 
investigators that her stepmother beat her, her stepbrother repeatedly 
forced her to perform oral sex on him and she was forced to eat her 
feces and drink her own urine.

‘They
 made me feel like I was dehumanized a lot,’ the girl said in a letter 
to Genovese. ‘It's all thanks to my stupid dad and stepmom for not 
giving me an education and keeping me locked up for most of my life and 
making me feel like I was in a scary spot in my life.’

Genovese
 sentenced the stepmother, Melinda Drabek-Chritten, to five years in 
prison this summer after the woman pleaded no contest to reckless 
endangerment and causing mental harm to a child. The stepbrother is set 
to stand trial on sexual assault charges next month.

The
 father went through two trials. Jurors in March deadlocked on some 
charges, leading to a second proceeding in November. In all, he was 
convicted of child neglect, child abuse, reckless endangerment and 
causing mental harm to a child, all felonies. He was acquitted of false 
imprisonment and misdemeanor neglect.

'This is so far from a mistake': Assistant District Attorney Matthew Moeser argued during the trial that the abuse ongoing, and hardly an error in judgement

He's a simple man: Defense attorney Jessa Nicholson tried to convince the jury her client didn't have the smarts to mastermind the torture - they didn't bite

During
 his November trial, the man testified he believed the girl's stepfather
 sexually assaulted her in Texas. After the father brought the girl to 
live with him in Wisconsin, she refused to eat and threatened to kill 
the family in their sleep, he said.

A
 psychologist suggested the girl live on a different level than the rest
 of the family, he testified, but he denied locking her in the basement.
 Social workers made several visits to the home, but he couldn't follow 
up on her care because he was always on the road. He said social workers
 should have removed her from the home.

The
 man had faced up to 28 years in prison going into Wednesday's 
sentencing. District Attorney Ismael Ozanne asked Genovese to give the 
man 10 years behind bars, saying he and his wife kept the girl isolated 
because they didn't want her to tell anyone she was being abused.

‘The
 course of conduct would have ended in (the girl's) death but for her 
courage to run away,’ Ozanne said. Asked after the sentencing if he 
agreed with five years, he simply said he respected Genovese's decision.

No master plan: Mr Chritten is alone with his thoughts as he hangs his head in court

The man's attorney, Jessa 
Nicholson, countered he deserved probation. He already has lost his 
family and his job, his wife is in prison and his reputation has been 
destroyed, she said.

‘Apparently we are still a society that favors punishment,’ she told reporters after the hearing.

Genovese
 said the man deserved the same sentence as his wife. Together they 
stole five years of the girl's life, the judge said.
