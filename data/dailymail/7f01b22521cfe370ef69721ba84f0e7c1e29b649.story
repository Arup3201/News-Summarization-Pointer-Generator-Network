For much of the past four years, James Forrest has been damaged, both physically and mentally. Ronny Deila, the Celtic manager, describes him as a 'frightened' footballer.

Self-belief was never an issue until a relentless series of muscle injuries began.

To some, Forrest is the best player Celtic have. An £8million star-in-waiting. Reduced to the role of a walk-on extra in each of the past four seasons, however, it’s hard to be certain.

‘It’s been a long time since James Forrest has been consistently good,’ said Deila. ‘But, touch wood, that’s six months without a pulled muscle and he is moving in the right direction.

‘We have been unbelievably patient with him because we have had to build him up from the bottom.’

Deila might have been describing ’70s TV character Steve Austin, The Six Million Dollar Man, rather than a winger recently rated in an altogether higher bracket.

Stripped down and carefully rebuilt in a painstaking quest to get to the heart of the injuries that have rendered him a Parkhead bystander at times, there is cautious optimism from Deila that — this time — Forrest might just be ready.

A second-half substitute and the scorer of the second goal against Dundee United, the winger was close to stealing the show in Sunday’s League Cup Final win. Yet his efforts were not appreciated by everyone.

John Guidetti’s feelings on the spot-kick Forrest won and missed were embarrassingly public.

Knocking the desk before him, however, Deila welcomed signs that the physical frailties in the Forrest make-up are healing.

‘It has been hard work building his self-belief back up, so that he won’t get these injuries,’ said the Celtic boss.

‘It has been slow. I was happy for him to score on Sunday and win a penalty.

‘But, you know, he is not even close to what he can be as a footballer.

‘I am happy he is going in the right direction — but we know there are still things to work on.

‘He has the right people around him and we know that, if we get it right, he will be a very important player for us.’

Arriving from Stromsgodset, Deila expected Forrest to be one of his key players.

A coach who revels in the relentless quest for physical improvement, the Scotland international has become his pet project. According to Deila, the balance of his body was all wrong, his running style placing strain on vulnerable muscles.

‘James has been worse than he is now,’ he said. ‘He was afraid because he had been out for two of the past four years with a lot of pulled muscles.

‘You get frightened and we need to get his confidence back and believing in himself. It has been psychological, but it has also about getting the balance and control of his body.

‘He has a great attitude and is working hard. So far, we have managed to get him out of the cycle of pulled muscles — but he has had other things, as well.

‘When you get a sore knee or twisted ankle, it affects your way of running.

‘He’s in a very good place now after 30 minutes on Sunday and 90 minutes last week, plus full training on Monday and Tuesday.’

Forrest is available for selection against Dundee United in their Scottish Cup quarter-final replay.

‘I can see he will get better and better,’ said Deila, who can call again on Adam Matthews at right-back.

‘It’s about strengthening his core, getting balance to change direction at high speeds. The medical staff have been working hard at getting it right, but now he needs more time on the pitch.

‘His body is not nearly where it should be. It takes him five days to recover from playing 90 minutes.

‘We have to be careful because, when you are tired, that’s when you get pulled muscles.

‘We have to build him up step by step. Hopefully, in six months we will be sitting feeling excited about James Forrest.’

His inclusion in Gordon Strachan’s Scotland squad to face Northern Ireland and Gibraltar surprised some as much as did the exclusion of Forrest’s new Parkhead team-mates Gary Mackay-Steven and Stuart Armstrong.

‘I am not surprised about Scotland because they are thinking the same as us,’ said Deila.

‘They know what he is able to do and his skills are so high in certain situations, like when we want pace and touch, ability in one-on-ones. Gordon will be thinking about Gibraltar and he needs players who can go past defenders.

‘Stuart and Gary have just started at Celtic and I think they need more consistency and performances. In the end, hopefully, they will be good enough to get into the squad.’

The 23-year-old did get his name on the score sheet however as Celtic beat Dundee United 2-0

After already playing for United in the Scottish Cup, neither can face their former club on Wednesday evening. Familiarity is in danger of breeding contempt between the teams and others must wish they could also excuse themselves from a third meeting in 10 days.

The three games have featured four red cards (two rescinded) and three penalty kicks. United’s keeper Rado Cierzniak has saved two of them.

To that end, Leigh Griffiths and Kris Commons will again be assigned spot-kick duties for Celtic. Guidetti, who had a spectacular public strop after Forrest held firm on Sunday, will again be told to stand aside.

‘I have not said so much,’ remarked Deila of that episode. ‘We have talked about it, but it’s nothing.

‘We had Leigh and Kris to take penalties and both were off.

‘I don’t have any problems with John as a character. He is a funny boy. He is a striker who loves scoring goals and wants to take penalties.

‘They are young players and they have to learn and use these experiences to get better.

‘We talked about the need to put the team first. There’s no point arguing inside the team.’
