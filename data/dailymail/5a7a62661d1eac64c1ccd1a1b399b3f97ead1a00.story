A new search for a teenager who went missing 24 years ago in the South Australian Outback town of Coober Pedy has been called off, just days after it recommenced.

Police had been digging up opal mining shafts in the town since Monday in the bid to solve the suspected murder of Karen Michelle Williams after receiving new information.

However, the search has failed to turn up any new evidence and has been suspended.

The 16-year-old was last seen by friends on her way home from a disco at the Coober Pedy Hotel  on 4 August, 1990.

Police charged Nikola Novakovic, 42, with Ms Williams' murder, but her body has never been found.

Police have launched a new search for the remains of Karen Michelle Williams, who was last seen in August, 1990

A South Australian police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia authorities reopened their search on Monday after two witnesses came forward with new information.

But superintendent Des Bray stated they were 'still confident' her remains were in the area despite not finding them on the search.

'We would especially like to acknowledge the assistance of SES Mine Rescue, the Coober Pedy Council and numerous local people who donated their time and equipment over a prolonged period, he said.

A $200,000 reward remains on offer to anyone who can lead police to the discovery of her remains.

Detectives and the State Emergency Service Mines Rescue team believed they were close to a breakthrough, focussing their search on 150-metre zone on the outskirts of the town. 

Police released an aerial photograph of the area where teams dug through broken bottles and other debris at the bottom of several mine shafts at the corner of Flathill Road and the Stuart Highway.

'They're very narrow and it's challenging work to actually get the rubbish out,' Superintendent Des Bray told ABC.

Police prosecutors alleged last year that Novakovich, from Kongorong in South Australia's south, offered Ms Williams and several friends a ride home from a hotel in the early hours of August 4.

Williams was allegedly left alone with Novakovich after he dropped the friends off. She was not seen again.

Superintendent Bray said investigators would search three mine shafts on Wednesday.

'We wouldn't come and put in all this effort if we didn't think that we were optimistic of finding her.' 

Anyone with information is asked to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
