Late night comedian Bill Maher has controversially described Michael Brown a 'thug' that didn't deserve to be shot and rubbished claims he was a 'gentle giant'. 

Weighing in on the conflict in Ferguson, Missouri, he urged people on both sides to 'look at the facts'.

'I'm sorry, but Michael Brown's people say he is a gentle giant,' he told viewers of HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher on Friday night.

'Well, we saw that video of when he was in that 7-Eleven. No, he wasn't a gentle giant.

Conflict: Michael Brown's death at the hands of police officer Darren Wilson (right) has ruptured the city

'He was committing a robbery and he pushed that guy. 

'He was acting like a thug, not like a gentle giant. He certainly didn't deserve to be shot for it.'

His words come as a grand jury nears its conclusion over whether police officer Darren Wilson violated Michael Brown's civil rights by shooting him dead. 

Protests sparked by the incident on August 9 are still ongoing in the city ruptured by racial divides.

Maher also took aim at people taking sides rather than objectively judging the situation.

Controversial: Maher pointed to footage of Brown 'acting like a thug in 7-Eleven' as evidence for his view

'Taking sides': He said people on both sides are ignoring the crucial facts of the matter dating back to August 9

Questions: He also questioned why police officers are siding with 'a plain murderer' like Darren Wilson

Support: Dr Cornel West, a prominent member of anti-police protests in Ferguson, agreed with Maher

'You know what else I find disturbing is that everybody in America just sides with their own people and doesn't look at the facts,' he said. 

'The cops, I saw on the news a couple of weeks ago, were wearing bracelets or something that said, "I am Darren Wilson". Why do you want to throw your lot in with this plain murderer?' 

Nodding in agreement, one of his guests Dr Cornel West, a prominent figure in the protests against Ferguson police, said: 'Michael Brown was a human being, he had flaws like all of us, he didn't deserve to be shot.' 

The rant followed one from outgoing US Attorney General Eric Holder, who is 'exasperated' by the numerous leaks of information coming from the secret tribunal. 

Shooting: Darren Wilson is pictured standing over the body of Michael Brown after he shot him six times

Outrage: The shooting sparked mass outrage in Ferguson, Missouri, with citizens calling on Wilson to resign

Underlying tensions: It has unearthed deep divides in Ferguson between the black community and white police

Holder's legacy as attorney general, a position he has held since the start of the Obama administration, has been largely shaped by his vocal advocacy for racial justice.

But unrest in the St Louis city between the majority Caucasian police force and African American community shows no signs of dying down.

The outbursts have been exacerbated by leaks from the grand jury.

Last week, leaked information indicated that Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown, was acting in self-defense.

'It appears that people are somehow trying to shape public opinion,' Holder said.  

In addition to the criminal investigation into Wilson's actions, the Justice Department is also conducting a civil investigation into the patterns and practices of the Ferguson Police Department.
