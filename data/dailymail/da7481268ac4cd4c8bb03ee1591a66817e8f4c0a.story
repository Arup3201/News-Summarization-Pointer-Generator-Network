Not many Tories attended Questions to Vince Cable’s Business Department. Perhaps they find it hard to stomach Lib Dem Vince at the despatch box. Yet that seems unlikely. Mr Cable is, in the Chamber, a polite, agreeable figure, quite unlike the incorrigible schemer lurking behind the arras.

Maybe Tories stayed away because they are driven nuts by one of their own frontbenchers, Matthew Hancock?

This M. Hancock is not the one with the beard and florid kerchiefs who has been caught up in such lurid goings-on in Portsmouth. That M. Hancock is 68-year-old Mike, formerly Lib Dem, now Independent.

Matthew Hancock, 35, entered Parliament in 2010 and is tremendously zingy and smells faintly of Haliborange tablets and Nivea shaving gel, and due to his upbeat nature is tipped to be Tory leader

This one is Matthew, 35 going on 29. He is tremendously zingy and smells faintly of Haliborange tablets and Nivea shaving gel.

He entered Parliament in 2010 via a safe seat in Suffolk (its previous MP was tossed a peerage).

Having scorched through both Oxford and Cambridge, young Hancock became close to George Osborne. Within five minutes he was on the Public Accounts Committee. In 2012 he became Minister for Skills, Enterprise and (dread phrase) Lifelong Learning.

It will be a surprise, not least to Master Hancock himself, if he is not Tory leader by 2020.

His upbeat manner is suited to his job. He is the sort of person who, on entering the dayroom of an old people’s home, will spank his palms and say ‘right, troops, what’s the plan of action today?’

House of Commons Speaker John Bercow gives no impression of liking Mr Hancock

If you went on holiday with Mr Hancock he would likely have you out doing star jumps on the beach before breakfast. He is a doer, a delver, a tireless Tigger.

Yesterday he was ‘delighted to tell the House’ – with fizzy eyes and much emphasis on the ‘light’ and ‘tell’ – that the Government was ‘well on track’ to establishing two million apprenticeships. Indeed! Only that very dawn had come news that 1.8million such posts have now been achieved.

He imparted this statistic with such relish that it was almost as if he personally had met every single one of those young apprentices. And their parents.

Speaker Bercow gives no impression of liking Mr Hancock. He utters his name with what sounds like sarcasm – ‘Min-i-ster Hannnncock’, dripping with fake gravity. The Speaker also cut in on the end of Mr Hancock’s replies, chivvying him, letting it be known that the content of his replies was of sparse significance to the Chair. Envy? Bercow himself never went far as a frontbencher. Mr Hancock, too shrewd to give Bercow the satisfaction of open irritation, looked at the Speaker with the waggy smile of Basil Brush.

‘Thank you very MUCH, Mr Speaker,’ he said. And he patted the despatch box with his palms, familiar as an old pro. Bercow grimaced.

Many Tories talk about ‘our long-term economic plan’ but they manage to load the slogan with self-knowing.

Labour is still wailing that David Cameron should have known that Andy Coulson, left, was bad news

Mr Hancock bellowed it forth, believing it. He talked about something called ‘The Trailblazer Process’ as though we would all be familiar with that great enterprise.

Jack Lopresti, a decent, soft-spoken Tory from the Bristol area, asked about apprentice aerospace workers at Filton. Mr Hancock swooped to announce, with zeal, that apprenticeships at Filton were up by 60 per cent. The man was, and is, a marvel, relentlessly, exhaustingly, manically optimistic. No wonder his backbench elders find the young pup a trial.

Later the House heard of dreadful misdeeds by Jimmy Savile. Officialdom wrung its hands and wished it had known he was a wrong ’un. It must have missed a book I wrote in 2008 which hinted, as heavily as the libel lawyers would permit, that Savile was a groping fraud.

Meanwhile, Labour is still wailing that David Cameron should have known Andy Coulson was bad news. I sometimes wrote for Coulson when he was an editor.

I always found him bright, civilised and grown-up. The way he has conducted himself this week, stoical in his bleakest hour, gives me no reason to change that view.
