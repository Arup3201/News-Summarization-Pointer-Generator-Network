Demands: Russian leader Vladimir Putin has called for an overhaul of the country's military hardware

Vladimir Putin has ordered the modernisation of Russia's armaments on the same scale as achieved by Stalin at the height of his reign of terror.

The Kremlin leader made clear he was tired of Western jibes about the country's outdated firepower as displayed at annual Red Square parades.

He is even thought to have reference the former dictators era as he told top security officials: 'We must modernise our defence industry as comprehensively as it was done in the 1930s.'

He rapped his defence chiefs for failing to draw up plans to meet his ambitious demands for a giant leap forward in Russia's military capability which has slipped since the end of the Cold War.

Stalin developed Soviet firepower in the 1930s after revolutionising the country's outmoded tsarist-era industry.

But his ruthless state-controlled campaign was based on repression on a grand scale by the secret police and use of slave labour.

Outdated: Putin has become angry at the state of defence technology, which go on show every year during the parade in Red Square

Putin has committed Russian to 
spending £450 billion on a massive armaments programme in the next 
decade, a modernisation that will include 400 ballistic missiles, 600 
warplanes and a new fleet of state-of-the-art submarines.

As when Stalin began the process, it is 
far from certain that Russia's defence industries can cope with the 
demands of matching Western models at a cost-effective price.

At a well-flagged meeting of the Russian Security Council, Putin blasted ministers for failing to draw up plans to meet his targets.

Stalin: The demands made by Putin compare the modernisation programmes launched under Stalin

'I still have not received your proposals. They are simply not there,' fumed the Russian president.

'If this continues, we will never be able to make procurements on time.'

He even threatened to inject private enterprise into defence plants that have been under strict state control since Stalin's time. 

He said: 'We have to break down old 
stereotypes of the type that say only specialised state companies and 
agencies can involve themselves in defence.'

Highlighting his impatience on the 
subject, he added: 'Within short deadlines we should upgrade production 
funds and carry out technological modernisation at enterprises in the 
defence industry.'Putin admitted that Russian manufacturers had failed to keep pace over the past three decades and even acknowledged Russia may require foreign technology in order to catch up.

Potential for partnership: Putin, seen here with British Prime Minister David Cameron, has said that foreign partnerships should be considered

'Foreign partnership is possible," he said, adding it was 'not shameful' to draw on overseas experience.

'But creating plants which assemble the analogues of foreign arms and hardware using imported component parts is unacceptable,' he insisted.

Western military experts have in recent years regularly decried that lack of modern Russian firepower shown at the annual Red Square parade on May 9 marking the end of the Second World War.
