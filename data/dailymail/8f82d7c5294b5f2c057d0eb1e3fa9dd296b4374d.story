Two small planes went down in separate crashes in northern Arizona Sunday, leaving six people dead, authorities said.

One of the crashes also caused a fire that burned well over 25 acres of land.

The Yavapai County Sheriff's Office said four died when a plane crashed near Sedona.

The Federal Aviation Administration said hikers in the Bear Mountain area reported the crash and a possible fire around 3 p.m. PDT Sunday.

Smoke from a fire sparked by the crash of a single-engine plane rises over Fay Canyon, near Sedona, Arizona, on July 20, 2014

The sheriff's office says fire crews found the single-engine plane about 6 p.m. in Fay Canyon.

The Arizona Republic reported that firefighters, including helicopters and ground crews, responded.

Later, authorities said a small plane crashed in northern Arizona's Mohave County near the Utah border, killing two people.

Sgt. John T. Bottoms of the Arizona Department of Public Safety told Salt Lake City's KSL-TV that the crash occurred about 6:30 PDT.

The FAA says that the plane went down 'under unknown circumstances' and was on fire.

The Fay Canyon Trailhead is closed, the National Forest said, because of the fire, which is slowly moving both north and west

Fay is a shady canyon with a stone arch and a diverse collection of plant life, known for its wildflowers

Bottoms said that crews hiked to reach the plane, which was on a ledge, and used water backpacks to extinguish the blaze.

There was no word Sunday on the identities of any of the dead or the causes of the crashes.

The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate both crashes.
