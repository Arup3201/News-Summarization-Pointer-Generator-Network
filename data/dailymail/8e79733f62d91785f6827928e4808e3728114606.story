Standing in tranquil gardens and orchards, Anne Hathaway’s cottage provided an idyllic setting for William Shakespeare to court his future wife.

But a tempest is brewing around the 16th century thatched farmhouse after developers were given permission to build up to 800 homes, a 1.3-mile road, school, shops, business units and a health centre on land as close as  238 yards to the immaculately preserved tourist attraction and its grounds.

The Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, which owns the historic cottage, yesterday said it was ‘extremely disappointed’ with the decision by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles to rubber-stamp the plans, which it said would do ‘irreversible harm’ to the setting of the property.

The local MP, Nadhim Zahawi, went further, warning MPs during  a debate on the decision that the future of a house that had survived ‘the English Reformation, the English Civil War and even 13 years of Labour’ may now have been jeopardised by the ‘careless stroke of a planning inspector’s pen’.

The proposed development at the hamlet of Shottery – a mile from Shakespeare’s birthplace of Stratford-upon-Avon – had originally been thrown out by the local council last year.

Builder Bloor Homes appealed against the decision and the Secretary of State last month upheld a planning inspector’s recommendation to allow the appeal.

Mr Pickles approved it on the basis it met a ‘significant’ need for housing, provided new local facilities and said the relief road would provide ‘modest’ transport benefits. In an impassioned speech on Tuesday, Mr Zahawi told MPs the decision ‘grants permission for a village-sized development to be welded to the side of this vitally important historic town, building a new link road directly behind the cottage in which William Shakespeare’s wife grew up’.

He said Hathaway was ‘an integral part of Shakespeare’s story which is in itself an integral part of the story of this island, our culture and our language’.

Stratford-upon-Avon Tory MP Nadhim Zahawi has blasted the ruling and accused Mr Pickles of defying the will of Parliament

The nearest new home on the two-site 
development will be 238 yards from the Hathaway family home, while the 
1.3-mile relief road crucial to the scheme passes 268 yards from the 
cottage where it is said Shakespeare wooed his bride-to-be. According to
records, they married in 1582.  

There remains one glimmer of light for residents opposed to the scheme.

The planned road runs through land owned by the SBT, which is yet to decide whether to sell.

A spokesman for Bloor said a 
compulsory purchase order was an ‘avenue’ the builder may investigate if
the trust refused to sell.
