Two Indian politicians have seen their street-cleaning publicity stunt spectacularly backfire, after pictures emerged of their own aides scattering rubbish on the streets.

Just minutes before Shazia Ilmi and Satish Upadhyay from India's BJP party were photographed sweeping the streets of New Delhi, their flunkies were  providing them with the mess to clear up.

Photos have emerged showing the aides  dumping bags and bins of garbage on the pavement and then spreading it out.

It appears they were creating the perfect situation for the politicians to publicise the government's cleaning offensive, the Indian Express reported.

BJP leader Satish Upadhayay and Shazia Ilmi both armed themselves with brooms to take part in the cleaning outside the India Islamic Centre in the country's capital city.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Swachh Bharat national cleanliness campaign on October 2 this year by grabbing a broom and cleaning the road himself.

According to the Times of India, it is the country's biggest ever cleanliness drive and at least three million central government employees will be working nationwide on the campaign. 

The prime minister has set the ambitious target of complete sanitation in the next five years, which includes getting rid of open defecation and improved management of both solid and liquid waste.
