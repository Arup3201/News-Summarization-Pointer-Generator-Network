A former NFL star has filed a suit against the state of California for not executing the man who murdered his mother, sister and two nephews 30 years ago.

Kermit Alexander, the San Francisco 49ers defensive back who was known for his aggressive play on the field, is about to get aggressive in the courtroom as a Superior Court judge has ruled he does have standing to bring forward a suit demanding that California put in place a protocol to end the life of the man who killed his family.

That man, Tiequon Cox, not only knew Alexander, but the former NFL star coached him in Pop Warner football.

Kermit Alexander, a former defensive back for the San Francisco 49ers, lost his mother, sister and two nephews when they were murdered in 1984

'It galls me,' Alexander told NBC News. 

'The people of California have said over and over again that they want this kind of punishment for the worst criminals.'

He then added; 'I don't like people getting in the way of the rule of law.' 

Tiequon Cox (above), a gang member who Alexander coached in youth football, was found guilty of the murders and sentenced to death in 1986

This case comes at a time when California has 750 inmates on death row, more than any other state in the country. Almost all of their cases are being held up as a result of strong political opposition and ongoing litigation.

In fact, since the state approved the death penalty in 1978, only 13 inmates were executed before a judge halted lethal injections, citing the excruciating pain they chemicals caused.

This does not matter to Alexander though, a man who worked hard to change his situation after being born one of 11 children to Ebora Alexander of Watts, California.

After a successful career, he had come back to Watts, which had become a violent area, and created a youth football program to get kids off the street.

That is when he first encountered Cox, who he saw as an angry young man, much like Alexander himself was at that age.

Years later, Cox was found guilty of walking into the home of Mrs. Alexander and shooting her as she sat at the kitchen table, drinking coffee in her nightgown.

From there he shot 23-year-old Dietra in the eyes as she sat up in her bed, and Mrs. Alexander's two grandchildren,  8-year-old Damon Bonner and 10-year-old Damani Garner, as they were asleep in their beds.

He was sentenced to death in 1986.

Alexander points out that it is not that he wants to see Cox put to death for what he did so much as he wants the man who murdered his family to be punished in the way a jury determined.

'It's not about the revenge,' he said. 

'It's about the law.' 

Kermit Alexander played ten seasons in the NFL - mostly for the San Francisco 49ers. He retired from the league in 1973

The state of California has not executed Cox yet so Alexander has filed a lawsuit asking them to put in place a protocol for when his life will end

Alexander says it has nothing to do with revenge, he just wants the law to be carried out

There are 750 people on death row in California, more than any other state, and no one has been put to death since 2006
