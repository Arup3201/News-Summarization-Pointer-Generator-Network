Few dare to mess with Freya, the Chancellor’s cat with an impressive reputation for mouse-catching.

She has gained the upper hand in a dawn catfight with his neighbour Larry, the Prime Minister’s cat who is better known for ‘chillaxing’.

But it appears the latest addition to George Osborne’s menagerie at Number 11 might be winning a new power struggle at Downing Street.

'Showdown on Downing Street': Freya the cat stands her ground against new addition Lola

Over the weekend, the Chancellor posted a photograph which he had taken of Lola, his new puppy, and Freya, his old moggy, on Twitter.

The caption read simply: ‘Showdown at Downing Street.’

While Freya cowers under the table, Lola - a Bichon Frise puppy who is only a few months old - is looking on inquisitively.

Last night, Downing Street insiders insisted the pair are good friends despite the traditionally dysfunctional relationship between cats and dogs.

He insisted: ‘Freya is not aggressive. She is lovely. She is just a bit more efficient than Larry when it comes to mouse-catching.’

Mr Osborne also has a budgie called Gibson, named after Guy Gibson, who led 617 Squadron on the Dam Busters raid, and two goldfish, whose names are not known.

Freya has emerged from a troubled past.

She was bought by the Chancellor and his wife, Frances, for their two children in 2009, initially living with them at their home in Notting Hill, west London.

She went missing, but was eventually returned after being found by a former neighbour who was helped by a microchip under the cat’s skin carrying Mrs Osborne’s phone number.

But in Downing street suspicion was rife that Freya may have been carrying other electronic devices in order to infiltrate the heart of government and the Treasury.

A Tory source said at the time ‘Some of us think the Chinese got her. She can get everywhere.

‘You’d only have to bug her and you could find out half the Government’s secrets.’

Lola is believed to be the first dog to inhabit Downing Street since Harold Wilson was prime minister in the 1960s and brought his yellow labrador Paddy with him.

The stand off comes as David Cameron was feeling the strain as he pounded the streets of Westminster in his jogging gear.

He tries to go for a twice-weekly jog in the parks near Downing Street, at ‘strange times of the day’ so as not to attract attention.

The Prime Minister said in a radio interview last week he was never recognised by tourists who thought he was just another ‘middle aged slightly overweight man’ as he trotted past.

Despite his regular runs, he has admitted his age is starting to ‘creep up on him’ when it comes to more strenuous exercise.

He has not followed in the footsteps of Nick Clegg, who recently told how he had taken up kickboxing to keep his weight down.
