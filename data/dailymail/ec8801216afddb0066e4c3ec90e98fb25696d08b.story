Tens of thousands of children in England are still being taught in failing secondary schools, according to official figures today.

Around 117,000 children are languishing in schools that do not reach Government exam targets.

League tables show that fewer than four in 10 pupils - in around 150 state schools - get at least five GCSEs at grade C or higher, including English and maths.

Pupils at England’s worst performing schools are leaving with average grades of D or E in their final exams.

A total of 261 state schools in England registered average GCSE grades no higher than a C- last summer, it emerged.

The number of failing schools in England has dropped by quarter of a million in four years

For the first time, the Department for 
Education published new data showing pupils’ performance in their 
best eight subjects. The figures – an average grade achieved in 
GCSEs sat last summer – will become the Government’s standard measure of
 school performance in the future.It emerged that the average pupil scored a good C grade – marked as a C+ in the tables – in the 2013 exams.

There are still 117,000 children in failing schools in England, according to the latest official figures

The latest data also shows a worrying number of girls and boys not getting two A grades and a B in subjects favoured, and often required, by Russell Group universities, considered among the best institutions in the UK.

At around 420 schools and colleges, no A-level student scored at least two A grades and a B in these subjects.

Figures also show that 84,000 children – almost half – who were considered among the brightest pupils at the age of 11 failed to go on to gain good GCSEs in all five EBacc subjects aged 16.

The Department for Education warned that schools below the standard expected, and with a history of under-performance, ‘face being taken over by a sponsor with a track record of improving weak schools’.

Praise: Education Secretary Michael Gove said that the figures were 'a credit to the professionalism and hard work of teachers'

This effectively means being closed or converted into independent academies under new leadership as part of a Coalition plan to raise standards.

This year’s top school for GCSEs was Colyton Grammar School in Devon.

The co-educational school gained the best results in the country for the second year running. It entered 120 pupils for GCSEs and equivalent exams with all gaining at least five qualifications at grade C or higher.

The most improved school in England was St Thomas More Catholic School in north London.

Its GCSE results have risen from less than a third (31%) of pupils reaching the target of five or more A*-C grades , including English and maths, in 2010 to more than nine in 10 (91%) achieving this benchmark in 2013 - a 60% improvement.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said the results were proof that Coalition reforms were starting to produce great effects.

He said improvements had been made despite the imposition of tougher exam targets for schools and a drive to push more pupils onto rigorous academic disciplines that will 'help them find a good job or go on to university'.

In all, more than a third of pupils took GCSEs in so-called 'English Baccalaureate' subjects – English, maths, science, foreign languages and history or geography – last summer compared with less than a quarter 12 months earlier.

But the data also fuelled fears that large numbers of pupils are still consigned to a substandard education.

To gain the EBacc, pupils must score at least a C at GCSE in English, maths, science, history or geography and a foreign language.

A DfE analysis of the data found that this year, 202,000 pupils were entered for the EBacc, compared with 130,000 in 2012.

In 735 secondaries, more than half of pupils were entered for the EBacc, and in 237 secondaries more than 50 per cent of students achieved the EBacc.

Rise: More secondary school pupils than ever are taking the English Baccalaureate, figures released today also revealed

Mr Gove said that the figures were 'a credit to the professionalism and hard work of teachers'.

'Thanks to their efforts, the number of children taught in under-performing schools has fallen by almost 250,000 since 2010,' he said.

'This progress has been achieved at the same time as our EBacc has ensured many more young people are taking the core subjects which will most help them find a good job or go on to university.'

Simon Burgess, director of the Centre for Market and Public Organisation and professor of economics at University of Bristol said: 'Performance tables are an important part of the school accountability system in England.

'Our research has shown that league tables play an important role in school standards.'
