The killing of 69 innocent people at a summer camp on the remote Norwegian island of Utoya by the right-wing fanatic Anders Breivik horrified the world over.

But two survivors of the island massacre, who met as they swam from their lives, have been helping eachother recover from the ordeal - and fallen in love.

Sofie Tommeras Lyshagen, 19, and Hakon Knudsen, 20, fled together as gunman Breivik slaughtered his victims with an assault rifle.

Brave: The young couple hope news of their romance will bring joy and show they have not been broken by the ordeal on Utoya island, pictured shortly after the massacre last July

The pair only managed to survive the ordeal last July by swimming away from the island and hiding from Breivik.

But as the students comforted eachother over the horrific scenes they witnessed that day they found that they had made more than just a close friend. 

Sofie, whose ex-boyfriend and best friend were both shot dead at the youth camp on the isle of Utoya, spotted Hakon swimming after she had been shot at.

'Evil': Anders Behring Breivik smiles as he arrives in court in Oslo charged with killing a total of  77 people in twin attacks in Norway last July

She told the Sun newspaper: 'We exchanged a few words and were both quite hysterical. But we have been together ever since.

'It was only later when we were safe in the countryside that the romance began. We felt the chemistry was good and that we understood and could help each other.

'This hasnâ€™t broken us. We hope to spread a little joy through this â€” our love.'

She added that she hopes Breivik, who goes on trial next week accused of mass murder, realises the 'evil he has done to others' but added she still didn't think he comprehended impact of his actions today.

Before his attack on Utoya island, Breivik set off a car bomb outside government buildings in Oslo, killing eight people on July 22 last year.

He then travelled 25 miles northwest of Oslo, to the summer camp and, dressed as a police officer, spent more than an hour killing a further 69 people.

It is expected that Breivik will spend the rest of his life on a psychiatric ward - a fate the gunman described as 'worse than death' in a letter released this week.

The 33-year-old wrote: 'To send a political activist to an asylum is more sadistic and more evil than killing him! It is a fate worse than death.'

Plea: Breivik said in his letter that to be found criminally insane would be the 'ultimate humiliation'

Anders Breivik will use his trial to challenge a diagnosis 
that he is criminally insane, something that would be 'worse than 
death', excerpts of a letter he wrote showed on Wednesday.     

The trial of the far-right fanatic, 
who gunned down 69 at a Labour Party youth camp after detonating a car 
bomb in central Oslo that killed eight, starts in Oslo on April 
16.         

In November two court-appointed 
psychiatrists deemed the 33-year-old was psychotic and paranoid 
schizophrenic at the time of the attacks, which would normally mean he 
could not be sentenced to prison.             

In a 38-page letter he wrote in jail 
and sent to various Norwegian media - of which extracts were published 
in the daily VG on Wednesday - Breivik said that being deemed criminally
 insane was unbearable to him.

'I must admit this is the worst thing that could have happened to me as it is the ultimate humiliation,' he wrote.             

'To send a political activist to a 
mental hospital is more sadistic and evil than to kill him! It is a fate
 worse than death.'   

Breivik has said he committed the 
attacks on July 22 last year to protect Norway from multiculturalism. 
They were the worst outbreak of violence there since the end of World 
War Two.             

'I knew of course what was right and what was wrong, but I acted instinctively,' Breivik wrote in the letter.       

He criticised the two psychiatrists, Torgeir Husby and Synne Soerheim, as unable to be objective.

'Husby said on several occasions that 
what I had done was bestial and I got the impression from him that he 
saw me as a wild animal that had to be locked in and drugged at whatever
 cost.'

'Has an event that has traumatised a 
nation also traumatised Husby and Soerheim to such an extent that they 
must be regarded as having a conflict of interest? Can two 
court-appointed psychiatrists that are so emotionally affected by July 
22 mean that they are not able to be objective?'             

After a public outcry following the 
publication of the first psychiatric report, the judges in the case have
 asked for another evaluation of Breivik's mental health by different 
experts. That is due to be published on Tuesday.
