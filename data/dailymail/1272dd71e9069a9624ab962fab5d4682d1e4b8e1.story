Turning on the out-of-office email response before going on holiday is often the final ceremonial step in the build-up to a break, yet even on the beach a pinging inbox is difficult to ignore.

Now, one of the world's biggest car manufacturers has gone one step further to ensure its employees can truly switch off – by automatically deleting any emails that land in their inboxes.

Daimler, the German car manufacturer, has guaranteed its 100,000 staff members a blissed-out break as they can now choose to have all their new emails deleted while they are away.

Those who send an email to the vacationing employee are notified by a 'Mail on Holiday' message that the email has not been received, and are invited to contact a nominated substitute instead.

'Our employees should relax on holiday and not read work-related emails,' Daimler board member Wilfried Porth told the Financial Times.

'With 'Mail on Holiday' they start back after the holidays with a clean desk. There is no traffic jam in their inbox. That is an emotional relief.' Daimler said its employees are free to decide whether they wish to use the 'Mail on Holiday' system, but assured staff it would not record who had done so.

For many who receive hundreds, if not thousands of emails in the space of a few days, the prospect of returning from a break to an empty inbox is tantalising, but it raises questions of office etiquette and being branded work-shy.

While it may not catch on so quickly in Britain, the German government has has pushed for initiatives to improve work-life balance, and its labour ministry has told managers to stop emailing or calling staff out-of-hours except in an emergency.

Managers at Deutsche Telekom also agreed to stop sending emails to staff during the evenings, weekends and holidays, while in 2011 Volkswagen announced that company servers would stop routing emails to employee BlackBerrys during the evenings.

The trend comes as more than half of office staff admit to checking their their emails while on a break abroad, according to a survey from online travel agent Travel Republic It found that 52 per cent will log in for work when they should officially be chilling out and 26 per cent of those said they would respond to emails.

Women were also more relaxed than men during their time off, with 54 per cent saying they never looked at work emails, compared with 42 per cent of men.

Reading work emails had caused 36 per cent of couples to fall out and 70 per cent of women confessed to having a problem with their other halves checking their emails on holiday compared with 58 per cent of men who saw it as an issue.

Researchers, who quizzed 1,000 UK-based office workers, found that younger employees were the most conscientious, with 38 per cent of them claiming to read and respond to emails when they are away, compared with 29 per cent of those aged 45-54.

Among those aged between 35-44, 45 per cent said they let their out-of-office message do what it's intended for and never checked their emails.

Travel Republic's chief marketing officer Elliott Pritchard said most people felt relief when they took a break from work, but added: 'We initially wanted to understand the emotions people experience when preparing to leave the office for annual leave, and the biggest emotion is relief (46 per cent).

'As workplaces become busier, annual leave becomes more of a luxury, but the reality is that many office workers cannot completely turn off.'
