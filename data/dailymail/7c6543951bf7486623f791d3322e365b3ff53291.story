A police officer has been ordered to get rid of his noisy cockerel after it enraged neighbours with its early morning wake-up calls. 

Police officer Geraint Rees lives with his wife Cerys and children Seren, aged six, and Taran, aged four, near Pontypridd, in South Wales, where their garden is full of fruit and vegetable patches, several hens, two rabbits and their cockerel Bomper. 

But since the bird began to crow just over a year ago, PC Rees has received a number of letters from the council with the most recent saying he must get rid of the cockerel or he could face prosecution.

The police officer has been ordered to get rid of his noisy cockerel after enraging neighbours in  with his early morning wake-up calls in in Church Village, near Pontypridd, South Wales

The family was first made aware of the complaints last year after somebody told the council the cockerel had woken them up at 4.30am.

Most councils advise cockerel owners that they are at risk of falling foul of noise officials.

Following this, PC Rees built a breezeblock house to keep the bird in overnight to stifle the noise, but despite this working for a while, the Rhondda Cynon Taf council got back in touch earlier this year and then issued him with a noise abatement notice in June.

PC Rees said: 'Having Bomper and the other animals is a great way to teach our children about nature and where food comes from.

'We've even taken Bomper to the local primary school to teach the children about farm animals - it's heartbreaking to think we could lose him.

'It was purely by accident that we got Bomper. We were sold chicks, which we thought would grow up into hens, but one grew into a cockerel.

'It's heartbreaking for our children to think they could lose him, and we were also hoping to breed him in the future.'

The police officer has now launched a Facebook group called 'Save the Church Village Cockerel' to try and keep Bomper.

He said: 'Because I didn't get rid of the cockerel within 14 days of the notice, the council has now said it's in the process of completing a prosecution file, which could take me to court.

'I feel the goalposts have been moved however because originally we were told the cockerel noise was keeping people awake in the early hours and following all the work and expense we've gone to in order to rectify the problem, the council is now saying the noise is a nuisance all day long.

'Bomper is our pet and we really don't want to give him away – we'll fight this to the end.'

A Rhondda Cynon Taf council spokesman said: 'We are investigating complaints in relation to noise pollution.

'No charges have been brought at this time and the case remains very much ongoing.'

This is not the first time residents have complained about noisy animals waking them up in the early hours. 

In April this year, chicken breeder Helen Rogers, 57, was summoned to Fareham Magistrates' Court accused of breaching a noise abatement notice on three occasions.  

Villagers in Hambledon, in the South Downs National Park in Hampshire, said her cockerel woke them at 3am and went on 'incessantly' until 11pm, starting a chain reaction of crowing.
