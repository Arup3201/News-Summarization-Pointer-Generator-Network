A British couple today told a court of the terrifying moment they watched a madman hacking off a woman's head in a Tenerife shop.

Holidaymakers Kenneth and Susan Bennison said they were just six feet away when a deranged drug addict decapitated Jennifer Mills-Westley, 60, with a nine-inch knife.

Mrs Bennison told a jury Deyan Deyanov, 29, looked 'unclean, wild and not human-looking' while repeatedly stabbing the grandmother-of-five in the neck.

Evidence: A British couple told the court how Deyan Deyanov beheading 60-year-old Jennifer Mills-Westley with a nine-inch ham-slicing knife

Breaking down in tears, she said: 'We were in the aisle of the shop and we heard a very strange noise.

'When I turned to see what the noise was we saw a lady on the ground with him at the back of her with a knife in her.

Victim: British grandmother Jennifer Mills-Westley was beheaded in Los Cristianos on May 13 2011

'She was very near to me. He was knelt on the ground with the knife in her head. I could see the knife.

'He was stabbing her in the neck.' 
Asked by prosecutor Angel Garcia Rodriguez if she had seen the 
attacker's face, Mrs Bennison replied: 'Yes. He looked unclean, wild, 
not human-looking. He didn't look human.

'We thought to see if we could help and then we just ran away.

'It was all over in seconds.' Mrs 
Mills-Westley's daughter Samantha Mills-Westley, 39, wiped away tears 
with a tissue while listening to the evidence from the public gallery.

Her sister Sarah Mills-Westley, 43, 
watched in silence as Mr and Mrs Bennison, from Warrington, Cheshire, 
gave evidence to the trial in Santa Cruz, Tenerife, by video link from 
the UK.

Describing the horrific attack, Mr Bennison said: 'There was no argument, nothing was said between them.

'We passed her in the same shopping aisle and then saw him on her, stabbing her with a knife.

'We heard her gasp for breath.

'He withdrew the knife out of the neck and then put it back in again.

Daughter: Samantha Mills listens to the terrifying account of how her mother was brutally beheaded

Grief: Jennifer Mills-Westley's brother John Smith breaks down shortly after arriving at court today

Brother: John Smith, the brother of Jennifer Mills-Westley arrives at court today with his wife Julie

Business as usual: The shop where Mrs Mills-Westley was attacked was trading again less than 24 hours after the killing

Amateur footage: After watching the CCTV footage, Deyanov 
said it was 'a montage, a film' and claimed that he did not recognise 
himself in the images

Jennifer Mills-Westley was described by her family as someone who was 'full of life, generous of heart and would do anything for anyone'.

The 60-year-old was a mother of two daughters - Sarah and Sam - and grandmother of five who was living life to the full in the 'eternal spring' of the Canary Islands.

Originally from Norwich, Norfolk, she had worked as a road safety officer with Norfolk County Council.In that role, Ms Mills-Westley taught schoolchildren cycling safety training and she was described by colleagues as 'popular and well-respected'.

She had retired and settled in Tenerife, where she owned two apartments in the Port Royale complex on the hillside edge of Los Cristianos.

One two-bedroom flat was rented out while she lived in the other and had been resident there for at least 10 years.

Neighbours described her as 'quiet and peaceful and always immaculately dressed'.

With one of her daughters living in France and the other in Norwich, she enjoyed travelling to pay visits to her family.

In a poignant tribute following her death, her ex-husband Peter told The Mail on Sunday she was a 'wonderful woman, a brilliant mother and I loved her dearly.'

That's when I got my wife out of the building.

'I wanted to help her but when I saw the knife coming out of her neck I knew we could do nothing.

'I saw his face, he looked calm, a 
bit wild appearance but apart from that calm.' Mrs Mills-Westley, a 
retired road safety officer from Norwich, was killed on Friday 13 May 
2011 in the resort of Los Cristianos on the Spanish holiday island, 
where she had an apartment.

Prosecutors want homeless Bulgarian Deyanov locked up for 20 years for murder.

There was an outburst in court as 
Deyanov yelled out 'I am Jesus Christ' in Bulgarian while a police 
officer was giving evidence.

Handcuffed and flanked by two armed 
police officers, Deyanov, wearing a beige jumper, black tracksuit 
bottoms and white trainers, twitched repeatedly while the evidence was 
heard.

A Chinese shopkeeper, Yiping Chen, 
told the court she saw Deyanov with a knife in one hand and Mrs 
Mills-Westley's severed head in the other.

She said Deyanov told her: 'I've cut 
the head off a crazy girl. I've cut the head off a crazy girl.' Deyanov,
covered in blood, then put down the knife, used for cutting Spanish 
ham, and ran out of the shop with the head in his hands, it was said.

He was overpowered outside by a security guard and passers-by.

Outside a baying mob gathered, shouting 'Murderer! Kill him! Hang him!', the court heard.

A police officer, who was not named in court, said: 'People were shouting 'there's a head, there's a head'.

'On the kerb opposite there was a head covered by a blanket.

'I followed a trail of blood into the
shop. Inside there was a body in a pool of blood, missing its head.' 
Another officer said Deyanov was repeating the same phrase over and over
in Bulgarian.

The officer said: 'He was very disturbed. He wasn't behaving like a normal person.

'He looked like he was out of it.' 
The court heard Deyanov had been apprehended by police twice for acts of
violence in the fortnight before the gruesome murder.

Once he was stopped for throwing glass beer bottles at a shopping centre in Los Cristianos.

The other time he was held after having a fight with a man in the nearby resort of Playa de las Americas.

On trial: The defendant said he had been using crack cocaine and LSD before his arrest, but had no memory of living in Tenerife

Drug-addled drifter: Deyanov was a drifter who had lived in Tenerife and Wales where in 2010 he was sectioned under the mental health act

On Monday Deyanov, a paranoid schizophrenic, told the court he heard voices in his head ordering him to kill and fight.

He said he was told he was 'an angel 
of Jesus Christ sent to create a new Jerusalem.' Deyanov claimed 
security camera footage from the shop, played to the jury of nine, was a
'montage, a movie.' He said he regularly took crack cocaine and LSD and
could not recall living in Tenerife.

Deyanov's defence lawyer Francisco Beltran said the Bulgarian 'needs help, not punishment' and called for him to be acquitted.

Deyanov, who denies murder, had 
previously lived in Edinburgh and Wales, where he was sectioned in 2010 
under the Mental Health Act at Glan Clwyd Hospital.

The trial at the Provincial Court in Santa Cruz continues.
