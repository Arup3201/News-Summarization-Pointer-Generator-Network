Penny Mellor, 53, (pictured arriving at Chelmsford Crown Court today) is accused of sending abuse online to anti-paedophile campaigner Shy Keenan

An anti-paedophile campaigner was bombarded with online messages claiming she lied in her bestselling misery memoir by a woman who had developed an 'obsession' with her, a court heard.

Penny Mellor, 53, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, allegedly attacked Shy Keenan through Twitter, emails and a blog, claiming she had fabricated an account of childhood sexual abuse.

Ms Keenan, from Colchester, Essex, who describes herself as a justice campaigner, wrote a book in 2008 called Broken, where she told of the abuse she suffered at the hands of her stepfather.

The revelation led to the conviction of Stanley Claridge and others in 2002 and Ms Keenan set up her own organisation, Phoenix Post, with campaigner Sara Payne, whose daughter was murdered.

She also worked as a columnist for the Sun and revealed her early life on a BBC Newsnight programme.

Chelmsford Crown Court heard that Mellor accused Ms Keenan of repeatedly lying in her book, claiming she was a fraudster and an attention seeker. 

Mellor denies stalking Ms Keenan and causing her serious alarm or distress between January 1 and 16 March 2013 by sending tweets, publishing statements about her in emails sent to work associates and carrying out a course of conduct which had a substantial effect on Ms Keenan's day to day activities.

Prosecutor Tony Abell, opening the case to the jury, said the law against cyber stalking via social media under which Mellor was being tried only came into effect in January 2013.

He said Mellor appeared 'to have developed something of an obsession with Shy Keenan and embarked upon a very personal campaign against her'.

He said the tweets were personal and offensive and continued: 'She has accused her repeatedly of lying in the book "Broken".

'She has suggested Ms Keenan has groomed individuals, implied that she suffers from Munchausen's By Proxy and referred to her post traumatic stress disorder.

'Emails contain private information which Shy Keenan regards as sensitive, including copies of marriage certificates, addresses and the like.'

Mr Abell said Ms Keenan felt concerned about her own and her family's personal safety because the information might help other people with grudges against her. 

She had installed extra security and had had to go back on anti-depressants.

The jury heard  Mellor was a campaigner against false allegations of Munchausen by Proxy, where parents were the victims of false claims from their own children, for organisation Dare to Care.

In 1998 to 1999, Mellor and Ms Keenan were in close communication but they fell out. Ms Keenan thought that Mellor's work might be offering support to real child abusers.

The two women didn't have any contact again until late 2012.

Mr Abell said the trigger was Ms Keenan writing in her Sun column in October 2012, following the Jimmy Savile scandal, that she had mentioned to Esther Rantzen many years before of rumours about his inappropriate behaviour.

Mellor then began tweeting that Ms Keenan 'had told lies in her book Broken', said the prosecutor.

Mellor emailed recipients including the BBC, Newsnight, the Sun, the Guardian, Broken's publisher Hodder & Stoughton and Ms Keenan's literary agent.

She was appealing to them to 'investigate' her claims of inaccuracies in Broken and sent 239 tweets from January to March 2013.

Mellor is to have accused Ms Keenan of 'lying and cheating for years' and that she 'cons everyone and hides behind that abuse'.

The court heard she described the graphic abuse Ms Keenan wrote about in her book as 'titillation' for paedophiles and not the sort of thing a mother should publish for her own children to read.

Mellor wrote that Ms Keenan 'seeks attention, she needs to be adored and revered in order to get money', the jury was told.

'That's a flavour of the sort of bile which was coming out of Penny Mellor over this period,' said Mr Abell. '

It sought to attack Ms Keenan's credibility as a victim of sexual abuse, causing her distress and concern by revealing personal information.

Mellor was given a verbal warning by Essex Police in December 2012 but after a brief respite, the cyber attacks began again in January.

She was arrested on 15 March 2013 and told police her motive was to get Ms Keenan to stop what she was doing.

The trial, which is expected to last about two weeks, continues.
