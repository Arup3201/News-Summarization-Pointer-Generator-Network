Kara Alongi tweeted a fake home invasion and a violent abduction. The 16-year-old's Twitter message - 'There is someone in my hour ecall (sic) 911' - was shared by almost 34,000 people and the #HelpFindKara campaign gathered attention worldwide.

A full-scale search was put into operation by New Jersey police, including large amounts of expensive overtime. But as authorities investigated it became obvious that the story didn't add up. Then Kara was found unharmed two days later and safely returned to her parents.

Officials have never put a final figure on how much the operation to find Alongi cost them, and the taxpayer. But today Clark Township announced that the police bill incurred by Kara's hoax will not be passed onto her family.

'Kidnap': A huge worldwide campaign went into operation to find Kara Alongi. Police have now decided that her family won't face the bills for her search

Found: Kara Alongi, 16, was picked up by officials on a highway after being caught on CCTV at the NJ Transit Station in Rahway

Clark mayor Sal Bonaccorso told The Star-Ledger that the bill was not 'exorbitant' and he didn't want to burden Kara's parents.

'We're not going to sit there and pass 
the costs along,' Bonaccorso said.'Obviously this young lady had some 
things going on, however you want to say it. We're just happy she was 
returned to her family and we hope she makes some better choices in the 
future.'

Alongi gained hundreds of followers 
after asking people on Twitter to call 911 that first Sunday. However, all evidence pointed toward the teen being an apparent runaway.

Surveillance video showed her at the 
Rahway train station purchasing a ticket to New York City on Sunday 
after the tweet was sent.

Then Clark Police Chief Alan Scherb said state troopers spotted 16-year-old Kara Alongi walking along the New Jersey Turnpike near Interchange 1 in Carneys Point around 4.30pm Tuesday October 2.

She was taken to a hospital for evaluation and returned home early Wednesday.

Disappeared: Police traced a phone call placed from her house to a local cab company around the same time as the Tweet, and the cab driver identified her as the girl he picked up

The high school student posted
a misspelled message to her Twitter page around 6.20pm Sunday night 
that gave the impression that she was in a panic, stating: 'There is 
someone in my hour ecall 911'.

Her Twitter followers did not call the 
authorities, but her parents did once they returned to the family home 
in Clark, New Jersey, and realized that the girl was missing.

But
the teenager was spotted on CCTV holding a backpack and a 
large purse while waiting for a train at the NJ Transit station in 
Rahway.

The 16-year-old's lone tweet that 
appeared to be a desperate plea for help went viral with hundreds of 
Twitter messages posted hoping for a her safe return.

Clark police confirmed Sunday night 
that the girl's initial tweet was a hoax and there were no signs of foul
play in Alongi's home.

At the time of her disappearance, her family were watching her younger brother's sporting event.

Police
brought a canine unit to the home and, according to their press 
release, the dogs 'tracked Kara's scent from the back door of the house,
through a neighbor's yard and then to the sidewalk and around the 
corner back onto her block where the scent goes cold.'

Gone: The taxi driver took her to the nearby Rahway train station which has regular services to Manhattan

After initially believing the Tweet, police became suspicious because there were no signs of foul play or abduction.

The
biggest sign, however, that something was amiss came from phone records
that showed someone in the Alongi's home called a local taxi company 
and ordered a pick up at their address right around the time that Kara 
posted the intruder claim to Twitter.

'The investigation quickly revealed a number of inconsistencies in the teen's statement,' the police statement reveals.

The local Patch site
reports that police got in touch with the taxi driver who picked up the
request, and the man identified Kara as the girl he drove to the nearby
Rahway train station.Â 

The train station serves the Northeast Corridor line and the North Jersey Coast line, both of which have their northern-most stop in Manhattan.

'Kara might feel that she will be in trouble if she comes home after this scare and causing a panic. At this point all everyone cares about is seeing her safe and at her house where she belongs,' the police statement concluded.
