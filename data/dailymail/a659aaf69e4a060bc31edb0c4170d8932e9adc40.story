Schools should stop wasting money on new iPads and other 'shiny gadgets' for pupils and instead spend the cash on hiring 8,000 new teachers, the leader of Britain's largest headteachers' organisation claims.

Russell Hobby, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), has questioned whether spending millions on computers and tablet devices can be 'justified at a time of austerity'.

According to recent figures by the British Educational Suppliers Association (BESA), approximately a quarter of a billion pounds is spent every year on computers in schools.

In a personal blog post to be published today, Mr Hobby said: 'I think we'd be better spending money on recruiting and training great teachers and sticking them in front of old-fashioned blackboards.'

He said the money currently spent on technology in schools was enough to hire 8,000 new teachers or build 40 new secondary schools.

In his blog post, seen by the Independent, he also revealed he was 'dubious' about using technology in non-IT lessons.

He said: 'It is early days, of course, but an animated presentation on an electronic whiteboard or a lesson plan on an iPad are not transformative in terms of standards.

'Nice, perhaps, time-saving, maybe, but remember the cost.'  

His comments come as new figures reveal that the amount of money spent on technology by schools hit a new record in 2014.

The research, by BESA, was gathered from 1,238 schools across the UK – including 731 primary schools and 507 secondary schools – and suggests that spending on software, hardware and technical support will top £14,000 in each primary school and more than £65,000 in each secondary school.

Louis Coiffait, of NAHT Edge – part of the association which helps further the career of headteachers – also questioned the need for expensive gadgets, such as iPads, in schools.

In a separate blog post, he wrote: ‘Billions of pounds is being made by private investors and companies out of education hardware and software.

‘Yes we need more data and evidence about what helps learning and what’s good value for money, but you can’t measure everything that matters. Above anything else, when it comes to education technology what we really need is the engagement, judgement and leadership of skilled and confident teachers.

‘Schools need to be able to decide which tools are best for their students, and support and develop their staff to use and test them. There’s no silver bullet, no revolution and no killer app.

‘Education is a long-term, messy and complicated business. At the very heart of it we need really great teachers and principled leaders.

‘They need to be able to pick the best tools for the job whether that’s something new and exciting, or something old and tested.'
