Aussie blokes are renowned worldwide for their no-nonsense masculinity.

But take another very close at that spunky bloke at the bar, because his new-found confidence may be thanks to his syringe-wielding cosmetic practitioner.

As well as having his accountant, gym instructor, and barber on speed-dial it appears the modern-day Australian macho man is a closet metrosexual, suggested by the rise in injectable muscle relaxants like Botulinum toxin, otherwise known as Botox and its cousins Dysport and Xeomin.

Louise Pring, Practice Manager for Heber Davis Skin Clinic in Ultimo, Sydney, says, 'Bro-tox is on the increase as men are no longer embarrassed about calling or coming into the clinic to find out how they can  improve their looks'.

'The number of male clients has definitely risen over the past few years and anti-wrinkle injections have become our most popular treatment for men, counting for about 20% of our clients,' she said.

'In the run-up to Christmas the figure is even higher because we offer lay-by, so we have a lot of younger men who usually couldn't afford it coming in.'

When Heber Davis opened in 1988 its clients were 99% female, apart from men who were being treated for skin disorders.

But because Botox is now widely spoken about and seen as acceptable - and celebrities like Simon Cowell and David Hasselhoff, have praised its effects - Ms Pring says the stigma has been removed.

The procedure takes just a few minutes so can be performed discreetly in a lunch hour, and because it can take up to two weeks for the drug to take effect, it's not a dramatic sudden change.

'Our male clients used to have treatments like laser for pigmentation or sun damage,' Ms Pring adds. 'But nowadays men, like their female counterparts, don't want to look their age, and are proactive about doing something about it.

'Often women who attend the clinic will bring the husband in for a treatment,' she continues, 'and although there are lots of male skincare products out there, muscle relaxants are more effective and provide a quick fix with no downtime.

4) Excessive sweating

5) Reducing pore size 

When tradie Adrian Turner, 38, from Bondi, who has inherited lines across his forehead from his dad, noticed the wrinkles were getting deeper and beginning to age him, he turned to Heber Davis for help.

Doctor Debora Davis had already cured Adrian's bruxism  (teeth grinding causing headache and jaw soreness) using muscle relaxants so because he knew the staff he didn't feel so awkward asking for the 'girly' procedure.

'I was  embarrassed as it's a bit girly,' he said. 'But the lines were making me look older than 38 and I was beginning to feel really self-conscious. My female friends said it stops more wrinkles forming so I bit the bullet and made the appointment.

'I panicked initially and began to regret it in case it was really obvious but two weeks later, my lines have reduced and softened and – most importantly – I still look like me,' he said.

'If I looked like the Joker or worse my mates would never let me live it down,' he laughed. 'I've had a few people saying I look relaxed and asking if I've been on holiday but no one has twigged yet.

'I love the results and will definitely be having a top-up when it starts to wear off.'

Dr Davis, who treats a number of celebrities, says that her male customers are from all walks of life, and reels off tradies, salesmen, doctors and media-executives as the majority.

'Men see Bro-tox as an investment in their career and their life as it boosts confidence and self-esteem,' she said.

'It helps them compete with the younger competition in the work place and dating arena - if you look good, you feel good and the new-found confidence helps you perform better in all spheres of life.'

Injectables such as Botox is performed in just minutes by a registered doctor or nurse and has no downtime

In Australia the drug is always meant to be administered by a registered doctor or nurse. 

There are a number of pop-up style salons and chain clinics that offer special deals and discounts to lure new customers, so due to its affordability Louise says there are now a lot of younger people asking for treatments. 

'The trick is to look younger and fresher,' Ms Pring added, 'not older and obvious. And if it also takes the focus off a receding hairline or bad teeth, why not?'
