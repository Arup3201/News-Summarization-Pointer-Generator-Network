He earned the nickname 'Two Jags' when it emerged that he owned a Jaguar and could use another on Government business.

But Lord Prescott relied on taxis and a walking stick to help him get around London last night.

And the former deputy prime minister looked decidedly uncomfortable in the back of a cab as he and wife Pauline attended a party hosted by Sir David Frost.

Lord Prescott, 74, has been forced to wear a protective shoe after he broke a metatarsal in his right foot last month.

It is a similar injury to the one which threatened England footballer David Beckham's participation in the 2002 World Cup.

But Labour sources say the peer has remained active since the break, which is believed to have happened in an unfortunate accident at the party's Yorkshire and Humber conference in Bradford on June 9.

He was one of many famous guests at Sir David's annual summer party, held at the Royal Hospital Chelsea.

Onlookers said he had to walk through a muddy field to enter the garden party, but still managed a smile for photographers.

Stars on the guest list included actor Michael Sheen, who played Sir David in the film Frost/Nixon.

Former Arsenal and England footballer Sol Campbell and ex-Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown were also at the party.

Lord Prescott will want to be rid of the walking stick soon, for he has a potentially busy autumn of campaigning ahead.

He is the Labour candidate in the election for Humberside's first elected police commissioner, which is to be held in November.
