A retired family doctor killed himself after he wrongly convinced himself he had cancer, an inquest heard yesterday.

Dr Philip Squire, 59, was found hanged at his home where he'd left a note saying he found 'the idea of operations and long suffering just unbearable'.

But the inquest in Somerset was told how test results had given the GP the all clear and he had probably brought on the symptoms on himself physiologically.

Tragedy: Doctor Philip Squire, 59, was found hanged at his home in Taunton, Somerset (stock image pictured), where he left a note saying his cancer was too much to bear despite being given the all-clear

His own GP, Doctor William Chandler, said the medic lived alone and suffered depression. He believed Dr Squire feared cancer rather than actually suffering from it.

Neighbours found the retired GP in his home in Taunton, Somerset, where he left two notes.

One of them read: 'My last 16 months have been hell, knowing something serious is happening but not being able to convince others. I have also felt rather alone and isolated.

'The idea of operations and suffering was just unbearable.'

His niece Judith Sumner said he was 'conscientious and hard working' and retired in 2010 as senior partner because he was finding life as a GP 'very stressful' and suffered anxiety and low moods.

West Somerset coroner Michael Rose recorded a verdict of suicide at the Taunton hearing.

He said: 'Sadly he had a phobia about dying with cancer of the pancreas. Nothing could disabuse him of the fact that he felt the symptoms.

'It is a sad end for a man who has given an awful lot of his life to this town.'
