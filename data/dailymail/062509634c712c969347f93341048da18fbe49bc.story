Most people fear monster waves but not Western Australian quadriplegic Paul D'Vorak despite having no movement below his armpits.

The risks of taking on the wild surf doesn’t worry the 41-year-old former champion surfer who uses a specially-designed board.

Before his first surf at the bombie behind the Gallows break near Margaret River, others wanted to call it off due to the wind. 

But not D'Vorak who used his shoulders to take off on the first wave when he found himself in a spot of trouble.

Fearless: D'Vorak being towed out to catch the next wave

‘I was stranded in the impact zone and copped a set on the head and got bounced off the reef and washed all the way to the beach,’ he told the ABC.

However, this did not deter D’Vorak one bit.

‘I actually enjoyed the wipe-outs as much as I enjoyed catching the wave because there are a lot of sensations that I thought I'd never experience again,’ he said.

‘The first one hit me and pushed me for about 10 metres before it let me come up, he said. 

‘The second one actually bounced me off the reef and rolled me on the bottom, and it was great to experience all those sensations and feelings again.'

Being paralysed from under his armpits did not stop Paul D'Vorak (pictured being lowered in the water) from surfing again

His friend Richard Horner was on rescue duty and quickly swam over to him and they headed straight back out again.

Ironically, it was not the unpredictable ocean that paralysed the former welder seven years ago.

He was at a party standing next to a trampoline when the person who was jumping did not see him and landed on his head, breaking his neck.

Not one to turn down a challenge, the fearless surfer was not prepared to give up the sport he loves despite his serious injury.

Working with shaper Al Bean, D'Vorak has developed a wider, thicker board that lets him wedge his arms into straps and lie down.

He then lets go of a string in his mouth, which is attached to a quick release mechanism for the tow rope behind the jet ski.

No longer able to travel the world and chase the big waves – this is the next best thing for D'Vorak.

‘What we do defines who we are a bit, so to lose that and be able to get a taste of it back again was pretty special,’ he said.

D'Vorak is an incomplete quadraplegic, with limited skin sensation, but has some movement in his shoulders, biceps and left arm tricep.

He now gives talks at schools and workplaces about the dangers of spinal injury, and encouraging people to make the most of their lives.
