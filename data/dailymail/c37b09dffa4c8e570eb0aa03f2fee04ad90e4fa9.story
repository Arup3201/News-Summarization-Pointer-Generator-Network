British parents are choosing increasingly unusual names for their children - including Dior, Daiquiri, Hiya and Reem.

National records for 2014 show thousands of babies are now the only person in the country to have their name.

The trend for calling youngsters something completely unique has led to some bizarre examples, such as Godstreasure, Diamond-Leigh and Spartacus.

The number of unique names chosen last year  topped 4,800 and accounted for nearly two-thirds of the total number of names.

Those chosen for boys included Alp, Daily, Egor, Kasper, Lake, Scout and Sherlock. A boy was also called just the letter 'M' while others were named Papa and Spurgeon.

The names of footballers also proved popular with one boy being called Neymar after the Brazilian Barcelona player and others called Strachan, Pirlo and Zola.

Girls' names included Hiya, Ariel, Fox and Prayer. Eight girls were called Valentina, seven were called Crystal and five were named Monroe.

Place names also proved popular with boys called London, a girl called Camden and four girls called Paisley.

Musicians also featured with four girls called Rihanna, a boy called Presley and two girls each called Lulu and Shakira.

Responding to the announcement of names in Scotland, parenting groups said mums and dads often gave children unusual names to make them feel special, but warned some of the names could give rise to problems in later life.

Records show the trend for one-off names led to more than 4,800 unique children's names last year

Lisa Penney, of Bounty, the UK's largest parenting club, said: 'Celebrities like the Beckhams are renowned for choosing unusual names for their off-spring and today's parents are quick to follow a trend in a bid to make sure their choice of baby names stands out from the crowd.

'But baby name trends can change quickly and names that first seem unusual can quickly become common in the classroom.

'Just a couple of years ago Ava and Isla were pretty uncommon as a baby girl's name, yet now they regularly feature in the top ten.

'Likewise for boys, a decade ago the names Jacob and Noah were rarely considered, but nowadays parents look beyond previously traditional biblical names like Matthew, Luke and Adam.

'Whilst certain baby names can quickly rise to fame they can just as easily fall from favour. Take Tilly, Lexi and Lacey for example, now that they are more common in classrooms across the country they no longer make the grade for new parents who want a name that no other child is likely to have in the playground.' 

A list of the top 100 names for boys and girls was published in December, showing Jack and Emily were the most popular.
