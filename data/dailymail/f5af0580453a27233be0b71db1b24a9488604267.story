LeBron James claimed that violence is not the answer after rioters took over cities across America when it was determined that police officer Darren Wilson will not face charges related to the death of 18-year-old Micheal Brown.

The basketball superstar condemned the violent protests across the nation, saying that the rioting was hurting more people.

Members of a grand jury decided earlier this week that police officer Wilson would not face criminal charges related to the death of teenager Brown in August in Ferguson, Missouri.

Peaceful protests then spiralled out of control and president Barack Obama pleaded for calm, and now James has had his say as well. 

LeBron James condemned the violent scenes in America as a result of the Darren Wilson ruling

James called on rioters to stop hurting more families and wants the larger society issue to be addressed

Kobe Bryant called on a 'serious legal system' conversation to take place

The Cleveland Cavaliers star said: 'That (violence) is not the answer. What does that do? What does that actually do?

Just hurt more families, hurt more people, draw more attention to things that shouldn't even be going on instead of people going to the family's household and praying with them And saying, "Things are going to be great." You know, "Mike Brown is in a better place now," and "Trayvon Martin is in a better place now."

'That's where it should be. I mean, burning down things and shooting up things and running cars into places and stealing and stuff like that, what does that do? It doesn't make you happy.'

James insisted that the Brown case touched on larger problems in society that must be addressed.

'I think that news itself, the issue is much bigger than that,' he said.

'It's not just one instance. It's not just Mike Brown or Trayvon Martin or anything that's going on in our society. I think it's much bigger than that.

'Violence is not the answer and retaliation is not the solution. My prayers and best wishes goes out to the families of anyone that loses a loved one, especially a kid today.'

Five-time NBA champion Kobe Bryant called for changes to the legal system.

He said: 'We can sit here and argue about it until we're blue in the face and protest about it, but until we have a serious legal system conversation, it's going to keep on happening.'
