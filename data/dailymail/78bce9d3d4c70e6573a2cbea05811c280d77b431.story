A mother-of-four was beaten by her ex-boyfriend so badly that he left the indent of his ‘DAD’ sovereign ring on her face after the 30 minute attack. 

Gemma Ford was left with a broken nose, bruising to her neck and jaw plus two black eyes when boyfriend Richard Mullen tried to strangle her and then beat her.

When the police caught up with Mullen, 37, the following day, they found an axe and a balaclava in the back of his car.

Attack: Gemma Ford's ex-boyfriend Richard Mullen punched her so hard she was left with this 'Dad' imprint on her forehead from his sovereign ring. He attacked her for 30 minutes and left her bruised and battered

Mullen was sentenced to 36-weeks in jail in May but since serving around half his sentence he is free.

Mother-of-four Ms Ford has spoken out about her ordeal in order to warn other women about Mullen and domestic violence.

Ms Ford said: 'His sentence was disgusting, he should have got at least a couple of years, especially since he has an appalling record of domestic violence.

'I later found out that he was convicted for beating his ex with the same ring he hit me with and she still bears the scars.'

In May, Lincoln Crown Court was told how lorry driver Mullen’s relationship with Ms Ford, 28, had faltered after she discovered he had been texting a number of his former girlfriends.

Ms Ford, from Skegness, broke the relationship off but having believed Mullen’s pleas of innocence took him back.

Then, in March this year, they met up and went to a barbecue together where Ms Ford claims Mullen got drunk.

Weapon: A similar ring to the one used in the savage attack which left an imprint on Ms Ford for several weeks

She said: 'He was being loud and 
overly flirtatious with one of my friends from work and she told me that
he was making her uncomfortable.

'I
decided I was sick of his flirting. He had already broken my trust and I
struggled to believe that he had only been texting those other girls. I
made my mind up to end it with him when I got home.'

After
13 months together, Ms Ford ended the relationship and then went to 
bed. But as she was drifting off to sleep Mullen crept in her bedroom 
and the next thing she remembers was him sitting on top of her, 
squeezing her neck.

She said: 'My memory is hazy as I was 
slipping into unconsciousness but I remember his thumbs were pressing 
against my windpipe and he was saying ‘You b****, you’re not going to 
wake up in the morning’.

'At first I couldn’t believe what was happening but then I was terrified. I tried pleading with him but he wouldn’t let go.

'My
only option was to try and reason with him. I told him that if I didn’t
wake up in the morning he would have a dead body and four children 
without a mother to think about. That’s when he let go and instead 
started kicking and punching me.

'You often hear of people saying that 
someone looked possessed, but in his eyes he looked like something else 
was making him do it to me. It was as if he had to do it, like something
was forcing him.

Violence: The couple are pictured together in happier times. They were together for 13 months until Ms Ford called off the relationship but Mullen attacked her as she slept after creeping into her bedroom 

'It was 
such shock to think that this man I had been in love with - and I had 
been completely besotted with him at one time - could be capable of 
doing that to me.

'I remember him hitting me with the ring and I felt it against my skull. Before he hit me again he took it off.'

After the attack, which Ms Ford 
believes lasted around 30 minutes, Mullen tried to apologise and cuddle 
her but she ordered him to leave.

Injured: Ms Ford was left with bruising on her face and neck and said Mullen pressed against her windpipe

The next day she went to the hospital where she was told she had a broken nose for which she will need a rhinoplasty.

Doctors
also feared she had a broken jaw due to the amount of bruising on her 
face. The bruising from Mullen’s sovereign ring left an outline of the 
word ‘Dad’ which was visible for weeks.

At
the police station, she gave her statement and then went with friends 
to pick up some things from home so she could stay with them.

She said: 'The police wanted to put me
in a refuge but I point-blank refused. I wasn’t going to do that to my 
children and I suppose I also didn’t fully grasp how serious the 
situation was.

'Some male 
friends came with me to pick up some things and I arranged for my kids’ 
father to have them for a few days as we share custody.'

Just
half an hour after she left for a friend’s house, Ms Ford received a 
call from her panicked neighbour and was told how Mullen was hammering 
on her door and shouting for her to come out.

She called the police who, after short car chase, arrested Mullen and made the discovery in his boot.

Ms Ford said:
'I don’t know what he intended to do with the axe and the balaclava but
I guess he wasn’t there to apologise. I hate to think what he might 
have been capable of.

'Perhaps
he just wanted to intimidate me but after the beating I had received 
the night before I think he would have been capable of much worse.'

Mullen was bailed but quickly broke his bail conditions by contacting Ms Ford. He was rearrested and held on remand for 39 days to await trial.

When Mullen was interviewed he admitted striking her several times but could not recall strangling her.

Ms Ford was unable to go to work for two weeks due to her severe bruising and lost her job as a care worker for the elderly as a result of the attack.

Mullen, of Spilsby, Lincolnshire, admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm on March 28 and possession of a bladed article.

He was jailed for 36 weeks and was given a five year restraining order banning him from contacting Gemma or going within 25 metres of her home.

Michael Cranmer-Brown, defending, said Mullen was remorseful for what he did.

'It seems he over reacted at being rejected.'

Ms Ford said: 'I didn’t go to the court case because he wrote to me from jail asking me to go. I thought the sentence was absolutely appalling, he has got off lightly.

'I think he is a damaged individual and he needs help to sort himself out.

'I hope that by reading this he knows I’m not afraid of him and I want to warn other women about what he is like and what he is capable of doing.'
