Five teams competing for the $30 million Google Lunar XPrize have been awarded a total of $5.25 million for meeting key mission milestones.

The groups are all hoping to develop a robot that can land safely on the moon, travel 1,640ft (500 metres) on its surface, and send two 'Mooncasts' back to the Earth.

Among them is a small start-up from India, dubbed Team Indus, who has no experience in robotics, but has nevertheless managed to grab a $1 million of the prize.

Bangalore-based Team Indus has gone up against companies such as Moon Express which is billionaire-funded and has received a number of technologies from Nasa to get a head start.

According to Dilip Chabria, co-founder: 'The Team Indus moon mission can cost us anywhere between $30 million and $40 million, depending on the cost of the launch vehicle.'

And this is money that will have to be raised through sponsorships, prizes and crowdfunding – a daunting task.

Hakuto is designing a 'Dual Rover' system, consisting of two-wheeled 'Tetris' and four-wheeled 'Moonraker'

Astrobotic (Pittsburgh, US): Imaging ($250,000), Mobility ($500,000), Landing ($1 million)

Hakuto (Japan): Mobility ($500,000)

Moon Express (California, US): Imaging ($250,000), Landing ($1 million)

Part-Time Scientists (Germany): Imaging ($250,000), Mobility ($500,000)

Team Indus (India): Landing ($1 million) 

The other teams to gain a share of the prize included Astrobotic, Hakuto, Moon Express and Part-Time Scientists.

Astrobiotic hopes to fund the development of its lunar landing by offering to take items to them moon - with prices ranging from $460 to $26,000.

The firm, which has dubbed the service MoonMail, says it can even offer to give over entire missions for larger items that need more shipping space.

They plan to launch on a SpaceX rocket. After achieving low Earth orbit, the Falcon 9 second stage re-ignites for trans-lunar injection (TLI) to propel Astrobotic's spacecraft into a 4.5-day cruise to the moon.

Part-Time Scientists has designed a rover that relies on three imaging systems. The two outer cameras provide stereoscopic vision for navigation. The center one will provide the high-definition colour imagery

The Google Lunar Xprize  aims to do something we haven't done as humanity since 1973 - land on the surface of the moon.

'More than half of the world's population has never had the opportunity to view a live transmission from the lunar surface,' say the organisers.

The prize aims to create a new 'Apollo' moment for this generation and to spur continuous lunar exploration with $40 million in incentive based prizes.

In order to win this money, a private company must land safely on the surface of the Moon, travel 640ft (500 metres) on its surface, and send two signals back to the Earth.

The system consists of two spacecraft, a lander and the Polaris rover; lander and rover exist as a single spacecraft until touchdown on the lunar surface.

Hakuto, meanwhile, is designing a 'Dual Rover' system, consisting of two-wheeled 'Tetris' and four-wheeled 'Moonraker.' 

The two rovers are linked by a tether so that Tetris can be lowered into craters on the moon's surface.

Part-Time Scientists from Germany has designed a rover that relies on three imaging systems. The two outer cameras provide stereoscopic vision for navigation. The center one, meanwhile, will provide the high-definition colour imagery.

Finally, Moon Express has created the 'MX'-family of scalable landers which it claims are capable of reaching the lunar surface and other destinations from Earth orbit on direct or low-energy trajectories.

'The $30 million Google Lunar XPrize is asking teams to accomplish a feat that has never been achieved,' said Robert Weiss, vice chairman and president, XPrize

'The goal of this unprecedented competition is to challenge and inspire engineers and entrepreneurs from around the world to develop low-cost methods of robotic space exploration.'

For each Milestone Prize category, teams carried out a number of hardware tests representative of their planned lunar mission, while sharing design information and analysis with the judging panel.

Last year Science Channel and Discovery Channel today announced that the networks will serve as television homes for the Google Lunar XPrize.

They will follow the entire process including testing, lift-off, and live coverage of the winning lunar landing, due to take place in December 2016.

Among the winners s a small start-up from India, dubbed Team Indus, who has no experience in robotics, but has nevertheless managed to grab $1 million of the prize
