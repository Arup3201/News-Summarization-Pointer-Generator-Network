Toy company Hasbro has come under fire for releasing a Play-doh mould for ages 'three and up' which outraged parents are claiming looks like a plastic penis.

The Sweet Shoppe Cake Mountain Playset, which retails for $40 in Australia, is intended for ages three and up to create layer cakes and frosting with play-doh moulds.

Parents flocked to social media to complain about the 'unsuitable' and 'inappropriate'  phallic shaped 'extruder' tool, claiming that it ruined their Christmas and sexualised child's play.

The plastic 'extruder' tool included in the Playset has been labelled inappropriate by outraged parents

Pictures of the offending product circulated on social media, with some users labelling the extruder, a tool similar to a baker's pipette, a 'dil-doh'

'This is NOT okay. This completely ruined our Christmas', claimed one parent on Facebook, who bought the moulding set for her daughters.

'Can you believe Play-Doh made this disgusting toy for kids??? Play dil-doh??? Play-doh makes penis shaped extruder.. wow!!', posted another Facebook user to the Play-doh Facebook page.

The Sweet Shoppe Playset has been on the market for several months, but caused a stir just before Christmas when many children received the Sweet Shoppe Playset as a present.

 The company offered 'replacement extruders' for customers who were still offended by the tool, a move which had been in place since early November

'People seriously need to calm down. Your 6 year old is not going to look at a play-doh toy and think of a male genital. If they are, you seriously need to look at your parenting,' said one Facebook user

'This was a conversation piece for my family at Christmas morning breakfast. Needless to say we were all shaking our heads. My three year old will not be playing with it at all (it's been thrown away). Play-Doh, I have a feeling this was no coincidence:/' said another parent.

The company's Facebook page became inundated with complaints and photographs of the tool in question, which were systematically deleted by the company.

Social media users became enraged when they realised their comments about the extruder had been removed, labelling it censorship and calling it a 'PR fail'.

'Why do you delete the picture of your dil-doh toy? You made it! There shouldn't be anything you sell to kids that you can't post of facebook, correct?'

Play-doh released a statement which said they had received the consumer feedback about the extruder and that the company was 'in the process of updating all future Play-Doh products with a different tool'

However, many customers came to the defense of Play-doh, labelling the complaints 'ridiculous' and claiming that the parents were responsible for the sexualisation of an innocent toy.

'People are taking this way too far. There is nothing wrong with the design. You can't take apart and item and then complain about what it looks like. Grow up!' said one Facebook user.

Other parents made light of the situation, joking that they wouldn't let their children eat bananas, hot dogs, or cucumbers, because they were similarly phallic shaped
