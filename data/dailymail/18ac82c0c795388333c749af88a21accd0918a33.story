A body found in brush near a Southern California lake was identified on Wednesday as a Marine's wife whose disappearance last week led to the arrest of a woman and the investigation of another Marine.

Coroner's investigators determined the body discovered Tuesday was that of 22-year-old Brittany Dawn Killgore.

The disclosure came a day after authorities arrested Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, on suspicion of murder and continued to investigate Louis Ray Perez, the last person seen with Killgore, as a person of interest in the case.

Tragic: The body of Brittany Killgore was discovered on Tuesday, four days after she was last seen with a marine who was later arrested on an unrelated charge

Suspect: Authorities believe that the victim knew Jessica Lynn Lopez, and the two were involved in some kind of sex slave ring

Authorities have not disclosed how the three know one another.

Perez, 45, pleaded not guilty 
on Wednesday to stealing a AR-15 rifle from Camp Pendleton. Investigators have given few 
details about that case, and it was not known if they suspect the weapon
was tied to Killgore's death.

Perez was being held on $500,000 
bond. His attorney Jeffrey Reichert said his client has no criminal 
history, is married and has lived in San Diego County for 10 years.

Lopez was scheduled to be arraigned Thursday.

Killgore went missing shortly after 
filing for divorce from her husband, a 22-year-old Marine deployed to 
Afghanistan.

Her body was found in brush near Lake Skinner in Riverside 
County about 25 miles northeast of her modest, two-story apartment in 
Fallbrook, a San Diego County community known for its avocado orchards.

Killgore lived a short walk from an 
entrance to Camp Pendleton, and her complex - like others around it - is
full of Marines and their families who tend to be short-term residents 
and often don't get to know each other well.

Killgore's husband, Lance Corporal 
Cory Killgore, was flying back to California after learning his wife was
missing. Sheriff's authorities say he is not a suspect.

The couple from Missouri were married
in July 2010. Brittany Killgore filed for divorce April 10 and listed 
'irreconcilable differences' as the reason. She gave no details on the 
paperwork.

Her cellphone was found in the Gaslamp District of downtown San Diego.

Darryl J Wrest of Rolla, Missouri, 
confirmed Brittany Killgore is his daughter but said he was not 
commenting on anything at this time. Killgore's other family members 
also declined to comment.

Authorities investigating the homicide said a suicide note
of the prime suspect contained key details about the case, including 
the location of a body.

Authorities in California are now reportedly examining a possible link between Killgore, the suspect, and a seedy sex ring.

ABC 10 reported that officers later responded to a Ramada Inn near the San Diego Airport, 
where they found a woman with stab wounds all over her body in an 
apparent suicide attempt.

That woman, 27-year-old lopez, was arrested at the scene but hospitalised at UCSD Medical Center.

She was discharged from the hospital on Wednesday, and charged with murder in Killgore's death.

A neighbour, who declined to be identified, told ABC 10 that both Lopez and the victim took part in some kind of sex ring.

She said: 'They're into the sex slave things... I try not to judge, but that's what they're into'.

Cory Killgore was deployed to Afghanistan earlier this year as a vehicle operator.
