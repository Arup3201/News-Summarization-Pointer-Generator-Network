These terrifying photos show the men who climb 80 metres just to go work to fixing pylons in China.

The men, wearing blue helmets, are seen scaling along the wires as they carry out their work.

Today they were pictured examining and repairing the rural power grid at Yongkang Town in Chuzhou City, east China's Anhui Province.

Head for heights: An electrician examines and repairs the rural power grid at the height of more than 80 metres

Don't look down: They took to the great height to ensure an electricity supply for the spring plow at Yongkang Town in Chuzhou City, east China's Anhui Province

Moving along: Working as a team the men have safety harnesses attached to them as they move slowly along

Working as a team the men have safety harnesses attached to them as they move slowly along.

Wearing white gloves to stop thier hands freezing at such a great height the men were quickly while strong winds blow around them at such a great height.

Although their view looks scary it is nothing next to the world's tallest pylons which are also in China.

China’s plan to build a 270m-high electricity pylon between Anhui Province and the economic hub of Shanghai has those construction workers working at heights similar to that of London’s Shard.
