It's seems that many of the fashion choices at last night's MOBO awards were dominated by black, sheer and sparkle, which either worked for some or really didn't for others.

Two of the best dressed stars from the red carpet were Nicole Scherzinger and Myleene Klass who both opted for figure hugging numbers.

Nicole, 36, wore a black leather dress with sheer cut outs in a lace effect with a plunging neckline.

But the Big Fat Lie singer managed to keep the look very classy with a below-the-knee hemline, simple make-up and jewellery. Her boots, though, were an odd choice.

She later changed into a cool sports luxe cream and black two piece and strappy sandals.

The former X Factor judge showed off her sculpted abs in the outfit during her performance of her latest ballad, On The Rocks.

Myleene, meanwhile, opted for a leopard effect gold sequin dress from her own collection at Littlewoods, retailing at just £150, which exemplified her curvy frame.

The classically trained pianist, also 36, kept her tousled highlighted swept to one side while her bronzed make-up enhanced her olive skin tone.

During the ceremony shared a table with handsome TV personality Rob Evans - with whom she later presented an award.

Singer Tori Kelly showed off her sensational legs in a cute black jumpsuit and killer shoe boots. She styled her curly hair to the side and wore natural make-up.

Eve looked gorgeous in an embellished silver mini dress and wore her hair in a sleek, straight style paired with a strong red lip.

Pretty singer Alexa Goddard's look was strong but understated. She paired a voluminous white mini skirt with oversize metallic vest and crimped her hair. 

TOWIE's Lauren Pope went for the plunge effect and dressed her slim frame in a thigh skimming black and diamanté detailed dress with a deep V effect on the chest. 

The outfit had a wrap detail on the skirt and lovely long sleeves with peek-a-boo detail showing off her sculpted shoulders.

The DJ, 32, wore her long blonde hair half in a perfect, sleek style and went for a thick black eyeliner on the eyes, adding colour with a peach blusher.

The MOBO awards were set up 19 years ago to promote and celebrate music of black origin and have returned to London after a five year absence. 

And the HTC-sponsored event at the SSE Arena in Wembley saw plenty of fashion misses, as well as the hits. Tulisa, Jessie J and Mel B led the way.

Former N-Dubz star Tulisa arrived in a customised fitted fishtail midi skirt from Pinghe with gold leaf stilettos by Giuseppe Zanotti. She paired her structured crop top with an odd gold necklace.

The singer later changed into a dress which appeared to be made of multiple Velcro snakeskin belts. The knee length shapeless number flattened her curves and its length made the petite star look rather stumpy.

Jessie also swamped her figure during red carpet arrivals in a baggy sparkly brown jumpsuit split to the navel. The signer, 26, accessorised her look, which did little to emphasise her shape and left her in danger of baring all, with a gold body chain.

She scooped the Best Female gong and the changed into an extremely skimpy outfit of bra top and knickers, and a long black wig, to perform in a ring of fire.

Co-host Mel B, meanwhile, turned up in a daring tight white one shoulder dress with thigh split and splattering of gold sequins. The 39-year-old X Factor judge teamed her look with skyscraper heels and a black clutch bag.

She majorly missed the mark when she took to the stage later on to host the event with presenter Sarah-Jane Crawford.

Mel wore a very exposing sparkly red fishnet dress which barely covered her bottom, and also managed to show off some underboob. 

Sarah-Jane joined her in an odd patchwork dress in various hues of blue.

MC Harvey's take on the granddad look was more Jim Branning than Pharrell

Jameela swamped her frame in an unflattering full-length red dress. The voluminous frock featured diamanté straps and belt detail. 

Amy Childs, meanwhile, the first celebrity to arrive on the red carpet, brazenly flashed her cleavage in a plunging black dress.

The outfit with diamanté detailing around its neckline certainly drew attention to Amy's curves. The beautician, 24, managed to show off her bright tan by going barelegged. 

It was clearly a last-minute choice, as before attending the event held at Wembley Arena, she tweeted she was at a loss what to wear, saying: 'So excited for the MOBOs tonight ...... Just decided what to wear.'
