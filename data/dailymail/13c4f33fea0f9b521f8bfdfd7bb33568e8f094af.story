Louis van Gaal has spoken of the 'special' bond he enjoys with Jose Mourinho as the two managers go head-to-head at Old Trafford.

The Manchester United manager embraced his Chelsea counterpart in the tunnel ahead of the match and had some nice words saved up for his close friend.

Mourinho worked as Van Gaal's assistant when he was in charge of Barcelona between 1997 and 2000.

Initially a translator, Mourinho was promoted by Van Gaal to become an integral member of his coaching staff, taking training sessions and giving team talks.

Speaking to Sky Sports, the Dutchman said: 'He is special. He is becoming big in the football world.

'I know him when he was my assistant. He had to analyse the matches of my opponents and did very well. He came to my house every week and is a friend.'

But slipping back into matchday mode, he added with a smirk: 'We have to be careful with our relationship.'

This is only the second time the two men have come up against one another as managers. The other was in the 2010 Champions League final when Mourinho's Inter Milan beat Van Gaal's Bayern Munich 2-0.
