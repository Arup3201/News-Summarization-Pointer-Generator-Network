As former world heavyweight champion, boxer David Haye is used to getting his own way in the ring.

And now, he appears to have escaped from a tricky situation on the roads too after being let off for speeding. 

The 33-year-old even posed for a 'selfie' with a police officer who pulled him over - before thanking him for allowing him to go free.

However, he avoided getting a speeding ticket after Met Police officers gave him a verbal warning.

He then posed for a 'selfie' with one of the officers, Hitesh Patel, who later tweeted the image, saying: 'When we met after you were "enjoying" your car.'

The photo shows Haye smiling at the camera with his arm slung around PC Patel, who is dressed in uniform and also grinning broadly.

Fighting back: It comes just days after Haye announced he could return to the ring - less than six months after being advised to retire by doctors

Haye, who is also the former unified world cruiserweight champion, is known for his passion for fast, expensive cars.

His luxury fleet has included a black Bentley Continental GT, worth £155,000, which he got free as part of a sponsorship deal, and a £100,000 Mercedes SL500, which was written off by his bodyguard in 2010. 

The speeding incident involving Haye and PC Patel took place three years ago, but the officer only posted the photo this week.

Scotland Yard told MailOnline: 'Approximately three years ago in Kensington and Chelsea, the officer stopped a driver for driving too fast in a built up area, and gave the driver a verbal warning.

'The officer recently sent a photograph from that night out on twitter, which he chose to delete after receiving negative feedback.'

Haye was unavailable for comment.

It comes just days after the boxer announced he could return to the ring - less than six months after being advised to retire by doctors.

The boxer underwent reconstructive surgery on his shoulder on November, and the injury looked certain to force him to hang up his gloves.

But after five months of rehab work, the 'Hayemaker' said he was close to throwing a punch again - and has not ruled out fighting in the future.

He said: 'No decisions have been made with regards to my future as a professional boxer.'
