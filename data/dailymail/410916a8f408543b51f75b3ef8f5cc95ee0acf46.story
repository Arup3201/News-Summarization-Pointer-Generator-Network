Daring artist Marcey Hawk - otherwise known as the 'Boobie Painter' - has filmed her very risqué painting process.

Covering her 30D breasts in paint, the Californian jiggles and swishes her bosoms across a stretched canvas to create an abstract picture.

The eye-catching pieces have been bought by celebrities such as Russell Brand and Hugh Hefner, and now Marcey lifts the lid on how she paints them in two exclusive videos.

Busty artist Marcey is putting her 30D breasts to good use - by using them as tools to paint

Marcey donates a portion of all sales to the Susan G Komen Foundation, a charity which fight against breast cancer

She uses a mixture of colours and positions her breasts in different directions and shapes to create her 'erotic' pieces.

Marcey has five methods she favours: 
the whole breast print; nipple print; 'just the tip' method; the 'squish
 and swirl' and her newest method which she calls the 'titty twerk'.

She then sells her breast pieces online with some fetching up to $500 (£300).

Since
 creating her first painting in 2006, Marcey, from California, USA, has 
created thousands of pieces which she sells from her online shop.

'My art is meant to be intimate, 
erotic, explorative and unique with a hint of whimsy - I call it chaotic
 yet contained abstraction,' she says.

'I
 began painting with my boobs after viewing a performance artist drip 
paint over her naked body and roll around on a large canvas sheet.

'For her the art was about public display however I was intrigued by some of the marks left behind by her painted body. 

She uses a mixture of colours and angles her breasts in different directions and shapes to paint

'Her performance led me to my 
experimentation and my artist niche was born. My biggest influences in 
the art world are Jackson Pollock and Vincent Van Gogh.

Marcey
 donates a portion of all sales to the Susan G Komen Foundation for 
their fight against breast cancer. She also creates specially 
commissioned work in her unique style.

'My
 paintings have been shipped all over the world - from the UK to 
Australia and can be found in almost every US state,' she says.

'Some of the more well known owners of my work include people such as Hugh Hefner, Russell Brand and Rob Dyrdek.

Russell Brand and Hugh Hefner have both bought pieces from Marcey

Since starting out in 2006, Marcey, from California, has sold many paintings, worth around £300 each

'My art is meant to be intimate, erotic, explorative and unique with a hint of whimsy' explains Marcey

'I
 like to mix up my styles so have a good variety - the 'squish and 
swirl' method is the one I use the most which involves using both 
breasts squishing and swirling the paint onto the canvas.

'My
 newest style which is proving popular is the 'tittie twerk' where the 
canvas is primed in a solid colour and while it's still wet I use just 
about a quarter of my breast covered in paint and sort of jiggle it 
around.'

It's not hard to spot which method Marcey has used to paint these particular pieces (Clue: it's the whole breast print)
