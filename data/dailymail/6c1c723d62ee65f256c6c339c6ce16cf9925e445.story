A 29-year-old father-of-three has died in a skydiving accident in Southern California.

Jason Granger, from Yuma, Arizona, was killed just before noon on Friday after he made a hard landing, according to the coroner's report.

Police in the city of Perris responded at around 11:20 a.m. to reports of an air emergency at the popular skydiving site of Perris Valley airport.

They arrived to find Granger, an Army skydiver who trained other jumpers, suffering serious injuries after a parachuting accident.

Paramedics rushed the man to Menifee Valley Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 12:17 p.m.

Perris Valley Skydiving general manager Dan Brodsky-Chenfeld told the Press Enterprise the man was coming in for a landing when he made a turn at low altitude.

Such turns increase a jumper's speed and are prohibited below 300 feet at that drop zone for that reason, Brodsky-Chenfeld said.

He said he didn't know Granger's elevation when he turned, but it was very low.

Sad: Paramedics rushed the man to Menifee Valley Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 12:17 p.m.

'We're not sure why he made that turn,' Brodsky-Chenfeld told the newspaper.

He added that the cause of the crash had nothing to do with equipment failure, weather conditions or collisions.

The man was jumping by himself, not with the military, and was not training any other jumpers at the time, he said.

Brodsky-Chenfeld said he had brought a family member to Perris Valley on Friday but in the fatal fall hew as jumping alone.Â

Dangerous: There have been at least 15 deaths at the Perris Valley Airport skydiving facility, pictured, in the past 13 years

The man's identity and further details on the accident were released Saturday.

There have been at least 15 deaths at the Perris Valley Airport skydiving facility in the past 13 years, according to the Press-Enterprise.

Though after a rash of major accidents in 2011 and 2012, it has been a mostly quiet year for skydiving injuries at the national mecca for the sport about 75 miles southeast of Los Angeles.

A U.S. Marine died in an accident near the same airport in February.

A 62-year-old skydiver died in Lake Elsinore in May.

He was part of a group of skydivers who were attempting a multiple-person maneuver when he became entangled in a parachute and was unable to free himself.

Granger's family outside the emergency room when they learned he had died but declined to speak to the press.
