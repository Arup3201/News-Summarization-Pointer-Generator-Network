Guilty of assault: Peter Samms went to the home of his son's ex-girlfriend Stephanie Wardn

The father of footballer Danny Simpson has been found guilty of assault after a bust-up with his son’s former girlfriend.

Bodybuilder Peter Samms confronted Stephanie Ward, 25, after she revealed how the Newcastle United star had 'cheated' on her with X-Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos in a national newspaper.

Samms, 46, barged into Miss Ward’s home in Worsley, Greater Manchester, just hours after she had aborted the child she was carrying with the footballer.

During the confrontation, last November, Samms acted in an 'intimidating and threatening' manner, magistrates in Manchester heard.

Miss Ward’s mother Gillian, who had answered the door when Samms arrived at the house, was knocked off balance as he went past her.

Samms allegedly warned Miss Ward that he had 'gangster friends' and she would never be able to go out in Manchester again.

Prosecutor Rebecca Radcliffe told magistrates that Samms, who works as a security guard, was intimidating 'in terms of body language and physical movement'.

Samms, of Ellesmere St, Manchester, denied  common assault and a charge of using threatening or abusive words or behaviour.

He was cleared of the second count but found guilty of common assault.

Samms was fined £375 and ordered to pay £400 costs and £100 to his victim.

Lashing out: Tulisa Contostavlos has been branded a 'homewrecker' for reportedly romancing Newcastle ace Danny Simpson

Last November, Miss Ward revealed how she’d been left devastated after finding out Simpson had been dating 24-year-old Tulisa.

She branded the singer a 'home-wrecker', adding: “She’s been sleeping in my bed! Danny has humiliated me in front of my family, friends and the whole nation.”

But Tulisa’s lawyers later issued a statement saying: “Tulisa categorically denies any allegation that she entered any relationship with Danny Simpson while he was still in a relationship with Stephanie Ward.'

Ms Ward told The Sun newspaper: 'We've been off-and-on for the last seven years - but absolutely solid for the last two.

'As
 far as I'm concerned he has cheated on me because we hadn't broken up 
or anything. She's a home-wrecker and has destroyed my family.'

Happy families: Danny has a baby daughter, Skye-Lorena, with his on-off girlfriend of seven years, Stephanie Ward

The pretty brunette is the mother of Simpson's baby daughter Skye-Lorena. She had been reportedly three months pregnant with their second child. 

It's believed Tulisa met the footballer through mutual friends, before enjoying a date together.

Her fans will have been hoping the singer is finally having some good luck in the romance stakes after a series of heartbreaks in recent years.

She split from her bandmate and boyfriend of two years Fazer earlier this year.

A video of the singer and her ex-boyfriend Justin Edwards also emerged on the internet.

Tulisa filed a lawsuit against her ex and it was settled in July - with Edwards subsequently apologising for releasing the tape.

Tulisa also dated skins star Jack O'Connell, but their romance eventually fizzled out.
