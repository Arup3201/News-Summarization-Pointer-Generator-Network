Atheist: Richard Dawkins made the comments during a debate on Twitter with some of his followers

Richard Dawkins risked provoking fury today by claiming foetuses with Down's syndrome should be aborted - and parents should 'try again'.

The controversial comments from the scientist, who is a vocal atheist, came during a debate on Twitter with some of his 1million followers.

A discussion began when Professor Dawkins posted a link to an article in liberal US magazine New Republic entitled 'The Catholic Church prefers medieval barbarism to modern abortion'.

Professor Dawkins, 73, said: 'Ireland is a civilised country except in this one area. You'd think the Roman Church would have lost all influence.'

In response, Irish Catholic fitter Aidan McCourt asked him: '994 human beings with Down's syndrome deliberately killed before birth in England and Wales in 2012. Is that civilised?'

Professor Dawkins said: 'Yes, it is very civilised. These are foetuses, diagnosed before they have human feelings.'

He later added: 'Learn to think in non-essentialist ways. The question is not "is it 'human'?" but "can it suffer?"'

Then, he was told by Boston-based writer 'InYourFaceNewYorker': 'I honestly don't know what I would do if I were pregnant with a kid with Down's syndrome. Real ethical dilemma.'

Professor Dawkins replied: 'Abort it and try again. It would be immoral to bring it into the world if you have the choice.'

But
 campaigners and charity workers contested Professor Dawkins's statements, saying 
that the disability does not stop people having 'full and rewarding 
lives'.

Comments: A discussion began when Dawkins posted a link to an article in liberal US magazine New Republic entitled 'The Catholic Church prefers medieval barbarism to modern abortion'

Carol Boys, chief executive of the Down's Syndrome Association, told MailOnline: 'People with Down’s syndrome can and do live full and rewarding lives, they also make a valuable contribution to our society. 

'At the Down’s Syndrome Association, we do not believe Down’s syndrome in itself should be a reason for termination, however, we realise that families must make their own choice.

'The DSA strives to ensure that all prospective parents are given accurate and up to date information about the condition and what life might be like today for someone with Down’s syndrome.'

And the Pro-Life campaign in Ireland said the comments were 'chilling' and 'deeply insulting'.

A spokesman told MailOnline: 'These shocking comments by Professor Richard Dawkins are a chilling reminder of how easy it is for society to fall into the trap of deeming some human beings "imperfect" and unworthy of life.

'To suggest that unborn babies diagnosed with Down's Syndrome should be discarded through abortion is deeply insulting to children with this special need and their families.

Objection: People used tweeted their disgust at Professor Dawkins's comments

'Cruel': Irish human rights activist Cora Sherlock condemned the comments as wilful controversy

'No less human': Christian Guy, the head of the Centre for Social Justice think tank, also criticised Dawkins

'All human beings are entitled to live their lives to the fullest of their capabilities. In a compassionate society, we must work together to put in place the supports and assistance that will make this possible for everyone.'

Professor Dawkins's comments come after he said last week that having a faith helped foster terrorism. He suggested those who believe in God enable suicide bombers to murder thousands and make the ‘world safe’ for extremists.

And last month he referred to ‘mild date rape’ and ‘mild paedophilia’ in comments on Twitter.

Campaigners for women and child abuse victims condemned those posts as ‘offensive and damaging’. He became embroiled in the row when he made a point about logical thinking. 

Adored: Grace Reynolds, has Down's Syndrome. Her family say her coming into the world has been hard, but immensely rewarding

The father of a one-year-old girl with Down’s Syndrome has told Richard Dawkins aborting his child, as he advocates, would have been ‘the greatest mistake of my life’.

Justus Reynolds, from Syracuse, Utah, found out that his daughter, Grace, had the condition shortly after she was born. When he saw the academic’s comments he tweeted back his point of view.

Speaking to MailOnline, Mr Reynolds said that caring for Grace has ‘made life harder’ but that that it is impossible to measure the joy of being her father.

He said: ‘My wife and I found out our baby had Down’s Syndrome just after she was born, I'll be the first to admit that I was heartbroken by the news.

‘I didn't know anything about Down’s Syndrome and really struggled to come to terms with all the dreams that I had for her that likely wouldn't come true. But as I got to know her, those dreams became less important.

‘She has completely changed the dynamic of our family. She has three older siblings, and they completely adore her. She is a complete joy to have in our home.

‘The dreams I have for her now are different than when she was born but I still have dreams. There are tough times, she has health problems related to Down’s Syndrome that will make life harder for all of us, but I wouldn't trade any of that if it meant not getting to know her.

‘I don't think it is "civilized" to abort a foetus that has Down’s Syndrome to avoid difficulties in the future, because you will also lose any joy that you would have had from having a wonderful child of God as part of your family.

‘Is it easy? Nope. Is it worth every trouble? Yes it is.’

Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder that delays a person's growth and causes intellectual disability.

The condition was first detailed by English physician John Langdon Down in 1862. He later characterised it as a mental disability in a widely published report in 1866.

Most babies with Down's syndrome are diagnosed shortly after birth and are likely to have reduced muscle tone, eyes that slant upwards, a low birth weight, a small nose and mouth and short fingers.

They also have some degree of learning disability but this varies widely between children. Some children with Down's syndrome also have associated health problems such as heart disorders, digestive problems, hearing and visual impairments, thyroid dysfunction and blood disorders.

It is one of the most common genetic causes of learning disability and around 750 babies are born with the condition each year in the UK.

It is caused by the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21 in the baby's cells. Currently, no one knows what causes the presence of the extra chromosome but Down's syndrome is more common in children born to older mothers.

For example, if a woman has a baby when she is 25 there is a one in 1,250 chance of her baby having Down's syndrome, but if a 45-year-old woman has a baby, there is a one in 30 chance of it having Down's syndrome.
