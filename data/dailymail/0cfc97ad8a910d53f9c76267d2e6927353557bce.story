A Dunkin' Donuts employee in Connecticut has stopped a would-be robber with the nearest weapon available: hot coffee.

The worker, identified only as Angelica, threw a cup and then a pot of coffee at the man after he tried to force his way through the  drive-through window of the West Haven branch of the fast-food chain.

The man drove up to the window at 11 p.m. on Saturday, took out a $100 bill and asked for change, but the worker refused, according to Sgt. David Tammaro, of the West Haven Police Department.

Defense: The quick-thinking employee grabbed the man's hot coffee and threw it at him to keep him away

When Angelica tried to close the window, the man stopped her with his arm, announced it was a robbery and tried to climb into the store.

'He... tried to get out of 
his car. That's when I realised he was serious,' she told NBC Connecticut. 'I tried to close the 
window. He put his arm in it. He knew not to touch, because he knew 
there would be fingerprints.'

Then she remembered the cup of coffee that she had made for him.

'I looked at [it] quick, threw him the 
first one,' she recounted. 'Looked at the pots of coffee and threw the pot of coffee at 
him.

Next move: As he persevered, she grabbed a pot of hot coffee and threw that at him too

Success! As she emptied the pot of coffee, he eventually gave up, jumped in his car and drove off

'That's when he started running into his truck and then he left, 
and I said, "Go run on Dunkin",' referring to the chain's catchphrase: America Runs on Dunkin.

The man, who has still not been identified, jumped back into his white Ford Explorer and drove away.

The interaction and Angelica's quick thinking was captured on the store's surveillance camera, which has been released by West Haven Police Department in a bid to track down the man.
