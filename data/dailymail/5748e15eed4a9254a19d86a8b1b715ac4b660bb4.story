A U.S. Congressman has instigated a federal investigation of the TSA today after his teenage niece had her breasts exposed during a security pat-down.

Representative Ralph Hall of Texas said his gran-niece, 17, was 'badly mistreated' when she had her dress pulled down during security screening at an airport.

The young woman was part of a group of pupils traveling from Southwest Christian School, Texas to Australia.

Scrutiny: Hartsfield-Jackson Airport where the 17-year-old had her breasts exposed while going through security

The Congressman wants the agent who touched his niece fired from Hartsfield-Jackson Airport in Atlanta, Georgia. 

In a statement to MailOnline today, the TSA said: 'We regret that the incident of more than two years ago was one that caused embarrassment to the young lady, however, an investigation concluded that the event was accidental.'

MailOnline was awaiting a response from Mr Hall's press office in D.C.

The senator for Georgia, Saxby Chambliss, has also contacted the TSA in his state about 'potentially invasive screenings'.

The incident involving Mr Hall's gran-niece happened two years ago but has just come to light under the Freedom of Information Act after it was caught on CCTV.

A Transportation Security Administration report said 'during the pat-down of her stomach area' the straps of the girl's dress slipped and her breasts were exposed, according to wsbtv.

The agency, which is continually criticized for increased numbers of pat-downs, said the officer was given more training and apologized. 

Solange Knowles tweeted her outrage 
last week after claiming that TSA officers at Miami airport  searched 
her afro for explosives.

Outrage: Rep Ralph Hall of Texas wants a federal investigation into the TSA after his niece, 17 had her breasts exposed during pat-down

Intrusive: There have been thousands of complaints made to the TSA over their airport search procedures

The DJ wrote 'I kid you not. This
 just happened to me', and posted a link to a news article about a woman
 who was left humiliated after a hair pat-down at the Hartsfield-Jackson
 International airport in Atlanta, last year.

Ms Knowles, Beyoncé's sister, later said: 'Discrim-FRO-nation... My hair is not a storage drawer... Lets play a little game called: What did TSA find in Solange's Fro?'

According to the TSA, there is a strict process regarding pat-downs. The close body search occurs if passengers cannot or choose not to go through imaging technology or metal detector. The rules state:

The passenger Ms Knowles was referring to was hairdresser Isis Brantley.

She was stopped at
 Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport last year after she
 had passed a scanning device.

As she travelled down an escalator, she claims she heard someone yell: 'Hey you, hey you, ma'am, stop. Stop - the lady with the hair, you.’

Two TSA agents told her she could not go any further until they checked her hair for explosives, said Miss Brantley, of Dallas, Texas.

Reluctantly she allowed them to do it
 and the TSA staff patted her hair down right there instead of asking to
 return to a private area for screening.

‘And
 so she started patting my hair, and I was in tears at that point,’ Miss
 Brantley told NBC News. ‘And she was digging in my scalp.’

In
 a separate incident last month, a Boston woman claimed TSA agents 
walked off with thousands of dollars’ worth of jewellery from her 
luggage.

Terri
 Ivester said an agent at Logan International Airport, who stopped her 
at a security checkpoint, took the bag, and returned it with the 
jewellery missing.

Fury: Beyoncé's sister tweeted to her followers about the TSA's actions
