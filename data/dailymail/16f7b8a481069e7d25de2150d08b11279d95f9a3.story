Tottenham Hotspur winger Erik Lamela is clearly enjoying his mini-break from football as he enjoyed dinner with his family in Spain.

He posted a picture of the Lamela clan to his Instagram account along with the caption: 'Visiting family in Spain, enjoying my day off. Hello to everybody. #españa #galicia #villalba'

The Tottenham players are currently enjoying a few days off and are not back in action until Sunday's clash against Manchester United.

Lamela, who joined the north London club from Roma in 2013, helped Spurs go sixth in the Premier League on Saturday as they beat relegation candidates QPR.

The Argentinean only managed 11 minutes of the London derby, but it didn't stop him from jetting out to Galicia for a relaxing break.

Pochettino's side can go level on points with Louis van Gaal's Manchester United if they can beat the Red Devils at Old Trafford when they return to action on Sunday.
