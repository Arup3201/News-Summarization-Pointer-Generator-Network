It was an extraordinary thing to say, akin to putting your head in the noose and stepping up on the stool beneath the gallows.

Guus Hiddink, who started his second spell as Holland manager just 70 days ago on September 4, could be out of a job come Sunday night as a consequence of his own words.

He has, in effect, filled out his own P45 form and is awaiting the rubber-stamp from his employer.

Hiddink said of the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifier with Latvia in Amsterdam: 'If we lose, it makes sense that I leave.'

And after Wednesday night's 3-2 friendly loss to Mexico heaped even more pressure on his shoulders, Hiddink, sounding as gloomy as a man writing his own obituary, confirmed: 'Yes, I will still leave if we lose to Latvia.'

Even by the standards of their recent slump - a post-World Cup hangover that has seen four defeats in five matches - Holland should beat a team ranked 99th in the world.

Following Michel Platini's tinkering, expanding the tournament from 16 to 24 games and ushering through up to three teams from each qualifying group, Holland will not fail to reach the finals.

But after Wednesday night, Hiddink is not as certain as he was when he made that ultimatum on himself last weekend.

The odds were stacked against the former Chelsea caretaker boss from the outset. Holland were excellent at the World Cup, finishing third, and Louis van Gaal returned from Brazil and headed off to Manchester United a national hero.

The way he had his team playing vibrant, attacking football was a tough act to follow and so it has proved. There had been criticism of his return in some quarters, with plenty saying Ronald Koeman should have come in.

And the results have been underwhelming to say the least. In Hiddink's first game, a friendly with Italy in Bari at the start of September, they found themselves two-down inside the first 10 minutes.

In their opening Euro qualifier, against the Czech Republic, they were beaten by a stoppage time goal by Vaclav Pilar.

In last month's double-header, they had to come from behind to beat lowly Kazakhstan and then slumped to a 2-0 defeat in Iceland, leaving them third in the standings.

And their glaring weaknesses were exposed in an exciting game with Mexico at the Amsterdam ArenA.

After Wesley Sneijder had rewarded a high-tempo start to the second-half by bringing Holland level at 1-1, they were unlocked at the back by a sweeping Jesus Corona ball, which left Carlos Vela to score his second of the night.

And Mexico's third was the worst. Joel Veltman was woefully out of step with the rest of the back line, playing Javier Hernandez onside as he received Andres Guardado's through ball, rounded Tim Krul and finished.

Arjen Robben was highly critical of the Dutch defence after the match, saying there is no 'security or stability'

On both occasions, Hiddink sat in shock on the bench, apparently unaware of how to fix things. 

Arjen Robben, at least, didn't hold back in his criticism of the back line afterwards. 'We should not point the finger at each other,' he told SBS6 .

'But we have to speak to each other about the errors that were made. We have no security or stability at the back and we fall into repetition.' 

Hiddink wasn't helped when centre-back Ron Vlaar was forced off injured in the first-half, replaced by Stefan de Vrij, and the manager admitted they were threadbare at the back.

'It is true we are a bit thin on good defenders, especially after the new injury to Vlaar,' Hiddink said. 'I do not have many alternatives.'

Under Van Gaal, any defensive frailties were usually masked by exciting forward play but now they look profligate.

Both goals, from Sneijder and Daley Blind were spectacular, but Klaas-Jan Huntelaar was wasteful. At one point he missed an open goal from two yards out.

Robin van Persie, not quite fully fit and left out of the Mexico game with Sunday in mind, cannot return soon enough but he has been far from his best for Manchester United this season.

Memphis Depay, in excellent form for PSV Eindhoven, failed to sparkle for Holland and was removed for Quincy Promes on the hour.    

The crowd only became animated when Robben received the ball and many had already voted with their feet, with sections of the ground empty.

There were audible jeers when the teams walked off at half-time and after the Mexico goals. The Oranje optimism of the World Cup has long since evaporated.

But Hiddink has been here before. When first appointed Holland manager in 1995, he started with four losses from five, including competitive defeats to the Czech Republic and Belarus. They still made the finals, albeit via the play-offs.

In that first spell, Hiddink remained until 1998, leading Holland to the semi-finals of the World Cup in France.

This time round it may be a considerably shorter stay and under-fire Hiddink has already outlined his own exit strategy.
