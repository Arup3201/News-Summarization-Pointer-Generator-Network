They are not locations which normally feature in lists of the best places in Britain to live.

But a garrison town near Salisbury Plain, a bracing Cumbrian seaside village, a Glasgow suburb and an Anglesey village have been hailed among the country’s most desirable postcode areas in a report for Royal Mail.

Commissioned to mark the 40th anniversary of the roll-out of postcodes to every UK address, the study analyses each location by factors including job opportunities, housing affordability, health levels and crime rates.

England: The Wiltshire town of Tidworth, which is previously best-known as the birthplace of singer James Blunt and home of a polo club whose Patron is the Prince of Wales has topped a survey of the most desirable postcodes to live in

Scotland: Holmwood House, designed by celebrated architect Alexander Thomson, is in the G44 postcode - considered the best place in the country to live by Royal Mail

Wales: The rural idyll of Brynteg - which has a LL78 postcode - has been ranked the best place in Wales to live

Number one in England is SP9 covering the Wiltshire town of Tidworth, previously best-known as the birthplace of singer James Blunt and home of a polo club whose Patron is the Prince of Wales.

A thriving Army community among its 10,000-strong population, low crime rates and good transport links all helped it defeat the posh London suburbs and genteel market towns normally ranked among the best places to live but out of reach to many average earners.

Even the town’s mayor yesterday admitted the accolade would come as a shock to many people.

‘Outside Wiltshire, I think most people will say “Tidworth? Where’s Tidworth? I’ ve never heard of Tidworth”,’ said Christopher Franklin MBE, himself a former soldier who stayed put after leaving the Army.

‘Local people will probably be surprised too, but when they think about our location, plus the fact this is an affordable place to live with a very low crime rate, the reasons will become more apparent to them.

‘Hopefully this won’t just put Tidworth on the map, but it will also highlight the importance of it remaining a town with a garrison, rather than becoming a garrison with a town.’

Runner up: Yateley in Hampshire has been named as the second most desirable place to live in England

In second place in England was GU46 
covering Yateley in Hampshire, a small town off the M3 less than 50 
miles from Tidworth whose previous claims to fame include housing the 
former headquarters of the Official Monster Raving Loony Party.

Its
 quality of life has been recognised before – the local district was 
ranked top throughout the entire UK by Halifax Bank in 2011, 
highlighting high employment, good health and low crime.

Third place went to CA27, better-known
 as the small seaside village of St Bees, one of three Cumbrian 
communities to make the top ten, making it the best-represented county.

The
 site of a Norman priory and a 400-year-old private school whose 
ex-pupils include Mr Bean actor Rowan Atkinson, it remains popular for 
beach holidays despite its somewhat bleak location, while having high 
employment thanks to the proximity of the Sellafield nuclear 
reprocessing site.

In Scotland the top postcode is G44, which is the Cathcart area in the south side of Glasgow.

The
 area includes Cathcart Cemetery, the burial place of actress Madge 
Metcalfe, the mother of Stan Laurel, one half of the famous comedy duo 
Laurel and Hardy.

Postcodes in Erskine in Renfrewshire which is on the south bank of the River Clyde and the popular seaside resort of Largs on the Ayrshire coast make up the top three.

In Wales, LL78, the area surrounding the village of Brynteg on the Isle of Anglesey, is the top postcode. CF61 – the postcode for the small coastal town of Llantwit Major – is 
next most popular. This is followed by SY18 (Llanidloes), situated in 
mid Wales on the bank of the River Severn.

The study was carried out by the Centre for Economic and Business Research through analysis of factors including job opportunities, health figures, housing affordability, crime rates and the local environment.

Steve Rooney, head of Royal Mail’s Address Management Unit, said: ‘We commissioned the study to reveal the most desirable postcode sectors to live to mark the 40th anniversary of the allocation of postcodes to every address in Britain.

‘The invention of the postcode revolutionised the way post is sorted and delivered. As it has evolved, the postcodes have also revolutionised the way companies do business.

‘The postcode is now used by businesses and individuals in their everyday activities, whether that is verifying a person’s address when making a transaction or planning a route on a Sat Nav system.’

Postcodes were first trialled in 1959 to assist with mechanical sorting of mail but became universal in 1974. Today there are 1.8million postcodes in use across the UK, each covering an average of 17 addresses.
