The Co-operative Bank could go bust within months if it does not raise £400million, it was revealed yesterday.

The dire warning was contained in the bank's financial results, which showed a £1.3billion loss last year.

Directors warned that failure to find the cash to plug a hole in its accounts could affect its ability to continue as a 'going concern'.

Losses: The Co-op Bank could go bust within months if it does not raise £400million, it was revealed yesterday

Auditor KPMG said there was 'significant doubt' over the bank's future if it does not raise the funds.

If it did collapse, investors' money would be protected under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

It emerged yesterday that former directors and senior executives would miss out on £5million in bonuses because current management blame them for steering the bank to the brink of collapse.

Pay rise: Co-op Bank boss Niall Booker was paid £1.7million this year - and will get £2.9million next year if results improve

As its catastrophic results for last year were published the bank also issued an apology for its past failings and warned a return to any profit is unlikely before 2016.

Last year it failed to buy 632 Lloyds TSB branches when a 
£1.5billion hole was discovered in its finances.

But despite the huge losses, the bank admitted its current chief executive 
Niall Booker will receive a £2.9million salary for 2014, of which 
£1.7million is dependent on performance.

At the end of three years he would get a £1.2million bonus if the bank was profitable.

It also emerged in the annual report that Mr Booker was paid £1.7 million last year, including £943,000 as a fixed allowance 'that takes account of the broad range of specialist skills required of the role'.

The allowance is equivalent to £140,000 per month and is payable quarterly up until June 2015, the Co-op said.

He said on Thursday that there are still 'significant issues' that need to be resolved and he expects there will be further losses in 2014 and 2015.

Experts said that for such a relatively small bank the losses were 'truly shocking'.

The £5 million of withheld payments to former directors and senior executives relate to performance targets which have not been met as well as from some of the legacy issues at the bank.

Neville Richardson, the former 
Britannia boss, who took the helm of the Co-op Bank after its ill-fated 
2009 takeover of the building society, is among those likely to miss out on a bonus. 

Quit: Lord Myners' resignation on Thursday came just four months into his job, plunging the group into further crisis

Changes: The world's first Co-operative store was opened in Rochdale Lancashire in 1844 (pictured), but the now huge group has been led to the verge of collapse

The bank has repeatedly delayed the publication
 of its annual report twice until today due to the chaos both at the lender and at 
the Co-op Group.

Its crisis deepened further on Thursday with the sudden resignation of the former minister charged with dragging the troubled organisation into the 21st century.

Lord
 Myners, who was brought in to modernise the group, quit just four 
months into the job after facing opposition to his reforms.

Reverend Paul Flowers, the Co-Op Bank's former chairman, was exposed by the Mail on Sunday as buying crystal meth and crack coacaine

It
 came just a month after the chief executive quit branding the business
 'ungovernable' and leaves the Co-op struggling to repair its reputation
 after its banking boss Reverend Paul Flowers was exposed by the Mail on Sunday for buying crystal meth and crack cocaine.

Lord Myners will continue his review of the group but will no longer serve as an independent 
non-executive director, a role for which he is being paid a nominal sum 
of £1.

The review was launched after the 
Rev Flowers scandal and the discovery of a £1.3billion black hole 
in the Co-op Bank’s accounts.

Questions have been asked about why Rev Flowers was ever put in charge of the Co-Op Group's banking arm

But attempts to repair the group's finances - and reputation - have repeatedly faltered.

Last month Euan Sutherland, the Co-Op 
Group chief executive, resigned claiming senior Co-op officials 'talk 
the talk of reform, but in practice they won't do it' and the group was 'ungovernable'.

Rev Flowers’ drugs shame was revealed in an expose by the Mail on Sunday when the Methodist minister was covertly filmed counting off £20 notes to buy crystal meth and crack cocaine.

He had resigned as chairman of the Co-op Bank six
 months prior to the scandal, over criticism of alleged lavish expenses.

There have been repeated questions about how he was ever put in charge despite having almost no knowledge of the banking sector.

If you're fed up with your bank and thinking of switching to another provider, there are plenty of incentives to move.This is Money's five of the best current accounts is a regularly updated guide to where the best offers are.

Top deals include Halifax's Reward Account promising new customers £100 to switch and £5 per month if they stay in credit.

First Direct pays
 £100 to new customers who switch to its First Account. On top of that, 
the bank is so confident in its customer service that it will give you a
 further £100 if you chose to close the account within the first 12 
months.

Even if you are already a Santander customer, you could think about swapping to its 123 current account, which pays interest on in-credit balances
 - 1 per cent on balances between £1,000 and £2,000, 2 per cent between 
£2,000 and £3,000 and 3 per cent on balances between £3,000 and £20,000.

Nationwide BS FlexDirect offers to pay 5 per cent interest on balances up to £2,500 for the first year, while its FlexAccount delivers free travel insurance.
