Religiously slathering on sun cream on a hot day can be a time consuming process, but lifestyle guru Gwyneth Paltrow has an answer.

The mother-of-two and actress is selling a sun proof T-shirt in her Goop shop.

Describing the £27.49 ($45) Swim Tee by Land's End, she writes: 'Nobody wants to cut their beach time short - or exhaust an entire tube of waterproof sunscreen: It's pretty great to throw on a lightweight UPF 50 swim tee and not have to worry about getting a burn.'

The top, which is made from 91 per cent nylon and 9 per cent Lycra spandex, provides UPF 50 sun protection and the fabric is supported by The Skin Cancer Foundation.

Describing the garment on its website, the makers say: 'Protection from the sun is a priority, especially if you spend a lot of time at the pool or beach. And while cover-ups can go just about anywhere, the one place they can’t is in the water.

'But our Swim Tee is ready to dive in. Designed to wear over your swimsuit top, it’s soft as your favorite tee and incredibly lightweight - even while wearing it in the water! 

'It’s not just for swimming though. It also works as a colorful cover-up when the air turns cooler or you’re just looking to shade your skin.' 

While she's often criticised for regularly recommending outrageously priced luxury items on her lifestyle website,  Gwyneth wants her critics to know that she's just a regular girl.

The 42-year-old Oscar-winning actress recently insisted she's like all other women because, despite her fame, she still seeks the same things as others.

She recently told CNN Money: 'I'm incredibly close to the common woman in that I'm a woman and I'm a mother and we all are in a physical body with beating hearts with compassion and love we are all seekers...

'We all want fulfilment, we all want to live our best lives. We want to be healthy and happy and squeeze the most we can out of life. I think that's all women.'

The Iron Man star - who has children Apple, ten, and Moses, eight, with estranged husband Chris Martin - continued to say she is keen to be seen as a normal woman through her lifestyle website Goop, and not a 'guru' who professes to know all of the answers to people's problems.

She explained: 'What we try to do at Goop is curate and to edit. We know that a woman's time is her most precious resource and we want to multitask, get a lot done, and what we want to do is provide the best solutions.

Her lifestyle website, Goop, features everything from fashion to health and beauty advice

'I see myself as an actor and a mother and as an entrepreneur. I don't see myself as a guru at all. I'm not a guru because I'm the one asking the questions. I'm not purporting to know anything.' 

During a recent appearance on Bloomberg's Market Makers ahead of International Women's Day, the star said of the perception of her site: 'I think there is sometimes a miscommunication.'

'We aren't a super-luxury site, but we're aspirational. We have things on there that cost $4. We have things on there that cost $500. Sometimes I think that some of the criticism Goop gets is because people haven’t actually gone to the site and looked around and seen what we actually are.'

In 2011, the star admitted that the near-deafening criticism she faced over Goop prompted her to consider quitting the brand altogether.

'There were a couple of times when I thought, "I'm just gonna stop doing it. People are so mean to me. I don't want to do it,"' she told Harper's Bazaar UK.

'But then I was like, "Who cares what some lame person out there says?" I was in Italy once, and this old man came up to me and said, "I had the best time in Nashville because of Goop." And that is so worth it to me.'
