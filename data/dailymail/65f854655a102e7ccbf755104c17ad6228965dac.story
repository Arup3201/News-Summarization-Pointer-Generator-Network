Swimmers and surfers were forced to make a dash for the shore after multiple sharks were spotted at an iconic Sydney beach.

Lifeguards raised the alarm and cleared the water of swimmers to shut  Bondi Beach after sighting the shark near a 'huge school of fish in the water' on Monday afternoon.

Jet skis, speed boats and several helicopters scoured the famous Sydney strip before putting the flags back up and giving the beach an all-clear.

Surf Life Saving NSW spokeswoman Donna Wishart told AAP the Westpac rescue helicopter then flew over Bondi at about 3pm.

She said what was believed to be a shark, about 1.5 metres long, was spotted from the air.

Lifeguards later went out on jet skis and didn't see the shark, Ms Wishart added.

She said the beach had been reopened by 5.10pm.

'We called the helicopter in and they spotted a few others feeding off the fish,' he said.

'One was 3ft and the other was 5ft.

'There wasn't that many (people on the beach). We only have about 2000 people down here today, so it wouldn't have been anymore than a couple of hundred of people (to get out of the water).'

It comes just three days after a police helicopter spotted a bull shark just metres from the shore, prompting the beach to close for a few hours on Friday.
