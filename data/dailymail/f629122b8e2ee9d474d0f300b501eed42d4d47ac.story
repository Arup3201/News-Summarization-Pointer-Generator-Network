Swansea have offered £4.3m for Norwich left-back Martin Olsson but the Championship side want £5m. 

The Welsh club signed Kyle Naughton for £5m and want to sign Tom Carroll from Tottenham on a permanent deal also.

Olsson joined Norwich in 2013 when they were in the Premier League and the 26-year-old is keen for a return to the top flight.

Swansea manager Garry Monk wants Olsson to act as defensive reinforcement given he could lose full back Neil Taylor before February. 

Swansea are also continuing to negotiate with Tottenham over a deal for Carroll. 

Tottenham want roughly £5m for 22-year-old Carroll, who has impressed Monk during his loan spell. 

However, Swansea were hoping to bring him in for £3.5m with add-ons to follow.

The England Under 21 international does have interest from other Premier League sides but is enjoying his football in Wales where he has made 16 appearances and scored one goal.
