Loic Remy has blasted women he claims target wealthy Premier League stars to bankroll their lavish lifestyle after the Newcastle striker was cleared of gang rape. 

The France star claims the wannabe WAGs go after players because they know the stars are cash rich.

'These girls are vicious and greedy,' 
he told The Sun's Rachel Dale, in his first public comments on his ordeal since he was
 first arrested nine months ago.

'Nightmare': Newcastle striker Loic Remy has hit out of 'vicious and greedy' women who target footballers

Remy, 27, was one of three men last year accused of the champagne-fuelled 
gang rape of a 34-year-old woman at his rented flat in Fulham, west 
London.

He denied the allegation, and last month the Metropolitan Police finally said there would be no further action taken against him.

He admitted he should have been smarter, but added: 'When you're a footballer, single and want to have fun, you can have any girl you want.

'Before it was not like that. I see things that make me afraid. I see these girls - what they can do.'

Remy's accuser claimed that he, his cousin and his friend raped her on May 6 lat year, Bank Holiday Monday, at his £2million rented flat.

It was claimed the woman visited the fourth-floor flat where she was said to have been offered champagne before being raped.

After the alleged assault, it is understood the woman travelled to Kent where she reported the attack to police the following day. They in turn passed on the details to the Met.

Speaking of the moment police stormed 
his home, Remy said: 'When you are woken up at 5am by seven or 
eight police, you think it's a dream or a nightmare.'

The allegation has not damaged Remy's 
form on the pitch. While still on police bail, the striker moved from 
Queens Park Rangers to Newcastle on loan, where he has scored 13 times 
in 24 appearances.
