Thomas Muller is on his way to 'mullering' Gerd Muller and Miroslav Klose to become Germany’s greatest ever striker.

If Muller nets against France on Friday he will become only the third player in World Cup history to hit five goals at two World Cups.

It has previously been done by Peru’s Teofilo Cubillas in 1970 and 1978 and Klose in 2002 and 2006.

Heading to the top? Miroslav Klose need just one goal to become the outright leading World Cup scorer

Leading the way: Gerd Muller (centre) scores for West Germany against Australia at the 1974 World Cup

Indeed, at 24, Muller has possibly two World Cups left in him so could usurp Klose, who needs one goal to move clear of Brazil’s Ronaldo as the most prolific World Cup finals scorer with 16 goals.

It will take a lot for the modern Muller to beat Gerd 'Der Bomber' Muller's achievement of 10 goals at the 1970 finals. He added four in 1974.

Like Gerd, Thomas plays for Bayern Munich having come through the ranks and is not for sale.

James Rodriguez was rejected by former Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson four years ago when he first started to emerge as a force in Argentina.

United’s South American scouts identified 'James' as a future star but in the end Fergie opted for Javier Hernandez and Bebe instead.

So Rodriguez moved from Argentinian club Banfield to Porto in Portugal before moving on to Monaco.

He has been linked to a £40million move to United but, with injured fellow countryman Radamel Falcao being lined up by Real Madrid, he is set to stay for at least another season in France.

Manchester United allowed Paul Pogba to leave their academy and join Juventus after a wage dispute and won't pay the £60m being quoted to bring him back.

Chelsea are still considering a move for the 21-year-old Frenchman. But he is more likely to move to Real Madrid when Zinedine Zidane eventually takes over as boss - which may happen next year after he spends a year as boss of Real's feeder club Castilla.

That is if Paris St Germain don’t push out the boat this summer to sign Pogba, who is known by his French team-mates as La Pioche - 'The Pickaxe'.

If Brazil are to beat Columbia on Friday, then keeper Julio Cesar is likely to be as much their hero as Neymar.

It seems incredible that at the start of last season Cesar couldn’t get a game in the Championship for QPR.

Indeed he often didn’t make the bench behind much ridiculed former England keeper Rob Green.

But it wasn’t because Harry Redknapp didn’t rate him, it was just about getting him off the books given his £90,000-a-week salary.

Cesar is still technically a QPR player and the club are still paying around half his wages while he is on loan at MLS club Toronto.

He could return to QPR next season but the club hope his displays at this World Cup will convince somebody to buy him.

One to Watch:

It seemed when France axed Samir Nasri and then Frank Ribery was injured they would lack flair from the midfield or the flanks.

But Mathieu Valbuena - be honest how many had heard of him before? - has come to the fore and France have flourished with goals.

Creative spark: Mathieu Valbuena has been the driving force for France going forward

He has the been the main creative force of the team - and according to FIFA stats has teed up eleven chances

I-say:

German boss Joachim Low has said England will NEVER win the World Cup again.

He may have a point but may well have led the FA to a solution.

Who is the man who re-invented the German national team, helped Low on his way, then went over to the USA and turned their national team into a serious force? Jurgen Klinsman.

A German as England boss. Warum nichts?

Word Cup moment:

Tim Howard, according to the stat men, made 15 'saves' for the USA against Belgium - apparently a World Cup record since such things were first logged in 1966.

The great wall of America: Tim Howard pulled off a record number of saves for the US against Belgium

Whichever way you want to look at it, Howard produced the best all-round keeper display at the finals.

But Gordon Bank’s save from Pele’s header in 1970 surely remains the greatest single save.

World Cup Bet

Brazil and Germany are odds-on favourites to progress but the odds could be turned on their head.

Neymar insists he has the shoulders to carry the weight of the nation, but carrying the Brazil forward line - which he has done brilliantly so far - could well prove too much against this talented and spirited Columbia side.

And in James Rodriguez, Columbia have a player who can unlock a well-drilled Brazil defence.

A 1-1 draw at 90 minutes is 6-1. Columbia can then go on to win on penalties.

France versus Germany, meanwhile, has the making of a modern classic. So stick your neck out and trust Karim Benzema to keep on scoring. A 3-2 France win in 90 minutes is 45-1.

Odds from Coral.
