If you're a fan of football teams with obscure names, Christmas has come early for you.

There are plenty of brilliantly-named teams out there...take Argentinian side 'Club Deportivo Morón', for example. Or 'Botswana Meat Commission FC', known by their supporters as the Meat Men.

But now, following their promotion to the Finnish second division, there is a new contender. Meet FC Santa Claus.

The best club crest in football? FC Santa Claus' badge pays homage to everyone's favourite festive figure

Jaakko Paavilainen's goal was enough to secure promotion to the Finnish second division

Unless you're a big fan of Nordic football, it's unlikely you'll have heard of them until now, but the Rovaniemi-based side have just given their fans an early present with their table-topping season.

FC Santa Claus, who play in red and white (of course), secured their promotion to the Finnish equivalent of League One on Sunday, beating Rotuaarin Pallo 1-0.

The result clinched first place in the league for the Finnish side, who recorded 50 points from their 20 games - and 104 goals in the process.

They hail from the region claiming to be Santa's home - Rovaniemi, the capital of Finnish Lapland near the Arctic Circle - and are used a lack of football between October and April, as they are completely covered in snow.

Team spokesman Jouni Toyras has spoken of their successful season: 'We're happy to show people that we're in this for fun, but we also take it seriously as you can see from our fine result.'

A single goal from Jaakko Paavilainen was enough to secure the three points on Sunday, and thanks to a YouTube video from the club's official account, you can relive the moment the goal went in.

The goal, followed by wild celebrations, is also accompanied by some frantic Finnish commentary - it's clear the result meant a lot to the league champions.
