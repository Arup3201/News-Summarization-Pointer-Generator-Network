Transformation: Leslie Fabian writes about learning to love her husband after he changed his gender

Leslie Hilburn Fabian is a straight woman who married a man. But, over 23 years of marriage, she has convinced herself to become a lesbian - evolving her sexual preferences as her husband David became Deborah. 

When Mrs Fabian first met her husband in 1991, he was dressed as a woman at a party. Though he occasionally cross-dressed, he lived as a man - a successful New England surgeon - the rest of his life.

After years of marriage, however, she realized that David was yearning to do more than just wear skirts on the weekend; he wanted to become a Deborah - his female alter-ego full-time.

Mrs Fabian has written a book about how her partner's change in identity led to her changing her sexuality, as well. 'My Husband's a Woman Now: A Shared Journey of Transition and Love' was released in February. She detailed some of her trials in a column for the Washington Post today.  

Mrs Fabian says that she and her husband had an active sex life when they were first married. However, that eventually faded as David began to identify as a woman more. 

Mrs Fabian wrote in the Post: 'While my comfort with fantasy enabled me to support Deb’s presence in our bedroom, I sometimes longed for a scenario other than pretending we were both women during love-making.'

Eventually, David grew more depressed about his male identity. After 20 years of marriage and a parade of medication and psychologists for her husband, Mrs Fabian finally told him: 'I don’t think another therapist or a different antidepressant will work. It’s time to talk to an endocrinologist.'

At first the transition was difficult for Mrs Fabian. She said she refused to touch her husband's chest when he started sprouting breasts. The hormones he was taking sapped his libido. 

'There was no denying I was a “hopeless heterosexual,” as my lesbian sister once teased me. The sexual side of our relationship faded; I was losing my lover,' she wrote. 

But she says she leaned on the tender emotional connection that she and her partner maintained throughout their relationship to keep the relationship together. 

And now, three years after David came out as Deborah full-time, she says she had found new satisfaction in her marriage to a woman - and her new own new sexual identity as a lesbian. 

'We connect through deep discussions, mutual discovery and respect, caring and generosity. We focus on non-sexual ways of expressing love — cuddling, gentle caresses, holding hands. These interactions became more critical to our relationship than frequent sexual expression,' she writes.
