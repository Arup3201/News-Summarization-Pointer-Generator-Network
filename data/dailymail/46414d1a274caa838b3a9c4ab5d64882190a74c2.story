The family of a brain-dead, pregnant Texas woman says she has been removed from life support following a judge's ruling that a Fort Worth hospital was misapplying state law in the case.

A statement sent by lawyers for the husband of Marlisa Munoz on Sunday afternoon says she was disconnected from life support about 11:30am.

It says her body was released to her husband, Erick Munoz, and that the family is now looking to lay her to rest.

Mother: Marlise Munoz was already a mother of one. She was a few months pregnant when she suffered a blood clot and went brain dead

A judge had given John Peter Smith 
Hospital in Fort Worth hospital until 5pm Monday to comply with his 
ruling to remove Marlisa Munoz from life support, which Erick Munoz 
says is what his wife would have wanted.

J.R. Labbe, a hospital spokeswoman, issued a statement earlier Sunday saying the hospital would follow the order.

She was 14 weeks pregnant when her husband found her unconscious November 26, possibly due to a blood clot.

Both
 the hospital and family agreed before Wallace's ruling that Marlise 
Munoz meets the criteria to be considered brain-dead - which means she 
is dead both medically and under Texas law - and that her fetus, at 
about 23 weeks, could not be born alive this early in pregnancy.

Her attorneys revealed last week that the fetus was not developing normally, after being deprived of oxygen.

'According to the medical records we have been provided, the fetus is distinctly abnormal,' the attorneys said. 'Even at this early stage, the lower extremities are deformed to the extent that the gender cannot be determined.'

The attorneys said the fetus also has fluid building up inside the skull and possibly has a heart problem.

The
 case has raised questions about end-of-life care and whether a pregnant
 woman who is considered legally and medically dead should be kept on 
life support for the sake of a fetus. It also has garnered attention on 
both sides of the abortion debate, with anti-abortion groups arguing 
Munoz's fetus deserves a chance to be born.

Erick
 Munoz and his wife are both paramedics familiar with end-of-life issues
 and knew they did not want to be kept alive by machines in this type of
 situation.

Munoz described 
in a signed affidavit Thursday what it was like to see his wife now: her
 glassy, 'soulless' eyes; and the smell of her perfume replaced by what 
he knows to be the smell of death. He said he tried to hold her hand but
 can't.

'Her limbs have 
become so stiff and rigid due to her deteriorating condition that now, 
when I move her hands, her bones crack, and her legs are nothing more 
than dead weight,' Munoz said.

But
 the hospital argued it was bound by Texas law that says life-sustaining
 treatment cannot be withdrawn from a pregnant patient, regardless of 
her end-of-life wishes.

Legal
 experts interviewed by The Associated Press have said the hospital was 
misreading the law and that the law doesn't have an absolute command to 
keep someone like Munoz on life support.

Larry
 Thompson, a state's attorney arguing on behalf of the hospital Friday, 
said the hospital was trying to protect the rights of the fetus as it 
believed Texas law instructed it to do.

'There is a life involved, and the life is the unborn child,' Thompson said.

But on Sunday, the hospital said it would respect the judge's order and back down.

'The
 past eight weeks have been difficult for the Munoz family, the 
caregivers and the entire Tarrant County community, which found itself 
involved in a sad situation,' the hospital's statement says. 'JPS Health
 Network has followed what we believed were the demands of a state 
statute.'
