About eight thousand refugees fleeing violence in Syria have crossed into Turkey in the last 24 hours, a Turkish foreign ministry official said on Friday.

It followed an offensive by rebels, who have driven President Bashar al-Assad's troops from much of northern Syria, on a frontier town on Thursday night.

The rebels are now in control of a number of crossing points on the Syrian-Turkish border.

Their latest assault captured the town of Ras al-Ain, an Arab and Kurd town in the north-eastern oil-producing province of Hasaka, 600km (375 miles) from Damascus.

Ten people were killed in clashes as residents fled a few hundred metres across the border to the Turkish town of Ceylanpinar, according to unverified reports overnight.

'The crossing is important because it opens another line to Turkey, where we can send the wounded and get supplies,' said Khaled al-Walid, a commander in the Raqqa Rebel Division.

In the last three months, the mainly Sunni Muslim Arab rebels have captured a string of outposts on the 910km (560 mile) northern border, steadily moving towards the northeast which is home to many of Syria's one million Kurds.

However, the encroachments have enraged many Kurds, who want no part in the violence.

The Kurdish Council, a coalition of Kurdish parties opposed to Assad, called on the Free Syrian Army to leave Ain al-Arab, a border town of 54,000 people further west.

They said the clashes, as well as the fear of reprisals by the Syrian army, had prompted most of the town's inhabitants to flee.

'While the Kurdish Council affirms it is part of the revolution to bring down this totalitarian regime, the province of Hasaka must remain a safe area for thousands of refugees who had fled to it from other regions,' a statement said..

'Military elements have to pull out so their presence would not serve as an excuse to shell the town and destroy it.'

Adrian Edwards, spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, said in Geneva that there had been a 'large movement' of Syrian refugees into Turkey's Urfa province in the past 24 hours, a period co-inciding with the rebel offensive.

Turkey is already sheltering more than 120,000 Syrian refugees.

The Turkish state-run Anatolian news agency also reported that 26 Syrian military officers had also arrived in Turkey with their families overnight - the biggest mass desertion of senior soldiers from Assad's forces in months.

Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 12 people were killed by army shelling in the eastern town of al-Qurriya.

There were further clashes in the capital Damascus, with rebels and soldiers fighting in Kfar Souseh, a rich neighbourhood just a couple of miles from the presidential palace.

On Wednesday, rebels fired mortars at the palace but missed.

An opposition activist in central Damascus said police stations and state buildings had been fortified in anticipation of further rebel attacks.

'First we saw the most important buildings protected. Now we are seeing police stations protected,' said the activist, who asked not to be named for security reasons.

Damascus has become steadily more militarised as a result of rebel attacks and battles rage in pro-opposition suburbs.

The activist added that extra guards were posted months ago at security centres, the central bank and government offices. Concrete blocks had been installed in recent weeks.

The Syrian Observatory, which is based in Britain, said at least 38,000 people have now been killed since the revolt against Assad started 20 months ago.
