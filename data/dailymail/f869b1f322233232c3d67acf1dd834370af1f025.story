The successful search for the skeleton of Richard III has prompted calls for a fresh bid to locate the remains of another major historical figure buried in Leicester.

Cardinal Thomas Wolsey is known to have been buried at the city's abbey in 1530, but his bones have remained undiscovered.

The churchman, Henry VIII's Lord Chancellor, died at the abbey while travelling to London after being accused of treason when he failed to secure the annulment of the king's marriage to his first wife Catherine of Aragon.

At the time of his death Wolsey was arguably England's second most powerful person after the king.

The ruined abbey can be seen in Abbey Park close to the city centre.

Confirmation last week that a skeleton found under a council car park in Leicester in September, last year made the city the focus of media attention worldwide.

Thomas Wolsey (1473-1530) was arguably the most powerful figure during the first half of Henry VIII's reign.

He came from a relatively humble background and rose to become royal chaplain under Henry VII in 1507.

Two years later, the king died and was replaced by his son Henry VIII, who took a hands-off approach to governing which allowed the likes of Wolsey to build up unprecedented power.

After sidelining most of his rivals, Wolsey was appointed Archbishop of York in 1514 and Lord Chancellor the next year, propelling him almost to the very top of the hierarchy in both the secular and religious spheres.

He was also made a cardinal, cementing his position as the most powerful man in England after - or perhaps even including - the king himself.

As well as his political achievements, Wolsey left a very visible legacy in the form of his great home at Hampton Court and the foundation of Christ Church, Oxford - originally known as Cardinal College.

But his downfall came after Henry, who was desperate to end his marriage to Catherine of Aragon in order to wed Anne Boleyn, tasked him with seeking an annulment from the Pope.

When the annulment was not granted the king blamed Wolsey, seized his property and accused him of treason. The great cardinal died in Leicester on the way to his trial in London.

City
councillor Ross Willmott said: 'The discovery of Richard III is 
wonderful news, yet there remains something of a mystery about what 
happened to Wolsey, who rivaled Henry VIII in wealth and power and was 
one of the most significant political figures of the era.

'Arguably,
he is far more influential than Richard III. To discover his remains 
would help tell the story of another historic figure linked to the 
city.'

'There have been digs over the years to try to find him but they have not succeeded. I would like another go.

'It would bring more tourists to the city and further excite the interest in history and archeology that we are now seeing.'

Wolsey served as royal chaplain to Henry VII, who seized the throne after Richard was killed at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485.

It is likely he was buried with great ceremony at the abbey but historians think his tomb was destroyed later in Henry VIII's reign, when abbeys were dissolved in the late 1530s after England's split with the Catholic Church.

Attempts to locate Wolsey's remains during digs in 1820 and again in the 1930s drew blanks.

However, Leicester Civic Society chairman Stuart Bailey said: 'His bones may have been scattered and any remnants destroyed, but for years they said that about Richard III.

'I think it would be marvellous to have another look.

'It was a great fluke that Richard was found but we know Wolsey was buried in the Lady Chapel of the abbey church, which is not all that big.'
