Records of where tickets have been sold suggest the USA will have precisely 2,844 fans among the 45,000 due for each of the three days. Overall, 75% of the crowd is expected to be male, while fans are coming from 96 countries, the furthest being New Zealand.

A total of 45,000 fans are due to watch each day of the Ryder Cup

USA GO BATTY

Table tennis is taken so seriously by the Americans that Phil Mickelson brings his own bats. But the undisputed No 1 is Matt Kuchar, so good at lawn tennis that he once won the American amateur mixed doubles title with his wife Sybi.

WARM-UP STALEMATE

The USA may take it as a good sign that they won this week’s junior Ryder Cup 16-8. However, two weeks ago at nearby Stirling Golf Club, they staged the Fightmaster Cup for golfers with only one arm. Europe came out as 21-7 winners

ONLY FOUR FLYING SOLO

The Ryder Cup’s anachronistic practice of making such a display of players’ other halves will not affect four of the 24 competitors, who are single. Rory McIlroy, Martin Kaymer and Rickie Fowler are the most eligible bachelors in Gleneagles, while Graeme McDowell’s wife Kristin is at home after giving birth.

KEEGAN CARRYING BAGGAGE

A measure of how seriously American star Keegan Bradley takes the competition is that he has still not unpacked his Ryder Cup clothing after the acute disappointment of Medinah two years ago. The bag is sitting in his garage at home in Florida, and will be opened if they win this weekend. ‘It could be nasty,’ said the 28-year-old.
