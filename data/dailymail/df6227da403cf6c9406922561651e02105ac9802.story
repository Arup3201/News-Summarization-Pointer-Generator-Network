He is a reputed Colombo gangster who is serving a 50-month jail term for extortion.

But Giuseppe Destefano has asked for permission to travel out of state - to attend his 2017 wedding.

The convict, who is housed in Fort Dix, New Jersey, hopes he will have been released early for good behavior by the time he is due to wed his fiancée, Josephine Tanga, on New Year's Eve that year.

Based of this belief - which would see him living back in Staten Island, New York, under home curfew, by then - he has written to a Brooklyn judge seeking permission to travel 23 miles for the nuptials.

In a letter to Federal Judge Kiyo Matsumoto, Destefano, 36, explained how Miss Tanga has picked out Nanina's in the Park catering hall in Belleville, New Jersey, for their wedding and reception.

However, the luxury hall, nestled in extensive grounds, requires a nonrefundable deposit, paid two years in advance, according to documents filed in Brooklyn Federal Court.

'For this reason, and to make a fiancé (sic) who has been patiently and faithfully awaiting for my return - a happily married woman - I am respectfully asking your Honors permission to be able to schedule, reserve and make arrangements for my travel to the State of New Jersey,' Destefano wrote in his letter. obtained by the New York Daily News.

Despite Destefano's heartfelt letter, his request has so far been rejected by officials - because it is his based on his own assumption that he will be released from prison early for good behavior.

He has also failed to pay any of his outstanding $50,000 forfeiture judgement, it is alleged.

Yet he would be spending around $145 per person for the event at Nanina's, according to research by assistant US Attorney Elizabeth Geddes on the wedding destination site, weddingwire.com.

Destefano, a well-known member of the Colombo organized crime family, and Miss Tanga, who is believed to be an accountant, are planning to honeymoon in the Caribbean after their wedding.

The gangster is yet to submit a request seeking permission to travel out of the country for that.

Upon his release from prison, Destefano will be subject to a home curfew for six months, it is said.
