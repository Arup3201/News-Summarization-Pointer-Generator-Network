As Manchester United try to find room for the Class of ’92 in the new order at Old Trafford, they should perhaps be more concerned over the future of a more recent graduate of their academy.

It is hard to think of a more willing, less confrontational individual than Danny Welbeck. So when the 23-year-old England striker grows so unhappy that he considers leaving a club that has been part of his life since he was spotted by United at the age of eight, we should take notice.

Last month, sources close to Welbeck revealed that he was ready to quit Old Trafford after the World Cup with two years still left on his contract. Their claims, largely confirmed by an interview the player gave over the weekend, suggested that he had grown disillusioned under David Moyes.

Stay put: Manchester United must do all that they can in order to keep homegrown Danny Welbeck at the club

Problems: Welbeck felt like a 'victim' under the old regime, shunted out wide instead of playing centrally

He felt like ‘a victim’ of the new (now old) regime, they said, shunted out on to the left in a 4-2-3-1 formation that denied him the central striking role he prefers.

Welbeck was also alarmed to hear comments from Moyes in December saying that he needed to work harder in training.

The managerial change at Old Trafford might have headed off this particular crisis for now although, intriguingly, Welbeck refused to say if Moyes going would necessarily mean that he will stay. After all, Louis van Gaal is known to favour 4-3-3 and, for all his promise, Welbeck remains behind Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney in the pecking order for that central berth.

As United prepare to welcome their new first continental coach and more foreign signings this summer, they need to keep homegrown players like Welbeck now more than ever, and not just for the purposes of European football that will not concern the fallen Premier League champions for another year.

Ryan Giggs might have offered a glimpse into the future earlier this month when he gave first-team debuts to James Wilson and Tom Lawrence against Hull in his last home game in charge, but the days when local talent like Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and the Neville brothers seemed to roll out of the academy on a conveyor belt are a distant memory. It was a vintage year, 1992, but have there been any like it since?

What did you say?! David Moyes questioned the player's work rate in training while at United last season

Questions raised: Louis van Gaal prefers a 4-3-3 formation, which could be a struggle for Welbeck next year

Danny Welbeck may complain he was played out of position by David Moyes but his goals per game ratio was actually better under him than under Sir Alex Ferguson or Ryan Giggs

United can still bring through top talent. Some, like Adnan Januzaj, stay. Others, like Paul Pogba, move on. But Januzaj and Pogba only moved to Old Trafford at the age of 16 from foreign clubs.

Welbeck was brought up in nearby Longsight and joined at the age of 11. A local hero at a club whose proud history of producing players from within will forever be associated with the Busby Babes.

Across town at Manchester City, the club’s Abu Dhabi owners recognise the importance of local identity and are desperate for Micah Richards – Birmingham-born and raised in Leeds – to sign a new contract even though the defender only made two Premier League appearances last season. He is unlikely to oblige.

Of course, origin is of little importance without talent, but few would question Welbeck’s potential. He has come through United’s academy, paid his dues on loan at Preston North End and Sunderland, and established himself as first-team regular and possible World Cup starter for England.

Talent: Adnan Januzaj has started brightly at Old Trafford but was only brought to the cub when he was 16

Blooding: Tom Lawrence was given his chance by interim manager Ryan Giggs against Hull earlier this month

It has not always been easy. Of his 139 career appearances for United, 50 have come off the bench. Many more have been in that less preferable position out on the left.

Last season he only scored two goals, although it is worth noting that one of those came during a career highlight at the Bernabeu when Welbeck almost single-handedly had Real Madrid on the ropes with his power and pace.

Another 10 goals followed in 36 games for United in a difficult season under Moyes, but that still does not compare with Welbeck’s eight in 21 internationals for his country. ‘Maybe I’m kind of let off the leash a bit more for England,’ he admits.

Of all the promising young strikers on United’s books down the years (Wilson and Will Keane are the latest), none have come closer to becoming a true star than Welbeck. As he heads off to Brazil this summer with the best years of his career still ahead of him, that is something the club and Van Gaal should bear in mind.
