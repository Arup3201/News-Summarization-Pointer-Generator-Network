Rev Chris Briggs said the wearing of witch and Devil costumes over Halloween represents a 'far greater evil' than Nazis and terrorists

A church minister has said that the wearing of witch and Devil costumes over Halloween represents a 'far greater evil' than Nazis and terrorists.

Reverend Chris Briggs, from the Portland Methodist Circuit in Dorset, said parents would not allow their children to go door to door collecting sweets wearing Adolf Hitler or Islamic State fighter costumes but would allow them to dress as the Devil and witches. 

On his blog Ministerial Meanderings, he wrote: 'I want you to imagine a scenario: you hear a knock at the door and open it. 

'Outside, you see two small children with a beaming parent - after all, letting children go door to door in the dark is ridiculous.

'One young child is dressed as Adolf Hitler and has swastikas on their arm. 

'The other is dressed as an Islamic State fighter carrying an IS flag.

'I rather suspect that many people would think not only is this bad taste but celebrating such evil is highly inappropriate to say the least. I would agree.

'Yet we encourage children to dress as witches and the Devil and the like, deliberately encouraging dressing up as something that represents far greater evil.

'I think we have our values and standards back to front in this country.'

Mr Briggs added that Christians should shun Halloween as 'society would be better off if it avoided it'.

'One of the things that makes me very sad each year is the continuing growth and commercialisation of Halloween,' he said.

'Billed as a fun time by businesses that see a market opportunity to be exploited, youngsters and adults are encouraged to dress up in inappropriate costumes designed to scare people.

'One large store for instance is selling chainsaws with what purports to be dripping blood. 

'How amusing to open your door to see a six-year-old carrying that.

'Have we really taken leave of our senses? Others use this as an opportunity to justify vandalism and fear as eggs and flour are thrown at houses and, in some places, people - and not just old people - are terrorised.

'I make it plain where I stand. No Christian has any business encouraging anything to do with Halloween and society would be better off if it avoided it.' 

Instead of celebrating Halloween tonight, the reverend is throwing a 'Light Party', including a disco rather than traditional games, according to the Daily Express. 

Halloween is thought to have originated from the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, a day to mark the end of harvest and the beginning of winter - a transition that was believed to be a bridge to the world of the dead.

In the eighth century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to honour saints and martyrs and October 31 was known as All Hallows' Eve, which later became Halloween.
