If you are going to carry out an armed robbery, it is probably best not to put on your disguise in an alleyway covered by a CCTV system.

Two inept robbers, who threatened a man with a gun in central London, are being hunted by Scotland Yard after being caught on camera as they lay in wait for him.

The pair are clearly seen putting on their disguises before the robbery attempt in Shepherd's Market, in the capital’s upmarket Mayfair district in the early hours of the morning.

One of the men, who covers his face with a green bandana and the hood of his jacket, is seen holding a gun behind his back.

The robber is seen seconds earlier taking it from his waistband as he and his accomplice leave the alleyway and approach a nearby car. He was also seen putting on surgical-style gloves.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said a 37-year-old man who was parking his vehicle was approached by two men, one of whom pointed a handgun at him and said: "What have you got for me?"

The spokesman added: "The man ran off and alerted police. No shots were fired and he was not injured."

At the end of the CCTV footage, which recorded the robbery at about 2am on October 19, the two men are seen fleeing the scene.

The suspect with the gun is described as white and aged 18 to 21. His accomplice was a light -skinned black man and of the same age.
