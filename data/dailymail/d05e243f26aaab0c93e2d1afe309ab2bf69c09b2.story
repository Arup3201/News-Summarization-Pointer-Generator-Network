Sportsmail's  campaign to stamp out the wrestling, grappling and shirt pulling in the penalty area that's ruining our game continues.

Eliaquim Mangala was caught as the latest culprit of Sportsmail's 'Hands Off In The Box' campaign, when he was seen grappling in the penalty area with Newcastle United’s Paul Dummett as the Premier League champions stuttered at the Etihad Stadium.

Stoke centre back Ryan Shawcross and Brighton defender Inigo Calderon were also spotted manhadling their opponents during Wednesday night's Capital One Cup action. 

The HANDS OFF IN THE BOX campaign can successfully assimilate into the game yellow cards for holding in the box, so it’s not something out of the ordinary. Hold or grapple and you can expect to be cautioned – and sent off if you’ve been booked already. Once fans, managers and – crucially – players accept it as normal, this campaign will have achieved its aims.

Graham Poll, writing in one his recent Sportsmail column's said: 'Grappling and blocking in the box is THE No 1 issue I am asked about by football people. It used to be foul language (but it is seven years since a top-flight player was sent off for that offence) and then  goal-line technology (but that’s been dealt with effectively).

'It is time to now deal with grappling and holding in the penalty area. Tackling this issue is long overdue. It’s not about a change in the law, it’s about the appropriate enforcement of the law.'

Ahead of Manchester City's Capital One Cup clash with Newcastle, one fan backing our campaign claimed Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel is one of the worst offenders and said: 'Skrtel for me is probably one of the worst culprits for that sort of behaviour, although many teams are doing that sort of thing and it needs to be addressed.'
