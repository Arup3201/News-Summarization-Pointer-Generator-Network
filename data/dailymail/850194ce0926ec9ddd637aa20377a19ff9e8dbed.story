The morning after the night of The Jackal dawned brilliant and sunny over Belfast.

The only cloud on Carl Frampton’s horizon was the IBF’s insistence that the first defence of his world super-bantamweight title must be against a little-known American.

Britain’s newest world champion has secured himself not only a championship belt but also a rich range of options for mouth-watering title unification fights against stellar opponents.

But if Frampton wants to hold onto his first world title – ‘for a very long time’ as this 27-year-old puts it – it seems he must first accommodate mandatory challenger Chris Alavos.

Frampton and his mentor Barry McGuigan have a different wish list.

After Saturday near shut-out conquest of Kiko Martinez, they arrived at a late-night press conference with Frampton wearing a Father Christmas outfit.

The message to an IBF official in attendance in Belfast’s iconic Titanic Quarter was that a big-money duel with Leo Santa Cruz is more to their liking.

That Californian-based Mexican is McGuigan’s preference.

Frampton would like to settle a score with his English rival, WBA ‘regular’ champion Scott Quigg.

McGuigan – The Jackal’s promoter and manager as well as his inspiration – says: ‘Quigg can only draw about 800 fans on his home turf in Manchester but we could have another 16,000 crowd here in Belfast.’

That gathering to see Frampton score a landslide points victory over Martinez marked his potential as a cross-over star.

Not only is Frampton bridging the sectarian divide in Ulster – the way McGuigan did before him – but he is attracting a new generation of younger, non-boxing support.

Ulster is united behind him and McGuigan says: ‘Carl is becoming the greatest boxer in Irish history.’

Many hold McGuigan in that regard but the former world featherweight champion adds: ‘This young man is a better boxer than I ever was.’

A contemporary slant on Frampton’s prowess came from Sergio Martinez,the Argentian who is no relation to Spain’s Kiko but until recently the world’s outstanding middleweight.

One of the many celebrities at the open-air ringside in a temporary arena constructed on the slipway down which the Titanic was launched, Martinez said: ‘Frampton is the most exciting young fighter in the world today.’

He looked just that as he pummelled the other Martinez to comprehensive defeat by 119 points to 109 on my card, 119-108 in the view of two of the judges and 118-111 according to the third official.

Frampton is capable of adding further belts to his collection against Quigg and Santa Cruz. But if he must accommodate Alavos first then at least it will give him the chance to present himself to the American audience.

That situation has arisen because Martinez was granted a dispensation to earn bigger bucks in Belfast on condition that Alavos is given his shot at the winner with 90 days of negotiating terms.

McGuigan – well aware that this has much to do with the network television rivalry here between Sky and BoxNation – will bide his time after reporting that Frampton fractured his left hand on the resilient cranium of Martinez.

He had to keep punching away for the full 12 rounds because while the Spaniard resembled a bull being stuck by a picador, Frampton could not kill him off with a matador flourish.

Martinez is not lacking what the Hispanics call ‘cajones’ and after beating him here for the second time in 18 months Frampton told him: ‘I respect you more than boxer I’ve ever fought but forgive me for saying I hope I never see you again.’

Martinez had recovered from his first defeat in Belfast to win this title but Frampton has improved even more dramatically in the interval.

His hand speed while counter-punching was the key to keeping the aggressive Martinez at bay and he looks close to the finished article after only 19 professional fights.

A wariness of the Spaniard’s power stopped him going for the knock-out which the crowd bayed for their Jackal to deliver. But on an electrifying night they witnessed a very classy all-round performance.

The world, as well as Belfast, is now Frampton’s stage, whoever he fights in the coming months.
