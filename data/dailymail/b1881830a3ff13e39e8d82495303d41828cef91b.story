As she nears her 81st birthday, Joan Collins could have been forgiven for thinking about retirement.

But instead, the actress has stepped into a new role – as creator of a cosmetics range that’s flying off the shelves.

Products from her Timeless Beauty line for shopping channel QVC have proved so popular that many sold out within an hour of her first appearance this month.

Diva: Shopping channel QVC says viewers have rushed to imitate the look worn by Joan Collins

Familiar face: The star's appearance followed adverts for Snickers in which she poked fun at her reputation

A £23 foundation, a crystal compact 
mirror at £33, a lipstick for £25.50 and a £32 ‘eyelift in a bottle’ all
 proved best-sellers for Miss Collins, as viewers rushed to copy her 
glamorous Hollywood style.

And
 three subsequent shows on the satellite channel saw two other products 
sell out within the hour – a fragrance called I am Woman, priced at £21,
 and a £17 Fade To Perfect concealer.

Miss
 Collins has picked up a number of beauty tricks and tips throughout her
 lengthy career – including from Marilyn Monroe’s make-up artist Allan 
Snyder – and no doubt will have encompassed many into her 18-piece 
range.

Yesterday, QVC’s 
senior beauty buyer Sandra Vallow explained that customers were 
desperate to recreate the glamour of Miss Collins as Alexis Carrington 
Colby in Dynasty during her 1980s heyday.

She
 said: ‘Who wouldn’t want to own an Alexis lipstick? The QVC beauty 
buying team were so excited to be launching the Joan Collins cosmetics 
collection and it didn’t disappoint.

Star: Miss Collins, pictured with her new range, was named England's most beautiful girl at the age of 18

‘With six sell-out products it just shows that Joan’s glamour and beauty is inspiring for customers of all ages.’

Miss Collins was just 18 when she was voted the Most Beautiful Girl in England by the Photographers Association.

She
 made her name as a Hollywood star in her 20s, and went on to land the 
role of Alexis in 1981, when she was 48. Although the beauty range is a 
first for Miss Collins, she has also put her name to several popular 
novels she has penned.

Most
 recently she took part in a Snickers advertisement, in which she poked 
fun at her reputation for being a diva. And she has appeared in a number
 of other commercials, including one for high street retailer Marks and 
Spencer.

Her latest venture 
makes her one of a number of stars to have enjoyed success selling 
products on QVC, which has seen a turn-around in its fortunes from the 
days when it was dismissed as a poor alternative to the high street.

Career: The star was 22 when she left Britain for Hollywood and landed sultry roles in several popular films

Actress: Miss Collins later returned to the stage in 1980s and starred in a revival of Noel Coward's Private Lives

Now it is the world’s most watched television retailer and reaches 26million homes in the UK. Miss Collins will next be appearing on the channel on May 30 and May 31.

The star was 22 when she headed to Hollywood and landed sultry roles in several popular films, including The Girl in the Red Velvet Swing (1955) and Rally ’Round the Flag, Boys! (1958).

While she continued to make films in the US and the UK throughout the 1960s, her career languished in the 1970s, where she appeared in a number of horror movies.

Near the end of the decade, she starred in two films based on best-selling novels by her younger sister Jackie.

Returning to her theatrical roots, she also played the title role in the 1980 British revival of The Last of Mrs. Cheyney and later had a lead role in the 1990 revival of Noel Coward’s Private Lives.

She won a Golden Globe  Award for Best Actress in 1982  and received a star on the  Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1983 for career achievement.
