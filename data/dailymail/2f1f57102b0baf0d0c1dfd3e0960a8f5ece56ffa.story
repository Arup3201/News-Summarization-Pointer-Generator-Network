For those faced with a struggle, Captain James Arruda Henry's story is nothing short of inspirational.

The 98-year-old retired lobsterman has become a first-time author, having written and published his autobiography after learning to read at the incredible age of 91.

And his manuscript, entitled 'In a Fisherman's Language', even has Hollywood calling.

Incredible: James Arruda Henry, 98, reads an excerpt from his manuscript, 'In a Fisherman's Language'

As ABC affiliate WTNH reports, Mr 
Henry, of Mystic, Connecticut, spent most of his life without even his 
closest family members suspecting he was illiterate.

Forced to quit school in the third grade to take odd jobs, he kept the secret close to his chest - only confiding in his late wife.

Mr Henry's granddaughter, Marlisa 
McLaughlin, told the station how he used tricks, like waiting for others to order at restaurants first, or asking waiters how much he owed at restaurants, to avoid the issue.

A family dispute in his 90s, she said, sparked his initiative to reclaim his education.

A long-awaited re-telling: The book is a collection of stories about Mr Henry's life

Accomplished: Mr Henry opens a page of his book, which features many stories about his years as a lobsterman, including the loss of a fellow fisherman, Hank

'He signed a document he could not read about where he was going to go live,' Ms McLaughlin said, declining to offer further detail.

And then, after hearing about George Dawson, a 
son of slaves who learned to read at age 98 and went on to write a book 
of his own, entitled 'Life Is So Good' at age 101 - Mr Henry took up 
reading.

'I said if he can do it, I'm gonna try,' Mr Henry said.

Starting with his name, he eventually 
moved on to the ABC's and children's books.

He put them down for four 
years after the tragic loss of his wife. But eventually he went back to 
reading and with the help of his tutor, Mark Hogan, began to log his 
life.

A close secret: Mr Henry was forced by his father to quit school in the third grade and take odd jobs

In writing: Mr Henry's first hand-written letter, to his nephew Bobby, hangs on a wall in his home

Early days: A photo of Mr and Mrs Henry as young loves hangs in his home. She was the only person he had ever confided to that he was illiterate

As WTNH reports, he wrote about his family's voyage 
from Portugal to the U.S., how he went on to captain a lobster boat and 
serve on the National Guard, his many journeys at sea and how he was 
unable to save another fisherman who had fallen overboard.

He became a carpenter and a plumber, and even a professional boxer - and eventually built his own home in Stonington Borough.

Inspiration: Mr Henry was inspired by George Dawson, a son of slaves, who learned to read at 98 and published this book at 101

His life stories have become so 
popular, in fact, nearly 800 copies were sold in the first two weeks of
 the book's release last month.

One thousand more have since been 
printed as requests for the book flood in from as far as Germany. And now even Hollywood producers have 
approached Mr Henry about optioning the rights to his life story for a 
big screen adaptation.

According to WTNH, the family also now
 has a book agent and a deal in the works to publish a second edition 
that would include a hardcover version.

Ms McLaughlin said a textbook 
publisher has approached the family about featuring her grandfather's 
story in one of its books - and 
Kindle and Amazon want to offer an e-version.

Meanwhile, the family says they are reconnecting and closer than ever as a result of Mr Henry's late-life endeavour.

'Everyone has a story,' Ms McLaughlin 
said, adding of her grandfather's: 'It teaches that when you're down and
 out, never give up.'
