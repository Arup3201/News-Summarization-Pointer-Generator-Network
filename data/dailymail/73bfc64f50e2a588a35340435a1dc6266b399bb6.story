Two teenagers have died after they were thrown from the flatbed of a pickup truck after it lost control and flipped over several times.

Seven Lakes High School football star, 17-year-old Trent Weber, and Cinco Ranch High School sophomore, 16-year-old Terra Kubala, were killed in the crash in Katy, Texas on Saturday night.

The teens were in the back of the Toyota pickup truck with as many as eight other schoolmates as it drove to a bonfire, authorities said.

The 18-year-old male driver lost control, causing the vehicle to roll three times along Luna Vista Lane at around 11.30pm, KPRC reported.

Deputies say the driver, who has not been identified, and four other teenagers suffered significant but non-life-threatening injuries.

They say at least five teenagers were in the cab of the truck and as many as 10 were in the bed.

No charges have been filed against the driver but an investigation is being carried out by the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office.

After news emerged of the death, two separate vigils were held for the beloved teens on Sunday. 

Students gathered at the football field at Seven Lakes to remember Weber, the wide receiver for the Spartans. He was known as 'Spider-Man' because he could catch whatever was thrown at him.

Missed: School friends said that Kubala always had a smile on her face and improved everyone's day

'Everybody loved that kid, everybody loved him, everybody was his friend because he was so kind to everyone,' said Trent's teammate, Andy Garcia. 

Weber was a big brother to three younger siblings. 

At Cinco Ranch High School, more than 300 friends and classmates gathered to remember Kubala. Friends said she always had a smile on her face.

Classmate Teagan Schmidt told Fox26: 'She's just a ball of sunshine.'

'She always had a smile on her face and she was so much fun to be around,' added another friend, Natalie Nesbit.

Tributes: Hundreds of students gathered at the students' schools for candle-lit vigils on Sunday evening

Devastated: Classmates comforted each other as they remembered their friends on Sunday

Staff sent out emails to parents of children at the schools, KPRC reported.

'We ask that you please join us as we extend our deepest and heartfelt sympathy to the family as they mourn their loss,' it read.

'Grief counselors will be on campus on Monday to help our school community deal with this loss. We will be doing everything we can to help your child and our staff through this heartbreaking experience.'
