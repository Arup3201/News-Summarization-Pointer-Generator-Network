A man was arrested when police found he was carrying marijuana in a container attached with a label reading: 'Not Weed.'

Police officers in  Lincoln, Nebraska, stopped Jordan Meier, 21, while he was driving at around 9pm on Saturday for a traffic violation.

Officers then found the plastic sour cream tub with the suspicious sticker during a search of his car.

Police officers in Lancaster County, Nebraska, stopped the man's vehicle at around 9 p.m. Saturday.

The driver then acknowledged that the pot belonged to him.

He was arrested on suspicion of drunken driving and cited for having less than an ounce of marijuana.

A statement from Lancaster County Police read: 'A deputy sheriff stopped a vehicle for a traffic violation in Lincoln. 

'The deputy arrested the driver for DUI, an inventory search of the vehicle yielded a 16 oz Sour Cream container labeled with a permanent marker “Not Weed”. 

'The container contained 11.5 grams of suspected marijuana. The driver was cited for DUI and Possession of Marijuana, less than an ounce.'

In the state of Nebraska has decriminalized marijuana to some extent - which means a first offender will not receive a criminal record and will avoid prison time. 

It is treated like a minor traffic violation.  

However possession of less than one ounce is an infraction which is punishable by a maximum fine of $300.
