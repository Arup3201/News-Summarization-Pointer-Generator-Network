This is the heart-stopping moment a freestyle skier plunged off  the Matterhorn in Switzerland in a competition that rewards bravery.

Loic Collomb-Patton, from France, was captured dropping off the huge ledge in an effort to win one of the world's most prestigious skiing events.

The Skiers Cup sees Team Europe and Team Americas compete against each other at the end of February - and this year saw Europe win the title.

Freestyle skier Loic Collomb-Patton, from France, drops off a huge ledge while competing in the Skiers Cup in Switzerland at the end of February 

Skiers hit speeds of more than 60mph in temperatures around minus 15 degrees, meaning one slip could result in devastating consequences. 

As well hidden crevasses, cliffs more than ten metres high and deep powder, the competitors also had to battle with 40mph winds.

In one image Seth Morrison, the 42-year-old captain of the United States team, is captured pulling off a 30ft-long backflip making it the biggest and longest jump of the competition.

Intrepid photographer David Carlier captured the athletes on camera by using a helicopter to track the skiers from above.

Seth Morrison, captain of Team Americas, is captured upside-down as he attempts a backflip. The 30ft-long jump was the biggest and longest of the competition

Mr Collomb-Patton attempts the same jump but looks a little more unsteady on his feet as snow and ice tumble around him

Despite the athletes taking more than an hour in a chairlift to reach the peak of the mountain, whose summit is 4,478 metres (14,692 ft) high, they reached the bottom  in less than a minute.

Mr Carlier said: 'It is very unusual to have such an amazing group of riders ski on the Matterhorn at such a high level and in such great snow conditions.

'Actually, it has never been done before as this is the first time they could ski to the bottom of the Matterhorn, just under the North face.

'It was jaw dropping to witness the size of the jumps and the speed the riders reach in virgin, untracked, deep powder snow.

Mr Pehota, from Canada, tries to make his way down a near vertical cliff face. Team Americas has won the cup twice in five years

Dana Flahr, competing for the US, gets a huge amount of air as he jumps over a ridge just down from one of the mountain peaks

Cody Townsend is captured on two separate runs. Left, he attempts to navigate rocks after dropping off a ledge. Right, he keeps his cool on a vertical cliff face

Competitors make their way towards the peak of the Matterhorn. It takes more than an hour in a chairlift to reach the peak but less than a minute to come down

'It requires so many skills to perform freestyle tricks in such an uncontrolled environment.

'It takes only one hour from the last lift to reach the start of the contest but then it takes them less than a minute to go down.'

Nicolas Hale-Woods, freeride world tour general manager, said: 'The level of skiing is amazing – but what strikes me most is the good spirit between the teams. 

'It has been really interesting to witness how the guys helped out each other. That's the spirit that makes this event so special and we will do our part to keep it that way.'

Europe has won the crown three times, with America taking home glory twice.
