Excuses can’t be made anymore for Roberto Soldado’s poor performances, says former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood.

Sherwood believes the striker – who missed a penalty in Tottenham’s 4-1 defeat at Manchester City – has had enough time to adapt to English football since his £26million move from Valencia last summer and must start delivering.

Sherwood also said that youngster Harry Kane is a better player than the Spain international.

'In my opinion Harry Kane is better than Roberto Soldado,' Sherwood told BT Sport during his post-match punditry analysis.

'I chose Kane last year as he was consistently performing better in training.

'He [Soldado] needs to start producing on the field and we can't make excuses for him anymore.

'He should be settled in at the club after living here for over a year.'

Soldado was given a rare league start by current boss Mauricio Pochettino in their 4-1 defeat at City on Saturday.

With the score at 2-1 to the hosts, Soldado missed a penalty that would have levelled the match in the second half. Minutes later Sergio Aguero extended City's lead in a game-defining few moments.

The Spain international was expected to be a hit in north London following a glut of goals at his former side - after netting 80 in 146 appearances.

However, since coming to Tottenham Soldado has failed to live up to expectation at the club with the much-maligned forward scoring 13 goals in 43 appearances for Spurs and his performances seeing him fall behind Emmanuel Adebayor and Harry Kane in the pecking order.

This season the 29-year-old has made seven appearances for Spurs this season, scoring two goals.
