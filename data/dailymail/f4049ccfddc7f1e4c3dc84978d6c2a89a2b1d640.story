Simon Danczuk MP says the Rochdale Council inquiry into wrongdoing at Knowl View school is a 'whitewash'

An MP who helped expose the late Cyril Smith as a paedophile has criticised council bosses, calling their inquiry into a school where boys were abused a ‘whitewash’.

Rochdale Council is looking into its dealings with residential school Knowl View, where boys as young as seven were abused by the Liberal MP Smith and his cohorts.

But MP Simon Danczuk – whose revelations in his book Smile for the Camera: The Double Life of Cyril Smith were serialised in the Mail last week – has called the inquiry a ‘bogus’ exercise designed to exonerate the local authority of any wrongdoing.

He went on to say: ‘I don’t know why they’re calling it an independent review because the council commissioned it, they’ve set the terms of reference.

‘It is a whitewash. There is nothing independent about it and I think it is wrong that the council should be investigating serious allegations of abuse that they had responsibility for preventing.’

Whistleblower Martin Digan, the former head of care at Knowl View, has said the Rochdale school was like a ‘sweet shop for paedophiles’.

And Greater Manchester Police revealed that two more alleged victims of abuse at the school came forward following the serialisation of Mr Danczuk’s book in the Mail.

A spokesman for the Labour-run council, which was Tory-led when the allegations were first aired in 1979, said: ‘Like the police, we continue to ask anyone with information to come forward.

‘This administration is treating the historic allegations very seriously. We are being completely open and transparent.’

Mr Danczuk says he is considering using parliamentary privilege to name a former senior politician who allegedly had sex with boys at the Elm Guest House in Barnes, South-West London.

He said: ‘It would be best for him to come forward of his own volition, but I would consider using privilege to name him.’
