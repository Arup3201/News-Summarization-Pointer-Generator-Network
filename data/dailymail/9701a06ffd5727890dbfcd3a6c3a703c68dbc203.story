Smiling at the camera and posing happily together, these people seem the epitome of the all-American family.

However, everyone in the remarkable set of portraits are complete strangers who have only just met.

The series of images, called 'Constructed Family Portraits', were taken by photographer Jamie Diamond.

Family ties: They might look like they've known each other all their lives but this ideal-looking family portrait is really made up of perfect strangers

The New York-based photographer advertises for volunteers through Craigslist before putting random groups of strangers together for the 'family portraits'.

The artificial families meet up in hotel rooms or public areas where they are arranged as relatives.

She arranges the groups in convincing poses and many look like they could be related.

The wholesome portraits include a man
in dressed in what appears to be military uniform standing next to two 
women who could be sisters.

In another, a smiling 'family' dressed in white gather around a woman who could be the matriarch of the household.

Some stand in front of the American flag and most look like they have dressed up for the occasion.

Diamond said her pictures aim to challenge 'the public image of the family'.

She writes on herÂ website: 'I construct situations and events for 
the camera that deconstruct family identity and structure and in so 
doing explore themes of photographic truth, gender, class, culture and 
identity.

Three generations: Mother, father, daughter and granddaughter... or are they?

Themes: Photographer Jamie Diamond says her work deals with 'alienation, interaction and group identity, often in relation to social and gender based conventions and stereotypes'

'My work deals with alienation, interaction and group identity,
often in relation to social and gender based conventions and 
stereotypes.'

She said the way position of people gives them an identity in the artificial families.

Diamond, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and fellow at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, said her work 'questions' the difference between authenticity and artifice.

She wrote: 'The portraits are of actual people being 
themselves in an entirely new context; they intuitively follow the rules
of the genre and the group they form for the camera ascribes them an 
identity.'
