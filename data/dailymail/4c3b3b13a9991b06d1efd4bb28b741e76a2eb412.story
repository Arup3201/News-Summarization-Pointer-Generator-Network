Three years after scientists made the astonishing discovery of a large prehistoric spider fossil in China, the same team have uncovered another.

The original female fossil, found in the Daohugou beds of Inner Mongolia in 2011, was so well preserved experts claimed it was part of the Nephila species.

Yet the latest discovery of a similar-sized male fossil casts serious doubt over this theory because its relative size doesn't fit the Nephila mould.

In fact, the researchers were so baffled by the differences, they have proposed a new genus called Mongolarachne, to describe the creature.

The fossil of a male spider, pictured, was found on the site of Daohugou in Inner Mongolia. It was discovered in the same place as a female spider fossil from 2011. Spider fossils are rare because their bodies are soft, yet this pair was found in volcanic deposits and may have been buried at the bottom of a lake

Back in 2011, the 165-million-year-old female spider was dubbed Nephila jurassica.

Experts made this conclusion because the fossil is roughly the size of modern-day Nephilidae, or orb-weaver spiders - with a body
 one-inch long and more than half an inch wide, and legs that stretch to
 2.5 inches.

The females in this family are large, but the males are relatively small in comparison.

Although the male fossil looked similar to the Nephila jurassica, it wasn't that much smaller than the female, with a 0.65-inch long body, and legs that stretch 2.29 inches.

Its sex appendages, between its jaws and legs, also did not match those seen on modern-day Nephila males. 

It was also said to have 'spirals of hairlets' that were more feathery than those seen on orb-weavers.

This led Professor Selden and his team to propose a new genus, Mongolarachne of the family Mongolarachnidae to describe the creatures.

Professor Paul Selden from Kansas University was part of the research team that discovered both fossilised spiders. 

Spider fossils are rare because their bodies are soft, yet this pair was found in volcanic deposits and experts believe these deposits may have buried the pair at the bottom of a lake, perfectly preserving them.

Back in 2011, the 165-million-year-old female spider was dubbed Nephila jurassica. The Nephila genus is also known as Golden orb-weavers.

The fossil is roughly the size of the spider's modern-day descendants, with a body one-inch long and more than half an inch wide, and legs that stretch to 2.5 inches.

The females in this genus are the largest web-weaving 
spiders alive today, with a body length of up to 2 inches and a leg span of 
6 inches. Males are relatively small in comparison.

While the male fossil looked similar to the Nephila jurassica, its size and shape suggested otherwise.

Firstly, it wasn't that much smaller than the female, with a 0.65-inch long body, and legs that stretch 2.29 inches.

Its sex appendages, between its jaws and legs, also did not match those seen on modern-day Nephila males. 

It was additionally said to have 'spirals of hairlets' that were more feathery than those seen on orb-weavers.

Researchers named the female, right, Nephila jurassica because of its likeness to the Nephila species of golden orb weavers. Yet the size of the male, left, contradicts this. Researchers now believe the species more closely resemble ogre-faced spiders and have proposed a new genus called Mongolarachne

This led Professor Selden and his team to propose a new genus, Mongolarachne of the family Mongolarachnidae, to describe the creatures.

According
 to findings reported in the journal Naturwissenschaften, Monogolarachne
closely resemble modern-day ogre-faced spiders, of the Deinopidae
 family.

The
 spider was dug up at a site called Daohugou in Inner Mongolia that is 
filled with fossilised salamanders, small primitive mammals, insects and
 water crustaceans. 

During the Jurassic era, the fossil bed was part of a lake in a volcanic region.

The size and shape of the female led researchers to categorise it as a descendant of the golden orb weaver spider, pictured left. In this species the male is significantly smaller, yet the fossillised male was a similar size to the female, leading experts to claim they would have more closely resembled ogre-faced spiders, right
