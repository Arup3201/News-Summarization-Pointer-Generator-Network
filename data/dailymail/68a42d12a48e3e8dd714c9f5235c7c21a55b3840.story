Killer: Kiaran Stapleton who has admitted shooting dead an Indian student on Boxing Day. He admitted manslaughter but denies murder

A man has admitting killing Indian student Anuj Bidve who was shot dead in the street in the early hours of Boxing Day.

Kiaran Stapleton, 21, pleaded not guilty to murder when he appeared before a court today but pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Mr Bidve, 23, a post-graduate microelectronic student at Lancaster University, Mr Bidve, had travelled to Manchester with a group of friends to visit the Boxing Day sales.

He was walking with his friends from his hotel in Trafford Park to the city centre when he was approached in Ordsall, Salford and shot at close range.

He suffered horrendous injuries and was rushed to hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

The defendant gave his name in court as 'Psycho Stapleton' when he first appeared before magistrates in the days after the shooting.

Following Mr Bidve’s death, a candlelit vigil was held by members of the local community and his parents, Subhash and Yogini, travelled from India to visit the spot where he died.

During their visit, the couple said they did not hold the people of Salford to blame for the crime, only the person responsible for their son’s death.

A peace rally was also organised in New Delhi, India and hundreds of people took part in a march through the city to the British High Commission.

Mr Bidve had been studying for a 
micro-electronics postgraduate qualification at Lancaster University 
after completing an a degree at Pune University in India.

Victim: Anuj Bidve who was shot dead in Salford on Boxing Day

Stapleton, who was wearing a grey jogging top and bottoms, appeared at Manchester Crown Court where he denied murder.

He was flanked in the glass-framed dock at Manchester Crown Court by four security guards for the duration of the 15-minute hearing.

Mr Bidve’s parents, Subhash a former Indian Air Force pilot, and Yogini, who runs a courier company, travelled over 4,000 miles from their home in Pune, India, to see the man accused of murdering their son.

They sat to the right of the dock, out of sight of the defendant for the hearing and afterwards admitted it was ‘an emotional and difficult time.’ They listened intently as Stapleton of Ordsall, Salford gave his pleas and was remanded in custody ahead of the trial later this month.

Following the hearing, Mr Bidve’s family said in a statement: ‘We have made the journey from India to the United Kingdom because it was very important to us to hear, in person, Kiaran Stapleton’s plea.

‘This is the first time we have returned to the UK since Anuj was taken away from us on Boxing Day of last year, and the first time we have come face to face with the man charged with his murder, so clearly this is a very emotional and difficult time for us.

‘We have heard in person that Kiaran Stapleton admitted killing Anuj. We know there is tremendous amount of interest from the media both at home in India and here in the United Kingdom.’ Judge Richard Henriques QC banned reporting of Friday’s proceedings other than the pleas. The trial is due to be heard starting on June 25.
