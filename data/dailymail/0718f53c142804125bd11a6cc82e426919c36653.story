Almost a third (31 per cent) of 18-25 year-olds have had a sexual encounter with someone they met through an app or social networking site

A new survey has revealed shocking statistics that show the damage so-called hook-up apps may be having on the sex lives of young Brits.

Apps like Tinder and Grindr are geo-social networking applications supposedly geared towards finding a lover or relationship.

But many users reveal they have the apps - and traditional social networking sites like Facebook - just to  find instant sex partners.

Almost a third (31 per cent) of 18-25 year-old's who responded to the questionnaire admitted having a sexual encounter with someone they met through an app or social networking site.

On average, a young person who used one of these apps had three of these encounters.

The most unrestrained admitted having up to 80 sexual partners this way.

Londoners are the most promiscuous; nearly 40 per cent of young people living in the capital admitted to the having sex with someone they met on social media.

Scots are the most reserved, with less than half as many young adults (17 per cent) opting 'yes' when it comes to having a hook-up north of the border.

But while young people are finding it a lot easier to access sexual partners, it appears to be making them worse in bed.   

Respondents were asked to rate their experience between the sheets, and compare it against sex with a frequent partner.

The hook-up partner scored lower across the board on duration, excitement, comfort and overall satisfaction. 

And the decline in quality has resulted in almost half (47 per cent) of 18-25 year old females admitting that they fake orgasms.

Conversely, one in four 40-50 year olds, who have grown up without the instant sex apps, boasted that they were able to experiment with their partner more than when they were younger and their sex has got better as they've got older. 

A spokesperson for intimate toy retailer Bondara, who commissioned the research, said: 'From UK festivals to far-flung foreign lands, it is now possible to arrange an illicit liaison through a smartphone.

'However, while hookup apps such as Tindr, Grindr, Bendr and 3ndr are increasing the quantity of sexual experiences, the quality is suffering. For many people there are huge benefits to fleeting, no-strings-attached encounters - but great sex is seldom one of them. 

'If you are looking for the most pleasurable experience possible, you should put down the phone, pick up some roses, and ask that friend or colleague you fancy for a traditional date.'
