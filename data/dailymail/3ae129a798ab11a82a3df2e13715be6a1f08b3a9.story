Lewis Hamilton has revealed he felt awkward when rival Nico Rosberg was booed for the second successive race.

After he was taunted at the Belgian Grand Prix following his crash with team-mate Hamilton, the boo boys were out in force again for Rosberg on Sunday.

The German, who finished second behind Hamilton at the Italian Grand Prix, was jeered during his interview with former Ferrari driver Jean Alesi on the podium.

Jeers: Championship leader Nico Rosberg was booed on the podium for the second successive race 

Off track: Rosberg lost the lead of the race to Lewis Hamilton on lap 29 after his error at Turn One 

‘I felt a bit awkward when they were booing Nico,’ said Hamilton in the wake of his victory in Monza which sees him close the gap to Rosberg to 22 points in the drivers’ standings.

‘I don't like that in sport. After the race and when we get out of the car everyone should be nice to each other.’

Despite the strains of their title battle, which flared up last month in Spa after Hamilton and Rosberg collided on the second lap, the 29-year-old Briton insists he remains on friendly terms with his team-mate.

Straight on: Rosberg was forced to take to the escape road after his costly error 

Asked if they were friends again by Alesi, Hamilton replied: ‘Of course. We're team-mates, always will be.’

Hamilton’s latest remarks are in stark contrast to his comments after the Monaco Grand Prix in May in which he said he and Rosberg were 'not friends' but 'colleagues'. 

Hamilton was furious after he believed Rosberg had deliberately scuppered his final lap in qualifying by running off the road.
