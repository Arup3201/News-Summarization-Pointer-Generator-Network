The law professor who was shot dead earlier this month, was talking on the phone when his killer followed him into his garage, it has been revealed.

As Florida State university professor Dan Markel pulled up to his Tallahassee suburban home in his black Honda Accord, he told the person on the line that someone was in the driveway, sources told ABC News.

Just moments later, the killer followed Markel into the garage and hit him with a single gunshot to the jaw and the 41-year-old was pronounced dead just a few hours later.

A neighbor heard the gunshot and called 911, telling authorities about a silver Toyota Prius seen fleeing the scene.

Markel's murder has so far baffled police and surprised family and friends who claim the loving father-of-two had no enemies to speak of and had just begun a new relationship after a painful divorce.

However, the targeted nature of his killing has led to some speculation about whether he was the target of a contract killing.

The scholar, who was buried in his hometown of Toronto on Thursday, had his critics.

Thirty-six
 hours before he met his killer, 41-year-old Markel's thoughts were 
firmly fixed on his most passionate cause, the death penalty, posting an
 essay on the subject to his legal blog.

Questioning
 the acceptable rate of errors in death penalty cases, Markel's piece 
was posted to his widely read PrawfsBlawg on the evening of July 16.

It was on this blog that Market was the subject of a threatening post a few years ago

According to the Miami Herald,
 Markel was the subject of an anonymous threatening post, that taken out
 of context can seem ominous, but in fact was only a small part of a 
wider academic argument.

'Bullies
 like this need to be made radioactive,' writes the poster, annoyed at 
perceived deletion of posts by Markel on PrawfsBlawg.

'Their arrogance and imperiousness speaks for itself. All means necessary must be employed.'

According to the Miami Herald, a Florida State spokeswoman would not confirm or deny whether Markel reported this to the university.

Described
 as a devoted father to his two sons, Benjamin, five, and Lincoln, four, 
Markel was called 'Abba' by them, Hebrew for father.

'The house was like a playpen,' said one of his students, Ryan Wechsler to the Miami Herald.

Indeed, by all accounts, the fiercely 
intelligent scholar's most important struggle to date was no different 
from many others - that of a father trying to keep his family together.

Markel's happy home was turned upside down in September 2012 when Adelson filed for divorce.

Tragedy: Ex-wife Wendi Adelson with the couples two sons. She also teaches at Florida State University and is said to be distraught at the death of her children's father

Separation: Dan Markel and his wife Wendi split two years ago and their divorce was finalized in July of 2013

As
 the case moved through the courts, Markel's attorney's claimed that 
their client was stunned and that Adelson had upped and left the home 
with their children while he was away for a short business trip.

According to the Miami Herald, Adelson tried to move south from her job as a professor, also at Florida State University, to a private law firm.

A judge denied this and their custody issues were still ongoing at the time of his death.

For her part, Adelson, through her attorney's has spoken of her total and absolute shock at the death of her ex-husband.

Indeed,
 the unexplained and clinical nature of the murder has reportedly left 
her frightened for her safety and that of her children.

according to his friends who have been left bewildered and scared by 
their friends death

Her 
attorney, Jimmy Judkins has said Adelson is in 'shock' and reiterated 
that she knew nothing of the killing and had spoken to police already.

'She
 is probably more curious about what happened than anybody because while
 the police said he was targeted, at one time, it was her house, too,' 
he said to the Miami Herald.

'It’s just discomforting to her. She’s worried for her children.'

New York University law professor Rick Hills told the Toronto Star that he last saw Markel when he came to stay in Manhattan two weeks before his death.

Hills
 revealed that the Markel was moving on in his life and was now happy in
 a new relationship with a woman after going through his divorce.

'He was rebuilding his life after a really, really difficult period,' Hills said.

'I was watching him as he was in my apartment Skyping his kids and saying goodnight on his cellphone … he was so happy.'
