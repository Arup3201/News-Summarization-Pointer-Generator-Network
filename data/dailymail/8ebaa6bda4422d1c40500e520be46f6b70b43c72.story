Peter Howes, 53, (pictured with his wife Jane) has been found guilty of cheating his brother out of a £1.5million inheritance

A jealous son has been found guilty of faking his family member's signatures to cheat his older brother out of a £1.5million inheritance - because he was fed up with him being the 'favourite'.

Peter Howes, 53, resented his brother Jonathan moving to Hong Kong and then Singapore - leaving him to look after their ailing mother - so he siphoned off cash from their parents' estate.

Howes, as an executor to a number of trusts and settlements, wound them up by forging the signatures of his mother Joyce, or 55-year-old brother Jonathan.

He also cashed in two life insurance policies, worth just under £100,000 altogether, before pocketing the money.

The family estate should have been split equally between Howes and his brother, but he transferred cash into a joint account, set up between himself and his mother, then moved it into a sole account in his name.

The cash was then handed to former partners and was used to buy a 40 per cent stake in an online gaming company, set up by a relative of his wife.

But the ploy unfolded when Joyce died in November 2011 aged 81. Jonathan discovered his brother's deception during a conversation with family lawyers about funds.

Howes was arrested and charged with four counts of fraud. He was also jointly charged with his wife Jane, 51, on another.

Yesterday a jury took just three and a half hours to return guilty verdicts on all five counts. They found his wife not guilty.

Ed Burgess, prosecuting, told the four-week trial: 'It is a sad case because it is a case about a breakdown in a family, and who knows what lies behind it.

'Peter Howes may well have thought, "my brother is off living his life in Hong Kong or Singapore, I'm stuck here with mum, I will take what I can get my hands on".

'Particularly if he has some money to settle with former partners and particularly if he wants to make some money out of online gambling.

'There is some talk of Jonathan always being the favourite son, and Peter and Joyce having a very difficult relationship.

'But what is overwhelmingly obvious in this case is that he practised deceit, in one case he was knowingly assisted by his wife in order to take money he knew he was not entitled to, otherwise he would not have behaved as he did.

'Effectively Peter Howes was taking for himself all of her [Joyce] money in the last days of her life, although he knew full well that it was her intention that both the boys should benefit equally from their hard earned money.

'The total sums are just in excess of £1.5million.'

Bristol Crown Court heard Howes first came into contact with the family accounts when his father Thomas, set up a number of trusts in 2002 - shortly before he died.

A letter was sent to both brothers where they were told proceeds of the estate, upon the deaths of both Thomas and Joyce, 'should be divided equally between them'.

Howes was given the responsibility for dealing with the administration of the trusts following his father Thomas' death in August 2004.

He wound up one settlement, giving half the proceeds, some £109,000, to his brother in Hong Kong, convincing him the rest of the money was still in the trusts.

But Howes began to look into other accounts where he faked his mother's signature on an Aviva document enabling him to access the money, before purporting she had signed another to close a settlement.

Bristol Crown Court heard that Howes, as an executor to a number of trusts and settlements, wound them up by forging the signatures of his mother Joyce, or 55-year-old brother Jonathan

The court was told that Jane Howes, knowing about the deception, then countersigned the settlement document, so the money would be released.

Around the same time Joyce suffered a fall at the family home in Bexhill-on-Sea, Essex in 2009 and her health deteriorated dramatically, forcing her to move in with the couple in Lechlade, Glos.

Howes quickly set up an online joint account, and transferred all the proceeds of the policies and settlements into it.

Bank statements later show the money being moved to an account in his name only before being withdrawn as cash or cheques.

Howes set in motion plans to sell the childhood house, and once he had received permission from Jonathan, via email, sold the home for £1.075million, moving all the money from the sale from Joyce's account into the joint e-saver.

Jonathan never received proceeds of the sale.

'This is not a case that a woman who had lost her mental faculties was exploited,' Mr Burgess told the court.

'Mentally, although difficult and showing inadvertent signs of ageing, Joyce was competent, which explains why Peter Howes felt it necessary to resort to fraud, including forging signatures, in order to get his hands on the money to which he was not entitled to.

'This e-saving account was really a vehicle through which Peter Howes enabled himself to get his hands on his mum's money.

'Joyce's various personal accounts were almost always running at a very small balance, and whenever a very significant amount of money was credited it was immediately received to the joint account before it was removed by Peter for his own gain.'

It was only when Joyce died, on November 14 2010 and emails were sent between the family solicitor and Jonathan regarding family trusts, that he discovered what his brother had done.

The court heard independent handwriting experts had confirmed the signatures were not those of Joyce, or Jonathan Howes, something Howes does not deny.

The case has been adjourned for sentencing at a later date.
