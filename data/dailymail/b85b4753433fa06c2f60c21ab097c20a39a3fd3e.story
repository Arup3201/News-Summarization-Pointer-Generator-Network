Google has removed yet another series of MailOnline articles from its search results - detailing drug abuse, incest and spying - following a controversial ‘right to be forgotten’ ruling.

The new batch of articles, dating as far back as 2003, are just several of thousands that Google has started to remove from the EU version of its search engine since the ruling was made in May.

News organisations throughout Europe have condemned the move, describing it as an infringement on freedom of speech and a compromise of basic human rights.

The latest articles to be removed from MailOnline include the May 2009 article describing the sordid captivity in which Josef Fritzl (left) kept his family. Google also took down a story about multi-millionaire Tory MP, Jonathan Djanogly (right), who was thought to have spent £5,000 on private eyes to spy on his local party members

The European Data Protection Regulation, Article 17 includes the ‘right to be forgotten and to erasure’.

Under Article 17, people who are mentioned in the data have the right to ‘obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data relating to them and the abstention from further dissemination of such data.'

This relates to data about the person when they were a child, when the data is no longer relevant or necessary for the purpose it was collected, the person who owns the content withdraws their consent, the storage period has expired, or if it was gathered illegally.

The EU defines ‘data controllers’ as ‘people or bodies that collect and manage personal data’.

The EU General Data Protection Regulation means any data controller who has been asked to remove data must ‘take all reasonable steps, including technical measures' to remove it.

If a data controller does not take these steps they can be heavily fined.

Earlier this year, the 
European Court of Justice ruled that Google must remove links to websites that include content that is ‘inadequate, irrelevant or no 
longer relevant.’

So far, more than 90,000 removal requests involving more than 328,000 URLs have been made to Google worldwide.

The content itself has not been deleted from MailOnline, but Google will not list it in search results.

Instead,
 users searching for the topic on google.co.uk will see a message that 
says: ‘Some results may have been removed under data protection law in 
Europe’ at the bottom of the page.

The latest articles to be removed from MailOnline include:

MailOnline received a notification saying: 'Please note that in many cases, the affected queries do not relate to the name of any person mentioned prominently on the page. For example, in some cases, the name may appear only in a comment section'

These stories will no longer appear on 
search results on google.co.uk. However, those visiting google.com will 
not be affected, even if they visit that webpage from a European 
country.

While
 the search engine does not disclose the identity of who made the 
request, they do have to verify that the link is about that person or 
they have the legal authority to act on the claimant’s behalf.

What is the link?

Those seeking to have information about them removed can visit the legal section of Google's website. On this page, a form allows users to put in a search removal request under EU data law.

Who can use the form?Only
 EU citizens are allowed to submit a request via the form and apply to 
have their links removed if their legal name appears. They will have to 
explain why the link should be taken down.WHAT 

Which requests will be considered?All
 requests will be considered but Google, but it will have to balance 
privacy with the public interest, the company has said it will not 
remove all cases.

What can I do if a case is not resolved?In Britain users can contact the Information Commissioner's Office or take Google to court.

MailOnline received a notification saying: ‘Please note that in many cases, the affected queries do not relate to the name of any person mentioned prominently on the page.

‘For example, in some cases, the name may appear only in a comment section.’

MailOnline publisher Martin Clarke has described the move by the search engine as 'the equivalent of going into libraries and burning books you don't like'.

Other MailOnline stories removed from Google results include claims from April 2013 that a ten-year-old girl could have died if her parents had relied on the NHS 111 helpline.

More recently, Google removed a MailOnline story about a teenager, Kyle Ivison, slapped with an Asbo for committing 40 per cent of the offences in his town.

Google is the dominant search engine in Europe, commanding about 93 per cent of the market, according to StatCounter statistics. Microsoft's Bing has 2.4 per cent and Yahoo has 1.7 per cent.

David Drummond, senior vice president of corporate development and chief legal officer at Google, said: 'The issues here at stake are important and difficult, but we’re committed to complying with the court’s decision.

‘Indeed it's hard not to empathise with some of the requests we've seen - from the man who asked that we not show a news article saying he had been questioned in connection with a crime (he’s able to demonstrate that he was never charged) to the mother who requested that we remove news articles for her daughter’s name as she had been the victim of abuse.

‘It’s a complex issue, with no easy answers. So a robust debate is both welcome and necessary, as, on this issue at least, no search engine has an instant or perfect answer.’

The ‘right to be forgotten’ ruling has come under attack by major organisations who believe it infringes on freedom of speech.

Last month, the foundation which operates Wikipedia described the rule as 'unforgivable censorship'.

Speaking at the announcement of the Wikimedia Foundation's first-ever transparency report in London, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales said the public had the 'right to remember'.

‘We are on a path to secret, online sanitation of truthful information,’ said Geoff Brigham, general counsel at the Wikimedia Foundation.

‘No matter how well it may be intended, it is compromising human rights, the freedom of expression and access to information, and we cannot forget that.

‘So we have to expose it and we have to reject this kind of censorship.’
