Sky is to increase its prices for sports and family entertainment packages in Britain, just six weeks after it agreed to pay a record fee for the rights to show Premier League football matches.

Sky, which normally increases its prices in September, said on Thursday the price of a sports TV package would rise by £1 to £47 a month. It reflects the balancing act it is attempting after agreeing to pay £4.2billion to show 126 live Premier League matches a season from 2016 to 2019, fending off fierce rival BT.

Sky said upon the announcement of the record Premier League deal that it would try to make sure its customers would not have to foot the bill.

As of June, it will cost £47 a month to watch Sky Sports pundits such as Thierry Henry (centre)

'The company will work hard to minimise the impact of higher rights costs on customers, with the majority of the funding coming through substantial additional savings to be delivered by efficiency plans,’ a Sky spokesman said upon the announcement of the rights in February.

Sky's family bundle, which includes its highest profile shows and box-sets of drama, would rise by £3  a month to £36.

Analysts said the lower price rise for sports channels might reflect a concern within the company that viewers could defect to BT, which won the right to show 42 games a season and has also beaten Sky to show Champions League matches from later this year.

The price increases will take effect in June. Analysts at Citi said this was prudent as the previous timetable would have resulted in Sky trying to increase prices just as the Champions League matches disappeared from its channels.

Sky may also have been encouraged to move ahead with price rises now after recent quarterly results showed the number of people leaving the platform had reduced.

'The experience of Canal+ in France suggests losing rights does not impact subscriber volumes, but does impair pricing power,' Citi said. The analysts said the price rises could result in an around 10 percent increase to earnings per share.

Shares in Sky, which has recently expanded into Germany, Italy and Austria, were up 1.4 percent, outperforming the FTSE 100 Index which was up 0.4 percent.
