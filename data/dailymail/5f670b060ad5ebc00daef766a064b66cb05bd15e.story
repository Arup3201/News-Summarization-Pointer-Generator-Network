Former Manchester United academy graduate Keith Gillespie has hit back at Mike Phelan's accusation that Manchester United have 'lost the way' by splurging £150million on foreign imports. 

United shipped out homegrown players in Danny Welbeck, who was sold to Arsenal, and Tom Cleverley, who joined Aston Villa on loan, to help pay for their summer spree, which included Radamel Falcao's £6million season-long loan on £280,000-per-week wages.

But while Phelan lamented what he saw as the loss of a United identity cultivated by Sir Alex Ferguson, Gillespie says Louis van Gaal had no choice but to overhaul his squad and stop the 'death by 1000 cuts' being suffered at Old Trafford since the legendary Scot's retirement.

'In all honesty the players Louis van Gaal has moved on would have been my choice to,' said Gillespie on Twitter. 'Welbeck, Nani and Cleverley (were) never (seen) as United players.

'Drastic action was needed. Pursuing the path United were on was death by 1000 cuts. Quality of competing clubs was way better. We're back.'

Gillespie burst into the United first team in 1993 as a lightning-quick winger in the mould of Ryan Giggs, but a series of personal issues, most notably a gambling addiction, meant he never fulfilled his huge potential. Nevertheless, the Northern Irishman enjoyed a top-flight career at United, Newcastle and Blackburn, and won 86 caps for his country.

Concerns: Mike Phelan says Manchester United have lost their way with their summer spending

Despite his breakthrough as a footballer coming through the ranks at Old Trafford, Gillespie insists that United must not be hampered by an ideal of developing youth players and instead should do anything required to achieve success on the pitch - even if that means making a break from Ferguson's methods.

'The United philosophy should be to compete and succeed at the highest level,' he added. 'It wasn't working. I believe it will now. Change had to come.

'Reality (is) United have to have the best players available to compete. Any youth system might assist in that quest but cannot be relied upon.

Finally, Gillespie posed a teasing question to Ferguson's former assistant: 'The question for Mike Phelan is if he had an option of Welbeck or Falcao in his team who would he choose?'

Van Gaal's summer spending spree has included a British transfer record of £60m on Angel di Maria, plus Ander Herrera, Luke Shaw, Marcos Rojo, and Daley Blind.

Phelan suggested this showed a lack of faith in United's youth system, renowned in the past for its production line of world-class talent like David Beckham, Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes, who played alongside Gillespie in United's youth teams.

'Interesting how things have changed at Manchester United now,' said Phelan, Ferguson's right-hand man between 2008 and 2013, to BBC Radio 5 Live. 'A good young kid (Welbeck) coming through - part of the academy system - and they've finally decided now that might not be the way to go so they've moved him on.

'Obviously there is more and more money now in the game, looking further and further afield for players but probably they have lost the way of Manchester United a little bit in the fact that now rather than produce it may be the case where they're buying in.'
