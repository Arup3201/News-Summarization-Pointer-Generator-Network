Hanging quite literally by a thread, this is the adrenaline-pumping moment climber Ally Smith conquers one of the world's most treacherous climbs.

Located in Rodellar, Northern Spain, the rock known as El Delfin - because it is shaped like a dolphin - the huge, rocky arch is considered one of the hardest climbs in the world.

Only one per cent of climbers who attempt to scale the arch succeed.

Don't look down: Hanging quite literally by a thread, this is the adrenaline-pumping moment climber Ally Smith conquers one of the world's most treacherous climbs

Mr Smith  32, from Chester, Cheshire,
 spent a whole day trying to complete the climb with many attempts 
resulting in him falling just short of the finish and dramatically 
plunging back down to earth before swinging through the air.

Mr Smith
 said: 'The first half of the route is climbed in a normal head first 
direction, but near the end of the horizontal section the crux of the 
route is a long reach immediately followed by swinging your legs around 
and climbing a few moves in a feet first direction before the difficulty
 eases.

'I had an intense determination to execute the gymnastic moves through the long ceiling.

Conquered: Passion: Mr Smith, 32, from Chester, Cheshire, has spent the last 15 years climbing rock faces around the world

Achievement: Located in Rodellar in Northern Spain, the huge, rocky arch is considered one of the hardest climbs in the world, with only 1 per cent of climbers completing the climb

Determined: Mr Smith, 32, from Chester, Cheshire, spent a whole day trying to complete the climb with many attempts resulting in him falling just short of the finish and dramatically plunging back down to earth before swinging through the air.[

'I was concentrating so hard that I 
couldn't actually appreciate the amazing view until I'd finished the 
climb and saw the photos of myself.

'It
 was the last climb of the day and it had taken me three attempts to 
complete, so I felt tired, but also very contented to have completed 
such an iconic route.

Mr Smith has spent the last 15 years climbing rock faces around the world.

He
 added: 'I have a long standing ambition to scale an even longer 
horizontal roof at Kilnsey crag in the Yorkshire Dales, known to 
climbers as 'Mandela', because back in the '80s, it was thought it would
 never be 'freed' or climbed without resting on bolts.

'Hopefully this year the hand and foot holds will finally dry out sufficiently for me to finally complete this route.'
