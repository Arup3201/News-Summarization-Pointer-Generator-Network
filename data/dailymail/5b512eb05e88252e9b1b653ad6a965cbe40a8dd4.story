Aided by a shift in wind direction, firefighters are today making a stand against a huge lightning-sparked wildfire burning on the edge of three small Northern California towns.

The blaze, which grew to more than 25 square miles late last night continued to threaten thousands of homes, as fearful residents sought safety miles away at an emergency shelter.

'All we can do is pray,' evacuee Jerry Nottingham told reporters.

Still, with more firefighters 
arriving on the scene and shifting winds helping to keep the blaze away 
from homes, officials said fire crews were able to improve their lines 
around the wildfire.

'We definitely made some good progress today building around this fire,' state fire spokesman Daniel Berlant said late Monday.

The fast-moving Ponderosa Fire was 
one of many burning across the West, where lightning, dry temperatures 
and gusting winds have brought an early start to fire season.

Nearly 1,900 firefighters were 
battling the blaze in rugged, densely forested terrain as it threatened 
3,500 homes in the towns of Manton, Shingletown and Viola, about 
170miles north of Sacramento.

'These are the largest number of 
homes we've had threatened so far this year,' state fire spokesman 
Berlant said. 'The grass, brush and timber up here are so dry, and once 
the lightning with no rain struck, the flames began to spread quickly.'

The fire has destroyed seven homes and was 30 per cent contained after beginning on Saturday.

Melted satellite dishes, the remains 
of burned furniture and charred refrigerators could be seen in some 
homes in the rural area.

As the wildfire burned, massive amounts of smoke poured up from the forest.

The fire forced the closure of Highway 44 and other roads, and prompted the declaration of an emergency in Shasta County.

The Red Cross set up an evacuation 
centre at a sports complex in Redding, where dozens of people, from the 
elderly to infants, as well as about a dozen dogs, were given shelter.

One evacuee, Bonnie Maloy, who 
escaped her home in Shingleton, along with her husband Bill, described 
the scene as they fled the flames.

'Frantic at first, then I said, 
"Let's calm down," and we got everything that's important, things we 
couldn't replace: animals, kids, photo albums,' she said.

Another massive wildfire burning to 
the south in Plumas National Forest since July 29 grew larger over the 
weekend as strong winds pushed the flames past fire lines established 
late last week.

The blaze, about 120miles north of 
Sacramento, has consumed more than 79 square miles and was threatening 
about 900 homes. It was 37 per cent contained.

Elsewhere in California, a wildfire 
in Lassen Volcanic National Park was 65 per cent contained after 
consuming more than 43 square miles. Officials expected firefighters 
would have the blaze contained by later today.

In Mendocino County, a wildfire that 
started on Saturday had consumed about nine square miles. That blaze was
sparked by lightning and was burning in a remote area of thick timber 
and rugged terrain, making it difficult for fire crews to access.

In Idaho, firefighters dug in to 
defend the town of Featherville against the raging Trinity Ridge Fire 
that has chewed through more than 141 square miles in the central region
of the state. Flames had yet to reach Featherville, which has been 
evacuated. But if they do, firefighters said they were ready with a 
planned burnout operation intended to slow the blaze.

A little to the north, Idaho's

late July, had burned 143 square miles.

In Washington state, firefighters 
hoped to fully contain a wildfire that burned dozens of homes in Cle 
Elum, about 75miles east of Seattle. Crews across the state expected 
thunderstorms that could bring moisture along with the possibility of 
lightning and additional fires.

The fire broke out a week ago at a 
bridge construction project and has burned nearly 36 square miles of 
grass, sagebrush and timber in rural areas. Most of Eastern Washington 
was under a fire watch Monday due to high temperatures and low humidity.

Smaller fires were burning in Colorado and Utah after being sparked by lightning over the weekend.

Nearly 1,900 firefighters were 
battling the blaze in rugged, densely forested terrain as it threatened 
3,500 homes in the towns of Manton, Shingletown and Viola, about 170 
miles north of Sacramento.

‘These
are the largest number of homes we've had threatened so far this year,’
state fire spokesman Daniel Berlant said. ‘The grass, brush and timber 
up here are so dry, and once the lightning with no rain struck, the 
flames began to spread quickly.’

The
fire has destroyed seven homes while blackening more than 25 square 
miles. It was just 30 per cent contained after beginning Saturday.

The fire forced the closure of Highway 44 and other roads, and prompted the declaration of an emergency in Shasta County.

The
Red Cross set up an evacuation center at a sports complex in Redding, 
where dozens of people, from the elderly to infants, as well as about a

firefighters said they were ready with a planned burnout operation 
intended to slow the blaze.

Thunderstorms were expected and could cause gusty, shifting winds around the fire.
