Racy: Des Moines Superintendent Nancy Sebring resigned after sending sexually explicit emails from her work account to a lover

The married superintendent of a school district has left her job after dozens of racy emails to her lover were discovered in her work email account.

Nancy Sebring, 57, sent the emails to the unidentified man between March 26 and May 8. More than a quarter of the exchanges were sexually explicit. 

The school official, from Des Moines, Iowa made reference to sex acts and nude photos in the messages.

District officials had read the emails which were sent between the couple using a school laptop and iPad.

President of the school board Teree Caldwell-Johnson told the Des Moines Register she was 'sorely disappointed'. 

In one email, Sebring told her lover that she looked at a naked picture of him during the day 'which gets my heart racing a bit'.

In the illicit notes she writes: 'I'm filled with nervous energy, which I attribute to being consumed with the desire to put my body next to yours with nothing but your tattoos between us and [blank] until we have nothing left to give.'

In another email, she calls the man 'an amazing gift' whom she will 'treasure'.

She continues in a longer passage: 'I've become addicted to everything about your smile, your crazy colorful body, your kisses, your [blank]!

'Of course I don't want you to think that sex is all I think about when it comes to you. In fact, I have been thinking that some ''vertical'' time together would be very nice.'

In another exchange from April 2 this year, Mrs Sebring wrote: 'Have I told you what an incredible sexy man you are? Right now I am thinking about every inch of your body (including your [blank]).'

The
school district does not allow the use of work email for personal 
exchanges. Sending messages of a sexual nature is also banned.

Sebring sent some the emails, which often rambled on for pages, while she was at work while others were sent in the middle of the night.

Illicit: Sebring, who is married, sent around 40 emails over six weeks to her lover

The 57-year-old, who earns $206,178 a year, told the school board she had made mistakes and that she was sorry.

She said the affair had lasted about a month with the man who was not a school employee.

She was due to leave her position on June 30 but came to an agreement with the school board that she would terminate her contract early.

Sebring is due to take up a new role in Ohama, Nebraska but said the authorities there had not been in touch since the scandal came to light. However she added that she had no intention of giving up her new job which has a salary of $275,000.

The resignation is the second that the district has seen this year after another member of staff, a teacher, violated the Internet policy.

A spokesman  Phil Roeder told the Register: 'We don’t spy on our employees. Without a public records request, this would never have come to light.'
