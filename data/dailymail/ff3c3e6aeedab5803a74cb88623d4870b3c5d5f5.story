The beauty terrorist: Linda Dohmen, 20, won the Miss Krefeld title only recently. Police found automatic machine pistol, a silencer, crowbars, knives and rubber face masks in her home

Police in Germany have arrested a beauty queen who they say strolled the catwalk by day... and plotted a terrorist attack by night.

Linda Dohmen, 20, was arrested alongside her brother, Frank, 22, when an elite team of S.W.A.T. agents stormed their home in Krefeld, western Germany, this morning.

There they found an automatic machine pistol, a silencer, crowbars, knives and rubber face masks along with plans to seize hostages at a supermarket where she used to work as a checkout girl.

Detectives say the beauty queen - who was crowned Miss Krefeld last month - and her brother were planning on taking the hostages at the Real supermarket in Krefeld.

A spokesman for the State Criminal Office in Duesseldorf said: 'We have information she and he were part of a four man band planning this hostage taking for money.

'Chains for holding people were also seized from her apartment.'

Her brother and she are being held without bail in a secure police station in the former industrial town in Germany's western Ruhr region.

He has form for trying to blackmail 2,000 people out of 500,000 pounds with offers of fake loans.

Linda, who won the Miss Krefeld title only recently, dreamed of a modelling career and had quit her job as a supermarket cashier in January last year.

Police deployed officers from the specialist SEK - SAS trained paramilitary officers - to carry out the arrests because they learned that she and her brother were 'armed and serious.'

Public plans: On March 25 she posted a picture of herself and two men wearing masks on her Facebook page

On March 25 she posted a picture of herself and two men wearing masks on her Facebook page.

She recently signed on with a modelling agency and was looking for work at events like car shows and conferences when she was arrested.

A former student pal of her's told a local Ruhr radio station: 'She was always ambitious and hungry for money but this....it defies explanation. She seemed such a nice girl.'
