When Charlotte Reeves was diagnosed with breast cancer, she was determined to have whatever treatment she needed to get better.

The mother of two had been shocked to be diagnosed at just 39 and feared she would never see her young children grow up.

‘My first thoughts were initially to panic - I was frightened I was going to die,’ said Mrs Reeves, 40, who lives in Lincolnshire with her husband Gary, 48.

‘Once the whirlwind of the diagnosis was over I realised I’d probably need chemotherapy,’ Mrs Reeves, a paediatric nurse, told MailOnline. ‘It sounds silly but one of the aspects of chemotherapy I dreaded the most was losing my hair.

'To me, losing your hair is an obvious sign that you are having cancer treatment and I also didn’t want to scare the children with my appearance.'

But her hair was saved after doctors at the Bupa Cromwell hospital offered her a special cap to wear during chemotherapy which allows 80 per cent of patients to retain their hair during treatment.

Hair follicles are normally destroyed during chemotherapy because like cancer tumours, they are made up of rapidly growing cells. This is why chemotherapy can lead to hair loss. 

The Dignicap, as it is known, lowers the temperature of the scalp, so the blood vessels become smaller and less blood flows through them.

This means less of the chemotherapy drugs can reach the hair follicle and the hair is not fully exposed to the effect of the drugs.

The treatment, which is also available 
at the Spire Montefiore Hospital in East Sussex, has been shown in 
clinical trials to help eight out of ten women in Europe and Asia retain
their hair during chemotherapy.

Mrs Reeves had been diagnosed in June 2011 after noticing a lump near her nipple. She had a grade three invasive tumour – a fast growing type of cancer and  more common in younger women who have the disease.

‘After surgery to remove  the lump, my oncologist explained that my chances of survival increased from 90 per cent to 99 per cent if I had chemotherapy as well as surgery,' she said.

‘For Gary and I it was a no brainer – we wanted to do everything we could to maximise my chances of survival.

'For me, chemotherapy was a small price to pay for a higher chance of survival. It would be a long haul, though – five months of chemotherapy, followed by another four weeks of radiotherapy.

‘I can’t deny the cap was uncomfortable to wear; it looked like a water polo cap and contained a gel pack which gradually got colder and colder the longer it was on my head.

‘I would have to have it applied 45 minutes before chemotherapy started and it felt extremely cold as it I was having very cold water applied to my head.

It would trigger a typical “ice cream headache” and made me feel a little sick  I had to wear it all through the treatment session and for 20 minutes afterwards – so for about three hours each time.’

The cap was so successful that Mrs Reeves hardly lost any of her hair. Her eyelashes and eyebrows also lasted until the second half of her chemotherapy cycle.

‘My hairdresser couldn’t believe it and my friends kept saying how well I looked,’ she said. ‘ Keeping my hair is a small thing I know – but it enabled me stay positive during treatment and feel normal.

She has since had scans showing no evidence of the disease and underwent reconstructive surgery in September.

She added: ‘I do feel the Dignicap really helped me psychologically, as it meant I didn’t look physically unwell and that was comforting for the children, too.’
