Louis van Gaal has revealed he has not been satisfied with Wayne Rooney's performances as a striker so far for Manchester United, but due to his versatility can play him anywhere.

Rooney has scored twice in four Premier League appearances for United this season, but new boss Van Gaal has opted for a formation change for the Leicester game with the captain moved into midfield in order to make room for Radamel Falcao to make his first start for the club.

The Dutchman told Sky Sports before the game: 'We have played well but can improve and I was not so satisfied with [Wayne] Rooney as a striker and [Juan] Mata as midfielder and that's why I'm changing.

'Rooney can play in more positions, he's a multi-functional player and I have tried him in a striker's position. He's played well but not spectacular and [Radamel] Falcao is a striker and I think he can do it better.

'We have started again because we have played with new system and philosophy is the same and the players have to adapt and that's always difficult.'

In an interview prior to the game with Sky Sports Rooney conceded that while his preferred position is playing upfront, he is happy to play wherever the manager feels best to utilise him.

He said: 'I'm happy to play out wide; I can do a job there and I can do a job up front. It depends on the situation of each game and what the manager wants me to do.' 

Rooney also agreed with claims he is not the player he used to be, with the 28-year-old saying he is now a much maturer game than when he first joined United. 

He added: 'I'm not the player I was... I feel I've progressed my game.

'So I agree with the people who say my game has changed. I done too much running when I was younger and then didn't have the energy to get myself into goalscoring positions in the box.

'I'm a cleverer player now and know when to run into the box and when not to, and as a result more chances have come my way and I've scored a lot more goals for the club.'
