The sun shone as travellers took to the water to bathe their horses in a centuries old traditional washing routine at the Appleby Horse Fair.Â 

The washing of horses dates back to 1685, where the animals are cleaned in the river ready for selling in the annual horse trading event in the small Cumbrian town.

Gipsies from around Europe have descended on the Eden Valley for the annual event, where traditionally travellers parade their horses before potential buyers, racing them at high speed along the 'mad mile' before cooling them down with a dip in the River Eden.

Gypsy travellers take their many horses into the River Eden during the Appleby Horse Fair in Cumbria this weekend

The washing of horses is a tradition dating back to 1685, where horses are cleaned in the river ready for selling in the annual horse trading event in the small Cumbrian town

Thousands of travellers converge during the first week in June every year

The
 fair, which runs until next Wednesday, is the largest and one of the 
oldest of its kind anywhere in Europe, attracting 10,000 gipsies and 
30,000 visitors each year.

King James II granted a Royal Charter in 1685 allowing a horse fair to be held 'near the River Eden', and every year thousands of travellers come from around Britain and the rest of the world to take part.

The historic fair, which became even more popular after featuring in the Channel 4 show, My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding, has been running ever since.

There
 was controversy earlier this week when some travellers set up camp on a
 private golf course at Appleby but organisers said they had worked to 
minimise antisocial behaviour-related problems.
