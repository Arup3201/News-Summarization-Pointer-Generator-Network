John Kerry took a break from a global summit on sexual violence in conflict on Friday to visit London's hottest new venue, the Chiltern Firehouse.

The Secretary of State, who arrived in the UK today for the conference led by Angelina Jolie to tackle rape in war zones, was spotted heading to the popular restaurant during a break in talks.

Kerry is the latest in a string of politicians, royalty, and A-list stars who have graced the luxury venue where, according to reviewers, even God would have to wait for a table.

British Prime Minister David Cameron was also among the high-profile guests seen recently at the Marylebone restaurant, which is owned by hotel magnate André Balazs.

Cameron and his wife enjoyed one of their regular date nights there on Wednesday. The couple are more often pictured at high street chains such as Nando's and Pizza Express.

The restaurant, set in what used to be a parking garage for fire engines, serves up dishes including blackened salmon and kale, and wood-grilled rib eye steak.

Since opening it has become a regular haunt of A-listers, with everyone from David Beckham, Bono, and Lindsay Lohan, to Courtney Love, Ralph Lauren, and Kate Moss spotted there.

Other 
celebrities gracing the venue including Simon Cowell, who was seen 
taking partner Lauren Silverman there last month; talk show host Piers 
Morgan; Rita Ora and model Cara Delevingne.

The converted fire station has been 
described by reviewer Tom Parker-Bowles as 'hotter than the surface of 
the Sun, where even God would have to wait for a table'.
