Blackpool chairman Karl Oyston has taken a swipe at Dundee United for going ‘public’ over his pursuit of Jackie McNamara.

The Championship strugglers made an approach to the Scottish Cup finalists this week after deciding against the permanent appointment of caretaker boss Barry Ferguson, who it was confirmed on Friday has now left the club.

However, in a statement on their official website, the Tannadice outfit announced they had rejected the overture and that McNamara was staying.

Angry: Blackpool have blasted Dundee United for making their pursuit of manager Jackie McNamara public

That angered Oyston, who is under pressure from fans to get his next appointment right after a brush with relegation to League One, and he told Sportsmail his interest in McNamara is now over.

‘I’m always disappointed when any club makes public something which really should not be made public,’ he said. ‘I like to do things properly and sometimes you think that doing things properly is the single worst thing you can do in football. Because this is what happens.

‘The only way you can know if the manager of another club might be interested in joining you is by having a conversation with his club.

‘A conversation is not the same as a job offer. So it generally turns me off hugely if I cannot have a conversation with his club without that private conversation being made public.

‘So, in answer to your question, I have absolutely no interest in conducting a public pursuit in the manager of Dundee United.’

McNamara takes his team to Celtic Park tomorrow for the last league game of the campaign before returning there next Saturday for the final with St Johnstone.

Secret's out: Blackpool supremo Karl Oyston was angered after Dundee United spilled the beans on their chase

He insisted nothing would get in the way of the countdown to the end-of-season showpiece and is already working on plans to make United an even bigger force next season.

‘Nothing has changed. We will just get ready for Sunday and then look forward to next week,’ he said.

‘There’s nothing really more to say about it.

‘I’ve been working with the chairman for the last few months preparing for next season. You have to be ready for different scenarios with players coming in, players out of contract . . . there’s speculation about others moving.

‘Last year, we lost a few key players like Johnny Russell, Jon Daly, Willo Flood and Barry Douglas so we have coped well and have brought good additions in. It will be the same every year.’

Staying power: Dundee winger Gary Mackay-Steven has been boosted by news that McNamara will not leave ahead of he Scottish Cup Final

Winger Gary Mackay-Steven said the news McNamara was staying was a major boost ahead of the cup final - and he insisted McNamara is destined for a bigger job in future once he has taken United to the next level.

‘It’s a great boost for everyone, he’s come in and been a breath of fresh air,’ said Mackay-Steven. ‘If anyone is linked with another job it’s always a good thing. It shows he’s doing something right.

‘When he gets more experience himself he’s destined for the top in the managerial sense. He’s still young and his chance will come. He has made the transition from player to manager and I think he’ll take this club forward a lot more.

‘The manager has shown he’s happy here and the players are happy - and it shows on the park.’
