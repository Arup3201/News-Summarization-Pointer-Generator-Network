The University of Washington is investigating allegations that fraternity members made racial slurs and obscene gestures to black students as they marched past the fraternity house during a protest.

The Seattle Times reports that students allege several white men shouted the comments from the Sigma Alpha Epsilon house as demonstrators passed Feb. 25.

The protesters were in a Black Lives Matter march to raise awareness about racism.

Several students from the University of Oklahoma chapter captured here on video performing their racist song say they've received death threats

The fraternity's chapter president, Michael Hickey, says Sigma Alpha Epsilon has investigated and believes the slurs came from nonmembers. 

The Seattle Times reports he says it's working with others to hold them accountable.

Meanwhile, attorney Stephen Jones tells CNN that some of the fraternity brothers at the University of Oklahoma, who's racist chant caught on tape started investigations into the fraternity's background, have received death threats since the recording was released.

Still others, he said, had been physically assaulted.

Jones told CNN he had been retained by the board of trustees 'to assist assist them in evaluating certain legal issues and other matters that may impact local chapter of SAE.'

'There are no plans right now to sure the university,' he said. 

The Black Student Union has demanded an apology from the fraternity members it says hurled racist insults at them

The Black Student Union has asked the fraternity for an apology and plans to seek sanctions against it from the body that governs the university's fraternities.

The Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter at the University of Oklahoma was closed this month after video surfaced showing members engaging in a racist chant.

Jones is not representing the two expelled members. 

While he agrees there is 'no justification for what occurred. Zero,' he says the members still deserve due process and to have their first amendment rights protected.

'We are committed to following the due diligence and protocols that we have set forth in our fraternity laws,' says the national SAE office, 'as they are designed to enable us to make deliberate, thoughtful decisions that reflect our commitment to our standards and to our members.'
