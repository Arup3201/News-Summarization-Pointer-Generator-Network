The 'prolonged squeeze' on workers' wages must come to an end as the economy continues to strengthen, a business leader has demanded.

John Cridland, director general of the CBI lobby group, said recovery is taking hold and businesses have a 'spring in their step' compared with a year ago.

This is in stark contrast to the mood of hard-working families, who continue to earn around £1,350-a-year less in real terms than when David Cameron became Prime Minister in May 2010.

Decline: When adjusted for inflation, average earnings have fallen from just over £500-a-week when David Cameron became Prime Minister in May 2010, to just over £480-a-week in May 2013.

In his new year message, Mr Cridland said: 'Businesses must support employees in every part of the country to move up the career ladder, while also giving a helping hand to young people taking their first tentative steps into the world of work.'

He added: 'As the financial situation of many firms begins to turn a corner, one of the biggest challenges facing businesses is to deliver growth that will mean better pay and more opportunities for all their employees after a prolonged squeeze.'

Mr Cridland said it was positive news that jobs were being created, adding it was shaping up to be a full-time recovery with the majority of new jobs being permanent.

His statement comes as the GMB union warned that the real value of national average earnings has fallen by 14% since the start of the recession in 2008.

According to the Office for National Statistics, the average national wage in 2008 was £26,137, compared with £27,174 today.

When adjusted for inflation and the rising cost of living, that amounted to a 13.8% fall in real terms.

Mr Cridland said that for the first time 
since the start of the recession, 2014 will see most firms increasing 
the size of their workforce, boosting their graduate intake and the 
number of apprentices they take on.

'The good news is that wages will pick up
 in the year ahead as growth beds down and productivity improves...But 
there are still far too many people stuck in minimum wage jobs without 
routes to progression, and that’s a serious challenge that businesses 
and the Government must address.'

Mr Cridland spoke of the importance of
 skills, calling for a Ucas-equivalent vocational system to help raise 
awareness and parity of esteem for alternative routes to higher skills.

'If
 2013 was the year that business trust took a hammering on a range of 
issues from corporate taxation to energy prices, then 2014 must be the 
year that business leaders take action to rebuild that trust,' he said.

A prolonged squeeze: Percentage pay increases have been outstripped by rising inflation since May 2008

Rise: The UK is set for growth of 1.9% in 2013,rising from 0.5% in the first quarter
