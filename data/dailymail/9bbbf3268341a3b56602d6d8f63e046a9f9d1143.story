Millions of customers will soon be able to speak to a bank adviser ‘face-to-face’ – without having to travel to their nearest branch.

Barclays and Coutts, the Queen’s bank, are both launching a ‘Skype-style’ conferencing service, enabling customers to make a video call to a member of its call centre staff via their smartphone, tablet, laptop or home computer.

But while Barclays last night hailed it as a ‘watershed moment’ in the way people do their banking, campaigners warned its campaign to close branches and introduce new gadgets risked alienating many of its elderly customers.

The High Street giant claims its service will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week – with customers able to use it from the comfort of their home, or on the move

The High Street giant claims its service will be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week – with customers able to use it from the comfort of their home, or on the move.

The lender even promises customers will be automatically matched to a specific member of staff they have spoken to previously, if available.

They will first have to download a video banking app on their smartphone or tablet, and will have to answer questions to prove their identity.

Video banking is the latest move in Barclays’s so-called ‘digital revolution’, which has ranged from finger vein scanning technology, to contactless payment wristbands and the ‘pingit’ service allowing customers to send or receive money using just a mobile phone number.

The scandal hit lender described it as a ‘banking first’.

But Coutts, owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, said yesterday it started testing out a similar system on around 2,000 of its well heeled customers last Thursday.

It plans to extend the service to all 72,000 of its customers if it works well, while RBS plans to test it out on some of its small business customers.

Campaigners have complained that banks risk alienating many customers, including the elderly, who still rely heavily on their local branches and are often not comfortable with technology

Steven Cooper, chief executive of personal banking at Barclays, said: ‘This is a watershed moment for the way people do their banking in the UK – where we will finally be able to interact with customers completely on their terms rather than ours.’

The new technology is part of Barclays’ plans to close down many of its 1,546 branches in a bid to slash costs.

Like other High Street lenders, it claims that customers are increasingly doing their banking online or on their smartphones, and visiting branches less.

Persuading customers to use video banking will bolster its case for further branch closures.

But campaigners have complained that banks risk alienating many customers, including the elderly, who still rely heavily on their local branches and are often not comfortable with technology.

James Daley, founder of Fairer Finance said: ‘By getting rid of branches you begin to exclude people who are unable to bank in any other way. Many older people are just not comfortable dealing with their finances online.’

Barclays’ wealthier ‘Premier’ customers will receive an email next Monday (December 8) inviting them to use the video banking service.

Businesses, mortgage and investment customers will have to wait until early next year.

Barclays says all its retail customers, including its 12 million current account holders, will be able to use the service by the end of next year.

It already offers video banking in some of its branches.
