Susan Neill-Fraser is behind bars for a crime she and her family adamantly claim she didn't commit.

But now legal experts have thrown their support behind the innocence plea, saying that her murder conviction of killing partner Bob Chappell on Australia Day in 2009 is 'a serious miscarriage of justice'. They even went as far as saying the case is the 'worst injustices in Australian history'.

The grandmother and mother-of-two is currently serving a 23-year jail sentence for the murder of the Hobart man whilst aboard his yacht - the 'Four Winds' - on Tasmania's Derwent River.

Neill-Fraser was convicted for the murder of her partner Bob Chappell on Australia Day in 2009

Neill-Fraser was jailed for murdering Mr Chappell - her partner of 18 years - on the Australia Day weekend five years ago and has since been held at Risdon Women's Prison in Tasmania.

The day before the murder, the couple had spent the day together on the yacht when Mr Chappell decided he would stay aboard overnight while his partner returned home on a dinghy.

The morning after, the yacht was discovered half-submerged and Mr Chappell was missing - presumed dead.

Although his body was never found, the prosecutor told the court that Neill-Fraser attacked Mr Chappell and dumped his body in the River Derwent.

While Neill-Fraser has lost two attempts to overturn the conviction, she and her family maintain her innocence.

And so do the legal experts, reported 60 Minutes.

They likened the accusations of Neill-Fraser to Lindy Chamberlain's murder conviction of her baby.

Dr Robert Moles ranked the Neill-Fraser case to be the worst injustices in Australian history.

Daughter Sarah Bowles, who continues the fight to free her mother, says her faith in the Australian justice system has shattered

'The fact of the matter is, the case was carefully tailored to fit a particular outcome and the preferred scenario,' he said on the program which aired on Sunday night.

'It didn't take into account all the other factors.'

They include the mystery DNA of then homeless 16-year-old Meaghan Vass found on the deck of Four Winds.

She denied ever being on the yacht and the prosecution said that her DNA was on board due to 'secondary transfer'.

But this was rejected by the Victorian Police Forensic Office, which stated in a report that 'there is no evidence to support the hypothesis that the DNA detected was the result of a secondary transfer'.

Dr Moles believes this is enough to warrant a retrial.

'You don't have to establish that Sue Neill-Fraser is innocent, you don't have to establish that Meaghan Vass is guilty of anything,' he said.

'You just have to show that the case put to the jury was incorrect and that would be in itself sufficient to warrant a retrial.'

Another homeless person, this time a man with a criminal history, was allegedly near the yacht at the time of incident.

But Paul Row was only interviewed by police three years after Mr Chappell's disappearance and a year after Neill-Fraser's conviction.

Soon after the questioning, Mr Row left Tasmania.

Another one of the prosecution's claims was criticised by lawyer and former police officer Barbara Etter.

While the court was told that a Four Winds dinghy had been covered with Mr Chappell's blood, Ms Etter said an independent expert had verified there had been 'none' of his blood in the boat.

Ms Etter believes the murder case wasn't thoroughly investigated.

'We're seeing the same error that was made in Lindy Chamberlain over 30 years ago,' she said.

Yet new evidence is not admissible on appeal in Tasmania, like most of Australia.

Daughter Sarah Bowles said her faith in the Australian justice system has been shattered.

But she continues the fight to free her mother with hope that justice will finally be served.
