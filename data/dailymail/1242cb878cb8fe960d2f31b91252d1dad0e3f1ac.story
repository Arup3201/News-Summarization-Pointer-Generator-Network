A top AEG executive referred to Michael Jackson as 'the freak' hours before their company signed the pop icon to a huge concert deal.

Another exec called him 'creepy'. The revelation meant an audible gasp could be heard in the Los Angeles courtroom at the wrongful death trial.

Some fans even left crying.

Emails: Michael Jackson was referred to as 'freak' in AEG email

Michael Jackson's mother and children are suing AEG Live claiming the company was negligent in hiring the personal physician who was later convicted of killing the pop superstar.

It also says AEG pushed Jackson too hard despite signs that he was in poor health.

Katherine Jackson watched from the front row as her lawyer questioned AEG Live Senior Vice President and General Counsel Shawn Trell about an e-mail exchange with his boss at parent company AEG.

'Is it the policy of AEG to talk in derogatory terms about the artist you're going to do business with?' Jackson lawyer Brian Panish asked.

'No,' Trell answered.

Panish then showed jurors an e-mail Trell sent on January 28, 2009, to Ted Fikre, AEG's chief legal officer, explaining  he was about to go to Jackson's home for the signing of the contract for his 'This Is It' concert tour.

'Does that mean you get to meet the freak?' Fikre replied.

Trell responded: 'Apparently. Not sure how I feel about that. Interesting for sure, but kind of creepy.'

The e-mail exchange occurred less than four hours before Trell and other AEG executives visited Jackson's Los Angeles home.

'This is a man you hoped to make millions and millions of dollars from?' Panish asked Trell. 'Didn't your mom ever say if you don't have anything good to to say about someone, don't say anything?'

Trell earlier testified that he was excited to meet Jackson for the first time and was impressed with his 'good, firm handshake.'

'I may not have necessarily agreed with some of the life choices Michael Jackson made, but I certainly had enormous respect for him as an entertainer.'

AEG say that Jackson chose, hired and supervised Doctor Conrad Murray.

'That email just exemplifies that AEG had no respect for Mr. Jackson.,' Panish said outside of court. 'All he was was a vehicle to make money and to promote their concert business to catch up to Live Nation.'

Live Nation is the chief rival of AEG Live.

Jessica Stebbins Bina, a trial defense lawyer for AEG, said the emails were shown merely to embarrass AEG.

'We are four weeks into trial and we have yet to hear one piece of substantive evidence,' said Marvin S. Putnam, an attorney who is leading AEG's defense.

Murray signed his contract the day before Jackson's June 25, 2009, death, but AEG executives and Jackson never put their signatures on it.

Jackson lawyers argue he had been already working for two months based on an oral contract.

The Jackson lawsuit says that AEG Live executives ignored red flags that should have warned them that Jackson was in danger from Murray's treatment.

Earlier in the day, Trell testified that he had been told that Jackson passed a medical exam for an insurance policy a few months before his death 'with flying colors.'

Trial: The Jacksons are suing AEG, contending the company negligently hired and supervised Conrad Murray, the doctor who administered the fatal dose of propofol to Jackson in June 2009.

A second insurance exam had been scheduled for July 6, 2009 — about two weeks after Jackson died.

The exams were necessary so AEG could buy cancellation insurance for Jackson's 'This Is It' concerts.

The coroner ruled that Jackson died from an overdose of the surgical anesthetic propofol, which Murray told police he was using to treat the singer's insomnia.

Jurors were shown an e-mail sent to AEG Live President Randy Phillips and Co-CEO Paul Gongaware by 'This Is It' stage manager John 'Bugzee' Houghdahl on June 19, 2009 less than a week before Jackson died.

'I have watched him deteriorate in front of my eyes over the last 8 weeks,' Houghdahl wrote. 'He was able to do multiple 360 spins back in April. He'd fall on his ass if he tried now.'
