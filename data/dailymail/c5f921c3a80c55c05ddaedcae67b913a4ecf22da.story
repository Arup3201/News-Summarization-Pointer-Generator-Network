A Texas mother claims she and her 5-year-old daughter were shamed last weekend, when they went shopping for a suit for the little girl in Denison, Texas.

Rachel Giordano and her daughter Maddie stopped by Martha's Miniatures on Saturday to get an Easter outfit when the tomboy little girl asked to try on a suit.

Mrs Giordano told KTEN that when the shop clerk realized Maddie was a girl, she looked at them with a 'face of disgust'.

Dressing herself: Texas mother of three Rachel Giordano (right)says her 5-year-old daughter Maddie (left) was discriminated against at a children's clothing store for wanting to buy a suit instead of a dress for Easter

Shamed: The mother and daughter were shopping at Martha's Miniatures in Denison, Texas on Saturday when one of the store clerks gave them a look of disgust and told Mrs Giordano not to indulge her daughter's tomboy tastes

'She told me that I was promoting wrong behavior. That parent's should not let their children choose the way that they dress if it's cross-gendered,' Mrs Giordano said. 

Mrs Giordano decided to not give the store her business and walked out with her crying to child to J.C.Penney where they found a suit.

Following the eye-opening encounter, Mrs Giordano wrote a negative post about the store on Facebook, leading many of her friends to give the store one-star review's on it's now deactivated Facebook page. 

But before the store's owners took down their Facebook, they wrote a response to Mrs Giordano's complaint, saying that she was a child abuser for letting her daughter decide how she wants to dress. 

Response: Following the incident, Mrs Giordano wrote a post on Facebook and many of her friends gave the shop a one-star rating. The shop responded by defending the reaction with the above response

Closed: Eventually, the shop took down their Facebook and now their website says they are temporarily closed for maintenance 

'This mother brought her three children. She asked if I had a size 5 boy's suit. I found a 6 and a 5. She tried the boys suits on the child and then told me neither suit fit the little girl. I was so shocked, that she asked for a boy's suit for the child. I asked her why she was encouraging this...This is child abuse from the mother.' 

Daily Mail Online's calls to Martha's Miniatures were not immediately returned on Tuesday. The store's website says that they are closed for maintenance and plan to re-open soon.

The Giordano's experience at Martha's Miniatures comes a week after Indiana and Arkansas have passed legislation which allows businesses to cite their religious beliefs as a defense in potential lawsuits with customers. However, many pointed out that businesses could use the new law to discriminate and not serve homosexual customers.

The new law in Indiana has sparked fury across the nation, and has been publicly criticized by celebrities, politicians and businessmen from Apple CEO Tim Cook to Ashton Kutcher. 

Indiana Governor Mike Pence says he will amend the law to clarify that businesses are not allowed to deny service.
