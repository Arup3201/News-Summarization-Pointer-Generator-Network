They would have heard the roars across the entire United Kingdom even if ITV had switched off the sound.

But it is the pictures beamed out from Belfast across the Irish Sea on to and out into the satellite ether which will carry Carl Frampton to global stardom.

The exposure of The Jackal’s first world title defence on terrestrial television in Britain and to 55 more countries around the world will generate a huge new audience for one of the most exciting fighters in the world, let alone these sceptred isles.

Carl Frampton and Chris Avalos went toe-to-toe but it was the Belfast boy who came out on top

When Frampton described this five-round demolition of Chris Avalos as 'easy' he did himself an injustice.

The challenger came to fight in the warrior tradition of Mexican-American boxers and brought a fiery reputation with him.

What he ran into in the bellowing cauldron of the Odyssey Arena was the performance which elevates Frampton to within touching distance of the world’s boxing elite.

There was piercing assessment of Avalos, accurate and dispiriting counter-punching under early on, a vicious softening up of his opponent for three or four rounds.

Then the savage finish which is the hallmark of real fighters.

David Haye tweeted: 'Amazing night in Belfast. Frampton prove's he's 'The Man', I'd so Love to see unification with Scott Quigg

Referee Howard Foster had seen enough by midway through the fifth – and for all his bravura I am sure Avalos had, also.

No Froch-Groves controversy here for this excellent official.

The Ulster faithful were sated, also, and they lifted the roof in vocal adoration of their Jackal who is, indeed, more animal than pet.

Frampton said: ‘I felt great in there.’ And great may be the word to describe him very soon.

He is keen to oblige Scott Quigg, Bury’s WBA regular super-bantamweight champion, probably in Manchester in June.

Then he is agitating for a massive unification fight against Guillermo Rigondeaux, the Cuban division the other key players in this division are so reluctant to fight.

Don’t bet too heavily against Frampton as and when it happens.

They were Ready to Rumble long before Michael Buffer climbed into the ring with his microphone but the American announcer helped crank up the atmosphere in the Odyssey up another notch with his renowned call to battle.

The Belfast night belongs to The Jackal and his people came out in force from both sides of the sectarian divide which first Barry McGuigan and now Frampton have straddled without fear or favour.

We wondered whether we would ever again be party to the like of McGuigan’s uproarious nights in the old King’s Hall but the atmosphere has returned all these years later and transferred even more noisily to the new arena up the road, with a vengeance.

The new kid on the block, with the wise ex-champ to show him the ropes, is the power here now.

And how they roar him to the rafters.

Avalos came in to cat-calls but met the screeches by climbing onto the ropes in his corners and pounding his chest in defiance. The Jackal entered the ring with bedlam prefacing his first defence of the IBF world super-bantamweight title. 

Frampton had said it's either fight or flight for his opponents in this cauldron. To his liking, Avalos came forward and was caught by enough right-hand counters to give Frampton the opening round.

Avalos was again the aggressor at the start of the second and enjoyed some success off his left jab but Frampton was landing the heavier shots.

Avalos was striving to make a brawl of it at close quarters but Frampton is a born fighter and gave better than he got to the body. 

The Mexican-American was using his head as a third fist and there was the beginning of a cut by his right eye. But he rocked Avalos with a succession of left hooks to move further ahead on the cards.

Avalos certainly had come to fight and engaged in some furious exchanges – but Frampton’s speed and accuracy with both hands saw him begin to alarm his challenger with combinations of  a high order. Avalos was beginning to feel the pace and Frampton’s eye was holding together.

Frampton launched a furious onslaught, battering his man around the ring and onto the ropes. Avalos was almost out on his feet but when he fell off them referee Howard Foster gave him the benefit of a slip. 

He might have been better taking a count. No sooner was Avalos back on his feet than Frampton was on him with a vengeance and not to be denied. A barrage of unanswered blows other than by a shaking of the Avalos head left Foster with no option but to stop it.

The place erupted in adoration of the idol of Ulster who has won the affection of all Ireland and surely, now the admiration of the entire UK.
