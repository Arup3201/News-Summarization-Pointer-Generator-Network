Former United States defender Alexi Lalas has warned Steven Gerrard that he faces a huge challenge in Major League Soccer when he joins LA Galaxy in the summer.

The Liverpool captain's move to the California-based club was confirmed on Wednesday and Gerrard will link up with his new team in July after spending 17 seasons in the Reds' first team.

During his first interview for the club Gerrard said he was not moving to MLS for a holiday and Lalas, who was capped 96 times by the US and played for LA Galaxy for two seasons, insists it won't be plain sailing for the 34-year-old.

Alexi Lalas warns Gerrard he will find MLS tough and will face challenges he hasn't faced before

MLS Cup Winners (5): 2002, 2005, 2011, 2012, 2014

MLS Supporters' Shield Winners (4): 1998, 2002, 2010, 2011

MLS Western Conference Winners (Playoffs) (9): 1996, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2005, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014

Winners (Regular Season) (8): 1996, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2009, 2010, 2011

'The man is an absolute legend but I also think it's going to be an interesting adventure for him and his family on and off the field,' Lalas told Talksport. 

'I think it's going to challenge him in a way that he's never been challenged before.

'The Premier League is the most entertaining league in the world, but I would submit to you that the challenges that a player faces would make MLS, in my mind, one of the most competitive leagues in the world.'

Gerrard will be one of LA Galaxy's designated players - a rule that enables MLS clubs to compete for star international players by breaking the league's salary cap - and Lalas expects the former England international to be a big pull for supporters but insists he has to do the business on the pitch too.

'It's wonderful for the Galaxy and wonderful for Major League Soccer and soccer fans in the United States who will get to see him on a regular basis. 

'The legend label will never go away, but it only gets you so far. After everybody has gotten your autograph and teh pictures have been taken you've got to get on the field and you've got to perform.

'Gerrard can be a messenger to the world when he figures out, and it won't take very long, that this is a league that challenges you physically and mentally and, ultimately, is a whole lot better than the perception is out there (England).'
