A man has died during an early morning trip with friends after his kayak capsized on a Scottish loch early today.

The coastguard received an emergency call reporting that one of a party of three kayakers was in the water at Loch Fyne in Argyll.

A rescue helicopter was scrambled and the men were picked up by a lifeboat and taken to Mid Argyll Hospital in Lochgilphead, where the man died.

Tragedy: Loch Fyne in Argyll, Scotland, not far from where I kayaker died following an early morning trip out on the water

He is believed to be in his 20s. His family have been told.

Belfast Coastguard received the 999 call at 6am from one of the three men to report that one of their party was in the water and that they needed assistance.

The RNLI inshore lifeboat from Tighnabruaich was launched and the Coastguard search and rescue helicopter from Stornoway was scrambled.

Although coastguards said the wind was northerly force five and there was moderate visibility at the time, it is thought the weather conditions were not considered dangerous enough for warnings.

Weather warnings for people taking to the water are usually issued at force six, with five being described by the Beaufort Scale as winds of between 18 and 24 mph, with waves reaching anywhere from six to nine feet.

Once on scene the three kayakers were located at the water's edge and recovered by the lifeboat, then taken to shore for onward transport by ambulance to hospital.

The other men's condition is unknown.

Steve Carson, Belfast Coastguard Watch Manager said: 'We were very concerned for these three kayakers. We were able to find them relatively quickly and they have all now been taken to hospital.
