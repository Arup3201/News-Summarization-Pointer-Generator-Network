The husband of a woman and two children reportedly dead is now being eyed by Florida officials as a suspect in their deaths.

Luis Toledo, 31, has been named a person of interest in the disappearance of wife Yessenia Suarez, 28, and children Michael Otto, 8, and Thalia Otto, 9. Officials have not found their bodies, but have confirmed they are deceased, according to WKMG.

The Volusia County Sheriff’s Office is declining to say how they know the trio is dead, instead only confirming Mr Toledo is currently being interrogated and that he is known to be a gang member.

‘Keep in mind this is a very sensitive investigation and we want to be sure it comes to a satisfactory conclusion,’ a sheriff’s office spokesperson told the station.

‘We will make sure the family gets satisfaction when this is finally all over,’ he added.

Last seen on Tuesday, police began looking into the disappearance of the mother and her children Wednesday, the station said.

Mr Toledo was arrested Wednesday after 
police checked in on Ms Suarez and her children following a domestic 
violence incident at her workplace the previous day, the station noted.

He had gone to Ms Suarez's office to confront her about text messages he found on her phone, according to ClickOrlando. He also wanted to speak to coworkers but could not find them, the station added.

A Florida missing child alert was issued for both children early Thursday.

It is not clear if the children are from a previous marriage or relationship.

He was charged with battery for slapping Ms Suarez at her workplace, ClickOrlando reported.

Characterized by the sheriff's office as a gang member, Mr Toledo has multiple arrests and has even served time in prison under an alias.

He has multiple burglary, kidnapping and firearms charges brought against him in the past, according to ClickOrlando.

Mr Toledo even served a four-year prison term under the name Michael Garcia.

He has also been arrested under the names Luis Colon and Hector Soto, according to records cited by ClickOrlando.

Both cars registered to Mr Toledo have been recovered – one at the couple’s home and the other at a local shopping center, according to WKMG.

The last family members heard from Ms Suarez was Tuesday night, they told WKMG.

The missing woman's family has suspected the violent man from the beginning.

'If anybody sees my grand kids please, and my daughter, turn them to me please,' Felicia Perez, Ms Suarez's mother said, according to Click Orlando.

'Please, please I beg you Louis,' she added. 'You know you know where they at, please, that's all I ask.'
