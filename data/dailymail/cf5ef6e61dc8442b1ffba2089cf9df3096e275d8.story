Reece Delashmit wasn't going to let the fact he was in a wheelchair stop him from helping out around his family home.

So when the 11-year-old saw his brother Harry shoveling snow from their Illinois driveway he used a shovel attached to his wheelchair to help clear the way.

Since Reece's father Rick Delashmit uploaded footage of his son's snowplowing antics onto YouTube almost 70,000 have viewed the clip.

Reece suffered a brain injury in a car accident in 2008 and was hospitalized for several months.

When he was released from hospital he couldn't walk, talk, eat or drink.

But six years later he can now walk with a trainer, communicate through a speech device and hand signals, and eat and drink unassisted.

Several months ago Reece got a power wheelchair. Mr Delashmit told Mashable that he and his wife had held off getting the aid because they weren't ready for a 'permanent reminder of his condition'.

But Reece took to the motorized device straight away, and his father was on hand with a video camera to capture the antics. 

In September last year Mr Delashmit posted a video of Reece pulling his sister along the hallway in a trailer he had fashioned out of a laundry basket. 

The video, which shows Reece zooming by with Sophie waving from the basket like she's in a parade, has received more than 26,000 views.
