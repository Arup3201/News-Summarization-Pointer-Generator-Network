An ISIS chemical weapons expert who the U.S. feared was 'gathering equipment' for the militants has been killed in an airstrike in Iraq, officials have claimed.

Abu Malik was killed on January 24 near Mosul, after being 'specifically targeted' by the U.S.-led forces because of growing concern ISIS may be trying to secure chemical weapons.

Malik had worked at Saddam Hussein's Muthanna chemical weapon production facility - a factory to the north-west of Baghdad known for producing lethal sarin gas.

The factory - which still housed the remnants of about 2,500 rockets filled with sarin and other deadly nerve agents - was seized by ISIS-led Sunni rebels in June last year.

Killed: Abu Malik is said to have been killed near Mosul, Iraq, in a targeted airstrike carried out by U.S. airforces on January 24 (not pictured)

Weapons: The chemical engineer worked at Saddam Hussein's Muthanna chemical weapon production facility, which produced the deadly sarin gas, before the fall of Iraq

It is thought Malik, also known as Salih Jasim Muhammed Falah al-Sabawi, joined ISIS at about the same time. 

However, a statement from the UN and U.S. said the weapons would have degraded too much to be any use to the extremist group. 

An official, speaking under condition of anonymity, told the Washington Times coalition members had become increasingly concerned about the extremist group's efforts to acquire chemical weapons.

He was thought to be capable of creating harmful and deadly chemical agents - although there is no evidence ISIS has an arsenal of chemical weapons.

But it is believed to be attempting to pursue a chemical weapons capability. 

Another source told the Daily Beast: 'He was gathering a lot of equipment—we're not really sure for what—before we killed him.

'But it's concerning that someone who was fairly seriously high up in the [chemical weapons] infrastructure linked up with [ISIS]. This wasn't some enlisted guy.'  

Captured: The factory - which still contains 2,500 rockets filled with gas - was taken over by ISIS militants last summer, about the same time Malik is thought to have joined the group

Fears: An anonymous source claims the U.S. was worried Malik was 'gathering equipment' which could be used to up ISIS's chemical weapons capability

Malik, who is understood to have defected to Al-Qaeda in 2005, before changing his allegiance to ISIS more recently, is the first of the 8,000 militants killed since airstrikes began in August to be named by the U.S..

It is thought a number of his associates had already been rounded up by Iraqi troops.

A statement from Central Command said: 'His death is expected to temporarily degrade and disrupt the terrorist network and diminish ISIL's ability to potentially produce and use chemical weapons against innocent people.'

ISIL is another term for ISIS. 

Mathanna, just 45 miles from Baghdad, was once one of Iraq's biggest producers of the deadly sarin gas.

The complex is thought to have been capable of producing around 4,000 tones of nerve agent a year.

The factory began producing mustard gas in  1980, but didn't begin producing significant amounts until a couple of years later.

It moved onto nerve gasses in 1984 - including sarin, which it used to deadly effect in the 1980s and early 1990s.

Sarin gas - which was outlawed in 1993 - is lethal even in small doses, taking one to 10 minutes to kill a person after they inhale the deadly nerve agent if an antidote is administered.

If it is drunk, the victim can survive for up to 18 hours. 

It is one of the most toxic of the known chemical warfare agents, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Exposure to the gas causes pupils to shrink to pinpoint sizes and foaming at the lips, while symptoms include paralysis, loss of consciousness and respiratory failure.

The site was bombed by the US during the 1991 Gulf War, but the munitions there were only partially destroyed, according to the UN - then left to Iraq to take care of. 

But the last major report by U.N. inspectors after the fall of Saddam revealed Bunker 13 still contained 2,500 sarin-filled 122-mm chemical rockets produced and filled before 1991, and about 180 tons of sodium cyanide, 'a very toxic chemical and a precursor for the warfare agent tabun'.

ISIS fighters took over the factory on June 12 this year, in a dawn raid captured on CCTV watched by security guards.
