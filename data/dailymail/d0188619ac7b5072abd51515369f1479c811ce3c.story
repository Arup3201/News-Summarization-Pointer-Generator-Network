Daniel Morgan, 37, was found in a pub car park in Sydenham, south London, in 1987 with an axe embedded in his head. His family maintained he was killed by a professional hitman

A notorious unsolved axe murder from a quarter of a century ago is to be investigated by a judge.

Theresa May will announce details later this month of an 'independent panel review' into the death of private detective Daniel Morgan.

The Home Secretary's panel will have the same powers as the one that reviewed the 1989 Hillsborough tragedy and led to a new criminal investigation.

Campaigners hope Mrs May's move will also trigger a new police inquiry and a successful prosecution of those responsible for killing Mr Morgan in a pub car park in Sydenham, south-east London, in 1987.

The 37-year-old married father of two was found with the axe embedded in his head.

Like the Hillsborough tragedy, the Morgan case has been dogged by allegations of police corruption.

The detective's family believe he was
killed because he was about to unveil a web of corruption allegedly 
involving his business partner Jonathan Rees and a string of police 
officers.

Five inquiries – costing an estimated £50million – have failed to crack the case.

Last year the Leveson Inquiry into 
press standards heard disturbing claims that the News of the World put 
the senior detective who led the fourth and fifth investigations into 
the Morgan murder under surveillance.

Detective Chief Superintendent Dave 
Cook and his then wife Jacqui Hames said the suspects for the killing 
had encouraged the now defunct tabloid to watch them.

Miss Hames told the inquiry she was 
being watched because 'suspects in the Daniel Morgan murder inquiry were
using their association with a powerful and well-resourced newspaper to
intimidate us and try to attempt to subvert the investigation'.

The fifth inquiry into the murder collapsed in March 2011.

Three men charged with the killing – 
Mr Rees and his brothers-in-law Garry and Glenn Vian – were cleared of 
involvement before their trial started.

The 37-year-old married father of two was found with the axe embedded in his head in the car park of the Golden Lion pub in Sydenham, south London, on March 10, 1987

An Old Bailey judge ruled senior 
police had coached one of the supergrasses in the case, and it was 
revealed that large amounts of evidence had not been disclosed.

The panel judge is expected to appoint experts but will not have the power to call witnesses.

A Home Office spokesman said last 
night: 'Discussions are continuing with the family and we hope to make 
an announcement shortly.'
