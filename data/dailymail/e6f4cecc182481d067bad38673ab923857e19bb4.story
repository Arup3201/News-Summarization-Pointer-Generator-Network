The adorable toddler who dropped the f-bomb after taking the ALS Ice Bucket
Challenge has apologised for her 'naughty' behavior.

Three-year-old Scarlett-Rose Davis can be seen sitting in front of a camera with her grandmother who makes her admit that saying F***ing hell was a naughty word and she promises not to say it again.

Looking extremely uncomfortable and squirming as though she wants to run away, Scarlett-Rose dutifully repeats the words after her grandmother Carla Davis-Ball as she is coaxed to say them.

Now say sorry! Mrs Davis-Ball tells her granddaughter to apologise for using the bad language

Ms Davis-Ball, from Coalpool in Walsall, West Midlands, said: 'I couldn't believe it when she came out with that language'

Mrs Davis-Ball said: 'Tell them that it was a naughty word and you're not going to say it again are you?'

Scarlett-Rose repeats: 'It was a naughty word, and I'm not gonna say it again.'

She
 then rubs her eyes, climbs out of her chair and runs towards something more interesting in the back of 
her garden.

The toddler became an unlikely 
internet sensation after taking part in the Ice Bucket Challenge before 
promptly blurting out the F-word - much to the horror of her 
grandmother.

Scarlett-Rose had begged her grandparents to let her take part in the
 craze which is currently taking the world by storm in aid of motor 
neurone disease.

But 
her grandmother said she 'could have died' when the little
 girl blurted out 'f***ing hell' after tipping an icy bucket of water 
over her head - and the episode was caught on camera.

Mrs Davis-Ball recorded the footage of Scarlett-Rose being doused with warm water from a cooking pot after nominating a young friend called Marshall to take the challenge last weekend.

After she put
 it on Facebook and her husband Stuart Ball, 33, uploaded it to YouTube,
 it has been viewed more than 40,000 times since Monday, and has been shared several thousand times around the world.

The 40-year-old, from Coalpool in Walsall, West Midlands, said: 'I couldn't believe it when she came out with that language.

'She has picked up a few bad words when we have gone out for meals or into town.

'It did shock me but she's so clever I'm not surprised she's picked it up. We told her it was a naughty word.

The video captures the moment the little girl stomps off after her icy challenge - exclaiming 'f***ing hell'

'It makes me so happy that a three-year-old picked on a good cause and wanted to get involved. She knows it's for poorly people.'

Scarlett-Rose has a baby brother called Shankley-Gary, aged ten months.

The couple care for the children five nights a week and they spend two nights with their mother Demi Davis, 19.

She adds: 'Scarlett-Rose doesn't really understand what the fuss is about which is probably a good thing.'
