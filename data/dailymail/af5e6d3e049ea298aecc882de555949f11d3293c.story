Georgia Davies of Wales set a new Commonwealth Games record in the heats for the 50 metres backstroke.

The 23-year-old, who won silver in the 100m final, came home in 27.90 seconds ahead of Emily Seebohm of Australia.

England's Lauren Quigley was third-fastest while Kathleen Dawson set a new Scottish record in 28.56.

English pair Lizzie Simmonds and Jess Fullalove also qualified for tonight's semi-finals along with Northern Ireland's Danielle Hill and Niamh Robinson of the Isle of Man.

Scots Ryan Bennett and Craig McNally opened the penultimate day of swimming at Glasgow 2014 by finishing one-two in their heat to reach the final of the men's 200 metres backstroke.

Bennett was fifth-fastest qualifier but Australia are well placed to dominate the final, with 100m medallists Mitch Larkin and Josh Beaver among the fastest four.

Welshman Xavier Mohammed scraped into the final but England's only entrant, Roberto Pavoni, did not compete.

England's Ben Proud split the strong Australian team in the 50m freestyle heats to post the third fastest time in qualifying for tonight's semi-finals.

Cameron McEvoy was three hundredths of a second outside a Games record with a time of 22.04 seconds, while Proud came in at 22.21 - faster than 100m gold medallist James Magnussen.

Proud's team-mates, Adam Brown and James Disney-May, also qualified for the last 16 along with Scotland's Richard Schafers and Curtis Coulter of Northern Ireland.

There was more Welsh promise in the women's 200m butterfly heats with 2010 bronze medallist Jemma Lowe the second-fastest qualifier and team-mate Alys Thomas also making Monday night's final.

Scotland's Hannah Miley, who is going for a third Glasgow 2014 medal, booked her place along with England's Aimee Willmott.

England's Ollie Hynd finished five seconds ahead of the field in the para-sport 200m individual medley heats. The Paralympic champion, who has a degenerative muscle condition, races the same four rivals in Monday night's final.
