A 16-year-old Nigerian girl who won weightlifting gold faces being stripped of her title after providing the first in-competition positive drugs test of the Commonwealth Games.

Sir Craig Reedie, president of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), expressed his shock that an athlete as young as Chika Amalaha should test positive for banned substances.

The teenager became the youngest female winner of a Commonwealth weightlifting title when she scooped gold in the 53kg class last Friday, but will be disqualified today if her ‘B’ sample results match those of her ‘A’ sample, which showed traces of a banned diuretic and masking agent.

Doubt: Nigerian weightlifting gold medalist Chika Amalaha has failed a doping test at Commonwealth Games

Reedie said: ‘I am very disappointed that somebody as young as that appears to have committed an offence at a multi-sport event like the Commonwealth Games.’

If Amalaha is stripped of her gold medal, it is understood WADA will investigate how such a young athlete was given access to illegal substances.

Her positive test also prompted questions about weightlifting’s legitimacy as a Commonwealth sport.

The event has a history of drug-related incidents, while Nigeria was barred from the 2002 Games in Manchester after four athletes tested positive in 2001.

But Mike Hooper, chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF), said: ‘I think weightlifting is a fantastic sport and a strong Commonwealth and Olympic sport.

‘I think the issue here is about showing we have a robust anti-doping programme in place.’
