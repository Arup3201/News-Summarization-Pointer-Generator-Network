Five hundred to one was the price quoted to optimistic punters who felt Harry Kane had it in him to become the Premier League's top scorer at the beginning of the season. That's not looking such a gamble now.

Nineteen goals later during one of the most breathtaking and honest seasons in recent memory, he's level with Diego Costa.

Kane is with Roy Hodgson's England squad this week and can lay claim to being the country's only genuinely complete frontman.

Kane's goals have come from a variety of angles in what has been a staggering season for Spurs

His international team-mates who share St George's Park with him in the coming days will doubtless notice the 21-year-old's range of ability.

Kane is as comfortable 25 yards from goal as he is in the penalty area – and the visuals of his stunning campaign tell the whole story.

Predominantly right-footed, it's little wonder that 10 of his strikers have come that way, but Mauricio Pochettino – and now Hodgson – will be enthused at the other ways in which he finds the net.

Kane's spike of goals came around Christmas and he has added more headers and left-footed strikes recently

Kane (celebrating scoring against Aston Villa in November) has been in stunning form for Spurs

Brad Guzan had no chance after Kane's free-kick swerved beyond him at Villa Park

Four have come via his head, with five slammed home with his weaker left peg. Nine goals have been netted from more than 12 yards out.

Those include a 29-yard hit in the 5-3 win against Chelsea on New Year's Day, and that stunning swerving free-kick at Aston Villa earlier in November.

Compare that to Wayne Rooney, who has 11 for the season - nine of which came with his favoured right. His goals have contributed 22 points to Spurs charge towards the top four, too. 

Kane's rise to prominence has been staggering and, with five goals in his last three, is in prime position to pip the injured Costa and send the bookies into a sulk.
