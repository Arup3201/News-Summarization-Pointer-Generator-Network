The couple whose picturesque proposal on a remote peak sparked an unexpected social media manhunt has been identified.

A striking image of a man kneeling in front of his new fiancée atop Munra Point, Oregon, with a dramatic cloudy backdrop, was snapped by a passing walker, unbeknownst to the two sweethearts.

When posted to social media and internet forums, the image prompted hundreds of internet vigilantes to track down the happy couple, now identified as Alex Gensitskiy and Katie Verkovod.

The pair, intensely focused on the task at hand, had no idea they have been pictured from afar, or that their romantic moment on November 27 would cause so much enthusiasm online.

Gensitskiy and Verkovod, both from Washington, met at church camp in early 2013, according to local news station KATU.

In an account of the proposal posted on a crowdfunding page for their honeymoon, Gensitskiy described his nervousness as he climbed the slope.

He said: 'As we ascended the mountain my heart beat as fast as a drum. Boom, boom, boom... 

'...Finally, we reached the top of the mountain, and as the mist swirled around us, I got down on one knee and proposed to the love of my life.

'With great surprise and extreme joy, she exclaimed "Yes! Yes!"'

The two plan to marry in July.

Gensitskiy later explained that he was actually hoping that nobody would notice them during the fateful ascent, so he would have a clear stage to pop the question.

He told KATU he was thinking: 'Oh man, I hope they don’t come up to us or anything... I’m about to propose! You know, I don’t want people around!'

Responding to the photograph's popularity, Verkovod said: 'I was kinda shocked, because I wasn’t expecting taking a picture because we didn’t have our phones'.

But she added: 'It was just beautiful... it brought back so many good memories.
