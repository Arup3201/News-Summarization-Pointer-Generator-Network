Cycling can be a serene way to spend a Sunday afternoon, until you arrive at a steep uphill climb and have to give it all the energy you've got just to get over it. 

With this in mind, researchers have created a bike wheel that not only knows when you're struggling, it will activate a built-in electric motor to give you a supportive boost of power.

Called the Copenhagen Wheel, the device can be installed as part of a rear hub of any bike wheel and is fitted with a computer, rechargeable batteries and sensors that monitor how hard a rider is peddling. 

By connecting to a smartphone via Bluetooth, the wheel can then track distances and elevation and will switch the electric motor on and off to suit the terrain.

The Copenhagen Wheel, pictured, can be fitted to any bike and syncs wirelessly to a smartphone. A built-in computer tracks how hard a rider is peddling, using distances travelled and elevation, and activates a motor to kick in if the cyclist is struggling uphill, for example

The Copenhagen Wheel is installed as part of a rear hub of a bike wheel and can connect wirelessly to a smartphone app.

The device is fitted with a computer, batteries and sensors that monitor how hard a rider is pedalling.

It does this by monitoring the energy output, as well as by tracking the rider’s GPS location and elevation via the app.

A built-in motor will kick in whenever the wheel thinks the cyclist is struggling, when riding uphill for example. 

The smartphone can also track distance travelled and calories burned.

The smartphone app can also track the number of calories burned and lock the wheel remotely as soon as the owner walks away from the bike.

‘The motor integrates itself with the rider's motion very, very seamlessly,’ said Assaf Biderman, who co-invented the device at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's SENSEable City Lab.

‘It's almost like having a riding companion riding together with you, making the ride easier, simpler.'

The Copenhagen Wheel has enough power to propel a rider as fast as 37 mph.

However, the developers have put speed limits in software to meet local cycling speed limits, effectively turning off the motor once the speed reaches 20mph in the U.S. and 15mph Europe.

The concept was inspired by a simple question: ‘How can we get more people to cycle?’ said Biderman.

The project received funding from the Italian ministry of the environment and office of the mayor of Copenhagen.

Fitted inside the wheel (from left to right) is a motor, a computer, and a rechargeable battery. There are also multiple sensors including a GPS unit and an accelerometer. The motor can reach speeds of up to 37mph

The first 1,000 Copenhagen Wheels became available for pre-order through the Superpedestrian website earlier this month and cost $699 (£429) each.

According to the Superpedestrian site, at least 810 have already been sold.

The Copenhagen Wheel does not replace a cyclist's existing bicycle, instead cyclists get the hubcap-sized device installed on a new rear wheel that fits their current bicycle.

It is similar to the £340 FlyKy Smart Wheel.
