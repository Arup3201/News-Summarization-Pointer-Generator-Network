Brazil's 1-0 victory against Chile may have been an ill-tempered affair, but the Selecao squad seemed in high spirits during a night out in London on Sunday night.

Neymar enjoyed an evening at Novikov restaurant before heading to Kensington club Boujis, where former Black Eyed Peas star apl.de.ap was also in attendance.

Neymar posed for pictures with fans while clutching a can of energy drink before heading into the popular nightspot while Chelsea star Willian was accompanied by his wife Vanessa Martins.

Chelsea winger Willian was also out on Sunday night but didn't join Neymar at the club

Willian, Douglas Costa and even Brazil boss Dunga were also out in London, although they didn't join Neymar later on at the nightclub. 

Earlier on Sunday, Barcelona star Neymar hit out at the 'UFC' style bully-boy tactics deployed by Chile during his side's 1-0 friendly victory at the Emirates on Sunday.

The 23-year-old was on the end of some tough tackling throughout the ill-tempered clash and was lucky to escape injury following a nasty stamp from Chile midfielder Gary Medel.

The former Cardiff City man seemed to tread on Neymar's ankle following a challenge in the first half, but escaped with even a yellow card.

'This wasn't a game of football,' Neymar said. 'It's meant to be football not UFC. The referee is there to stop these things from happening, but there were four referees and none of them saw anything!

'It seems we have to suffer. I am a sufferer.'

A Roberto Firmino strike was enough to seal victory for Dunga's side, who have now won eight games in a row since their disappointing World Cup exit.

Remarkably referee Martin Atkinson didn't punish the stamp by Medel as Neymar was left writhing
