Go on - give her a tickle.

This little meerkat just can't stop laughing when she's given a tummy rub.

Named Betty Boo, she lives at the Harnas Wildlife Foundation in central Namibia where a volunteer videoed her being tickled.

Having a laugh: Betty lives at the Harnas Wildlife Foundation in central Namibia

The staff there quickly realised, as the clip shows, that she loved it.

Betty arrived at the foundation two years ago after being sent there by a family in Windhoek who wanted to donate her to Harnas as she was biting them.

On Facebook, the foundation said: 'Herman swiftly fell in love with her and named her Betty! After many discussions and arguments we decided on Betty Boo rather than just Betty!

'She is a beautiful little lady, very kind and cuddly! Linn, our vet nurse, has taken a real shine to her and spends every spare second walking with her on the lawn.

'We have just started the process of introducing her to our other Meerkats; Adam and Eve. Their first meetings went very well so we have high hopes to release the newly formed pack into the lifeline.'Â
