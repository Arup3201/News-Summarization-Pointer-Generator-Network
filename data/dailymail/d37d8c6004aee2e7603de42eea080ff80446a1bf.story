The Paterson, New Jersey boy mauled to death by a bull mastiff has been identified.

Kenneth Clodo Santillan, 13, was killed, and another 13-year-old boy was injured Friday by the 115 pound canine as they made their way home from school.

Paul Clarke, the hulking beast's owner, reportedly had to stab his beloved 'Trigger' in order to subdue the animal, according to the New York Daily News.

Just a young boy: Santillan had recently celebrated his 13th birthday, according to his Facebook page

Santillan was walking with the friend along a creek in back of Clarke's home, contrary to initial reports that said the teens were on a sidewalk in front of the house, when the attack occurred, according to neighbor Elizabeth Hatsko told MailOnline.

The dog jumped out at the boys, initially attacking the unidentified friend, before they split up. Santillan was tragically run down by the killer canine and mauled to death before Clarke stepped in.

Clarke ran at the dog, and was attacked himself, before stabbing it several times to keep it at bay until animal control arrived, according to the Bergen Record.

Hatsko said she saw blood pooled in neighbor Clarke's driveway, the Record reported several blood stains in the snow lining the creek.

'Such a tragedy,' Santillan neighbor Rose Corbo told MailOnline.

The incident occured in the afternoon, but the Santillan's body was not found until near 11.00pm, officials said. His injured friend took part in the search.

Authorities took the dog into custody and had it 'humanely euthanized,' authorities said. It was not exactly clear how the dog's life ended, and MailOnline was not immediately able to reach those responsible.

Relatives mourned the loss of their beloved Ken on social media.

'RIP the best cousin I've had,' Cassie Nadia commented on a picture posted by Carlos Pastor.

It is not clear if Clarke will face any criminal charges, but a lawyer retained by injured but alive boy's family intends to sue for damages.

'We intend on pursuing a claim for his injuries, certainly,' the attorney told the Record.

Friday's incident was not the five-year-old dog's first dash for freedom, according to Hatsko.

Trigger had escaped two times prior to Friday's incident - once he was recovered by Clarke, a second time he was found by Animal Control.

The dog barked a lot and intimidated neighbors, but it had not attacked anyone prior to killing Santillan, Hatsko said.

Hatsko said the dog was big, and intimidating, but gentle with her grandchildren. She believes the dog was provoked into going after the young children.

'The boys got in the back there, and nobody’s supposed to be back there,' she said. 'He’s behind the fence, and you know how kids do…they would tease him, they would run.

There appears to be no relationship between the victims and the dog's owner, who has been identified by prosecutors.

'If you were provoked, wouldn’t you fight back,' said Hatsko. 'An animal’s an animal.'

A witness described the aftermath of the horrifying attack to the New York Post.

'The boy said, ‘I got bit by a dog and I can’t find my friend, we’re looking for him,' Maria Zachus said. 'Then I heard the guy say, ‘He’s here, he’s here! I found him!

'The father was screaming and crying, ‘My son, my son, my son — but why here, oh God why, why?’ Zachus continued.

Criminal charges have yet to be filed. 

Paterson resident Orlando Cepeda told reporters he and his wife were walking through the area at approximately 4 p.m. Friday when they saw a teenage boy who was bleeding heavily from his left hand.

'He said, 'a dog bit me,' Cepeda said. 'He was running. He was scared.'

A driveway on Sherwood Avenue was later discovered spattered with blood.

Neighbor Jose Hernandez reported witnessing flood lights, ambulances, and police that afternoon. He also saw bloodstained snow on the embankment of the Passaic River.

Paterson Detective Capt. Heriberto Rodriquez said further information about the attack would be released.

This is the second time in a month a New Jersey child has been injured by dog attack. Earlier in February, a Newark boy, age 10, was found critically injured after being left alone with two pitbulls in his father's apartment.

In that case, the boy was bitten several times and slashed before a neighbor broke down the door to rescue him.

His father, Enrique Carillo, 41, was charged with child endangerment.
