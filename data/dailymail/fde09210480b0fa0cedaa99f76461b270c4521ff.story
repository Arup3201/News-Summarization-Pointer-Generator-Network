The majority of Nigerian schoolgirls who managed to escape from their Islamic extremist captors reunited today to meet with the country’s president.

President Goodluck Jonathan heard tales from some of the 57 who escaped after their abduction on April 15 before assuring them of his determination that those still in captivity ‘are brought out alive’.

Following the meeting in Chibok, presidential spokesman Reuben Abati told reporters it was a ‘very successful event’.

The schoolgirls managed to escape their abduction by Islamic extremists, but more than 200 are still missing

During the meeting of around 177 people, which included the schoolgirls and their parents, Jonathan gave assurances that the education of the schoolgirls and their still-captive classmates would not suffer in any way

During the meeting of around 177 people, which included the schoolgirls and their parents, Jonathan gave assurances that the education of the schoolgirls and their still-captive classmates would not suffer in any way.

Mr Abati said: ‘Mr President reassured them of the federal government determination and his personal determination to ensure that the girls that are still in captivity are brought out alive.

‘He made it clear that is the main objective of the government.’

The parents of many of the 219 kidnapped Nigerian schoolgirls emerged from the closed door meeting without showing emotion but some shook hands with the president. Some of the escaped schoolgirls smiled for photographers after the meeting.

At least 11 of the parents have died since the kidnappings - seven in a village attack this month and four of heart attacks and other illnesses that the Chibok community blames on the trauma, according to residents.

Jonathan was accompanied in the meeting by the ministers of education and finance, and his national security adviser.

Also present was the Gov. Kashim Shettima of Borno state, from which the girls were abducted.

Shettima has accused Jonathan of not doing enough to save the girls and has angered the government with his charges that Boko Haram fighters are better armed and motivated than Nigeria's military.

Today's meeting came after months of the parents asking to see the president. He finally agreed this week following a request from Pakistani girls-education activist Malala Yousafzai. 

The failure of Jonathan's government to 
rescue the girls has prompted an international campaign and daily 
BringBackOurGirls rallies in Abuja, the capital, to ensure attention for
 the girls' plight.

Around 57 
students managed to flee shortly after they were captured, but a 
committee investigating their disappearance said 219 of the girls are 
still missing.

According to a mediator working with Boko Haram two of the girls have died of snake bites while around 20 have fallen ill.

Residents have warned that there is a famine looming in Chibok because food stocks are being depleted by the growing population.

Four
 or five families are having to share small houses because nearby 
villagers who survive  assaults are swarming into the town.

Some
 of the parents and community leaders of Chibok have made public 
statements urging Jonathan to negotiate with the girls' captors.

Boko Haram is demanding a swap for detained fighters in exchange for the girls but so far, Jonathan has refused.

Nigeria's Defence Ministry, which has
 also been criticised for not quickly rescuing the girls, has said that 
it knows where they are being held but fears any military campaign could
 get them killed.

Jonathan
 has never before met with the parents or the escaped girls, although he
 has insistently repeatedly that: ‘My priority is the return of these 
girls.’

The number 
of soldiers guarding Chibok has increased from 15 to around 200 since 
the kidnapping but they have done little to increase security.

They often refuse to deploy to villages under attack even though there is advance warning 90 per cent of the time.    

Most
 of the schoolgirls are still believed to be held in the Sambisa Forest —
 a wildlife reserve that includes a mixture of thick jungle and open 
savannah.

The
 forest borders on sand dunes marking the edge of the Sahara Desert. 
Sightings of the girls and their captors have been reported in 
neighboring Cameroon and Chad.  

Demands: The leader of Boko Haram, Abubakar Sheku, repeated in a video this week that he would exchange the abducted girls for detained extremists 

Displaced: Villagers from Borno State who survive Boko Haram assaults are swarming to Chibok, depleting vital supplies. Earlier this month an attack on Maidguri (pictured) killed 18 people

Chibok and nearby villages are targets because they are enclaves of staunch Christians in predominantly Muslim north Nigeria.

Residents feel so abandoned that they appealed this month for the United Nations to send troops to protect them. 

The U.N. has repeatedly urged Nigeria's government to live up to its international responsibility to protect citizens.
