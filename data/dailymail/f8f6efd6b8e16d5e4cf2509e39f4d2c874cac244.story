A driver lost control of his car and ploughed straight through the side of a house and into a living room, without leaving a single piece of debris on the road.

The driver and all three passengers, as well as the homeowner and her daughter, had to be taken to hospital following the incident in the market town of Louth, Lincolnshire.

Pictures taken at the scene show the red Seat Leon's front end embedded in the side of the £120,000 detached house.

Emergency services were called to the house following the incident at 7.25pm on Friday.

The seriously injured 43-year-old owner of the property had to be airlifted to hospital with broken bones and internal injuries, where she is expected to remain 'for some weeks'.

Her 17-year-old daughter, who was also in the house at the time, was also injured and taken to hospital for treatment.

A 24 year-old woman from Louth, who was a passenger in the car, is still at Hull Royal Infirmary being treated for fractures.

The driver of the vehicle, a 28 year-old man, also from Louth, has since been discharged from hospital.

Two passengers, a 23 year-old man and a 26 year-old woman from Manby, Lincsolnshire, also required hospital treatment before also being discharged.

Emergency services were called to the market town of Louth, Linconshire, after a red seat Leon smashed through a wall on Friday evening

A neighbour living near to the property 
today said: 'I thought it was an optical illusion at the time - the car 
had gone straight through the wall but not a brick looked out of place.

'I am amazed that nobody was killed. It must have been going at some speed to go straight through the wall like that.'

A Lincolnshire Police spokesman said: 'We would like to hear from anyone who may have seen the collision or the vehicle in the area at the time.

'Anyone with any information is asked to call Lincolnshire Police on 101 quoting incident 393 of 27/06/2014 or the Lincolnshire Police Collision Witness Hotline via 01522 55885.'
