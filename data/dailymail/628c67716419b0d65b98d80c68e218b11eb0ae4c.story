West Brom head coach Alan Irvine has left the door open for record-signing Brown Ideye after he axed the £10million man.

The striker was left out of the squad for the 1-0 win at Leicester on Saturday and has so far struggled for form and fitness.

He has netted once since his record-breaking Baggies move from Dynamo Kiev in the summer, in the 3-2 Capital One Cup win over Hull in September.

The Nigeria international picked up an ankle injury in the process but has since recovered and Irvine is happy to speak to Ideye if the forward so wishes.

Irvine said: 'The way that we do it is I say to any player 'If you want to come in on Monday, come in on Monday'.

'But when the team's named and the subs are named they have to accept that, respect the rest of the players and then come back in later if they want to have a chat.

'I might have a chat with him if he feels he needs to have a chat, but if he doesn't then I won't be calling him in.'

Ideye has made just two starts in the Premier League since his record move from Dynamo Kiev

Ideye has made just two starts in the Barclays Premier League this season and has made little impact at The Hawthorns.

Irvine said his omission was purely for tactical reasons as he picked Victor Anichebe and Georgios Samaras on the bench at the King Power Stadium.

'I haven't had a chat with him. We pick the team carefully even if it's the same team. It's still chosen with a lot of thought and care - that applies to the subs as well,' he told the Wolverhampton Express & Star.

'What we knew was that Leicester had a physical presence. Generally, I have two centre-forwards on the bench.

'I decided that I needed physical options there rather than somebody like Brown - whose strengths are running in behind. That's why I went for Victor and Sami (Samaras).'
