In any other circumstances this charming childish doodle would have been stuck to the fridge by a proud parent.

Unfortunately, however, this four-year-old artist decided to test his budding talents on his father's passport while on a family trip to South Korea.

The Chinese national is now stuck in the country after border officials failed to be impressed by his young son's creative addition of people, animals, and a beard - all daubed in black felt tip - to the passport.

It is understood that the problem arose when the man tried to board his plane back to China with the rest of his party.

Thanks to his unrecognisable documentation, he was not allowed to pass through security and make it to his flight.

Authorities have now told the father - known only as Chen - that it is likely he wonâ€™t be able to travel home with his son, and the rest of his family.

The picture was originally posted on social networking site Weibo by the man, alongside a plea for help as to how he would be able to get home, Shanghaiist reports.

The drawing appears to include a cat, flowers and a few people like characters.

The young artist has also drawn a beard and added some additional hair, sprouting from his father's face.
