Sale hooker Marc Jones will join Bristol for the start of next season. 

The 27-year-old forward has made 155 appearances for Sale since his debut in 2005 but will make the switch to Ashton Gate ahead of the new campaign.

Bristol director of rugby Andy Robinson said: 'Marc is an experienced campaigner in the prime of his career. He knows what it takes to succeed in the top flight.

'He's a fiercely competitive performer. Marc has got the mentality and leadership qualities to help drive the progress of our developing players.

'To play in the top flight for 10 years before the age of 27 is an excellent achievement and testament to Marc's professionalism and ability.'

Jones has made nine league appearances for Sale so far during this season.

Northampton and England flanker Tom Wood is stopped in his tracks by Jones in January 

He said: 'I'm relishing a fresh challenge at Bristol, it's an ambitious club and I'm looking forward to being part of their future.

'These are exciting times ahead for Bristol Rugby and there's a real focus around the place to return to the Aviva Premiership. I'm sure that this will be achieved having looked at the quality of players and coaches that Bristol currently has.'
