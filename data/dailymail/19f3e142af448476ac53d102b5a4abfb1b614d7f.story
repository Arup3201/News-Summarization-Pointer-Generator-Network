A Seattle Seahawks super-fan got the ultimate thank you gift just in time for Christmas after helping  a friend of Robert Turbin, Seahawks running back, earlier this year.

In a YouTube video, Alex Hughes's eyes were filled with tears  after he opened the mystery package bearing the Seattle Seahawks logo.

The package contained every football fan's dream: a helmet signed by every player on his favorite team.

'Are you kidding me? This is so awesome,' Hughes exclaimed as he held the autographed helmet in his hands.

'Awesome:' Hughes said 'this is so awesome' before leaning on the ground and wiping the tears from his eyes

A little more than a month earlier, Hughes traveled to Kansas City to watch his beloved Seahawks play against the Kansas City Chiefs. 

Hughes told Komo News that he was decked out in his Seahawks gear when he and his friends went bar-hopping the night before the game. 

Hughes said that he had been heckled all night as tensions were high while football fans anticipated the big game -- the Chiefs won the game with a final score of 24 to 20. 

'This girl walks up to me and says, 'Hey, can I try your jacket on real quick?' Hughes said. 

Autograph: Hughes encountered Turbin's girlfriend who asked to take a photo in Hughes' jacket, the two then planned to meet up so Hughes could get his '12th Man' flag signed by the runningback

Disappointment: He tried to meet up with the woman as the two had planned, but Hughes' phone died and after nearly an hour of searching for the team's bus in the freezing cold weather, Hughes gave up and left

But the Oklahoma father was wary of the woman's request, thinking she might be trying to take his jacket.

The woman told Hughes she wanted to take a photo in the jacket to send to her boyfriend, Seahawks running back Robert Turbin. 

When Hughes asked her to prove she was dating the player, the woman showed him text messages on her phone and a photo of Turbin on her Instagram page, according to Komo. Hughes decided to believe her.

After the photo, the two arranged to meet up after the game so Hughes could get an autograph from the player.

But Hughes' phone died and after nearly an hour of searching for the team's bus in the freezing cold weather, Hughes gave up and left as his friends teased him saying he had been tricked. 

Son: In the video, Hughes opens the package with help from his son who exclaimed 'you won it, daddy! You won it!' after seeing the helmet

Robert: Robert Turbin is a running back for the Seattle Seahawks, the player was drafted in the fourth round of the 2012 NFL Draft 

A week after the encounter,  the mystery woman messaged Hughes on Instagram and asked for his address, according to Komo. Three weeks later, a box marked 'Seattle Seahawks' was on his doorstep. 

In the video, Hughes opened the package with a little help from his son.

With tear-filled eyes, Hughes looked incredulously at the helmet as his son said 'you won it daddy! You won it!'

Hughes told Komo that he has the helmet in a case, on display in his son's room.

'I was just happy to get anything... and then to get this with 30 signatures on it...' Hughes said. 

'I just imagine Robert taking the time for some stranger to walk around his locker room and bug his friends to sign some thing for some guy in Oklahoma - that's incredible that you could have a job that can make somebody that happy.'
