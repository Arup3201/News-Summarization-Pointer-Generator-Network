Children who look unhappy in childhood school photographs are five times more likely to get divorced than those who smile most, a scientist claims.

People who stayed married in later life tended to smile more widely and warmly in their school photographs, while future divorcées were more likely to smile weakly, if at all in their photos.

A U.S. psychologist came up with his conclusions when exploring whether school photos reveal who individuals are in a moment in time, or if they can predict their future.

It's all in the smile, according to one psychologist: People who stayed married in later life 
tended to smile more widely and warmly in their school photographs, 
while future divorcées were more likely to smile weakly, if at all in 
their photos

Matthew Hertenstein, an associate 
professor of psychology at DePauw University, Indiana, measured 
individuals’ emotional displays based on photographs in hundreds of 
school yearbooks to see if he could predict who would get divorced.

In an article for The Wall Street Journal, he said he found that people who smiled least genuinely were five times more likely to get divorced at some point in their lives than those with happy photographs.

To work out who was smiling strongly, he looked at whether the individual in the photo contracted the muscle that pulls up the lip corners as well as the orbicularis oculi, which is the muscle that makes someone’s eyes ‘smile’ too.

Professor Hertenstein said that future divorcées tended not to smile, or if they did, did not contract their orbicularis oculi - indicating a smile that was not genuine.

Together with his team, the psychologist, who is the author of a new book called THE TELL: THE LITTLE CLUES THAT REVEAL BIG TRUTHS ABOUT WHO WE ARE, examined the childhood and adolescent yearbook photos of people over the age of 55 in a small town in mid-west U.S.

As part of their research in 2009, which 
was published the journal Motivation and Emotion, they also looked at 
photographs of participants at birthdays and graduations and concluded 
that the photos predicted divorce as accurately as the yearbook photos 
did.

According to a study by psychologists LeeAnne Harker and Dacher Keltner in 2001, college yearbook photographs can also predict whether someone will enjoy a life with less sadness, anxiety and despair 30 years after the graduate.

The study, published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, found more stoic looking classmates were less well socially connected and had less fulfilling lives than their more smiley classmates.

However, Professor Hertenstein concedes that smiling in photos cannot cause happy outcomes and is not the only valid predictor of them.

He writes: ‘Your smile, or lack thereof, is not the great determinant of your destiny. Individual cases will certainly vary.’
