A Brooklyn man who spent 24 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of murder plans to sue the city for $162 million.

Jonathan Fleming's lawyers told the New York Post that the hope was for the city to quickly settle the suit.

Attorney Taylor Koss said that was a reasonable expectation given the city's history with suits like the one from David Ranta, who spent 23 years in prison after he was wrongfully convicted of murdering a rabbi.

Jonathan Fleming, who was exonerated of murder after almost 25 years behind bars, has filed suit against the city for $162 million

Both Ranta and Fleming's cases occurred on the watch of Charles Hynes, Brooklyn's former district attorney.

Ranta got $6.4 million in a settlement from the city two months after filing suit for $150 million.

In Fleming's case, the 51-year-old was finally set free after prosecutors admitted they had a receipt placing Fleming at a Florida hotel not far from Disney World at the time of the 1989 murder of Darryl Rush in Williamsburg.

He was convicted that year and spent the following 24 years and 8 months incarcerated.

The conviction was vacated by Judge Matthew D’Emic Tuesday citing  a 'careful and thorough review of this 
case, and based on key alibi facts that place Fleming in Florida at the 
time of the murder.'

'The truth is, he’s been struggling,' Koss 
said. 'This money is important to him so he can establish his life 
again.'
