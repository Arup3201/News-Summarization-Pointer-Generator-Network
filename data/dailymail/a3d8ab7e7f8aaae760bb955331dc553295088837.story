British actor Idris Elba has revealed that he was inspired by his own father when playing Nelson Mandela in the film based on the life of the great South African leader.

The star helped lead to the tributes to Mandela last night following news that the anti-apartheid icon had died at the age of 95.

The new biopic, named after Mandela's autobiography Long Walk to Freedom, had special poignancy for Mr Elba because it was the last performance of his which his father Winston saw before he died two months ago.

In an interview with The Sun, the 41-year-old actor said that he had based his portrayal of Mandela on Winston, adding that when he was made up as the president in old age he looked strikingly similar to his own father.

'Ironically I looked just like my old man,' he said. 'I designed my Mandela on my dad.'

Mr Elba has previously said that in order to speak like the former president of South Africa, he imitated the speech patterns of Winston, who was brought up in Sierra Leone and moved to Britain shortly before Idris' birth.

'There are certain ways that African men speak English, and Mandela and my dad sort of fall into a similar category,' he said last month. 'They are very grammar-conscious and like to use long words.'

Voice: The actor said he managed to capture Mandela's speech by thinking of his father's African accent

Winston died of lung cancer aged 76 eight weeks ago, but he was able to watch the film shortly before his death, in what was apparently an 'emotional' experience for the family.

'He must have thought it was one of the last times he was going to see one of my really big performances,' Mr Elba told The Sun. 'It's a sad film and now, when I think about it, it must have been emotional for him. He must have known.'

Mandela died very shortly before the British premiere of the film about his life, and Mr Elba was apparently in tears when producer Anant Singh announced the news to the shocked audience at the end of the showing.

The actor then took to the stage alongside producer Harvey Weinstein in order to lead a moment's silence in memory of the leader.

Mr Elba said: 'What an honour it was to step into the shoes of Nelson Mandela and portray a man who defied odds, broke down barriers, and championed human rights before the eyes of the world.

'My thoughts and prayers are with his family.'

On the red carpet before the showing, the actor - who struggled with racist abuse as he was growing up in East London - spoke of the difficulties in capturing the essence of such an iconic global figure.

'For somone who doesn't look like Mandela you have got to work harder to get the audience in there,' Mr Elba said.

However, he was apparently so successful in portraying the ex-president that when Mandela himself saw footage from the film, he thought he was watching himself in old news footage.

Beloved: The world is in mourning after Mandela died yesterday at the age of 95

'He has seen clips of the film and said he saw [Idris] that he thought it was him,' Mandela's daughter Zindzi said before last night's premiere.

She added: 'When my 11 year-old grandson saw the movie last week I asked him what he thought, and he said: "The dude who played grandad, when he talks he kind of reminds me of him."'

Mr Elba was so dedicated to the role that he persuaded the custodians of Robben Island, the prison where Mandela spent 18 years which is now a museum, to let him spend a night in a cell.

The experience helped him get inside the mind of the South African legend, and made him more convinced than ever that he had to do justice to Mandela's heroism.

'I wanted to do this because I believe in what his message was - that we can all live together,' Mr Elba told The Sun.

The film, Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom, will be released in the UK on January 3.
