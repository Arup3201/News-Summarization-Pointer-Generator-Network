A high school in Michigan has banned the friends of a dying teenage girl from fundraising for her family on school grounds.

Kerrigan Brandon, 15, overdosed on prescription drugs on January 15. She is now in critical condition and doctors have told relatives that she has only days to live

The girl's friends at Roosevelt High School, Wyandotte, produced bracelets that they wanted to sell to help her family with medical and possible funeral costs.

But their school principal won't let them do so at school due to claims that it would 'glorify drug use.'

Tragic: Kerrigan Brandon, 15, may only have days to live after overdosing on prescription pills. But her high school won't let her friends fundraise for her family on school premises

Friends of Brandon planned to sell the bracelets, inscribed with 'Pray For Kear Bear', for $2 and donate the money to the dying girl's family

Brandon, who took a cocktail of xanax,
methadone and cold tablets a month ago, is brain dead, in critical 
condition and fighting for her life in hospital.

The girl's mother told Myfoxdetroit.com that: 'She has no function at all besides to lay
in bed and be supported by a machine.

'That would be her life. They said it could be couple days, at most a week.'

The
teenager's friends knew the Brandon family might need financial support
so planned to sell T-shirts and bracelets that read 'Pray For Kear 
Bear.'

They hoped to make $2 from each bright pink bracelet, money that they would donate to straight to the stricken girl's relatives.

Yet the students told Fox that school officials wouldn't allow them from selling the fundraisers on school premises, as it would promote the use of drugs.

The school principal was not available for comment.

One of the girl's friends told Fox that they wanted to give Brandon 'the full amount of support that we can, and as much money that we can donate to her, for her hospital bills and for her funeral if it has to come down to her funeral.'
