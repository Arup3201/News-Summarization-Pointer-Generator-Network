For centuries people in the Middle Ages lived in fear of vampires.

And now a telling sign of the precautionary measures they took against the mythical creatures has been found in northwestern Poland.

The grave of the suspected terror was found in Kamien Pomorski and has all the markings of a vampire burial.

The skeleton of a suspected vampire has been found in the town of Kamien Pomorski in northwester Poland. The burial is thought to date back to the 16th century, a time when much of central Europe was fearful of vampires rising from the dead and 'sucking their blood'

The body is believed to date back to the 16th century, although the absence of personal effects makes it difficult to date.

It was found during a dig in the cemetery next to the town church.

Its features are reminiscent of similar vampire burials that have been found in the past.

The most obvious sign of this being a vampire burial was the stake through its leg.

Many suspected vampires are found nailed or staked to the ground to prevent them rising from the ground.

‘Initially we thought he had suffered a leg wound,’ dig leader Slawomir Gorka told Kamienskie.

‘But from sifting through the earth underneath, we realised there was a hole likely made from a puncture.'

The mouth was also found without its 
teeth with a piece of brick in their place, which supposedly stopped the
 vampire rising and sinking its teeth into victims.

The mouth of the burial was also found with a small bit of brick rubble in it, which would have been intended to stop the vampire sinking its teeth into people if it did rise from the dead

Finding vampire burials like this is not uncommon, with several discovered in Poland over the last few years.

It is thought that burials of this sort were common in the Kamien Pomorski area from the 13th to 17th century.

According to some beliefs, people who were considered bad during their lifetimes might turn into vampires after death unless stabbed in the chest with an iron or wooden rod before being buried.

These vampires were often intellectuals, aristocrats and clerics.

Upon their death - or even before - locals would take measures to ensure that the suspected vampires did not terrorise their communities by driving stakes through parts of their bodies or removing the teeth from their mouth.

The belief in vampires was widespread throughout Bulgaria and other parts of central Europe throughout the Middle Ages.

The word vampire is derived from the original Slavic term opyrb or opir which later appears as vipir, vepir, or vapir.

Drunkards, thieves and murderers were all believed to be likely candidates to become vampires.

John van Eyssen prepares to drive a wooden stake through the heart of a vampire. The scene was in 1958's 'Horror of Dracula'

Appearing
 completely normal, they would arrive at a town and live amongst the 
people often even marrying and fathering children. But at night they 
would wander the countryside in search of blood.

These types of vampires could be destroyed with a stake through the heart.

One account maintains that a 
vampire was the soul of an outlaw who died in the mountains or forest or
 along a country road, and whose corpse is eaten by crows, wolves, or 
some other such scavengers.

Because
 such a soul is not permitted to enter heaven or hell it remains on 
earth haunting the place where he was killed strangling and drinking the
 blood of anyone who comes by.

Another
 account states a person who died a violent, unnatural death or whose 
corpse was jumped over by a cat before burial, can become a vampire.

In
 such cases during the first 40 days after burial, the bones turn to 
gelatin and the vampire performs mischief at night  - releasing animals 
from their pens, scattering house hold items, and suffocating people.

During
 the first forty days it can be destroyed by a Vampiridzhija - a 
professional vampire hunter capable of seeing them - or alternatively 
devoured by a wolf.

However if not destroyed in this time period the Vampire would develop a skeleton and becomes even more fierce.
