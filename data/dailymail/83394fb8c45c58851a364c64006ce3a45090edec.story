A female zookeeper has been hospitalised for a week after she was attacked by a wildebeest at a North Carolina zoo.

Kimberly Hillman was tossed into the air twice in front of dozens of shocked schoolchildren at Zootastic, Iredell County, in North Carolina. 

Zootastic's owner Scottie Brown said that Ms Hillman tried to shoo the wildebeest away harmlessly when it attacked her.

She was driving through the park with a mother and child who arrived late when she tried to move the animal out of the way.  

He told WSOCTV: 'I radioed her and said I saw the lady so Kim said, "Well, I'll just bring them down in my car." 

'So she brought them down and when she got out of the car she was walking the kids to the wagon. The wildebeest came over and she shooed it.'

However, the wildebeest reacted violently and attacked Ms Hillman, who works as a book keeper at the zoo. 

Mr Brown said: 'She hit [THE] ground, it picked her up again and threw her up in the air, and I was getting off the tractor at the time and I ran and got between her and the wildebeest.

'It happened because she got out of her car and I guess for that matter, it could have happened to the mother and child? Oh yes, yes.'

Mr Brown said it was the first time that anyone had been attacked while at the park. 

Zootastic Park, where Ms Hillman was attacked is just north of Charlotte in Iredell County North Carolina
