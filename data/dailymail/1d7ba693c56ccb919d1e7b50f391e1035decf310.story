Money, work, illness and children - the list of things that can cause stress is endless.

Now research shows one in ten Britons are so stressed they are close to breaking point.

The study, 10,000 people, found that 44 per cent are stressed - and that 27 per cent of these people believe they are often close to breaking point.

One in ten Britons are so stressed they are close to breaking point - 44 per cent of British adults say they are stressed and 27 per cent of these stressed people say they are often close to breaking point

The survey, conducted by Bupa, also showed that stress is a chronic problem with 28 per cent of stressed respondents saying they have been stressed for more than a year.

Stress levels are not equal across the age groups – 45 to 54-year-olds are the most likely to be stressed and the over 55s are the least likely to be stressed.

The survey revealed that 50 per cent of 45 to 54-year-olds are stressed, compared to 38 per cent of over 55s.

Bupa’s findings also revealed that women are more likely to consider themselves stressed than men are – 49 per cent of women say they are suffering from stress compared to 39 per cent of men.

Dr Martin Baggaley, medical director at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, said:‘This research shows stress is extremely common in this country.

The main cause of stress is money worries, following by work, family life and living with a long term illness

‘While low-level and irregular bouts of stress can be beneficial and manageable, it’s concerning to see that so many people are experiencing sustained and relentless stress. 

‘If left unchecked for a prolonged period of time, stress can cause much more serious, long-term mental and physical illnesses such as anxiety and depression, and be a contributing factor in health problems such as heart disease and even obesity.’

The study found that the main cause of stress is money worries, following by work, family life and living with a long term illness.

It also revealed that people in the Midlands are more likely to be stressed than people anywhere else in the country - in the Midlands, 46 per cent of people say they are stressed.

The Welsh are the least stressed – 40 per cent say they are suffering symptoms of the condition.

Worryingly, 30 per cent of men, and 22 per cent of women, say they increase the amount of alcohol they consume to help them deal with stress and 61 per cent of people say they would only seek help if they were no longer able to cope with daily life.

Dr Baggaley said: ‘There is a growing problem of long-term stress in this country, which needs to be addressed. 

‘It’s important that people realise that stress is not just something that you have to put up with. 

‘If you recognise that you are under unusual pressure, try self-help techniques – for example deep breathing, taking exercise and avoiding unhealthy behaviours – these can all make a real difference and help you to feel back in control.

‘If self-help isn’t having an effect, or if you’re concerned about your stress levels or feeling very anxious, you should always talk to your GP or a healthcare professional.’
