Bachelor star Gia Allemand has died after an apparent suicide attempt, her family have confirmed.

They released a statement on Wednesday, stating that Gia was found at her home in New Orleans, Louisiana, by her long term boyfriend, New Orleans Pelicans

Anderson immediately dialed 911 and emergency services rushed to the scene.

It was on Wednesday that life support was withdrawn after her condition failed to improve.

'Due to a critical loss of brain and organ function, life support was withdrawn today,' a statement from her family read.

She also spoke to TMZ, 
saying: 'Gia was a beautiful girl and an unbelievable friend. I’m 
shocked and can’t believe what happened to her. She seemed so happy, but
you never know the demons people are fighting inside. I will never forget 
her and will miss my friend forever.'

Several other stars of the Bachelor franchise have also spoken of the loss.

After her appearance on The Bachelor, Gia went on to find love with NBA basketball player Anderson
of the New Orleans Pelicans.

Gia's last social networking post was on Instagram four days ago.

She shared a somewhat eerie picture of trees, with the words 'legend says, 
when you can't sleep at night, it's because you're awake in someone 
else's dream.'

Just last Monday, Gia posted pictures of herself attending a Bachelorette finale viewing party sponsored by Herbal Essences.

She looked happy as she posed alongside fellow Season 14 contestant Ali Fedotowsky at the bash.

She also posted a selfie snap in which she is seen smiling for the camera and looking gorgeous in a printed white dress.

After the Bachelor in 2010, Gia - a model and actress - later joined the cast of reality series Bachelor Pad in 2010 but only made it to the third episode.

She always maintained that she entered the reality show in the genuine hope to find true love.

'I truly went on the show to find love!' she told Emme magazine.

She will be missed: Vienna Girardi also took to Twitter to express her sadness on Wednesday

A huge loss: Ali, who was with Gia just last week, shared her sadness over her friend and co-star's passing

Pray for her family: The Bachelor Season One contestant Trista Sutter asked fans to pray for Gia's family

Sending love: American Idol contestant Pia Toscano also tweeted her condolences to Gia's family

'A
few months before going on The Bachelor my boyfriend broke my heart. I 
couldn’t date or meet anyone. I was in such a rut so my friends 
submitted me for The Bachelor.'

Gia began her career as a model not too long after she was born.

As a baby she starred in commercials for Johnson & Johnson and Gerber Baby.

In her teenage years, her modelling career took off when she was asked to enter a swimsuit competition.

Last post: Just four days ago, Gia shared a somewhat eerie picture of trees, with the words 'legend says, when you can't sleep at night, it's because you're awake in someone else's dream' on Instagram

That
led to several more, and Gia ended up taking second place in both the 
Miss Hawaiian Tropic competition and Miss Red Hot Taj Mahal Super Bowl 
contest in 2005.

But it was when she appeared in men's magazine Maxim in 2007 she became widely recognised.

Her appearance in the publication led her to then take the tiara in the Miss Bikini-USA's Model of the Year in 2008.

But
Gia's passion was for acting and performing, and in 2010 she was 
cast in the role of famed Hollywood actress Ava Gardner in a film 
produced by Brett Ratner about the life of actor Gianni Russo.

Untimely passing: The University Hospital in New Orleans where Gia passed away on Wednesday

Russo had personally chose her to play Gardner saying, 'Gia looks a lot like Ava, but it's really the passion that she had that convinced me to cast her.'

The same year Gia also appeared in a television pilot called Ghost Trek.

The series pilot was a paranormal reality show with a comic horror theme.

But her most best known TV work was on The Bachelor franchise, and she became a fan favourite when she competed alongside 24 other women for the affection of Pavelka.
