The Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden welcomed a new baby giraffe to the world early this morning - and this one is a girl.

The zoo says 7-year-old mother Tessa gave birth to her calf at 5:40 a.m. Monday. The event was featured live on Twitter.

It’s Tessa’s third calf in three years. 
She gave birth to Lulu in 2012 and to Zuri in 2011. Zuri broke her leg 
in a stall at 7 weeks old and had to be euthanized.

Welcome to the world: The zoo posted photos of the big arrival online but the baby isn't expected to be on public view for several days

Tessa and her mating partner, Kimba, have both been at the Cincinnati Zoo since 2008.

'We’re incredibly excited to welcome another giraffe calf at the Cincinnati Zoo,' said Thane Maynard, Executive Director at the Cincinnati Zoo. 

'Both Tessa and the baby are doing well and will spend time bonding indoors over the next few days.  Tessa is a great mom and the calf appears healthy and strong.' 

Looking good: Tessa delivered a healthy, 125-pound female calf in her indoor stall. While Tessa and the calf spend time bonding indoors, the Zoo will allow guests to view the pair through the viewing glass

'It never gets old. It's always exciting,' said Mike Dulaney, the zoo's curator of mammals, who witnessed the birth.

'Whenever a new life comes into the world like that, especially one that's six feet tall, it's pretty impressive.'

The birth of a female is welcome news for breeding purposes, since a single male can mate with a group of females to produce many young. No giraffes have been imported to the U.S. since 1984.

Last year 47 giraffes were born in North American zoos, according to Laurie Bingaman Lackey, who manages the giraffe population for the Association of Zoos & Aquariums.

The zoo is holding a public naming contest for the newborn. Entries will be accepted through the facility’s Facebook page beginning Tuesday and ending Thursday.

According to the zoo’s Twitter account, all the other giraffes -- including proud pap 'Kimba' -- looked on while Tessa gave birth to the new calf.

Zookeepers said they’ve spent the last month prepping the indoor and outdoor giraffe areas for the new baby.

The zoo said when a baby giraffe is born; it drops to the ground head first – about a 6-foot drop. The landing doesn’t hurt the calf, but it does cause it to take a deep breath.

The new calf was expected stood and began nursing within an hour of delivery.

Giraffe calves typically weigh about 125 pounds at birth and are approximately six feet tall.
