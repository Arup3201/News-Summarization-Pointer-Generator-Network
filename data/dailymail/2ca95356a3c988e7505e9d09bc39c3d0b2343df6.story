Gordon Brown described himself as an 'ex-politician' at a conference, despite being a serving MP

Gordon Brown has described himself as an 'ex-politician' - despite still being an MP.

The former Labour prime minister, who represents Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, made the comment as he took part in an education summit in the Gulf state of Qatar.

Mr Brown has in the past faced criticism over the frequency of his speeches in the Commons since returning to the backbenches.

And Tory MP Henry Smith said the latest 'foreign jaunt' shows he 'can’t even be bothered to turn up to work' for his constituents.

Taking part in a panel discussion, Mr Brown was asked his views 'as a politician', at which point he interjected 'ex-politician'.

He was reminded by the host - BBC presenter Mishal Husain - that he was still an MP, which he acknowledged.

Mr Smith said: 'Crisis talks averted the loss of hundreds of jobs at Grangemouth last week, just a few miles from Gordon Brown’s constituency.

'But where was the Labour ex-leader? He was sunning himself in Mexico, at a beachside hotel in Acapulco.

'Today, Gordon Brown joked that he is an "ex-politician", whilst on another foreign jaunt. But he is still paid more than £65,000 a year to be an MP. Hard-pressed taxpayers are footing the bill.

'Labour wrecked our economy, and now Gordon Brown can’t even be bothered to turn up for work.'

From 2012/2013 Mr Brown earned £1.37million from speeches, the highest-earning politician outside Parliament, although he insists he does not receive the income himself  but ‘all the money goes directly to charity or to fund charitable work by himself and his wife’ Sarah.

He was mocked by MPs today with the SNP's Pete Wishart telling the Commons: 'Can we have a debate about the membership of this House, because we know have the incredible spectacle of the former prime minister, the Right Honourable Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, describing himself as an 'ex-politician'.

'Do you know how you can be an MP and be an ex-politician at the same time?'

Chuckling, Commons Leader Andrew Lansley replied: 'You will understand I can't account for the views of the former prime minister.

'But, as far as I'm concerned... politician is an interesting description. We are, as MPs, we are all here with the responsibility to represent our constituents both in the constituency and, in my view, here at Westminster.'

Mr Brown has been criticised for his attendance and voting record since he quit as prime minister.

He has appeared in the Commons to speak
only six times - three times about Dalgety Bay in his constituency, 
once in relation to Remploy in Fife, once in a debate on phone hacking, 
and once to speak about Britain's new aircraft carriers.

According to theyworkforyou.com, which tracks what MPs do in Parliament, he has spoken in 3 debates in the last year, which is 'well below average amongst MPs'.

It also says he has voted in 117 votes out of 883 since 2010, which equals 13.25 per cent, according to Public Whip.
