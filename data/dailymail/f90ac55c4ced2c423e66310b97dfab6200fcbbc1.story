Tour operator Thomas Cook has ditched the globe logo it first used in 1880, replacing it with a 'Sunny Heart', as the tour operator continues its recovery from near collapse.

The 172-year-old firm unveiled the design alongside a new slogan - 'Let's Go' - spelling the end for its famous motto 'Don't just book it, Thomas Cook it.'

The rebranding is part of a root-and-branch overhaul by new boss Harriet Green, who was recruited last year to save the household name from collapse, after it was bailed out by its banks.

Rebrand: The new 'Sunny Heart' logo will be rolled out in high street stores, hotels, websites and brochures in 70 countries. It will feature alongside Thomas Cook's new slogan 'Let's Go'

The tour operator had been battered by weak consumer confidence in Europe and disruption to holiday destinations such as Egypt, amid the political upheaval of the Arab Spring.

It was eventually forced to cut 2600 jobs and shut some 195 High Street travel agencies as part of Ms Green's survival plan.

The switch to the Sunny Heart follows a year-long trial in Scandinavia, which the firm said met with a positive response from Danes, Finns, Swedes and Norwegians.

Swedish agency Happy, which also worked on the branding of this year's Eurovision Song Contest, came up with the design.

Neither Happy nor Thomas Cook would reveal how much it paid for the new logo, with a spokesman saying only that the cost was 'minimal'.

But the cost of rebranding hotels, High Street stores, websites and brochures in 70 countries - including the removal of the 'globe' logo first used in 1880 - could run into the millions, according to travel analysts.

New 'Sunny Heart' decals were fitted last night to a Boeing 757, which became the first of the firm's planes to take to the skies bearing the new logo as it flew from Manchester to Greek resort Santorini.

Videos accompanying the launch showed holidaymakers at an airport baggage carousel being encouraged to make a 'heart' gesture with their hands.

The symbol is similar to the goal celebration used by Welsh footballer Gareth Bale, sold by Tottenham Hotspur to Real Madrid for a world record £86million this summer.

Mr Bale has trademarked the gesture, but Thomas Cook said it was 'comfortable' with its legal position in using it in promotional videos.

Ms Green has been trying to cut costs 
and will follow up the logo change with a bonfire of brands deemed 
surplus to requirements, whittling down some 30 different names to just 
eight.

The changes mark a new chapter in a history dating back to 1841, when former Baptist preacher Thomas Cook began running tours for members of the anti-alcohol temperance movement.

While Thomas Cook turned to a Swedish agency for the Sunny Heart idea, industry sources said the final version had to be tweaked by the firm's own marketing team.

The design was made 'a little plumper' compared to the original and has also been 'irradiated' by adding a sparkle of light.

The new logo was tested in Scandinavia because the region was one of the few parts of Thomas Cook's global empire that was performing very well a year ago, when the trial began.

It was felt that the British business had too many other distractions to be the testing ground for a new brand.
