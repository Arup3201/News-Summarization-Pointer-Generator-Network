Russia has amassed all the forces it needs on Ukraine's border to carry out an 'incursion' into the country and it could achieve its objective in three to five days, NATO's top military commander said on Wednesday.

Calling the situation 'incredibly concerning', NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove, said NATO had spotted signs of movement by a very small part of the Russian force overnight, but had no indication that it was returning to barracks.

Russia's seizure and annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region has caused the deepest crisis in East-West relations since the Cold War, leading the United States and Europe to impose sanctions on Moscow.

In an interview this morning ousted Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovich described events in Crimea as 'a tragedy', adding that had he been able he would have blocked the referendum that led to the region being annexed.

He added that he was hoping he could convince Moscow to return the Black Sea peninsula to Ukraine.

The United States and Europe have said they will strengthen sanctions against Russia if it moves beyond Crimea into east Ukraine.

NATO
 military chiefs are concerned that the Russian force on the Ukrainian 
border, which they estimate stands at 40,000 soldiers, could pose a 
threat to eastern and southern Ukraine.

Breedlove told CNN: 'Forty thousand doesn’t tell the story, this is a combined arms army with all of the pieces necessary should there be a choice to make an incursion into Ukraine, so supported by fixed-wing aircraft, rotary aircraft, all of the logistics required in order to successfully make an incursion if they needed.

'It’s my opinion that they could move within 12 hours of a go, so essentially they could move right away if given the go.'

Viktor Yanukovich has described events in Crimea as 'a painful tragedy' during his first interview since being ousted as Ukrainian president and fleeing to Russia in February.

Yanukovich said that had he been able to retain power, he would have banned the March 16 referendum that led to Crimea being annexed by Russia, and insisted he was still trying to negotiate with Moscow to return the Black Sea peninsula.

He also admitted that he had been 'wrong' to invite Russian troops to enter Crimea after he fled the country following three months of increasingly violent protests.

Yanukovich said that looking back at how the situation has developed, he felt it was 'very difficult to agree with' the way Crimea had separated from Ukraine.

However he refused to shoulder any of the blame for the loss of Crimea himself, saying it was the fault of the current government in Kiev where, he claims, neither he nor Russia have any influence.

He said the result of the referendum and the subsequent annexation by Russia was simply the result of a protest by the Crimean people against the new Kiev regime.

'I personally cannot accept this,' Yanukovich added.

The comments came in an interview with the Associated Press and Russian television channel NTV. It was conducted in the south west Russian port city of Rostov-On-Don - close to the country's border with Ukraine.

The Russian force has aircraft and helicopter support as well as field hospitals and electronic warfare capabilities.

He said told Reuters and The Wall Street Journal that Russia could have several 
potential objectives, including an incursion into southern Ukraine to 
establish a land corridor to Crimea, pushing beyond Crimea to Ukraine's 
Black Sea port of Odessa or even threatening to connect to 
Transdniestria, the mainly Russian-speaking, separatist region of 
Moldova that lies to the west of Ukraine.

Russia
 also has forces to the north and northeast of Ukraine that could enter 
eastern Ukraine if Moscow ordered them to do so, Breedlove said.

Any
 such actions would have far-reaching implications for NATO, a military 
alliance of 28 nations that has been the core of European defence for 
more than 60 years.

'We are going to have to look at how our alliance now is prepared for a different paradigm, a different rule set... we will need to rethink our force posture, our force positioning, our force provisioning, readiness, etc,' Breedlove said.

NATO foreign ministers meeting in Brussels this week suspended all practical co-operation with Russia in protest at its actions in Crimea and asked military commanders to draw up plans to reinforce NATO members in eastern Europe that are fearful about a threat from Russia.

Breedlove said the ministers had asked him to draw up by April 15 a package of measures that would include reinforcements by land, air and sea.

'We will work on air, land and sea 'reassurances' and we will look to position those 'reassurances' across the breadth of our exposure: north, centre, and south,' he said.
