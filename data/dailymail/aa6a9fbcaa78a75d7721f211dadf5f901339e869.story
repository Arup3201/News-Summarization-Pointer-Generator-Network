Angel di Maria insists Manchester United will fight till the very end to ensure they qualify for the Champions league as the Red Devils prepare for a make or break four game run-in.

Di Maria sat out the win over Tottenham after being sent off for tugging referee Michael Oliver's shirt in United's FA Cup defeat to Arsenal.

The £59.7million midfielder knows the next four fixtures - against Liverpool, Aston Villa, Manchester City and Chelsea will ultimately make or break United's season.
