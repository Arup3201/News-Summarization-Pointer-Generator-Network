A Connecticut prosecutor is dropping a disorderly conduct case against Paul Simon and his wife Edie Brickell two months after the couple fought in their home.

Simon, 72, and Brickell, 48, had been scheduled to be in court on Tuesday but they did not appear and prosecutors told Judge William Wenzel they were declining to pursue the case.

It means that the charges have now been dropped and will be eventually erased after 13 months.

'The prosecution will not proceed with the charges and it will be (discontinued) sometime later today by the judge,' Deputy Court Clerk Emmy Kalmanidis said.

No charges: Paul Simon and his wife Edie Brickell, pictured in court in April, will not face disorderly conduct charges following a dispute in their home earlier this year. Prosecutors are no longer pursuing the case

Police say the couple fought during an
 April 26 argument inside a cottage on their property in New Canaan.

During the argument, Simon had attempted to leave the cottage but Brickell blocked the door and the incident escalated into a shoving 
match, their attorney said.

Brickell told police Simon shoved her and she slapped him.

The
 police report says Simon suffered a superficial cut to his ear and 
Brickell, who smelled of alcohol, had a bruise on her wrist.

But afterwards, the couple played down the fight.

'I got my feelings hurt and I picked a fight with my husband,' Brickell said in a statement. 'The police called it disorderly. Thank God it's orderly now.'

The couple's lawyer also told MailOnline that the fight involved only 'a slight push' and said Brickell had told him that it was only the fourth fight the couple have had in their 22-year marriage.Â 

On May 16, the couple, who married in 1992 and have three children together, told the judge that the fight was atypical of their relationship and that they posed no threat to one another.

Simon was given a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2003 for his work as part of the duo Simon and Garfunkel, which produced hits including 'The Sound of Silence,' and is a member of The Songwriters Hall of Fame.

Brickell, best known for the 1988 hit 'What I Am,' released by Edie Brickell & New Bohemians, won a Grammy this year with comedian Steve Martin for their bluegrass song 'Love Has Come for You.'
