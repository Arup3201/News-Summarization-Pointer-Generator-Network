Boxing Day: Alka- Seltzer, leftovers and bored children. That faint feeling of self-loathing that comes from having spent too much money on things you didn't need or want.

The Christmas manicure that looked so witty is now tawdry and chipped by washing up. The unmistakeable throb of a nascent spot on your chin. Bloat.

My solution is to banish husband and children to the nearest park/ multiplex/football game and embark on my annual post-festive purge.

Sarah Vine brings you something to keep your carb-addled brains entertained: a reminder of all that was fabulous and/or entertaining in the world of beauty in 2013.

Behind the fridge, the oven, the cupboard under the sink: nothing will escape my rubber gloves and bleach. And if I'm feeling really brave, I'll slip into my bio-hazard suit and tackle my daughter's bedroom. A clean house equals a clear mind, and there's no better way to see in the New Year.

That said, I do realise most people will think I'm mad. So, for those of you who will be spending today curled up on the sofa with the remnants of a family-sized box of Celebrations, here's something to keep your carb-addled brains entertained: a reminder of all that was fabulous and/or entertaining in the world of beauty in 2013.

The year began, as it so often does, with a new diet. Popularised by an episode of TV's Horizon and the Mail's hugely successful 2-Day Diet, it involved adopting a reduced calorie intake on two out of seven days.

The benefits are bountiful: lowered cholesterol, lower blood pressure, regulation of blood sugar, improved mental clarity, focus and concentration. Oh, and weight loss, which, let's face it, is all we really care about.

Best of all, though, was the relative ease and simplicity of the thing. After all, everyone can stay off chocs for a day at a time; it's doing it for weeks on end that's hard.

So, while we all bored each other senseless with details of our new regime, a truly terrible portrait of Kate Middleton was unveiled to provide a little light relief.

Somehow artist Paul Emsley made our radiant Duchess look as if she'd been pulling night shifts in a dust factory.

The royal couple were polite about it; not so the critics, who professed themselves truly impressed by the way Emsley had managed to turn one of the world's most beautiful women into an old bag.

One for the vaults, I fear.

At the Baftas in February, some men turned up in beards, causing a frenzy and eliciting endless column inches about the 'return of facial hair'.

Granted, those men included George Clooney, Ben Affleck and Hugh Jackman; but 'man grows beard' is not exactly a new story.

Meanwhile, Dame Helen Mirren dyed her hair pink, an uncharacteristic lapse of taste for which we have yet to receive an explanation.

Even more baffling was Cheryl Cole's decision to get an entire rosebush tattooed on her behind. But then Jesse J shaved her head, Katherine Jenkins ran a marathon in full make-up, Gwyneth Paltrow forgot to wear her pants at the Iron Man premiere and Kate Moss turned up to a party in not much more than her tights - and Cole's bottom rose seemed tame by comparison.

Fad-wise, this year there were plenty. There was the vampire facial, involving blood and needles; teeth grilles (as worn by Rihanna and, less plausibly, Madonna); selfies (photographs of one's perfect body snapped in the mirror of from the perspective of the sun lounger); belfies (a selfie from behind); twerking; and extreme waxing, the latter two pioneered in eye-watering detail by pop star Miley Cyrus.

Selfies (as demonstrated by Maria Fowler of TOWIE, left) and tattoos (right, Cheryl Cole's enormous rose artwork) were big celebrity trends of 2013

As PREDICTED, Kate Middleton gave birth to a baby and then promptly alienated half the female population by 'snapping back' into shape.

Luckily she redeemed herself a few weeks later by stepping out on an official visit with - gasp! - grey roots, which was either an act of PR genius or a genuine oversight. Either way, a triumph.

The year ended on a beauty high: the release of make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury's new cosmetic range, which saw Selfridges' beauty hall mobbed by women desperate to get their hands on Kate Moss's lipstick and J-Lo's cheek-contouring palette.

Not since the launch of Tom Ford's make-up line (which was also devised by Tilbury) have cosmetics been this exciting - and with one advantage: her eyeshadows don't cost £64.

But for all Tilbury's genius, the beauty triumph of 2013 was Nigella Lawson's court face.

Doubtless the experience of having her marital laundry aired in public was deeply unpleasant. But never has a woman looked so utterly fabulous under pressure.

Let's not forget that before she became the queen of cupcakes, she wrote about beauty for a newspaper. If she ever tires of cooking, there's always lipstick.

My prediction for 2014? A Nigella make-up line. Stranger things have happened.
