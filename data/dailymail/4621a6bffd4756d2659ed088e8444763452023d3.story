If seeing The Hunger Games' Peeta and Finnickâ€™s defined muscles and sleek physiques has left you looking at your man and wishing he was rather more fit than fat, maybe he needs an arena makeover?

London-based outdoor exercise company, Fitness Playground, is just one place now running fitness sessions inspired by the mega movie.

Trainers Pete Meldrum and Dan Nixon use the urban environment to whip their clients into shape.

'We use rooftops, tunnels and anything else there is to give you a workout that involves both strength training and aerobic training,' explains Pete.

To coincide with the Hunger Games: Catching Fire film release, they've picked up on the key elements of the Hunger Games tribute training and put together a workout that incorporates strength training, combat training and running.

'We've brought a boxing coach in and introduced some rock climbing sessions as well,' says Dan. 'It's all about making sure that you're training to be functionally fit. You can do all the bicep curls in the world, but that's not the same as having enough upper body strength to climb a tree if you're being chased by someone.'

While normally the boys reckon it can take a couple of months to whip people into the lean, mean, fighting machines you see in the arena, they're planning an intensive five-week Hunger Games-inspired course, Train Like A Tribute, that comprises 3 combat sessions, 2 climbing sessions and 5 strength sessions as well as a physio session, lifestyle consultation and diet plan based on a hunter-gatherer Paleo diet.

'99 per cent of looking that good is diet,' says Pete. 'If you don't fuel yourself the right way, you won't get the most from your training sessions. And there's no point having tight abs if they're hidden under layers of fat.'

If you're not in London - and can't find the Â£160 you'd need to Train Like A Tribute, don't worry. Below, Dan and Pete give us a quick rundown of a workout that you can do without a climbing wall or boxing trainer, at home, or in the park - for free.

The Circuit

'Circuit training is great because you can vary it according to your fitness and if you can really only spare 10 minutes, you can pack a lot in.

We recommend doing each exercise for a minute and taking a rest of anything up to a minute in between exercises. As you get fitter, decrease the rest period so that your heart rate stays up and you're getting an aerobic workout as well as a strength one.

Your exercise circuit should start with squats and lunges as these work the biggest muscles in the body, and getting them fired up is good for burning fat. Then press-ups which will work your upper body, and you also need to work your back. This is trickier, but if you work with a partner, you can try pulling someone up off the ground with one arm (a bit like helping a fellow tribute who's fallen) - this will work your back. Finally, include some bicep curls using bottles of water, and some tricep dips on the side of a bench.

The Combos

Once you've got the hang of these moves, you want to try combining them - and adding in props - because in real life - and in the arena - you never use simply one muscle group.

Lunging with a kettlebell will give you a good idea of the sort of muscles you need to train to swordfight an enemy, while pulling back on a dynaband fixed to a door handle or a railing simulates the action that Katniss uses when drawing back her bow.

The Running

While back-to-back strength training can also give you an aerobic workout, to really get your heart pumping, you need to hit the road. Either intersperse your run with strength exercises - maybe you do a set of squats every couple of hundred metres, or burpees every third lamp post.

Think about how the tributes have to move in the arena. They can be moving at a very slow pace for a while and then, when confronted by danger, they're forced to literally run for their lives. You can recreate this sort of exercise by interspersing a steady jog with sprints.

The Diet

In
 the arena you survive on what you can forage and what you can kill. 
There's not enough time to cultivate rice and potatoes and all those 
sorts of carbohydrate-heavy ingredients, so that's what this 
hunter-gatherer diet relies on. It's basically about eating meat and two
 veg - cutting out all the sugar and processed food that tends to 
clutter our diet.

Think about eating to fuel you for what you're doing that day, rather than just eating the same every day - and, if you're doing it seriously, prepare to feel pretty lousy for two weeks as your body gets used to living without sugar. '

After that, promise Pete and Dan, you'll not only look better, but you'll also have more energy. For more information on the paleo diet, go to thepaleodiet.com.
