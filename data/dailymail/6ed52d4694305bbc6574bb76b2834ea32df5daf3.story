Alastair Cook believes bad feeling will spill over into the Test series after Sri Lanka’s decisive final one-day international at Edgbaston was marred by the controversial run out of Jos Buttler.

Boos rang out around Edgbaston when Sachithra Senanayake, who was reported for a suspect bowling action on Monday, removed the bails to dismiss non-striker Buttler when he had strayed marginally out of his ground.

Umpire Michael Gough asked Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews whether he would like to withdraw the appeal but Buttler was sent packing after being warned for backing up too far in Senanayake’s previous over.

Booed: The decision to dismiss the batsman was not appreciated by the Edgbaston crowd

It was a legitimate dismissal according to regulations but it left a bitter taste with England and Cook said the incident would ‘spice up’ the two-Test series.

‘I’ve never seen anything like that and I was disappointed,’ said England captain Cook. ‘It’s a pretty poor act. It wasn’t as if he was trying to steal a run he was half a yard outside his crease.’ 

Sri Lanka’s Mahela Jayawardene defended his team and said: ‘We always try to play in the right spirit but if the other team is not going to stay within the laws then we had to take the law into our own hands. We told the umpires about this and warned Buttler twice but nothing happened.’
