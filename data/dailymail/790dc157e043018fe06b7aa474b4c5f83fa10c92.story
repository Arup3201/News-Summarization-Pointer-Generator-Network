The defendant (pictured outside Blackfriars Crown Court today), from north London, denies one charge of stalking and one charge of sexual assault

A television personality was sent sinister emails about the murder of Jill Dando from a stalker who later gave her a 'sloppy kiss' outside the O2 arena, a court heard today.

The woman received hundreds of messages from the man, with some referring to domestic abuse and Ms Dando's murder. Other messages suggested she leave her husband to marry him and have his child.

The woman, who is a household name but cannot be named for legal reason, was subjected to a campaign of harassment over social media and email for more than a year during which the man, who also cannot be named, claimed they were having a 'cyber affair'.

The trial at Blackfriars Crown Court today heard how the harassment even saw the defendant visit the TV studios where the woman worked to deliver gifts. It culminated in him kissing her at a public event.

Max Hardy, prosecuting, said: 'This case concerns obsessive behaviour on the part of the defendant directed towards a television presenter.

'This obsessive behaviour manifested itself in the defendant's use of the social network site Twitter, in email communications and attending at her workplace and written communication to her address.

'That behaviour went far beyond the respectful enthusiasm of a fan.

'He caused her significant alarm or distress that had a substantial effect on her day-to-day life.'

The court heard how the defendant began contacting the celebrity about her programmes and she replied out of courtesy, although the messages then became increasingly personal.

The presenter, who is in her 40s, made a statement to police in December last year, shortly before the man was arrested.

Mr Hardy said: 'She recalled the first communication from him being a tweet sent in January 2012.

'She had just been on television and the tweet was saying "you look lovely I simply have to say so".'

She began receiving emails to her work address, again replying to the messages out of respect for her fans.

The messages took another turn in February 2012, when the man began speaking about his personal issues and invited her to go the David Hockney exhibition at the Royal Academy in London.

In the March of the same year, his messages took a sinister turn with an email referring to a segment on Claire's Law, which was brought in to help victims of violent domestic abuse.

He also attached the first chapters of his autobiography and his mobile number asking for her to call him.

She stopped replying to the messages, but days later, on March 15, he wrote to her again with the chilling reference to murdered presenter Jill Dando.

Mr Hardy said: 'The email contained a transcript purporting to be a telephone call from someone called Sue and he referred to the discovery that Jill Dando, the TV presenter, had been murdered.'

The Crimewatch presenter was shot dead, aged 37, outside her home in Fulham, west London, in April 1999.

Mr Hardy continued: '[He wrote] 'I hope that wan't too freaky a start to the day, don't let it be s***e, that's like a one-in-a-million thing anyway. (sic)'

The email was passed on to the station's security and he was blocked from emailing any of its email address.

However, he continued to message her through third parties, the court heard.

Another email, sent in March 2012, described his love for her and blamed a co-presenter for being blocked from the email system.

Mr Hardy said: '[The email] is a declaration of love and adoration for her and suggests that she divorces her husband, marries him and they could have a child together.'

He carried on contacting the woman saying they were having a 'cyber affair' and invited her to use an anonymous messaging system.

The court heard that although the harassment began in early 2012, he stands charged with the crimes from November that year, when stalking became a criminal offence.

Jurors were told the alleged stalker was not accused of threatening violence against the celebrity, although his obsessive communication caused her 'serious alarm or distress'.

The court also heard how in December 2012, he visited the TV studios where she worked to deliver hand-warmers and a Christmas card and letter, but was turned away.

The celebrity chose to go to the police after the defendant approached her at an event at the O2 and kissed her, jurors were told.

Mr Hardy said: 'He thrust a copy of a programme into her hands and asked her for an autograph then, in her words, "landed a sloppy wet kiss on my cheek".

'She tried to shrug it off but over time decided to take it to the police.

'That's what prompted her to install further security measures and alter her activities.'

The alleged stalker, from north London, denies one charge of stalking and one charge of sexual assault.

The trial continues.
