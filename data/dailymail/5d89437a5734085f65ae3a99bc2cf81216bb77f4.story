Costa and Skrtel came to blows throughout Slovakia's Euro qualifier victory against Spain last Thursday

Suarez, who spent two-and seasons at Anfield with Skrtel, sent the defender a congratulatory text 

Costa - who is the current top scorer in the Premier League with nine goals as Chelsea sit at the top of the Premier League table - and Skrtel came to blows throughout the Group C fixture and could be seen barging into each other as well as sharing an exchange in the penalty area.

However, the Liverpool centre back had the last laugh as former Chelsea youngster Miroslav Stoch scored an 87th minute winner to give Slovakia the victory.

Suarez spent two-and-a-half seasons at Anfield with Skrtel before moving to Barcelona in a £75million deal in July.
