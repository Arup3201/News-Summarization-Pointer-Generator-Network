Many city dwellers have resigned themselves to the fact that living in close proximity to pet owners means sharing the sidewalks with their four-legged friends.

But in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, authorities are thinking about banning dogs altogether.

The radical measure, if passed, could ban any canines from walking along a key 10-block stretch of Beaver Falls’ downtown business district.

No dogs go downtown? Officials in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania are toying with the idea of banning dogs from a 10-block stretch of the downtown strip

The Beaver County Times reported that officials in Beaver Falls believe part of the problem is that larger dogs, including pit bulls and Rottweilers, sometimes left tied to parking meters by their owners. City Manager says some of the dogs are ‘as big as ponies.’

Another concern is simply that some owners don't clean up after their dogs.

One elderly resident nearly tripped over a leashed dog as he tried to make his way down the sidewalk, said City Manager Steve Johnson.

The city is still researching a possible ban and council doesn't expect to act on it until later in the year. While some residents applaud the move, others say the city should focus on drug crimes and prostitution in the city about 30 miles northwest of Pittsburgh.

Checkered past: The downtown strip is battling image problems due to drug deals and prostitution

Many businesses along the stretch of downtown have complained that dogs along the strip are unsanitary, and prevent potential customers from strolling along the storefronts.

But the paper notes that even if dogs were banned, the downtown section has a checkered past with drugs and prostitution.

Resident Gary Davis told the Times that the whole endeavour is a ‘waste of time,’ adding that having officers patrolling the streets would be much more effective. 

As it stands, the city is still looking into the parameters on a possible ban, and won’t vote on any until later this fall.
