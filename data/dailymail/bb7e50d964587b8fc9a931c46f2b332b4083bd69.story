Come rain, shine or snow, a military enthusiast has found a way of making sure his children always get to school on time - by dropping them off in his 17 tonne tank.

Nick Mead, owner of Tanks A Lot Ltd driving events company, regularly drives around his sons Ashley, 13, and Danny, 16, in one of his impressive fleet of more than 120 military vehicles, worth £2million.

The 53-year-old from Helmdon Northamptonshire, said people often did a double take when they saw him driving one of his road legal tanks, many of which weigh more than 17 tonnes, around town at speeds of up to 40mph.

The  surprisingly spacious tank, which comes equipped with its own guns, is part of Nick's  fleet of more than 120 vehicles 

The 53-year-old said he often saw people do a double take when they saw him approaching in the armoured vehicle which is road legal

'People often do a double take. They can’t believe it, and when they see the tax disc which verifies it’s road legal, they’re even more gobsmacked,' he said.  

'My children love it, the tanks are a bit of a tourist attraction, but I can imagine they're probably even a bit bored of it now, it's just the norm for them.'

 'Their friends can't get enough of it though; I just think all the attention is funny.'

When taking his sons for a spin to school, the dad-of-two will often drive his 17 tonne FV432 armoured personnel carrier - which  MOT exempt - instead of a car, teasing police and stunning follow motorists by revving its eight litre, two stroke engine and intimidating passers-by with its sheer enormity.

Nick said his children love the tanks but admitted they might even be a little bored by the vehicles which the boys simply considered 'the norm'

Both of his sons have been driving tanks themselves since the age of eight at the family's private farm

Everyone is desperate for a ride in the tanks which make up his fleet of more than 120 military vehicles, especially his sons, who have both been driving tanks on his private farm since they were eight.

Tanks are able to be declared road legal once owners de-activate any weapons and fit road-ready rubber tracks.

If the armoured personnel carrier is over 25 years old it does not require an MOT.

Dependent on size, weight and intended usage, vehicles can also be road tax exempt.

A special H driving licence is then required to drive on British roads.

Nick said: 'When we drive through town, everyone waves as if their hands are going to drop off.

'The police often grin or look the other way and most of them don't know what to do, it's not every day you see a tank rolling into town.

'All the children love to take pictures. It's sometimes difficult when I drive it down hills, we'd had some close calls, and I took the fuel cap off a bus once when it got too close.

'But in my 20 years driving tanks I've never had one crash, I'm always extremely careful, especially with the kids.'

Tank collector Nick bought his first armoured vehicle, a FV433 Abbot for £1750, more than 20 years ago.

Since then, he has amassed a fleet of more than 95 operational tanks - the most valuable being a 1948 Centurion worth an estimate £50,000 - which he uses on his off road military fun park at Spring Farm, Helmdon.

The armoured vehicles have been used for weddings, funerals, in films, stag and hen parties. Most recently, one full size army tank was driven down Oxford Street as part of the DVD and Blu-ray release of The Expendables 3.

But for Nick, running his children to school, or even taking a trip to the shops in an armoured vehicle has become the norm.

The military enthusiast admitted he had the occasional close call when driving the tanks but said in 20 years, he had never had one crash

One of those 'close calls' came after he accidentally took the fuel cap off a bus while driving when it got too close but he said he was always extremely careful

He said: 'My partner Debbie and kids are very supportive with all of them getting stuck in and helping out and getting involved on the farm.

'My partner even instructs sometimes, but I think she likes the more glamorous jobs, such as the film shoots and corporate events.

'But despite what people think, I'm not from a military background; my interest in tanks was a spur of the moment fascination.

'I bought my first tank 20 years ago and it just snowballed from there. I feel blessed to have collected so many military relics from around the world.'
