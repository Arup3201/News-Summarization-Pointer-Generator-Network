Inquiry: Care minister Normal Lamb said the number of cases was 'unacceptable'

Ministers yesterday ordered an 
independent inquiry into why hospitals have been paid to hit targets for
 numbers of patients dying on the Liverpool Care Pathway.

The new investigation will examine how
 hospitals have received tens of millions of pounds to implement the 
controversial system for care of the dying.

Care and support minister Norman Lamb 
said there had been too many cases of patients dying on the pathway 
while their families were told nothing about the withdrawal of 
life-saving treatment.

‘This is simply unacceptable,’ he added.

Mr Lamb said the inquiry would 
‘consider the value of locally set incentives, and whether they are 
leading to bad decisions or practice’.

The decision to order an independent 
investigation follows deepening concern over the LCP, which is thought 
to be used in the deaths of 130,000 hospital patients each year.

The method, first developed in a 
Liverpool hospital and widely in use across the NHS for the past four 
years, aims to ease the suffering of dying patients.

It commonly 
involves heavy sedation with morphine or similar drugs, and the removal 
of tubes providing nutrition and fluids.

But in the past few weeks, a string of
 relatives have contacted the Mail expressing concern about the LCP, 
saying patients have been put on it without their knowledge. Many have 
recovered fully after being taken off the pathway.

Medical critics have said there is no 
scientific method of predicting when death will come, arguing that the 
pathway amounts to a self-fulfilling prophecy, that many patients die 
before they should, and that the system is used to free beds and get rid
 of difficult patients.

Ministers have made a series of 
concessions to critics over the past month, including the establishment 
of an inquiry led by the same palliative care doctors who have been 
instrumental in promoting the use of the Liverpool Care Pathway.

They 
have also changed NHS rules to put a legal obligation on hospitals to 
tell families when a relative is put on the pathway.

Yesterday’s decision to launch a full 
independent inquiry followed a summit between ministers, doctors in 
favour of the LCP, and their  critics, at the Department of Health in 
Whitehall.

The internal medical inquiry into the 
LCP will now be taken over by the independent chairman, who is yet to be
 picked. Critics of the LCP said the review should be overseen by a High
 Court judge.

The decision to call an independent 
investigation is understood to have been heavily influenced by the Tory 
MP for Congleton, Fiona Bruce, who was at the meeting.

Mrs Bruce, a 
mother of two who is an evangelical Christian, said she had refused to allow her father to be placed on the LCP and he is still alive in a nursing home six months later.

After the meeting, Mr Lamb said the independent inquiry would report back to him in the New Year.

On ‘bribe’ payments, first revealed by
 the Daily Mail, which have seen at least £30million given to hospitals 
that hit targets for numbers of patients who die on the pathway, Mr Lamb
 said: ‘We are doing an analysis to focus on the circumstances under 
which these payments have been made.

‘I don’t want any payments to be made for anything other than to improve the experience of death.

‘Payments must not be made unless it 
is absolutely clear that it’s genuinely improving the end of life and is
 not just a payment for putting people on a list or a register.’ One of 
the leading medical figures at the summit was Professor Patrick 
Pullicino, consultant neurologist at East Kent Hospitals University NHS 
Foundation Trust, who rang alarm bells over the LCP in the summer in a 
speech arguing that it had become a euthanasia pathway.

Prof Pullicino said the independence of the 
inquiry would depend on who was in charge of it. ‘If it is a palliative 
care doctor, it means zero, but if it is a member of the judiciary it 
will be very good,’ he added.

Among those at the summit who defended
 the Liverpool Care Pathway was John Ellershaw, professor of palliative 
medicine at the University of Liverpool and one of the leading figures behind its design.
