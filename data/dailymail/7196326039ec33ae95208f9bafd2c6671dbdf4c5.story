New Zealand kept a firm grip on the second Test in Dubai after some timely interventions from their seamers.

Three times Pakistan, 1-0 up in the three-match series, looked to have gained a foothold back in the game with one partnership over a hundred and two half-century stands, but each time they were pegged back.

As a result they closed the third day still 122 runs adrift in their first innings at 281 for six.

A positive start to the day saw Azhar Ali and Younis Khan put on 113 either side of lunch as they moved on from their overnight 34 for two.

But just as they were looking to make significant inroads into their opponents' lead Younis (72) slapped a long hop from James Neesham straight to Mark Craig at cover.

The fall of that wicket did not slow Pakistan's advance, however, as Misbah-ul-Haq then joined in a 50-run stand before the taking of the new ball after tea produced another breakthrough.

Having attacked with a number of in-swingers, Trent Boult got one to move away and take a thick outside edge to remove Misbah for 28 before Azhar's stoic stay was finally ended after more than five hours at the crease.

Leg-spinner Ish Sodhi hurried one through to trap the batsman lbw for 75 but even then Pakistan bounced back once again as Asad Shafiq and Sarfraz Ahmed combined in a 57-run seventh-wicket partnership.

The return to the attack of paceman Tim Southee late on paid dividends as in the penultimate over of the day he induced an edge to slip from Shafiq four runs short of his half-century. 

Trent Boult ended the day on 1-46 with eight maidens, but the one wicket he took was vital
