Microsoft has been forced into an embarrasing u-turn on its Windows software by allowing users to boot into the dekstop and avoid its 'Metro' touch interface.

The firm had hoped the system would boost touchscreen usage.

However, users complained vociferously, forcing the firm to first agree to reinstate the start button, and now allow users to boot directly into the 'old' Windows interface.

Until now, Microsoft has charged phone and tablet makers between $5 and $15 per device to use its Windows system, as it has done successfully at higher prices for many years with Windows on personal computers.

Hardware makers factor the cost of that into the sale price of each device.

That model has been obliterated in the past few years by the fast adoption of Google's Android system for phones and tablets, which hardware makers quickly embraced and now accounts for more than 75 percent of all smartphones sold last year.

Apple Inc's iPhone and iPad account for most of the rest of the mobile computing market.By contrast, Windows-powered phones held only 3 percent of the global smartphone market last year. Windows tablets have only about 2 percent of the tablet market, according to tech research firm Gartner.

The Windows 8.1 system will be available on Tuesday,.

Although Microsoft has been pushing touch-screen controls, the new update is designed to make it easier for those with traditional keyboard and mouse controls.

The firm also revealed major updates to its phone and tablet versions of Windows, and revealed it will make the software free to manufacturers of low cost devices.

New Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella Nadella acknowledged Microsoft's underdog status in the mobile world.

'We are going to innovate with a challenger mindset,' said Nadella in a question and answer session at the developer conference.

'We are not coming at this as some incumbent trying to do the next version of Windows, we are going to come at this by innovating in every dimension.'

'Our vision, simply put, is to thrive in this world of mobile first, cloud first,' said Nadella.

'Our goal is to really build platforms, create the best end-user experiences, the best developer opportunities and IT infrastructure for this ubiquitous computing world.'

Also at the gathering, Microsoft formally announced it has developed a voice activated phone assistant feature called Cortana, a direct rival to Apple's Siri.

The feature has been rumored for some months and a test version was demonstrated at the event by Joe Belfiore, a Windows Phone executive.

The Cortana service, which can take verbal instructions to search the Web, set alarms, make calls and a host of other actions, is still in beta testing but will soon be a standard feature on Windows phones, said Belfiore.

He announced that the latest version of Microsoft's smartphone software, called Windows Phone 8.1, will be rolled out to consumers as a downloadable upgrade in the next few months, and new phones running the software will be in stores by late April or early May.

'Microsoft is facing challenges on the mobile and tablet fronts and need to change their strategy to move the growth needle, this is a good and logical first step,' said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets.

Windows will be free for companies making phones and tablets with screen sizes under nine inches for the consumer market. A license fee will still apply for business devices.

It comes a week after new Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella unveiled new versions of Word, PowerPoint and Excel applications for Apple Inc's iPad. A year's free subscription to Microsoft's cloud-based Office 365 service will be offered on the new devices running the free Windows, Microsoft said.
