Glad for the help: Brooke Mueller is reportedly supportive of the decision to place her sons with actress Denise Richards

She's had a rough week, after her ex-husband Charlie Sheen accused her of abusing drugs and losing her custody of her children.

But Brooke Mueller is actually on-board with the choice to have her sons placed another of his exes, actress Denise Richards.

Despite the unusual situation, TMZ reports the 35-year-old is 'glad' the twin boys - Bob and Max - ended up with the Scary Movie actress and not Brooke's own mother.

The four-year-old boys were taken out of the former reality star's custody on Thursday night after the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services felt her home was an 'unsafe environment' due to her suspected drug use.

Sources told TMZ: 'Brooke feels Denise is a great parent and will give her boys everything they need while she seeks help.

'Brooke is grateful to Denise and knowing her boys are in good hands is allowing her to focus on herself and get better.'

Charlie Sheen also echoed in his support of the custody shift, stating that he would 'fully cooperate and fully participate' in any future proceedings.

'Charlie supports the actions of the Department of Children and Family 
Services,' a statement from his rep read. 'He knows Max and Bob are safe in a stable, loving 
environment with Denise and the boys' sisters.'

Prior to the Department visiting her home Brooke was allegedly 'placed on an Involuntary Psychiatric Hold' days before her twin sons were taken away from her.

RadarOnline reports that the troubled ex-wife of Charlie Sheen spent several days at the UCLA Medical Center before child protective services took away Bob and Max.

Brooke was placed under section 5150 of the California Welfare Institutions Code - which Britney Spears went under back in 2008.

The
5150 allows for a qualified peace officer or clinician to involuntarily
confine someone after deeming they have a mental disorder that makes 
them a danger to themselves and/or others.

A source close to the Mueller family 
told Radar: 'Brooke was taken to the medical center on Wednesday night, 
after she was deemed to be a threat to herself and to others.

'She had been using drugs for days and was not in her right mind. It was a very sad, sad situation.'

It is claimed that Brooke is still in hospital.

However, Brooke is said to be is refusing to seek professional help for her drug addiction.

But the 35-year-old is said to be in denial about the severity of her drug addiction, a source told RadarOnline.

'[She] is completely in denial about how
bad her addiction is to crystal meth. Even after losing Bob and Max, 
she is still refusing to go back to rehab.'

And Brooke's mother Moira Fiore seems to be siding with her troubled daughter - even though the star did not want her children with her mother.

'Everything
is fine, everything is the way it is supposed to be right now, with 
us,' she told RadarOnline.com. 'Brooke is fine, everybody will be fine.'

But the source told the website that Brooke is clearly in need of help, stating: 'The only chance Brooke has of even having visitation with the boys is if she is in a treatment program,' said the insider.

Despite the sad situation, friends are hoping it is the shock Brooke needs to finally get clean and beat her cocaine addiction.

A
source told RadarOnline.com: 'Brooke is in a very, very bad place right
now. She is absolutely despondent that she lost the boys. Maybe this 
will finally make her realise that she needs to get help.'

Good mum: Denise, pictured with her daughter Lola, has said that she will do anything for Brooke's children

Last year, Denise  - who has 
daughters Sam, nine, and Lola, seven, with the actor, as well as adopted
Eloise, two - stepped in to look
after the twins while Brooke endured a stint in rehab and she insisted 
she would do anything for the children.

She
said: 'They're our family and they're Sam and Lola's brothers, and I 
can't imagine growing up without my sister, so anytime she needs help, 
I'm there for the boys.'

'[Sam and Lola] are the best big sisters to [the boys] and they love them.

'I
know it doesn't seem normal, but it is our normal. They're little kids 
and I love children, and like I said, it's our daughter's brothers, so I
can't say no.'

Neither worked out: Charlie was married to Denise for four years (pictured in 2005 in LA) and for three years to Brooke, pictured in LA in 2011
