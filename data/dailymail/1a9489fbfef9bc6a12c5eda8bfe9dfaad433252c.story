The sister of the eight-year-old boy killed in the Boston Marathon bombings was finally released from hospital on Thursday, some 39 days after she lost her leg in the attack.

Jane Richard's family revealed in a statement that the brave seven-year-old had been discharged from Boston Children's Hospital after undergoing 12 surgeries since the April 15 blasts, which killed her brother Martin, 8.

The parents, Bill and Denise Richard, said that they were still heartbroken over the loss of their son but Jane's determination to get better was getting them through.

'While we remain devastated over Martin’s death and all that has happened to us, Jane's determination for getting better is an inspiring source of strength for the entire family,' they wrote.

Torn apart: The Richard family has revealed that Jane, 7, (pictured front) has awoken from surgery and was told that her brother Martin (right) was killed in the Boston bombings on April 15

Denise, 42, suffered head injuries in
the attack, while her husband Bill, 42, was hit by shrapnel. Only their
eldest child, 12-year-old Henry, escaped without injury.

The parent said Jane was in good 
spirits and was 'looking forward to beginning the next phase of her 
recovery,' which will take place at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital 
and involve rehab to regain her strength, balance and stamina.

The family said they all shared 'very
emotional goodbyes' with the doctors, nurses and staff at the 
Children's hospital who 'have taken such good care of not only Jane, but
all of us.'

'Jane and her body will ultimately 
dictate the timeline for her stay at Spaulding,' they wrote. 'Jane's 
stay will serve as a bridge to what will be the "new normal" for Jane 
and our family going forward.' 

The family are holding a Mass in 
Martin's memory at a church in their home of Dorchester on June 9, 2013,
which would have been his ninth birthday.

Earlier this month, the Richard 
family revealed the heartbreaking moment their daughter awoke two weeks 
after the attack and learned her brother had died.

In a statement, the family revealed Jane had 'difficult questions that
needed to be answered.'

'There are not words to describe how hard 
sharing this heartbreaking news was on all of us,' it read.

Amid the tragedy, the family was 
celebrating the progress of little Jane, who has braved a dozen 
surgeries to close the wound on her left leg and to eventually prepare 
it for a prosthesis. She also battled infections in hospital.

'While she has more trips to the O.R. 
ahead of her, last night's operation marked an important milestone,' the May 9 statement read. 'If things go well, Jane could be ready to transition to the rehabilitation stage of her recovery in the next few weeks.'

Bill
is recovering from his shrapnel wound and is hopeful that he will 
regain hearing he lost from the blast, while Denise is recovering from 
her surgeries, but is still missing sight in one eye.

Henry has returned to school, 'which gives him a needed sense of routine and normalcy', the statement, which was uploaded to the family's website, said.

The Richards also took the time to 
thank members of the public and authorities for their help throughout 
'our very darkest hour'.

'We
want to thank the people who quickly got to Jane and addressed her 
injury in the street because they saved her life,' it read. 'We also 
salute those who stood guard over Martin's body so he was not alone. 
Those officers will never know how comforting that was in our very 
darkest hour.'

Jane
Richard is believed to have been standing on the marathon fence next to
the big brother she idolized when the first of two bombs detonated near
to the finish line.

Images from before the blast appear to show 
Bill, a community organizer, holding his youngest children up on the
railings as Dzhokhar Tsarnaev plants his backpack bomb just behind 
them.

Bill and Jane's eldest brother Henry, 12, managed to escape from the bomb attack uninjured.

It isn't clear whether any of the women 
in the photograph is the children's mother, school librarian Denise,
who sustained head injuries and had to undergo brain surgery following 
the attack.

Jane is an enthusiastic Irish dancer having attended classes at the Clifden Academy of Irish Dance in Milton since the age of three, local reports noted.

Neighbors said Jane looked up to her 
older brother and they both attended the Neighborhood House Charter 
School in Dorchester, where their mother served as the school librarian.

Tracey
Monroe, a bystander who came to Jane's aid in the moments after the 
blast, told WCVB.com: 'I saw her laying in the street. I held her head 
in my hands and I tried to rub her and comfort her. I asked what her 
name was and she said Jane.

'She was just a baby and so badly injured and scared. But she was so incredibly brave. I saw him [Martin] and at that point I knew he was gone. I'll never forget them - that little girl, she was so brave.'

The bombs, described by experts as makeshift anti-personnel devices, were made from pressure cookers packed with shrapnel and ball bearings to cause the maximum injuries to bystanders.

Police believe they were planted by brothers Dzhokhar, 19, and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26. After their images were released by the FBI, Tamerlan was killed in an ensuing gunfight with police.

His younger brother was found hiding in a boat outside a home hours later and was treated in hospital for an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the neck. He remains in federal prison in Massachusetts and is charged with using a weapon of mass destruction.
