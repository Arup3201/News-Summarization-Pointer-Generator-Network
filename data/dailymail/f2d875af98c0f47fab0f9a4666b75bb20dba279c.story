These statues may look human but look more closely and you might find a dramatic difference.

The heads of the unnerving figures, dressed in hooded tops and trousers,  were created out of stuffed animals.

Instead of a face on each model there is a bundle of taxidermic ducklings, raccoons, skunks and squirrels.

The statues are works of art by the sculptor Brandon Vickerd, a Professor of Visual Arts at York University, in Toronto.

Most of the stuffed animals were bought from a taxidermist in Toronto but the ducklings had to be imported from China.

He placed the two sculptures - called 
Passenger and Passenger II - in busy areas in Montreal, Quebec, and 
Hamilton, Ontario to observe the reactions of the public

The idea was that passers-by might not notice the difference between the sculptures and real people.

Mr Vickerd said he liked to leave the sculptures in public places without revealing them as pieces of art immediately. 

He said: 'People responded with surprise, then laughter or anger, or where generally creeped out - but at least half took a picture of the sculpture, or of themselves standing beside it. 

'Oddly enough children often noticed the sculptures before adults and would get really excited - laughing and hugging them.'

Instead, he added that he aims ‘to insert an anomaly into the viewer’s experience of the everyday’.

He said: ‘These works make reference to comical cartoon clichés, and contrasts our conceptual understanding of nature with the reality of animals inhabiting our proximity.'

A spokesman for the artist added: '[The sculptures are] playful reflections on the relationship between humans and animals in the urban environment.

'The sculptures will appear to be just another commuter in transit. However, once the viewer gets close enough to glance into the hooded parka they will discover that it is not a person but a series of animals standing on each others’ backs, bundled up in clothing and working together to mimic a human.'
