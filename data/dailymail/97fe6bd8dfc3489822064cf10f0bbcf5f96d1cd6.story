Experts believe the 10p-a-day statins will be offered to up to an extra five million patients

Prescriptions for statins have trebled in a decade, with nearly 60million doled out last year.

The NHS now spends £100million a year handing out the pills to approximately seven million Britons, according to official figures.

And this is set to rise further after next week, when it is thought that the health watchdog will urge GPs to offer many more patients statins to prevent heart attacks and strokes.

NICE will publish guidance a week from tomorrow which is likely to tell doctors that anyone with a 10 per cent risk of developing heart disease over the next decade should be prescribed the medication.

Experts believe the 10p-a-day drugs will be offered to up to five million additional patients as a result, taking the total to 12million.

But many leading doctors remain sceptical about their benefits and point out that they could lead to type 2 diabetes and debilitating muscle pain.

They warn many patients see them as ‘magic pills’ that allow them to gorge on junk food, wrongly assuming they will be protected from the ill effects.

It has also emerged that six of the panel of 12 experts drawing up NICE’s guidelines have financial ties to firms which make statins or similar drugs.

Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre show 58.1million prescriptions for statins were handed out in 2013, up from 55.4million in 2012 and 18million in 2003. Dr Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist and consultant at  the Academy of Royal Medical  Colleges, said: ‘For most patients taking these pills will not reduce their death rate.

‘What is the point? Then you have to add in the potential for side effects and what might happen to their quality of life.

‘What I see with my own patients is that they think they’ve got the magic pill which is an excuse to gorge on junk food.’

Dr Kailash Chand, of the British Medical Association, who stopped taking statins after experiencing debilitating muscle pain, said: ‘Statins are very useful for people at high risk, those who have had a stroke or heart attack.

‘But to prescribe these drugs to those at low risk prompts a real concern we are over-medicalising and over-statinising Britain.’

He added: ‘Statins definitely have side effects – that is what I have seen after 30 years of prescribing them as a GP. To say otherwise is just not true.’

The rise in prescriptions is partly due to an incentive scheme for GPs called the Quality and Outcomes Framework.

It means that they can earn extra money for prescribing statins to patients who are seen as high risk for problems such as heart attacks and strokes.

Family doctors are urged to try to identify patients who may need the drugs when they come in for their NHS health check – a three-yearly health MOT for those aged 40 to 74.

At present, doctors are advised to offer the drugs to anyone with a 20 per cent risk of developing heart disease over the next decade.

But next week’s guidelines are expected to lower this threshold to a 10 per cent risk.

Maureen Talbot, of the British Heart Foundation, said: ‘The prescription of cholesterol-lowering medications has been increasing steadily for many years now.

‘This reflects the efforts that have been made to better identify  people at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease through  initiatives such as the NHS Health Checks programme.

‘Statins are one of the most studied medicines available today. They have been proven to be safe and effective and are vital in helping reduce people’s risk of heart attack and stroke.’

The figures also revealed that the number of prescriptions for antidepressants has doubled in the last decade, from 27.7million to 53.3million last year.

Across the NHS last year, a total of 1.03billion prescriptions were handed out, up by nearly two-thirds in the last decade.
