The new lawyer for the widow of the Boston Marathon bombing suspect insists that she will co-operate with the investigation into the terrorist atrocity.

Joshua Dratel, who has represented several terrorism suspects, joined the legal team of Katherine Russell, who was married to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, last week.

She has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but the FBI are currently interrogating her to find out if she had any clue as to her husband's plans.

Co-operating: Katherine Russell, the widow of suspected Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, is talking to police

The bombing at the marathon's finish line on April 15 killed three people and injured more than 260.

Tsarnaev and his brother Dzhokhar, originally from Chechnya, are believed to have carried out the attacks due to their radical jihadist beliefs.

Mr Dratel, from New York, today said that he joined Russell's legal team to help her navigate the criminal justice system and to protect her interests.

He said she had spoken with investigators and planned to keep co-operating.

'I don't see that changing in the foreseeable future,' he said. 'There's no inconsistency between that and her interests at this point.'

Dzhokhar, 19, is in a prison hospital facing charges that could bring the death penalty. Tamerlan, 26, died on April 19 after a shootout with police.

Russell, 24, had been living in Cambridge, Massachusetts with her husband and two-year-old daughter, but has been staying with her parents in North Kingstown, Rhode Island, since the day her husband was killed.

She has reverted to using her maiden name, switching from her married name of Tsarnaeva.

Among the questions about Russell is what she knew or saw in the weeks leading up to the bombing, and in the days after it.

Two U.S. officials have said that Dzhokhar told investigators the bombs were assembled in the small apartment Russell shared with her husband.

One of her lawyers has previously said she was working long hours and was frequently away from the apartment.
