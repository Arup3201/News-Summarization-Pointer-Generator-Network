The mother of Emma McQuiston, who will become Britain’s first black marchioness, has lambasted Lord and Lady Bath for refusing to attend her daughter’s wedding to their only son.

Miss McQuiston, 27, daughter of a Nigerian oil tycoon, will marry  38-year-old Ceawlin Thynn, Viscount Weymouth, in the orangery of Longleat House, Wiltshire, on June 8.

But the Marquess of Bath – famous for his string of ‘wifelets’ – and his real wife, Hungarian-born Anna Gael, 69, will boycott the ceremony.

Suzanna McQuiston told The Mail on Sunday: ‘They’ve both known Emma since she was three-and-a-half. She’s a wonderful, incredibly beautiful and sweet girl. I just can’t understand it.

‘One thing I would say is that I don’t want people going on about snobbery. Emma has been a regular at Longleat since she was three-and-a-half. Her sister-in-law is Lady Silvy [Ceawlin’s half-aunt]. It’s nothing new to Emma.’

Miss McQuiston, daughter of Nigerian 
oil tycoon Ladi Jadesimi, admits her relationship with Lord Weymouth has
 caused upset, telling this month’s issue of Tatler magazine: ‘There has
 been some snobbishness, particularly among the much older generation.

‘There’s class and then there’s the racial thing. It’s a jungle and I’m going through it and discovering things as I grow up.

'I’m not super-easily offended but it’s a problem when someone’s making you feel different or separate because of your race. I have never had anything horrible said or happen, but it is something you sense. You can just tell with some people.’

Lord Bath threatened to boycott the wedding after Ceawlin (pronounced See-aw-lin) removed some of his father’s famously risque murals from the family’s Elizabethan stately home.

The Mail on Sunday has learnt that the 81-year-old aristocrat will instead be a guest at Heloise Lorentzen’s marriage to professional polo player Sean Wilson-Smith on the same day. Ms Lorentzen is the daughter of Brazlilian philanthropist Cristina Eastwood.

Lady Bath, who splits her time between Longleat and Paris, is thought to disapprove of Miss McQuiston, an aspiring celebrity chef.

‘She has asked her son to call it off,’ a friend of the family said. ‘She seems to think Emma isn’t good enough for him. Emma’s a lovely girl and is understandably hurt by this, as is her family. But Ceawlin loves Emma and won’t be swayed.’

Mrs McQuiston has apparently arranged a peace summit with Lord Bath but is not sure whether she will be able to change his mind.

‘I don’t know, I really don’t know,’ she said. ‘I’m hoping at the last minute they’ll come.’

Before her marriage to Lord Bath in 1969, Lady Bath was Anna Abigél Gyarmathy, a model turned actress best known as the shapely star of some of the most erotic films of the 1960s and 1970s.

In Therese And Isabelle in 1968, she stripped naked and simulated lesbian sex. She also disrobed for Zeta One in 1969, described as ‘the ultimate erotic extravaganza’. And in Take Me, Love Me Nana in 1970, she played a prostitute.

She became known as the ‘Naked Lady of Longleat’ while a newspaper cutting from 1970 called her ‘the most remarkable thing to happen to the English aristocracy since Lady Godiva rode bareback into town’.

Lord Bath fell out with his son after discovering he had taken down murals painted for Lord Weymouth and sister when they were children. The row is so fierce that the pair live in separate wings at Longleat and rarely meet.

‘As far as I can tell, Alexander likes Emma very much and we’re still friends,’ Mrs McQuiston said. ‘He’s terribly angry about having his murals taken down.’

Lord Bath told The Mail on Sunday: ‘It’s my life’s work and he’s quietly binned it. It’s killed my relationship with him and I don’t feel inclined to pay any interest in his wedding.’
