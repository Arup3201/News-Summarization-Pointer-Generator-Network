Samantha Cameron got into the festive spirit today by pulling on a Christmas jumper to launch Save the Children’s Woolly Wonderland.

The Prime Minister's wife, who is an ambassador for the charity, was joined by Myleene Klass at the 10-day Christmas pop-up event to support Christmas Jumper Day at Westfield, Stratford.

The duo got creative with pupils from Manorfield School by helping them decorate their very own Christmas jumpers during a customisation workshop led by knitwear experts Wool and the Gang.
