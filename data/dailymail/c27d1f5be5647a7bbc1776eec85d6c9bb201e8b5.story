A valiant tradie has snared one of the most venomous snakes in the world using nothing but a a plank of wood, a broom and his bare hands.

Terrifying footage uploaded to YouTube yesterday shows the eastern snake-the second most venomous in the world- writhing around as the man holds it onto the floor with a broom.

The catcher, identified as Rob in the video, appears unperturbed as he grabs the deadly serpent’s head with his bare hands inside a workshop at Milton Downs, a farm in northwest Sydney.

The man behind the camera is less at-ease, urging his friend to be wary:

‘It could kill you bro,’ he says, to which Rob calmly replies: ‘f*** yeah.’

Native to Eastern Australia, the eastern brown snake is notorious for its speed and aggression, rising in an upright S-shape when provoked.

Their venom can cause convulsions, paralysis and cardiac arrest. If left untreated, the bites can be fatal.

Earlier this year, a two-metre eastern brown-believed to be the largest one ever caught in Australia-was discovered a suburban backyard on the Central Coast of NSW.

Dubbed Gigantor, the 2kg serpent was almost triple the weight of an average Eastern brown snake.

The snake will play an integral role in The Australian Reptile Park's life-saving venom milking program.
