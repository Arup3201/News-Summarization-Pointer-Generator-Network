QPR misfit Adel Taarabt has had hopes raised that he could yet secure a return to AC Milan.

The Italians are looking for replacements after Stephan El Shaarawy broke a metatarsal in his right foot. The Milan forward, who was linked with a surprise move to Everton last week, will miss the next two months of the season.

Taarabt had a productive loan spell at the San Siro last season and has been keen to return. QPR rejected an approach from Torino last week and there has also been interest from the Middle East. However, they want around £3million for the 25-year-old Morocco international.

Milan are also considering a move for Roma's Mattia Destro who has been offered to English clubs but none have taken up the bait so far.

Wolfsburg have also been offered Destro as they stall over Chelsea's asking price for Andre Schurrle.

Despite Schurrle's father Joachim and his agent Ingo Haspel visiting London for talks, Wolfsburg sporting executive Klaus Allofs has continued to play down the prospect of Schurrle signing for them with Borussia Dortmund also interested in the 24-year-old.

Allofs said on Monday: 'There's nothing to [the speculation]. Even if we were interested, we'd certainly not be alone.'

Chelsea want around £30m for Germany World Cup winner Schurrle and have had interest from four other clubs but the valuation is proving an obstacle.

Wolfsburg are continuing to field enquiries for Kevin de Bruyne. They know Manchester United and Manchester City have watched the Belgium international while Bayern Munich have also expressed an interest to the player's camp.

Meanwhile, QPR will ask for Frazier Campbell to be part of any Jordon Mutch deal with Crystal Palace. 

West Ham have revived their deal for Hamilton left-back Stephen Hendrie.

The 20-year-old is poised to fly down to London and undergo a medical later this week ahead of finalising terms. Reading and Bournemouth have also shown an interest in the Scotland U21 international but he had his heart set on a move to Upton Park. The deal looked to be off last week when Hamilton vice-chairman Ronnie McDonald criticised West Ham for stalling over seeing the deal through after making an initial offer to club and player.

However, David Sullivan has smoothed over negotiations and a transfer is back on for one of Scotland's most promising defenders.

Hamilton had shown an interest in West Ham's Dan Potts but Blackpool are hopeful of clinching his signature instead. The 20-year-old left-back is the son of former West Ham captain Steve Potts.

West Ham are also continuing talks with Darren Fletcher.

Manchester United will allow the 30-year-old to leave on a free transfer and will contribute to his salary but there is still some negotiating to be done to reach the desired contract. It may take until the weekend for it to be resolved.

Fletcher is cured of his ulcerative colitis and is looking to make up for lost time with his next move. The Scotland international is a popular figure at Old Trafford but wants to play regular first team football.

West Ham midfielder Ravel Morrison is due in Rome on Tuesday ahead of a medical with Lazio.

The 21-year-old has agreed to join the club in the summer and is due to sign a pre-contract if all goes to plan.

Morrison has been offered a four year contract.

Bolton are signing Lorient striker Alain Traore on loan.

The deal was agreed on Tuesday morning as Neil Lennon looks to add some pace into his attack. The 27-year-old Traore, a Burkina Faso international, was also on West Brom's extensive list of potential targets.

He can play as a forward or attacking midfielder and on the left wing. Apart from pace and good technique, Traore is adept at taking free-kicks which will provide extra ammunition for Emile Heskey, Eidur Gudjohnsen and Co.

Wigan manager Malky Mackay was among spectators at Leigh on Monday night as Manchester United U21s beat Liverpool U21s 2-1. Mackay is keen to see what is available on loan with United's Nick Powell and Jesse Lingard among those being considered. 

Powell, who scored in the game, has had loan spells at Wigan before and has also drawn interest from Derby and Bolton in recent weeks. However, his loan at Leicester was cut short amid concerns over his attitude and Mackay will consider that as he faces a relegation scrap.

Liverpool are ready to allow winger Sheyi Ojo to go out on loan too. Liverpool U21 manager Michael Beale said: 'There’s a lot of interest around him in terms of loan. We’ve got to make sure it’s the right thing for Sheyi and if he goes out that he’s going to play.'

Crystal Palace have been offered Togo forward Serge Gakpe from Nantes. The 27-year-old is out of contract in the summer and Nantes are looking to generate bids now. The player has a three year contract offer from Torino for the summer. French-born Gakpe can play as a secondary striker or on either wing.

Palace hope to wrap up the signing of Lille left-back Pape Souare after Senegal's game with Algeria in Guinea.

Swansea are considering Franck Tabanou from St Etienne. The 25-year-old left-sided defender who can also play left midfield is available for around £3.5m. His agent Philippe Lamboley said: 'The two clubs are in discussions, but I cannot confirm a bid has been made.'

Swansea are maintaining interest in Rubin Kazan midfielder Yann M'Vila also although a proposed loan was off at one stage over the weekend.

Stoke City midfielder Jamie Ness is drawing attention from Championship clubs during his loan spell at Crewe.

The 23-year-old Scot has impressed at Gresty Road and Crewe have extended his loan until the end of the season.

Ness, formerly of Rangers, has two Scotland U21 caps. Leeds United, Wigan and Sheffield United have watched him recently.

Meanwhile, Doncaster Rovers' midfielder Marc de Val is set to return to Spain by joining Cordoba on a free transfer.

Birmingham and Middlesbrough have made enquiries about taking Graham Dorrans on loan from West Browmich Albion. Fulham and Burnley have also asked about Dorrans's situation but Albion will only consider a permanent deal as they look to finance incomings.

Callum McManaman is due to have a medical on Tuesday ahead of joining from Wigan while Tony Pulis has also asked Alex McLeish about Genk midfielder Kara Mbodj but Albion's priority is to bring in another central striker before the window closes.

Manchester City will not be pursuing a deal for Eric Bailly at Espanyol. The Ivory Coast centre-back has been offered to City with a deal proposed that would see the defender then loaned back out. However, City have decided against getting involved although the player is regarded as one with potential.
