A British woman in her 20s was arrested after losing her temper with cabin crew who caught her locked in an aeroplane toilet with a man she had just met.

The apparently drunk tourist is said to have been handcuffed to a chair by flight attendants – to the horror of her parents, who were travelling with her.

She was on an 11-hour Virgin Atlantic flight from Gatwick to Las Vegas last week when she reportedly struck up a friendship with the man sitting in  the next seat.

They disappeared to the aircraft toilet and other travellers soon complained of hearing noises from inside.

Cabin crew were forced to intervene after a drunken British woman had sex with another passenger on board a Virgin Atlantic flight

Another passenger told The Sun: 'She started getting heated with the guy next to her.

'They went into the bathroom and people could hear loud noises. The cabin crew forced to door open, then she really kicked off.'

The paper reported the incident happened on a flight from London Gatwick to Las Vegas in the US last week.

The woman was questioned by police but released with a warning before continuing her holiday in the notorious Nevada resort.

It comes 
just week after an Australian was arrested for apparently mistaking the 
cockpit door of a Virgin 
Australia flight from Brisbane to Bali for the toilet, triggering a hijack scare.

Matt Lockley told Bali police that he banged on what he thought was the toilet door of Boeing 737-800 aircraft, sparking the terrorism fears.

Mr Lockley, 28, was later released without charge.

Last year, Virgin America launched a new service that allows passengers to send drinks, a meal or treats to fellow passengers in a move which many said encouraged mid-air flirting.

Virgin Atlantic said last night they do no accept bad behaviour by any passengers on board their planes.
