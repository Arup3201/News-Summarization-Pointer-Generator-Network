Gary Lineker has claimed Wayne Rooney was never destined to be an all-time great.

The Manchester United striker has struggled to reproduce his best form for both club and country recently with opinion divided over his best position.

And Lineker believes the 28-year-old's best days are behind him.

In an interview with talkSPORT to be broadcast on Thursday night between 10pm and 1am, he said: 'During his first major tournament, Rooney was a huge success and looked like being a superstar. 

'We’ve seen a lot of great things from him over a long period. There’s no question he’s a terrific player.

'[But] he’s not gone on to become a Cristiano Ronaldo or Lionel Messi. Realistically, he was never going to be one of the all-time great players.

'At the same time, he’s one of the best English players we’ve had, there’s no doubt about that. He is world class.

'Whether we’ll see something better from him in the future is unlikely. Statistically, your prime years are between 22 to 28-years-old, after that you gradually peter out.'
