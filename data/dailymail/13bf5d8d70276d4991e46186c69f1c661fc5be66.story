Members of Congress waved pencils in the air on Tuesday night as they paid tribute to the victims of the Charlie Hebdo terror attack during President Barack Obama's State of the Union address.

Speaking to a joint session of Congress, Obama, 53, declared that America stands 'united with people around the world who've been targeted by terrorists', including the 17 recently slain in France.

At the same time, dozens of people in the House chamber raised unsharpened yellow pencils into the air in a show of support for free speech following the brutal January 7 attack on the magazine.

Four hundred pencils had been brought to the address by Rep. congresswoman Gwen Moore, who believed Congress had an opportunity on Tuesday to condemn the massacre with one voice.

The Wisconsin Democrat 'held up a yellow pencil' herself 'to honor those who lost their lives in the pursuit of open ideas and free expression,' her spokesman, Eric Harris, told DailyMail.com.

Speaking before the speech, Mr Harris said he hoped the number of those involved in the display would be 'in the hundreds', saying:  'We've invited all our Republican colleagues.'

He added: 'The congresswoman will have pencils with her on the floor. We're bringing 400. The gesture is not meant to insult Muslims nor is it an attack on Islam.'

There are 534 members of Congress, including the 100 senators who shoehorned themselves into the crowded hall. (One seat was vacant after former New York Rep. Michael Grimm's resignation.)

At 4pm on Tuesday, Mr Harris said that nearly three dozen members of Congress had confirmed they would be participating in the Charlie Hebdo salute, which was broadcast live on television.

However, it is currently unknown exactly how many members of Congress ended up doing so. The pencils were deliberately unsharpened due to security concerns.

Twelve people, including two police officers and five Charlie Hebdo cartoonists, were gunned down when two Islamist gunmen stormed the magazine's offices  and opened fire.

The following day, a French policewoman was shot dead in France's capital. And on Friday, four hostages were killed when another Islamist terrorist seized a Jewish grocery store. 

Addressing Congress, Obama, whose wife, Michelle, was seated in a box with nearly two dozen specially-invited guests, said: 'We stand united with people around the world who’ve been targeted by terrorists – from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris.

'We will continue to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we’ve done relentlessly since I took office to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies.'

But he acknowledged that America has 'learned some costly lessons over the last thirteen years.' 

Speaking to DailyMail.com before the address, Mr Harris explained that French citizens have turned ordinary pencils into protest implements in the weeks since the Charlie Hebdo attack.

Holding a pencil above ones head is now an internationally recognized disapproval of censorship.

From Paris to Barcelona to London, pencils lifted skyward have carried a message of support for what Charlie Hebdo stands for – an irreverent and unapologetic mocking tone toward anyone and anything of importance.

'We'd like to do it every time the president refers to the victims, and every time he refers to freedom of speech or expression,' he said. 

The idea for a pencil protest began as a Democrats-only stunt, passed in secret from press secretary to press secretary.

Then an email from Mr Harris to his colleagues was leaked to National Journal. Suddenly it was a bipartisan idea, open to both sides of the aisle.

'This is something we just planned to do privately, and then it would just be a surprise during the State of the Union,' Mr Harris told DailyMail.com.

'But because my email was leaked – that's just how it goes. I should have just put "confidential" on top of it,' he joked, 'and made sure it leaked in about ten seconds.'

Separately, the House of Representatives passed a resolution on Tuesday officially condemning the Charlie Hebdo attack and a separate deadly act of terror at a Paris kosher supermarket.

'Seventeen innocents lost their lives, and this resolution carries our condolences to their loved ones,' House Speaker John Boehner said in a statement. 

'With this condemnation also comes a commitment to stand with France and our allies in confronting the grave threat radical Islam poses to our security and way of life,' he said.
