Artifacts from the heady days of the Californian Gold Rush have been unearthed by workers digging San Francisco's multi-billion dollar transport terminal.

They include clay opium pipes from a Chinese laundry, French perfume bottles, a chipped porcelain chamber pot found in an outhouse and animal bone toothbrushes.

City archaeologists and residents are excited by the 70 artifacts discovered beneath their feet during the excavation of the $3.9 billion (£2.5bn) Transbay Transit Centre.

The old demolished terminal stood on the same site once inhabited by working-class Irish immigrants and Chinese labourers who lived back to back on the sand dunes of the busy Gold Rush port known as Yerba Buena Cove.

They were the Donahues and the 
Dollivers, the Wings and the Lings, and the now-seemingly quaint 
accoutrements of their lives are being unearthed.

There
are clay opium pipes and ceramic teapots from China; French perfume 
bottles; dainty English serving dishes, apothecary jars and the heads of
hand-painted porcelain dolls and abandoned chamber pots.

They
all date back to the mid-to-late 1880s, when the cove was reclaimed and
clapboard houses went up on Mission, Natoma and Minna streets, between 
First and Beale.

They were filled with Irish, Swedish, German and Italian immigrants, as well as the Chinese who had come during the Gold Rush and then stayed on to help build the railways and bridges.

The million-square-foot sleek and modern bus and railway station being built in the South of the Market financial district is billed as the 'Grand Central Station of the West'.

It will serve as the northern end of California's planned high-speed rail line between San Francisco and Los Angeles.

Today's residents and workers can see 
the exhibit in the lobby of the building that houses the Transbay Joint 
Powers Authority. The artifacts are accompanied by historic
photos and documents.

An 1885 article from the San Francisco 
Chronicle reveals Irish landlords JS and Mary W Dolliver were seeking 
500 dollars in damages from Ah Wing and 11 Chinese tenants for the 
'offensive smells from the laundry that injured the rental value of
the plaintiff's premises'.

The California Gold Rush began at Sutter's Mill, near Coloma On January 24, 1848.

John Marshall found shiny metal in the tailrace - a man-made channel carrying water - of a lumber mill he was building for pioneer John Shutter on the American River.

After tests showed that it was gold, Sutter wanted to keep the news quiet because he feared  his plans for an agricultural empire would be ruined.

But rumours soon spread and were confirmed in March 1848 by San Francisco newspaper publisher and merchant Samuel Brannan.

After he had set up a store to sell  prospecting supplies, he strode through the streets  holding aloft a vial of gold, shouting, 'Gold! Gold! Gold from the American River!'

Soon, waves of immigrants from around the world, later called the 'forty-niners', poured in.

As Sutter had feared, he was ruined - his workers left and squatters took over his land and stole his crops and cattle.

Ming Ng, a Chinese engineer with a firm that hopes to work on bus storage for the new terminal, visited the exhibition.

'It's very interesting to see the pottery compared to the metal things that are all rusted and ruined,' he said, looking at a pristine blue-and-white Chinese teapot.

'The pottery looks almost new.That's the Chinese character for longevity.'

James 
Allan, an archaeologist with William Self Associates, the firm ensuring 
the items are unearthed and preserved, said: 'It's not often that you get a chance to 
have a window into what used to be.'

Mr Allan said the artifacts were not necessarily unique and that they expected to unearth hundreds more.

'What is unusual is that we were able to identify the people and occupations of the early Gold Rush,' he said.

'When
the Gold Rush started in the 1850s, the miners came here and there was 
no place for them to live, so they lived in the sand dunes and then tent
camps.

'We found the evidence: a wooden floor and a lot of bottles, barrels, a privy, leather shoes and boots.'

They
would have worked in the Risdon Iron Works - which built pipes for 
Hawaiian plantations - the Selby Smelting Works, Miners Foundry or the 
San Francisco Gas and Light Co.

Mr
Allan said his favourite find was an oblong, earthen storage jar found 
fully intact. The unglazed pot with a thin neck and bulbous belly was 
used to store grain, olives or water.

'It's the equivalent of today's plastic water bottle in that they were used, and used, and then thrown away,' he said.

He
also liked a porcelain chamber pot found at the bottom of an outhouse. 
It might have been part of a toiletry set sold by Sears back then for 
2.25 dollars (£1.44).
