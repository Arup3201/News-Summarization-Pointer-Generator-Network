Stoke City are keen on Tom Ince who is due to give an answer to Hull City about his proposed move.

The
 22-year-old has agreed a contract with the Tigers and had seemed poised
 to sign for Steve Bruce's side but Stoke has shown late interest in the
 winger.

Whichever
 club he decides to sign for will have the fee determined by a tribunal -
 with former club Blackpool likely to ask for £8million due to the fact 
Crystal Palace paid £1.5m in January for a five-month loan.

On the move: Tom Ince has agreed a contract with Hull City but Stoke City retain an interest

International honours: Ince represented the England U21s earlier this summer

Ince turned down the chance to move to Inter Milan last month.

Hull boss Bruce has already been active in the transfer market this summer after making Jake Livermore a permanent signing from Spurs following an impressive loan spell at the KC Stadium last season.

The Tigers have also completed a £7m deal for Norwich midfielder Robert Snodgrass.
