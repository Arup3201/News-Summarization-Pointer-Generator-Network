Former Newcastle and Colombia striker Faustino Asprilla has backed Radamel Falcao to be a success at Manchester United despite his recent injury problems.

The 28-year-old, who moved to Old Trafford on loan from Monaco on transfer deadline day, missed the World Cup and has barely played this year after suffering anterior cruciate ligament damage in January.

But Asprilla believes Falcao will prove to be an excellent signing for Louis van Gaal after returning to full fitness.

Speaking about his compatriot with Sky Sports, Asprilla said: ‘I think it’s fair to say Falcao’s move to Manchester United took everybody by surprise but I’m sure they have selected the right man to help the team.

‘He (Falcao) is a great goalscorer, a natural finisher and he is among the best in the world in that position.

‘He will be fine (physically) because he has had ample time to recover and his therapy has been great so he should be 100 per cent.

‘I’m sure he will do very well for Manchester United.’

Falcao could make his United debut when United host Harry Redknapp’s QPR on Sunday.
