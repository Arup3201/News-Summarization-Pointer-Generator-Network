This is the fascinating sneak preview of the beautiful English countryside on which the opening ceremony of the London Olympics will be staged.

Visitors to the grand event in Stratford, east London, will marvel at a spectacular show that reflects Britain's charming and picturesque heritage.

The aerial photograph reveals a pretty maypole, water mill, orchard and pasture inhabited by 70 grazing sheep. A village cricket green, orchard and farmers' cottage complete the entrancing scene.

Beautiful sight: A lush recreation of the English countryside in east London will be the stage for a moving show by talented director Danny Boyle

A mosh pit lies at the edges of the rolling fields, close to an expanse of ploughed land, and 60,000 spectators will surround the circular stage in tiered seating.

Director Danny Boyle's magical set is expected to focus on the country's rich history, with towering chimney stacks and cotton looms expected to rise out of the green pasture as the narrative takes a trip back in time to the Industrial Revolution.

The £27million ceremony will be watched by a thrilled global TV audience of more than a billion. They will get to see history in the making as the green and pleasant land literally gives way to the darker depths of the past.

Boyle's incredible display is expected to paint a grim picture of Britain's satanic mills, with a factory chimney the centrepiece of the set beneath the attractive countryside, delving into England's coal-powered age.

It was yesterday revealed that national 
treasure Sir Paul McCartney, who was the headline
attraction at the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee concert last month,  will belt out Hey Jude in a high-voltage 
finale to the lavish ceremony.

who appears to be holding a wand and (right) a towering chimney stack

The dramatic images of the 
industrial foundations to the set were caught by a cameraman in an 
airship which passed near the stadium. There appeared to be a coalmine in the scene, as well as a water wheel and a cauldron.

The river snaking through the majestic set resembled the aerial image of London in the EastEnders credits.

A giant figure was positioned in the 
middle of the field, which was still covered in tarpaulin when the 
picture was taken. The 80ft structure appears to be holding a staff or 
wand.

In front of the 
figure stood the enormous factory chimney while behind it is is a huge 
metal cog, upon which are laid wooden sleepers, perhaps a reference to 
the steam age.

The ceremony, which is expected to be viewed by a global TV audience of more than a billion, will use more than 13,000 props while a million-watt amplifier will provide the sound.

and railway sleepers might be a reference to Britain's steam-powered 
past and, right, what appears to be a cauldron

Hillock: The set will include a recreation 
of the Glastonbury Thor and an enormous fake tree, which will appear in 
the first scene, entitled 'green and pleasant land'

Among
the more unusual items on show were three enormous iron-framed beds, one
of which has a pirate's hat and a hook lying on it which might indicate
the use of the Captain Hook character from JM Barrie's Peter Pan.

Among the 10,000 volunteers involved in the performance are a group of NHS nurses.

There will be three final rehearsals for the opening ceremony in the Olympic stadium the week before the Games, featuring up to 60,000 people, including 900 schoolchildren.

The volunteer performers are not being paid but will receive travel and food costs, and officials have sent out letters warning those taking part not to divulge any information about what they are doing.

Layer cake: The stadium is being transformed into a microcosm of Britain for the fascinating show

Model city: Giant models of the Gherkin, the Houses of Parliament and the Royal Albert Hall are to feature in the Opening ceremony

Boyle, who directed the 
multi-Oscar-winning film Slumdog Millionaire, said the aim of the 
ceremony was to create 'a picture of ourselves as a nation', and to 
ensure it is authentic there will even be giant fake clouds which will 
pour with rain.

Such is the pressure to get the 
ceremony perfect that officials have warned that any children unable to 
make every practice session will be prevented from performing.

The
largest harmonically tuned bell in the world, which has been specially 
forged at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry will ring to mark the start of 
the ceremony. It is over 6ft tall and weight 23 tons.

Adidas has launched a new TV advert with less than a month to go to the Games as part of its ‘Take the Stage’ campaign. 

The
video featuring Jessica Ennis, Phillips Idowu, Louis Smith and Tom 
Daley will be followed by extra 30 second TV ads featuring moving 
personal accounts from Team GB's top athletes.

Heptathlete Ennis describes the 
pressure as one of the nation’s ‘Golden Girls’.

The advert visits her 
home town of Sheffield, where viewers see the huge support for Jess, 
with a banner hanging out of one window claiming, ‘The Only Way is 
Ennis’.

Idowu talks about growing up
in Hackney, the impact of the local community and how he will look give
back to them by aiming for gold as he takes the stage in the triple 
jump.

Gymnast Smith tells the story of how he was regarded as an underdog at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, yet came away with a medal.

Diver Daley talks about his coming of age since competing in Beijing 
at 14 years old.

The ad looks at his fans - Daley’s Angels - and his 
desire to give the nation something to cheer about.
