Martin O’Neill has warned Roy Keane to expect a Champions League baptism of fire should he agree to step into the Celtic hotseat.

Dermot Desmond, Celtic’s largest shareholder, has held ‘informal talks’ with the former Manchester United captain concerning the Parkhead job vacated by Neil Lennon.

The Scottish champions insisted last night Keane has not been offered the job and released a statement claiming they are still talking to ‘a number’ of candidates.

And O’Neill made it clear he wants his right-hand man to stay. Indeed, with just eight weeks until a crucial Champions League qualifier at Murrayfield, he urged Keane to consider the implications of stepping into a high-pressure situation.

‘Celtic are back so early because they’re involved in those big (European) games,’ said O’Neill. ‘So it is a case of that being only a matter of days away rather than weeks - and I’m sure that’s something to consider.

‘It was only brought home to me the other day when Anthony Stokes was mentioning he would not be coming with us to America because he would have had no break because Celtic are back training very, very quickly because he’s had no break whatsoever.

‘If Roy is actually offered the job then he’ll have things to consider. The very obvious thing to consider is the speed at which he would go into a big football club and have big, big games right on his doorstep.’

A Celtic manager for five years, O’Neill remains an iconic figure at Parkhead and will advise his right-hand man carefully.

He admitted: ‘I have spoken to him. I had a call the other day from Dermot Desmond wanting to speak to Roy if it was at all possible, and I mentioned it to Roy, of course.

‘I am sure he was wanting to have chat anyway because a club like Celtic might not come around too often.

‘It was just a really informal chat, I think, but if you are asking me would I be really disappointed? Of course if Roy was to leave us.

‘But I kind of felt that when I took him on in the first place, that over the course of the next 18 months to two years, that this thing was likely to happen.

‘He was coming right back into high profile again. Perhaps I didn’t expect it to happen so quickly, but Celtic is one - he has had a number of offers too from other football clubs as well - so he has obviously a lot to consider.’

Keane endured mixed fortunes in charge of Sunderland and Ipswich and Celtic fans have reacted coolly to news of the talks.

He has been out of frontline management since being sacked by Ipswich in January last year.

Insisting the Irish stint - brokered by Desmond and funded by his billionaire business crony Denis O’Brien - has rehabilitated the former midfielder, however, O’Neill said: ‘Roy has been great for me, I’ve genuinely enjoyed working with him, he’s sometimes a totally different character to the one you see in front of the TV camera.

‘He’s been excellent, the players have enjoyed him immensely.

‘I can only say that naturally I’d be disappointed if he left because I really think he’s been terrific.

‘I’ve often said here that he’ll be a manager again himself. I just didn’t expect it that quickly. Again, it was only an informal discussion he was having.

I don’t know the ins and outs of it, I don’t know, I think they do have a list of people they’re speaking to and, you never know, they might speak to someone else

‘I just reiterate he wouldn’t take it lightly. He loves it here, genuinely loves it here. It’s been great for him.’

The statement from Celtic last night made it clear Keane is but one of the candidates they are looking at.

It read: ‘Following speculation concerning the manager’s position at Celtic the club can confirm that it is currently continuing its discussions with a number of excellent candidates.’

But last night Charlie Mulgrew backed Keane to show the right stuff as Celtic manager and said: ‘I’m sure he’d be a good man for the job.

‘As a player I think the club needs a big character and he definitely fits the bill.

‘He’s a strong character and probably the type of guy that would be good for the job.‘Of course, we want a manager as soon as possible because it gets us prepared for the Champions League qualifiers.

‘But I’m sure the club will take its time to get the right man. As long as it’s a big character. I’m sure the club will look into it and find the right man for the job.’

One player who may not be around to see Keane’s potential takeover is goalkeeper Fraser Forster with Tottenham placing him on a list of potential replacements for Hugo Lloris.
