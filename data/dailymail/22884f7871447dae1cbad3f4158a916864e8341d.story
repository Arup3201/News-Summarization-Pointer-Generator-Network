The pimping case against former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn looks to have collapsed, after the prosecutor called for all charges to be dropped. 

'Neither the judicial enquiry nor the hearing' proved Strauss-Kahn was guilty of procuring prostitutes for sex parties he attended in Paris, Brussels and Washington, prosecutor Frederic Fevre said. 

He added DSK's 'notoriety shouldn't be in any way a presumption of guilt' and the decision to acquit was 'pure and simple'.

Cleared: The French prosecutor has said former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn should be cleared of all charges against him

The former shoo-in as the socialist presidential candidate showed little reaction as the statements were made in the courtroom today.

The announcement came after four prostitutes - the main prosecution witnesses in the trial in Lille, northern France, in which the 65-year-old is accused of aggravated pimping - dropped their accusations. 

DSK was accused of aiding and assisting the prostitution of seven women between 2009 and 2011 in what prosecutors were claiming was an organised sex ring using prostitutes.

He and 13 other defendants deny charges of pimping. 

DSK, who took the stand for three days last week, has consistently maintained he had no idea the women participating in sex parties were prostitutes, nor that he organised the parties himself - both of which would have had to have been proved in order to be convicted of pimping.   

DSK had particularly objected to a claim by one woman who said she cried and gestured that she did not want to perform a certain sex act with him, but that he smiled and went ahead anyway.

‘It’s not my concept of sexuality to do it with a prostitute,’ DSK said, adding that he preferred the ‘party atmosphere’ of partner-swapping and swinging. 

DSK said despite the idea given in court papers of ‘frenetic activity’, the orgies were organised four times a year because he had been very busy ‘saving the world from catastrophe’ at the time of the financial crisis.

In court, he also revealed he had had a 'complicated relationship' with his ex-wife, the art heiress Anne Sinclair.

But yesterday, when the prostitutes who had made a series of allegations - including many alleging they had been powerless to stop him subjecting them to painful sex acts performed at orgies around the world - withdrew their complaints, the trial looked like it was on the verge of collapse.

One of the women’s rights group that was supporting them also withdrew their complaint, leaving just one other organisation called Nid still maintaining the allegation. 

Today, the prosecutor asked the judge to acquit DSK - something the judge will have to consider.

Fevre said: 'The 14 accused have already paid a strong price [by having their private lives dragged into the press].

'This is not a mafia network, but a group of egotistical friends, of ambitions and sexual pleasures. 

'They lost everything. I ask the court to take this into its consideration.' 

It is thought it will take a number of weeks to see if he is actually exonerated, according to French website L'Actualitie24. 

If found guilty, he would have faced up to ten years in prison and a fine of more than £1million. 

Despite a number of previous high-profile accusations against him, including being arrested on suspicion of the attempted rape of a hotel chamber maid in New York, the Lille case is the first time that DSK has faced trial.
