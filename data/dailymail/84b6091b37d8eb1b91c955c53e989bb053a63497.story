A new BBC sitcom set on the north Norfolk coast is being filmed 165 miles away in Kent in order to save money.

Boomers is set in a fictional Norfolk resort based on the Victorian seaside resort of Hunstanton.

But instead of filming in the town - filming crews have gone to Kent instead. 

Teams have spent days filming in Herne 
Bay, near Canterbury, and London for the six-episode pilot, which stars
 Russ Abbot, Stephanie Beacham, Philip Jackson, James Smith, Alison 
Steadman, June Whitfield and Paula Wilcox.

Boomers - featuring  Russ Abbot, Stephanie Beacham, Philip Jackson, James Smith, Alison Steadman, June Whitfield and Paula Wilcox - is set in a fictional Norfolk resort based on Hunstanton. But instead of filming in the town - producers have gone to Kent instead

Boomers follows the ups and downs of three couples living in the fictional resort of Thurnemouth, described as being 'Norfolk’s only West-facing resort' - which in reality, is Hunstanton.

Producers Hat Trick said the decision to film in Kent was for budgetary reasons.

'Whilst Boomers is set in the fictional town of Thurnemouth in Norfolk, the seaside scenes were actually shot in Herne Bay in Kent,' a spokeswoman said.

When asked why, she said: 'Simple budgetary reasons I’m afraid.'

Hunstanton Mayor Carol Bower said: 'It’s a real shame that it’s not being filmed in Hunstanton.

'We are massively different to Kent and it would have done wonders for us.'

She added: 'Hopefully the BBC have done their research - it would bug me a little if the show is misleading.

'We are a very proud Victorian style town, so for people here it would be odd if the place looked nothing like Hunstanton.'

Hunstanton is a popular coastal resort 16 miles from King’s Lynn and 12 miles from Sandringham in Norfolk.

It was as a Norfolk seaside resort during Victorian times.

Its west facing position make it a popular choice with visitors who enjoy stunning sunsets over The Wash.

Herne Bay, also a popular seaside town in Victorian times, has retained its traditional seaside charm.

Pebble
 beaches lined with brightly coloured beach huts still prove a hit with 
today's tourists who flock to the Kent coast in summer.

It also enjoys a rich sporting scene among rowers, yachtsmen and jet ski riders.

Keith Skipper founded FOND - Friends of Norfolk Dialect - after characters in the 1999 drama documentary All The King’s Men, set partly at Sandringham, proudly marched off to the First World War with Somerset accents.

He said: 'It’s just the same old story.

'There’s this perpetual business about confusing one part of the country with another.

'I don’t know why they can take such hideous liberties with Norfolk and Suffolk, I don’t know boy.'

Boomers is being screened on BBC1 at 9pm on Friday.
