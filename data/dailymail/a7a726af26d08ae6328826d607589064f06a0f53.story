United States Secret Service is investigating a photograph blasted out on Twitter which seems to show someone holding up a smartphone, displaying a picture of the ISIS flag, in front of the White House.

The photo appears to have been taken at night on the pedestrian mall occupying what used to be part of Pennsylvania Avenue. The White House's north portico can be seen in the background.

It was first tweeted on August 9 by an account that was later deleted.

'[W]e are here #America near our #target :) sooooooooooooon,' read the message that accompanied it.

ISIS taunted the U.S. with a photo taken in front of the White House, showing a smartphone displaying the terror group's flag

Hubris: In a gripping interview captured last month, an ISIS soldier in Syria boasts that his organization will capture America's seat of power

Later that day another pro-ISIS Twitter user whose account is named 'Conquer the tyrants'Â  reposted the photo with a separate warning.

'We are in your state,' it read. ''We are in your cities. We are in your streets. You are our goals anywhere [sic].'

Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan told ABC News that his agency has 'an intelligence division whose mission is to assess information that we receive every day for dangerousness or potential threat level.'

'We are aware of the image and will take the necessary and appropriate follow up steps,' he said.

The taunting message follows a separate photo first seen online on June 30, which appeared to show a hand-written note, in Arabic, dated June 20 and held up in front of the Old Republic Building in Chicago.

'Soldiers of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria will pass from here soon,' the note reads, according to an ABC News translation.

A verse from the Quran follows, reading, '... and Allah is perfecting His light even though the disbelievers hate [that].'

On June 20 another ISIS supporter captured this image in front of the Old Republic BUilding in Chicago -- tweeting it more than a week later along with a threat that 'Soldiers of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria will pass from here soon'

'Near our target': The White House photo was first tweeted by an account that was subsequently shut down

ISIS, the terror group that claims it has established an Islamic caliphate in parts of Syria and Iraq, has used social media as a propaganda tool, and ramped up those efforts after President Barack Obama announced on August 8 that he would approve airstrikes against the group in northern Iraq if they were necessary.

A half-day later, the U.S. struck in what the White House said was an effort to guarantee the safety of American personnel in Iraqi Kurdistan, and to protect tens of thousands of Yadizis, a religious minority group.

An American operations outpost in the Kurdish capital of Erbil, White House officials said then, was close enough to ISIS forces to justify limited military intervention.

The Yazidis had escaped to a mountainside and were languishing without food or water. Obama took a victory lap on Thursday after Special Forces flyovers established that days of U.S. airdrops of supplies had been sufficient to sustain them long enough to escape.

Pushback: Americans are giving as good as they get, with tweeted replies aimed at intimidating the Islamist group

'We are in your cities,' the ISIS tweeter claimed, but this man, apparently a U.S. military veteran, had the perfect retort

ISIS fighters have boasted a fearlessness common in a culture that regards martyrdom as a kind of success and sees America as an enemy almost as fundamental as Israel.

In one interview filmed in Syria by the cameras of VICE News, an unnamed ISIS soldier warns: 'I say to America that the Islamic Caliphate has been established. And we will not stop.'

'Don't be cowards and attack us with drones,' he says. 'Instead send your soldiers, the ones we humiliated in Iraq.'

'We will humiliate them everywhere, God willing, and we will raise the flag of Allah in the White House.'
