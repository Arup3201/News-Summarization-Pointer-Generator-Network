Phillip Lemonheigh turned his car into a fake ambulance by using a flashing blue light and 'emergency response' stickers

A driver who turned his car into a fake ambulance by using a flashing blue light and 'emergency response' stickers was caught after speeding through a red traffic light.

Phillip Lemonheigh disguised his wife's Renault Laguna estate car as an ambulance for three months before he was eventually caught.

Lemonheigh, 59, was seen travelling at 73mph in a 50mph zone in Llantrisant, near Cardiff, as he ran errands for his bed-bound wife Noreen.

He was arrested after being recorded running the light in the 'ambulance' almost 24 seconds after it had turned red.

Despite not having a driving licence, Lemonheigh got behind the blue Renault as he ran errands for his wife who suffers from a 'chronic medical condition'. 

A judge at Swansea Crown Court told Lemonheigh - who arrived at court in a wheelchair - that he had 'never come across something so bizarre' in his entire career. 

The 59-year-old disguised the blue Renault Laguna estate car as a first response-style ambulance and then spent three months speeding in it and running traffic signals, the court heard.

But his deception came to an end when he was caught by a speed camera on the A4119. 

Lemonheigh, who admits dangerous driving, will be sentenced next month because he suffered a heart attack in the days leading up to the hearing.

He also perverting the course of justice after claiming he was a 'volunteer ambulance driver' at the time of the offence.

Judge Peter Heywood said: 'I don't think I have ever come across something so bizarre, these clearly are very unusual offences to which you have pleaded guilty.

'As you know the court will be minded to consider a prison sentence and I will be asking for medical and psychological reports to be made.'

The judge also imposed an 'interim disqualification' to stop Lemonheigh from driving ahead of his sentencing on March 20.

Speaking after the court hearing, a laughing Lemonheigh admitted that he had been driving the fake ambulance for three months before 'going a bit far'.

He said: 'I had the words emergency response stuck on the side, I paid a printer £18 to have them put on, I had the car like that for three months.

'I just went a bit far and they caught me. I don't think I was doing anything wrong. But each to their own.' 

Teresa Healy, operations manager at GoSafe - who are responsible for speed cameras around Wales - said: 'This case should be a lesson to everyone who is considering lying to the police.

'It is disappointing to find that people are still going to great and calculated lengths to avoid prosecution.'
