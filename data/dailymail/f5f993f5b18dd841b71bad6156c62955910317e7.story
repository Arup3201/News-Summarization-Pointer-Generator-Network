Barcelona can’t win anything without kids at the moment. After 18-year-old Munir inspired their opening day win over Elche they made it two wins in two thanks to 19-year-old forward Sandro.

Luis Enrique’s team dominated Villarreal but despite superb displays from Lionel Messi and Dani Alves they owed their 1-0 win to their young Canary Island striker who scored the only goal of the game eight minutes from time.

Last week’s hero Munir was picked to start ahead of Neymar and he had his first chance after five minutes when Alves fed Messi who crossed for the young striker but his shot was smothered by Sergio Asenjo.

Goal: Sandro 82

Messi also went close but was denied by Victor Ruiz as Barcelona made all the early running with both full-backs playing high up the pitch outside of the visitor’s narrow front three – Luis Enrique already with one eye on how the team will play when both Luis Suarez and Neymar are available to start with Messi.

Pedro, the third man in Barca’s attack, had his first chance on 15 minutes but Asenjo again was able to make the save.

Alves was being whistled by a mindless minority of home fans. The last time he was at El Madrigal he was racially abused by a supporter who threw a banana at him and he reacted by peeling the banana and taking a bite. The action gave rise to the ‘somostodosmacacos’ (we are all monkeys) anti-racisim campaign.

The Brazilian was a constant threat but Villarreal were finally finding their feet and had their best chance of the first half on 23 minutes when Giovani Dos Santos crossed from the right. The centre evaded everyone and Ruiz was all alone at the far post onside and with the chance to put Villarreal ahead. He made poor contact with the ball and sent his effort over Claudio Bravo’s bar.

Barcelona almost punished Villarreal immediately when they counter-attacked through Messi and Pedro was played in only to be fouled in the box by Mario. The penalty was not given and the chance was gone.

Messi then hit the post with a free-kick that hit midfielder Manu Trigueros and and was pushed onto the frame of the goal by Asenjo.

Barcelona continued to threaten down their right with Ivan Rakitic releasing Alves and the full-back winning a corner which came to nothing.

Carlos Velasco Carballo was refereeing the game – the Spaniard was in charge of the Brazil v Colombia at the World Cup in which Neymar suffered a fractured vertibrae. He booked Alves five minutes before half-time when the defender complained of a kick from Villarreal’s Jaume Costa.

With Barcelona no closer to breaking the deadlock at the start of the second half coach Luis Enrique made his first change on the hour and it was Neymar, who after a strenuous warm-up that also included signing autographs, replaced Munir.

Barcelona almost scored immediately with Rakitic finding space inside the penalty area but dragging his cross-shot wide.

Still the crosses rained in from Alves’ right wing but there was no-one to convert them and Messi was getting increasingly frustrated. He went close with a free-kick that Asenjo pushed out for a corner and from the resulting kick the Argentine headed well wide.

Barcelona then had their best chance so far. Messi crossed from the right and the ball dropped to Neymar almost on the goal line. The Brazilian only had to lift it over Ruiz who had gone to ground but instead he blasted against the defenders legs and watched it cannon away to safety.

Nyemar’s next chance was much more difficult but again it was one you would expect him to score. This time he leaned back and lifted his effort over Asenjo’s bar. Down at the other end Tomas Pina hit the post as Barcelona were almost made to pay the ultimate price for their poor finishing. It was the cue for coach Luis Enrique to turn to Xavi who replaced Rafinha. 

Barcelona’s favourite route to goal did not change and neither did the result – yet another Alves cross reached Messi and this time his first time shot came back off the outside of the post.

Barcelona were enjoying 75 per cent of possession but were still missing the finish until minute 82 when substitute Sandro Ramirez who had replaced Pedro midway through the second half turned the ball in from a yard out – from almost the same place Neymar had missed his earlier sitter.

Neymar it was who played in Messi he tricked his way to the byline and when keeper Asenjo was unable to block his cross it reached the young B-team forward who made no mistake.
