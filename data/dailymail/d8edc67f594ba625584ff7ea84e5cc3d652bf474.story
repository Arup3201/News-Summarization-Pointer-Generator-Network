As beef from the West disappears from Russian supermarkets, the Kremlin is urging people to eat Siberian reindeer instead.

Schools and hospitals in Chukota - a far-flung region close to Alaska where football tycoon Roman Abramovich was once governor - are to be supplied from local herds to replace American imports.

The move comes as a McDonald's outlet in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, and a Burger King in Krasnoyarsk, are the latest to be targeted by the Russian authorities in what is seen as punishment for Western sanctions.

The chains are being hid by inspections over alleged administrative or sanitary abuses, a move widely seen as having political connotations.

The Russian government has targeted Western food imports in a tit-for-tat move for sanctions imposed over the Ukraine crisis.

This has led to an embargo on meat from the US and EU.As Scottish and American beef vanish from the shelves, TV news reports in Russia are instead strongly promoting the delights of reindeer delicacies from producers across Siberia.

'Reindeer meat is ecologically clean, and that is why neither French foie gras, nor Spanish jambon not any other foreign delicacies can compare with it,' said a Russian TV report trumpeting the benefits of home-grown produce.

In the Yamal region of northern Russia, some 70,000 reindeer will be slaughtered this year for venison, reported The Siberian Times 

Supplies are now to be switched to central Russia.
