A  Ukip candidate who posted a map on his Facebook page which calls Africa 'Bongo Bongo Land' has been banned from speaking at a secondary school following protests by parents.

David Little, parliamentary candidate for Dover and Deal in Kent, caused outrage last month after he posted a spoof 'Ukip map of the world' on his social media account.

Mr Little, a father-of-two, has now said 'mob rule' has prevailed after Castle Community College in Deal and Walmer withdrew its invitation to him to give a lecture about the importance of democracy.

A Ukip candidate was banned from giving a school talk after posting this spoof on Facebook. It was meant to lampoon Ukip's perceived prejudices with deliberately offensive jibes at 'poofters' and 'Bongo Bongo land'

Outcast: David Little has now been banned from speaking at a local school after parents protested

The U-turn came after parents threatened to picket the school in protest.

The Ukip Map of the World was a spoof drawn for the politicalbetting.com website by cartoonist Martha Richler, known as Marf.

Lampooning Ukip's perceived prejudices, it also refers to French people as cheese-eating, beret-wearing frogs and people in London as 'cosmopolitan poofters' - foreshadowing the use of the homophobic word this week by Ukip candidate Kerry Smith.

At the time Mr Little told the Mirror: 'I love Marf's cartoons and I thought it was a brilliant bit of satire lampooning UKIP. 

'It's clearly a joke at UKIP's expense. I think it's really important to laugh at yourself now and again.'

Mr Little, who hopes to stand for the Dover constituency at next May's election, was due to speak at the school on Thursday.

He said: 'What do they think I'm going to do? Set fire to their kids?'

'I'm quite upset - and that's being politically correct. This Thursday I'd been invited to go along and speak to the students at Castle Community.

'Then I got a phone call yesterday saying that some parents had objected. If I turned up they were going to picket the school.

'We are a legitimate political party. We've got members of Parliament, members of European Parliament, we've got councillors across the UK.

'This is an affront to democracy. How can we speak to children about democracy, about the rule of law if I can't speak to them? 

Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said it is important all views are listened to to ensure people have choice

'And they haven't determined how many have complained. Is it one? Three? Three hundred?'

'Mob rule has won.'  

Mr Little, who owns a printing company, said it was not the first time his membership of Ukip had landed him in hot water.

Last month football fans threatened to boycott a Dover Athletic match after he attempted to sponsor it under the Ukip banner.

The details were eventually  changed to read 'David Little and Friends'.

Charlie Elphicke, Tory MP for Deal and Dover, said of the parents' protest: 'It's really important to remember the values of our White Cliffs: On one hand there's free speech. 

'They stand as a hallowed ground as a warning against extremism and hate.

'I think its very important that all views are listened to. It's important that people see there is a choice: Extremism and hate from Ukip and hope and the future from us.'

But the cartoonist - despite drawing her work because she strongly disagrees with Ukip - said it was wrong of the school to censor Mr Little.

Martha Richler told MailOnline: 'I thought it was to his credit that he could laugh at himself.

'I think in a way it's best for all of us to hear what people are thinking. The moment we start censoring each other it makes it much trickier and drives it all underground.

'Although I hate to hear it, I think it's best for all of us to know what people are really thinking.'

The school has not yet responded to a request for a comment.

Last month MailOnline reported that Ukip member Mike Ward claimed he was asked to step down from his role as Head of Governors at Eskdale School in Whitby, North Yorkshire after he became a member of Ukip. 

The Scarborough councillor, 70, who had previously stood as an independent, said he was invited to a meeting with headteacher Sue Whelan after his political switch was reported in local media. 

He said: 'She then asked me to resign saying Ukip’s policies were against the ethos of the school.'
