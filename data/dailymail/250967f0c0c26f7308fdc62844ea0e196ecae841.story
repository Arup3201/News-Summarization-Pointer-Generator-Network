On trial: A Muslim woman has been told she will have to lift her veil if she wants to give evidence while on trial for witness intimidation

A woman made legal history yesterday as she stood trial in a full face veil.

Rebekah Dawson, 22, became the first defendant to wear the covering at court after a judge ruled ‘freedom of religious expression’ should be recognised.

District Judge Peter Murphy told jurors that Dawson had a right to wear a niqab during the trial but that she would have to remove it if she wanted to give evidence.

He ruled: ‘The courts must respect and protect religious rights as far as that can possibly be done.

‘But in my view, it is necessary to the working of the crown court in a democratic society for the court, not the defendant to control the conduct of judicial proceedings.’

At Blackfriars Crown Court yesterday, Dawson argued that forcing her to remove the veil to give evidence violated her right to a fair trial under the European Convention on Human Rights.

But Judge Murphy rejected the application, saying that jurors being unable to see her was contrary to the principle of open justice which overrides religious belief.

He invited the defendant to remove the garment, but after a brief adjournment Dawson returned to court still wearing her niqab.

Judge Murphy told jurors: ‘I am aware 
some people have certain feelings about it [the niqab], but if you have 
any feelings you must put them aside completely...  She is perfectly 
entitled in this country to dress as she wishes.’

He
 added: ‘The courts have for many years, indeed centuries, ruled that 
when a jury have been asked to evaluate evidence a witness gives it is 
important for jurors to see them … It is not possible to do that if they
 cannot see the witness’ face.’

Dawson,
 and her brother Matthias, 32, are accused of threatening a caretaker at
 Finsbury Park Mosque, north London, after he let three female charity 
workers from Portugal – who were not wearing veils – enter the building 
on June 4 last year.

Dawson,
 of Hackney, east London, and her brother Matthias Dawson, of Sydenham, 
south-east London, deny a single charge of witness intimidation.

The trial continues.
