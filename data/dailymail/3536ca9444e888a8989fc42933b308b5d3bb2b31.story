The deaf twins killed by euthanasia in Belgium chose to die because they 'had nothing to live for' after learning they would soon become blind, their brother revealed today.

The 45-year-olds, named yesterday as Marc and Eddy Verbessem, had lived together their entire adult lives and could not communicate with the outside world.

Their brother, Dirk Verbessem, said they were terrified of never being able to see each other and feared losing their independence in an institution.

'That was for my brothers unbearable,' said Mr Verbessem, 46.

'Did not want to end up in an institution: Deaf Belgian twins Marc and Eddy Verbessem chose to die by euthanasia because they feared losing their independence after learning they would also soon go blind

'They lived together, did their own cooking and cleaning. You could eat off the floor. Blindness would have made them completely dependent.

'I sometimes think, if they had their wives and children, perhaps they would have had something to live for.'

The twins, from the village of Putte, near the city of Mechelen, were told they would go blind from a genetically caused form of glaucoma and had other severe medical problems, their local doctor, David Dufour.

The pair, who both worked as cobblers and could communicate with each other using a special sign language understood only by them and their close family, enlisted the support of Mr Dufour to be euthanised.

But it took them almost two years to find a medical institution to carry out the procedure after they were turned by their local hospital.

Mr Verbessem told the Daily Telegraph that the family had tried to talk them out of it, but were eventually persuaded by their arguments.

They died by lethal injection four 
weeks ago, dressed in new shoes and suits, with Mr Verbessem and their 
parents, Mary and Remy, by their sides at Brussels University Hospital 
in Jette.

Mr Verbessem said: 'Marc and Eddy waved again at us. "Up in the sky," they said. "Up in the sky," we replied. And then it was over.'

Euthanasia is legal under Belgian law 
if those making the decision can make their wishes clear and are 
suffering unbearable pain, according to a doctor's judgement.

The Belgian law differs from that of 
Switzerland, famous for its Dignitas clinic, where only 'assisted 
suicide' is permitted. This means patients must play an active role in 
the administration of the drug that ends their lives.

Brussels University Hospital: In Belgium, some 
1,133 cases of euthanasia - mostly for terminal cancer - were recorded 
in 2011, about one per cent of all deaths in the country, according to 
official figures

In Belgium, some 1,133 cases of 
euthanasia - mostly for terminal cancer - were recorded in 2011, about 
one percent of all deaths in the country, according to official figures.

But this case was unusual as neither twin was suffering extreme physical pain or was terminally ill.

Mr Dufour, the doctor who presided 
over the euthanasia, told RTL television news that the twins had taken the 
decision in 'full conscience'.

He said they were 'very happy' and it had was a 'relief' to see the end of their suffering.

'They had a cup of coffee in the hall, it went well and a rich conversation,' Mr Dufour said.

More to come? Belgium's ruling Socialists tabled a legal 
amendment just days after the twins were killed which would allow the 
euthanasia of children and Alzheimer's sufferers (picture posed by

'Then the separation from their parents 
and brother was very serene and beautiful. At the last there was a 
little wave of their hands and then they were gone.'

Belgium was the second country in the 
world after the Netherlands to legalise euthanasia in 2002, but it 
currently applies only to people over the age of 18.

Other jurisdictions where it is permitted include Luxembourg and the U.S. state of Oregon.

Just days after the twins were killed, 
Belgium's ruling Socialists tabled a legal amendment which would allow 
the euthanasia of children and Alzheimer's sufferers.

The draft legislation calls for 'the 
law to be extended to minors if they are capable of discernment or 
affected by an incurable illness or suffering that we cannot alleviate.'

The Dignitas building in Pfaeffikon near Zurich: Under Swiss law only 'assisted suicide' is permitted - which means that patients must take an active role in administering the drug that ends their lives

The proposed changes are likely to be 
approved by other parties, although no date has yet been put forward for
 a parliamentary debate.

A bid to tighten legal controls on 
assisted deaths in Switzerland and ban suicide tourism was recently 
rejected by the country's parliament.

Experts say the suicide tourism industry's clients come mainly from Britain, Germany, and France, but that numbers have been declining in recent years.

Statistics from Dignitas show the 
clinic based near Zurich has helped a total of 1,298 people commit 
suicide between 1998 and 2011.
