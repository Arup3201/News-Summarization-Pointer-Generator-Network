There are plants growing out of cracks in the brickwork, the window frames are covered in dirt and the scaffolding forces wheelchair users off the pavement and into oncoming traffic.

But this dilapidated building has not fallen into disrepair because of cowboy builders or an unscrupulous landlord.

It is owned by a government minister – and the locals are furious.

Neighbours say the scaffolding in Havant, Hampshire has been up for two years and forces traffic to slow down

They say David Willetts has allowed the 17th-century property to become a crumbling ‘eyesore’ that is blighting their town.

At the building in Havant, Hampshire, 
where the 56-year-old Tory MP also has his constituency home, the 
scaffolding alone has been there for two years.

Tim Dawes, from the Havant Civic 
Society, said: ‘I think it is beholden to David Willetts, who likes to 
demonstrate that he has the interests of the town at heart, to do 
something about it.

David Willetts, the Universities Minister, said he was going back to the drawing board over what to do about his dilapidated property

‘It’s in a conservation area so it’s 
covered by certain requirements. David Willetts is a man of civic 
responsibility and a man of reasonable personal resources.

‘I don’t think it’s unreasonable to 
ask him to try to do something about it. It’s been in a state of 
dilapidation for some time.’

The higher education minister, 
nicknamed ‘Two Brains’ for his reputation as an intellectual, bought the
three-bedroom building with his wife Sarah Butterfield in 2008 for 
£220,000.

Miss Butterfield is a professional 
artist who graduated from the Ruskin School of Fine Art in Oxford. Her 
distinctive figurative paintings have been exhibited all over the world.

The couple, who have two children, had
hoped to convert the property into two, two-bedroom houses, and 
permission was granted by Havant council the same year.

But as work was about to begin, surveyors found the property was structurally unsafe and would have to be pulled down.

The scaffolding means that wheelchair 
users, mothers with pushchairs and pensioners on mobility scooters are 
constantly forced off the pavement and into oncoming traffic to get 
past. The door and window frames are covered in dirt.

Residents say Mr Willetts has taken too long to solve the problem.

Ivy Harbey, 89, said: ‘The building 
has been like that for years now. It’s not very nice at all and it’s 
about time someone did something about it. It could be a lovely house 
but it’s falling apart.

‘The scaffolding is a real nuisance 
too because it takes up the pavement. I use a scooter to get into town 
because I can’t walk and it’s sometimes difficult to get around the 
scaffolding.’

David Willetts MP at his home in Havant. He said he plans to knock the building down and replace it

Another neighbour, retired bank worker
Colin Hazzard, added: ‘It’s a bit of a shame that a beautiful, historic
building like that has fallen into such a state. It’s an eyesore.

‘There’s a plant growing out of the wall – any more and it will look like a garden centre.’

The 66-year-old added: ‘The scaffolding is a pain for people with wheelchairs and buggies.’

Mr Willetts admitted he had left 
residents frustrated but said: ‘We’ve gone back to the drawing board and
put forward a new proposal to knock down and replace it with something 
as similar as possible, a new building using the old bricks.

‘The council had some queries about 
our original application and we’re about to submit a revised application
which we hope they will be satisfied with.

‘It’s taken a long time. I understand 
people’s frustrations but I have explained what the problem was and 
we’re going to submit a revised application very soon.’
