Investigators suspect that a snapped clip sent eight aerial acrobats plummeting 20 feet or more during a daring act in which performers dangle from their hair.

One injured performer told her father she didn't notice anything amiss before her 'plunge into darkness.'

While another looked up calmly at police Sgt. Sean Carroll as she lay motionless on the floor and told him: 'I can't feel my legs.'

Performance gone wrong: An injured female performer is lifted onto a stretcher after the platform collapsed during an aerial hair-hanging stunt at the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus in Providence in May

Eight performers remained hospitalized Monday after a platform collapsed during a performance by the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in Providence, Rhode Island on Sunday

After the accident, a 4- to 5-inch steel clip or carabiner was found in three pieces on the ground with its spine snapped.

Providence
 Public Safety Commissioner Steven Pare stopped short of saying the 
carabiner caused Sunday's accident at the Ringling Bros. and Barnum and 
Bailey circus, witnessed by about 3,900 people, many of them children. 
The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration is trying to 
make a final determination.

'We don't know if it was metal fatigue, if it wasn't properly positioned or something else,' Pare said. 'We just don't know.'

All eight of the acrobats were still hospitalized with injuries including a pierced liver and neck and back fractures, as well as head injuries.

None of the injuries appear to be life-threatening, said Stephen Payne, a spokesman for Feld Entertainment, Ringling's parent company.

The last two acrobats in critical condition were upgraded to serious condition Monday night. Four of the acrobats were in good condition and four in serious.

Providence Public Safety Commissioner
 Steven Pare said investigators know that at least one clamp - D-ring 
carabiner - attaching the human chandelier to the rafters at the Dunkin'
 Donuts Center failed.

It is unclear why it broke or if other parts of the complex rigging system malfunctioned.

Eleven people were admitted to hospital on Sunday after the platform collapsed during an aerial hair-hanging stunt,
 sending eight acrobats plummeting to the ground.

Pare said two of the acrobats are still in critical condition; three are in serious condition and three are stable.

Two of them had 
surgery, including Widny Neves, 25, who suffered a badly broken arm. Her
 father Roiter told NBC News that it is a miracle that no one died.

‘The first thing in my mind is nobody 
can survive. It's too high and too heavy, too many girls. But no one is 
dead from this accident,’ he told NBC News.

In addition to a broken arm, his daughter suffered minor fractures to her back and neck and will need months of physical therapy to recover.

The women are from the United States, Brazil, Bulgaria and Ukraine, the circus said. A dancer on the ground was also injured and was released from the hospital Sunday.

Roiter had no doubt she would return to big top and its most daring acts.

'All circus acts are dangerous jobs,' he said. 'If you work in that field, you accept the risk.'

The rigging for the show was designed by the troupe's founder, Andre Medeiros, whose wife Viktoriya was in the air and is among the injured.

The seriously injured 
suffered broken bones and internal bleeding, while several other staff suffered minor 
injuries. No audience members were hurt.

'All performers have received medial treatment and are resting comfortably, we are pleased though their injuries are serious none appear to be life threatening,' said Stephen Payne, a spokesman for Feld Entertainment, the parent company of Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.

Payne also told Today
 that there was still a possibility that a performance scheduled for 
Monday evening may go ahead without the aerial element of the show.

The
 accident was reported to police at about 11:45 a.m., 45 minutes into 
the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus' Legends show at the 
Dunkin' Donuts Center.

He
 said the metal-frame apparatus from which the performers were hanging 
came free from the metal truss it was connected to. The eight women fell
 25 to 40 feet, landing on a dancer on the ground.

Rhode Island Hospital in Providence admitted 11 patients with varying injuries. Three of the victims were ground personnel.

It was witnessed by an audience of about 3,900, many of them children.

All
 the performers have been doing ‘some variation of this act for some 
time,’ Payne said, though he didn't know how long. The current 
incarnation of the act began in January with the launch of the show, he 
said.

Providence
 Public Safety Commissioner Steven Pare said officials and inspectors 
haven't yet determined what caused the accident.

Sydney
 Bragg, 14, of North Kingstown, said the platform began to fall as it 
neared the rafters of the arena. At first, she said, she thought it was 
part of the act.

‘It
 just went crashing down,’ Sydney said. ‘Everyone was freaking out. We 
heard this huge clatter and then we just heard the girls scream.’

She said spotlights were on the performers at the time, but all the lights went out after the fall.

Rosa
 Viveiros of Seekonk, Massachusetts, said the act was covered by a 
curtain.

Shortly after the curtain was pulled away, she said, the 
performers fell on top of at least one other performer, a man who stood 
up with his face bloodied. The other performers remained still, she 
said.

‘We thought it was part of the circus,’ said Rosa Viveiros' husband, Joe.

'Everybody’s conscious. Everybody’s doing well. We ask 
everybody to pray for the girls,' said Roman Garcia, general manager of the touring circus, at a news conference.

Othello Smith of Providence said he took his young children out of the auditorium shortly after the accident.

‘One of the performers was crying,’ he told the Providence Journal. ‘It looked pretty bad.’

‘They just dropped,’ he said. ‘It happened so fast you didn’t really believe it happened.’

The circus had arrived in town on Friday and performances were scheduled through Monday, before it moves on to Hartford, CT.

Another witness reported seeing a 
performer being lifted onto a gurney and as they were being wheeled 
towards the rescue truck, they waved to the audience and members of the 
audience clapped.

The incident occurred during a part of the show at the Dunkin Donuts Center which featured a team of acrobats

Fire department rescue units from Providence, East Providence, and Smithfield were called to assisted with the injured. The circus performances were suspended after the accident and quickly canceled.

Officials later announced that the scheduled 3 p.m. and 7 p.m.
performances have been canceled.

A circus announcer told the audience that accidents can happen in live performances and thanked the first responders for there efforts.

The hair-hanging stunt is described on the circus' website as a ‘larger-than-life act’ featuring eight female performers.

‘These “hairialists” perform a combination of choreography and cut-ups including spinning, hanging from hoops, and rolling down wrapped silks, all while being suspended 35 feet in the air by their hair alone,’ the website says.

‘In this hair-raising act, audiences will even see the weight of three girls held aloft by the locks of only one of these tangled beauties.’
