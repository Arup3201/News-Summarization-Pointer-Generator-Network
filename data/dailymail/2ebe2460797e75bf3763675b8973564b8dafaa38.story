Britain faces another 10 years of austerity as the government struggles to repair the country’s battered finances, a hard-hitting report warns today.

The vast deficit racked up by Labour will not be eliminated until after 2020 and possibly not until 2023, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research.

The report also warns that Britain will be stripped of its coveted AAA credit rating as the national debt spirals further out of control.

But it adds that the UK will avoid a triple-dip recession this year - but only just.

The think tank expects a 0.5 per cent slump in output in the final quarter of 2012 followed by growth of just 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2013.

The forecasts will make grim reading for David Cameron and George Osborne and raise the prospect of the next two general elections, in 2015 and 2020, being fought against a backdrop of austerity.

The Chancellor has staked his political and economic credibility on clearing up the mess left by Labour and safe-guarding the country’s gold-plated credit score.

But Scott Corfe, senior economist at the CEBR, said: ‘Weak economic growth will hold back the deficit reduction programme over the coming years.

‘The deficit reduction programme will stretch into not just the next Parliament but into the one after that. It could take another 10 years from now.’

Douglas McWilliams, CEBR chief executive, said: ‘It will be almost impossible for the UK to maintain its AAA rating in the light of this forecast.’

The last Labour government borrowed a record £159 billion in 2009-10 as the financial crisis struck and the economic boom gave way to the biggest bust in living memory.

After coming to power in May 2010, Mr Osborne pledged to eradicate the budget deficit within five years - far faster than planned by Labour.

Borrowing fell to £142 billion in the Coalition’s first year in power and again to £121 billion last year but the decline has not been as fast as the Chancellor predicted.

He has now extended austerity to 2018 as he struggles to balance the books - but the CEBR report warns that this is still too optimistic.

It forecasts borrowing of £68 billion in 2017-18 - more than double the £31 billion expected by the Treasury - making deficit reduction ‘a three Parliament problem’.

The report blames weak growth and the government’s failure to cut spending, which looks set to have risen by 2.8 per cent in 2012, the fastest pace of growth since 2004.

‘There seems to have been a setback in reducing public spending despite alleged austerity,’ said Mr Corfe.

The failure to reduce borrowing more quickly means the national debt will hit almost 85 per cent of national income in the next five years and will not start falling until 2018-19, according to the report.

Mr Osborne initially planned for the national debt to peak at 70.3 per cent of national income in 2013-14 but now hopes it will not rise any higher than 79.9 per cent in 2015-16.

The national debt was just £200 billion 20 years ago and around £300 billion 10 years ago.

But it spiralled to £800 billion under Labour and is set to hit more than £1.5 trillion in the next five years - or £60,000 per household in Britain.

Ruth Lea, economic advisor to the Arbuthnot Banking Group, said: ‘The public finances are truly dire. Public sector net debt is continuing to increase at an alarming rate. Britain’s AAA rating must be regarded as vulnerable.’

Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and Fitch - the world’s three biggest agencies - have all put the AAA rating on ‘negative outlook’ with a downgrade widely expected this year.

Ross Walker, an economist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said: ‘I would be surprised if all three of the main ratings agencies had the UK as AAA by this time next year.’
