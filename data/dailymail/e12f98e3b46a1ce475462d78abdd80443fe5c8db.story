Set for stardom: Madeleine Harris was picked from hundreds of hopefuls for a part in Paddington

A British schoolgirl is set for stardom after being plucked from obscurity to play a lead role in the new Paddington film.

Madeleine Harris, 13, of Shepton Mallet, Somerset, was picked from hundreds to play Judy Brown, the daughter of the family who take in the loveable Peruvian bear.

The film, based on the Paddington Bear books by Michael Bond, stars big names such as Nicole Kidman, Hugh Bonneville, Julie Walters, Jim Broadbent and Peter Capaldi.

It is Madeleine's movie debut and she had to endure a series of interviews and callbacks before she was given the part.

The schoolgirl rubbed shoulders with the stars at the London premier but is now back in classes while the film launches around the world.

Madeleine was initially rejected for looking too young but was offered the role a few months later.

She said: 'The first thought I had was "I've grown!" Because I've always been really small.

'I was really shocked, it still has not really dawned on me I'm in the film. I'm only just starting to realise.

'I couldn't really give you my favourite part of filming because I loved it all so much, but filming late at night in the Natural History Museum was great.

'It was really quite eerie, you would go into rooms and it would be all dark and you would just see bones and hear the music still playing, it was really creepy but so much fun.'

Madeleine, who studies at Shepton Mallet's Whitstone School, managed to complete the filming without missing out on her school work.

'It was actually really easy to balance school and filming,' she added

'All the teachers at Whitstone are fab and would tell me what I'd missed and set work.

'They've give it to me when I could handle it so I could go away and not worry about it at all.

'I had tutoring on set as well so that made it quite easy to catch up.

'The school were just so good and made it so, so easy for me to manage everything.'

Ian Law, a history teacher at Whitstone School, added: 'She is absolutely brilliant, she takes it all in her stride.

'She was in all last week, despite the film premiering, and has been doing really well in her lessons.

'She is so laid back about it all and really hasn't let it get to her head, she's a real credit.'

Madeline kick started her acting career after meeting Idris Elba in London, where she was living while her parents ran a pub.

The schoolgirl told the star of Luther and The Wire about her passion for acting and he arranged a meeting with his agent where she was immediately signed up.

Although this is Madeleine's first role on the big screen the teen is no stranger to acting roles.

Her first acting job was a part in BBC drama Casualty where she played Izzy Forrester, who caused a car crash.

'It was great fun,' she said, 'and still one of the funnest jobs I've done. On my first day I was running across a motorway with cars driving past.'

She has since appeared in television programmes including Mr and Mrs Jones, Man Down, and BBC drama the White Queen.

Madeleine said her friends at school had been 'great' about her acting.

'They're really funny,' she said. 'I have some of the older people in the school come up to me as a joke asking me to sign things.

'It's really funny and a great laugh, everyone's so great about it. It's not a big deal really, we don't tend to talk about it much.'

She added her advice for anyone wanting to be an actor is 'anything is possible'.

'Don't give up. If you carry on wanting it then you can achieve it,' she said.

Paddington opened in cinemas last Friday.
