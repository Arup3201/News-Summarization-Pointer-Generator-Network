Lewis Hamilton has continued to enjoy his time off from Formula One testing as he posted yet another selfie on Instagram - this time with supermodel Naomi Campbell.

The reigning F1 champion has spent the last week or so in America, in that time partying with the likes of Kanye West and Jay Z, as well as attending the NBA all-star game on Sunday night.

The 30-year-old previously took part in a four-day testing period in Jerez from February 1, before flying back to London for a short stint.

Hamilton then made his way to America, attending a host of illustrious events in the past week, including the 57th Grammy Awards last weekend.

On Tuesday he posted a photo of him and Campbell on the social networking site with the message titled: 'Selfie with my big sis @iamnaomicampbell.'

The F1 star has been pictured on a number of occasions during the last week with Campbell - with the latest during New York Fashion Week. 

Hamilton returns to the track in March when the new F1 season begins in Melbourne.
