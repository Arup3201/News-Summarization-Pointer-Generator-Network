Miracle: Holly Keogh is enjoying life at nursery after a heart transplant

Two young girls were making new friends at nursery this week after spending months in hospital strapped to a life-saving artificial heart.

Holly Keogh and Ellie Beale spent every hour of every day attached to the Berlin Heart at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Their world was restricted by the 8ft of tubes and wires connecting them to the miracle machine.

The youngsters' own hearts had failed and Ellie and Holly spent five and six months respectively rigged up to the contraption.

It kept them alive by pumping blood around their body, while they waited for suitable donor organs to be found.

The three-year-olds showed incredible determination to survive, with the risk of infection, blood clots or a fall ever present.

Their frightened parents spent up to 16 heart-wrenching hours a day by their side.

Ellie's dad Simon said: 'We were living from moment to moment. The journey begins, but you don't know when it is going to end.'

Holly's mum Lisa, who left her other two children with their dad Alan and grandparents at home in Dublin to be with her daughter.

She told The Times: 'As a parent you try to give them a little bit of life, find ways to distracted her.

'You have to be strong, you have to be there for your children. It is only when you come home that you realise what you have been through.'

Holly and Ellie, from the Reading area, arrived in cardiac intensive care in end-stage heart failure and were diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy - a condition which did irreversible damage to their hearts and was thought to have been caused by a virus.

If they were struck down a few years earlier, the girls may not have survived, but advances in cardiothroaic care means doctors are able to stablise patients while they search for a positive organ match.

Holly and Ellie were up against a decline in donor numbers, with 167 adults and children on the waiting list compared to 124 a year ago and many parents reluctant to give up their child's organs after they die.

The girls' parents allowed a TV crew to film them in hospital in the hope of encouraging more donors. The BBC Two documentary is on Tuesday at 9pm.

Even with a donor match, Holly and Ellie would not have survived long enough for a transplant if it was not for the Berlin Heart, which is the size of a small fridge and named after the German city where it is made.

The machine moves air in and out of a pumping chamber and pushes blood back into the heart and around the body. A cannula is needed to be inserted into the patient's heart during an operation lasting up to eight hours.

Lisa said: 'It took Holly 12 days to realise she was no longer attached to a machine after her transplant. She stepped outside the room and said mam, I'm outside on my own, what do I do?

'Just keep walking, I said. And she walked so proudly down to the nurses' station with her head held high and said, look at me I have no Berlin Heart! I can walk on my own.

'We will always be extremely grateful to the staff who helped us through the hardest time of our lives, but we will also be extremely grateful to the family of the donor who made that decision to donate their child's organs.'

But despite its life-saving potential, one in four children die waiting for a transplant.

Ellie suffered multiple infections and needed four chambers replaced due to clotting, one of which went undetected and caused a stroke.

Children on a Berlin Heart are given priority on the organ waiting list, with doctors able to transplant a heart up to three times the recipient's body weigh - meaning youngsters can benefit from an adult's heart.

In January, three-month-old Daniela Soto in Dallas became the youngest person ever to be treated with a Berlin Heart.

In December 2010, two-year-old Joe Skerratt was attached to a Berlin Heart at Great Ormond Street Hospital.

He was kept alive by the artificial organ for 251 days - more than any other child in the UK - before under going a successful heart transplant last year.
