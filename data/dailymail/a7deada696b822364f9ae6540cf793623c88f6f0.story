While regular customers have noticed signs on the windows of several stores, confirming the last remaining cafe Hell's Kitchen Pie Face is still available for service.

'Pie Face thanks you for your patronage. Please visit our site on the corner of 36th and 9th Avenue,' the note reads.

Pie Face has not commented since the time of the publication.

Founders Betty Fong and Wayne Homschek opened their first U.S store in New York, on the corner of West 53rd Street and Broadway, next to the iconic David Letterman theatre on Australia Day, January 26 in 2012, which operated 24 hours, seven days a week.

Pie Face revealed in a statement after the opening of its first store in the states, saying: 'The response from New Yorkers has been overwhelming with store sales almost double what an average store sells in Australia.'

The Australian bakery opened up six more locations across the city, with the most recent stores launching in Chelsea and Union Square. 

Pie Face CEO Mr Homschek said on the official page: 'The strength of economics and convenience of the small format bakery café is a key driver of Pie Face’s growth.'

'Our business is not about growth, for growth’s sake. Its about critical mass from a brand, distribution and manufacturing perspective, quality of execution, and quality of product,' he said.

'Our team and franchise partners are passionate about the business, and you can see that right through the business — especially the customer.'

An employee at YC Media, who wished to remain anonymous, told DNAinfo New York that the public relations firm used to represent the chain in the states.

'They didn’t replace us with anyone,' she told DNAinfo New York.

'They stopped having a U.S. rep.'
