She may have quit competitive riding, but mother-to-be Zara Phillips isn’t afraid of getting her hands dirty.

The Queen’s grand-daughter, who is around four months pregnant, spent the day chasing after her horses and even lifting several heavy show-jumping poles at an event on Monday.

The 31-year-old royal, a professional three-day eventer with an Olympic silver medal under her belt, had initially insisted she would continue to compete well into her pregnancy when Buckingham Palace announced that she was expecting her first baby with husband Mike Tindall early next year.

All smiles: The 31-year-old had no problem lifting fences during the practice session

Safety first: Zara has confirmed she will not take part in any competitive riding events for the rest of her pregnancy

Her decision sparked intense debate as the NHS strongly advises pregnant women not to ride in case they either fall off or get kicked by their horse. There is also a danger of placental rupture, caused by the animal’s jolting.

Days later, however, the Mail revealed that Zara had changed her mind and cancelled all her planned rides.

A spokesman for Princess Anne’s daughter stressed there was nothing medically wrong and that her pregnancy was proceeding ‘happily and healthily’.

But she conceded that the royal’s condition had weighed heavily on her decision to quit, almost a year after she won silver at the London Olympics as part of the British three-day eventing team.

‘The fact is that all of Zara’s horses have now qualified for the events she wishes to enter them for next year. She has done so well already this season, she does not actually need to compete any more. Given that she is pregnant, she has decided to cancel the rest of her entries for the year,’ they said.

Friends have stressed however, that Zara will continue to ride privately as her horses need to be exercised.

‘It’s business as usual at the yard as far as she is concerned and Zara will continue to ride. She also plans to be back in the saddle as soon as possible after having her baby; she is a professional sportswoman after all,’ they said.

And on Monday she was more than happy to help out as her protégée, Aimee Aspinall, competed on her two of her horses at the Smiths Lawn Horse Trials in Windsor Great Park.

Zara is apparently keen for her two new mounts, Hanua and Disarm, to continue their training and is taking a hands-on approach to their training.

Dressed in jeans, brown work boots and branded gilet which disguised her growing baby bump, the 15th in line to the throne helped to prepare the horses and was even seen lifting a number of hefty show jumping poles back into position.

Show-jumping is one of the three disciplines that make up three-day eventing, the other two being cross-country and dressage.

An onlooker said: ‘She was out there getting her hands dirty for a good seven or eight hours in some atrocious conditions. You really wouldn’t have thought she was pregnant. Say what you like about the royals, but Zara is clearly no snob.

‘She definitely isn’t the type to sit around drinking tea.’

It is understood that Zara plans to keep involved in this way throughout her pregnancy and intends to be back in the saddle as soon as possible after giving birth, with a view to training for the 2016 Brazil Olympics team.

Zara is only too aware of the dangers of eventing, though, having broken her collar bone when she came off her horse Tsunami II in France in 2008. The horse broke its neck and was killed in the fall.

Her close friend and world-class rider Sherelle Duke, died while competing in 2006 and a week later Zara dedicated her victory at the World Equestrian Games to her.

But riders such as Britain’s Mary King, who won six team golds at the world eventing championships, competed until she was five and a half months pregnant.
