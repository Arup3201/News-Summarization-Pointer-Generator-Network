The number of wild animals, fish and birds in the world has plummeted by almost a third in 40 years because of man’s plundering of natural resources, conservationists have warned.

The tracking of the fate of more than 2,500 species of mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish reveals a planet in peril.

Those in crisis range from tigers – whose numbers are at an all-time low – to river dolphins, some which may already have been driven out of existence.

The World Wildlife Fund claims that the Earth’s capacity for supporting life is being outstripped at such a rate that we will need the equivalent of a second planet to meet our needs by 2030.

By 2050, close to three planets would be needed to maintain man’s current standard of living.

The stark picture is painted by the WWF in its two-yearly survey of the Earth’s health.

Working with London Zoo, it has calculated the world’s wildlife population fell by 30 per cent between 1970 and 2008 – the latest year for which data is available.

Declines are even more dramatic in some regions, with numbers of tropical species falling by 60 per cent over four decades.

And populations of birds, animals and fish that make their home in freshwater have tumbled by 70 per cent in the same time frame, the Living Planet report warns.

Freshwater creatures sliding towards extinction include river-dwelling dolphins and porpoises.

As residents of some of the world’s largest rivers, including the Ganges, Yangtze, Mekong and Amazon, they face a daily danger from dams, fishing nets, boats and pollution.

One species, the Yangtze river dolphin, may already be extinct.

The tiger’s future is also in jeopardy, with numbers across Asia down 70 per cent since 1980. Forced to compete for space in densely-populated regions, it roams just 7 per cent of the area it once did.

In sub-Saharan Africa, populations of hippos have been hit by the expansion of agriculture, abstraction of water and hunting for meat and ivory.

Numbers in the Democratic Republic of Congo fell by 95 per cent between 1960 and 2003.

Closer to home, overfishing is blamed for populations of Atlantic cod falling by 74 per cent in the past 50 years.

The report warns that people, and particularly rich nations, are exploiting resources such as water, forests and fisheries at a much higher rate than they can be replenished.

David Nussbaum, of the British arm of the WWF, said: ‘If we continue to use up our planet’s resources faster than it can replace them, soon we’ll have exploited every available corner of the Earth.’

Jonathan Baillie, the Zoological Society of London’s conservation programme director, added: ‘We can restore the planet’s health but only through addressing the root causes – population growth and over-consumption of resources.’
