Fatal error: Lorry driver Brian Coleman who was jailed after two men died when he did a U-turn on a dual carriageway

The driver of a recycling lorry who left two men dead after he did a U-turn on a dual carriageway has been jailed.

Brian Coleman, of Calne, Wiltshire, was convicted of causing the deaths by dangerous driving of Gareth Jones and Philip Wicks when he took the short cut across a major trunk road.

The 59-year-old former AA man claimed he had seen their van coming but thought he had time to complete the manoeuvre, not realising they were speeding.

Coleman pulled into a lay-by at Pretty Chimneys, between Chippenham and the M4, at about 7am on July 29 last year, so his work colleagues could collect some recycling material during his round for recycling firm Hills.

Coleman made the decision to complete a U-turn though a gap in the central reservation to collect recycling from properties on the other side of the road - a manoeuvre that was permitted on the road and he had completed in the past without difficulty.

But a Ford Transit van, driven by 25-year-old Mr Jones, smashed into the lorry at about 70mph, leaving the driver and Mr Wicks, his 30-year-old boss, with fatal head injuries.

Sentencing Coleman at Swindon Crown Court, Judge Douglas Field said: 'The manoeuvre you wished to take required particular care because of the large size of your lorry and the speed at which traffic was approaching from behind. In your mind you thought it was safe.

'You seriously misjudged the speed of the oncoming vehicles. Just before your manoeuvre was completed, the Transit van struck your vehicle with such force that it turned over. Two people were killed.

'I do take into account the Transit van was driving in excess of the allowed speed. It appears the van did not brake at all as it was coming towards you. It took no action.

'The families of Mr Jones and Mr Wicks have lost their loved ones. They were both young men with the rest of their lives ahead of them. They are greatly missed.'

The judge said Coleman had never been in any trouble in the past and was heading towards retirement with an unblemished driving record of over 30 years.

Coleman, dressed in a shirt and tie, stared straight ahead as the judge handed him two three-year sentences to run concurrently and a driving ban of three years.

Ian Lowrie QC, prosecuting, described Coleman's actions as an 'accumulation of errors', from pulling out across the carriageway to wrongly assessing the time he had to complete the manoeuvre.

He said the raw emotion of the families' grief was clear.

In mitigation Luke Blackburn told the court that Coleman, who is the sole carer for his wife, had an 'impeccable' character.

'He is summarised as a man who is well loved and respected and considered a reliable, steady figure and above all honest,' Mr Blackburn said.

'He nearly retired without so much as a speeding fine. He has driven hundreds of thousands of miles.'

Mr Blackburn said Coleman had suffered nightmares since the collision: 'He is not a man of stone and knows the effect of his driving on those two families.'
