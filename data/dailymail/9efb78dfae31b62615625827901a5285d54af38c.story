A young schoolteacher has received a barrage of abuse from angry banking customers because her internet profile is called ‘NatWest’.

Natalie Westerman, a 22-year-old from Newcastle upon Tyne, posts on social networking site Twitter under the name NatWest - because it is her nickname.

But since NatWest bank’s IT problems began causing chaos for its customers across the country, Ms Westerman has been receiving the brunt of people’s frustrations.

Spot the difference: Natalie Westerman, 22, has received a barrage of abuse over Twitter following the bank's IT problems - because her username is NatWest

The English and Media teacher has received more than 200 tweets from irate NatWest customers.

She said: 'I joined Twitter about five years ago, when it wasn’t such a huge thing and was only really big in America at the time.

'I chose the username NatWest because that has been my nickname since school.

'It wasn’t until about six months later that I started to get a few comments from people mistaking me for the bank.

'I would just re-direct them and tell them they had made a mistake.

'Companies such as NatWest had not actually started using Twitter yet.

'It is only in the last few years that the mistakes have become more frequent.

Not a bank: Ms Westerman has been sent a stream of abusive tweets - until users realise she is a woman and send her apologies

'I find it quite amusing to be honest. I have had a few abusive messages in the past but most of the time it’s just people asking me where their money is.'

Identity crisis: The English and media teacher says she finds the confusion funny - and won't be changing her name

Ms Westerman has set her profile description as ‘I’m a 22 year old woman and I’m not a bank’ - but still gets mistaken for the banking giant.

Bank boss Stephen Hester faced calls to resign today as the computer chaos at NatWest ran into a sixth day, prompting the Treasury to monitor the situation.

The bank was this morning still unable to confirm when customer accounts would be returned to normal - almost a week after a systems failure that has left wages unpaid and customers unable to withdraw money, pay bills or use credit cards.

Mr Hester, who is chief executive of the taxpayer-funded RBS Group, which owns NatWest, has promised that 'no one will be left permanently out of pocket' by the computer glitch.

A Twitter user called DAZER asked Ms Westerman: 'Oi @Natwest can I have my money please :('.

Hannah Gangoon told the young teacher, 'NATWEST NEED TO SORT IT OUT', while a user called ‘Mercedes’ branded her a ‘dunce’

Now that the true identity of ‘NatWest’ is becoming known, abusive Tweeters are backtracking and sending their apologies to Ms Westerman.

Twitter user Bethany Black said: 'Can I just apologise now for all the abuse you’ve had off me over the last year thinking you were the bank who f****d up my money.'

Ms Westerman has been replying to tweets and redirecting complaints to @natwest_help - the bank's actual account on the social networking site.

As the tweets continued to roll in, she wrote: 'Ive never felt so popular in my life. I am a person called nat west not a bank.'

She added: 'My friends find it hilarious when I tell them about all the messages I have received.

'I am a teacher and when I recently told the children about what had happened they found it very funny.

'I don’t think that I am going to change my username because I have got friends on Twitter from New Zealand and I don’t want to lose them.

'It does not really bother me when people do mistake me for the bank and it's just humorous more than anything.'
