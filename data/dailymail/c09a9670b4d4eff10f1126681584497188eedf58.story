The Health and Human Services Department said Monday it would extend by a week the deadline to sign up for Obamacare for enrollees who faced long wait times over the weekend or were unable to fill out an online form due to a computer glitch.

The last day to sign up for health insurance through the government was Sunday, Feb. 15. But as many as half a million Americans may have been unable to complete their applications on Saturday because an Internal Revenue Service function that verifies income was out of service.

The Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services, the agency with HHS responsible for implementing health care reform, said Monday that affected applicants would now have until Feb. 22 to enroll in healthcare insurance before they are assessed a fine.

HHS announced Monday that it would extend the deadline to Feb. 22 for Americans who had had problems signing up over the weekend

'We are pleased that the vast majority of consumers were able to apply and pick a plan through HealthCare.gov or its call center without a problem,' a spokesman for CMS, Aaron Albright, said in a statement on Monday.

'For those consumers who were unable to complete their enrollment because of longer than normal wait times at the call center in the last three days or because of a technical issue such as being unable to submit an application because their income could not be verified, we will provide them with a time-limited special enrollment period for March 1 coverage,' he said.

While the new deadline to apply for insurance is Feb. 22, coverage will not kick in until March 1 - the same date as it will become active for applicants who successfully enrolled by Feb. 15, CMS explained.

Eligible for the special enrollment period, CMS said, is those who 'attest' that they attempted to enroll by Feb. 15 but were unable to because of a computing error or 'extensive call center wait' times on Friday, Saturday or Sunday.  

According to USA Today, HHS discovered Saturday afternoon at roughly 2 p.m. that the income verification software wasn't working properly on healthcare websites. The publication says it took until 8 p.m. to fix the problem. 

Its unknown how much time elapsed before HHS became aware of the malfunction or how many people were kept from finalizing their health insurance requests. USA Today estimates that up to 500,000 were affected, however.

Several states with a healthcare marketplace announced a postponement of their deadlines on Sunday, as well. 

Maryland residents who experienced technical difficulties will have until Feb. 28 to resubmit their applications. Citing inclement weather, Massachusetts and Rhode Island gave their residents until Feb.23 to sign up. California resident who work with a certified enroller now have until Feb. 20.

Several states also delayed their enrollment deadlines on Sunday for varying reasons, including inclement weather

The problems plaguing the healthcare enrollment system over the weekend were reminiscent of the technical difficulties that beset the website at the close of the 2014 open enrollment period and overshadowed the health care mandate's first year in effect.

After a rocky start to the government-mandated program during which healthcare.gov was constantly beset with outages, the website again malfunctioned just before the March 31, 2014 deadline for uninsured Americans to get covered.

As a result, HHS had to delay until mid-April the cut-off. 

A few bugs aside, the healthcare website, having been reconstructed in the off-months, has proven sturdy during the second enrollment period, and HHS projects that a grand total of 9.9 million people could gain health insurance through state and federal marketplaces. 

The Congressional Budget Office optimistically predicts that 13 million Americans could sign up for healthcare through the government.

Anyone over the federal poverty line who does not have employer-based health insurance and does not register for Obamacare will be slapped by the IRS with a $325 fee or 2 percent of their income - whichever is greater.

That's up from the $95 per person or 1 percent of a household's income fee that was levied in 2014.

Concerned that many of their constituents are unaware of the greater fine, which averages out to $1,100 a household the Associated Press found, a group of senior Democrats in the House said they would the Obama administration to stretch out health care enrollment period for all Americans.

'Open enrollment period ended before many Americans filed their taxes,' Michigan Rep. Sander Levin, the member on the House Ways and Means Committee, Washington Rep. Jim McDermott and Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett told AP on Monday.

'Without a special enrollment period, many people (who will be paying fines) will not have another opportunity to get health coverage this year,' they said in a statement. 'A special enrollment period will not only help many Americans avoid making an even larger payment next year, but, more importantly, it will help them gain quality health insurance for 2015.' 

Republicans, on the other hand, would like to do away with Obamacare entirely. The GOP-led House of Representatives successfully passed repeal legislation earlier this month for the fourth time. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said his chamber would vote to rescind the legislation, as well.

Republicans lack a majority in neither chamber, and the White House has said it would veto any bill that dismantles the law, though. 

Alternatively, the GOP hopes a Supreme Court case looking at the legality of subsidies in Obamacare will topple the law once and for all.
