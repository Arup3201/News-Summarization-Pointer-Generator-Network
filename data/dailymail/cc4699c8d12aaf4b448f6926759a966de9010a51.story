American tennis player Victoria Duval, who lost in the second round at Wimbledon last week, has been diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma and will undergo immediate treatment for the cancer.

The player's management team said today that the 18-year-old was diagnosed after a biopsy was taken in England before Wimbledon and further tests in the United States confirmed the results.

The statement said Hodgkin's, the most common form of cancer in adolescents, 'was caught in a very early stage.'

It says Duval 'will undergo treatment right away and due to her overall good health and isolation of the cancer, the prognosis is a full recovery in a few months.'

Duval said in a statement: 'It is with a heavy heart that I will have to step away from tennis competition for a short period after being diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma.

'I received the news after my first round of qualifying at Wimbledon but decided to continue to compete. Being on court provided me with much comfort.

'I have complete faith that God will assist me and my family with all that we need, to achieve victory and become stronger from this journey.

'I intend to put up my best fight and have full recovery. I picture myself healthy, stronger and competing again soon with even more appreciation for the game I so love.

'I am grateful in advance to my fans and friends for their support and positive thoughts while I undergo my treatment and fight this battle.'

Duval reached the second round of the U.S. Open last year, beating 2011 champion Sam Stosur in the first round.

Her tennis career skyrocketed from the win, at just 17 years old.
