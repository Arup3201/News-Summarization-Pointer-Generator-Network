Jailed: Gavin Mills, 26, stopped to check if unconscious Jerzy Dubiniec, 60, was still alive then continued his frenzied attack

A killer who stopped to take the pulse of his victim before kicking him to death, has been jailed for life.

Gavin Mills, 26, stopped to check if unconscious Jerzy Dubiniec, 60, was still alive then continued his frenzied attack.

Hard-working grandfather Mr Dubiniec was kicked so hard he had shoe marks all over his clothes and chest.

A court heard Mills was high on cocaine and alcohol when he carried out the random attack on baker Mr Dubiniec who was on his way home from work.

Prosecutor Greg Taylor QC said: 'A witness heard a noise at 3.30am and looked out of their window to see a man lying in the road being kicked many times.

'He saw the attacker take the pulse of the man on the floor and then started kicking him again before leaving him lying in the road.'

Newport Crown Court heard Mr Dubiniec’s horrific injuries were so bad paramedics couldn’t treat him.

Mr Taylor said: 'When paramedics arrived they were unable to grip Mr Dubiniec’s jaw to check his airways because of his injuries.'

A post mortem examination found master baker Mr Dubiniec died from blunt injuries to his face, jaw and chest.

The court heard the much-loved grandfather had come out of retirement to help at a friend’s new bakery in Newport.

Mills, of Newport, was jailed for life after admitting murder.

Mr Justice John Griffith Williams said Mills must serve a minimum of 12-and-a-half years in jail.

He told him: 'Your ferocious kicks and stamps left shoe marks on Mr Dubiniec’s chest and clothing. You clearly intended to kill him.

'The fractures inflicted on Mr Dubiniec’s skull, face, ribs and sternum are some of the worst I have ever seen.'

The court heard Mills’ actions 'continue to have a lasting' effect on Mr Dubiniec’s family and friends.
