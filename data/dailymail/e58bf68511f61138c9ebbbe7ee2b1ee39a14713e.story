A man who devoted his life to retired circus elephants has been killed after being trampled by one of the mammals he loved so much.

Dr. James Laurita, 56, of Hope, Maine, was found dead at the Hope Foundation, the facility he co-founded that was dedicated to caring for elephants and educating the public about these animals, earlier today.

He appeared to have fallen before one of the foundation's two Asian circus elephants, Rosie and Opal, who then apparently stepped on him.

'The elephant was not aggressive in any way. It was clearly an accident,' Mark Belserene, administrator for the state medical examiner's office, told NBC.

He added that the official cause of death was 'asphyxiation and multiple fractures caused by compression of the chest.' 

Dr. Laurita, who sold his veterinarian business in 2011 to start the Hope Foundation, lived with his family nearby.

Along with his brother Tom, Dr. Laurita had worked with the Carson & Barnes Circus in the midwest as a youngster, and it was there that the two were assigned to work with elephants. 

That’s when they met Rosie and Opal according to The Bangor Daily News.

'Always in the back of my mind and my brother’s mind was that we wanted to do something for these elephants,' Dr, Laurita said in a 2012 interview, adding that he and his brother had known these two elephants for 'the last 30-something years.'

Before he started Hope Foundation, he had also worked at  the Bronx Zoo, as the head elephant trainer for a wildlife safari park in Oregon, and had even traveled to India to work with elephants.

'We want to make their lives more comfortable,' he once said of the majestic mammals. 

A tragic end for a man who gave so much.
