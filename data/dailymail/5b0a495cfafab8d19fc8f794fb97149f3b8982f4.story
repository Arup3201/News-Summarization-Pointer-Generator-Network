The U.S. Coast Guard says it rescued five people from the sailboat of a prominent Pinterest investor after the boat's 78-foot mast broke about 200 miles off the coast of North Carolina on Friday afternoon.

The $2.5 million luxury boat belonged to Pinterest investor Brian Cohen and he was on board with four others, some of whom were family.

A statement from the Coast Guard says watchstanders at a command center in Portsmouth, Virginia, were notified Friday afternoon that the 55-foot catamaran Rain Maker suffered a broken mast in 40 mph winds and 13-foot seas at roughly 1:50pm.

The damage occurred about 200 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.

A helicopter crew was able to hoist all five boaters from the damaged sailboat. The Coast Guard says the boaters were taken to Dare County Regional Airport in Manteo in good condition.

Wral reports that the Coast Guard rescue ship arrived at the damaged boat at about 4:05 p.m., but the 350-foot cargo ship was unable to come alongside the Rain Maker.

That's when a MH-60 Jayhawk helicopter arrived at about 5 p.m. and hoisted all five people from the water.

'The mission today was challenging for our crews due to the distance from shore and the weather conditions,' Petty Officer 1st Class Allen Facenda said in a statement.

'The crew we rescued had a registered and up-to-date emergency position indicating radio beacon that told us their exact position. All five people were wearing life jackets and were prepared to abandon their vessel in a life raft. We were happy to get there before that became necessary.'

Brian Cohen's luxury yacht was was profiled by Forbes last year.

According to Forbes, the boat can sail more than 30 m.p.h.

'What I love about this boat is it’s so disruptive, in so many ways,' Cohen told Forbes last year.

'The power of this boat, its disruptive technology, the design interface–it’s all part of the entrepreneurial experience in New York,' he said last year.

The yacht boasts two staterooms with interiors designed by Italian yacht-design firm Nauta Yachts.

Newfound love: Brain Cohen, pictured driving his luxury sailboat last year, didn't start sailing until he was 42-years-old and said he didn't know a 'mast from a sail'

Amenities: The boat has two stateroom with with interiors designed by Italian yacht-design firm Nauta Yachts

Kitchen: The boat has a fully operating kitchen onboard and was being sailed by Cohen and members of his family when it ran into difficulty

The boat has a 200 square-foot salon with coaches and Italian style flooring and is the perfect place to sip on martinis.

If on of the boat's passengers get hungry they can make their way over to the kitchen that even has a pizza oven. 

The enormous mainsail of the boat is made of 1,300 square feet of high-tech fabric. It has a computer-designed shape that can handle a broad range of wind.

The boat's cabin top is covered with solar cells that help charge an 800-watt electrical system that gives power to computer navigation screens, electric winches and a loud marine audio system.

Cohen told Forbes he didn't get into sailing until he was 42-years-old. 

 'I didn’t know a mast from a boom,' Cohen, now an avid sailor, said.

Yachts such as Cohen's are not know for their safety and can flip over if the wave hits it from the side.

The boat didn't flip but a broken mast left the family in a tight knot until the Coast Guard crew arrived.
