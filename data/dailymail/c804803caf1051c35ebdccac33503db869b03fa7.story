Britain  is still ‘deeply elitist’, with privately-educated pupils and Oxbridge graduates continuing to dominate the top roles in society, a new report warns.

Many of the nation’s judges, politicians, armed forces chiefs, journalists, TV executives and public officials attended fee-paying schools before studying at Oxford and Cambridge.

The Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission is calling for disadvantaged students from less prestigious universities to be fast-tracked into leading professions to correct the bias.

It wants leading employers to ignore the university background of applicants during recruitment rounds and publish data on the social background of all their members of staff.

The commission – an advisory body of the Department for Education – believes the move is necessary as its research shows the UK’s top jobs ‘remain disproportionately held by people from a narrow range of backgrounds’.

But critics fear that the recommendations for employers amount to discriminating against privately-educated pupils and warn against quotas. 

The commission analysed the education of more than 4,000 individuals holding the most prestigious jobs in British society and concluded that the country’s elite is still ‘formed on the playing fields of independent schools’ and ‘finished in Oxbridge’s dreaming spires’.

No less than 71 per cent of senior judges, almost two thirds of senior armed forces officers, more than half of senior diplomats, and over a third of the Cabinet attended a fee-paying school. David Cameron attended Eton and Oxford.

Nationally, around seven per cent of the UK population attended a private school.

The proportions were similar when the researchers examined who went to Oxford or Cambridge among the leading professions, even though 62 per cent of UK adults did not even attend university.

The commission says the ‘sheer scale of the dominance of certain backgrounds’ raises questions about whether getting a top job is about ability or knowing the right people.

It has called for a national effort to ‘break open’ Britain’s elite. It wants employers to use ‘contextual evaluation of academic achievements’ and ‘university-blind applications’ during recruitment drives.

This would involve bosses taking into account the family or school background of an applicant.

The commission also wants leading employers to publish data on the proportion of staff who have claimed free school meals, attended private schools and whose parents went to university.

Alan Milburn, its chairman, said yesterday: ‘Firms risk missing out on the best if they arbitrarily restrict recruitment rounds to certain institutions or cherry-pick applicants on the basis of university alone.’

The end of the grammar school system is believed to have helped widen class divisions. It meant that bright pupils from poor backgrounds no longer had the 11-plus exam as a means of getting ahead in education.

Former grammar school Prime Ministers include Harold Wilson, John Major and Margaret Thatcher.

Ruth Lea, economic adviser at Arbuthnot Banking Group, said the recommendation for companies to introduce ‘university-blind’ applications was ‘completely impractical’ and ignored the fact that a number of universities are known to excel at certain types of subjects.

Three quarters of all senior judges attended Oxbridge colleges according to new research published today
