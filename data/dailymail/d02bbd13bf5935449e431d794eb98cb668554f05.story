Nick Clegg made his debut as a radio talk show host today and faced a barrage of criticism from angry callers.

The Deputy Prime Minister was challenged on his new LBC 97.3 show over axing child benefit for high earners, capping increases in state handouts and raising tuition fees.

LBC presenter Nick Ferrari said the Lib Dem leader was making ‘radio history’ in signing up to the weekly phone-in, which concluded with the revelation that Mr Clegg owns a 'big green onesie'.

Nick Clegg hosted his first radio phone-in on LBC 97.3 and faced questions on benefit cuts, tuition fees and whether owned a onesie

In one of the first calls Mr Clegg came in for heavy criticism from a former Lib Dem county councillor who had quit the party after 39 years in protest at cuts to the welfare state.

The caller, John Doran from Woling in Surrey, told MailOnline he thought the party should stage a 'special conference' to get rid of Mr Clegg as party leader.

Nick Clegg struck a blow for the cool reputation of onesies when he became the most high profile politician to date who owns an all-in-one.

In the final question on his radio phone-in the Mr Clegg disclosed that he owned a 'big green' onesie - but he had never worn it.

'I
was given a big green onesie which I have kept in its packaging. I have
got one but I haven't worn it yet. It will be something I do in the 
privacy of my own home,' he added.

He later joked he was a 'Onesie Nation politician'.

The Prime Minister's spokesman declined to say whether David Cameron owned a onesie.

Earlier on the radio phone-in, Mr 
Doran told Mr Clegg: ‘I’m a Liberal Democrat who has just torn up his 
membership card."I'm a Liberal Democrat who's just torn up his 
membership card.

'I joined 
in 1973 and I'm afraid I can't now say I want to represent the Liberal 
Democrats. I'm an ex-county councillor in Surrey and I am ashamed of 
what the party's doing.'

He asked Mr Clegg if he had got his membership card with him, but the Lib Dem leader admitted he had not.

Mr
Doran read out the wording from the card which states that the Liberal 
Democrats exist to build and safeguard a fair, free and open society, in
which we seek to balance the fundamental values of liberty, equality 
and community, and in which no-one shall be enslaved by poverty, 
ignorance or conformity.’

He
said the party’s stated mission could not be reconciled ‘with this 
government’s attacks on the most vulnerable people in society’.

Mr Clegg insisted the party had 
delivered on promises to raise the income tax threshold and introduce a 
pupil premium for poorer children.

'I
am immensely proud that, facing the biggest crisis this country has 
seen in a generation, the Liberal Democrats took a big, collective and 
brave decision - at some political cost - to say we are going to step up
to the plate ... and fix this mess while also trying to make society 
fairer.'

Later Mr Doran told MailOnline he had not been able to tackle Mr Clegg over claims he made about the cuts being fair.

‘He didn’t cover all the things that the coalition is doing to damage people on benefits..

Mr Doran added: ‘I
am not talking about the proverbial scrounger. I am talking about the 
vast majority of the working poor who are having benefits cut at every 
opportunity

‘Neither party got a majority so neither has a mandate to do all this stuff.

‘There
are lots of different places there money could come from. I spend more 
on wine than Jobseekers Allowance in a week. I live in a nice big house.

'My
lifestyle has not been impacted by this government. We have lost a bit 
around the edges but compared to people who are struggling, worrying 
about feeding their kids, heating their homes.’

Later Labour frontbencher Angela Eagle described listening to the show as 'half an hour of my life I will never get back'.

The
shadow Commons leader accused Mr Clegg of refusing to take part in a 
show in his constituency, claiming he was 'hiding from the people of 
Sheffield'.

She told MPs: 
'Strangely, while the Deputy Prime Minister is keen to do a London 
phone-in, yesterday he refused to appear on a Radio Sheffield show to 
answer questions about the impact of Government cuts on his own 
constituency.'

Mr Clegg was also tackled over increases in tuition fees, defence cuts and which top Tory who would like to have a drink with

LBC 97.3 presenter Nick Ferrari said Mr Clegg was making 'radio history' as the first senior Cabinet minister to host a regular radio phone-in

In the final question the Mr Clegg disclosed that he owned a 'big green' onesie - but he had never worn it.

'I
was given a big green onesie which I have kept in its packaging. I have
got one but I haven't worn it yet. It will be something I do in the 
privacy of my own home,' he added.

The Prime Minister's spokesman declined to say whether David Cameron owned a onesie.

'I
know there was a Men's London Fashion Week event this week but I'm not 
not going to get into the habit of discussing those kinds of things,' he
told reporters.

Asked 
whether Mr Cameron listened to his deputy on the radio, the spokesman 
said: 'He was scheduled to be in meetings at that point.'

Mr
Clegg was also asked if pledging to cut tuition fees was 'the biggest 
regret of his political life'. But he would only concede it is 
'certainly' a big regret.

Another caller, a Sheffield University student called Lauren, dismissed measures like the pupil premium as 'tokenistic' and accused the Government of discouraging young people from gaining qualifications by abolishing the educational maintenance allowance and increasing tuition fees.

'It seems as if the coalition is trying to tell them that higher education is not for them,' said Lauren - a charge Mr Clegg did not accept.

The Deputy Prime Minister repeated his apology for committing the Lib Dems not to raise tuition fees when they were not in a position to deliver on the promise.

And he admitted that coming eighth in the Rotherham by-election was 'woeful'.

But he said it was always going to be 'monumentally controversial' for them to enter coalition with any other party, and said voters were willing to give their support when they had a chance to explain their actions.

'Where we can get on to people's doorstep or in front of a radio mike and explain to people what we are doing, why we are sticking to our guns on some of the big decisions, why the country has to go through this difficult process, I'm finding that people - perhaps not with bunting and wild-eyed enthusiasm - recognise that what we are doing is the right thing,' he said.

'What I'm trying to do is build a strong economy and a fair society.'

In a wide-ranging 30-minute slot, Mr Clegg also revealed Ken Clarke to be the top Tory he would most like to go for a drink with.

His first phone-in comes in the week of 
the Government's Mid-Term Review, which was seen as an attempt to 
relaunch the coalition at the halfway point in its planned five-year 
term.

He emerged largely unscathed from the first encounter but party strategists will be worried if every week is dominated by angry former Lib Dems.

LBC 97.3 broadcasts in Greater London but is available online across the UK.
