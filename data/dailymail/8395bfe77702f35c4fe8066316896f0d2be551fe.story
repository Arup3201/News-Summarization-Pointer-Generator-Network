CNN Silver Fox Anderson Cooper has added to his burgeoning property portfolio, picking up an historic 18-room Connecticut mansion for himself and boyfriend Benjamin Maisani, according to reports.

Sitting on over 210 acres in the affluent Litchfield County, the sprawling stone manor - called Rye House - is believed to have set back the 47-year-old news anchor between $5 million and $9 million, sources tell Page Six.

Built in 1908 and designed by celebrated architect Wilson Eyre - a founder of House & Garden magazine - the English Country estate measures at over 10,000 square feet, complete with a private four-bedroom guest wing.

The area is known for being home to the rich and famous, and is where Oscar winner Meryl Streep and her husband Don Gummer raised their four children.

No country home would be complete without a full-sized swimming pool and a garden house, right?

The 18-room home was restored about 15 years ago, preserving many of its original features

The manor sits on over 210 acres and has a gated front entrance with a security system

Daniel Day-Lewis and wife Rebecca Miller, Broadway legend Patti Lupone, actor Oliver Platt and Mamma Mia! star Christine Baranski also have houses in Lichtfield, according to Town Vibe.

Cooper and Maisani, who owns several bars in Manhattan, have been together for about five years.

Rye House marks yet another major real estate purchase for Cooper, who is said to earn about $11 million a year at CNN, and it remains in close proximity to his other properties.

The veteran TV journalist lives with Maisani in a renovated firehouse in New York's Greenwich Village, which he bought in September 2009 for $4.3 million.

In 2012 Cooper also bought a waterfront in the Hamptons hamlet of Quiogue for $1.7 million.

Rye House, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, includes an Olympic-sized swimming pool, tennis court and green house, according to vacation rental site VRBO.

It was previously owned by former Miss Connecticut Karen Shaw, who starred on Dallas and The A Team, and could fetch a nightly rental rate of $1,800.

Cooper, the son of famed socialite and jeans designer Gloria Vanderbilt, recently told Howard Stern: 'My mom’s made clear to me that there’s no trust fund.'

He said that not relying on Vanderbilt money has allowed him to stay motivated and prosper on his own.
