An Arizona mother is being investigated for allegedly contributing to the death of her newborn baby, who tested positive for methamphetamine, cocaine and marijuana.

According to a report by the Arizona Department of Child Safety, Amber Matuska, 31, of Tucson, neglected her son, Delmon Matuska, by exposing him to illegal substances during pregnancy.

The baby died at the hospital February 5, 2014, just two and a half hours after birth.

The medical examiner has ruled that the cause of death was 'prematurity with substance abuse by his mother as a contributing factor to his prematurity and subsequent death,' according to Tuscon News Now, 

Ms Matuska has not been charged in connection to her son's death due to a legal loophole in the negligent homicide statue, which states that children born within a mother's womb could be classified as a self-abortion.

The Tucson Police Department, who has been investigating the case for the past seven months, said that detectives are still trying to pinpoint when exactly baby Delmon was pronounced dead.

On the day of the baby's passing, police executed a search warrant at Matuska’s home, seizing cell phones, a counterfeit $20 bill and marijuana.

The 31-year-old woman has an extensive criminal record dating back to at least 2003, including multiple arrests on drug charges.

A month after Delmon's death, the woman was again arrested on narcotics charges, according to court records.

Her Facebook page indicates that Ms Matuska also has a 12-year-old child.
