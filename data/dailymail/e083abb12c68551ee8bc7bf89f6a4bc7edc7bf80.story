The 'Peking Man', an ancient human ancestor, donned clothes and may have been an expert fire-builder.

Scientists have built up a remarkable account of what life was like for the early human, who existed between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago.

They have been studying the Chinese cave where the Peking Man fossils were first discovered in 1923.

Scientists have re-excavated the cave in the village of Zhoukoudian, near Beijing, where fossils of early humans, dubbed the Peking Man, were initially found

The famous Peking Man skull went missing after in 1941 when it was being transported to the U.S. from China during WWII. Scientists have revisited the site to discover more details about our ancient ancestor

The re-excavation, in the village of Zhoukoudian, near Beijing, has unearthed fascinating details proving our ancestors were more advanced than previously believed.

The Peking Man was outfitted, wearing animal hides that had been softened using stone tools.

Belonging to the species Homo erectus, the Peking Man was able to make fire, work wood and bizarrely drilled holed in objects for as yet unknown reasons.

Using powerful microscopes, the scientists are examining tools used by the Peking Man to gain more details about their use.

Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Science said that a 3,000-year-old living room, or 'activity floor', had been discovered in the cave, containing what could be a fireplace.

Chen Shen, a curator at the Toronto Museum and a special member of the academy, said that it was also likely the species had attached stone points to sticks, creating spears.

The discovery could be significant as it shows the Peking Man potentially joining two materials to form a tool.

The Chinese cave system is one of the most important Palaeolithic sites ever discovered.

Archaeologists unearthed thousands of stone tools and hundreds of fragmentary remains from about 40 early humans as they worked on the site between 1921 and 1966.

The human remains discovered in the cave were later assigned to the species Homo erectus.

The original fossils of the Peking Man vanished in 1941 as they were being transported to America at the peak of World War II.

A number of techniques have attempted to accurately date the remains numerous times over the years but have failed to find a definitive answer.

Early discovery: Scientists originally found the fossilised remains of the Peking Man in 1923 but only now are they establishing details, such as that the homo erectus species may have been able to build and master fire

Scientists believe the discoveries at the Zhoukoudian cave may finally prove that the Peking Man could control fire despite the low temperatures of northern China.

The team also believes that the Peking Man was working wood, with the possibility that they were creating wooden tools.

While the exact details of the dig have not been finalised, the initial findings will fascinate scientists.

The fossils revealed that the ancestors drilled holes but scientists have no idea what purpose this activity fulfilled.

The findings may also be significant because of their timing with scientists in South Africa recently discovered that another early human ancestor was making spears 500,000 years ago.

Swedish 
scientist Johan Gunnar Andersson and American colleague Walter W. 
Granger first arrived in Zhoukoudian in 1921 where they were directed to
 the site by quarrymen.

Upon arrival at the cave Andersson announced: 'Here is primitive man, now all we have to do is find him.'

The
 confidence was well-founded as the scientists had just discovered what 
would become one of the most important paleontological sites in the 
world.

Anderrson
 found human molars at the site but it was Canadian scientist Davidson 
Black who made some of the most significant discoveries, despite his 
initial findings being treated with scepticism by scientists around the 
world.

Around 200 fossils were gathered until excavation came to an end in 1937 with the Japanese invasion.

Fossils
 were placed in the Cenozoic Research Laboratory of the Peking Union 
Medical College for safe-keeping, before being packed up for the U.S. in
 1941.

But the fossils were inexplicably lost as they were being transported through northern China.

It is still unknown what happened to the fossils with some believing they sank on Japanese ship the Awa Maru in 1945.

U.S.
 financier Christopher Janus appealed for information on their 
whereabouts in 1972, promising a reward of $5,000. One woman made 
contact, demanding $500,000, but this failed to materialise.

The
 Chinese Government also initiated a committee to locate the fossils to 
coincide with the 60th anniversary of the end of WWII.
