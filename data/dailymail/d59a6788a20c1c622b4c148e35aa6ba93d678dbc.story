Roman Kreuziger's Tinkoff-Saxo team have hit back at UCI president Brian Cookson after he criticised their selection of the rider for the Tour of Poland.

Tinkoff-Saxo published an open letter to Cookson criticising comments he made after the Czech Republic rider was provisionally suspended based on biological passport irregularities.

Kreuziger was omitted from Tinkoff-Saxo's Tour de France squad and, his team say, was not suspended, by them or the UCI, until he was selected for this month's Tour of Poland.

The letter from Tinkoff-Saxo managing director read Stefano Feltrin followed a series of messages from team owner Oleg Tinkoff on Twitter, threatening legal action against the UCI, although many of the Russian's comments on the social networking site should be taken with a pinch of salt.

The team do, however, take issue with comments made by Cookson in an interview with cyclingnews.com, when the Briton criticised Kreuziger's selection for the Tour of Poland. 

UCI president: Brian Cookson criticised Tinkoff-Saxo's selection of Roman Kreuziger for the Tour of Poland

Suspended: Cyclist Roman Kreuziger was supposed to take part in the Tinkoff-Saxo's Tour of Poland

The letter read: 'What seems inexplicable to us is how UCI can decide that from a certain moment in time but also retroactively the interpretation of the rule, that riders will not be provisionally suspended for alleged blood passport violations, which has applied since 2011 when the blood passport was introduced, shall be revised. What changed on August 1st, 2014?

'It seems to us that (a) a penalty to a rider shall be applied only based on very precise and verified circumstances (b) UCI and yourself (Cookson) have written that the provisional suspension is imposed because it is likely that the rider's results will be affected by the asserted anti-doping rule violation - thus you believe he is guilty; and (c) we believe that justice shall be administered treating all cases in the same manner and not on a case by case basis.'

The open letter concluded: 'This team is fully committed to the fight against doping in sport, to the use of the biological passport and to the application of strict anti-doping rules but does believe this should be conducted in a manner that respects the facts and proper process, guarantees proper defence right and do not jeopardise the team's ability to plan properly when hiring riders and select a team to participate in a race.'
