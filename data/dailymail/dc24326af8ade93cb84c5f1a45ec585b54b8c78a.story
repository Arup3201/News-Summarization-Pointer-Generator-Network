Of all the things you can roast, matchday tickets for a Championship match do not normally come high up on the list.

However a Norwich City fan was left stunned when he noticed his mum had accidentally roasted 16 tickets for the Canaries' upcoming match against Brighton.

Mikey Knights' mum put the tickets, worth £500, into the oven along with a chicken on Tuesday as she prepared dinner for her son.

The tickets for Norwich's away match against Brighton on April 3 came out black and unreadable after being in the oven for approximately 40 minutes.

Luckily for Mr Knights, Brighton have agreed to reprint the tickets in time for the league match at the Amex Stadium.

'I went round for tea on Tuesday and my mum asked me if I was in a good mood. I said "yes",' Knights told the BBC.

'Then I was told the football tickets had got roasted. There were the tickets, roasting away nicely. I thought it was a wind-up at first, but then I opened the envelope and the 16 tickets were inside, all black.

'There wouldn't usually be this many tickets to cook, but as the match is on Good Friday more people wanted to come along.

'I've already got my train tickets, but it's a good job those didn't go to my mum's address. She might have put them in for afters.'
