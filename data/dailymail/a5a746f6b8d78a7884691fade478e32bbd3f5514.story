Bayern Munich will revive their interest in a deal for Chelsea’s David Luiz this summer.

Coach Pep Guardiola had flirted with the idea of bringing in Thiago Silva from Paris Saint-Germain but accepts there are too many obstacles in the way of that particular deal.

He has been impressed with Luiz's adoption of a more serious outlook to his game under Rafa Benitez last season and believes he could implement his ideals of utilising the ball better from central defensive positions at Bayern.

At this stage of his thinking, it would be at the expense of Jerome Boateng, who could revert either to full back or be dropped to the bench.

As Sportsmail revealed last summer, despite the protestations, Jose Mourinho has been willing to examine offers for Juan Mata and Luiz, with the Spaniard signing for Manchester United

Mourinho wants to continue rebuilding at Chelsea with a top striker and defender such as Kurt Zouma of St Etienne.

Balancing this out against the implications of Financial Fair Play means they will listen to offers around £35m for Luiz, which would leave them able to sign Zouma for around £10m and leave space for Atletico Madrid’s Diego Costa at £36m plus. The pursuit of Southampton’s Luke Shaw may prompt another departure though.

Chelsea sent French scout Guy Hillion to Monaco’s Stade Louis II on Sunday to watch Marseille starlet Florian Thauvin but he failed to get a ringing endorsement from former Chelsea defender Frank Leboeuf, who was commentating for RMC Sport.

Marseille lost 2-0 to Monaco and forward Thauvin, 21, who is a former target of Newcastle and Arsenal, was replaced after an hour by Dimitri Payet.

Leboeuf said: ‘Thauvin didn’t exist for an hour. There was one moment where he had the ball and he tried to knock it past the defender and go round the other side, and you wonder where he’s going.

'Wait for your team-mates to arrive, keep the ball. Football isn’t played with 11 balls.’

Speaking from experience: Marseille defender Florian Thauvin didn't impress Chelsea legend Frank Lebouef

Meanwhile, Gael Kakuta has returned to Chelsea from his loan at Vitesse Arnhem and is looking for a fresh move to kickstart his career at 22.

Talking to L’Equipe, scout Hillion said: ‘It’s a huge waste, because I’ve already said it and I’ll repeat it: he was the most talented one of his generation. He could be exceptional. But talent is not enough. There comes a time, when you accumulate failures, that there are problems at every club you go to, you have to ask yourself the right questions and question yourself.

'Because before Arnhem, there was Bolton, Fulham and Dijon. You can’t manage everything in a player’s career. You can’t manage what is on his mind, his entourage or his family.’

Manchester United scouts were at Carlisle on Tuesday night as they watched MK Dons midfielder Dele Alli.

The 6ft 2in teenage powerhouse has been studied by Arsenal and Liverpool this season with Brendan Rodgers watching for himself at the recent FA Cup tie between Wigan and MK Dons.

The League One side want more than £2million for the 17-year-old and most scouts believe he is over-priced.

The England U17 star definitely has talent but is still considered a work in progress. Bids could yet be in the pipeline but unlikely to be at the desired amount for Dons. Alli shook off a calf injury to play on Tuesday night but was taken off at half-time as his ailing side slipped to a 3-0 defeat. United will continue to monitor his progress.

In terms of immediate first team signings, manager David Moyes is resigned to being unable to prise Luke Shaw from Southampton although he is trying. He has not made a bid for left back Fabio Coentrao at Real Madrid nor one for midfielder Fernando at Porto.

Inter Milan have been trying to revive a deal for United winger Nani. The Portuguese has a hamstring injury which will rule him out for a couple more weeks but Inter are desperate for fresh impetus. They have asked for a loan with a view to a permanent deal and may try to tempt United again with Fredy Guarin. Moyes has so far snubbed offers to take the Colombian.

There were a few faces in the crowd at Aldershot on Monday as Arsenal U21s beat London rivals Chelsea 1-0 to go through to the Under 21 Premier League Cup semi finals.

Arsenal’s Benik Afobe scored the decisive goal in the 106th minute in front of watching Sheffield Wednesday manager Stuart Gray and that could result in a loan move to Hillsborough for the 20-year-old.

A deal may depend on who Arsenal bring in themselves over the next 48 hours as injuries mount for Arsene Wenger. A delegation has travelled to Germany to discuss the possibilities of a deal for Schalke’s Julian Draxler.

The Germany attacking midfielder has been in Munich receiving treatment on his ankle ligament injury from Hans Muller Wohlfahrt and has begun light training but will not be fit for another three weeks.

Brentford coach David Weir was also in the crowd at Aldershot as was Leeds United’s Luke Dowling and Stellar Group agent David Manasseh, who represents a few of Arsenal’s youngsters.
