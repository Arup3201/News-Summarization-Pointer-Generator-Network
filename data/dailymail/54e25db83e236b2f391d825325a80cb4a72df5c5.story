Disgraced former MP Chris Huhne, who has been given a pass granting him access to Parliament despite having served a jail term 

Disgraced Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne has been given a pass granting him access to Parliament two years – despite having just served a jail term for perverting the course of justice.

The former Energy Secretary quit as an MP after pleading guilty to the charge, after trying to cover up the fact that he had swapped speeding points with his ex-wife, Vicky Pryce. He was sentenced to eight months in prison.

Nevertheless, a Freedom of Information request has revealed he is among 360 former MPs who have been granted a Commons pass.

The lucky recipients may use Westminster’s heavily subsidised bars and restaurants, as well as other facilities.

Passholders include former Conservative minister Jonathan Aitken, who was jailed in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice, as well as several ex-MPs who left the House in the 2010 election following the expenses scandal.

Derek Conway had the Conservative whip withdrawn and then stepped down after being heavily censured for putting his son on the public pay-roll without apparently giving him any duties.

Labour’s Ben Chapman declined to stand again after it emerged he had overclaimed on his mortgage by £15,000, while his party colleague Harry Cohen had a £65,000 resettlement grant withheld to make up for wrongly claimed accommodation expenses.

‘I do not think someone who has committed a criminal offence that has meant they went to prison should get privileged access to the Houses of Parliament,’ Labour backbencher John Mann said.

‘Let them queue with the general public if they want to get in.’

He warned that the list of passholders ‘reinforces the impression that this is a gentlemen’s club’.

Mr Mann also raised concerns about the potential for lobbying current MPs, as many former members who hold passes have taken up roles in the private sector.

A Freedom of Information request has revealed that Mr Huhne is among among 360 former MPs who have been granted a pass for the Commons 

‘Why should people who have been beaten in an election have special privileges?’ he asked. ‘What these positions are generally used for is people making money through their parliamentary contacts.’

After leaving Parliament Mr Huhne set up a consultancy firm, Chris Huhne and Associates. He also has a two-day-a-week role as European chief of an American energy company.

Ex-Labour MP Jim Devine, who was jailed for 16 months for making false expenses claims in 2011, was reported to have had a parliamentary pass that year. However, he does not feature on the list.
