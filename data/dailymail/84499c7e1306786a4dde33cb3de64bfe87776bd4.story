Happy couple: Margaret Hanrahan and Miley Doran, both 18, threw a lavish Gypsy wedding

Riot police had to attend the filming of a new episode of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding after the couple's reception ended in a mass brawl.

Riot police were called to where Channel 4 were filming the nuptials of Margaret Hanrahan and Miley Doran, both 18, last week for a special edition of the hit documentary show.

Gatecrashers brawled with guests at the reception in the Park Inn Hotel, West Drayton, believed to have resulted in one person being stabbed. 

One hotel guest, who asked not to be 
named, told the Daily Mirror: 'There were massive dresses, cars coming 
and going and then fights. It was intimidating.'

A
spokesman for the MET police said that while officers were called to a 
disturbance at the hotel, no crimes were reported and no one was 
arrested.

In 
typically gypsy style, Margaret wore an extravagant white princess dress
and travelled to the traditional church service in a white Rolls Royce.

Her 11 bridesmaids were dressed in shocking pink gowns and travelled in a matching pink limo.

Guests
had only been told the location of the wedding that morning to try and 
prevent any gatecrashers but a group of uninvited travellers turned up 
towards the end of the night causing a fight.

But
Bomboniera Events' Sally Cherri, a wedding planner who organised the 
lavish event, said the late drama failed to spoil the special day.

She said: 'I've planned
hundreds of weddings but this was my first ever Gypsy wedding and 
despite what happened at the end I would still love to do more.

'The couple were getting a lot of discrimination when they were trying to book things for the day so they came to me.

'It was a really pleasant wedding to organise because the bride was so relaxed.

'Travellers weddings are known for being 
extravagant and this was no different. They wanted glitz and glitter, 
and that's what they got.

'It was an amazing day and everyone was having a great time until about 11pm when some gatecrashers arrived.

'The
couple only released the location of the reception that morning to try 
and prevent just that from happening as travellers often just turn up at
weddings.

'I know one of the gatecrashers was cut on their head and there was smashed glass and blood outside.

The venue turned the music off and some of the older guests managed to get the gatecrashers to leave.

'Around 100 riot police had turned up and it was a very intense moment. It was a little bit scary.

'The couple were really upset and the bride was pretty distraught. They just wanted to enjoy their day.

The bride and her bridesmaids all wore huge gowns typically of a travellers wedding - similar to a previous My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding bride Bridget, pictured above with her bridesmaids

Bigger the better: Brides on the TV show such as barmaid Sam, 17, a non-gypsy who married her gypsy boyfriend, Pat, believe the dress should be as big as possible

'I spoke to the venue manager and we agreed to get the music back on so the couple could go back to enjoying their reception.

'It was over quite quickly and everyone went back to having a good time. It was still an amazing day despite that one little incident.

'Travellers get a lot of discrimination and I feel it's really unfair as they're lovely people and it's a very small minority that cause trouble.

'They're just like everyone else and want to be able to celebrate their wedding and have a good time.'

The wedding, between Margaret Hanrahan, of Hampton, and Miley Doran, of Croydon, both 18, is expected to be aired on Channel 4 early next year.

Sally Cherri, owner of Bomboniera Events which organised the wedding, said the day was still amazing despite the incident
