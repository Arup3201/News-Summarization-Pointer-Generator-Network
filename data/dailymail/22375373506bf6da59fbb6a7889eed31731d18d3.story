For North Koreans, the annual Arirang Mass Games was one of the most exciting events of the year. But now, with dictator Kim Jong Un shelving plans for 2015 due to lack of funds for lack of funds, people will have to look elsewhere for entertainment.

'It was billed as one of the biggest and most impressive performances in the world,' explains photographer Eric Lafforgue who attended the last Arirang Mass Games in 2013.

'All over Pyongyang you could see  Arirang adverts talking about the "grand mass gymnastic and artistic performances" which the regime said even the opening ceremony for the Olympics couldn't better.'

Spectacular: The colourful Arirang Mass Games started life in 1946 and were initiated by Kim Il Sung

Kimilsungia: Dancers carry symbols of the Kim dynasty, in this case representations of the Kimilsungia - a type of purple orchid

Choreography: The Mass Games involve 100,000 performers, all either doing gymnastics or dancing

End of an era: Kim Jong Un has said the Mass Games won't be held in 2015 - and possibly never again

But the future of the event, which began in 1946 and was last held in 2013, looks increasingly uncertain, with Kim Jong Un's regime seemingly set on shelving the Arirang altogether.

Designed to promote the Workers Party of Korea, the armed forces and the Kim dynasty, the Arirang Festival started life in 1946 and was, from the start, littered with regime iconography.

Rising suns, which represent Kim Il Sung, feature heavily in the costumes, as do guns which are a reference to Sung passing 'the struggle' on to his son Kim Jong Il and grandson Kim Jong Un.

Flowers are a popular prop, with red representing workers and purple the Kim dynasty. Unsurprisingly, many are Kimilsungia, a type of purple orchid, and Kimjongilia, a crimson begonia.

Big day: The event was held at Pyongyang's main stadium and usually had a military flavour

Free pass: Soldiers were given free tickets to the event as a reward for good behaviour

Celebration: The military personnel were there to see the army - and the ruling Kim dynasty - celebrated

Practice: In the months leading up to the event, Pyongyang was the scene of regular drills

Getting it right: Instructors with loudspeakers told the massed ranks of gymnasts exactly what to do

Result: The colourful spectacle that ensued was the result of months of training

Symbolism: Many of the dances symbolised workers, with apples and girls in iridescent dresses seen here standing in for farmers

Tribute: Other tableaux focused on the Kim dynasty. These gymnasts are holding Kimjongilias - a type of crimson begonia

Colour symbolism: These sailors are followed by gymnasts holding Kimiljongias and purple fans - both representative of the regime

Kim's colours: Clutching Kimjongilias and dressed in purple, these gymnasts are advertising their loyalty to the regime

Tough job: Many of the performers, in particularly the gymnasts, are drawn from local schools

Armed forces: Attractive female soldiers also play a big role in proceedings, their job to highlight the armed forces

Impressive: Another highlight of the Arirang Mass Games were the mass military parades - complete with giant flags

Popular: All members of the armed forces were represented, whether sailors, soldiers or pilots

But propaganda aside, what really makes the Arirang Mass Games stand out are the sheer numbers involved. '100,000 athletes took part in the show I saw,' explains Lafforgue.

'Then, there were 20,000 teenagers sitting at the back of the stadium holding cards and making pictures. To make a soldier, 2000 of them were needed while it took all 20,000 to make a Korean flag.'

Awe-inspiring though the sight was, Lafforgue says some of the people-art hints at North Korea's more sinister ambitions. 'Some of them showed atoms, which symbolise the nuclear bomb, while others showed the two Koreas together under the Kim dynasty's rule.'

The show also has a military flavour, with sexy female soldiers in uniforms and garters sent out to dance in front of troops, mostly men, who had been given a free pass to the show as a reward for good behaviour.

Despite its massive scale, the Arirang lasts for just one hour with attendees going straight home afterwards. 'All the thousands of people in the stadium just vanished into the streets,' Lafforgue recalls.

'Pyongyang's streets are really dark and quiet so the contrast with the stadium was almost shocking. It felt very unreal, like being in a terrifying and fantastic alternate universe.' 

Surreal: Whirling gymnasts in green and white combine to create a psychedelic scene 

Well-rehearsed: A group of girls, all dressed in Kim dynasty purple, march en masse

Extraordinary: Thousands of performers take part in each Arirang Mass Games, although the future is now uncertain

One for the workers: The colour red is also used to symbolise the workers, Communism and the Kims

Pretty: Rows of dancers clutching fans designed to look like Kimilsungia orchids perform at the Mass Games

Unusual combination: Each segment combined dance and gymnastics with the marching military

Alternate universe: Photographer Eric Lafforgue says watching the performances was like being in a different universe

Elaborate: This scene references Kim Jong Il's birth, which, according to North Korean myth, took place in a mountain log cabin

Showing allegiance: This tableaux features the Communist flag, complete with the hammer and sickle once used by the USSR (now Russia)

Vast: The Mass Games take over Pyongang's central stadium for the last time in 2013
