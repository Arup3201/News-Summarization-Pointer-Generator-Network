Dozens of mothers have donated breast milk for a six-month-old baby whose mother recently died from a heart attack.

Liz Marquez, a 32-year-old mother of five from Diamond Bar, California, suffered cardiac arrest on December 7 and was taken off life support nine days later, leaving behind Brixton, her premature son, whom she'd planned to breastfeed for at least a year.

Mrs Marquez's friend Kristina Pulistar quickly launched the Milk for Brixton Project, a campaign to collect breast milk from local mothers.

She told CBS Los Angeles: 'The first thought in my head was, oh my gosh, the baby. I knew that she was using breast milk with Brixton, and immediately I just went straight to finding donor milk for her.'

Ms Pulistar, 29, sought support from Mrs Marquez's friends in their local community of mothers and from breastfeeding advocate Vanessa Simmons, who shared the family's story on her website, Normalize Breastfeeding.

Brixton's father, Brian Marquez, told Normalize Breastfeeding: 'I know how important it was to my wife that our child be purely breastfed for at least one year. I feel it's part of my commitment to carry that goal out for my wife.'

Mrs Marquez was particularly determined to provide breast milk for Brixton, who was born prematurely at just 32 weeks, because she saw how much it 'helped him through his many trials in the beginning of his life and his NICU stay,' according to Ms Pulistar. 

However, Mrs Marquez had struggled to produce enough breast milk to feed Brixton and began using milk donated by local moms, according to her childhood friend, La Nina W.

Successful project: Milk for Brixton has now received more than 4,500 ounces of breast milk from local mothers

Milk for Brixton has now received more than 4,500 ounces of milk and has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for a deep freezer to store the milk and gas for drop-offs and pick-ups at 13 locations near the Marquez family's California home.

For safety reasons, Ms Pulistar told The Stir that the organization will not accept donations from women who 'smoke, drink, or take recreational or prescription drugs.'

The crowd-funding campaign has earned more than $1,000, and Ms Pulistar told The Huffington Post that the project even caught the attention of actress Alyssa Milano, who donated gas cards to the cause. 

Ms Pulistar said that the response has been 'unbelievable', adding that she hopes to help other families with babies in need of breast milk.

'I would even like to help infants who have mothers with illnesses that prevent them from being breastfeed. I want to make a difference and normalize donor milk sharing!' she said.

'Liz was an amazing woman and mother. Her children were her world. She always held them close and did everything for them.'
