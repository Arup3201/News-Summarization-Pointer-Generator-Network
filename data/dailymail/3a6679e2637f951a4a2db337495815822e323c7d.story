Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon remains a doubt for Friday's World Cup match against Costa Rica, and centre back Andrea Barzagli could also be missing after injury problems.

Buffon twisted his left ankle and knee before the Azzurri's opening game against England and watched from the bench as Salvatore Sirigu filled in admirably for him in a 2-1 win while Barzagli has a tendinitis problem.

Anything but a win for Italy in their second Group D game would send England crashing out of the World Cup, so Three Lions supporters will be praying for the fitness of the legendary Italian 'keeper and the Azzurri's first choice centre back.

Getting there: Buffon trained for Italy on Thursday but is still suffering from swelling to his injured ankle

Missing link: Key defender Barzagli could be the latest player that the Italians lose to injury

Coach Cesare Prandelli said Buffon: 'had three great days of training but the ankle is still slightly swollen. If he feels good after today's training he'll play.'

Barzagli was held out of training Wednesday due to a tendinitis problem that bothered him all season with Italian champions Juventus.

Key duo: Buffon and Barzagli would be a couple of big misses for the Italians if they are ruled out by injury

Able deputy: Sirigu performed well in Buffon's absence and could be called upon again by Prandelli

'Barzagli is better but we'll evaluate him tomorrow morning,' Prandelli said.

If Barzagli is unable to play, Leonardo Bonucci could take over in defense alongside Giorgio Chiellini.

Easy does it: Buffon saves a shot during the session but might not be back in time to face Costa Rica
