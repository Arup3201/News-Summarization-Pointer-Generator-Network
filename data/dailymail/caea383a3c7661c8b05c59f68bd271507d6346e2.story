An historic Welsh castle has gone on the market as the perfect hideaway for anyone seeking solitude and privacy - and glamour.

Westbury Castle in Flintshire, North Wales, is on the market with a price tag of £5 million.

Just two years ago it was sold for £1.8m, but since then a small fortune has been spent dragging it into the 21st century.

Westbury Castle in Flintshire, North Wales - described as the perfect hideaway for anyone seeking solitude and privacy - and glamour

Built in the 1880s, Westbury Castle has had £2 million spent on it so far to bring it up to date

The 200-year-old Grade II listed property has been described as Wales’s own Downton Abbey - its West wing could accommodate 56 servants.

The wing has been converted into 11 luxury apartments although only three have so far been completed.

But the mock-Gothic castle’s original features have been preserved including heraldic medallions and a decorative fireplace in the hallway.

It has a State Dining Room which the estate agent’s blurb says is 'an impressive space to entertain guests with original features such as an ornate stone fireplace and perimeter oak panelling'.

 Castle, which was once the ancestral home of the aristocratic Mostyn 
family, stands in seven acres and has its own six hole golf course.

The cast from ITV's hugely popular series Downton Abbey - the hit show has sparked a new interest in grand living. Westbury Castle has been described as Wales' own Downton Abbey

In the grounds there is a small abbey, a three bedroomed detached lodge and a riding school which can be developed into a five-bedroomed house.

Developer and owner Ian Ringwood, 33, said: 'I will have spent around £2m by the time I have finished restoring the property.

'The west wing was in a really poor state - the whole thing needed re-wiring and was full of damp. The roof was in a bad state.

'But the main house was okay - it just needed updating.'

Plush carpets and gilded furniture: one of eight double bedrooms

A view of the bedroom from another angle: curtain pelmets, chaise longues and original fireplaces

Wow factor: another bedroom with a solid four-poster bed. More masculine and with a hint of Scotland

Panelled windows, luxurious curtains and thick carpets

Old and new: thick curtains, ornate mirror, old-style bathtub, striped wallpaper and a chandelier. And a modern walk-in shower unit

The castle stands in seven acres and has its own six hole golf course - but it was once in a poor state with damp and in need of complete re-wiring

The estate agents say the castle would make a superb home for a celebrity looking for a hideaway in the Welsh hills.

But they are expecting a developer to come in and turn the castle into a hotel or exclusive wedding venue.
