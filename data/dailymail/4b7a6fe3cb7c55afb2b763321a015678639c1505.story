Singing Jerusalem and eating Victoria sponge have been shoved aside at one Women's Institute branch after they decided to diversify its activities - and plumped for pole dancing lessons.

Daring moves are being taught to members based in Little Stanion, Northamptonshire, as they want to revamp aspects of the conservative organisation.

The newly formed group held its first meeting on Tuesday, where they were treated to a kinky display of pole dancing from instructor Sinnead O'Donnell. 

Modern WI: These members in Northamptonshire wanted to spice up the experience - so brought in a pole dancing instructor

After demonstrating a few moves at village's primary school, flexible Sinnead then invited WI members to have
a go at their own sexy routine.

And it appears that the women went wild and it brought in curious new members.

Member Irene Screen, 33 said: 'It was the pole dancing 
that brought me here. I wanted to find out more about it and I really 
enjoyed the evening.'

Karen Attrill, 53, added: 'I've never been to a WI meeting before but I'll definitely consider coming back now.'

President of the branch Rachel MacAllister, 28, said: 'It's not all jam and Jerusalem, the reality is different.

'We're planning to set up a book club and to hold pamper evenings and 
wine-tasting sessions, as well as the more traditional activities.'

The pole dancer said it is a sign that the WI is moving into the modern age, as the activity is fun and good for the health.

Mother-of-two Ms O'Donnell, 24, said: 'Pole dancing is a great laugh and a fantastic way to get into shape and keep fit.

'I took it up after I had my second child and I taught pole dancing for a year.

'It's lost its seedy image now and is just a great way to build up body strength, have fun and meet new friends.

'People can either go to classes, or buy their own pole and do it at home. It's brilliant. It's physically and mentally challenging and women of any age can enjoy it.'

Women's Institute HQ in London today welcomed the news.

Ruth Bond, Chair of the National Federation of Women’s Institute, said: 'We are delighted to hear about every new WI and Little Stanion WI is no exception.  Women are attracted by the chance to try exciting and unusual activities; informal learning and new skills; and getting involved in campaigning on a wide range of issues. 

'We believe the WI has something for everyone'
