A 14-year-old who killed his 78-year-old great grandmother with a hatchet broke down sobbing in court as he was sentenced on Monday.

Antonio Barbeau has been sentenced to spend at least 36 years in jail over the murder, making him eligible for parole when he is 50-years-old.

Barbeau tried reading an apologetic statement but started crying, passing it off to his defense attorney who also had to fight back tears while doing his best to read the statement.

Crying in court: Antonio Barbeau had tears running down his face when he was sentenced to at least 36 years behind bars on Monday after his killing of his great grandmother

Breaking down: Both Barbeau and his attorney George Limbeck were in tears as they tried to read out his apologetic statement to his relatives in court

Barbeau and his friend Nathan Paape were previously found guilty of killing Barbara Olson in her Sheboygan, Wisconsin home using a hatchet

She invited them into her home and as she turned her back to call Barbeau's mother, Barbeau hit her on the head with the hatchet, the Shaboygan Press reported.

He said he then ran to the bathroom as he was feeling sick but that when he emerged, he saw Paape hit the woman with the hammer multiple times.

Judge Timothy Van Akkeren said that the sentence was 'the minimum' based on the crime, which he described as 'nothing short of horrific'.

In for a long time: The earliest Barbeau, 14, will be able to be up for parole is in 36 years when he is 50

'In my 24 years on the bench, I’ve not seen anything of this nature. Not even close,' he said during his ruling.

The court held that Barbeau had a brain injury from a 2009 car accident that left him with 'unspecified cognitive disorder' that played a role in his decision to commit a crime.

That mental issue was not enough to disregard the brutal nature of the murder.

'I feel bad for the family. I know they love him. But this type of crime cannot go unanswered and be explained away by brain trauma,' district attorney Joe DeCecco said.

'The kid’s life is gone. He has to wait until he’s 50. He won’t be anything like he is today. But that’s the way it is.'

Testimony: Antonio Barbeau, pictured at an earlier court appearance, raises his hand to take the oath before testifying during a trial for his friend Nathan Paape, with whom he allegedly killed his great-grandmother last year

'Accomplice': Nathan Paape, Barbeau's friend who was a co-conspirator in the attack, has pleaded not guilty

Weapon: Sheboygan Falls Police officer Nicole Schmelter holds up an axe allegedly from the crime

The teen's grandmother- who is the daughter of his victim- read a statement of her own that also had Barbeau weeping.

'My
mom was not a vindictive person. She would want (Antonio) to have a 
chance to be a better person, to have hope, to have something to work 
towards,' grandmother Judy Offut said according to the Sheboygan Press.

Victim: Barbara Olson, 78, was found in a pool of blood at her home last September

The
killer's account came in stark contrast with Barbeau's friend Nathan 
Paape's version of events, the Shaboygan Press reported.

Paape claimed the robbery and 
murder were Barbeau's idea and that he only hit Olson twice 
with a hammer because he feared his friend would turn on him.

Paape
thought Barbeau was joking about killing Olson, his lawyer said. But 
Barbeau said his friend never suggested he thought it was a joke.

He has pleaded not guilty but if convicted, he faces life in prison and a minimum 20 years in prison.

Olson's body was found in a pool of blood outside her home last September.

Once
the teens realized Olson was dead after the horrific attack, they 
attempted to drag her body to the car, leaving a trail on blood through 
the house, police said last September.

After failing to load Olson into the vehicle, they dumped her in the garage.

The boys then allegedly stole several items, including a purse, loose change and jewelry.

The
perpetrators then hopped into Olson's car and sped off. They eventually
dumped the vehicle in the parking lot of a local bowling alley and 
walked to a nearby eatery, where they shared a pizza.
