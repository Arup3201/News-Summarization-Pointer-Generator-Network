Actress Catherine Zeta-Jones has revealed how she used her own battle with bipolar disorder to prepare for her comeback big-screen role as a psychiatrist.

The Welsh actress stars as Dr Victoria Siebert in Steven Soderbergh’s thriller Side Effects, which opens on Friday.

And she told the film’s writer Scott Z. Burns that dealing with her own ‘demons’ meant she understood the role.

He said: ‘In our very first meeting, Catherine said to me, “I know a lot about this. I’ve been dealing with my own demons. I’ve spent some time in psychiatry.” ’

Miss Zeta-Jones, 43, attended the £770-a-day Silver Hill psychiatric clinic in Connecticut in 2011, where she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

Catherine Zeta-Jones was said to be nervous before performing Chicago onstage during the Oscars

She stars alongside Jude Law, Channing Tatum and Rooney Mara in the thriller which sees lead character Emily seek professional help for her anxiety issues.

Miss Zeta-Jones confessed to feeling anxiety of her own before marking her return to the limelight by reprising her role in Chicago for last weekend’s Oscars show.

She won a statuette for her role as Velma Kelly in the musical in 2002 and showed at 43 she still had razzle dazzle as she performed at last Sunday's awards in a figure-hugging nude lace lingerie bodice.

But the actress said she was nervous about 
singing live, ten years after the film's debut, and had prepared with a 
back up track just in case.

Earlier, Catherine appeared on the red carpet with husband Michael Douglas only a week after reports of a trial separation, which they have denied.
