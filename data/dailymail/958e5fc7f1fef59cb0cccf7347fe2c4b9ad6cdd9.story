A father has denied child cruelty charges after hospital tests on his three-year-old daughter showed she had ingested cannabis which had been 'left around the family home'.

At a previous hearing, the court heard that the 25-year-old father and 27-year-old mother - who cannot be named for legal reasons - had sent their two daughters to nursery with cannabis covered cookies in their lunch bag on May 23.

Today he pleaded not guilty to two charges of child cruelty and a third charge of possessing cannabis at Preston Crown Court.

Prosecutors at Preston Crown Court claimed that cannabis had been 'left around the family home' and ingested by the three-year-old girl. The man who cannot be named for legal reasons denies child cruelty

The mother, a nurse, was cautioned by police following an earlier hearing at Blackpool Magistrates' Court.

Lisa Worsley, prosecuting, said: 'Cannabis had been left around the family home, which had been ingested by the three-year-old child. There is CCTV evidence from the 23 May which shows the mother going into the nursery with a packet containing biscuits.'

The father, from Blackpool, Lancashire was released on bail and will face trial at Preston Crown Court on June 1 next year.

The court heard how the three-year-old and her two-year-old sister are still living with both parents.

The mother sat in the public gallery throughout the hearing.
