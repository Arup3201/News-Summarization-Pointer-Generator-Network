Being a member of a boy band is always a risky business but being a member of a tribute boy band is even more uncertain, as the 'Zayn Malik' of the UK's most popular One Direction tribute band found out last week. 

Jamie Searls, 25, from London, has been part of Only One Direction for the last three years and was preparing to go on tour with the group when the news broke last Wednesday.

But despite Zayn's departure from the group, Jamie has decided to carry on with the band in the traditional five-person line-up.

He told FEMAIL: 'I guess we’re all a little thoughtful. Nothing lasts forever but the last three years have been unforgettable for us all. 

'There’s been tears of joy, tears of pain, hatred, love but when it’s over, we will all leave with a set of friends and I for one, cherish them…. but don’t let them know that

'But Only One Direction will be gigging as normal as a five piece with Zayn in it - as long as people want to see us, I think we would be silly not to carry on. 

'It’s great to be able to do what you love for a living.'

Jamie joined Only One Direction in 2012 after being contacted by an old friend who had signed on to play the part of Harry Styles.

He said: 'I knew Henry Allan, who plays Harry Styles - we were in the West End Gospel Choir together. 

'He called me and said, "Hey, I’ve got a really fun opportunity. It’s for a 1D tribute," three years later, I’m still here.'

Since then the group have toured the UK, Ireland and the UAE. 

Jamie said: 'It’s been a rollercoaster for us.  It’s complete madness. 

'I entered this group thinking that it would be a little pocket money but it quickly became a full time job. 

'I was always sheepish about saying, I’m in a 1D tribute but truthfully, I’m very proud of the shows we put on.'

And while they may not be the real deal, it doesn't stopped teenage fans going crazy at shows and meet and greets. 

Jamie said: 'It can get a little crazy. In Dubai, we had to have security and had to be moved to avoid crushing crowds. 

'People remark on a passing resemblance [between Zayn and I]. But the truth is we’re not trying to be lookalike band. That would be a little token tribute. 

'No disrespect to the other tributes out there but we’re a theatre show, we like to bill ourselves as an experience.'

For the meantime, Jamie is going to continue performing as Zayn, but even if all the members of the real One Direction decide to throw in the towel, he has his own music to fall back on. 

On Tuesday he releases his debut solo single Doing Time on iTunes. 

Jamie said: 'I'm inspired by perseverance and learning from those around me. 

'There’s such talent coming out of the UK music scene and i’m keen to be a part of it.'
