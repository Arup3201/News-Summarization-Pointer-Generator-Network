A leading campaigner against child abuse says she blames herself for her teenage son's suicide, because she 'couldn't win' against school bullies.

Ayden Olsen, 14, was found dead at his family home on Thursday morning.

His heartbroken mother Shy Keenan, who campaigns for tougher controls on paedophiles alongside Sara Payne, claims her 'beautiful, kind-hearted' boy was 'bullied to death'.

Shy Keenan told a Sunday newspaper that she 'couldn't win' against Ayden's bullies

Today, Miss Keenan said she feels that she was unable to keep her son alive in the face of bullying at school.

She told the Sun on Sunday newspaper: 'I think that's why Ayden did it. I was a champion in his eyes and he thought, "If you can't make it stop, then no one can".'

Ayden was a pupil at Philip Morant School in Colchester, which his twin brother Jarrad also attends.

Miss Keenan said Ayden had been bullied since he was 11, shortly after starting at the school.

He was accused of assaulting a girl, but despite being cleared by police and social services, bullies continued to taunt him.

Miss Keenan told the newspaper that bullies called Ayden, whose father is Japanese-American, 'Asian Ugly' and he would pluck his eyebrows and beg her to let him have cosmetic surgery on his eyes to look less slanted.

She said: 'Ayden said the bullies, a gang of about six or seven, would attack him in "blind spots" where the CCTV cameras and teachers couldn't see. They would beat him, kick him, even throw flour bombs at him. Ayden would hide the bruises from us, but he couldn't hide his sadness.'

More recently, he was taunted after telling a friend he thought he might be gay and had a crush on another pupil.

Despite everything, Ayden wanted to stay at Philip Morant to be with his friends and was about to choose his GCSE subjects.

He had begun to self-harm and took an overdose in October, but told his father what he had done.

A doctor said Ayden would be referred to a psychologist but also told his parents that there was 'virtually nothing' for teenagers like him.

On Wednesday evening, Ayden told his mother that he loved her and went to bed about 9.30pm.

The next morning, Miss Keenan's husband Tim found Ayden dead in his bedroom. She attemped CPR, but it was too late.

She said: 'He was just lying there, his lips blue, blood coming out of his mouth.'

'Then I sat there hugging him and rocking him like I did when he was a baby. I kept thinking, "If I scream loud enough, I can scream it away". I cannot bear to think that I will never laugh with him again, never kiss him, never see him.'

Miss Keenan revealed the news of her son's death on Twitter on Thursday, writing: ‘Shy and Tim’s beloved son Ayden died today age 14 – no further update at this time...’

A picture of Ayden, with his 
name and dates of birth and death, was used as a backdrop to her profile on the social networking site 
with the words ‘bullied to death’ written under each photograph.

Along with the many messages of 
condolence she received, Miss Keenan also posted links to the website of
the charity Bullying UK.

Well-wishers posted dozens of tributes to the teenager and messages of support for Miss Keenan.

Mrs Payne, whose eight-year-old 
daughter Sarah was murdered by paedophile Roy Whiting in 2000, wrote on 
Twitter: ‘ My darling our hearts break with yours,’ and ‘beautiful kind 
hearted boy with a wonderful soul’.

Actress Brooke Kinsella, who has 
campaigned for a clampdown on knife crime after the murder of her 
brother Ben, tweeted: ‘I am so sorry Shy. I don’t know what to say apart
from I am thinking of you and my heart breaks for you XXXX.’ 

School friend Megan Grinham posted: 
‘RIP to the most wonderful boy Ayden. At dancing, he always made us 
laugh. Praying for his family.’

Ayden’s friends condemned bullying in
tributes on Twitter. One, Jessica Manning posted: ‘RIP Ayden’ and 
retweeted a message from Millie Bentley, which said: ‘Maybe now all the 
fowl mouthed [sic] children in lower school will realise that everything
you say to someone will stick with them & impact them.’

A pupil’s mother posted a message to 
Miss Keenan, saying: ‘My daughter was friends with your son and came 
home devastated yesterday. He used to make her laugh every day, xx.’

Miss Keenan, 49, exposed her own stepfather as a child abuser. She was 
repeatedly raped by him from the age of four and sold to gangs of other 
paedophiles for just £15.

But, after suffering years of torment
which drove her to attempt suicide, she recorded Stanley Claridge 
incriminating himself on a hidden camera.

It led to him being jailed for 15 
years in 2002 for a string of sex attacks on her, other girls and a boy 
dating back to the 1970s.

She has since campaigned to keep 
Britain’s streets safe for children, dedicated herself to helping 
victims of child abuse and spoken out on child protection issues.

In her autobiography, Broken, she 
told how she sometimes almost died from the violence of the sexual abuse
she suffered. As a teenager, she was talked down from a Liverpool tower
block clutching a suicide note.

A flurry of tributes were sent to the grieving mother, who is a high profile child abuse campaigner, and posted a picture of him on her Twitter page

She went on to launch the sex abuse 
victims’ support group Phoenix Survivors, named after the police 
operation which led to her stepfather’s imprisonment.

She has criticised soft sentences for
child abusers and called for more information about where paedophiles 
live to be available to the public.

A spokesman for Philip Morant School 
and Essex County Council said: ‘Our thoughts and prayers are with 
[Ayden’s] family during this difficult time. Ayden was a much-loved, 
talented pupil who bought joy to the school.

‘The school community is incredibly 
saddened by his loss and we ask that people respect the privacy of his 
family and friends during these devastating circumstances.

‘Essex County Council is working with
the school to provide counselling to students and staff. We would urge 
any student who feels overwhelmed, confused or upset to talk to someone 
about their feelings and seek support.

‘It is a statutory requirement for 
all schools to have an anti-bullying policy and pupils are aware of 
where they can go for support and advice.

‘If any pupil is being bullied, or is
aware of bullying taking place, we would urge them to tell a friend, 
trusted adult or family member so that appropriate action can be 
taken.’ 

An Essex Police spokesman confirmed 
that the teenager’s death was not being treated as suspicious. The 
coroner has been informed.
