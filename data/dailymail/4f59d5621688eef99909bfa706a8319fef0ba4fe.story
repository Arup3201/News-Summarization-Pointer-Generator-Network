Part-time workers who have to pay for five days' weekday service lose out heavily under the current inflexible system

New 'flexible' smart cards that allow rail season ticket holders to pay only for the journeys they actually make are to be trialled next year, Rail Minister Norman Baker announced today.

The new scheme - welcomed by consumer groups - will be similar to the 'Oyster' card system used on London Underground which deducts cash from a smart electronic swipe-card and charges users only for the trains they use.

Part-time workers who have to pay for five days' weekday service yet work only three lose out heavily under the current inflexible system, as do those who have to work weekends.

The scheme could also include discounted tickets for those travelling in the slightly quieter periods at either end of the rush hour called the 'shoulder peak'.

The aim is to make season fares more equitable and flexible and 'give commuters a better deal on the railways' said Mr Baker.

He said: 'Millions of people no longer work traditional 9 to 5. Flexible ticketing must reflect that. It will give passengers a better deal by reducing the money they spend on fares and will spread demand across the network by encouraging them to take less busy services'.

It is one of a range of options to 'modernise' fares as part of the Government's Fares and Ticketing Review. The full report is to be published soon.

The Department for Transport will run a competition next year to select a train operator to run a pilot on a busy commuter route into London.

Lib Dem Rail Minister Mr Baker said a more flexible approach using 'smart technology' was vital: 'Part-time workers and those who sometimes work from home have long complained they have to pay the full price for season tickets even though they do not get the full benefit.

'Under this pilot we will look at how we can give them a better deal and also reward those commuters who avoid the busiest rush hour services.'

Anthony Smith, chief executive of consumer champion Passenger Focus welcomed the announcement.

Their own research showed that fewer than six out of ten weekday commuters (57 per cent) did so for all five days. And many worked weekends: 'We need a season ticket that is flexible with changing working patterns.'

The Department of Transport said it had committed Â£45m to rolling out 'smart ticketing' across the South East .
