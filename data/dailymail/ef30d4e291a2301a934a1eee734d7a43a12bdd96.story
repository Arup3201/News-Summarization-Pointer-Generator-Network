Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is weighing up a move for AC Milan midfielder Nigel de Jong.

United are determined to add one more midfielder to their squad this summer following the capture of Ander Herrera, with Van Gaal feeling that his new side requires bite and steel in the central acres to complement the composure of players such as Michael Carrick and Tom Cleverley.

Arturo Vidal of Juventus is the dream solution and Sportsmail revealed on Friday that United have made tentative enquiries over the possible signing of the Chilean midfielder.

Target? AC Milan midfielder and former Manchester City player Nigel de Jong could be on his way to Old Trafford

Possibility: Van Gaal is determined to add another midfielder to his Manchester United side

Maybe: De Jong could complement the composure of players such as Michael Carrick and Tom Cleverley

Born: Amsterdam, Holland, Nov 30 1984

2002-2006: Ajax (96 apps, 9 gls)

2006-2009: Hamburger SV (66 apps, 3 gls)

2009-2012: Manchester City (104 apps, 1 gl)

2012-NOW: AC Milan (45 apps, 3 gls)

However, the Italian side have offered little encouragement and United recognise it may be unfeasible to pull off a move this summer.

Nevertheless, United are hopeful the player may put pressure on his employers and they will be prepared to test the water with a bid exceeding £30million in the coming weeks.

United have also been put off by Juventus' asking price for Frenchman Paul Pogba, with the former United academy star commanding a fee in the region of £55m this summer.

Van Gaal has been impressed by former Manchester City star De Jong's dynamic and disciplined showings at the World Cup for Holland and he is seen as a pragmatic fit with Premier League experience.

The 29-year-old would be available for around £9m and he could emerge as an alternative if United are unable to land Vidal.

Roma's Kevin Strootman also remains on United's radar but any move could be delayed until next summer as he recovers from a long-term cruciate knee injury.
