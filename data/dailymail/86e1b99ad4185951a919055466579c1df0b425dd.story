A 20-year-old gunman who stormed a suburban Atlanta elementary school armed with an AK-47 today may have slipped past the school's locked doors by following a staff member, it was revealed this evening.

Police say Michael Brandon Hill took a secretary in the front office hostage and demanded she call an Atlanta TV station, saying that he wanted camera crews to 'start filming at police die.'

Officers arriving at Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy in Decatur, Georgia, on Tuesday afternoon exchanged gunfire with Hill. Police say the suspect fired off a half dozen rounds at officers.

The gunman later surrendered. No one was injured in the frightening incident and the school's 870 students were evacuated to a nearby Wal-Mart, where they were reunited with their frantic parents.

Arrested: Michael Brandon Hill, 20, is in police custody after he surrendered following an armed standoff with police

Police SWAT teams and bomb squads feared that Hill planted bombs in his car in 
the parking lot of the school. They detonated a controlled blast in the 
trunk of the car and evacuated the neighborhood around his nearby house 
before making entry to search for more weapons and bombs.

The shooting resulted in no injuries, but nonetheless recalled the terrifying massacre last December at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in which a lone gunman with an assault rifle killed 20 students and six teachers before taking his own life.

WSB-TV reports that the school has a buzzer system that limits access to outsiders, but that that Hill may have slipped in behind a staff member who was walking into the building.

GBI Director Vernon Keenan said the incident was terrifying for parents and students alike, but that the incident could havee ended much, much worse.

'It takes a lot of resources to handle something like this,' Mr Keenan told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 'We were dern lucky we didn’t have anyone killed in the school.'

The students had to be evacuated through the back of the elementary school because police were concerned that the gunman's car could be rigged to explode and kill students if they fled through the front exit. 

Firefighters cut a hole in fencing at the back of the school property that students had to run through to escape the school.

From there, they were taken by bus to a Wal-Mart parking lot about two miles away.

According to ABC News,
a woman named Antoinette who works in the school office said that the 
lone male gunman wanted TV crews at the scene so that he could be filmed
shooting police.

She said that the gunman told her to specifically call WSB-TV.

Police evacuated the neighborhood around the gunman's house as they searched his home for explosives and other weapons

Heavily-armed police patrolled the neighborhood around the school as they searched for explosives that they feared suspect Michael Brandon Hill may have hidden

Chaos: The evacuation of the school left dozens of parents and students frantically searching for each other in the parking lot of a nearby Wal-Mart

The journalists on the other end of the call could hear shots being fired.

The school in question is an Atlanta-area elementary charter school that ranges from pre-kindergarten to fifth grade.

Police had strung yellow tape up blocking intersections near the school while children waited to be taken to Wal-Mart.

The
school has about 870 children enrolled. The academy is named after 
McNair, an astronaut who died when the space shuttle Challenger exploded
on January 28, 1986, according to the school's website.

Waiting for word: Concerned parents lined up outside the Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learning Academy school near Atlanta on Tuesday afternoon when they heard about the shooting

Taking every precaution: Police and SWAT teams were on the scene but began to disperse after the shooter was in custody

Getting out safe: The shooter has been taken into custody and no one was injured at the scene

Staying safe: Police huddled children to a nearby field after the shooter was apprehended

On patrol: Some units remained on the scene to make sure no explosives were left in the school

Residential: The school is located in a less busy suburb of Atlanta, with homes surrounding it

Worried: The elementary school shooting was the first since the massacre at Sandy Hook in December
