Misfiring Inter Milan forward Lukas Podolski has moved to defend himself as he reacted angrily to critics of his recent performances in Serie A, following a loan switch from Arsenal in January.

The Germany international has failed to score in his 11 appearances so far for the Nerazzurri and has come under intense scrutiny from the Italian press, with some outlets even branding him as the worst signing of the season.  

But Podolski feels that these attacks are unfair and counter productive to him rediscovering his form. 'People keep bringing up how the Italian media looks at me,' he said, 'What can I do about it? Should I just dig myself into the ground and give up playing football?'

While Podolski might be struggling at club level, his international career has suffered no such dip. The 29-year-old came off the bench to score his 48th goal for Germany, a dramatic late equaliser in their 2-2 draw with Australia on Wednesday.  

That goal has now placed Podolski third in his country's all-time leading scoring charts and he is keen to carry on being part of the international set-up.    

'I have always been part of the team and I hope this will continue to be the case,' he said.

'I always enjoy being with the national team and always give my all in training to show the coach what I can do. It's then up to him to make a decision.'
