It is a time-honored tradition - but Sasha and Malia would rather have been anywhere else than having to watch their dad crack lame jokes as he pardoned the National Thanksgiving Turkey.

Shuffling awkwardly and rolling their eyes like any teenage girls would while their father laughed at his own - mildly controversial funnies- Malia and Sasha made no attempt to appear anything other than bored stiff.

Indeed, after President Obama had pardoned four-month-old, 49-pound Cheese, he asked Malia if she wanted to pet the turkey.

'Nah', she replied without even smiling, summing up her and her sister's amusing indifference to the bizarre annual ceremony.

Cracking asides about his recent hotly contested executive action on immigration, Obama's shtick left his daughters rigid and disinterested, despite the press corp laughing heartily at the president's jokes.

No doubt the girls have heard it all before from their dad but as he relished in his solemn authority to 'spare the lives of two turkeys, Mac and Cheese', both their eyes veered from staring at the floor in embarrassment to barely concealed yawns.

Obviously, like all dads, the president appeared oblivious, smiling and beaming throughout the ritual as he condemned the other turkey, Mac to its sad fate.

'Let’s face it, if you’re a turkey and you’re named after a side dish, your chances of escaping Thanksgiving dinner are pretty low!' said Obama.

Could we BE anymore bored? The president obviously enjoys the annual Thanksgiving turkey pardon, but his daughters looked like they would rather be anywhere else

Why are you all laughing? He isn't funny!: President Obama honored the gobbler during a traditional pardoning ceremony at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, while Sasha and Malia did their best to laugh at his jokes

What did we do to deserve this? The president jostled with the assembled press corp and made jokes about his recent executive action on immigration. His daughters tried not to fall asleep it seemed through sheer boredom

Wrap it up dad! Malia almost wills her dad to finish with her eyes while Sasha has a look that says, 'Yup, have heard this all before'

Oh god here he goes: Malia looks to Sasha to see if she is as into the Thanksgiving turkey pardon ceremony as their dad is. She is not

Is it over? Come on dad!: The President's daughters dressed in festive colors as they stood by for the turkey pardoning ceremony

Enthusiasm for tradition: The National Thanksgiving Turkey has been announced - a dashing four-month-old bird by the name of Cheese

Bored stiff? However, the two teenage girls appeared particularly underwhelmed by the affair

Is he finished? The girls appear to smile during the ceremony which took place at the White House today 

Cheese - who will be rehomed at a country estate in Virginia instead of being eaten for dinner - was described as a 'grand champion' weighing 49lbs. 

His alluring gobble was defined as 'loud' and 'romantic' with a 'country ring.'

This year the White House asked Twitter users to help decide which bird should receive the official pardon.

Cheese was vying against his buddy, Mac. But his larger size and head-turning squawk saw him claim victory.

Although only one bird was pardoned, both will be saved from the roasting tray and rehomed at Morven Park, the former home of a Virginia governor.

Obama joked that he had spared Mac and Cheese 'from a terrible and delicious fate.'

U.S. presidents have been pardoning turkeys since the 1800s as part of the country's national Thanksgiving holiday. 

The vote was extended to the public in 2012.  

Continuing a family tradition, Gary Cooper, the chairman of the National Turkey Federation, is responsible for raising the presidential turkey flock each year.

Grand occasion: President Obama is flanked by his daughters Sasha (far right) and Malia (right) while Cheese's breeder, National Turkey Federation Chairman Gary Cooper (second left) hold the bird tight 

His brother previously raised one for the Clintons in 1996. 

This time around Cooper began raising 66 birds at his farm in Oakwood, Ohio, in July with his son Cole.

The father-son team then selected two of their finest specimens - based on  coloring, size and temperament - and drove them to Washington D.C.this week.

He selected a hotel that would get them in the mood for a meeting with the President and booked a $350 room at the Willard InterContinental.

The custom-suite came complete with a flat screen TV, minibar and wood shaving pit to scratch around in.

However, it was a little tricky to keep the birds' behavior in check.

'Last night, they were trying to order room service,' Cooper joked. He made sure he was on hand throughout the night by booking an adjoining room. 

The White House tallied votes on Twitter until 1pm and the President announced that Cheese had been named the National Thanksgiving Turkey later Wednesday afternoon.

'It's kind of like Miss Universe, you know. We've got the winner and the first runner-up,' Cooper told USA Today. 

Following the presidential pardon ceremony, the 21-week-old turkeys will join Caramel, last year's winner, to see out the rest their days.

Commercially bred turkeys - more than double the weight of those in the wild - are known to have short lifespans as their large size takes a toll on their internal organs.

Ruffled: Cheese and his competitor Mac traveled nine hours on Monday by car from their home in Ohio to their lavish $350 custom-suite at the Willard InterContinental, complete with a flat screen TV, mini bar and wood shaving pit

Big moment: But the journey wasn't in vain - on Wednesday the gobblers met President Obama to battle it out for the title of National Thanksgiving Turkey - meaning the more beauty sleep they got the better

Luxurious: An image of the room the White House turkeys were staying in - the bill was footed by the National Turkey Federation

Rock and roll behavior: Apparently the turkeys were trying to order room service as they pecked around their luxury residence
