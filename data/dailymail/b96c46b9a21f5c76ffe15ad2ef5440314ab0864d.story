Evidence: Andy Coulson admitted today he listened to David Blunkett's hacked voicemails but 'didn't know it was illegal'

Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson today admitted he listened to hacked voicemails left by MP David Blunkett  where he told his married lover she was 'breaking his heart'.

In the messages the former Home Secretary was said to 
have repeatedly declared his love for Kimberley Fortier, as she tried to
 break off their affair in July 2004.

Coulson
 told the Old Bailey hacking trial today he was played extracts of the 
messages in his office but 'at that stage, I didn't know it was 
illegal'.

In some, Mr Blunkett asked her not to end their 
relationship, which is thought to have begun in 2001.

In
 one recording the Labour politician says: ‘You are breaking my heart.’ 
In others, he tells her that he ‘yearns’ and ‘longs’ for 
her.

The Old Bailey heard previously police investigating phone hacking at the tabloid discovered 330 messages from Mr Blunkett and associates hidden in a News of the World safe.

Coulson
 said today he was 'shocked' when his chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck 
first told him about the hacked messages, while he was on holiday in 
Italy.

'Neville told me he 
had a tip that David Blunkett was having an affair with Kimberly 
Fortier. He said that he believed the story was true because he heard 
some voicemails.

'I was 
shocked because he told me he had heard some voicemail messages. I was 
shocked that he was telling me this as well because it was in relation 
to David Blunkett, the Home Secretary.

'I was quite angry about it. I used 
reasonably colourful language, words to the effect "What in earth do you
 think you're doing".'

Ex-editor: Andy Coulson told the court that the News of the World was a competitive environment and that he had become 'paranoid' about leaks of stories to rivals.

'He believed it was in the public interest and he wanted to play me some voicemails to establish that to effectively demonstrate that', he said.

'I remember a few things, I remember a message where David Blunkett was effectively declaring his love and also saying he had considered taking the relationship public.

'I remember a phrase along the lines of 'I'm going to blow this apart', a mention of a terrorism arrest, and also I have in my mind a reference made to GCHQ. 

'Neville believed the relationship had been going on for three years', said Coulson.

'And
 he also made mentioned of the possibility that there might be an issue 
of the paternity of one of Kimberly Fortier's children'.

Coulson said the more he listened, the more he started to think there was 'some public interest justification' in the story but he wanted time to think about it.

Asked where he thought the reporter had got the vociemail by his lawyer Timothy Langdale QC, Coulson said: 'The conversation did not go into detail about that. If I made an assumption, it was Neville had done this himself. It was all coming from Neville.'

He added: 'I remained shocked - this was the first and only time a voicemail had been played to me.'

Later,
 Coulson said he started to justify pursuing the story on the basis that
 Mr Blunkett was 'distracted' by the affair and he was sharing sensitive
 information.

He said he 
took legal advice about the privacy aspect of the story. He concluded 
the story still needed to be stood up but decided that Mr Blunkett was 
more likely to do so if the NotW did not name his lover.

Heartbreak: In the messages, Mr Blunkett was 
said to have repeatedly declared his love for Ms Fortier as she tried to end their affair

He said: 'I thought, rightly or 
wrongly, if I suggested to David Blunkett that I would not name Kimberly
 Fortier, he would be more likely to confirm the story.'

Coulson told the court that, looking back, he 'should not have handled the story the way I did'.

Coulson authorised his staff to check 
if Mr Blunkett met his lover when they suspected he would, as he still 
felt the story needed 'standing up'.

He
 eventually resolved to speak to Mr Blunkett himself to confirm the 
affair, and ran the story without her name because he was concerned 
about breaching her privacy. 

He confronted Mr Blunkett about 
the fling before the story was printed.

In a tape of a meeting played to
 the jury, Coulson said: ‘People know about this affair. I’m not saying 
it’s an open secret, but people are aware of it.’

Paranoia over leaks rather than phone hacking at the News of the World prompted Andy Coulson to send an email ordering 'Do his phone', jurors have heard.

The former editor denied the instruction to a colleague had anything to do with hacking the voicemails of celebrity Calum Best, son of footballer George Best.

Coulson said an atmosphere of suspicion around a member of NotW staff led to the decision to inspect his phone billing data.

He told the Old Bailey: 'I was quite resistant to the idea of anybody working for me leaking stories but there was a growing body of evidence that was being put forward by some other people on the paper and in the end - reluctantly - I approved the request for billing data in relation to (the member of staff).'

He told jurors he was in no doubt that the email he sent was not an 'instruction to anybody to hack anybody's phone'.

The risk of stories being published elsewhere was greater on a Sunday newspaper than a daily and that led to 'paranoia' over leaks.

But he said: 'It was very destructive. It was all too much time and too much effort.'

In the event, there was no evidence to support the suspicions surrounding the reporter in question, the court heard.

Mr Blunkett refused to
 confirm or deny it as his private life was ‘not fair game’.

Coulson
 said today he regretted not telling Mr Blunkett the affair story had
 come from phone hacking because that would be brought it 'to a head'.

'At this distance, I shouldn't have handled the story in this way', he said.

'I should have stuck to my first instinct.

'It would have become apparent very quickly what I was laying out was the product of an illegal act.'

In the confrontation with Mr Blunkett, Coulson repeatedly refused to reveal how he knows about the affair.

Coulson told the court today: 'At least I would be able to argue my case.

'At that stage, I didn't know it was illegal and I felt it was possibly justified.

'It could have ended in legal action, it could have ended in police action.

'I sincerely wish I had followed that course of action at that point.'

On his regret over the Blunkett story, Coulson said: 'It is easy to say now that what we were laying out in front of him was the product of an illegal act.

'My view is that I kind of wish I had. It would have brought the whole thing to a head and I would have at least been able to argue my point.

'I did not know it was illegal. How it would have ended I have no idea. It could have ended in legal action. It could have ended in police action. I sincerely wish I had followed that course of action at that moment.

Coulson
 quit as editor of the News of the World in January 2007 after the 
convictions of Royal editor Clive Goodman and private detective Glenn 
Mulcaire for phone hacking.

Six
 months later, he was appointed director of communications and planning 
for the Conservative Party, retaining the post when David Cameron became
 Prime Minister.

However, he was forced to resign over hacking again in January 2011, as the police investigation got under way.

Coulson
 is accused with former News International chief executive Rebekah 
Brooks, 45, and former News of the World managing editor Stuart Kuttner,
 74, of a six-year phone hacking campaign.

Brooks, Coulson and Clive Goodman are also accused of corrupting public officials.

News
 International head of security Mark Hanna, 51, Brooks, her husband 
Charlie, 51, and PA Cheryl Carter, 50, are accused of organising a 
cover-up when Brooks knew she was about to be arrested.

The trial continues.
