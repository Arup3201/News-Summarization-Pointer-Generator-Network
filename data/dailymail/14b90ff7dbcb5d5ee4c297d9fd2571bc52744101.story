Floyd Mayweather is the blueprint for boxers intent on becoming a world champion.

But Amir Khan will soon be the one signposting the path to superstardom, starting with a command performance against Devon Alexander in Las Vegas on Saturday.

So says Khan’s trainer.

Virgil Hunter believes welterweight Khan is on the brink of superseding Mayweather, explaining: ‘Amir is one of our elite boxers. He has just two more levels to ascend.

‘The first is to prove that he is on the way to greatness. I expect him to do that against Alexander.

‘The second is to establish himself as truly great.’

The unspoken conclusion to the equation is that Khan can take that final step by becoming the man who puts an end to Mayweather’s unbeaten record.

Yet even if that fight still fails to materialise, Hunter expects Khan to become the planet's No 1 fighting man.

To begin validating that lofty prediction, he rationalises the three defeats in Khan’s career as simply unfortunate, saying: ‘No-one beats Amir. They just get a little lucky.’

Here’s how:

On Breidis Prescott, Hunter said: 'Amir should never have been thrown into that fight. Too early. He was a boy against a man and ran onto a big punch.'

On Lamont Peterson, Hunter insisted: 'That was a fight with it’s own issues (including the question of drugs). Remember the officiating. Even after that odd deduction of two points he should have been given the decision.'

And on Danny Garcia, Hunter explained: 'Amir was giving him a shellacking until he got careless and was caught by one huge shot.’

So what about that much derided Khan chin? 

‘The problem when he went down was that his positioning was all over the place and he was too carried away with throwing big punches of his own.’

Khan should have fought Alexander a year ago, before the American lost his world title which has ended up in the possession of another Brit, Khan’s would-be rival Kell Brook.‘

Yet Hunter welcomes the year of ring inactivity during Khan’s vain wait for a Mayweather fight.

He says: ‘I don’t believe in ring rustiness as long as the boxer keeps working in the gym. In fact the delay has given us a chance to reconstruct Amir the way he should have been built in the first place.’

Hunter has gone through a similar period with his first outstanding prodigy, Andre Ward, who was rated the third best pound-for-pound fighter in the world before injury and a legal dispute rendered him fight-idle. Hunter expects Ward to return to world title action soon, even greater.

‘If you are going to be the dominant fighter in your division,’ says Hunter, ‘you should win fights which everyone expects to be difficult – easily.

‘Andre did that before and will do so again. Mayweather does it. Amir will do it against Alexander. Both he and Andre have their best years ahead of them. Amir is already a man to be reckoned with.

Khan is confident of beating Alexander and hopes to take on unbeaten Floyd Mayweather next year

Khan also trained in the ring at the Roy Jones Jnr gym in preparation for the clash with Alexander

‘He has all the physical attributes for greatness. Now, at 28, married and with his first child he has gained in maturity. The mentality for greatness is coming.

‘Mayweather has proved that to be recognised as the best and to be the highest earner you don’t have to go out to entertain the fans.’

And to those back in England who will raise eyebrows at this lavish praise for Khan, Hunter draws upon a football analogy: ‘In soccer you don’t have to be the one who kicks the ball hardest and furthest. People admire the player with the most skill, the one who does things with the ball that others cannot.

‘In boxing, that person now is Mayweather. Soon it can be Khan.'

As the burden of expectation builds on Khan’s shoulders, so the bar keeps being raised.

Hunter expects him to hurdle that barrier, in style, saying: ‘Amir has found his own identity now. He has established clearly in is mind who he wants to be. The best.’

*Khan v Alexander will be televised live on Sky Sports late this Saturday night
