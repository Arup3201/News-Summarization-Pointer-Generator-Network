Bob Tur, the famous news helicopter pilot who filmed a mob beating driver Reginald Denny during the LA Riots, and the O.J. Simpson car chase, has started treatment to become a woman.

The 53-year-old from Santa Monica, who has two children, says that once the process is complete in November 'Bob must die' to make way for Zoey.

Tur chose to publicly announce the transformation because she was 'done hiding', adding that in the past five years she had started to push family and friends away and had suffered from body dysmorphic disorder.

Family and friends have been supportive of the Tur's decision, although she added that for some it felt like grieving as they prepared to say goodbye to Bob.

'For the most part, people didn’t know. They were in a state of shock initially,' she told CBS Los Angeles.

'My kids were in a state of shock. And they have been going through this mourning process. Bob Tur has got to die. And that’s going to happen within the next three or four months.'

Going through the transitional period 
'has not been easy' Tur said, adding she had been worried how it would 
affect her children including daughter, Katy, who is a reporter on NBC Nightly News.

Tur, who married at age 23 and has dated Carrie Fisher, is currently in the early stages of aggressive hormone replacement therapy, which changes body hair and starts the growth of breasts.

She says her body is catching up with her mind, which has been female since birth.

'There have been incredible changes that happen physically and mentally. Mental changes have already happened, Tur said. 'I’m thinking the same way a woman would think.'

The pilot, who has more than 10,000 flying hours over war zones and riots, says the hormone therapy has affected the way she flies, adding that her thought pattern has become more analytical than instinctive.

Tur, who says many transgender people pick hyper masculine jobs such as pilots or servicemen,  will have surgery to make her face more feminine and to have sexual reassignment surgery.

In an interview with TMZ she said:'Transgender people really are misunderstood. It's not what you think'.

The pilot says she has had a female brain since birth, but struggled to come to terms with who she is.

Action: The pilot was also there to get footage of OJ Simpson's car chase in June 1994

'Initially you really don't know what to make of it. It just got very depressing because you don't recognize your image in the mirror.'

Tur is charting the transformation at facebook.com/robert.tur to raise awareness and acceptance.

'It’s a genetic disorder that happens in utero. Nobody knows exactly why, but you’re born with a female or feminized brain,' she said.

'If you don’t really know who you are. You think you’re a woman, but you’re a man.'

Transformation: When the course of hormone therapy ends later this year, Bob Tur will be known as Zoey

She decided to start treatment after starting to withdraw from the world over the past five years and suffering from depression.

But since starting her transformation into Zoey, Tur says her life has improved massively.

'Now that my brain is getting the right hormones… I had no idea that life was like this ... For the first time, I’m truly happy,' she said.
