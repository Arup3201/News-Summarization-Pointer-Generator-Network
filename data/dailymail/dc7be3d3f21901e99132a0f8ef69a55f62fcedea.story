Three men have been arrested on suspicion of supplying the dangerous batch of 'Superman' ecstasy pills - as the drug claims its fourth life.

Police confirmed they detained a 19-year-old man, a 20-year-old man and a 26-year-old man last night on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of controlled drugs.

All three men are from Ipswich, Suffolk, and remain in police custody at Martlesham Police Investigation Centre awaiting questioning.

Four deaths have so far been linked to the rogue batch - three of which were all in Suffolk. 

The first victim, 22-year-old Lithuanian factory worker Justas Ropas, who was also known as Justin, collapsed and died at his home in Ipswich on Christmas Eve.

While John Hocking, 20, from Rendlesham, Suffolk, Gediminas Kulokas, 24, from Ipswich, and Daniel Bagnall, 27, from Telford in Shropshire, died within hours of each other on New Year's Day. 

All are believed to have taken one or more of a deadly batch of triangular red pills embossed with the Superman ‘S’ logo. 

It comes as the girlfriend of one of the victims said anyone who takes the drug must have a 'death wish'. 

Natasha Mumby tried desperately to resuscitate her partner, Gediminas Kulokas, who died at their home in the county following a night of celebrations.

Another man – a friend of the couple who is also believed to have taken pills from a batch of ecstasy tablets marked with a ‘Superman’ logo – remained in hospital last night. 

Suffolk Police yesterday took the unprecedented move of offering an amnesty to anyone who hands in the tablets, as they desperately attempt to get them off the streets and trace the dealers.

Heartbroken Miss Mumby, 30, said last night that her boyfriend, a labourer originally from Lithuania, was not a regular drug user.

He had stayed up late partying at their flat to celebrate his 24th birthday and New Year’s Eve.

She said: ‘I went to bed at 2am and woke up a few times because him and his friend were making a bit of noise. I had no idea that they had been taking drugs.

‘Every time I got up to tell them to keep quiet, they were looking the worse for wear. His friend popped out and when I checked on Gediminas, he was breathing in a funny way. I propped him up and went back to bed.

‘I then came back in the lounge because he was not making the breathing noise any more.’

She dialled 999 at around 9.40am on New Year’s Day and took advice over the phone on how to try to resuscitate her boyfriend.

A tearful Miss Mumby, a recruitment agency manager, said: ‘Then the ambulances and the helicopter came along. They tried and tried to save him. At one point they got his heartbeat back and then it went again.’ She added: ‘He was in good health, went to the gym and ate well. He was a wonderful person who was always helping people.’

Mr Kulokas was pronounced dead at 10.10am. His girlfriend said she wanted his story to serve as a warning to others to avoid drugs.

‘If anyone else was thinking of taking them, I would say, “If you have got that pill in your hand, you either live or die”,’ she said.

‘Drugs are a death wish. Just don’t do it, because you will hurt yourself, your family and your friends. Life is just too short.’ 

Justas Ropas, also known as Justin, worked in a DVD factory in the Suffolk town and was found dead on Decemeber 24

Suffolk Police said the drugs are similar to some found in the Netherlands which contained a very high amount of the substance PMMA. This gives the pills a delayed effect and users often overdose accidentally because they think the drug is not working, leading to a fatal rise in body temperature.

Labourer Mr Hocking died around three hours before Mr Kulokas at his home 13 miles away.

Mr Bagnall, the only victim outside Ipswich and the surrounding area, was found dead at a house in Telford at 1.45pm on New Year’s Day. It is believed he had taken an ecstasy tablet from the same batch as the men in Suffolk.

Ipswich Conservative MP Ben Gummer said last night: ‘It’s very sad indeed ... if you are buying drugs you are never going to be sure about where they come from.’  

Police believe the men, who were all in their twenties, may have been involved with the drug after emergency services were called to three addresses across Ipswich in the space of one week (pictured)

A spokesman for Suffolk Police said this is the first time they have come across pills matching this description.

The force has drawn a link between these drugs and dangerous pills with a similar appearance which were in circulation in the Netherlands last month.

Those tablets had a large concentration of PMMA, which acts more slowly than MDMA, the main component of ecstasy. This causes people to take more pills because they think they are not working.

PMMA can cause high body temperature and an increased heart rate.

There are also concerns the pills could be linked to 120,000 similar ones seized in Ireland last month. 

Police say the drugs may also be in a round shape with the 'S' Superman logo embossed on them (pictured)

Chief Inspector Steve Denham said: 'As well as it being illegal to sell and buy drugs, it can also be very dangerous as we have sadly seen with these tragic deaths.

'We would urge everyone not to be tempted to take illegal drugs - you don't know where they have come from, what they are made up of, or how your body will react to them.

'If you have been offered drugs in the Ipswich area over the past few weeks, in particular ecstasy, we'd urge you to contact us with any information so that we can find those responsible and remove these dangerous drugs from the streets.'
