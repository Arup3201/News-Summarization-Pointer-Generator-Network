A majority of Americans believe in the devil, especially Republicans, blacks and women, a new poll has found. 

The survey by YouGov found that 57 percent of respondents believe that the devil exists, including 72 percent of African Americans, 65 percent of Republicans and and 61 percent of women. 

There aren't as many believers among the better-educated respondents.

Sixty-three percent of people with a high school education said they believe in the evil spirit compared to 48 percent of college graduates. 

Regionally, most believers live in the South. Sixty-four percent of Southerners fear Satan compared to 56 percent in the Midwest, 52 percent in the West and 48 percent in the Northeast.

Four in 10 people believe that people are occasionally possessed by the devil, with 46 percent believing in the power of exorcism. Only one in 10 said Satan never possesses humans.

Religion clearly plays a big role in whether people believe in evil spirits. 

Most believers (86 percent) affiliate with Christianity, over Catholicism (66 percent), Judaism (17 percent), and Islam (25 percent).

The Washington Examiner first reported on the YouGov poll, which surveyed 1,000 people.
