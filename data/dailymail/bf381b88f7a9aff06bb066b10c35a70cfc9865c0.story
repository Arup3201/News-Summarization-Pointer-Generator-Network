A 151-year-old house that was the first in the world to be lit using hydroelectricity is once again harnessing the power of water to light the property.

Cragside, in Northumberland, was built by Lord Armstrong in 1863 and he used lakes on the estate to generate electricity through a turbine.

A 56ft (17-metre) Archimedes screw has now been installed which will use water to produce enough energy to light the 350 bulbs in the house.

Geordie actor Robson Green today turned on the screw at the National Trust property and launched the hydropower project.

Property curator Andrew
 Sawyer said: ‘It is a very visual 
demonstration of the way hydro power works, an almost sculptural sight 
in the landscape.

‘Lord
 Armstrong was an exceptional man with an ingenious mind and the 
prospect of bringing his vision for Cragside into the 21st century is a 
dream come true.

‘Hydroelectricity
 is the world's most widely used form of renewable energy, so we are 
looking forward to sharing this very special part of its heritage.’

As water passes through the 
spiral blades it causes the screw to turn, thereby harnessing the energy
 of falling water. The energy is then converted into electricity using a
 generator.

Sarah Pemberton,
 head of conservation for Yorkshire and the North East at the National 
Trust, said: ‘The hydro-turbine is a great example of the innovative 
methods we are using to achieve the highest possible standards of 
sustainability.

‘The technology is easy to maintain due to the simple mechanics, and because it works at low speed, it's possible for fish to pass through the turbine unharmed.

‘The best thing about the screw is that it's visible and we hope this will add to people's understanding of why Cragside is so special.

'Visitors will be able to view the technology from the lake side.’

The Grade 1 listed building reopened in 2007 after a total refurbishment and is surrounded by one of Europe's largest rock gardens.

Once described as a 'a palace of the modern magician', Cragside House was the first building in the world to be lit by hydroelectricity.

The estate, which has more an 30 miles of footpaths and lakeside walks, features gadgets well ahead of its time such as fire alarm buttons, telephones, a passenger lift and a Turkish bath suite.

It is also home to one of Europe's largest rock gardens, and features one of the oldest iron bridges of its type in Britain.

In fact, its 140-year-old Scots pine tree has been verified as Britain’s tallest tree – measuring 131ft (40m).

The property was created in 1863 by inventor and landscaper Lord William Armstrong, his wife Lady Margaret Armstrong, and their architect Richard Norman Shaw.

Lord Armstrong became a solicitor after leaving school, but had always had an interest in mechanics - and often took apart toys as a child to find out how they worked.

He became a civil and mechanical engineer and started on Cragside aged 53, before developing hydroelectricity there in 1878.

Light bulbs were installed there in 1880 and visitors travelled for miles to see how he had turned the power of water into electric light.

Lord Armstrong was also an armaments magnate, and effectively became chief gun manufacturer to the British Army after being knighted in 1859.

He was behind the accurate and practical Armstrong Gun, a breech-loader which re-equipped the Army after the Crimean War.
