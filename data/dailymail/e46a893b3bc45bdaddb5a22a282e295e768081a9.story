Liverpool are ready to exploit a little-known Premier League rule to sign Danny Ings despite failing with a bid for Burnley’s striker in the transfer window.

The Merseyside club were prepared to pay £4million for Ings and loan him back to Burnley for the rest of the season, but were told that such a deal is against the regulations.

However, it has emerged that, under Rule U8, Liverpool can sign a pre- contract with Ings and his club — subject to the approval of the Premier League Board — which guarantees the player a transfer to Anfield in the summer while allowing him to stay at Burnley for the rest of this season.

The rule is designed to ensure transparency. While such an agreement is unusual, a similar deal was struck between Manchester United and Fulham for Chris Smalling in January 2010 which set out the defender’s £10m move to Old Trafford six months later.

Smalling never played against United in that time, however, while Ings is set to face Liverpool when Burnley visit Anfield in a month.

One of the criteria the board will examine is that there is no conflict of interest, such as undue pressure being put on Ings or Burnley for him to miss that game.

Burnley were determined not to let Ings leave in the January window as they fight to stay in the Premier League, but have accepted he will not sign a new contract when his four-year deal runs out at the end of the season.

They stand to receive about £3m in compensation if he joins another English club in the summer but only £200,000 if he moves abroad. There was speculation on deadline day that the England Under 21 striker was close to agreeing a pre- contract with Real Sociedad.

Manager Sean Dyche admitted after Saturday’s defeat at Sunderland that the speculation had affected Ings’s performance.

The 22-year-old is known to favour a move to Liverpool and the feeling at Turf Moor is that he will perform better for the remainder of the season if his future is resolved.

Liverpool are prepared to pay up to £5m to keep Ings out of the clutches of their rivals.

First on the agenda for Liverpool tonight is the FA Cup fourth-round replay against Bolton.

They may start with Daniel Sturridge — once a popular loan player at Bolton — as they look to advance in a competition manager Brendan Rodgers desperately wants to win after last week’s narrow Capital One Cup semi-final defeat at Chelsea.

‘If anything, that defeat has only promoted the development and momentum that we have,’ said the Liverpool manager.

‘Of course we wanted to get to the final but the performance level from the two games has given us great encouragement.

‘Our best football is yet to come. We have got our identity back. We want to take that into the games and get to cup finals.

‘It will be a tough game for us. We have a big month coming up and we want to continue in the cup competitions as well as keeping the momentum going in the league.’
