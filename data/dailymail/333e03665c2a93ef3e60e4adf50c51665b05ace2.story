A grandfather and veteran councillor has been reprimanded by council bosses for making what was claimed to be a ‘sexist’ remark about a colleague’s figure.

Mel Winter, 71, was carrying a cup of coffee in each hand when Labour councillor Hailey Townsend, 29, asked if he wanted her to open the door for him at their council HQ.

Mr Winter replied: ‘With a figure like that, you can hold the door all day.’

Long-standing councillor Mel Winter has been 
given a slap on the wrist for comments he made about fellow member 
Hailey Townsend's figure

Mel Winter later apologised to mother-of-two Mrs Townsend

Offended, Mrs Townsend  reported the remark to senior council officials.

Mr Winter was summoned by council legal director Andrew Jolley and warned about his behaviour.

Mr Winter, who has been an independent councillor in Bridgend, South Wales, for 30 years, said: ‘It is a sad day when you can’t make a compliment to a lady.

‘I think of myself as a gentleman and I get on with most women, young and old.

‘I was passing her a compliment in good faith and in a light-hearted manner. I’m very sorry she has taken it in the wrong way. I felt quite annoyed that it had happened to me after 30 years working on the council.

‘The saying that it is political correctness gone mad come to mind.’

The mother called the comments inappropriate

Mr Winter later apologised to mother-of-two Mrs Townsend, who was elected last year.

Mrs Townsend reported Mr Winter for 
saying: ‘With a figure like that, you can hold the door all day’, 
although Mr Winter claims he actually said: ‘With a body like that...’

Mr Winter went on: ‘Whether  it was body or figure, if I say  something and I’m wrong, I  will apologise. 

‘But you have to be so careful how you even look at people these days. You just can’t have a bit of a craic any more.

‘The whole atmosphere at the council has changed for the worse over the past 20 years or so.

‘You would never believe the stuff that used to go on in the good old days.’

Mrs Townsend, who is also vice-chairman of Bridgend Labour Party, defended her complaint.

She said: ‘Elected members should be role models and champions for equality and diversity.

‘I’m therefore surprised and 
disappointed that Councillor Winter would choose to repeat some of his 
inappropriate comments about my appearance.

‘I had accepted his apology and considered that to be the end of the matter.

‘I can only hope this serves to highlight that there is no place for sexist and inappropriate comments within the workplace.’

A spokesman for Bridgend County 
Borough Council confirmed the complaint was resolved after a 
‘discussion’ between Mr Winter and the legal director.
