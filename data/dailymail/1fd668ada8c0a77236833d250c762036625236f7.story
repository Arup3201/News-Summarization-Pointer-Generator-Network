This weekend's Premier League action begins with the small matter of the north London derby on Saturday lunchtime, a fiery fixture made even more important with Tottenham and Arsenal both battling for fourth place.

Spurs will undoubtedly call on the in-form Harry Kane at White Hart Lane, but another of Mauricio Pochettino's strikers can also stake a strong claim for a starting place against the Gunners.

Emmanuel Adebayor, who almost joined West Ham on transfer deadline day, has scored more goals in north London derbies than any other player, beating the likes of Arsenal legend Thierry Henry and former Spurs favourite Gareth Bale.

Tottenham striker Emmanuel Adebayor has scored more goals in north London derbies than any other player

Adebayor's last goal against his former club Arsenal came in a 5-2 defeat at the Emirates in November 2012

Booed by some Tottenham fans in recent weeks, Adebayor wasn't even on the bench for last Saturday's 3-0 win at West Brom.

But, having netted 10 goals in the fixture - eight of which have come in the Premier League - the statistics suggest that Pochettino should at least consider a recall for the out-of-favour forward.

Adebayor, who played for Arsenal between 2006 and 2009, scored six top-flight goals against his current employers and another two in cup competitions before leaving for big-spending Manchester City in a £25million deal.

He joined the Gunners' arch rivals Tottenham on loan two years later and made the move permanent in 2012, scoring twice against Arsene Wenger's men during that time.

His last goal in the north London derby came at the Emirates in November 2012 when he opened the scoring before being sent off in the 18th minute for a wild tackle on Santi Cazorla. Arsenal went on to win the game 5-2.

Adebayor's form in the fixture means that he is also the top scorer when it comes to Premier League games only, beating former Gunners midfielder Robert Pires by a single strike.

The Frenchman bagged seven goals during his six-year stint under Wenger, two more than his compatriot Henry, Real Madrid star Bale and former team-mate Robin van Persie.

Five players have hit four goals in the fervent fixture - Freddie Ljungberg, Rafael van der Vaart, Patrick Vieira, Theo Walcott and Ian Wright.

The form of Arsenal's players in front of goal has meant Tottenham have kept just one clean sheet in their last 32 Premier League north London derbies, a 0-0 draw at White Hart Lane in February 2009.

Defender Emmanuel Eboue saw red in the first half that day but the Gunners held on to claim a point, despite the best efforts of Robbie Keane on his second debut for the club.

That match was one of 18 Premier League games between the two clubs to have ended in a draw, making it the most drawn fixture in the history of the competition.

Wenger, who took charge at Highbury in 1996, has overseen the majority of those games but there has been notably less stability at Spurs, who have had 12 permanent managers during the Frenchman's reign.

The 65-year-old faced his 11th Tottenham manager as his side drew 1-1 with Pochettino's men back in September, while he didn't get the chance to take on Jacques Santini in 2004 as the ex-Lyon boss resigned after just 13 games in charge. 

Wenger has come under pressure for a shortage of silverware in recent years but he has ensured local bragging rights have remained with Arsenal fans at the end of each of his seasons in charge.

Tottenham last finished above the Gunners way back in 1995 when ending the season in seventh place left them five positions better off than caretaker Stewart Houston's side.

Bruce Rioch reversed the trend during the 1995-96 campaign, leading the Gunners to fifth spot and a UEFA Cup place, before Wenger took charge in October 1996. 

The former Monaco boss has helped his side finish above Spurs for 18 seasons, giving them a 19-year dominance over their neighbours - an English record for two clubs in the same division.
