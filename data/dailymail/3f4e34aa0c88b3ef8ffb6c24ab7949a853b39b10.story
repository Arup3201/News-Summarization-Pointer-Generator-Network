Rio Ferdinand has been involved in a furious exchange with FA chairman Greg Dyke after the governing body released the reasoning behind their decision to ban him for three games.

The QPR defender was branded reckless and irresponsible by FA chiefs after using the word ‘sket’ — slang for a promiscuous woman — in an exchange with another Twitter user on September 1.

Highlighting his profile as a role model, the FA’s Independent Regulatory Commission gave their written judgment into the reasoning behind the punishments, which also include a £25,000 fine and an educational programme. 

Rio Ferdinand has been told he 'should have known better'  by the FA in relation to his three-match ban

QPR defender Ferdinand was given a three-game suspension by the FA and will not appeal his ban

Ferdinand is regular Twitter user, having sent more than 14,000 Tweets since setting up an account in 2010

It is understood Ferdinand, who served the first game of his ban last Saturday when he missed the game against Chelsea, made it clear to Dyke last week he no longer wished to be involved in any FA initiatives.

Now, in a damning statement, the Commission reported: ‘With nearly six million followers Mr Ferdinand is clearly an experienced Twitter user and he should know better than to respond in the way that he did.

‘It is said on his behalf that he is one of the most high profile sportsmen on Twitter and he is a role model for many young people, no doubt throughout the world. His responsibility is therefore that much greater than many others.

‘Unfortunately there is no formal or direct admission and there is certainly no sign of remorse.’

It is the second-time that Ferdinand has been reprimanded for an offensive tweet aimed at someone by the FA

In 2012 the defender was fined £45,000 by the FA for using the term 'choc ice' targeted towards Ashley Cole

Ferdinand was charged with misconduct for this tweet, made on September 1, for using the slang term 'sket' - the FA deemed the tweet 'abusive and/or indecent and/or insulting and/or improper' with a reference to gender

Ferdinand's activity on social media - with 5.9million followers on his Twitter page - saw him punished harshly

Ferdinand tweeted his anger at the FA's punishment on Friday - the FA say he didn't show remorse

Joey Barton took to Twitter to support his team-mate Ferdinand, describing his ban as 'an absolute disgrace'

While Ferdinand's lawyers said it was a joke, expert opinion, the FA write, explain the word sket 'is a term of abuse and in this context would be taken as insulting'

Harry Redknapp criticised Ferdinand's ban and believes footballers would be better off without Twitter
