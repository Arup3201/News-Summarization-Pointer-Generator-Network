18 Again promises to make a woman 'feel like a virgin'

The awkward commercial, set in an extended family household, involves a woman dancing around the internal courtyard with her husband.

She repeatedly sings lines borrowed and from Madonna's Like A Virgin (but given a Bollywood makeover),  including 'ooh, I feel 
like a virgin' and 'it feels like the first time'.

Her husband grabs her waist and warbles 'oh, yes it's true' while an elderly couple of parents look on, seemingly aghast.

The film ends with a shot of the product, then a clip of the intrigued elderly couple apparently using the internet to order some of the cream for themselves.

Rishi Bhatia, chairman and managing director of Ultratech India, said: '18 Again is a first-of-its-kind product for women in India.

'This 
product is being launched in India post clinical trials conducted 
among women of all age groups under dermatological control.

'18 Again 
has the power and the potential to break the shackles and redefine the 
meaning of women empowerment altogether.'

Priti Nair, director of Curry-Nation, the creative agency behind the advert, said: 'This is a one-of-a-kind women-centric 
product, and the idea is to create a demand for such a product in the 
Indian market.

'Since the product is targeted towards concerns that are 
not usually talked about publicly, the challenges of creating a campaign
 for this is also higher.

'Since the the product is primarily targeted at
 housewives with children, we wanted to create a film that is tasteful 
yet engaging.'

According to online Indian news magazine Tehelka.com, Curry-Nation's 
account manager Nagessh Pannaswami has said that a tighter vagina is 
empowering because 'it's not just about sexual pleasure, but also about 
preventing infection, discharge, urinary incontinence, and making older 
women feel good'.

But Professor Nivedita Menon of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, 
condemns the product, saying he finds the idea both 'hilarious and 
maddening'.

He says: 'The perversity of it all lies in the fact that the gel will
 be sold as a health issue, as something women "should" do to take 
better care of their bodies.'

Twitter users have taken to the social networking site to condemn both the cream and the advert.

A user named Parmesh Shahani ‏tweets: 'Astounded that @18Again and #WomenOnTop campaign promotes "India's first natural vaginal tightening and rejeuventation gel" as "empowerment".'

Ram Cobin writes: 'A vaginal tightening gel. With a tastefully done, clutter-breaking idea "Feel like a virgin". This is advertising in progressive India. Argh.'

The advertising strapline for the product was: 'Life for women will now be fresher, cleaner and more importantly fairer and more intimate.'

The product was seen by many in India as a sad indictment of discrimination against darker skin within the social caste system.
