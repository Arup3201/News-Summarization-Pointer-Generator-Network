Butterflies in Japan are suffering from 'serious abnormality' following the radioactive fallout after the Fukushima nuclear disaster.

Scientists found unusually small wings and mutations in the legs and antennae of insects collected in May last year, two months after the earthquake and subsequent tsunami struck.

The radiation exposure harmed their genes and the damage could be passed on to future generations, according the journal Scientific Reports.

It said that 'artificial radionuclides
from the Fukushima (No 1) nuclear power plant caused physiological and 
genetic damage' to pale grass blue butterflies, a common species in 
Japan.

'Sensitivity (to 
irradiation) varies between species, so research should be conducted on 
other animals,' said Joji Otaki, a team member and associate professor 
at the University of the Ryukyus in Okinawa.

'Humans
are totally different from butterflies and they should be far more 
resistant' to the health effects of radiation, Otaki noted.

The researchers collected 121 adult pale grass blue butterflies in and outside Fukushima Prefecture in May 2011, two months after the nuclear crisis started.

Abnormalities such as unusually small wings were found in 12 per cent of the total. But the rate rose to 18 per cent in a second generation produced through mating among the butterflies collected and some even died before reaching adulthood.

When second generation butterflies with abnormal traits mated with healthy ones, the rate of abnormalities rose to 34 percent in the third generation, according to the article.

The team collected another 238 butterflies last September and determined that the abnormality rate stood at 28 per cent.

However, it nearly doubled to 52 per cent among a second generation born to the original butterflies caught.

It was after breeding them, theyÂ  noticed various abnormalities that hadn't been seen in the previous generation, such as malformed antennae.

The researchers said the butterflies collected in May were heavily exposed to radiation as larvae.

The impact was apparently more severe on the second generation, as well as on the butterflies collected in September, because they suffered heavy exposure at a far earlier stage while they were still fertilized eggs or just reproduction cells, according to the team.

The impact of artificial radiation exposure on the species was also investigated using larvae collected in Okinawa, one of the prefectures least affected by fallout from the nuclear disaster.

After the larvae were exposed to radiation and fed with leaves contaminated with radioactive materials, similar rates of abnormalities and premature deaths were observed, the article said.
