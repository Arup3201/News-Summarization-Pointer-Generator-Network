Defending Commonwealth heptathlon bronze medallist Grace Clements has been called up to Team England for the 2014 Games following Morgan Lake’s withdrawal.

As first revealed by Sportsmail, 17-year-old Lake has decided to concentrate on the World Junior Championships in Oregon, USA, instead of competing in the heptathlon in Glasgow.

The teenager had a difficult dilemma about whether to prioritise her age-group championships or win her first senior international vest at a multi-sport event without the support of her father and coach, Eldon, in the athletes’ village.

Lake said: ‘This has been an extremely difficult decision for me to take as I was honoured to be selected to Team England, but ultimately it’s right for me and my development to focus on the World Juniors.

‘I want to wish Grace and the rest of Team England all the very best and I’ll be cheering them all on.’

The sensitive nature of Lake’s withdrawal has allowed England to call up Clements to compete alongside Jessica Taylor and Katarina Johnson-Thompson. Clements, 30, won bronze behind Louise Hazel in Delhi four years ago.

Clements said: ‘It is great to be back on the team having medalled four years ago. I have been through a tough four years, so this is like a dream come true - a fairy tale ending to my career. I’m very grateful for this opportunity to compete in the Commonwealth Games.’

Jan Paterson, Chef de Mission of Team England, added: ‘We would like to welcome Grace, our heptathlon bronze medallist from Delhi, into Team England and I hope her final preparations for Glasgow go well.

‘We know it was a tough decision for Morgan to withdraw from the team, but we send her our very best wishes for the World Junior Athletics Championships.’
