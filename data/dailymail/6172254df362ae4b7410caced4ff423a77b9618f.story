Manager Vincenzo Montella has insisted Chelsea can only sign Juan Cuadrado from Fiorentina by paying his £26.8m release clause.

Chelsea have so far offered £20m plus bonuses but Fiorentina coach Montella said: 'The issue around Cuadrado is very simple: he has a buy-out clause, which was written into his contract along with the club. If a team comes along and pays it, and the player wants to leave, then he can go.

Chelsea are reportedly ready to meet the winger's £26.8m buyout clause to bring him to Stamford Bridge

'This clause expires during the last few days of the transfer window, but as far as we are concerned the player is not for sale.'

Andre Schurrle, who missed Saturday's FA Cup humiliation by Bradford City, apparently due to back trouble, is expected to join Wolfsburg this week, while Roma hope to agreed Mohamed Salah's loan ahead of Real Sociedad.

Chelsea are maintaining negotiations with Shakhtar Donetsk for Douglas Costa and have offered £18.7million. They have also considered Enner Valencia of West Ham as a back-up option.

Winger came to the attention of clubs including Manchester United  following his World Cup performances

Cuadrado, who was one of the stand-out players alongside James Rodriguez for Colombia in last year's World Cup in Brazil, is under contract until June 2019.

The Colombian has scored four goals and set up four more in 16 league appearances for Fiorentina so far this season.

Cuadrado scored from the penalty spot to help Fiorentina beat Atalanta 3-1 on Wednesday night and reach the quarter finals of the Coppa Italia.
