Kolo Toure has confirmed that he has no wish to leave Liverpool this summer despite interest from Turkish club Trabzonspor.

The Reds defender, who joined the club on a free transfer from Manchester City last summer, has dropped down the pecking order at Anfield after the arrival of Dejan Lovren from Southampton.

But the 33-year-old is determined to prove his worth to manager Brendan Rodgers next season and believes he will be given opportunities to play.

'Trabzonspor are interested in me but I have expressed my pleasure at being a Liverpool player,' Toure told Sport-Ivoire.

'Yes, it is always a possibility to join a lower league for more playing time but I am a competitor and I decided to stay at Liverpool.

'The season is full of matches in the league and Champions League and I know I have time to prove I'm still hungry but I know I will not play every game, that's for sure.

'I had talks with the coach, who clearly indicated that I was part of his plans.

'I feel good physically and at 33 years of age I am ready for any challenge.

Determined: Toure believes he will still get opportunities to play for Brendan Rodgers next season

'I continue to work hard in training to keep up the momentum and it is why the coach wants to keep me at Liverpool, because I am a fighter.

'I intend to start the season with the same goals: to enable the club to progress and to please all fans of Liverpool.

'It is a privilege to be at Liverpool. I am very happy to wear the shirt of this legendary club.

'The situation can change at any time but for the moment I am at Liverpool and I want to carry on with the club.'
