The widespread closure of public toilet closures could be putting lives at risk, health experts have warned.

Campaigners say being desperate to go to the toilet can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Four out of 10 public toilets have closed in the past decade and in Glasgow just eight public toilets remain open.Â 

Health experts say the closure of public toilets has increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes

Health experts say the situation is so bad it is 'leaving people prisoners in their own homes'.

Dr Clare Walton, of the Stroke Association, said: 'There is no research to suggest that holding a full bladder can directly increase your risk of stroke.

'However, not being able to empty your bladder could potentially cause a temporary increase in blood pressure which could put some individuals at risk of stroke.'

The Welsh Assembly was warned by 
health experts that full bladders could 'cause a stroke or heart attack' for old, ill and vulnerable people.

Carlisle City Council has halved its public toilets from 14 to seven in just five years, according to Freedom of Information request figures.

Newcastle City Council currently maintains 11 public toilets after closing five in 2008.

Renfrewshire Council have 
closed five, leaving just a solitary toilet open, and in the Scottish 
Borders, eight out of 50 have shut their doors.

Stirling
has been left with 16 after a dozen throughout the council area were 
shut in the past two years.

Association managing director Raymond Martin said: 'This is a health problem, not just a financial one.

'These cuts affect the health of the nation, with the elderly and disabled really hit hard.

'It's a major worry with many people feeling they are becoming prisoners in their own home.

'Not being able to go causes all sorts of medical problems, from raised blood pressure and bladder issues to infections.'

Budgets for public toilet provision in some authorities have been drastically reduced.

Of the Scots councils that supplied figures, the overall cut was more than 21 per cent.

Tourists visiting Lancaster have also seen a dramatic fall in the number of public loos. A total of 16 toilets have been shut since January 2008.

Areas of the Lake District have also seen a decline and Allerdale Borough Council, which includes the town of Keswick, has shut six toilets.

Mr Martin said: 'Making savings from toilets seems like the easy option for councils.

'But there's a desperate need to have toilets that are available, clean and hygienic.'

A meeting with the Older People's Commissioner for Wales was held by the BTA this week.

Such is the concern, the BTA has been asked to compile an up-to-date 'toilet map' of the UK by disability organisations.

Work is also being done with Age UK and Tourism for All with more 'community toilets', part-funded by locals increasingly being viewed as a way forward.

Michelle Mitchell, Age UK's Charity Director General, said: 'Public toilets are vital to many older people, enabling them to get out and about to access essential services.

'Worrying about being caught short or facing the indignity of having an accident in public can have a devastating impact on people in later life, resulting in many feeling increasingly stuck at home and cut off from the rest of society.'
