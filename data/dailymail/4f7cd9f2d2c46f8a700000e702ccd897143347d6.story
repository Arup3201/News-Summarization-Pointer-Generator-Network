The family of a model who died after falling from the balcony of her estranged husband’s apartment yesterday accused police of bungling the investigation into her death.

Sahar Daftary’s relatives said they had been denied justice as officers had failed to discover the truth about how she died.

Rashid Jamil, the husband of Miss Daftary, 23, has  claimed she committed suicide when she fell 150ft from the apartment they shared in Manchester.

Miss Daftary’s family refused to accept his explanation, and nearly four years after she died, a coroner yesterday recorded an open verdict on her death.

After the hearing, Miss Daftary’s 
mother, Anisa, said: ‘All we wanted is justice, a right that has been 
denied us by the police and their failure to investigate what happened. 
There are still many questions that need to be answered.’

The coroner’s verdict will allow Miss 
Daftary’s family to consider taking action against Mr Jamil, 37, who was
arrested on suspicion of her death but never charged, and Greater 
Manchester Police. 

Richard Slade, the family’s solicitor,
claimed: ‘Minimum mandatory steps required in every homicide 
investigation were not taken.’

Det Insp Joe Clarke told the inquest 
police had not carried out a forensic examination of Mr Jamil’s flat 
after Miss Daftary’s death in December 2008.

However, he said the couple were the 
only ones who had ‘legitimate access’ to the flat and therefore a 
forensic examination was not required.

The inquest, at Bolton Coroner’s Court, heard earlier this week that Mr Jamil and Miss Daftary had 'married' in an Islamic ceremony a year earlier but the wedding has no legal status in the UK.

The Manchester businessman and father-of-two was already married to another woman when his relationship began with Miss Daftary, a finance and accounting student at Thames Valley University.

Mr Jamil was initially questioned by police and later released without charge following an investigation into Miss Daftary’s death.

Mr Jamil told the inquest he was in 
the lounge of the apartment, on his mobile phone and looking the other 
way when he heard a short scream and realised Miss Daftary had fallen to
the ground.

Following a week-long hearing, Alison Hewitt, the assistant deputy coroner for Manchester, returned an open verdict today.

She
said there was insufficient evidence to prove to the required legal 
standard - beyond reasonable doubt - that Miss Daftary was unlawfully 
killed or had killed herself.

The coroner also said there was not enough evidence to satisfy her that the student may have accidentally fallen.

As
Miss Daftary’s relatives sobbed in the public gallery, the coroner 
said: 'I am left in the situation where, in my judgment, I am not able 
to reach any of those conclusions on the basis of the standard of prove 
required.

'And the law states that if that is 
the state of the evidence, then the correct conclusion is one of an open
verdict and I am going to record an open verdict.'

In
a statement released following the verdict, Miss Daftary’s mother, 
Anisa, said: 'Nothing will ever bring back our beloved Sahar.

'She was the heart of our family and her death has left a hole that will never be filled.

'Since
her death all we have wanted was justice, a right that has been denied 
us by police and their failure to properly investigate what happened to 
her.

Beautiful: The inquest heard that Mr Jamil
told police he had been having an affair with Miss Daftary for a couple
of years after meeting her in London while on a business trip

'We have never believed Sahar took 
her own life and hope that everyone can now see that her strength and 
personal beliefs show this to be the truth and that there are still many
questions that need to be answered about what happened to her.'

Outside the Coroner’s Court, Mr 
Jamil’s barrister, Eric Shannon, said: 'The conclusion of this inquest 
comes as a very welcome relief to Mr Jamil.

'This tragic death occurred three and a half years ago and attracted a great deal of media interest and speculation.

'A very thorough police investigation
cleared him, and the coroner, in a careful and extensive hearing, has 
made no finding of wrongdoing against him.

'This tragic loss has clearly deeply affected everybody touched by it.

'Mr Jamil now simply wants to return to his wife and family and continue normal life.'

Miss Daftary’s family described Greater Manchester Police’s investigation into her death as 'a shocking disgrace'.

Their solicitor, Richard Slade, said: 'Minimum mandatory steps, required in every homicide investigation, were not taken.

'The human consequences in the form of a delay in bringing these events to a just conclusion and the anguish suffered by Sahar’s close and loving family can only be imagined.'

He said the family will 'reflect' on what further action they may take.

GMP Assistant Chief Constable Terry Sweeney insisted tonight that their investigation followed every line of inquiry.

He said: 'First and foremost, our thoughts and condolences remain with the family following their devastating loss.

'It has been an extremely painful time for them.

'Following Sahar’s tragic death in December 2008, a thorough investigation was carried out by police in Salford.

'A file was prepared for the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) who reviewed the case and decided that no charges should be brought against a man who assisted us with these complex and sensitive inquiries.

'As recently as this month, Greater Manchester Police carried out an internal review of the investigation which also concluded that every possible line of inquiry was thoroughly looked into by detectives.

'We have responded to every request made by the family’s solicitors and looked into all allegations of possible third-party involvement and found no evidence whatsoever to substantiate any of these claims.

'There was no issue regarding DNA evidence or fingerprints as we had established who had been present in the flat and this would not have been relevant in taking the investigation forward.

'Since Sahar’s death, all our inquiries have been carried out under the full rigour of scrutiny of the CPS and the overview of HM Coroner and I am completely satisfied that no more could have been done to investigate Sahar’s death.'
