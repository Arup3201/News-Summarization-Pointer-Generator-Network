The Police were forced to issue an embarrassing apology to thousands of delayed Bank Holiday travellers after closing the busy M6 motorway in both directions to deal with a terrorist threat which eventually turned out to be just a minor case of fuel theft.

Warwickshire Police closed a section of the M6 motorway after receiving reports of suspicious activity around a white Ford transit van which had stopped to refuel at Corley service station around 2.30pm.

Warwickshire Police responded by closing the M6 in both directions between junction 2 near Coventry and junction 4 near Coleshill.

Investigation: What appears to be a bomb disposal robot approaches a vehicle at the Corley service station

Images on TV news channels from the scene appeared to show a bomb disposal robot approaching a white transit van.

Tailbacks up to 12 miles long were then reported as a consequence of the emergency action.

In a statement on Warwickshire Police website, Superintendent Martin Samuel, area commander for north Warwickshire, said: 'We take all reports of suspicious activity and vehicles very seriously, and take whatever action is appropriate to protect people.

'On this occasion we were informed of
a vehicle which had stopped at the service station to refuel and two 
men were seen behaving suspiciously around it.

'Following the horrific events in 
Woolwich on Wednesday everyone is acutely aware of the threats which 
some individuals pose and the harm which they are intent on causing.

'After a thorough investigation by 
police officers and military personnel I can confirm that the vehicle 
was not carrying an explosive device, as reported by some people, and 
the incident is now being treated as a bulk fuel theft.

'I would like to apologise to anyone 
who was caught up in traffic as a result of the investigation at the 
service station, but I am sure you will appreciate that the precaution 
of closing the motorway was necessary.

'Not only was it rush hour, but the 
start of the bank holiday weekend. It's hard to think of a more 
difficult time to close the motorway. I would like to thank the member 
of the public who reported his suspicions, and everyone who has worked 
on this incident tonight.'

A man was detained by officers, arrested
and taken into custody in Leamington. Another man is still outstanding,
Warwickshire Police said.

The Severn Bridge was closed earlier today when a motorcyclist died after a collision featuring several vehicles.

Two cars, one van and a motorcycle were all involved in the collision on the M4 eastbound at 5.50pm.

The crash caused long delays and disruption in both directions, and the alternative M48 route was restricted to one lane due to high winds.

Two westbound lanes were shut so that emergency services could reach the scene.

Thousands
of commuters in London also suffered major delays after London Bridge 
station was closed while armed police dealt with another incident.

Social media sites were full of reports that a man was seen in the vicinity of the station with an axe.

The station was closed for at least 20 minutes as alarmed passengers were evacuated. It was reopened later with no reports of arrests.

Holidaymakers leaving the UK for the long weekend were also hit by traffic delays this afternoon, as the Bank Holiday getaway got into full swing.

Traffic was queued for up to six miles on the anti-clockwise carriageway between Swanley and the Dartford Crossing.

The M6 was brought to a standstill again by another white van, this time after a traffic accident just 15 miles from the site of the bomb scare near Cudworth, Warwickshire
