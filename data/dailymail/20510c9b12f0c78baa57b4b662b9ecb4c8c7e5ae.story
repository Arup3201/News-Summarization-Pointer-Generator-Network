Roberto Martinez admits his team does have a defensive problem – but insists he is not concerned by the performances of Tim Howard despite the American’s poor showing in Everton’s back-to-back defeats.

For the second time in 48 hours the American was off form, sharing responsibility for two of Crystal Palace’s three goals on Sunday and then making weak attempts to keep out strikes from Nathan Dyer and Marvin Emnes in their 3-0 defeat at Swansea on Tuesday.

Martinez was forced to defend his usually reliable goalkeeper at the weekend and did so again after their Capital One Cup loss at the Liberty Stadium.

But it cannot be lost on Martinez that Howard, 35, has now conceded 17 goals this season – 13 in the Barclays Premier League, which is the most in the division – and his defence in general has been a major weak point so far this season.

Asked about Howard’s confidence, Martinez said: ‘I am not concerned. If it was a young goalkeeper or someone who has not got the experience maybe you can think about how he could get affected by these experiences.

‘But Tim is in the best moment of his career. The experience he has, he knows how to control every single performance that he has.

‘Those moments happen and we need to address them. But that’s not just with the keeper, we need to address them as a team.’

In reference to Everton’s defence, Martinez added: ‘It is something we need to address.’
