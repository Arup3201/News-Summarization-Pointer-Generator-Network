The grieving family of a deceased Californian man is now trying to find his missing body after the funeral home he was in closed down.

Morris Carruth, 45, died of a heart on August 9, and his body was placed in the hands of Advanced Care Funeral and Cremation in Sacramento.

But the Carruth family were never given Morris’s remains, despite asking the funeral home to cremate him two months ago.

Advanced Care Funeral and Cremation in Sacramento lost the body after the business closed down

Carruth’s sister, Lisa Evans, said she visited the offices of the Sacramento company and found the funeral home closed down and cleared out.

She told Fox40 News: ‘The new stress is now we can’t find his body.

‘He was to be cremated after the funeral, they told us the body would be delivered to us in two weeks, and it never happened.’

It has now been revealed that Advanced Care Funeral Services had their license revoked by the state of California and in consequence, shut down.

The California State Cemetery and Funeral Bureau is currently investigating the company for mishandling five people’s remains and has a temporary restraining order.

State agents also revealed the director of Advanced Care Funeral Services was only working minimal hours and might have authorised non-licensed people to work with the remains of bodies.

Evans said she now has no idea where her brother’s remains are.

‘I owe this to him, most defiantly owe this to him, he needs to rest in peace and he is not in peace right now’, she said.
