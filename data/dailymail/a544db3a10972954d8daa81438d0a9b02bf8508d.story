A Hong Kong man allegedly strangled his mistress and their two-year-old son before hiding their bodies under the bed in a rented apartment in south China for 14 years.

Kan Wai-nam, 53, was arrested last month after cleaners discovered the bodies of his second family in a bag underneath the bed in the apartment in the Buji district of Shenzhen.

Kan, who also had a wife and two children in Hong Kong, reportedly confessed to killing his mistress and their son in May 2000.

Kan Wai-nam allegedly strangled his mistress and their two-year-old son before hiding their bodies under the bed in a rented apartment in south China for 14 years

He allegedly told police he strangled his mistress and their child while struggling with debts of hundreds of thousands of yuan and a gambling addiction, the South China Morning Post has reported, citing the Southern Metropolis Daily.

He had reportedly committed to supplying a monthly allowance of 2,000 yuan to his Shenzhen family while also supporting his family in Hong Kong.

The bodies were discovered after Kan asked his landlord to clean one of two adjacent top-floor flats he had been renting at the apartment block in Buji.

He reportedly told his landlord one of the flats was being used for accommodation while the other was used as a utility room.

The cleaner sent by the landlord mistakenly walked into the wrong flat where she discovered the bag containing the bodies.

Rent
 continued to be paid to the landlord while the mistress is understood 
to have lost contact with rural family members and was not reported 
missing, according to the Shanghaiist.

The Buji district of Shenzhen, known as 'Little Hong Kong', became a 'mistress village' in the 1980s and 1990s as workers and cross-border drivers kept girlfriends there, according to the South China Morning Post.

Shenzhen sits immediately north of Hong Kong in Southern China's Guangdong Province.

It was the first of China's Special Economic Zones, which has led to its rapid expansion, with the help of foreign investment, and is now southern mainland China's major financial centre.

It also has very close business, trade and social links with Hong Kong.

In December last year it was reported that smugglers dug a 'professional' concrete tunnel from Shenzhen into Hong Kong equipped with lights, vents, steel reinforcements and even rails to transport goods.

The underground path had 'one end in a rented garage in Shenzhen and another in a thicket of reeds in Hong Kong, totally concealed', said a report posted on the official website china.com.cn.
