French clubs produce more 'top class' footballers for teams across Europe's 'Big 5' leagues than those anywhere else in the world. As such, France’s Ligue 1 tops our table as the best producer of elite talent.

Spain’s La Liga plus the top divisions in Argentina, Brazil and Germany make up the top five producers of talent.

Fifty players raised at French clubs currently play in the Premier League alone, with 32 more in Italy’s Serie A, 23 in Spain’s La Liga, and 13 in the Bundesliga. France's talent factories have therefore produced 118 players working in other 'Big 5' leagues, as well as a further 373 other places still making a living in France.

Some 75 of those 373 players are at French international level already so France has produced 193 current players for 'Big 5' export and / or of ‘international class’.

The corresponding numbers for the other ‘Big 5’ leagues are 133 for La Liga in Spain (58 exports), 95 for the Bundesliga (20 exports), 94 for the Premier League (19 exports, most of them not English) and 93 for Serie A (18 exports).

Argentinean and Brazilian clubs produce more top-class talent for the ‘Big 5’ leagues (111 and 103 players respectively) than Germany, England or Spain.

The data for this part of MailSport’s wide-ranging study on the comparative strengths of the leagues comes the highly respected Swiss-based CIES Football Observatory.

The 'Big 5' leagues used as a measure of talent production in this instance because the planet’s very best talent tends to migrate to these five leagues - and this is increasingly the case. They are the five richest leagues by income, offering the biggest salaries.

Outside the ‘Big 5’ league and the two South American giants, Dutch clubs produce the most top-class players (53 of them currently playing at ‘Big 5’ clubs), followed by clubs from Portugal (42), Switzerland (41), Belgium (34), Colombia (24) and Croatia (21).

Spanish clubs have produced 324 players still in La Liga plus 24 in England, 18 in Serie A, 14 in the Bundesliga and two playing in France. Italian clubs have produced 278 players in Serie A, six in the Premier League, five in La Liga and four in Ligue 1.

Bundesliga and Premier League clubs have produced 270 players for their own leagues, with the Bundesliga producing 20 for other ‘Big 5’ leagues combined and the Premier League 19 for the other leagues combined.
