Arrest: Diego Santos, 27, is paraded in front of the cameras in November 2010. One image of him wearing this polo shirt caught the attention of a leading Brazilian fashion photographer

One of South America's most feared drug lords is set to tread the catwalk as a male model at Brazil's biggest fashion event, it was reported today.

Diego Santos, 27, was until recently the boss of a powerful drug gang which controlled the sprawling Complexo do Alemao slum in Rio de Janeiro.

But this week the reformed criminal once known as 'Mister M' will be one of the star attractions at the world famous Sao Paulo Fashion Week.

The vast Alemao shantytown, home to 
65,000 people, was once a no-go zone for police ruled by a trafficking 
gang notorious for its brutality.

But in November 2010 the slum was invaded by army troops as part a programme of 'pacification' of the city's favelas.

Diego had been the drug kingpin for 12 years but handed himself to police on the day the military force invaded.

He
was photographed surrendering to soldiers wearing a shirt of upmarket 
Brazilian clothing brand Reserva, a picture which he later discovered 
caught the attention of fashion photographer JR Duran.

Santos served nine months in jail before being released on parole.

He told Globo's G1 website: 'When the police invaded I thought, my time's up, I'm not going to run.

'My dream was always to become a model but I never had the chance. My whole life I liked fashion and always tried to dress well.

'After I left prison Duran asked me if I wanted to be a fashion model because I had looked so good in that photo.'

Diego,
who is married with two children, is now set to join the likes of 
Alessandra Ambrosio and Carol Trentini at Sao Paulo Fashion Week later 
this week, modelling clothes from Rio de Janeiro clothing brand AR.

He said: 'I think I'll bring something new. The models I've seen are too thin. I haven't seen any that I've liked.

'When
I was a trafficker I'd earn 5,000 reals (Â£1,600) a week. I made a lot 
of money, but I couldn't spend it. If I knew life could be so good I 
would never have entered the world of crime.'
