Tragic: Kate Dixon, 41, was brutally stabbed after her boyfriend Jonathan Tebbs found she had met someone else on a dating site, a court heard

A jealous lover murdered his girlfriend over her affair with a man she met on a dating site for Oxbridge graduates, a court heard.

Jonathan Tebbs, 46, stabbed dedicated town hall chief Kate Dixon 29 times with a Swiss Army knife, it is claimed, before reading an Oscar Wilde poem about a man who kills his wife.

He stripped her clothes off and calmly carried her into the shower where he washed the blood from her lifeless body, it is alleged.

The killer attempted to scrub the murder scene clean and then searched on the internet for Wilde’s The Ballad of Reading Gaol, which includes the verse: ‘Yet each man kills the thing he loves … The coward does it with a kiss, the brave man with the sword.’

Southwark Crown 
Court heard that Tebbs denies the murder of Ms Dixon, 41, but has 
pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished 
responsibility.

Miss Dixon, 41, a public servant at Islington Council, north London, endured a stormy relationship with Tebbs for more than 12 years after meeting on the Tube.

But he was increasingly possessive as she became ‘more and more disillusioned’, the court was told.

She began using Blues Match – a dating website for graduates of Oxford and Cambridge universities – and in March last year met a man called Mark with whom she began a relationship.

On the night of June 30 she summoned the courage to tell Tebbs she was leaving him. He responded by attacking her so violently the blade pierced her heart and lungs.

Prosecutor Gillian Etherton QC told the jury: ‘He took out what he later referred to [in interviews with] police as his Swiss Army knife and deliberately, purposefully, repeatedly and with severe force stabbed Kate to death.

'The multiple stab wounds are 
distributed principally to the front of the chest, but also to both arms
 and to the back of her legs.

'You will have little difficulty in coming to the conclusion, she must have tried desperately to defend herself.'

Tebbs then attempted to remove the blood stains from Miss Dixon’s flat in Streatham, south London, before conducting internet searches about poetry and writing a will.

The jury was told that Tebbs believed he and Miss Dixon – described by colleagues as extremely dedicated – were ‘meant to be together’.

Southwark Crown Court heard Tebbs denies the murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter

The couple had been in an on-off relationship for 12 years at the time of her death in June, last year, having met on a Tube train.

Although there is no evidence he was violent towards her before her death, the court heard, there were several occasions when she was left ‘fearful’ of him.

Mrs Etherton said the victim wanted to end the relationship but was ‘frightened about what his reaction might be’.

She added: ‘He was an intelligent 
man, but a controlling man … whilst it is accepted there were good times
 and Kate was very fond indeed of the defendant, it is clear that he 
could be very controlling of her, possessive and very jealous.

‘When he didn’t get his way with Kate, you will hear, he would verbally bully and intimidate her.’

Jurors heard that Ms Dixon 
began using Blues Match - an online dating site for Oxbridge graduates -
 and in March last year met a man called Mark with whom she began 
relationship.

Ms Etherton told 
the court: 'It seems that Kate's feelings towards Mark may well have 
given her the strength she needed to end her relationship with Jonathan 
Tebbs.'

In the days before 
her death, Miss Dixon exchanged text messages with Mark but Tebbs was 
suspicious and accessed her phone. He also caught her speaking to him 
via online video on Skype.

After the killing Tebbs moved money into his sister’s account and wrote a five-page statement before confessing to police.

Yet each man kills the thing he loves,By each let this be heard,Some do it with a bitter look,Some with a flattering word,The coward does it with a kiss,The brave man with a sword!

from The Ballad of Reading Gaol by Oscar Wilde

He
 was charged with murder the following day. Tebbs admits manslaughter on
 the grounds of diminished responsibility but denies murder.

Mrs
 Etherton said: ‘He had been aware of Mark for the best part of a week. 
However upset and angry …  Mr Tebbs’s behaviour was brutal and 
ultimately selfish.’

She
 added: ‘After the brutal killing of his girlfriend he is clear-headed, 
he is organised and he is putting his house in order.’

Ms Dixon's boyfriend threatened to kill her four years before he actually did so, a friend told the court.

Dominic
 Wynniatt-Husey, a lawyer who was advising the victim on her business 
dealings with Tebbs, urged her to contact the police about the threats.

'My
 only real recollection of anything that was said was that he threatened
 to kill her,' he said. 'It was a very awkward moment, I wasn't 
expecting this bombshell to be dropped'.

Ramita
 Navai - who first met Ms Dixon at Putney High School when they were 
both aged 11 - said that Tebbs initially seemed 'nice and normal' but 
had an 'explosive temper'.

She said her friend had phoned her in 2003 saying 'I need to leave' and adding 'I'm scared he's going to come back'.

A
 colleague of Ms Dixon at Islington Council, where she worked with 
vulnerable children, told the court that Tebbs had kicked in his 
girlfriend's door and demanded her wages.

'I
 would say he was quite intimidating in the sense that when she joined 
the council he was on her case quite a lot about money,' Bianca Robinson
 said.

'He sent her text messages asking her to come out to meet him. It was threatening and very intimidating for her.'

The trial continues.
