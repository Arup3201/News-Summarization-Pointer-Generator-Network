Extraordinary attack: Prime Minister David Cameron

David Cameron launched an extraordinary attack yesterday on moaning military chiefs who openly questioned the length of the war in Libya.

In a humiliating public slapdown, the Prime Minister told complaining top brass: ‘You do the fighting and I’ll do the talking’.

His withering criticism came after the RAF’s second-in-command warned that the Armed Forces would struggle to respond to future emergencies if operations against Colonel Muammar Gaddafi dragged on beyond the summer.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Simon Bryant said fighting simultaneous conflicts in Afghanistan and the Middle East was placing ‘huge’ demands on airmen and aircraft.

Morale in the RAF was ‘fragile’ and ‘fighting spirit’ was threatened by being overworked and the impact of the Coalition’s unpopular defence cuts, he added.

Air Chief Marshal Bryant’s assessment - contained in a leaked briefing paper to MPs - was the second time in a month a senior officer has cast serious doubt on the Government’s defence strategy.

Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, the head of the Royal Navy, claimed last week that Britain’s security would be at risk if the Libyan conflict lasted more than six months.

He said ministers faced having to make ‘challenging decisions’ - including the possibility of withdrawing ships currently patrolling home waters.

Mr Cameron’s woes deepened last night when General Sir Peter Wall, the head of the Army, appeared to question Downing Street’s timeline for withdrawing British troops from Afghanistan.

The Chief of the General Staff told a BBC 2 documentary to be broadcast tonight WED that ‘we shall find out nearer the time’ if the 2014 deadline was implemented.

The Prime Minister could barely conceal his frustration when asked about the latest intervention at a news conference in London.

He said: ‘There are moments when I wake up and read the newspapers and think: “I tell you what, you do the fighting and I’ll do the talking”.’

The Premier insisted that Chief of 
the Defence Staff General Sir David Richards and Admiral Stanhope - 
hauled into Number 10 last week for a dressing down - were ‘absolutely 
clear that we are able to keep up this mission for as long as is 
necessary’.

He said: ‘I’m 
absolutely confident that we can keep this pressure up. We can maintain 
this mission for as long as necessary. Time is on our side.’

Mr Cameron said that airmen’s morale and enthusiasm appeared ‘extremely high’ when he had spoken to them.

But Air Chief Marshal Bryant warned MPs that morale was ‘fragile’ and that many areas of the RAF were are ‘running hot’.

The
RAF has six Typhoon and 12 Tornado fighter jets flying daily missions 
in Libya and 10 Tornados, four Hercules transport aircraft and more than
20 helicopters in Afghanistan.

He said: ‘Two concurrent operations are placing a huge demand on equipment and personnel.

‘Should
Operation Ellamy [the codename for the Libyan operation] endure past 
defence planning assumptions the future contingent capability is likely 
to be eroded.’

First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Mark Stanhope, left, warned Britain's Navy would struggle if the conflict in Libya continued beyond a further 90 days. Air Chief Marshal Sir Simon Bryant, right, described morale as 'fragile'

He added: 
‘Morale remains fragile. Although fighting spirit remains positive, this
assessment will be challenged by individual harmony targets as 
Operation Ellamy endures [after September].

‘There is decreasing satisfaction with the remunerative offer, and allowances cut and the pay freeze continues to bite.’

The RAF will be cut by 5,000 troops over the next three years, reducing its strength to 32,000 personnel.

The
cuts made by the Government - another 12,000 Army and Navy personnel 
will be axed alongside warships, aircraft and tanks - had led to dire 
warnings of the consequences for Britain’s safety.

Critics
believe Mr Cameron should reopen the Strategic Defence and Security 
Review in light of its growing irrelevance in light of ‘Arab Spring’ 
uprisings.

Wing Commander 
Andrew Brookes, director of the Air League, said: ‘They are rightly 
saying to David Cameron, “Yes, oh leader, we will do what you want but 
we can’t do it for long because you have hobbled our services.

‘We
simply cannot fight war after war after war because there is a bill to 
be paid in terms of resources and rest and recuperation of our troops.’

Liberal
Democrat MP Sir Menzies Campbell, a member of the Commons Foreign 
Affairs Committee, said: ‘First the Navy, now the RAF: defence decisions
are coming home to roost.

‘You can have increased defence commitments and cuts but you can’t have both at the same time.’

Shadow
defence secretary Jim Murphy said: ‘Senior RAF officers are clear that 
ministers’ decisions will mean within weeks our forces will be at their 
limit.

‘We support action 
in both Libya and Afghanistan, which are important for our own national 
security, but it is vital that our forces are sufficiently equipped.’

The UN-sanctioned mission to protect Libyan civilians from Gaddafi’s regime has so far lasted three months.

The RAF is enforcing a no-fly zone and carrying out bombing raids against the dictator’s military.

The Navy has four ships off the coast carrying out various tasks, including launching missiles and mine-sweeping.

Meanwhile,
George Osborne has said the Ministry of Defence will give an update on 
the cost of the Libya campaign in the next week.
