A father-of-three from Ohio has been imprisoned in North Korea during a tourism trip to the communist country.

Jeffrey Edward Fowle was allegedly arrested after leaving a Bible in a hotel room, although his attorney said that his client was not part of a mission.

The 56-year-old is the third American to be held in North Korea, where missionary Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller are also detained.

Arrested: Father-of-three Jeffrey Fowle is being held by the North Korean authorities

Mr Fowle, who works for the street department of Moraine City, had arrived in North Korea on April 29. It is believed he was traveling without his wife, Tatyana, and their children.

According to his family, the secretive state is holding Mr Fowle on charges of an unspecified crime.

The state Korean Central News Agency said authorities were investigating him for committing acts inconsistent with the purpose of a tourist visit. It did not give details.

U.S. officials confirmed the detention but didn't identify Mr Fowle for privacy reasons, nor comment on reports that he was held after leaving a Bible in his hotel room.

A spokesman for the family, and Mr Fowle's attorney, have both said he was not on a mission for his church at the time of his arrest.

Timothy Tepe, an attorney who is acting as the Fowle family spokesman, confirmed that North Korea was holding Fowle.

He said the family would issue statement on Monday and not comment until then, 'given the sensitive nature of Jeff's situation'.

'This is a very fluid situation that has just come to light and they need time to process it,' Mr Tepe said.

Detained: American Kenneth Bae was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor in North Korea

He
 added that the family man was not on a mission for his church, 
Urbancrest Baptist Church in Lebanon, Ohio, and that he was just 
visiting North Korea as a tourist.

Mark
 Edward Howard, who attends Fowle's church, described him as 'a very 
good Christian father, a very loving father to his children'.

He
 said that Mr Fowle's wife, Tatyana, is a Russian immigrant with limited
 English, and that Mr Fowle always stayed close to her side in case she 
needed interpretation.

'They are pretty much inseparable,' he said. 'You never see him not by her side. They're a very nice family.'

Jeff Seidel told WHIO he had spoken to Mrs Fowle, who said she had asked her husband not to travel to North Korea.

'She tried to tell him not to go because it was too dangerous and something might happen, and he didn't listen to her and he went ahead and went anyway,' he said.

In
 a statement, U.S. Rep. Michael Turner, a Dayton, Ohio Republican, said 
he was 'deeply troubled by the detainment of American and Miamisburg 
resident Jeffery Edward Fowle, by the authoritarian government of North 
Korea'.

'We have been in 
contact with the State Department and will continue to carefully monitor
 Fowle's detainment as we await the release of additional information,' 
he said.

North Korea has been pushing to promote 
tourism as part of efforts to earn much-needed foreign currency, but 
the country is extremely sensitive about how visitors act while in 
the country.

State Department spokeswoman Marie 
Harf did not say whether Sweden, which handles consular matters for 
Americans in North Korea, had been granted access to the latest 
detainee.

'This is the third
 U.S. citizen that has been detained in North Korea,' Ms Harf said, adding that there was 'No greater priority for us 
than the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens abroad'.

The State Department warns against traveling in North Korea and tells travelers that being part of a tour group is no protection against the risk of arrest.

On April 10, American Matthew Miller was arrested for alleged improper behavior when he arrived in the country.

The 24-year-old is accused of tearing up a tourist visa and demanding asylum, according to a North Korean report that stated that he had chosen the country 'as a shelter'.

The third American being held is Mr Bae, who was sentenced to 15 years' hard labor after making what the country described as 'hostile acts' against it.

The announcement on Friday that North Korea was holding a third American, comes as tension on the Korean peninsula remains high.

The North has kept up its rhetoric against the U.S. and South Korea, after making a series of missile launches earlier in the year.

The peninsula is still in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea to deter potential aggression from North Korea.

In December, North Korea released 85-year-old American veteran of the Korean War, Merrill Newman, who was held for several weeks after traveling to North Korea as a tourist.

Mr Newman was freed after he gave a videotaped confession in which he apologized for killing North Koreans during the war. He later said the confession was given involuntarily and under duress.
