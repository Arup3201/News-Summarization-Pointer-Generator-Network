Yasmin Le Bon recently caused a stir when she stepped out with sheared locks and now it seems her daughter is competing for the attention.

Amber wowed onlookers at Fashion Night Out last night as she took to the catwalk with her shocking pink and blue dyed hair.

The model strutted down the catwalk at Westfield London as onlookers, including The Only Way Is Essex stars 
Jessica Wright and Sam Faiers, watched enthusiastically.

The
 co-stars managed to get a spot in a the coveted front row and looked super glamorous in their best dresses.

Speaking about her drastic new hair style, Amber said: 'I've just dyed half of my blonde streaks pink and red.

'I did it myself and know it looks shocking but I agree with Mum that a girl shouldn't get stuck in a rut and a time warp with hairstyles - like so many women do.

'Even I was shocked when Mum lopped off so much of her lovely hair, but she told me she really needed a radical change as a sort of mental stimulus!'

But, says Amber, 23,: 'Maybe I'm more cautious than Mum because I've only dyed half of my head- and it will wash out after a few months!'

Breaking the mould: 'I did it myself and know it looks shocking but I agree with Mum that a girl shouldn't get stuck in a rut and a time warp with hairstyles like so many women do,' Amber says

Her boyfriend Jonny Hynes likes her crazy coloured new style.

47-year-old model Yasmin chopped off her long locks in favour of an edgy short style slicked back hair with an undercut.

Yasmin appears to be channeling a true 90s style- a look that most would fail to pull off.

But with her radiant and pillow soft skin, Yasmin pulls the look off with aplomb.

In fact the Iranian-British model could easily be confused with her daughter.

As well as the catwalk show that Amber featured in at Westfield, there was also lots of giveaways and competitions.

Many of the stores were giving away free drinks or products, with Topshop hosting a disco.

Fashion's Night Out is a global initiative, sponsored by Vogue and the CFDA.

It
 was launched back in 2009 as a means to encourage consumers to shop and
 support the fashion industry during the tough economic climate.

Dip dyeing is not for the faint hearted.

It can be much more bold so it's important to communicate with your stylist and colourist to perfect the look. 

Dark hair needs to be bleached first before applying the colour so this is not a look if you suffer from very dry hair.

The look can be maintained as you care for it at home â€“ this is vital step for ensuring longevity of the colour â€“ Iâ€™d personally recommend a Wella colour saver to keep that colour in top condition.
