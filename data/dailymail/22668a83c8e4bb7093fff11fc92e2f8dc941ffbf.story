Wayne Rooney remains the main man, for now at least. However, the days of being the overwhelming, dominant force of this England team may be over for good.

In 2006, a nation seemed to have a  collective manic episode over the state of Rooney’s metatarsal and when he arrived back at the World Cup camp in Baden-Baden having been cleared to play, he was reported to have said: ‘The big man is back in town.’

It doesn’t feel like that any more for England. He does appear to be on an upward curve of fitness and his performance on Friday night against Peru demonstrated that he will do his share of work for the team.

In doubt: Wayne Rooney is still England's main man but his days in that role could be numbered

Industrious: Against Peru, Rooney put in a good shift and worked hard for his team-mates without scoring

Early finish: Rooney was replaced by Raheem Sterling in the 66th minute of the game

But after the 3-0 win, Gary Lineker 
was moved to write on Twitter: ‘Headline from this game is ‘‘What does 
Roy do with Rooney?’’ Now Sturridge is lead striker, where does he play 
him, if at all. Good problem.’

Roy
 Hodgson himself is protective of the Manchester United striker while 
also dismissing the idea that there is something sacrosanct about 
Rooney’s place in this team.

‘I
 think it’s a bit sad that the country is so Wayne Rooney-obsessed,’ 
said Hodgson. ‘I don’t think Wayne sets himself up to be anything other
 than a very, very important member of the squad, someone who does his 
best and tries his best at all times.

‘As
 far as I’m concerned, talk about combinations doesn’t interest me. All I
 want is for Wayne Rooney to play well and for Daniel Sturridge to play 
well, to score goals and to create goals.

‘That’s
 what they’re in the team for and that’s what we work hard to help them 
to do as a team. But certainly we don’t have the same obsession with 
Wayne or Daniel.

‘We also 
think that people like Danny  Welbeck, Raheem Sterling, Ross  Barkley 
and Adam Lallana, they’re in there to help us play well and score goals,
 too. That’s what the squad’s about.

‘Obviously
 Daniel and Wayne would like to be the first two names on the list and 
to do that they’ll have to continue to do well.’

New crop: Roy Hodgson has earmarked Danny Welbeck as one of many players able to score for England

Next generation: Raheem Sterling has broken into the England squad after impressing for Liverpool

On the rise: Ross Barkley's form for Everton meant Roy Hodgson couldn't ignore him

In demand: Adam Lallana's starring role for Southampton has earned him a starting place for England

Lineker
 did later mitigate his tweet, adding: ‘Worth remembering this was 
Rooney’s first game for a while. He’s scored bags of goals for England 
and can play out of customary position.’

The
 reality is that Rooney, who missed the last three games of United’s 
season with a groin injury, is still likely to start in Manaus against 
Italy on June 14, though he must be aware that he is no longer seen as 
untouchable. Seasoned Rooney observers know that if he is not up to 
speed in the first 15 minutes of a match, he is not the kind of player 
to grow into his game.

Poland
 away during World Cup qualifying would be an example of when the 
England bench could have reasonably substituted him at half-time, rather
 than after 73 minutes.

In 
South Africa 2010, the possibility of dropping Rooney was raised but 
Fabio Capello would not countenance it. In his mind, England were so 
bereft of world-class players that to ditch one of the few was madness.

No chance: Fabio Capello wouldn't countenance dropping Rooney for England

Change of plan: Unlike past managers Hodgson may consider Rooney's place for England

The
 problem was that while his performances four years ago did not merit 
inclusion, the options were limited in Emile Heskey, Peter Crouch and  
Jermain Defoe, all of whom had good Premier League records without  
troubling the world’s best.

This
 time it feels there is greater flexibility, though the alternatives, 
in Sterling, Barkley and Lallana, are incredibly raw. This management 
team will be more focused on what works for the team rather than 
soft-pedalling the star names. One of the frustrations for Gary Neville,
 now Hodgson’s assistant, during the 2006 World Cup was Sven Goran 
Eriksson’s indulgence of players with the biggest reputations.

‘Sven
 was clearly worried about leaving out one of his big players, whether 
that was Beckham, Lampard, Gerrard or Owen’, wrote Neville in his 
autobiography. ‘But it had to be done if it would benefit the team, and I
 definitely believed it would help keep the side on their toes. But 
because we’d become so used to this first XI playing all the time, to 
leave out one of the stars had become a big deal.’

Ruthless: England coach Gary Neville has spoken about not playing the best players but the best team

Hodgson
 is clearly still considering the possibilities for Italy, saying there 
are ‘too many options’ in the front five positions to have settled on a 
team yet.

‘Obviously we have
 a fairly clear idea of what we want in the back positions,’ said the 
manager. ‘But once you get past Steven Gerrard in the midfield, there 
are five positions to fill and I think there are a lot of options 
there.’

Hodgson was 
irritated that the wave of enthusiasm for the likes of Barkley and 
Sterling came at the expense of Rooney on Friday night.

‘It’s
 a little bit infuriating to see players who come on in the last 10 or 
15 minutes, when the game is over and there are lots of spaces and the 
opposition are on their knees, compared to players who have had to go 
out for the first 15, 20 minutes of the game when the opponents are 100 
per cent fit, very, very determined to keep you at bay, throwing 
themselves into challenges and getting 10 men behind the ball.’

But
 that point could equally be turned into a positive. Bringing on 
Barkley, who was clearly keen to impress in his 10 minutes against Peru,
 could be an option for the final 20 minutes in the humidity and heat of
 Manaus.

The extra work 
Rooney must do, tracking back as a secondary striker, will come at a 
physiological cost in the heat and humidity of the Amazonian jungle. 
Taking him off would mean he would remain fresher for the games England 
really have to win, against Uruguay and Costa Rica.

Barkley
 for Rooney, along with Sterling for Welbeck, may just jolt the 
Italians and ensure they endure a  nervous final quarter of the match. 
No tired, drained defender would relish facing those two, fresh in the 
final minutes of a crucial game. Taking Hodgson at face value, that is 
an option he is prepared to consider. He purports not to understand the 
fuss about Rooney or players of the ilk of Gerrard.

On the up: Rooney missed the final three games of the season for United but his fitness isn't in doubt

‘I’m
 not focusing on one individual. I don’t come to press conferences 
thinking: “What am I going to say about Wayne Rooney or Steven Gerrard 
today?”

‘I think about: 
“What am I going to say about the game? What am I going to say about the
 team’s performance? And what am I going to say about any of the 11 
players”. For me, Steven and Wayne have never asked to be elevated to 
the position where they are now. They got there because they’re good 
footballers and they deserve to be there.

‘They
 know full well, as senior players with a lot of caps, there’s a bit 
more responsibility resting on their shoulders than for a Raheem 
Sterling or a Ross Barkley, who have hardly played a game. But they also
 know that I’m fully aware of that and that I don’t expect any more of 
them than what they can give.

‘I
 selected Rooney for his skills and I selected Gerrard for his skills. 
All I want is for them to bring those skills, that I see in a Manchester
 United shirt and Liverpool shirt, to an England shirt and if they do 
that I’m more than happy.’

The
 age of the individual appears to be over. If so, it is good news for 
England. And it is good news for Rooney, too. Released from unrealistic 
expectations, he may have his best World Cup yet.

Freedom: Hodgson's refusal to rely on individuals could result in Rooney finally hitting form for England in a World Cup

Yet to make a mark: The 28-year-old hasn't scored for England at a World Cup and time could be running out
