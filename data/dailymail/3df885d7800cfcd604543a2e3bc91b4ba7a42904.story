Flower thief: Wayne Mail, 49, arrives at Beverley Magistrates Court today ahead of his sentencing

Wayne Mail was proud of his garden and wanted to make it the best and brightest in the neighbourhood.

Unfortunately for his neighbours, the 49-year-old found his plants by stealing from their flower beds rather than buying them from the garden centre, a court heard.

He also helped himself to plants in public parks and on roundabouts.

Mail lived with his poorly and widowed mother and he was determined to transform their garden to cheer her up. However, he eventually ended up in court.

Marlene Stavers, a resident in the East Yorkshire village of Anlaby Common, became so concerned about her missing flowers she set mouse traps on the lawn and a CCTV camera to catch the crook. It worked and Mail was caught red-handed on camera.

He was seen casually strolling into the neighbour’s garden with a bag in his hand, stooping down, scooping up handfuls of her finest plants and walking off.

Police publicised the CCTV footage and Mail was quickly identified and arrested.

Today he appeared before Beverley Magistrates’ Court and was sentenced to an 18 month community order with supervision and ordered to pay £85 compensation and a £60 victim surcharge.

Mail previously admitted six offences of stealing flowers, one of attempted theft and receiving stolen goods.

PC Andy White, of Humberside Police, said: ‘He had a nice garden, but dozens of the plants had been stolen.

'We’ve investigated the theft of garden furniture and the odd garden ornament going missing, but this is the first time I’ve heard of plants taken like this.’

The police officer said: ‘He was stealing two or three plants at a time, usually from big displays in the hope a few missing plants wouldn’t be missed and would go unnoticed.

‘When he was arrested he was asked if there were any plants that shouldn’t be in his garden and he pulled out a box of plants. He was full of regret and admitted it was a stupid thing to do.’

Garden view: The home of Mail in Anlaby, Hull. The flower thief, who is a full-time carer for his mother, was said to have a history of drug and alcohol problems.

The officer added: ‘In one incident he was caught by the homeowner leaving in his car.

‘Knowing he was spotted in the car, he brought the flowers back and left the plastic bag of flowers on the floor before apologising and driving off.’

And even the equipment he used to make his garden beautiful during the three-year crime spree was not legitimate. Stolen goods included a garden strimmer and lawn mower.

A 62-year-old victim, who wished to remain anonymous, said outside court: ‘I wondered where he was getting all the flowers to do up his garden.

‘We assumed he’d been getting flowers from other jobs he was doing, but had no idea he was nicking them from floral displays and neighbours’ gardens. It seems so petty.

'His mother took pleasure from having a nice garden and by his actions he has deprived other people of the same pleasure he was trying to give his mother'

Steve Munro, defending

‘It’s not like anybody can see his garden from the road, it is hemmed in on every side by high walls, so his thefts are for his own selfish pleasure.’

Steve Munro, defending, said Mail felt ‘disgusted’ at what he had done and explained: ‘He stole the flowers to make the garden look nice for his ailing mother.

‘His mother took pleasure from having a nice garden and by his actions he has deprived other people of the same pleasure he was trying to give his mother.’

Mail, who is a full-time carer for his mother, was said to have a history of drug and alcohol problems.
