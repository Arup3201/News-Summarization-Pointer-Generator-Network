A Queensland school has sparked outrage from parents - and even criticism from the state's local government minister - after they banned students from doing handstands, cartwheels and other 'cheerleading-style' stunts.

Peregian Springs State School parents were advised in a recent school newsletter by deputy principal Sandy Cathcart that the activities were not allowed unless children were under supervision of a trained physical education teacher.

The move has caused a stir among the school community, with some parents saying it placed an unneccesary restriction on their children's play time.

Parents of Peregian Springs State School are outraged that the school has banned cartwheels, handstands and other gymnastic stuntsÂ 

According to 9News, parents are asking why Peregian Springs will not just let children to be children and let them continue doing what they had been doing for many years.

The Department of Education says it was up to the school to make individual decisions but Queensland's Local Government Minister David Crisafulli has criticised the school for imposing the ban.

'We believe in empowering the school and the principal to make those decisions, but I will say as an observation, when are we going to let kids just be kids?' he told 9News.

'When are we going to allow people to be able to just live their life as we have lived our lives for generations.'

In a further statement to parents, principal Gwen Sands said they made the decision after students were injured while doing 'cheerleading-style' stunts

But not all parents are unhappy with the decision.

Justin Dalbins' son attends the school and he has used social media to voice his support for the 'fantastic school'.

'There are many areas where it is concrete and we received a newsletter from the school this morning explaining that they had a few children who have already seriously hurt themselves doing these sort of things,' he wrote on Facebook.

Another parent Russ Krause said the school and its staff had his full support on the matter.

'The initiatives and programmes that [principal Gwen] Sands has implemented into Peregian Springs SS, not only for students but for parents and the wider school community as well, only serve to prove her commitment to teaching and learning excellence,' he said.

'Dr. Sands and her staff have our children's welfare and safety uppermost in their minds.'

The principal sent out a further statement to parents, saying the school had decided to impose the ban after some students were injured while doing 'cheerleading-style' stunts.
