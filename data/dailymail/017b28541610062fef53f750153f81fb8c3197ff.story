Controversial 'pick up artist' Julien Blanc has posted a domestic abuse chart on his Twitter page calling it a 'checklist' for 'how to make her stay'.

The diagram was originally designed by a domestic abuse charity to help women identify when they are being abused, and has sections entitled 'use male privilege' and 'use isolation'. 

The post, which has now been hidden online, came as  minister Lynne Featherstone urged Home Secretary Theresa May to ban Blanc from coming to Britain.

American-born Blanc runs £2,000-a-head 'dating seminars' for men and is due to come to the UK on November 21, but a petition calling for entry to be blocked has already reached topped 120,000 signatures

He is due to be in this country on November 21 to host a seminar on pick up techniques, but an online petition calling for him to be denied entry has already attracted 120,000 signatures.

American-born Blanc was forced to cut a visit to Australia short due to widespread protests at his dating techniques, which include choking women, threatening to commit suicide, injuring their pets and isolating them from friends.

Crime minister Ms Featherstone said: 'I am extremely concerned by the sexist and utterly abhorrent statements Julien Blanc has made about women. 

'If he was allowed to perform in the UK I have no doubt that cases of sexual harassment and intimidation would increase.

'Free speech is obviously hugely important, but with free speech comes responsibility. It is not appropriate to talk about choking girls under any circumstances.'

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has also called for Mr Blanc to be barred from the UK, saying his £2,000-a-head seminar is not 'conducive to public good'.

Mr Blanc has made a name for himself by being what he describes as an 'executive coach' at a company called Real Social Dynamics, which he calls an 'international leader in dating advice'.

It promises customers the chance to 'witness dating coaches attract beautiful women in live demonstrations'.

But videos and pictures of Blanc in action suggest he encourages men to harass women with the aim of having sex with them.

A video of one of his seminar in Japan shows him saying that 'white men... can do what you want' in Tokyo, suggesting that men grab women's heads and thrust them towards their crotch.

Sarah Green, from the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: 'His so-called pick up coaching promotes behaviour amounting to sexual harassment and sexual assault.

Crime minister Lynne Featherstone and shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper have both called on Teresa May to block Blanc from being allowed entry to the UK

'More broadly, he is part of a culture which trivialises abuse of women and racism. At worst this tells victims of abuse that what has happened to them doesn't matter, and gives potential abusers the nod that such behaviour will not be taken seriously.'

A Home Office spokesman said: 'All visa applications are considered on their individual merits in line with the immigration rules.

'The Home Secretary has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good.'
