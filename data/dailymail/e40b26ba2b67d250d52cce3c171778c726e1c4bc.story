Flies Undone: Former Foreign Secretary David Miliband, 47, was caught out while travelling on the London Underground last month

In one of his more unguarded moments, former foreign secretary David Miliband has been spotted taking a nap on the Tube.

Labour's Mr Miliband, 47, was caught out while travelling on the London Underground’s Piccadilly line at 3pm last month between Leicester Square and South Kensington.

Electrician Francis Janjua, 28, got on the train and sat opposite the MP for South Shields, who was reading a book - but minutes later he began snoozing with his trouser fly gaping open.

Mr Janjua, of west London, said: ‘Pretty much as soon as the train set off, he closed his book and put his head on his hand and dozed off.

'He was properly asleep, I reckon. I was laughing to myself about it anyway, until I noticed his fly was down - then it was just hilarious.’

Mr Miliband dozed in a priority seat designated for disabled people and those less able to stand, although the Tube was not busy at the time when he was travelling - at 3pm on a day last month.

He dozed until the train stopped at South Kensington, where he disembarked - without noticing his zipper was still undone.

Mr Janjua, who was travelling home 
from work, said: ‘I couldn't believe his fly was down. It kind of takes
the credibility away from him a little bit. But he's still got more 
credibility than his brother.’

Meanwhile Boris Johnson urged senior ministers to follow Mr Miliband’s example and use the Tube.

The London Mayor was a caller on 
Deputy PM Nick Clegg’s weekly radio phone-in today, and demanded top MPs
got out of their chauffeur-driven cars to experience life on public 
transport.

Mr Johnson said: ‘I just want to ask you
when are you going to get all those Government ministers out of their 
posh limos and onto public transport like everybody else?

‘How can we possibly expect Government to vote for increases in infrastructure spending which we need in this city and upgrading the Tube, which we all need, when they sit in their chauffeur-driven limousines - paid for by the taxpayer - rather than getting down on public transport with the rest of us? Nick, get them out of their limos! Boris, over and out.’

Mr Clegg, hosting his show on LBC 97.3, insisted the coalition had slashed spending on cars by around 70 per cent but backed the need for investment in infrastructure.

This week Welsh Secretary David Jones was branded ‘lazy’ and ‘shameful’ after he used a chauffeur-driven Jaguar to travel 100 metres from his office to Downing Street and then back again.

Mr Miliband was beaten to the post of Labour leader by his brother Ed, 43, in September 2010 and has since taken a far less public role in the party, as a backbench MP and business consultant.

He has made almost £1million on top of his MP's salary since losing the leadership election.

A spokesman for David Miliband told MailOnline today: 'David would like to thank everyone at TfL (Transport for London) for making his journey a pleasant and relaxing one.'
