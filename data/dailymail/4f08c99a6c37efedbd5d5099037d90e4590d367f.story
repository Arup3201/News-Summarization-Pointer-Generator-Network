With the launch of its first UK boutique just months away, British fans of American fashion brand J.Crew will no longer be forced to rely on its website for their fashion fix.

But while you won't have to go far to get your hands on the brand loved by Michelle Obama, Anna Wintour and Beyonce among others, you'll be paying through the nose for the privilege.

And it isn't just J.Crew that is charging British shoppers more than their American counterparts. Other US brands including Abercrombie & Fitch, Ralph Lauren and American Apparel are doing it too.

Expensive: Getting your J.Crew fashion fix in the UK costs up to 40 per cent more than it does in the USA

Fans: American Vogue editor Anna Wintour and First Lady Michelle Obama are fans of the over-charging brand

According to the Sunday Times, which commissioned the study, the result is that buying American brands in Britain costs up to 50 per cent more than it would in the US.

At J.Crew, for example, a women's Collection cashmere button-back sweater costs $259.12 (£169.80) if you're a customer in New York.

British buyers, however, pay £238.25 - a mark-up of a staggering 40 per cent.

Similarly, at American Apparel, you'll find a leather drawstring backpack on sale for £115 in the UK but just £89.18 in the US.

At Abercrombie & Fitch meanwhile, the brand's practice of charging British customers the same price in pounds that Americans pay in dollars has resulted in mark-ups of 50 per cent or more.

Shocking: Abercrombie & Fitch make UK buyers pay the dollar price but in pounds - a 50% mark-up

High price: Crocs Inc charge up to a third more for their rubber footwear on this side of the Atlantic

The Macey dress, for example, costs $98 (£64.22) at checkout on the brand's US website but sells for £98 including delivery on the British equivalent - a huge price hike of 53 per cent.

J.Crew say the higher costs take into account 'the inescapable fact that costs in the UK are significantly higher than in the US'.

But not everyone is convinced by their explanation, including Marc Gander, founder of the Consumer Action Group, who said: 'For some reason, American companies seem to think that the British public are able to pay a lot more than American consumers.

'It certainly seems very unfair. In this economic crisis some people are having a bad time but others are still prepared to pay more for designer brands - and the US is cashing in on that market.'
