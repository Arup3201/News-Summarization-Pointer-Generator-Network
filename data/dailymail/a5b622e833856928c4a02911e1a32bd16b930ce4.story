Mr Nasty: Marcello Marino keeps getting death threats because he was rude on Come Dine With Me. Pictured with his wife, Yaice

A Come Dine With Me contestant who gets death threats every time his episodes air has begged Channel 4 bosses to stop repeating the show.

Marcello Marino, a 44-year-old hairdresser, became an instant hate figure when he launched attacks on the other four contestants in 2011 - but has been plagued with abuse ever since.

Marino slated his rivals' appearances, telling Donna Grieve she looked like she had never taken a bath and that her main course of cod, mozarella and tomatoes 'looked like a sick bag'.

He insulted Chris Newbold's haircut, told Lydia Jones she looked a 'state' and told balding male contestant Anthony Wait he should 'wear a wig' and that he looked 'like a transvestite'.

Although he is recognised as one of the rudest contestants to ever grace the show, the messages he has received as a result have been far more vicious.

Livid viewers have told the father-of-three they want to punch him to death or break his legs, hope his salon has to close and called him a 'slimy toad'.

He has received thousands of hate messages in total - in the post, via text messages and on Twitter - and the threats have got so bad that he and his wife Yaice, 31, have had to call the police.

One message, sent to him on Facebook, warned: 'If I see you in the street I'm going to punch you until you are lying on the ground.'

An an anonymous text read: 'You are a cretin. I'd love to see you dead - you really are a slimy toad and if I ever see you in the street I'll sort you out.'

Marino said: 'I know I came across as rude but I don't deserve this every time it's on again.

Not quite the perfect host: Fellow contestant took offence at many of Marino's remarks towards them

'It's very upsetting to get so many people say they will kill me or break my legs. It's unbelievable people get so upset over a TV show.'

Marino's show was last aired 10 days ago, and he had to make another call to Kent Police, who have given him a crime reference number.

He believes the show has been repeated 'about 10 times' in total.

Come Dine With Me frequently gets more than two million viewers, and Marino has asked that they stop showing his episode.

Begging: Marino has asked Channel 4 to stop repeating the show as he fears for his life

'What will it take for them to stop showing the programme?' he said. 'Do I have to have my legs broken and end up in hospital - or even worse?

'The threats have been going on since January 2011 and every time the show is repeated I get new ones.

'I didn't sign up to this and I just want them to stop repeating the shows I was in.

'Every time it's on I go out and am always looking over my shoulder. 

'I asked C4 to stop putting it on because one day I'll be killed and it will be the show's fault.'

The channel appears to have no plans to do so however, with a spokesman saying: 'We were saddened to hear Marcello had been receiving threats as he was a great contributor on Come Dine with Me which is a fun and light-hearted show.

'The programme makers have been in touch with Marcello to offer support and advice and both we and the programme makers would urge any contributor receiving threats to contact the police immediately.' 

Marino, from Ramsgate, Kent, came last in the dinner party competition, after receiving 26 out of a possible 40 points from his dinner guests.

Builder Chris Newbold won the competition, taking home the £1,000 prize. 

Come Dine With Me has been running since 2005, and is currently into its 32nd series. Repeats are shown on Channel 4's channels almost every day. 

A spokesman for Kent Police confirmed officers visited Mr Marino last week, saying: 'Kent Police was called to an address (Marcello's home), to reports of harassment at 10.20am on September 1.

'Officers spoke to the informant to discuss the nature of the allegations and offered advice.'

ANTHONY WAIT: As soon as Marino got in the door he told Mr Wait he was 'disappointed' at the size of his home. He then refused to eat his starter of stuffed garlic mushrooms with black pudding and herbs because 'it might have hairs in it'. He also told the balding artist 'your hair looks a bit greasy - a nice wig would suit you', and asked him: 'Are you a transvestite? You look like it'.

LYDIA JONES: At Ms Jones' home the crimper told her she 'looked at state' and slagged her off 'for not doing her hair' before laying into her wardrobe saying she had 'no taste in clothes' and should 'buy some new ones'. He told her: 'I can't believe your taste in clothes - it's all different colours. I think she must have got it all very cheap in a charity shop.' He also told her: 'You have a beautiful face - it's a shame about your hair'.

CHRIS NEWBOLD: Marino told Mr Newbold he looked like 'Bob the Builder' and joked that he had left his trouser zip undone when he arrived at his hairdressing salon for the meal. He also told him 'What happened to your hair then? You've got a terrible haircut'.

DONNA GRIEVE: Ms Grieve the receptionist she 'looked a mess' and that she 'looked like she'd never had a bath'. he said her main course of cod with mozzarella and tomatoes looked 'like a sick bag'. He also said he was surprised she was doing three courses 'because she looks lazy' and, commenting on her shoes, said: 'I wouldn't touch them, they might smell.'
