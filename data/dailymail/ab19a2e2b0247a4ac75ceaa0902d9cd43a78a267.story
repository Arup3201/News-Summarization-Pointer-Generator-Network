Social media giants will be ordered by ministers to do more to combat online bullies after the death of teenager Tallulah Wilson

Social media giants will be ordered by ministers to do more to combat online bullies after the death of teenager Tallulah Wilson.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller will call in bosses from firms including Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr to tell them to deal with complaints more quickly and decisively.

She will also demand a united approach on how to deal with allegations of online abuse.

The move follows the appeal by Tallulah’s mother Sarah for social media networks to stop online ‘poison’.

She has spoken of the ‘toxic digital world’ her daughter, 15, was sucked into.

Tallulah, a talented ballerina, threw herself in front of a train last October after sharing self-harm images of herself on Tumblr, a micro-blogging site.

She had claimed she had ‘no future’ and one user had encouraged her to hang herself.

Social media networks will be told to look out for youngsters who talk about harming themselves and point them to bodies which can help.

They will also be expected to  suspend or delete accounts of repeat offenders and make it easier to  report problems.

Tomorrow, Mrs Miller and Home Secretary Theresa May will update the Prime Minister on progress being made to protect children on the web.

The Daily Mail has campaigned against online pornography and David Cameron has already pressured the industry into action by supporting a default filter against such images.

It is expected he will also back the campaign against online bullying.

On Saturday, the Mail revealed that police were investigating if Tallulah death’s was linked to that of a teenager who attended the same school and died in similar circumstances.

Schoolgirl: Tallulah was a pupil at the £11,000-a-year St Margaret¿s School in Hampstead, North-West London

Mary Stroman, 16, was briefly in the same year at St Marylebone School in Westminster, central London. She died nearly two weeks ago in Yarnbrook, Wiltshire, after being struck by a train on a level crossing.

A special conference of major social media companies will also be called by Mrs Miller in the next few weeks.

Officials admitted that Tallulah’s tragic death has ‘given the whole thing fresh urgency’.

A source said: ‘Some of the behaviour being seen online is deeply disturbing.

It would be completely unacceptable to threaten physical violence such as rape or murder during a face-to-face argument so why do people think it is acceptable online?

‘Behaviour that is unacceptable and even illegal in the offline world is exactly the same online.’

The source pointed out it took huge pressure before internet giants had agreed to filter out online porn.

The industry is planning a national campaign aimed at parents about keeping their children safe.

But despite fears about online risks, some Liberal Democrats will try to dilute measures at their spring conference with a motion that users should not have to ‘opt out’ of filters.
