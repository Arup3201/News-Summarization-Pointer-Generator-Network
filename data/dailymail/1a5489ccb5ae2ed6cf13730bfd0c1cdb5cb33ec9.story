Hero: Korean War Veteran Rubin Baum, 80, was killed while protecting his wife from a car that lost control on New York's Upper East Side on Saturday night

A two-time Purple Heart veteran was killed while protecting his wife from a car that spun onto the sidewalk along New York City's Park Avenue on Saturday night.

'He pushed me out of the way,' Denise Baum, 62, told the New York Daily News of her husband, 80-year-old Rubin Baum, who would be swept beneath the vehicle while she was thrown into a parked truck.

'I tried to lift the car. I was so ashamed. I couldn't lift it,' Mrs Baum said while biting back tears.

Ending a night out taking in a jazz performance nearby, the couple were attempting to hail a cab home on the Upper East Side when police say a black Mazda sedan ran a red light.

The vehicle immediately ploughed into a northbound Toyota sienna minivan carrying a Pakistani diplomat, who has not been named, spinning the Mazda out of control.

'I stepped out from the sidewalk ... I saw a black shiny car,' Mrs Baum recalled of that life-changing moment around 10.30pm.

'He sacrificed his for life for me. He really gave me a good shove. It was in a second, he saved my life,' she told the New York Post.

Despite receiving an injury to her leg, as well as a bruise to her forehead, her true horror set in when she looked over and saw her husband.

'He was pinned under the car,' she told the Daily News. 'I want to know who did this? Was he drunk? Was he on drugs?'

Both Mrs Baum and her husband, who had served as a medic in the Korean War, were transported to New York Cornell Hospital.

Mrs Baum was hospitalized in serious but stable condition with a leg injury, while her husband was pronounced dead on arrival.

Neither the 20-year-old driver of the Mazda nor the driver of the minivan has been charged, police told CBS New York, while their investigation remains ongoing.

Terry Hill, who worked near the corner of East 59th and Park Avenue and witnessed the scene, told the New York Post that the Mazda’s driver appeared to be 'shaken up' while adding that the couple’s son showed up to the scene crying.

'She jumped right up and saw her husband and said, "My husband! My husband! 
Somebody call my son!"' Mr Hill recalled.

Howard Hauptman, who had known Mr Baum for 35 years, described his family as 'devastated' by their loss, according to DNA Info, describing the man as ‘the nicest, sweetest man you could ever meet.’

‘He’d
do anything for you,’ he said of the life-long Giants football fan and 
season ticket holder who had been working as a real estate agent after a
career in the Garment District as a women’s clothing manufacturer.

‘This is a very horrific thing to happen,’ he said.
