A chip shop owner is selling what he claims is the ultimate Northern lunch - a pie stuffed with steak pudding, chips, mushy peas and gravy.

The 1ft-wide, £6.99 snack was invented by 54-year-old John Clarkson after he said Marks & Spencer's 'hoity-toity' fish-and-chips pie was too small.

Inspired by the up-market food chain, he is now serving his own heart-stopping dish at his shop in Preston, Lancashire, declaring: 'It’s all paninis and wraps for lunch these days. A man can’t go to work on a wrap!'

Meaty: John Clarkson of Preston, Lancashire, is selling what he claims to be the ultimate Northern lunch - a steak pudding, chips, mushy peas and gravy pie. The 1ft-wide dish is thought to contain 2,100 calories

Mr Clarkson, who previously made the 
world's largest Ferrero Rocher caked in batter, invented his pie after 
seeing a 'gastropub' dish launched by M&S in April.

The
 fish and chips pie claimed to be the world's first and included an 
all-butter shortcrust pastry with minted pea puree, cod chunks, chips 
and bechamel tartar sauce for £3.49.

But
 Mr Clarkson said the pie - which has 531 calories compared to his pie's
 estimated 2,100, more than the daily recommendation for women - was 'a 
bit hoity-toity'.

'You would need ten of them to fill you,' he said. 'This is proper Northern food.'

The
 pie being served at Mr Clarkson's Mister Eater's Eating Emporium 
centres on a steamed steak suet dish known as a rag pudding.

By the slice: Mr Clarkson intends for the £6.99 pie to be shared between two, but it could be scoffed solo

Mouth-watering: The huge pie centres around a steak suet pudding surrounded by chunky chips

The pudding is placed in the centre of
 the pie base and surrounded by chunky chips before a hefty dollop of 
mushy peas is spread on top.

The 1ft-wide creation is then topped with gravy before Mr Clarkson adds a pastry pie lid and puts it in the oven.

Because
 Mr Clarkson orders his rag puddings from a specialist supplier in 
Rochdale, Greater Manchester, customers must pre-order each pie before 
coming into the shop.

Layering up: Mr Clarkson then adds mushy peas and a generous portion of gravy until the base is full

Finished product: The pie is topped with mushy peas, gravy and a pastry lid before being put in the oven

Side order: The shop owner said customers can accompany their pie with whatever they want - even more chips

Large: Mr Clarkson said his customers were complaining about gastropub pies being the size of cupcakes

Mr Clarkson's pie contains a rag pudding, a traditional dish first eaten in Manchester and the surrounding region during the Industrial Revolution of the 1800s.

A former staple of chippy 
cuisine, the dish contains minced meat and onions which are wrapped in a suet pastry before being boiled or steamed.

Rag puddings were once 
cooked in a muslin cloth - a rag - which gave them a striking resemblance 
to a small pillow.

Nowadays they are similar in preparation and taste to more common steak and kidney puddings.

'This is the real deal,' he said. 'Customers have come in and asked me to do something because they said M&S's are like cupcakes. People want proper food so I did my own version.

'I always look to do things that nobody's done before, and nobody's ever done this.

'We’re showing people how 
it’s done. This is meant to feed two but if you could eat one to 
yourself go for it and give yourself a pat on the back if you finish.'

Mr Clarkson, who runs his shop with his wife Corinne, 39, is known for his food creations which he describes as ‘putting a twist on the ordinary’.

As well as battering Ferrero Rochers and mince pies at Christmas time, he has created ‘Spam doughnuts’ and what he claimed was the world’s tallest burger.

'We just want to put a smile on people’s faces,' he said.

No frills: John Clarkson created the dish after saying an M&S fish-and-chips pie (pictured) was too small

Tasty: The chip shop meal pie is only the latest of a string of creations by Mr Clarkson and his wife Corinne, 39

Finishing off: Customers who want to try the pie will have to order one from the chip shop in advance
