Jessica 'Asia' Steinhauser - Asia Carrera - was arrested in St George, Utah

A former porn star who wore a colander on her head for her driver's license photo was arrested in Utah after police say she drove her ten-year-old daughter to school while drunk.

Jessica 'Asia' Steinhauser - also known as  Asia Carrera or Asia Lemmon - was found asleep on a couch in the Washington County School District office after driving there with her daughter, according to a probable cause statement. 

Workers at the office were 'concerned' with her well-being and contacted the authorities around 2pm on March 5, Capt. Mike Giles with the St. George police told Daily Mail Online.

After St. George police officers arrived, they detected the odor of alcohol on her breath.

When she tried to leave the scene, officers conducted field sobriety tests, according to the Spectrum & Daily News.  

The mother-of-two failed the tests, so police administered a breathalyzer.

It recorded her blood alcohol content level at .254 per cent.

Utah law sets the limit at .08 per cent.  

Steinhauser, who also has a nine-year-old son, was charged with driving under the influence with a child.

An officer reported Steinhauser said she brought her daughter to the district office for testing.

She was booked into Purgatory Correctional Facility on $10,000 bail and was released after making the required bond payment. 

Capt. Giles said he'd heard rumors about Steinhauser's old job but he was 'not familiar with her or her past employment' and was unsure if the arresting officers were aware of her work history.

He indicated it was likely child protective services had been called.  

Steinhauser - who is also known as Asia Carrera or Asia Lemmon - worked in the porn industry for 12 years

Steinhauser, a native of New York City who attended Rutgers University in New Jersey and worked in the porn industry for 12 years from 1993 to 2005, has appeared in 425 adult films and directed three, according to IAFD. 

Her films include titles like Let's Play Doctor, Planet of the Babes, Sexual Misconduct, Wild Wild Chest and Superboobs.  

The porn legend is a self-proclaimed atheist and was the fourth person in the US to be photographed for her license with a pasta strainer on her head.

Members of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, sometimes called 'Pastafarians', have decided the colander is their official headgear. 

Steinhauser is a MENSA member, former NJ spelling champ and also played classical piano at Carnegie Hall

After taking the photo, she said: 'I'm a really proud, outspoken atheist.

'I am proud of Utah for allowing freedom of all religions in what is considered by many to be a one-religion state.' 

Steinhauser is a MENSA member, former New Jersey spelling champ and also played classical piano at Carnegie Hall, according to her bio. 

Her favorite quote is: 'Hi, I'm just here to use the shower. Mine's broken.' 

She faces up to a year in jail if convicted, according to Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
