Clint Dempsey and his fellow USA stars clealy made an impression with their World Cup heroics as they scooped the award for best moment at the star-studded ESPYS in Los Angeles.

Cristiano Ronaldo won best international athlete in the Excellence in Sports Porformance Yearly awards, while the event was attended by a host of other sports stars including Floyd Mayweather and Maria Sharapova.

NBA forward Kevin Durant won two ESPY Awards, including male athlete of the year, and mixed martial arts star Ronda Rousey earned female athlete honors, becoming the first UFC fighter to claim a trophy in the biggest category at the show honoring the year's best performances on Wednesday.

The Oklahoma City small forward had his best NBA campaign, being named the MVP and even surpassing basketball icon Michael Jordan's record for most consecutive games with at least 25 points with 41.

The MMA star became the first female UFC Champion and the first representative of her sport to win the prize award at the ESPYS. Rousey defended her title twice this year against Sara McMann and Alexis Davis.

Durant also won best NBA player, ending LeBron James' two-year reign in both categories.

'Everybody
 helped me out along the way,' Durant said. 'My beautiful mom watching 
at home who couldn't be here. My favorite team-mate, Russell Westbrook.'

Durant beat fellow male athlete nominees Miguel Cabrera of baseball team the Detroit Tigers, Peyton Manning of the NFL's Denver Broncos and boxer Floyd Mayweather during the show hosted by rapper Drake at the Nokia Theatre.

Rousey, the first female UFC champion, won over WNBA star Maya Moore, Olympic champion skier Mikaela Shiffrin and college basketball player Brenna Stewart.

The winners in most categories were determined by fan voting.

Rousey didn't attend, with presenter Chrissy Teigen saying the fighter had surgery a day earlier.

Manning didn't go home empty-handed. He collected two trophies: best NFL player and record-breaking performance. Manning won his fifth Most Valuable Player award last season, when he set single-season records by passing for 55 touchdowns and more than 5,500 yards.

The Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks won best team. Their All-Pro cornerback, Richard Sherman, won breakthrough athlete.

The best game was the Iron Bowl college matchup between No 1 Alabama and No 4 Auburn, with the Tigers winning 34-28 on the final play to spoil the Tide's BCS hopes.

Gregg Popovich won best coach-manager for guiding the San Antonio Spurs to the NBA championship. Spurs player Kawhi Leonard earned the championship performance award to go with his MVP award from the NBA Finals.

Westbrook won best comeback athlete, having overcome his latest knee surgery to help the Thunder reach the Western Conference finals.

Stewart won best female college athlete, while Creighton basketball star Doug McDermott won male college athlete.

Olympic snowboarders Jamie Anderson and Sage Kotsenburg won best female and male Olympian. Kotsenburg won the first gold medal of the Sochi Games in men's snowboard slopestyle.

The Arthur Ashe Courage award went to St. Louis Rams draftee Michael Sam, who announced earlier this year that he is gay. The former Missouri defensive end will be trying to make the Rams' roster when training camp opens. If he does, Sam would be the NFL's first openly gay player.

Sam teared up throughout his speech and his voice faltered at times.

'Great things can happen when you have the courage to be yourself,' he told the audience.

Hall of Famer Jim Brown hugged Sam on his way to the stage.

The Ashe award is named for the late tennis player who died in 1993 after contracting AIDS from a blood transfusion.

The Jimmy V Award for Perseverance was given to ESPN 'SportsCenter' anchor Stuart Scott, who is fighting a recurrence of cancer first diagnosed seven years ago.

The Pat Tillman Award for Service was given for the first time to Josh Sweeney, a retired Marine who lost both his legs after an explosion in Afghanistan. He scored the lone goal for the U.S. sled hockey team that beat the Russians for gold earlier this year at the Paralympics in Sochi.
