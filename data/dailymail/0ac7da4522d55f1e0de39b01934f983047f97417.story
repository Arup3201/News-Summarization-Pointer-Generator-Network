Tottenham are set to table a £5million offer for Nottingham Forest defender Jamaal Lascelles by the end of the week.

The England Under-20 international is one of the hottest prospects outside the Barclays Premier League and has attracted interest from a host of top-flight clubs.

But Spurs will look to steal a march on their rivals in the race for Lascelles, 20, by formalising their interest this week.

Sportsmail understands the White Hart Lane club are prepared to loan Lascelles back to the City Ground if it helps seal a move.

Queens Park Rangers are also interested in Lascelles and have already had a £4million enquiry rebuffed.

Meanwhile, Spurs remain frustrated in their attempts to land Ben Davies from Swansea.

Manager Mauricio Pochettino wants the Wales international to replace Danny Rose as the club's first-choice left-back next season.

Tottenham thought they had a deal in place to land Davies 10 days ago, but Swansea have demanded £12million for the defender.
