A husky puppy broke out of her cage and saved a family of five after a suspected arson attack on their home.

The 10-month-old dog woke Mark Johnston by pawing at him and barking as he slept downstairs - before bounding up the stairs to alert his partner and three children.

A wheelie bin had been pushed up to the front door of the house in Breightmet, Bolton, Greater Manchester, at around 4am on Sunday and set on fire.

Mark Johnston (pictured with his partner Emma and their children McKenzie, left, Courtney, front middle, and Taylor, right) were asleep in their home when arsonists pushed a wheelie bin against their front door and set fire to it

The  husky, called Araya, forced her way out of her cage under the stairs as smoke was starting to creep under the front door.

Mr Johnston, who had been sleeping downstairs as he was due to leave early for work on Sunday morning, said: 'Without Araya, we would probably be dead.

'I was sound asleep and the door between me and the front door was shut so I was not going to wake up. She came in and was pawing at me and barking.

'Everyone was asleep upstairs so you dread to think what might have happened.'

Police say they are investigating the blaze after a wheelie bin was pushed against the front door and set alight. The burnt remains of the bin are pictured

After alerting 30-year-old Mr Johnston, Araya went upstairs to wake his partner Emma, 31, and the three children, Marshall, four, Taylor, seven, and McKenzie eight.

The couple's other daughter, 13-year-old Courtney, was staying with a friend.

Mr Johnston, who called 999 after being woken, used a wet cloth to open the front door, and was met by flames shooting up around the door frame.

He said: 'As I was calling the fire brigade, Araya ran upstairs to get the others up.

'The smoke was coming through the door and she has somehow got out of the cage. She must have bent it a lot to force it open.

'Dogs can sense danger, and that must have been what has happened.'

The couple had only had the puppy for a week before the blaze.

After the family fled from the home, Mr Johnston was taken to hospital as a precaution after suffering smoke inhalation. Nobody else was hurt.

The couple's other dog, nine-year-old rottweiler Tyson, was sleeping behind a closed door in the kitchen.

A fire service spokesman said: 'The fire came from a wheelie bin pushed up to the front door.'

Police say an arson investigation is underway.
