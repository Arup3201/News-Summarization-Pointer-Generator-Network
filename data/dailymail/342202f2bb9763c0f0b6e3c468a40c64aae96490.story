Nearly 50 people have been killed after in a powerful bomb blast at a packed Shia mosque in Pakistan moments after Friday prayers.

Police said the blast was caused by either a suicide bomber or an explosive device which went off when the mosque was at its most crowded on Friday afternoon in the centre of Shikarpur, which around 300 miles north of Karachi.

Officials confirmed the death toll from a deadly blast at the mosque is currently 49.

Saeed Ahmed Mangnejo, head of the regional civil administration, told Reuters that the death toll had reached 49. 

Hadi Bakhsh Zardari, the deputy commissioner of Shikarpur district where the blast hit, added 31 wounded are still in hospitals in the area. 

Shikarpur police chief Saqib Ismail Memon said: 'We are trying to ascertain the nature of the blast. A bomb disposal squad is examining the scene.'

Jundullah, a splinter group of Pakistan's Taliban which last
year pledged support for Islamic State, claimed responsibility.

'Our target was the Shia mosque. They are our enemies, said Fahad Marwat, a Jundullah spokesman. 

Another member, Ahmed Marwat told AFP: 'We claim responsibility for attack on Shiites in Shikarpur very happily.'

The majority of the world's Muslims are Sunni, and the schism with Shi'ite Islam dates back to a 7th century dispute over who should succeed the Prophet Mohammed. 

Pakistan has suffered a rising tide of sectarian violence in recent years, most of it perpetrated by radical Sunni Islamist groups against minority Shi'ite Muslims, whom they consider infidels.

Earlier this month, six people were killed and 17 wounded by
a suicide bomber outside a Shi'ite mosque in the city of
Rawalpindi, also after Friday prayers. 

In chaotic scenes that followed the blast, part of the
mosque collapsed after the explosion, burying some of the
wounded under rubble.

Reports said bystanders pulled people from the debris
and piled them into cars to go to hospital.

Locals said there were not enough ambulances and the army
later sent additional vehicles to transport people to hospitals.

The atmosphere was tense in Shikarpur after the explosion,
with shops boarded up and crowds of emotional residents massing
outside hospitals.

Pariyal Marri, a local resident, said: 'The entire city is in lockdown and there is tension in the
air. There is a heavy police presence and the Rangers are
patrolling the city.'  

Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen, a Shi'ite organisation, has
called for a province-wide strike tomorrow in protest.

Sain Rakhio Merani, a regional police official, said the
blast was probably caused by a bomb, although Pakistani
television quoted some residents as saying they saw a man
wearing a suicide vest.

Officials said the death toll is currently 49 while a further 31 wounded are still in hospitals in the area

The attack came as Pakistan tries to adopt new measures to
tackle Islamist extremists following a massacre of 134 children
last month at an army-run school in the northwestern city of
Peshawar.

The government has pledged to crack down on all militant
groups, reintroduce the death penalty, set up military courts to
speed convictions and widen its military campaign in lawless
tribal areas.

Yet Pakistan's religious minorities, among them Ahmadis,
Christians and Hindus, say the government is doing little to
alleviate their daily struggle against humiliation,
discrimination and violence.

Shi'ites make up about a fifth of Pakistan's mainly Sunni
population of around 180 million. 

More than 800 Shi'ites have
been killed in attacks since the beginning of 2012, according to
Human Rights Watch.
