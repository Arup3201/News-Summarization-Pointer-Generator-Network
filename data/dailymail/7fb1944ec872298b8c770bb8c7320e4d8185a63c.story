The Australian DJs who made a prank call to the Duchess of Cambridge's hospital will not face any charges despite the apparent suicide of the nurse who took the call.

The Crown Prosecution Service said there was no evidence to support a manslaughter charge against DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian, who posed as the Queen and Prince of Wales to call  the King Edward VII's hospital in central London when Kate was being treated for a rare form of pregnancy sickness.

Nurse Jacintha Saldanha, who transferred them to a colleague who then described Kate's condition in detail, was found hanged a few days after the incident.

Following a global backlash against the two hoaxers the case was investigated but Malcolm McHaffie, deputy head of special crime at the CPS, said any potential prosecution would not be in the public interest.

No charges will be brought against Australian DJs Mel
Greig and Michael Christian over hoax calls to the hospital treating the
Duchess of Cambridge, the Crown Prosecution Service said today

He said: 'As is 
well known, on December 4 2012 Mel Greig and Michael Christian, both 
radio presenters in Australia, made a telephone call to the King Edward 
VII's Hospital in London, where the Duchess of Cambridge was receiving 
treatment, in which they pretended to be members of the Royal Family.

'During the 
course of the call, private information about the Duchess's health was 
given, in good faith, to Ms Greig and Mr Christian and the call was 
later played on a radio station in Australia.

'Subsequently, 
Jacintha Saldanha, a nurse at the hospital who had initially taken the 
call but who had not herself passed on the information, tragically took 
her own life.'

He said Scotland
Yard provided the CPS with a file of evidence on December 19 and asked 
advice on whether a prosecution should be brought.

'Having 
carefully reviewed the evidence currently available, we have concluded 
that there is no evidence to support a charge of manslaughter and that, 
although there is some evidence to warrant further investigation of 
offences under the Data Protection Act 1998, the Malicious 
Communications Act 1988 and the Communications Act 2003, no further 
investigation is required because any potential prosecution would not be
in the public interest,' he said.

Mr McHaffie said
the CPS had taken into account, among other matters, that it is not 
possible to extradite people from Australia on the potential offences in
question.

He also said it considered that 'however misguided, the telephone call was intended as a harmless prank'.

'The consequences in this case were very sad. We send our sincere condolences to Jacintha Saldanha's family.'

The Australian was this week permanently  taken off air this week - but the two presenters will be given other roles at the station.

Mel Greig and Michael Christian of 
2Day FM in Sydney went into hiding and received death threats following 
the phone call last month to King Edward VII Hospital in Marylebone, 
central London.

Their Hot 30
show has been axed, but the presenters are still employed - and network
Austereo is looking at them ‘returning to work when the time is right, 
in roles that make full use of their talents’.

Jacintha
Saldanha, 46, of Bristol, the nurse who transferred the call to Kate’s 
ward, was found dead in nurses’ housing three days later, prompting a 
huge backlash against Miss Greig and Mr Christian.

Austereo is today launching a new 
programme called The Bump, in place of Hot 30, which will be hosted by 
presenter Angus O'Loughlin, but Miss Greig and Mr Christian are still on
leave.

‘We look forward to
Mel and MC returning to work when the time is right, in roles that make
full use of their talents,’ Austereo chief executive Rhys Holleran told
Agence France-Presse.

He added that the network will discuss future roles with the presenters ‘when they are ready’.

Miss Greig and Mr Christian posed as the Queen and Prince Charles in the call, which led Austereo to suspend prank calls by all of its radio stations and saw both presenters make a tearful apology on TV for their actions.

Ms Saldanha's grieving husband and two teenage children clutched each other last month as they gathered with hundreds of mourners in a small town in India for her funeral.

Miss Greig said in an interview after the death: 'There’s not a minute that goes by that we don’t think about her family and what they must be going through.'

The DJs spoke of their grief soon after the prank call saying they were 'gutted, shattered and heartbroken'.

In two emotional and often tearful interviews, Mel Greig and Michael Christian offered their apologies to the family of Jacintha Saldanha, but insisted that it had been a 'harmless prank' and that no one could have foreseen the tragedy.

Recounting the phone call in which another member of staff broke the news about the nurse's death, sobbing Miss Greig, 30, said: 'I remember my first question was, “Was she a mother?” ... It was the worst phone call I have ever had in my life.

'There's not a minute that goes by that we don't think about her family and what they must be going through.

And the thought we may have played a part in that is gut-wrenching.'

Mr Christian, 25, who had joined the Sydney-based radio station only weeks earlier, said: 'Our deepest sympathies are with the family and friends of all those affected.

Obviously Mel and myself are incredibly sorry for the situation and what's happened.

'We hope that they [Mrs Saldanha's family] are doing OK and they're getting the love and support that they deserve and need right now.'

Mr Christian and Miss Greig were also believed to have been given bodyguards following the backlash to their prank.
