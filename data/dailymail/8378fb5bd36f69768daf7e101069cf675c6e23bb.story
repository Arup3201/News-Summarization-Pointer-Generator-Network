Many a fan enjoys watching the tennis while sipping tea poured from a Thermos flask.

But now terrorism fears have ended even this most innocent of Wimbledon activities.

Security guards are confiscating flasks during compulsory bag searches at the entrance gates.

Tea-less at tennis: Wimbledon fans have been forced to leave their tea at the gate after a new ban on Thermos flasks has been enforced

Fans who arrived unaware of the crackdown were forced to leave their flasks at left luggage areas in the car parks – for a £5 fee.

Simply handing the flask to security and returning later to pick it up is not an option as the flask will be thrown away.

Spectators called the ban outrageous, particularly because cups of tea and coffee on sale inside the club cost £3.

One G4S guard told an irate woman made to surrender her flask that the ban was being enforced because of last year’s atrocity at the Boston Marathon, where a pressure cooker in a rucksack was used as an explosive that killed three and injured 176.

Safety measure: Thermos flasks have been banned in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings

There are fears that thermos flasks - or vacuum flasks – could also be turned into bombs if packed with explosives.

At one entrance to Wimbledon yesterday, security staff had confiscated a dozen flasks by midday.

A guard said that while the ban was introduced last year, security had been briefed to rigorously enforce it at this year’s championships.

As well as the risk of terrorism, there were also concerns that disruptive fans might lob them onto courts during play, he said.

But  Caroline Fiennes, philanthropy advisor and author, said: ‘I queued on Monday, as I have in about four previous years, and I’ve always thought it rather delightful that one can take in food and drink.

‘I’ve always taken a flask of tea but this year you can’t take them in, so I had to check mine in the left luggage before security - tea and all. Disaster.

‘If you look at their hilarious leaflet about ‘the queue’, the list of banned items includes Thermos flasks, but not hard-sided bottles of water.

‘Honestly, what injury can you cause a player with a thermos that you couldn’t cause with a Sigg bottle? Of course Brits want to bring tea.’

Novelist Tim Lott wrote on Twitter: ‘Wimbledon security guards confiscated my coffee thermos.

‘I fought for my rights but they were steely eyed and relentless #thirsty #Wimbledon’

And Lara Soetekouw posted: ‘Can’t serve yourself some hot tea while watching the games? Outrageous! #Wimbledon.’

As anger grew, one local cafe helped thirsty fans by offering free cups of coffee in Wimbledon.

Cafe Pod said on Twitter: ‘Thermos flasks banned from #Wimbledon. Need a pre-Tennis fix? We’ll be serving #FREE #coffee in #SW19 this fortnight!’

Spectators cannot leave thermos flasks at the gate and collect them later. Any that are left will be thrown out.

However, they have the option to take them to left luggage areas near car parks around the club for a £5 charge.

Tradition: Several fans have protested against the new ban, lamenting not having a hot drink while watching the tennis

Cool boxes and camping chairs are also banned but bottles of wine and spirits and up to two beers are allowed.

Other items spectators are banned from bringing include bags exceeding 16’ by 12’ and items which may be interpreted as a ‘potential weapon’ including knives, large corkscrews and ‘personal protection’ sprays.

Clothing bearing political statements or commercial identification intended for ‘ambush marketing’ are also forbidden, as are banners, rattles, klaxons and oversized hats.

Alex Salmond flouted an additional All England Club rule which forbid flags more than 2ft by 2ft when he unfurled a Scottish Saltire in the Royal Box on Centre Court after Andy Murray’s historic win last year.

The Scottish First Minister was accused of staging a political stunt by smuggling the flag in his wife’s handbag before waving around behind David Cameron’s head as he celebrated the victory.

He later insisted no-one sticks to the rule banning large flags around Centre Court, and after waiting 117 years for a Scot to win the men’s singles ‘a few Saltires hoisted over Wimbledon doesn’t really harm at all’.

A Wimbledon spokesman said: ‘We try to ensure that visitors know in advance our conditions of entry which are widely publicised.’

Emotional: Marion Bartoli was visibly moved on the court Tuesday

Reigning Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli wept as she stepped out on Centre Court for the first time since lifting the trophy last summer.

The French tennis star, who has since been forced to retire due to a shoulder injury, became emotional after she received a standing ovation from the crowd.

It was all the more poignant because she was taking part in a commemorative coin toss in honour of Elena Baltacha, a former British number one, who died of liver cancer last month aged 30.

The 29-year-old wiped away tears before she performed the toss with Elle Robus-Miller, a nine-year-old pupil at The Elena Baltacha Academy of Tennis, in Ipswich.

She later apologised for her tears, tweeting: ‘I’m sorry I got so emotional. I couldn’t hold my tears being on the Centre Court & supporting #rally4bally,’ referring to Baltacha’s charity.

Last year, Miss Bartoli was the victim of sexist remarks by BBC commentator John Inverdale, who suggested she had become so successful because she was ‘never going to be a looker’.

However, the pair worked together at the French Open last month and she proved she had put the comments behind her by sitting on the BBC sofa yesterday to give her verdict on her fellow players.

Asked about the episode earlier in the week, she laughed and said she had a ‘very short memory’, adding: ‘Last year for me it was all about winning Wimbledon.’

In the Royal Box yesterday, there was a face-off in the moustache stakes. Sir Bruce Forsyth, seen above with Strictly co-host Tess Daly, was preened to perfection but he was eclipsed by a rather dastardly looking Hugh Jackman, who is playing Blackbeard in a new movie.
