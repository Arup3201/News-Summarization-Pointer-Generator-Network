Tyson Foods announced on Wednesday that they will be improving their animal care policies after shocking undercover footage of abuse at a supplying pig farm surfaced from an animal rights group.

Tyson food sent out letters on Wednesday to farms requiring that they stop employing 'blunt force euthanasia' as a means of killing piglets. They also told farms to use 'pain mitigation techniques' when castrating the piglets and when removing a part of the tail.

NBC reports that Tyson wrote in their letter that they understood how using blunt force to kill pigs 'has been historically acceptable' for some time in the meat industry but may not match the expectations of today’s customers or consumers.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO -- WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT

Horrible: This man violently shakes an innocent piglet

Pregnant and abused: This pig is too fat to move, so workers kick it down the walkway

Even though the letter strongly encourages that all farms end blunt force euthanasia, the only farms forced to adhere to the new policies are farms that have contracts with Tyson and where Tyson owns some of the animals. Farms not under contact can choose to apply the new standards or not to.

'We’re trying to balance the expectations of consumers with the realities of today’s hog farming business,' said the letter signed by a senior vice president and the vice president who runs the company’s Animal Well-Being Programs.

'We look forward to working with you on our current challenges,' it said.

The Executive Director of the animal rights group who filmed the video, Nathan Runkle was encouraged and appreciative of Tyson's efforts.

'The announcement that Tyson is making significant animal welfare improvements, including urging its pork producers to move away from inherently cruel and restrictive gestation crates, signals an important new era and direction for the company,' said Runkle.

'We urge Tyson to add more teeth to the new guidelines by making them a mandate for all of its pork producers, rather than a mere recommendation.'

The appalling video
 aired by NBC in November was shot at West Coast Farms between September and October by an 
activist with Mercy for Animals and shows pigs being punched, kicked, 
smashed into concrete and locked in cages so small they can’t even move.

The undercover worker who shot the video named 'Pete' told NBC news that the abuse was 'commonplace' at the farm.

West Coast Farms, in Oklahoma, supplied meat for Tyson, according to Mercy for Animals. Tyson severed all ties after the video was made public.

‘We’re extremely disappointed by the mistreatment shown in the video and will not tolerate this kind of animal mishandling,’ a Tyson spokesperson told The Daily Dot following the incident.

‘We are immediately terminating our contract with this farmer and will take possession of the animals remaining on the farm,’ he added.

No anesthesia provided: Piglets have their tails cut and testicles removed without the benefit of any medication to dull the pain

Appaling: This worker sits on the pig, repeatedly punching it

No big deal: A former hog farm worker commented on Reddit that the pigs don't even feel the punches

Despicable: This piglet is kicked by an out-of-control farmhand

Over the top: It is not uncommon for animals to be hit, the former farmhand said, but it usually never approaches this level of violence

Farm owner Lonnie Herring reportedly fired all employees involved in the video, but their faces were often obscured from sight.

The
 disturbing footage begins with a montage of animals being hit with 
wooden boards, kicked, beaten and lying in pools of blood or locked in 
cages.

The deplorable physical abuse didn’t just stop at kicking and punching the defenseless pigs.

Piglets
 also endured being violently shaken, thrown through the air only to be 
spiked on to the concrete floor like footballs or even held by the tail 
and swung repeatedly into the floor.

A walkway is shown with several bloody piglets on the ground having seizures or writhing in agony, blood is splattered everywhere.

Multiple piglets have their tails removed either with a shovel swung violently down on the tail, severing it, or with a pair of shears – no painkillers are administered.

Another unfortunate piglet is also shown being held by their hind legs and having their testicles removed, again without painkillers or anesthesia.

The suffering causes it to let out a loud squeal and violently shake.

A pregnant pig too fat to move is kicked, punched and has clumps of hair ripped out.

Horrifying: This pig is still alive, but has begun to rot after being tossed on a pile of other dead pigs

Even live pigs are left to starve and rot amongst corpses

This is not right: Piglets writhe in agony after being slammed onto the concrete floor, some have seizures

Not uncommon, but being done wrong: Ill or infirm piglets are often slammed into the ground to instantly kill them, according to a former pig farm employee

One pig had a bowling ball thrown at its head, other had their eyes gouged out or their ears violently pulled.

Pigs barely clinging to life are tossed in piles of dead pigs, they start to rot even though they are still living.

A Reddit user who once worked on a hog farm commenting that the abuse shown in the video is far from uncommon, but that this farm took it too far.

‘Piglets are killed by having their heads smashed against the concrete because it’s quick and if done properly (which those guys aren’t doing) the piglets are dead before they even know what happened,’ said legless_kraig.

Close quarters: Pregnant pigs are kept in tightly-packed pens that provide no room to move

Waiting to die: The miserable pigs have nothing to live for, they are stripped of their dignity several times a day

Dead inside: The sad images show pigs suffering from depression, malnourishment and a host of other issues

‘Pulling by the ears to get them to move somewhere specific was common and kicking in the back end was too but realistically the pigs feel nothing from the kicking,’ he continued.

‘Gouging of the eyes was something that was done to the adult pigs when they weren't moving down the aisles or being stubborn and hard to handle,’ the Redditor further explained.

The pigs are miserable. They are mistreated, malnourished and then sent to slaughter – if they endure the torture long enough to be that lucky.

Most of the employees are miserable too, legless_kraig wrote.

‘It wasn't a job I felt proud of doing but I was young and needed a way to get money… that last year was a struggle every day to just drive to work.’

The owner of the farm, Lonnie Herring, said he was also shocked by the video.

'I was stunned that anyone could be that callous in their treatment of 
any animal,' said Lonnie Herring to NBC.

'After viewing the video, I 
immediately returned to my farm and terminated the employees seen in the
 video.'

Herring said that he used approved euthanasia methods he calls 'humane.' He also said workers are instructed to make sure an animal is dead before they leave it.

'It is a part of the business and there are prescribed methods of euthanasia and I follow those to a T,' said Herring.
