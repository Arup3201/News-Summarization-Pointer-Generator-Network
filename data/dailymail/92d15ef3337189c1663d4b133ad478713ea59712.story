An amateur photographer has used super speed cameras to capture the world's most iconic brand names and fictional characters by snapping them - in water droplets.

Arik Kfir, 45, a policeman from Beer-Sheva in Israeli began 'liquid drop art' in 2011 after he bought his first digital Canon camera.

Since he started his project, Mr Kfir has captured cartoon favourites like Bart Simpson, Popeye and Garfield with his extraordinary photographic technique.

Mr Kfir sets up his camera and flash rigs to capture the exact moment a droplet hits the surface, sometimes causing several drops to collide into each other.

By dropping the water in front of pictures of brands and cartoon characters, the droplets create a unique reflection of the images a fraction of a second before the drop bursts.

The process can be painstakingly slow and Mr Kfir often takes an entire day to capture just one perfect picture which he does from his kitchen.

He said: 'It is quite a complex thing to do and very hard as water droplets are tiny, but it is my hobby and I enjoy it.

'I set up in my kitchen by putting a full glass of water in the middle of the table, I then set up the camera in front of it before placing flash guns around and above the water.

'Next, I put an image behind the water, the image has to be upside down due to the reflection in the water.

'I then use an I.V bag, like you would find in a hospital, to hang above it and I wait for the water from that to drip into the glass of water below.

'Once it does, it is all about timing and speed, I use a remote control to take the picture and hopefully, if everything goes to plan, the end result is a sharp, in focus and well lit piece of liquid drop art.

'As I said, it is complex and it does take a lot of practice, but in my opinion it is worth it as I think the images look brilliant and are something different for others to admire.

The art of science: Albert Einstein captured in a water droplet. Right, The Pink Panther. The artist said: 'I do get lots of people asking if I can capture their favourite football team or even themselves'

'I love the colours in the cartoons I have photographed, they are what I like to see, bright colours. My wife doesn't mind me doing my projects in the kitchen, just as long as I keep it clean.

'I don't make any profit out of doing what I do, I simply do it for the love of art and I wouldn't have it any other way.

'I do get lots of people asking if I can capture their favourite football team or even themselves, which I don't mind doing.'

He added: 'They expect to pay for it but I don't see the point, it isn't much trouble for me so I either put them on my website or Facebook or just send it to them, it is no problem.

'I hope to continue my art and get better, it may give me a career after the police force but you never know, for now I am just enjoying it.

'I would advise anyone to get into it, I didn't think I would be able to do it but photography has made me see the world differently, it has given me a new outlook on life.'
