Rajendra Pachauri has stepped down amid claims he sexually harassed a woman working at his office in Delhi

The head of the UN climate change panel has stepped down amid claims he sexually harassed a woman working at his office in Delhi.

India's Rajendra Pachauri pulled out of a meeting in Kenya this week after Indian police started an investigation into the complaint from a 29-year-old researcher.

The 74-year-old, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since 2002, has denied the claims against him, according to a court order.

But today Mr Pachauri, who has also suffered cardiac problems, ended his 13 turbulent years in charge after announcing he was stepping down.

It has been reported that the woman claims the alleged harassment included unwanted emails, texts and phone messages. 

His second term as IPCC chair had been due to
end in October 2015.

In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Mr Pachauri
said that his inability to travel to Kenya showed he may be
unable to ensure the 'strong leadership and dedication of time
and full attention by the chair' needed by the panel.

'I have, therefore, taken the decision to step down from my
position as chair of the IPCC some months before completion of
my term,' he wrote.

He collected the Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of the IPCC in
2007, when the panel shared the award with former U.S. Vice
President Al Gore.

Findings by the IPCC about global warming are the main guide
for action by almost 200 governments which have agreed to work
out a deal in December 2015 to combat climate change.

 The panel
completed a set of mammoth reports last year.

The United Nations said the IPCC had appointed vice-chairIsmail El Gizouli as acting chair and would continue business asusual.

'The actions taken today will ensure that the IPCC's mission
to assess climate change continues without interruption,' Achim
Steiner, Executive Director of the United Nations Environment
Programme, which oversees the IPCC, said in a statement.

Mr Pachauri said he had considered retiring last year after the
IPCC completed a series of reports that raised the probability
that climate change is mainly man-made to at least 95 percent
from 90 percent in its previous study in 2007.

He weathered pressure to quit after an error in the 2007
report exaggerated the rate of melt of Himalayan glaciers. 

An
external review at the time recommended that IPCC chairs should
only serve one seven-year term.
