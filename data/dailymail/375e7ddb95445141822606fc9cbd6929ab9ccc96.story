With a triumphant smile, cerebral palsy sufferer Sophie Thomlinson shows how she can now stand on her own – thanks to Daily Mail readers.

The two-year-old was unable to walk but has strengthened her legs using a special bicycle and has progressed to take steps.

Readers raised £55,000 for Sophie after she was denied NHS funding for surgery to help her walk at the same trust which paid for aspiring glamour model Josie Cunningham's breast enlargement operation.

Proud smile: Sophie Thomlinson is now able to stand on her own thanks to the generosity of Daily Mail readers

Readers' funds enabled Sophie's family to buy the specially-adapted £1,200 bicycle to strengthen her legs ahead of the procedure, which they hope she will have in the US when she turns three next year.

While Sophie posed for pictures for the Mail, she suddenly stood up without help for the first time – causing her mother to burst into tears. 'I couldn't believe that she just did it,' said her mother Allison, 41, who is a nurse. 'It shows how well she's coming on.'

Sophie will still need the selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery to be able to walk freely. She was born prematurely with spastic diplegia – a form of cerebral palsy. 

Her mother said: 'We are just so pleased Sophie has been able to take a step. It has all stemmed from the bike. She's on it all the time and the more she's on it the more strength she's getting.

'That is good news for the operation because the stronger she is the better. Without the donations from readers we would never have been able to afford the bike so I can't say how grateful we are.'

Mother Allison, 41, and her husband Craig, 45, from Dukinfield, near Manchester, began fundraising last year

The family are trying to raise the remaining £17,000 to fund the cost of Sophie's surgery and therapy in the US

Mrs Thomlinson and her husband Craig, 45, from Dukinfield, near Manchester, began fundraising last year after they were told the NHS did not routinely fund the life-changing operation.

Thanks to the Mail, they raised the money required for surgery in the UK but then received another blow in May when they were told Sophie's condition was 'not severe enough yet' to meet the criteria in this country, despite being unable to walk.

They are trying to raise the remaining £17,000 to fund the cost of Sophie's surgery and therapy in the US. The family are fundraising through the charity Tree of Hope and any excess will go to help other disabled children.
