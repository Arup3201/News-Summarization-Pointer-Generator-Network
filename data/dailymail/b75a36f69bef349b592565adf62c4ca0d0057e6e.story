Ben Affleck has been banned from playing balckjack at a Las Vegas casino after allegedly being caught counting cards.

The 41-year-old actor was gambling at a high rollers table of the Hard Rock Casino, close to the Las Vegas strip, when he was allegedly confronted Tuesday night for being 'too good'.

Staff are said to have accused him of the tactic, which is not illegal but is a ground for being banned.

Claims: Ben Affleck, pictured on Tuesday night was barred from playing blackjack at the Hard Rock casino for allegedly counting cards

The
 father-of-three was in the Nevada city on vacation with his wife, Jennifer Garner, 
although it is not known whether she was with him at the time.

A source told MailOnline that Ben is still welcome to the hotel and was just banned from playing blackjack.

The insider said: 'Security said, "You are too good at the game."' The hotel was really nice about
 it and told him he could play other games. They ended up getting him 
and Jennifer a car back to their hotel too.'

Affleck was barred from play shortly after 10pm 'due to moving his money with the count,' according to an alert from a local security firm published by Radar.

A rep for the hotel made a statement on Friday, 'Mr. Affleck, a valued guest of Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, is not banned from our property and is welcome back any time,' according to Fox.

Meanwhile, the alert states that Affleck
 'uses perfect basic' - an industry term for card counting, 'but also 
takes insurance according to the count.'

It adds he: 'Uses black $100 cheques to keep track of the count while playing.'

Radar reports that an alert was sent to surrounding casinos in Sin City the following day declaring that Affleck was 'currently suspected of advantage play.'

The alleged ban comes after Affleck was warned on April 22 after he was suspected of using a similar strategy.

In a document acquired by Radar the Games Protection Manager at the Wynn and Encore casinos, Rob Olivetti, sent an internal email stating: 'Ben Affleck (the actor) … Was informed that he 
was being way too obvious moving his money with the count.

'He was 
spreading $100 -10K on the double decks and $0-20K (2@10K) on the shoe 
games. As of now, he is still being allowed to play per casino 
management.'

MaiOnline has contacted Affleck's reps for comment.

Surely he can afford it! The Argo star discovered a parking ticket on the windshield of his 1966 Chevy Chevelle SS 396

According to TMZ, the star is reported to have won $800,000 in 2001 at the Hard Rock by 'playing three $20,000 blackjack hands at once.'

But he hasn't always had the best of luck as Radar claims Affleck lost $400,000 to entertainment executive Ron Meyer during a private game.

Affleck is not only an avid gambler in real life but also on the silver screen as he played an online gambling mogul based in Costa Rica who is ultimately apprehended by the FBI for illegal activity in last year's thriller Runner Runner.

Meanwhile, on Friday the star was spotted back in Los Angeles where he was looking a bit dishevelled as he stepped out of a building only to find that he'd gotten a parking ticket.

Upon discovering the citation, the star grimaced before hopping into his his 1966 Chevy Chevelle SS 396.

Card counting is a controversial strategy in blackjack used to determine whether the next hand is likely to give a probable advantage to the player or the dealer.

While the practice, first outlined by American mathematician Dr. Edward Thorp in his seminal 1962 book Beat the Dealer, is not illegal, it is highly frowned upon in the gaming industry. Getting caught keeping a tally on card values could get you booted from Las Vegas, but in New Jersey's Atlantic City it is illegal for casinos to bar card counters. 

Gamblers who resort to counting cards in a bid to get an edge over the casino do so by keeping a running tally of all high and low valued cards seen by the player.

Card counting, or card reading as it is also known, allows players to bet more money with less risk when the count gives an advantage, like with a high concentration of aces and 10s in the deck.

It also minimizes losses when the count is unfavorable to the player, which happens when there are many low cards - 4s, 5s and 6s - in the deck, which benefits the house.

It is a common misconception that card counters must possess savant-like mental abilities or photographic memory like the character Raymond Babbitt portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in the movie Rain Man.

Instead of counting and memorizing each card, card counters assign a point score to each card they see that estimates the value of that card. The players then track the sum of these values by keeping a 'running count' - a tally.

Basic card counting, known as the Hi-Lo system, assigns a positive, negative, or zero value to each card value available.

When a card of that value is dealt, the count is adjusted by that card's counting value. Low cards increase the count as they increase the percentage of high cards in the remaining deck, while high cards decrease.

For example, the Hi-Lo system subtracts one for each dealt ten, Jack, Queen, King or Ace, and adds one for any value from 2 to 6. Values between 7 and 9 are assigned a value of zero and have no impact on the count.

The higher the count, the more players should bet because they have a greater chance of hitting a blackjack with many aces and 10s left in the deck.
