Tamer Mosallam escaped death on Memorial Day as five of his teenage friends were killed in a fiery California car crash that split the vehicle in half.

The 17-year-old was supposed to get picked up on Monday for a trip to the beach with his friends, but his father had other ideas and the carload of teens left him behind.

It would be the last time Tamer would see his friends alive.

The five teens, two boys and three girls, died late Monday afternoon in the wreck that left the car they were riding in split in two and engulfed in flames.

Tragedy: Five teens in California were killed after the car veered off the road and struck a tree

Sisters Christine, left, and Robin Cabrera were among the five teens killed in a fiery crash in California on Monday. They were both students at Irvine High School

Two of the other victims were Omar Soussan, left, and Cecilia Zamora

Among the victims were two of 
Mosallam's closest friends and a pair of sisters who had performed in a 
high school dance extravaganza over the holiday weekend.

'I was supposed to be with them in 
the car, that's why there were three girls,' Mosallam said, explaining 
that he was to have been the third boy for a three-way double date.

'They came to my house but my dad wouldn't let me go out because I was studying for a test.'

A visibly shaken Mosallam and several
dozen other students from Irvine Unified School District, where all the
victims were enrolled, gathered outside Irvine High School on Tuesday 
to try to make sense of the tragedy.

Police said speed was a factor in the single-car wreck on a busy, six-lane surface street and the investigation was ongoing.

The driver was identified as 17-year-old Abdulrahman Alyahyan, a senior at University High School.

The passengers included 17-year-old 
Robin Cabrera, a senior at Irvine High, and her 16-year-old sister 
Aurora, a sophomore at the same school.

Also killed in the Monday crash were Cecilia Zamora and Nozad Al Hamawendi, both 17-year-old juniors at Irvine High.

There was no class Tuesday because it
was a teacher development day but counselors would be on hand 
Wednesday, said Ian Hanigan, a spokesman for the Irvine Unified School 
District.

'There are simply no words to convey 
the sorrow felt by our students and staff, nor are there sufficient 
answers to explain the loss of five vibrant teenagers from our schools 
and this community,' Irvine Unified School District Superintendent Terry
Walker said in a statement.

The families of Zamora and Alyahyan 
declined to comment when reached by the media. Families of the other 
teens could not be reached for comment.

Friends who gathered Tuesday outside 
Irvine High said the five were headed to the beach for a fun Memorial 
Day when the tragedy unfolded on a busy thoroughfare that connects 
Orange County's interior network of freeways with the famed Pacific 
Coast Highway and its beaches.

Authorities said the wreck was one of
the worst in Newport Beach in recent memory and left two of the 
victims' bodies so damaged the coroner had to rely on fingerprints to 
identify them.

The car hit a tree in the median, shearing it of its bark and leaving deep gouges in the trunk.

The Cabrera sisters were both 
accomplished dancers in the school's dance program, friends said. They 
had performed in a three-day recital over Memorial Day weekend, said 
Brie Martinez, 15.

'(Aurora Cabrera) was kind of nervous for her dance but I heard she did really good,' said Martinez, as she began to cry.

'I saw something about the crash on the news last night, but I never would have guessed it was them,' she added.

Zamora was also in the dance program and performed over the weekend, said her friend, Paloma Douglas, a junior at the school.

Douglas last saw Zamora on Friday afternoon, when the two attended the same history class â€” the last course of their day.

'She was sitting next to me, so it's going to be tough seeing that empty seat,' said Douglas.

Friends said Alyahyan, the driver, 
was obsessed with his Infiniti sedan, given to him by his older brother,
and spent hours working on it and driving it around with his best 
friend, Al Hamawendi.

'Abdul loved cars. He took care of his car as if it was a human being,' said Ibrahim Razzak, a junior.

The two boys were inseparable and 
were part of a larger group of about 10 close friends who were either 
first- or second-generation immigrants from various Middle Eastern 
countries, said Zach Darwish, an 18-year-old senior at University High 
who was also close friends with the two boys.

The teens all spoke Arabic together when they hung out, which was constantly, he said.

Alyahyan came to Irvine from Saudi 
Arabia about three years ago, said Mohamad Abdul Razzak, a 16-year-old 
junior and close friend who also arrived in the U.S. last year from 
Lebanon.

He played excellent soccer, but wasn't on the school team, and planned to attend community college next fall.

Al Hamawendi came to Irvine two years ago with his family from Iraq, Abdul Razzak said.

He was obsessed with weight-lifting, worked out every day and had been on the wrestling team.

'We're all like one big group of 
friends. We all love each other, we're all like brothers. It seems like 
the circle has just broken apart,' Darwish said.

'I still can't believe this actually happened to good friends of mine,' he said. 'It's the worst news you can possibly get.'

The Infiniti sedan carrying the five 
people veered off a road around 5:20 p.m. and hit a tree, said Kathy 
Lowe, Newport Beach police spokeswoman. The impact split the car and it 
caught fire, she said.

'It
was a horrific accident,' Lowe said, adding that investigators were on 
scene for nearly 12 hours overnight. Speed was believed to be a factor 
in the wreck, she said.

'I've
been on duty for almost 30 years, and I've seen some terrible vehicular
accidents,' Newport fire Capt. Glenn White told the Los Angeles Times. 'This was, if not the worst, one of the worst I've ever seen.'

No other vehicles were involved in the crash.
