A funeral home worker was arrested in Washington state after police said he pretended to be a retired officer for two decades and recently intervened in a fight.

Authorities became aware of suspect Jim Bailey last month after he tried to break up a dispute between a couple in a car by identifying himself as a retired cop and telling a witness to call 911, Oak Harbor Police Chief Edgar Green said.

Liar: Authorities became aware of suspect Jim Bailey last month after he tried to break up a dispute between a couple in a car by identifying himself as a retired cop and telling a witness to call 911

An investigation determined the 69-year-old Bailey had been pretending to be a retired officer for more than 20 years, the chief said.

Impersonating a police officer is a gross misdemeanor in Washington.

'We're very proud of what we do and work very hard at what we do,' Green said. 'So to find someone who comes along and just takes that for granted and pretends to be one of us, that's upsetting.'

Green said Bailey gave himself away when he saw a couple fighting in their car at an intersection and stopped to help, telling them he was a 'retired cop.'

He was also wearing a shirt that identified him as an Oak Harbor officer when he was arrested.

Even longtime family friend Joan Waldron said she thought Bailey had been an officer.

'That's shocking to me because I thought he was somehow related to the police department,' she said of the arrest.

'He really seems to be from all accounts an outstanding citizen,' she added.

At least two other neighbors said they thought Bailey had been connected to law enforcement.

Bailey's attorney counters that Bailey never claimed to be a police officer, retired or otherwise.

Bailey's attorney says the situation is a misunderstanding and Bailey, who was arrested last week, is a good Samaritan who tried to help, KOMO reported Tuesday.

A message left Friday by The Associated Press for attorney Christon Skinner wasn't immediately returned.

Bailey has refused to respond to interview requests.

Bailey spent a few years as an Oak Harbor reserve officer in the late 1980s but did not graduate from the police academy or become an officer.

Green believes the deception may have been going on since 1991.

He may have even collected paychecks for providing training and lectures under the guise of being a former officer.

'It appears through our investigation this has been going on for a good 20 or 25 years or so,' Green told KOMO.
