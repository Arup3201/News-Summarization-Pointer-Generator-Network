A South Korean woman has turned an unusual online trend into hard cash, making more than £5,600 a month by livestreaming herself having dinner.

Park Seo-yeon, 34, has been able to quit her day job at a consultancy firm and instead focus all her energy on her daily meals on camera.

Tens of thousands watch her every day as she serves up disproportionately large meals in her Seoul flat and eats them, live, on a streaming site where she goes by the name The Diva.

Park can spend as long as three hours eating in front of the camera, and make an average $£5,660 a month from advertising and ‘donations’.

The donations, in the form of virtual ‘balloons’ – a South Korean version of BitCoins worth 100won each (about 9 U.S. cents) – can be exchanged for cash.

The trend, known as gastronomic voyeurism, has grown in recent months in a country which has one of the highest increase in single households in the world.

One-person households are set to increase from 25.3 per cent of the total in 2012 to 32.7 per cent in 2030, the fastest rate in the countries that make up the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, research papers show.

Online forums such as Reddit discuss the Korean ‘shame’ of eating alone, and the online food shows are a way for people living alone to get a sense of community when eating.

Park, who has been 
filming her show for three years, said: ‘People enjoy the vicarious 
pleasure when they can't eat this much or find that food at night or are
 on a diet.

‘Loneliness is 
another crucial factor,’ Park said. ‘The show is addictive as you can 
communicate with thousands of people at home.’

The
 bizarre craze is called mok-bang, a mash-up of the words 'dinner' and 
'broadcast', and it is thought to be more than 3,500 people running 
'live eating' shows.

Every night when the 'broadcast 
jockey' gets home from work, thousands of people log onto live-streaming
 site Afreeca TV for hours to watch her wolfing down enormous meals.

Her plates of choice range from two medium pizzas to 30 fried eggs and a box of crab legs, or five packets of instant noodles.

Serious business: More than 3,500 people in South Korea run online video blogs, streaming themselves having dinner, but The Diva is one of the most popular

Forever alone: One of the reasons behind the rising number of 'gastronomic voyeurism' streaming is that it leaves people living alone a sense of community

The Diva insisted she did not have an eating disorder, was not regurgitating her meals and had no health problems.

She added she began broadcasting her dinners because she was 'bored and needed a hobby'.

The Diva is just one of a host of people who have started broadcasting themselves eating over-the-top meals.

Another,
 BJ Lebi, devours plates of food the size of her head while answering 
questions from her fans, including how much she can eat and how often 
she uses the toilet, all live on air.

The videos have now swept onto YouTube, where they have several thousands views - more than 200,000 in one case.
