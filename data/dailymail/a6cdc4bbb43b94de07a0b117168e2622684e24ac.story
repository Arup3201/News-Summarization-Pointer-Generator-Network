A 28-year-old man shot and killed three members of a Southern California family before turning the gun on himself, authorities said Friday.

The four bodies were found late Thursday inside a home in a residential area of Pomona, police Lt. Michael Keltner said at a morning news conference.

The suspect lived at the home, and the murder-suicide appears to have stemmed from a domestic situation, Keltner said. MaryAnn Padilla, 25, her mother Manuela Padilla, 52, and brother Juan, 17, were each killed in their respective bedrooms.

Mother Manuela Padilla, 52, was also found killed in what the authorities believe was a murder-suicide

'This could have happened within 30 seconds easily, from one room to the next to the next,' Keltner told CBS Los Angeles.

Also discovered was the body of a suspect known as Raul, 28, who was dating MaryAnn.

'The suspect was found deceased from an apparent self inflicted 
gunshot wound and was found in the same room as his girlfriend. A 
handgun was recovered near the body of the suspect and is believed to be
 the murder weapon,' police said.

'Tough times, she was going to leave him, so maybe that triggered that,' neighbor Leonardo Pina told reporters.

April Mejia, the victim's sister, said she was shocked to find her family had been killed in a brutal shooting

Police believe the victim's boyfriend, Juan, had called to threaten the family earlier and had killed them after being told he was being dumped

The suspect was found at the foot of the younger woman's bed. There were no signs of a struggle.

Officers went to the house after Raul called relatives of the victims and said he was going to harm the family, police said.

Pomona is a city of about 150,000 people 30 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
