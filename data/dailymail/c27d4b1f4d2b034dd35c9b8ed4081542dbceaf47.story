For a man who had never used a computer until last year, Dan McIntosh has blazed an extraordinary path to becoming a Facebook sensation- all for his stunning photography showing off life in rural Australia. 

The outback cook has now launched a book titled 'Outback Stations' detailing what 'real' life is like in Australia, featuring photographs from the people who work and live in some of the toughest conditions in the country.

Dan, known affectionately as 'Cookie', has been feeding hungry workers in woolsheds and mustering camps for the past 30 years, and has spent much of his life as a wanderer in the Northern Territory.

His colourful and earthy life was something he was keen to share with his family and friends, and so the well-loved foodie started a Facebook page to post photographs of his life to.

'Never in a million years would you think that it would become a book. Just incredible. It's hard to believe,' said Dan.

'I’ve been a cook for nearly 36 years,' said Dan.

'It all started when I was 15. I was working in Queensland at a property called Kiagara. The old cook went out for a big night, got locked up in the jailhouse and never came back,' 

'So the job was in. I was only 15.' 

His colourful and earthy life was something he was keen to share with his family and friends, and so the well-loved foodie started a Facebook page to post photographs of his life to.

'I started taking photos 10 years ago. I’d send photos back home to my mum and dad, who wanted to know where I was and how I was going,' Dan told Daily Mail Australia.

The page quickly took off, surprising and delighting Dan as more and more people were keen to share their own photos and experiences of living in the outback. 

'I had 1000 followers after a week, 40,000 after three months. I have 114,863 followers at the moment from all over the world,' he said.

'City people also wouldn’t have any idea what it’s like living in the country. We live under a tin roof and sleep on the ground.'

The beautiful and raw photographs quickly drew the eye of Sydney-based publisher Brigitta Doyle, who was instantly riveted by the images on the Facebook page.

'It's incredible, so many Australians don’t know what it looks like. City people often don’t recognise that the photos are of Australia if you don’t tell them what it’s like,' said Dan

'I go out to rodeos and race meets and photograph the real people from the country.'

More than 32 million people have now viewed the site. Dan believes that part of the attraction is the fact that the page shows 'the true outback'.

'It's incredible, so many Australians don’t know what it looks like. City people often don’t recognise that the photos are of Australia if you don’t tell them what it’s like,'

'City people also wouldn’t have any idea what it’s like living in the country. We live under a tin roof and sleep on the ground.'

Thousands of others began adding their own photographs to the Facebook page, detailing what everyday life was like for them. 

The beautiful and raw photographs quickly drew the eye of Sydney-based publisher Brigitta Doyle, who was instantly riveted by the images on the Facebook page.

'They're just people sharing the parts of their day that make them happy or make them sad. And I think that's really powerful. I just thought Dan's really special, and what he is creating is really special,' she told ABC Landline. 

'They're just people sharing the parts of their day that make them happy or make them sad. And I think that's really powerful,' said Brigitta Doyle, the book's publisher

Outback Stations was released in September, and has taken off, with many Australians responding to the reality of outback Australian life as shown through the lens of those who live there.

As a pictorial celebration of the real outback, Dan said that he was determined not to edit the pictures digitally. 

'I don’t like doing all that photoshop stuff, I want to see the true photo. I don’t think photoshop can be better than the real thing,' he said. 

'I’ve had no photography training. Even the big camera I have now, I wouldn’t know what half the buttons do,'

'I press a button and if the photo has taken properly then I’m lucky!'

'I go out to rodeos and race meets and photograph the real people from the country.'

Dan said that one of the hardest part of putting the book together was choosing the right photographs to be included. 

'We made a competition for people to send photos in of their properties, so we could show off stations all around Australia’s outback,' said Dan.

For the hardworking cook, it has been a long road but an astoundingly quick success.

'Never in a million years would you think that it would become a book. Just incredible. It's hard to believe,' said Dan.
