An inquisitive six foot tall polar bear got a bit too close to a photographer for comfort as it posed for the camera.

Dafna Ben Nun came within inches of the predator as she took pictures of it in the wild and was only separated by a chain fence.

She said at first the animal was curious and came up to investigate what she was doing but rangers had to scare it away when it became too feisty.

Ms Ben Nun said rangers became concerned when the polar bear seemed to want to 'play-fight' with her through the fence.

She said: 'At first when the bear is lying down on the ground he seems like a big, cute dog.

'But when he suddenly stands up on his hind legs easily reaching two meters high, you really get the idea of how strong and powerful this animal is.

'This bear was trying to play-fight with us by pouncing on his front paws and the second the guides saw its behaviour they threw a stone at the bear's feet to scare him off and it did the job.

'If that didn't work they would use 
pepper spray. They also have a gun just in case and the loud sound would
 definitely scare the bear away.'

The photographs were captured at Dymond Lake Lodge in Kleefeld, Canada, in the heart of the bear's territory.

It is one of the few places people can get this close to the predators.

Ms Ben Nun, from Israel, said: 'The bears come up to the fence of the lodge and it is an amazing experience facing such a marvellous and deadly animal.

'They are very clever animals who are used to everyone running away from them, so when a human stands and won't move they become curious.'

Many the younger bears gather in Kleefeld to practice fight other young bears.

This helps them weigh up competition for serious battles later on in their lives.
