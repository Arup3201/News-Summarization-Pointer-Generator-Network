Former Olympic star Liz McColgan last night launched a furious broadside against her ‘controlling’ husband as she was cleared of assaulting him during their bitter separation.

The one-time world 10,000m champion was close to tears as she described enduring a ‘tough life’ with Peter McColgan, claiming he had subjected her to years of misery.

Her emotional outburst followed an extraordinary trial yesterday in which a court heard allegations that her jealous husband had spied on her email conversations after he suspected that she was conducting an affair.

Mr McColgan, a former international 
steeplechaser, even sent anonymous texts to his wife, her supposed lover
and the other man’s wife threatening to expose the alleged affair if it
did not stop.

He told Arbroath Sheriff Court that the estranged couple’s relationship 
broke down irrevocably after Mrs McColgan launched an attack on him in 
July in the family home in front of their terrified children before 
throwing his clothes out of an upstairs window.

However, a sheriff acquitted Mrs McColgan, 47, of assault after her 
lawyer painted a picture of her husband as a ‘shifty, conniving’ man 
whose evidence was neither reliable nor credible.

Speaking after the case, the Commonwealth gold medal winner said: 
‘This has been a really hard six months for my family, and I want to 
thank particularly my family and [defence lawyer] George Donnelly.

‘There’s a lot more to this story. I have had a very tough life with 
Peter McColgan. It has not been easy and nobody knows the true story. I 
am on the way to a new life now and totally free from someone who has 
tried to control everything that I’ve done. I’m so glad that the sheriff
saw sense today.’

She lambasted her husband for ‘hiding behind an assault charge when 
there are men out there who are actually sitting in that position with 
women that are beating them up’.

She added: ‘I think it’s so cruel of him to use such a lame excuse and 
to try and ruin me by pretending that there was an incident that 
happened in my house. My only regret is that my children will be 
affected by this. I’m a good mother on my way to a new life.’

Champion: Mrs McColgan won an Olympic silver and Commonwealth and World Championship golds

The court heard earlier that Mr McColgan, 48, called in police following
a row at the couple’s home in Angus in Scotland on July 12.

He said he suspected his wife, whom he married in 1987, of having an 
affair and he had consulted solicitors. On the morning in question, he 
said, she launched a tirade against him while their children, then aged 
six, nine, ten and 11, watched in horror.

He said: ‘She started just shouting about a solicitor’s letter that she 
had received and asking why had I done this and why was I selling the 
house. But before she had left she had said, “Stop fannying about – go 
and get a solicitor because it’s not going to work out”.

‘She started prodding me in the stomach and the next thing I remember 
was two punches to the side of my face.’ He claimed she then threw all 
his clothes out of their bedroom window. A charge relating to that 
alleged incident was dropped.

Earlier, Mr Donnelly asked Mr McColgan why he had used computer ‘spyware’ to secretly check on his wife’s email conversations.

He told the court: ‘I used it because I thought she was having an 
affair. I used it once and when I did my suspicions were verified when I
saw a conversation on Facebook in February 2010.’

Regarding the anonymous texts,  Mr Donnelly said: ‘Do you remember 
buying a mobile phone and SIM card in London and sending texts to your 
wife, the third party and the third party’s wife saying that you would 
disclose a so-called relationship to the Press?’

Mr McColgan replied: ‘No. I was trying to bring the affair to an end. I 
sent texts saying when is this going to end. There were no threats.’ 

Mrs McColgan won Commonwealth gold in 1986 and 1990 and Olympic silver 
in 1988. She also won gold at the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo.
