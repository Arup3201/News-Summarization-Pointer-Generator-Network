It has been on sale since 1965 and has become an automotive classic.

So, in recognition of the Ford Transit's 50th birthday next year, the vehicle has been given an 'ultra-premium' makeover.

The spruced-up Transit Skyliner Concept luxury van has been designed in a bid to vehicle's capability and flexibility, as well as the potential for using it as a means of high-end transport.

Travel in style: Ford have described the new luxury Transit as a 'private jet on wheels'

Luxurious interior: The new concept has a bar, hardwood floors and rotating, leather seats

Cinema: The digital system includes a 52-inch projection screen and surround sound

Described by Ford as a 'private jet on wheels,' the van's interior can be transformed to meet the different needs of its users, using a smartphone or tablet app.

The van boasts four different modes. The Theatre Mode has the vehicle's four reclining seats facing a 52-inch retractable Stewart projection screen.

The seats can be turned around to face each other for face-to-face conversation in its Business Mode.

A Reception Mode allows the sliding door to be opened right up to 4 ft (1.2 m) wide allowing for easy access and use for entertaining whilst parked at an event, and its Travel Mode allows passengers to adjust the seats and footrests for comfort and solitude.

At the wheel: the driver can also ride in comfort with a leather seat and spacious cabin

Touch of a button: The inside is controlled by an app which can change the layout to suit the passengers' comforts

Convenient: The back has luggage space and easy access to electronics containing the DVDs and Blue Ray discs

The van also has a built-in bar and custom luggage that matches the vehicle's leather-trimmed seats.

Outside, the Transit Skyliner features a custom silver metallic paint scheme with contrasting lower trim, chrome highlights and custom Forgiato wheels.

It is powered by a Transit 3.5-litre EcoBoost engine.
