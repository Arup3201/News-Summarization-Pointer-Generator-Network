Hope: Abigail Hernandez was in contact with her mother after her disappearance on October 9 according to investigators close to the case of the missing New Hampshire girl

Abigail Hernandez, the New Hampshire teenager missing since October is believed to have contacted her mother after police announced she had disappeared investigators announced today.

Hernandez, 15, of North Conway was last seen on October 9 after leaving Kennett High School on her way home, but the FBI now says dramatic new information has come to light that suggests she has been in contact with her mother since that date.

Since her disappearance, Hernandez's parents have made repeated public pleas for her safe return - even stating in a televised interview that they believe she got in a car with someone and that they believe she is in serious trouble.

While the investigation into Abigail Hernandez's disappearance seems to have drastically changed, the nature of the contact and how it was conducted have not been released by law enforcement.

Indeed, the FBI said at a press conference today that they discovered evidence of the contact between Abigail and her mother two weeks ago and that it dates from after her October 9 disappearance.

Federal investigators did not elaborate on what this means for Zenya Hernandez, her mother, or Abigail and more details are expected at a press conference on Friday at 11am.

'We don't know that she is well or safe by any means,' said FBI special agent Kieran Ramsey. 'In fact, we have grave concerns for her safety.'

Revelations: It has been revealed that Zenya Hernandez has been in contact with her daughter since her disappearance on October 9 - despite her previous statements

Incentive: The FBI is offering a $20,000 reward for information in the missing person case

All-American girl: Abby ran track at school and was described as quiet and bright

The girl’s mother said last month that she believes her daughter will come home someday.

Zenya Hernandez urged her daughter to be strong. Police have said they don’t know whether Abigail was involved in an accident, ran away or was abducted.

'I miss you and love you more than you can imagine,' Zenya Hernandez said in her note written on a yellow legal pad and dated November 22.  'I feel your absence every day. You belong home with me.'

In her letter, the missing girl’s mother said she believed Abby was alive, and she expressed hoped that her daughter would find a way to reach out to her.

‘Abby, you are a strong young woman and I am staying strong for you,’ Zenya Hernandez wrote. ‘You are courageous, you are smart, and you are beautiful.’

New Hampshire Assistant Attorney General Jane Young said investigators are still working the case and that it is important to keep Abby's picture in the media -- especially outside of the local area.

‘Abby, I keep having a dream where you come home and I give you the biggest hug ever,’ she wrote in her letter. ‘I know in my heart this dream means something and that it matters. I pray to God it will come true.’

The letter was signed, ' Love, Mom,' with a little heart drawn on the page.

Zenya Hernandez held a press conference in November at the Conway police station in New Hampshire where she pleaded for her daughter's safe return

During a press conference held last month in front of the Conway Police Department, Miss Hernandez addressed her daughter, saying she believed Abby was out there somewhere watching her right now.

In an interview with CBS Boston, Miss Hernandez said Abby usually took the bus home, but for some reason decided to walk October 9.

State and Conway police and the FBI have been inundated with hundreds of tips. The FBI is offering a $20,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in the case, Boston.com reported.

The last call made on a missing New Hampshire girl’s cellphone was October 9 about four hours after she was last seen, investigators said.

The last sighting of the girl, who ran on the track team for her school and was described as quiet and bright, was around 2.30pm.

Investigators believe Abigail made it back to her home, but when her mother came back from her nursing job, her daughter was gone.

The schoolgirl's 15th birthday was on October 12.

Police said they have not located the girl’s phone, but have determined that the last call was made at 6.30pm - about four hours after her last sighting.

It was used about two miles from her home at a spot near Cranmore Mountain - a popular local ski resort.

Since then local police and the FBI have searched on foot, in boats, and by helicopter but have failed to turn up any new evidence about the disappearance.

Abigail is 5ft 4in tall and weighs 118lb with brown hair and eyes. She was last seen wearing black stretch pants, tall brown boots and a grey sweater.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Conway police on 603-356-5715.
