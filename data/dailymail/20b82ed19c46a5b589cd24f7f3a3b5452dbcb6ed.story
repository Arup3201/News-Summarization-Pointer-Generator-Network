A central Florida mother is facing a child cruelty charge after police say she drove down a busy road with her teenage son clinging to the hood of her car.

According to Winter Springs police, an officer pulled over 43-year-old Tojuana Lowe last Thursday morning as she was traveling on State Road 434.

Lowe reportedly told that officer that her son had jumped on her vehicle to prevent her from leaving and that she drove away in an attempt to scare him, assuming he would jump off.

Bad move: Tojuana Lowe, 43, was charged with child cruelty after driving for a third of a mile along State Road 434 with her 16-year-old son on top of her Mazda 

Police say Lowe was traveling about 20 to 25 miles per hour and had made it nearly a third of a mile from their home before being stopped. No injuries were reported.

According to an arrest report obtained by Orlando Sentinel, Tojuana Lowe was stopped by a police officer at around 7.30am on January 8 after she was spotted driving with her 16-year-old son on her windshield.

The mother told the officer that her son jumped on top of her Mazda to prevent her from leaving their home at Moss Park Apartment sin Winter Springs.

'I tried to scare him by driving off with him on the car,' she reportedly told the officer.

There is no word at this time why the boy wanted to stop his mother from leaving.

Police said the 16-year-old at one point jumped off the car, but then immediately hopped back on, settling on the hood.

Dangerous route: State Road 434 is considered one the busiest thoroughfares in Seminole County

The mother stated that she was in the process of calling 911 when she saw a Winter Springs police officer and pulled over of her own accord to ask for help.

‘State Road 434 has a high volume of traffic flow and if Tojuna’s vehicle was involved in a traffic accident, [her son] could have sustained serious bodily injury,’ the arrest report stated.

Miss Lowe told the arresting officer she knew it was wrong to drive with her son clinging to the outside of the car.

Lowe was booked into the Seminole County jail and later released on $2,000 bail.
