It's a hard life, but someone's got to do it... A group of elephants relax and enjoy a day of pampering at a spa in India where workers scrub and massage them all day long.

July is a month of rejuvenation in India and it's not just humans who appreciate the chance to kick back and enjoy a spot of luxury, if this adorable video is anything to go by. 

The elephants are hosed down, scrubbed clean, massaged and fed nutritious snacks by a horde of workers, watched by an interested crowd.

Easy does it, jumbo: Four workers treat this lucky tusked giant who is clearly loving the attention

The animals, who form a major part of the regular processions associated with the nearby temple, are allowed a day off from their work duties to kick back.

Reclining lazily in the nearby river, they clearly love every minute of their 'treatments', lolling about while workers attend to their ritual pampering session.

 And as if that weren't enough, tasty - for an elephant anyway - and nutritious snacks are then fed to the elephants to aid in their 'rejuvenation'.

The spa days take place in Kerala every July and are a way for the workers to reward their loyal tuskers for taking part in the processions which are a part of daily life.

What, I can just lie here all day? The elephant spa can accommodate up to 59 elephants at a time

And after the bathing, the snacks begin: Elephant pamperers offer tasty nutritious foods to aid rejuvenation
