The owner of a boa constrictor that frightened a public relations office when it slithered out of their toilet last week has come forward to apologize and claim his snake, though it will be going to a new home. 

The five-foot-long Columbian rainbow didn't stray far from home by lodging itself in the toilet at Vertical PR in San Diego. The snake's owner lives two floors up in the same building on G Street.

The owner has not publicly identified himself, but has told the landlord and his neighbors that he assumed the snake escaped outside since his tank was near an open window. He had no idea it went elsewhere in the building. It's unknown how long the snake was missing, or if he reported it to animal control.

Terrifying: Last Tuesday, this 5-foot-long boa constrictor popped out of the toilet in this San Diego, California PR firm, giving the employees in the office quite a fright. The following day, the snake's owner called animal control to claim it 

Great neighbor: The snake's owner lived two floors up from Vertical PR in the same building in San Diego, California 

Feisty: The owner will be taking his Columbian rainbow boa to live at a friend's house. The snake has been aggressive while in animal control's custody, nipping one handler on the wrist 

Though he will face no consequences for the incident, the snake's owner has decided to relocate the boa to a new home.

'The tenant and I agreed the snake would be better at his friend’s house,' landlord Jason Zana told U-T San Diego. 'It was his idea first, and I agreed.'

Zana said his mixed-use building is pet friendly and that he never had a specific clause about snakes before. However, he says he's thinking of implementing a new rule in the aftermath of the terrifying incident.

The women at the PR firm have been incredibly understanding about the accident, despite the fright the boa gave them. 

'I'm not upset. I think we can have a good chuckle over it, honestly,' Vertical PR partner Holly Wells told NBC. 'My partner, Stephanie, who's terrified of snakes, might think a little bit differently. But I think it's all fun and games.'

Holly's partner Stephanie Lacsa was the first person to encounter the snake at their office in the Old City Hall building last Tuesday.

Interesting day at work: Vertical PR partner Stephanie Lacsa (left) was the first to see the snake last week, as she was trying to plunge their mysteriously clogged toilet. She saw the snake's tongue and ran out of the bathroom, taping the door shut before telling partner Holly Well (right) about the invader  

Facebook: Wells took to Facebook to describe the experience saying 'Happy New Years to us' 

The office toilet had been clogging up, and when Lacsa went to use a plunger, she saw the snake peak it's head out of the siphon.

'I thought my eyes were deceiving me,' Lasca said of the moment she saw the snake's tongue flicker in the toilet. 

 Lacsa screamed and ran from the bathroom, taping the door shut before she called animal services, FOX news reports. 

An animal services employee arrived to find the Columbian rainbow boa curled up behind the toilet.

The animal services employee was even shocked, telling NBC the situation was 'the stuff of urban legends.' 

Animal Services Deputy Director Dan DeSousa told NBC that when in the care of animal services, the snake got 'nippy' and bit its handler.  

The snake's owner came forward to claim the pet the next day. 

Since the snake is molting, it's believed it slithered into the sink to soak his skin for the shedding process.
