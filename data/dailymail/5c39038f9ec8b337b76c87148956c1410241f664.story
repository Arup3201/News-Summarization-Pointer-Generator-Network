Training: Prince Harry standing in front of his Apache Helicopter in the remote California desert in October last year

Prince Harry may return to the front line in Afghanistan before the end of the year.

General Sir David Richards, Chief of the Defence Staff, said yesterday said the Prince is ‘likely’ to resume operational duties, raising the prospect he will soon be flying Apache helicopters in Helmand.

Addressing the Queen at the Diamond Jubilee Parade and Muster military tribute in Windsor, Gen Richards said: ‘Prince Harry’s success in flying training means it is likely he will serve operationally again.’

It is the first time such a senior military figure has given such a clear indication of Harry’s future deployment.

Harry’s return to the war zone will again raise fears he would be a ‘trophy’ target for the Taliban.

Harry has been on ‘limited combat ready’ status since February, which means he could be sent to Afghanistan with 662 Squadron.

He was last in Afghanistan in 2008, but flew home when news of his deployment broke in the media.

Prince Harry qualified as an Apache helicopter pilot in February this year after 18 months of training in the UK and US.

Prince Harry was a high-flyer during his Apache training, qualifying top of his class - which is a huge achievement given how notoriously difficult these airborne tanks are to master.

Captain Wales, as he is known in the Army air corps, was presented with the best co-pilot gunner award during a dinner to mark the end of his course.
