Derby County have expressed an interest in Aston Villa misfit Darren Bent, with Steve McClaren hoping to take him on loan until the end of the season and end his Villans career for good.

The 30-year-old striker has been on loan at Championship strugglers Brighton & Hove Albion where he scored two goals in five games.

He missed their victory over Fulham on Monday night after being ruled out with a groin strain and the expiry of his loan means he is now back with Villa.

Darren Bent is a loan target for Derby County after returning to Aston Villa from Brighton & Hove Albion

The striker scored twice in five appearances for Brighton before leaving the field with an injury

Bent moved to Villa Park in January 2011 for a club-record fee of £18million but has fallen out of favour

Bent is paid £65,000 a week by Villa but Derby would only contribute a fraction of that. Brighton paid around £20,000 of his wages but the Rams would look to reduce that even further.

The striker cost Villa £18million when he signed in January 2011 for a club-record fee. 

Derby want a goalscorer to bolster their promotion push and Bent appears to fit the bill. They have failed in offers for Ross McCormack at Fulham and have asked about PEC Zwolle striker Tomas Necid, who is on loan from CSKA Moscow.

They may face late competition from Crystal Palace but Bent is keen on joining up with former England manager  McClaren in a bid to revive his career.

Derby have already failed in an offer to bring Fulham striker Ross McCormack to the club

They are also interested in Czech Republic striker Tomas Necid
