Former Bishop of Rochester Michael Nazir-Ali urged Christian Girl Guides to continue to fight plans to scrap the promise to 'love my God'

A Former Bishop yesterday urged Christian Girl Guides leaders to  continue to fight plans  to scrap the promise to ‘love my God’.

Michael Nazir-Ali, formerly Bishop of Rochester, said they should follow the example of ‘rogue’ leaders who are defying their national HQ’s controversial orders.

From next month youngsters will instead promise to ‘be true to myself and develop my beliefs’ after it was decreed the old promise could discourage new members from joining.

However, a group of Guide  leaders in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, are resisting adopting the new promise, saying the organisation has ‘God at its core’.

Bishop Nazir-Ali said: ‘If there are others like this group – indeed I would hope that there are many others like it – why should they not be allowed to continue to have a reference to God? If these people really believe in diversity they would allow them to do that. Why should they face  expulsion from the Girl Guides movement which is rooted in the Christian faith?’

Warning the row could lead to a split in the Guides as a whole, he added: ‘Ultimately if there is not going to be any diversity permitted, these people may need to group together in a way that they can support one another.’

Hazel Mitford, who runs St Paul’s Girl Guides in Harrogate, Brownie leader Jayne Morrison and Alison Ellison, who runs the Rainbows for younger girls,  criticised the change in a letter to a local newspaper.

A decision was made in June to replace the allegiance to God with the words 'be true to myself and develop my beliefs' (file picture)

They said: ‘Girlguiding has God at its core and anyone who has issue with this is free to start their own organisation.’

Their
 stance prompted an atheist leader who recently joined their group to 
enlist the National Secular Society to help her ensure the new, secular 
pledge is adopted, arguing she is acting in the interests of ‘feminism’.

Jem
 Henderson, 28, who was a Guide as a teenager and calls herself a 
‘post-punk, feminist poet’, joined the Harrogate group in June after 
hearing about the secular promise.

But
 she claims other leaders’ ‘insistence on keeping the old promise’ 
excludes her and atheist girls from joining the troop ‘or asks us to lie
 when making the promise’.

She
 added: ‘It is just unfortunate that there are little bastions of people
 who are actually wrong about the Guiding movement – they think it is 
based on God but actually it is based on girls.

A mention of vowing to love or serve God has been included in the Promise since the Guides began in 1910. This picture shows a hail for the Queen from some of the 4,000 Girl Guides at the World Guide Camp in Windsor Great Park in August 1957

‘My motivation is feminism and community based. This is a clash between the old promise and the new.’

The
 National Secular Society, has written to Girlguiding UK seeking 
clarification that all groups will be required to use the new promise.

Yesterday
 Mrs Mitford, who has been a guide leader for more than 20 years, met 
with other senior leaders in a bid to ease tensions.

She said: ‘I’m part of this  fantastic organisation which changes girls’ lives.

‘But
 this is turning into something very destructive and I’ve no desire to 
get into a shouting match with the National Secular Society.’

Chief Guide Gill Slocombe said: ‘When members make their Promise after September 1 the new Promise must be used.

‘Whilst
 all leaders will need to accept this change as we go forward, we will 
be talking with leaders who are anxious to help them resolve any 
difficulties.

‘We sincerely hope it won’t be necessary for anyone to leave the organisation.’
