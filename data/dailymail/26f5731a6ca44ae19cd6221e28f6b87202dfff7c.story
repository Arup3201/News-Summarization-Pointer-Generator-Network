Sam Smith heads the nominations for 2015 BRIT Awards after being shortlisted for five awards, narrowly ahead of Ed Sheeran and George Ezra who are up for four apiece.

Soul singer Smith, 22, is in the running for prizes such as best male, best album and best newcomer at the prize bash to be staged next month - a year after he collected the Critics' Choice title.

Rock duo Royal Blood will compete for a trio of awards, while singer Jess Glynne also finds her name on the shortlists three times as a guest vocalist on singles by Route 94 and Clean Bandit.

Brits chairman Max Lousada said: 'This year's nominations reflect a vintage year for British talent. The mix of new and established acts, the variety of genres represented and the level of global success many of these acts are enjoying shows UK music at its very best and sets the stage for a fantastic show in February.'

Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the Brit Awards and music industry body BPI, said: 'These nominations capture the buzz around new British music right now, and acknowledge the arrival of a new generation of talent that will ensure the continuing success of British music around the world.'

Also on hand to see the nominations announced were MTV's Laura Whitmore and nominees Jessie Ware and Jess Glynne.

Back in December, newcomer James May was announced as the 2015 BRITs Critics' Choice Award winner, following in Sam Smith's footprints from last year. 

The 24 year-old singer-songwriter and guitarist, who has supported the likes of Tom Odell and John Newman on tour, is set to release his debut album in the spring . 

'I'm pretty speechless,' James enthused. 'After all the years I've spent watching the BRITs and even after this year; watching my fan base grow so much, I never ‎thought I'd actually be getting an award myself.

'And what a huge honour to be following the incredible artists who've won before! I'm really chuffed, thank you to everyone who has supported me.

Future star: James Bay was crowned the winner of the 2015 BRITs Critics' Choice Award back in December and got his hand on his prize at The BRITs Are Coming nominations show

James can now count himself on a par with Adele, Florence and the Machine, Ellie Goulding, Jessie J, Emeli Sandé, Tom Odell and Sam Smith.

The BRITs Critics' Choice Award winners are chosen by a panel of music industry experts and key media tastemakers from among a list of over 100 candidates.

Meanwhile, the BRIT Awards are taking place on Wednesday 25 February at The O2 and award-winning artist Tracy Emin has designed this year's statue.

Explaining how she put her own twist on the iconic trophy, Tracy said: 'You want to do it really well. You don't just want to decorate it, you want to make something that is really Tracey-ish, that is special for the people receiving it.'

The star has become the fifth British artist to create her own design since the concept was established in 2011.
