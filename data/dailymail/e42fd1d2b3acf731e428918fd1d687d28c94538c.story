John Carver admits he feared for his own future and Newcastle’s season after he rowed with supporters ahead of their 4-0 humiliation at Southampton, labelling the day ‘one of the darkest of my life’.

This evening, caretaker boss Carver and his players will be bidding for revenge against a Saints side who played their part in one of the worst days in United’ s recent history.

Carver, then assistant to Alan Pardew, got involved in an expletive-laden altercation with fans before the game when he objected to a ‘Pardew Out’ banner in the away end.

What followed on the pitch was a comprehensive drubbing to leave the Magpies bottom of the Premier League as the Toon Army turned on the team and their manager.

And Carver – who was a teenage player at St James’ Park before returning as a coach in 1992 - says that September afternoon ranks as the lowest of his time at the club.

‘It was absolutely the worst day of my time here – it was one of the darkest days of my life to be honest,’ he said.

‘I was embarrassed to be part of Newcastle United coaching staff. I feared the worst for the season that night. It stayed with me for a long time.

‘Yes, we played against a good team but we created nothing on the day and they could have won it by six or seven, and that's not right. I'll be telling the guys at the team meeting that we've got a point to prove.’

Carver later issued an apology for the clash with fans, as did goalkeeping coach Andy Woodman, who got involved in a Twitter row with another supporter.

And Carver reflected: ‘It started badly even before kick-off. I have to go on record to say I didn't have a problem with the fans protesting, but when Tim Krul said to me he was a bit disappointed with the banners being raised before kick-off, that was the only thing that upset me.

‘People who know me know that I'm never going to walk away from a situation like that. I was trying to do the best for the team and all I was saying was telling them not to put the banners up there and then. Then he came back at me a couple of times and unfortunately I reacted the wrong way.

‘You know what I'm like, I'm not a shrinking violet, am I? I apologised afterwards, absolutely, and rightly so, but there wasn't one that came the other way.’

Carver, though, says he was concerned about the reaction towards him in the following game at home to Hull.

‘I do care and I'd realised I made a mistake,’ said Carver, who celebrated his 50th birthday yesterday.

‘I realised how bad we'd been during the game. The fans were right to be unhappy with the way we'd played. I made that situation even worse and going into the Hull game straight after, I did feel uncomfortable for the first time ever when we were doing the warm-up.

‘I wasn't quite sure of the reaction I'd get from people but I have to say it was very good. That surprised me a bit to be honest.

‘Then we went on a winning run and the reaction from the fans was brilliant, that helped and made us stronger.’

Carver could remain at the helm at Newcastle until the summer, when Garde could take the job

Carver, meanwhile, will sit down with managing director Lee Charnley after today's game to discuss the club's search for a new head coach. 

The squad fly to Dubai tomorrow for a four-day break and do not play again until the trip to Hull on January 31. 

It is expected that an announcement will be made before the end of the month, with former Lyon boss Remi Garde the favourite to be installed. 

He, though, would prefer to wait until the summer and there is a strong possibility that Carver will be put in charge until May.
