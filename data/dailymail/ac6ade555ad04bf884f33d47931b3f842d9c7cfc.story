America's mega-rich just keep getting richer - but Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates 
remains on top, taking number one spot on Forbes' wealth list for the 
20th straight year with $72 billion.

Forbes released its annual list of the richest Americans on Monday. The 400 people on the rankings posted a joint net worth of $2 
trillion, up from $1.7 trillion a year ago.

That marks their highest 
combined value ever and this astounding figure further outlines the growing gap between the exceptionally wealthy and the rest of the country.

While most of the names and rankings didn't change from a year ago, the majority of members of the elite club saw their fortunes grow over the past year, helped by strong stock and real estate markets.

All smiles: Bill Gates is the richest man in the U.S. for the 20th year running, with a net worth of $72 billion

Spare change: Wal-Mart heir Christie Walton (left) was the highest woman on the rich list at number six, with a net worth of $35.4 billion

'Basically, the mega rich are mega richer,' said Forbes Senior Editor Kerry Dolan.

Dolan noted that list's minimum net income increased to a pre-financial crisis level of $1.3 billion, up from $1.1 billion in 2012, with 61 American billionaires not making the cut. 

'In some ways, it's harder to get on the list than it ever has been,' she said.

Gates remains America's richest man, taking the top spot on the list for the 20th straight year, with a net worth of $72 billion, up from $66 billion a year ago.

Investor Warren Buffett, the head of Berkshire Hathaway, posted another distant second place finish with $58.5 billion, but increased his net worth from $46 billion.

Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison stayed
third with $41 billion and was the only member of the top 10 whose net 
worth was unchanged from a year ago.

Runners-up: Warren Buffett (left) and Larry Ellison (right) were second and third. Buffett is worth $58.5 billion while Ellison has $41 billion in the bank

Brothers
Charles and David Koch, co-owners of Koch Industries, stay tied 
for fourth with $36 billion each, up from $31 billion in 2012.

Wal-Mart heirs Christy Walton, Jim 
Walton, Alice Walton and S. Robson Walton took the next four spots, with
holdings ranging from $33.3 billion to $35.4 billion, all increasing 
from year-ago levels.

New 
York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the founder of the eponymous 
financial information company, rounds out the top 10 with $31 billion, 
up from $25 billion.

A
total of 48 women made the list including Hyatt Hotels heir Jennifer 
Pritzker at No. 327. Formerly known as James Pritzker, she's the list's 
first transgendered member.

According to Forbes, 273 members of the list are self-made billionaires, while 71 inherited their wealth and another 56 inherited at least some of it but are still growing it.

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg returned
to the list's top 20 after dropping out the year before. His net worth 
of $19 billion earned him the No. 20 spot.

Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz also made the list, at No. 85,with a net worth of $5.2 billion.

At age 29 and just a few days younger the Zuckerberg, Moskovitz ranks as the youngest member of the list.

On
the flip side, the oldest person on the list is 98-year-old David 
Rockefeller Sr. at No. 193 with a net worth of $2.8 billion.

A
total of 20 new people joined the rankings. The highest new entry was 
Don Hankey of Auto Loans, worth $1.6 million at 342 on the list.

Other newcomers included Richard Yuengling Jr. of Pennsylvania beer maker D.G. Yuengling & Son, who ranked at No. 371 with $1.4 billion.

Twenty-eight people dropped off the list, including six who died.

Those
now falling short of the cut include energy tycoon T. Boone Pickens at 
$950 million, Graham Weston of Rackspace Hosting at $920 million and 
Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder at $1.2 billion.

Meanwhile,
the average net worth of the list's members rose to $5 billion, also 
the highest ever, up from $4.2 billion in 2012. Net worth grew for 314 
members and fell for 30, Forbes said.

The
increases aren't surprising, given that net worth for America's 
wealthiest people has risen in the years since the financial crisis, 
widening the gap between the exceptionally well-to-do and the rest of 
the country.

According
to a study of Internal Revenue Service figures released last week, the 
top 1 percent of U.S. earners collected 19.3 percent of household income
in 2012, their largest share in IRS figures going back a century.

U.S. income inequality has been growing for almost three decades.

But
until last year, the top 1 percent's share of pre-tax income had not 
yet surpassed the 18.7 percent it reached in 1927, according to the 
analysis done by economists at the University of California, Berkeley, 
the Paris School of Economics and Oxford University.

Some
economists have speculated that the incomes of the wealthy might have 
surged in the past year, because they cashed in stock holdings to avoid 
higher capital gains taxes that kicked in in January.
