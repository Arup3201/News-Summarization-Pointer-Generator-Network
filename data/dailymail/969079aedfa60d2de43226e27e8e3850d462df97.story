A frozen fountain dyed red to support hopes for a Chiefs playoff win ended up just looking like an arctic murder scene on Friday.

Kansas City officials eager for their home team's first trip to the Super Bowl since 1970 experimented this year at the Northland fountain, known for its beautiful winter ice mounds.

Unfortunately for Chiefs fans, the startling result also preceded a spectacular loss to the Indianapolis Colts on Saturday and kicked off a round of stinging ridicule by national media and hometown fans alike.

Startling: City officials dyed the Northland fountain in an attempt to show team spirit for their hometown Chiefs but ended up with something grisly

'This is the first time we have attempted to dye a frozen fountain. #ChiefsKingdom,” wrote the Kansas City, Missouri Parks and Recreation Department on its Facebook page.

And as Facebook user Mark Frazier responded, '"Attempt" is the key word.'

Photos on the city Facebook page show the steady progression of the fountain from crimson-spattered winter wonderland to sickly pink wasteland.

More than one commenter drew a cinematic parallel.

'Looks like the scene in Fargo were Steve Buscemi is going through the wood chipper...' wrote Mary Mahoney.

National news outlets have picked up on the Kansas City fountain put-downs, as well.

'Looks like something horrible happened': Pinkish ice and slush shot out of the fountain, which freezes every year into what are usually more pleasant frozen piles

'Looks like the scene in Fargo were Steve Bushemi is going through the wood chipper,' said one Facebook commenter

'Sadly, Frosty The Snowman met an untimely demise...' wrote Facebook user Katie Chappelle

USA Today wrote: 'It just looks like there should be police tape around the whole thing' and said the fountain looked like 'something from a horror movie.'

'It looks like something horrible happened here,' wrote Deadspin.

While the widespread ridicule of its attempt at showing team pride undoubtedly hurts for the folks of Kansas City, what happened afterwards probably hurts worse.

More tranquil times: The fountain is the city's only one that stays on year-round and becomes a spectacle every year when it freezes

'This is the first time we have attempted to dye a frozen fountain. #ChiefsKingdom,¿ wrote the Kansas City, Missouri Parks and Recreation Department on its Facebook page.

Temperatures in Kansas City were expected to dip to zero by Monday evening, making it likely that any pink ice that remains in the fountain won't be melting away any time soon

Hopes were high on Saturday that the Chiefs would break their record streak of seven losing post-season games.

Kansas City had raced to a 31-10 halftime lead against the Colts and then took advantage of an interception early in the third quarter to tack on a touchdown that several Chiefs would say later should have sealed the game.

But a dismal second half performance ended the game with a painful 45-44 loss for the Chiefs in Indianapolis.

'"Attempt" is the key word,' mocked Facebook user Mark Frazier
