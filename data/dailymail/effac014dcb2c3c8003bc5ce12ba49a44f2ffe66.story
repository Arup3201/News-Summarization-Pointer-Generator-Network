Bottles, fireworks and smoke bombs were set off as 1,500 officers tried to contain thousands of English Defence League supporters holding a protest march in Luton today.

The town centre was flooded with police as tensions mounted that the right wing organisation's members might clash with a counter demonstration by a 1,000-strong group from Unite Against Fascism at the same time in the usually busy shopping area.

Two people were arrested on suspicion of public order offences, police said.

Bedfordshire Police said the day of 
action had concluded peacefully, despite ‘isolated incidents’ of 
disorder including smoke flares being set off and bottles being thrown 
towards police officers.

The cost of the police operation is put at between £600,000 and £1million and for the council £600,000.

Bedfordshire Police and Luton council 
tried to send out the message that Luton was open as normal and 
encouraged shops in the Mall to remain open.

But many shoppers chose to ignore the advice, instead deciding to stay away amid fears violence might erupt.

A police spokeswoman said a group of 
people from the counter protest, which formed under the 'We Are Luton' banner, had attempted to break away from the 
main march but were pushed back by officers.

Assistant Chief Constable Andrew 
Richer said: ‘Overall the policing of these protests has been a 
resounding success and is testament to everyone involved including the 
community themselves and our partners.

‘It is disappointing that we saw 
disorder from some members of Unite Against Fascism, who were part of 
the 'We Are Luton' march, who attempted to break out of the agreed 
protest route. This shows policing of these events is justified as there
is such a large area to protect.

‘The policing operation has been in 
the planning for weeks and the professionalism of the officers was borne
out today. We were assisted by 20 forces and it's a great example of 
how forces can work together in difficult circumstances.

‘I'd like to thank everyone involved 
in the planning and execution of the operation, all our partner agencies
and in particular the community mediators who volunteered to help us 
communicate.

'Their involvement really made a difference. I am confident 
the town is now back to normal and disruption has been minimised.’

Police said the two people arrested 
remained in police custody. A spokeswoman said one was an EDL supporter 
and the other from the 'We Are Luton' group.

Councillor Hazel Simmons, leader of 
Luton Borough Council, said: ‘I'd like to thank Bedfordshire Police, all
the staff at the council and everyone in the community for coming 
together and again facilitating a peaceful day in Luton.

‘I was very disappointed that the EDL 
chose to come to Luton again today so soon after their previous protest 
in February last year which caused large scale disruption to the people 
of the town and loss of trade for its businesses.

‘I would like to stress that what 
happened in town today does not represent the real Luton. The Luton I 
know is a town where people get along well together, celebrate our 
diversity and work together to overcome challenges.’

Show of force: The massive police operation cost around £1million as tensions mounted that EDL members might clash with anti-fascist demonstrators in central Luton

Police were on duty to make sure EDL demonstrators did not enter the Bury Park area of Luton, where most of the town's 30,000 Muslim population live.

They also were there to prevent any Muslims attacking the EDL.

The EDL has held demonstrations across the country since it was formed in Luton in March 2009 as a response to Muslim radicals, who disrupted a home-coming parade by the Royal Anglian Regiment.

In February, last year, their demonstration in St George's Square in Luton cost businesses £1 million as the shopping centre was closed.
