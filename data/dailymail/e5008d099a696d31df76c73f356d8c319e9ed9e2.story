It was a case of sartorial deja vu for Spain's Queen Letizia today as she stepped out in a knee-length Felipe Varela purple dress for the second day in a row.

The ensemble was almost identical to the Felipe Varela ensemble worn to the opening of the 2014/15 year at the Castilla-La Mancha University yesterday, although the nude peep-toes were gone - replaced by classic black courts.

Not to be outdone, Felipe, 46, also chose to add a splash of violet to his look, accessorising his dapper navy suit with a bright purple tie.

The royal couple were closer to home for today's engagement, which saw them welcome the president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández and his wife Ana Garcia to the Zarzuela Palace.

After, as is traditional, greeting them in front of the waiting press, Felipe and Letizia then whisked the Honduran couple inside for a state reception.

During the reception, Letizia, 42, looked on intently as President Hernández made a speech to assembled dignitaries, following a welcome from King Felipe.

The Spanish royals have had a busy schedule to contend with of late, with a visit to New York last week followed by a series of engagements at home in Spain.

Yesterday saw the couple greeted by excited cheers as they arrived at the Castilla-La Mancha University in Toledo ahead of a reception with academics.

It isn't the first time the couple have spent time with academics in recent days, with a visit to meet Spanish intellectuals working in New York included in their American trip.

The visit, which saw Letizia reunited with her old friend Queen Maxima of the Netherlands, saw King Felipe make a speech at the UN in which he called for Spain to be given a temporary seat on the UN Security Council.
