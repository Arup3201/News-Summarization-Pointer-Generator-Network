'I am so concerned about my  13-year-old grandson. He is ruining life for his parents and two younger siblings' (picture posed by model)

I am so concerned about my 13-year-old grandson. He is ruining life for his parents and two younger
 siblings. I lose sleep at night worrying.

He has a violent temper which erupts when he is told off, and although he is, or was, a very clever grammar school boy, he won’t do homework or take pride in his appearance.

He steals food – a six-pack of desserts from the fridge, or a whole packet of biscuits. Last week his dad had money taken from his wallet. We know it was him, to buy sweets.

Our GP suggested he has an eating disorder and we’re now waiting for a specialist referral.

But I wonder if he could have Asperger’s syndrome, or depression. Can you advise us please and suggest coping strategies?

This is a terribly sad, complex problem 
made all the more difficult because of the ripple effect this boy’s 
behaviour is having on the whole family.

At the centre is a teenager who used to 
be happy and now is desperately in need of love and support from the 
family he appears to be rejecting.

Rather than looking for coping 
strategies, it’s his change in personality that needs exploring. Normal 
teenage angst could be the reason: not every child sails through 
adolescence.

But it is equally possible that he is depressed, terribly anxious or suffering self-esteem issues. Focusing on the food aspect is wrong: it’s just one of many self-destructive symptoms.

An eating disorder assessment can take time, and is not a holistic approach to his troubles. It is unlikely he has developed Asperger’s at this age given his lack of previous symptoms but I am concerned that what you describe is more than simply a difficult teenager.

His parents need to go back to the GP and ask for a mental health assessment with the child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) team: they not only offer assessment and therapy, they will also look at support for the family.

Although he appears to want to destroy everything around him he is simply trying to exert control over his life; perhaps he feels out of control with his feelings or rules from home. Could his choices for food be more flexible and free?

With a situation like this it is very easy for parents to slip into a very negative rhetoric, whereas what he needs is a more positive approach. Given his behaviour, praising him must be hard. But love, support and encouragement as well as safe, clear boundaries are what he needs.

My husband went to see his GP with a suspicious mole on his back – partly black, partly pink and bleeding intermittently – in September 2012 and was told it was ‘nothing to worry about’.

Malignant melanoma is not always easy to diagnose

Still worried, six months later he saw a different GP. A biopsy diagnosed melanoma. By October last year there were tumours in his abdomen, bowel and spine.

He passed away in February, and suffered greatly. We are devastated, as he was always careful in the sun – and want people to know more about this deadly cancer. 

I am so sorry for your loss. It is not always easy to diagnose melanoma – there are roughly 9,000 a cases a year so the majority of moles a GP will assess will be benign.

However, sadly, your instinct was right. A mole that is bleeding and has different colours warrants further assessment.

Other red flags are an irregular border, rapid growth and asymmetry: this should have instigated a referral to a dermatologist within the NHS guidelines of two weeks.

We must never assume that someone who covers up in the sun will not get skin cancer: melanoma is associated with sun exposure particularly as a child but there are other risk factors too including being fair-skinned, having a lot of moles and family history.

In any medical situation, it is never wrong to listen to your instinct and push for a timely second opinion.

Drug companies are yet to bring out a female version of Viagra – despite spending billions on research.

There are treatments, mainly available privately, such as testosterone or other hormonal therapies.

But critics point out that for women, unlike men, the problem isn’t a mechanical one that can be fixed with a pill.

Jamie Dornan will soon play Christian Grey in 50 Shades of Grey. 'If only they could distill him into tablet form,' said Dr Ellie

We are more cerebral creatures. With this in mind, I have greatly enjoyed New Worlds on Channel 4, starring the delectable Jamie Dornan, pictured above with Freya Mavor.

He is to appear as Christian Grey in the film of Fifty Shades Of Grey, a book that has undoubtedly done more to enhance women’s sex lives than all the potions the pharmaceutical giants can muster.

If only they could distil him into tablet form.

Not a week goes by without some new diet advice that promises to release the nation from the grip of obesity.

Dr Ellie said it seemed 'rather ridiculous' to opt for a supposedly 'healthier' whisky if you consume vastly more alcohol

This week, we’ve been told which alcoholic drinks to opt for on the basis of lower sugar content.

Whatever the opinion of my esteemed colleagues at Action on Sugar, it seems rather ridiculous to opt for a supposedly ‘healthier’ whisky if you consume vastly more alcohol.

While cutting sugar is the new fad, let’s stick to proven sensible health advice for a nation of big drinkers: keep alcohol intake down, never mind the sugar.

And a word of caution about the other big diet story this week – research seemingly showing we should aiming for seven or even 10 portions of fruit and veg a day.

Researchers claimed that those eating more portions of fruit and veg were less likely to die.

But the study didn’t ask about other dietary intake nor exercise levels.

So while they showed people who eat more veg live longer, they can’t say if it is because of this, or because they also tend to be the people who exercise and avoid junk food.

A few more frozen peas isn’t a cure for an unhealthy lifestyle.
