You may think that your Teflon-coated frying pan is pretty good at repelling water.

But scientists have now made metals so hydrophobic - literally meaning water fearing - that droplets bounce off them.

Unlike Teflon, which is a coating applied to metal, researchers used lasers to etch microscopic patterns into metal, giving it the ‘super’ property.

Scientists have used lasers to etch a nanostructure into metals, making them so hydrophobic, or water repellent, that water droplets bounce off the surface, when sprinkled from a height (pictured)

Scientists at the University of Rochester in New York, believe their invention could be used to prevent rust, stop airplanes icing up, improve sanitation in developing countries and to make efficient and low maintenance solar panels. 

Chunlei Guo and Anatoliy Vorobyev, of the university’s Institute of Optics, used a precise laser-patterning technique to create an intricate pattern of nanoscale structures in metal. 

To make water roll off a Teflon-coated material (as used in the frying pan shown), it needs to be titled to a 70 degree angle, whereas Professor Guo’s material only needs to be titled less than five degrees before liquid slides off and is said to be super hydrophobic

To create the water repellent material, scientists used extremely powerful, ultra-short laser pulses to etch a nanostructure - microscopic patterns - into metal and change its surface.

A femtosecond laser pulse lasts just of a quadrillionth of a second but at its peak, reaches a power equivalent to the entire power grid of North America.

The etchings are part of the surface so they won't rub off, unlike a Teflon coating, for example.

The new material is so water repellent that water droplets bounce off it.

The researchers claim it's more slippery than Teflon. To make water roll off a Teflon-coated material, it needs to be titled to a 70 degree angle, whereas Professor Guo’s material only needs to be titled less than five degrees before liquid slides off.

They are exploring its self-cleaning properties too. The material allows water droplets to collect dust, cleaning the surface and leaving it dry.

It could be used to prevent rust, stop airplanes icing up and to make efficient and low maintenance solar panels.

They used extremely powerful, but ultra-short, laser pulses - which despite lasting a quadrillionth of a second, reach a power equivalent to the entire power grid of North America -  to change the surface of the metals. 

Their work builds on earlier research by the team in which they used a similar laser-patterning technique to turn metals black. 

Professor Guo explained that the technique creates surfaces that not only repel water, but are also absorb light effectively.

‘The structures created by our laser on the metals are intrinsically part of the material surface,’ he said, so that they won’t rub off like a coating. It is the patterns that make the metals repel water.

‘The material is so strongly water repellent, the water actually gets bounced off,’ the professor of optics said.

‘Then it lands on the surface again, gets bounced off again, and then it will just roll off from the surface.

The etched metals are more slippery than Teflon, which is a common hydrophobic material that’s often used to coat non-stick pans.

Unlike Teflon, it’s described as being super-hydrophobic and as water rolls off the laser-etched surface of metals, it also collects dust particles, cleaning the surface. 

To test this self-cleaning property, his team took ordinary dust from a vacuum cleaner and dumped it onto a treated surface.  

Professor Guo hopes that the hydrophobic material could make water collection more efficient in developing countries. Here, a girl in Ghana makes a labour-intensive trip to fetch water

Roughly half of the dust particles were removed with just three drops of water and it only took a dozen drops to leave the surface spotless. 

The surface was also left completely dry, meaning that if it was used to coat pans in the future, washing up could be much easier. 

Professor Guo is excited about the potential applications of super-hydrophobic materials in developing countries and the research his supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

‘In these regions, collecting rain water is vital and using super-hydrophobic materials could increase the efficiency without the need to use large funnels with high-pitched angles to prevent water from sticking to the surface,’ he said.

’A second application could be creating latrines that are cleaner and healthier to use.’

However, before pans and water-collecting equipment can become a reality, a faster method for etching metals has to be created.

It currently takes an hour to pattern a metal sample measuring one square inch.

The researchers are also looking into ways of applying the technique to other, non-metal materials. 

Professor Guo believes that the technique could be used to create multifunctional metals.

Turning metals black makes them efficient at absorbing light, which when combined with water repellent properties, could lead to more efficient and rust-proof solar panels that don’t need cleaning.

The team has also used lasers to attract water to materials. This proved so effective, that they managed to make a drop of water run ‘uphill’ when put into contact with the hydrophilic material.

The study was published in the Journal of Applied Physics.
