Manchester United are due to hold talks with Danny Welbeck over his future in the coming days.

The England forward is unsure how much of a role he will play this season with Louis van Gaal and will weigh up his options over the next fortnight.

Hull have tried and failed to sign him while Sunderland are keen as their search for strikers continues. Tottenham and Everton would be expected to show an interest also although the latter may struggle to afford a deal.

Doubts: Danny Welbeck wants talks with Manchester United over his future at the club

Unsure: Welbeck does not know where he will fit into manager Louis van Gaal's plans

Welbeck has been happy at United but wants to play and knows with European football his opportunities will be more limited this season. Van Gaal is also eager to see how James Wilson copes this season after impressing for the club's U21s.

United are giving a trial to 15-year-old Belgium youth star Indy Boonen, who left Genk this summer, but may only sign one, possibly two, players between now and the close of the window.

United's hierarchy maintain they are not chasing Real Madrid's Angel Di Maria nor Roma defender Mehdi Benatia who is a target for Bayern Munich.

Borussia Dortmund's Marco Reus is likely to become more of an option next season when his £20million clause kicks in. Roma's Kevin Strootman is also still in their their immediate plans.

It is understood, former Liverpool midfielder Xabi Alonso has also been offered to United and others as Real Madrid continue to look to trim their squad.

Arteta injury woe may make Arsenal go to market 

Mikel Arteta's ankle injury will prompt Arsenal to consider their transfer options over the coming days.

Arsene Wenger has been focusing on getting his side through the Champions League qualifier with Besiktas but has had an eye on recruiting a defender with Atletico Madrid's Toby Alderweireld and Kostas Manolas from Olympiacos among the options.

However, the need for more defensive qualities in his midfield remains. Much faith has been placed in the versatility of Calum Chambers but Arsenal have taken a fresh look at his former Southampton clubmate Victor Wanyama.

The Kenya midfielder impressed scouts in last week's game against Liverpool where he helped suppress the influence of Steven Gerrard on the game.

While Morgan Schneiderlin earned plaudits for his return, Wanyama's performance was noted as he gave Southampton's defence extra protection and allowed the front five to advance in the second half.

Coach Ronald Koeman is a fan of Wanyama but the 23-year-old has become unsettled by the sales in the summer and is keen to see who else the coach brings in over the next fortnight.

Wanyama's role at Southampton has been understated but the statistics support his affect on the team with less goals conceded when he plays. The Premier League's top six are continuing to monitor his progress.

Arsenal have also asked about Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Adrien Rabiot. The talented 19-year-old is expected to spend another season on the periphery of PSG's first team and is keen to leave but it won't be easy as the French champions demand £24m for him despite his contract having just one year left. AC Milan have offered Rabiot a two year loan.

Wenger says Arsenal have not had offers for any of his players but noises out of Germany persist that Lukas Podolski is a target for Galatasaray among others and the striker could be sold for £10m.

Balotelli on brink of shock Liverpool move 

Liverpool have agreed a fee of £16million and hope to complete a permanent deal for Mario Balotelli.

The move has surprised many at Anfield as Brendan Rodgers was adamant there was too much baggage with the Italian for him to fit into Liverpool's harmonious group.

The turnaround comes as Rodgers recognised the need for extra quality in attacking positions remains and Liverpool's other options have diminished.

Liverpool were prepared to pay the £12m loan fee and £8m in wages for Radamel Falcao's season loan from Monaco but the player still wants Real Madrid and the manager's reservations over Samuel Eto'o are that he is too much of a spent force. Talks had been continuing with the Cameroon striker's people up to Wednesday.

Return: Mario Balotelli is set to join Liverpool for £16million from AC Milan

No go: Radamel Falcao wants to move to Real Madrid rather than Liverpool

Everton have also held talks with Eto'o's representatives but while Roberto Martinez recognises the qualities the 33-year-old still possesses he has similar reservations to Liverpool and wonders whether a tight budget will be put to better use on younger players.

Belgium starlet David Henen will complete his move from Anderlecht but could go out on loan.

Meanwhile, AC Milan will look to replace Balotelli with an ambitious attempt to sign Jackson Martinez from Porto. They will also make a renewed request to Arsenal for Joel Campbell on loan. Porto have asked about Hull City target Vincent Aboubakar from Lorient. Steve Bruce is hopeful though of reaching accord with Blackburn for Jordan Rhodes as reported in Sportsmail.

Leeds target an Italian job (or two) 

Leeds United's expected march on the Italian transfer market is continuing as they show an interest in Udinese full-back Marco Davide Faraoni.

Owner Massimo Cellini has closed a £1m deal for Ternan striker Mirco Antenucci and is holding talks over a loan for Cagliari's Brazilian playmaker Adryan, and the 22-year-old Faraouni is seen as less of a risk having played for Watford in the Championship last season.

One player Leeds did miss out on, forward Kieran Agard, has joined Bristol City who have agreed a fee with Rotherham. The 24-year-old failed to agree personal terms with Leeds but League One Bristol City and manager Steve Cotterill have struck a deal.

Spurs braced for a double departure 

Tottenham are braced for a renewed push from Napoli for midfielder Sandro while Roma have made further enquiries for defender Vlad Chiriches.

On the move? Totenham midfielder Sandro is wanted by Serie A side Napoli

Roma's Walter Sabatini and chief executive Mauro Baldissoni have been in London to assess what the market demand is for their players while also looking at options in attack and defence.

Fernando Torres at Chelsea and Manchester City's Matija Nastasic were discussed a couple of weeks ago and further talks were held this week. Roma have Mattia Destro and Mehdi Benatia to offer but Destro in particular has been told by new Italy coach Antonio Conte that he must play regularly if he wants to make the national squad and a move to Chelsea does not promise that. Tottenham is a possible option for Destro but that may depend on what cash they are offered for Roberto Soldado.

Chiriches is an alternative to Nastasic, who also has interest from Juventus and Arsenal, but the Romanian is also nursing a back injury at the moment which may slow down negotiations.

Napoli will look to take Sandro on loan after the injury to Manchester United's Marouane Fellaini.

Chopra to play under Little Master... and James 

Former Blackpool, Newcastle and Sunderland striker Michael Chopra has been signed up to play for Sachin Tendulkar’s Kerala Blasters in the inaugural Indian Super League.

Kerala, who are co-owned by Indian batsman Tendulkar, will be managed by former Liverpool and England goalkeeper David James who has also been selected as the franchise’s marquee player.

Chopra, 30, who has scored 114 goals during spells with Cardiff, Watford, Ipswich and Blackpool, was Kerala’s first pick in Thursday’s International Players Draft in Mumbai.

He said: 'I am very excited to have been picked by Kerala Blasters. I just can't wait to get the boots back on and get on the pitch. To play for a team that is owned by Sachin Tendulkar is an honour.'

Welcome: Michael Chopra has joined Indian Super League side Kerala Blasters

Other notable moves saw Team Chennai pick former Manchester United midfielder Bojan Djordic and ex-Bolton and Hull City defender Bernard Mendy.

Former Liverpool players Josemi and Luis Garcia were selected for Atletico Kolkata, the franchise has Atletico Madrid and Sourav Ganguly among its co-owners.

The ISL, which will also feature David Trezeguet, Robert Pires and Freddie Ljungberg, kicks off on October 12.

Leicester consider Almeida as their Fox in the box

Leicester CIty are the latest club to consider Portugal striker Hugo Almeida. He is a free agent and has held discussions with West Ham while Hull City and Sunderland have also been mentioned but Leicester have now joined the race as they look to add a couple more signings before the window closes.

Almeida, 30, has a decent track record and Nigel Pearson would like cover for striker Leonardo Ulloa. 

A two-year deal for midfielder Esteban Cambiasso is also expected to be agreed on Thursday.
