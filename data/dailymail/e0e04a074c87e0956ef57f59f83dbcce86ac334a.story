It may look like a cross, but lines scratched into a cave wall could be proof that Neanderthals were more intelligent and creative than previously thought.

The cross-hatched engravings inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar are the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art.

The find is significant because it indicates that modern humans and their extinct cousins shared the capacity for abstract expression, according to a team of scientists who studied the site.

But is it art? Lines scratched into a cave could be proof that Neanderthals were more intelligent and creative than previously thought and some experts claim they are the first known examples of Neanderthal rock art

Experts examined and described the grooves in a rock that had been covered with sediment in the study published in the PNAS journal.

Archaeologists had previously found artefacts associated with Neanderthal culture laid over the top of the artwork, suggesting that the engravings must be older, said Professor Clive Finlayson, director of heritage at the Gibraltar Museum.

'The production of purposely made painted or engraved designs on cave walls is recognised as a major cognitive step in human evolution - considered exclusive to modern humans, he said.

'Here we present the first known example of an abstract pattern engraved by Neanderthals from Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar.

'It consists of a deeply impressed cross-hatching carved into the bedrock of the cave older than 39,000 years.

'Most of the lines composing the design were made by repeatedly and carefully passing a pointed lithic tool into the grooves - excluding the possibility of an unintentional or utilitarian origin. 

The art, discovered inside Gorham's Cave in Gibraltar (marked) is believed to have been made by Neanderthals because experts have previously found Neanderthal artefacts there in the overlaying layers of the cave

Creative? The find is significant because it indicates that modern humans and Neanderthals (stock image) shared the capacity for abstract expression, according to a team of scientists who studied the site

The markings were already known to experts, but had been attributed to modern humans who arrived in Western Europe around 40,000 years ago.

The pattern was overlaid by undisturbed rocks in which Neanderthal artefacts had been discovered before, indicating the ‘art’ is older.

Archaeologists think the markings are 39,000 older than the other artefacts.

Chemical analysis of the mineral coating on the engraved grooves also indicates the art was produced before deposition of the overlying sediment.

The researchers shrunk photographs to microscopic scale to see the tool marks within the engraving and then compared them with experimental marks made with various tools.

They decided the abstract cave engraving was likely created intentionally by repeatedly passing a robust cutting tip over the rock in the same direction - and not by incidental cutting associated with other activities.

'This discovery demonstrates the Neanderthals' capacity for abstract thought and expression.' 

Professor Paul Tacon, an expert in rock art at Australia's Griffith University who was not involved with the study, said: ‘It is the last nail in the coffin for the hypothesis that Neanderthals were cognitively inferior to modern humans.

He believes that the marks were carved with great effort for ritual purposes and to communicate with others.  

‘We will never know the meaning the design held for the maker or the Neanderthals who inhabited the cave, but the fact that they were marking their territory in this way before modern humans arrived in the region has huge implications for debates about what it is to be human and the origin of art,’ he added. 

But not everyone is convinced that our hairy ancestors were the ancient answer to Jackson Pollock.

Another recently published study examining the dating of various archaeological sites across Europe raises the possibility that the markings may not have been made by Neanderthals but by modern humans.

Neanderthals disappeared between 41,030 and 39,260 years ago, while modern humans arrived in Europe about 45,000 to 43,000 years ago, according to that study - leaving several thousand years of overlap.  

Dr Clive Gamble, an archaeologist at the University of Southampton, said: ‘Any discovery that helps improve the public image of Neanderthals is welcome.’

‘We know they spoke, lived in large social groups, looked after the sick, buried their dead and were highly successful in the Ice Age environments of northern latitudes. As a result, rock engraving should be entirely within their grasp.’

‘What is critical, however, is the dating. While I want Neanderthals to be painting, carving and engraving, I'm reserving judgment.’

Contentious: Not everyone is convinced that Neanderthals were the ancient answer to Jackson Pollock (art pictured). Another recently published study examining the dating of various archaeological sites across Europe raises the possibility that the markings may not have been made by Neanderthals but by modern humans.

However, Professor Finlayson is certain that the artefacts, and therefore the engravings, were made by Neanderthals.

‘All European Neanderthal fossil sites from this period, including Devil's Tower Rock Shelter just one mile from Gorham's Cave, have this technology associated,’ he said.

‘In contrast no modern human site in Europe has this type of technology. So we are confident that the tools were made by Neanderthals.’

Previous research has suggested that Neanderthals could have survived in Gorham's Cave up to 24,000 years ago - making it one of the species' last refuge before modern humans completely took over.

Recently uncovered archaeological evidence indicates Neanderthals were more civilised than they have been given credit for. It appears that inhabitants of the cave liked to dine on roast pigeon, while fireplaces and 'rooms' in caves have been found elsewhere, suggesting Neanderthals lived in organised homes.

Toasted pigeon was a favourite dish of Neanderthals, who unlike their brutish reputation, had the brains and skill to catch the birds.

The discovery, announced in August, was made after an excavation of Gorham's Cave where Neanderthals are thought to have lived for nearly 100,000 years ago.

Archaeologists unearthed leftovers of Neanderthal feasts, which included pigeon bone, in sediments that built up between 28,000 and 67,000 years ago on the east face of Gibraltar.

Researchers believe the Neanderthals hunted wild pigeons, possibly by climbing steep cliffs to reach raid their nests.

So far, 150 ancient bird species have been identified from bones found in the cave sediments. Many were of rock doves, the ancestors of modern feral pigeons.

Twenty eight of the pigeon bones had cuts from stone tools and 15 had tooth marks.

Some also had signs of charring, which may have been created when the meat cooked on an open fire.

'They liked what we like and went for the breasts, the drumsticks and the wings,' study author Clive Finlayson, director of the Gibraltar Museum, told journalists of the bone analysis.

'They had the knowledge and technology to do this.'
