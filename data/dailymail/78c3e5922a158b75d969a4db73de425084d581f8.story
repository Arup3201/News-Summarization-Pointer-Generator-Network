Lionel Messi has become the latest footballing icon to star in Adidas' 'There will be haters' advertising campaign. 

The Barcelona star follows the likes of team-mate Luis Suarez, Chelsea striker Diego Costa and Real Madrid star Karim Benzema to be part of it. 

It comes off the back of Messi's stunning performance against Manchester City in their Champions League last-16 second leg, running the show at the Nou Camp and setting up Ivan Rakitic for the only goal of the game.

And it could be a special season for 27-year-old Messi, as Barcelona also remain in contention for the La Liga title and Copa del Rey. 

Next up Luis Enrique's side is the small matter of El Clasico, when Real Madrid visit on Sunday night and a victory for Barcelona could see them move four points clear of their rivals. 

They also face PSG in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, and Athletic Bilbao in the final of the Copa del Rey in May.
