Reading are showing interest in Nottingham Forest defender Jack Hobbs.

The 26-year-old only joined in January from Hull City.

Another Forest defender Danny Collins, 34, is wanted by Huddersfield Town.

Hobbs started in Forest's 2-1 victory over Bournemouth on Tuesday evening. 

Forest first-team coach Brian Eastick backed Britt Assombalonga to have a fine season after his individual performance.

A £5million summer signing from Peterborough, Assombalonga, headed home an Andy Reid cross after 66 minutes to cancel out Callum Wilson's toe-poked 58th minute opener after a defensive mix-up.

And in an unlikely turnaround, fellow new boy Matty Fryatt nicked the three points for the away side with 20 minutes left when he rose highest to send a Jack Hunt cross past Lee Camp.

Assambalonga, 21, has now bagged three league goals since linking up with Stuart Pearce and Eastick believes his forward line will continue to torment defences.

Eastick said: 'All the strikers will be very important in the hunt for promotion and will give each other good competition.

'It will be for other people to judge if Britt was worth every penny. We like to think he will be a good investment and think he will improve.'
