A wildflower has become the first living species in the UK to be named after Sir David Attenborough.

The Attenborough’s hawkweed (Hieracium attenboroughianum) was found a decade ago in South Wales but it took ten years of study to ensure it was a new separate species. 

It is one of a group of plants belonging to the daisy family and experts believe it has evolved in the Brecon Beacons since the last ice age.

It is found on rocky ledges on Cribyn - one of three peaks in the central Brecon Beacons which are owned and managed by the National Trust. 

It can be easily seen from the main path up to Cribyn in late June and early July when it colours the rocks yellow with its flowers.

Dr Tim Rich, the naturalist who named it, said Sir Attenborough had inspired him to study ecology as a teenager.

Dr Rich said: 'Finding a new species is a really exciting moment and something you dream of as a naturalist. 

'This is a personal thank you for the years of fascination he has given me going to different places to search for new things.'

Sir Attenborough said he was ‘thrilled’ and added: ‘Bestowing a name on a new species is surely one of the greatest biological compliments and I am truly grateful.

'It is an added joy that Hieracium attenboroughianum should be so beautiful and live in such a lovely part of the country.' 

Attenborough's hawkweed brings the number of plants and animals bearing the name of the world-famous broadcaster to 11, although the little plant is the first living species in the UK to be named after him.
