British fashion house Burberry is set to hold a series of live concerts in their London flagship - starting with a 1,000 capacity Kaiser Chiefs gig in April.

The Leeds-based band will kick off what is set to be a series of gigs for Burberry Acoustic, part of a project that brings together British fashion and music.

The Kaiser Chiefs are one of 
the nation's most successful bands, with massive hits like I Predict A 
Riot, Ruby and Every Day I Love You Less And Less in their back catalogue.

Their appearance marks the first public music event at the store - they have before now held private gigs with up and coming artists - and marks the beginning of a 
series of ticketed music events as Burberry continues to support and 
invest in established and emerging talent.

Burberry Acoustic was launched in 2010 to
celebrate the Burberry tradition of supporting British talent.

The 
artists are selected by the brand's Chief Creative Officer Christopher Bailey, who often uses live music, particularly from budding artists, as the soundtrack for his catwalk shows.

The
store, which opened its doors for the first time last September, has 
already hosted live performances by some of the best of British music, 
including Jake Bugg and Ren Harvieu, which saw nearly 800 people crowd into the space to 
watch.

British
talents in film, theatre and art have also been showcased, with talks 
by the BAFTA Academy Circle and British explorer and adventurer Olly 
Hicks.

800 fans and fashion lovers filled the flagship store to watch Jake Bugg perform, but more are expected for the Kaiser Chiefs

The auditorium-like space, which can hold up to 1,000 people, was designed to be as much a venue as a store - its previous incarnation was as a cinema.  

Burberry said of the collaboration: 'We have a long-standing association with British musicians (via tracks recorded for shows, connecting musicians with publishers and record labels via Burberry Acoustic and casting musicians in campaigns & advising them) – but this will be the first large scale public Burberry gig.'

Tickets will become available from Burberry.com today (Wednesday 10 April) at midday.
