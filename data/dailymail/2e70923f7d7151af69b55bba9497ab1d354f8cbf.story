Eight race horses were killed when a fire tore through the Kentucky barn they were housed in.

Trainer Gerry Carwood says the horses died in the early Friday morning inferno that started around 1.00 a.m. He saved two other thoroughbreds before firefighters arrived, but they were too late to rescue the others.

The suburban Lexington barn was rented to Carwood by the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission’s executive director, according to Reuters.

Inferno: The barn went up in flames shortly before 1.00 a.m. Friday morning

‘I ran down to the barn and I could hear everybody kicking and screaming, but it was too hot,’ Carwood told WKYT. ‘I couldn't go in. I tried to go in but I couldn't.’

The heartbroken Carwood trained all the horses that died in the blaze.

‘The outside barn was on fire and I managed to get those two horses out,’ he continued.

‘I pulled one out of the barn that was on fire. I brought him around to the other horse, opened up his stall and he ran out behind him.’

Workers at an airport control tower miles away called 911 after spotting the flames at about the time Carwood was scrambling to save his animals.

‘For them to see it, it was way too involved for us to be able to save it,’ a Lexington Fire Department spokesperson told Reuters.

‘From the time it was actually noticed until we got here...you do the math, five, six, seven, eight, 10 minutes. It's going to quickly consume a building that's an old tobacco barn, I'm being told,’ Battalion Chief Mark Harvey told WLEX.

Both Harvey and the property’s owner described Carwood as shaken by morning’s events.

A neighbour told WKYT that she saw a ‘big wall of fire… sparks flying really high and smoke billowing.’

She also called the blaze ‘very tragic’ and said she ‘wouldn’t wish that upon anyone.’

A single firefighter was injured battling the blaze when he hurt his shoulder.

The cause is still under investigation.
