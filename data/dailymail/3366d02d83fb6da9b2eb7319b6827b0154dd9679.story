Maria Shriver showed up at her cousin Bobby Kennedy Jr.'s wedding earlier this month with a buff date - and it wasn't husband Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Shriver, who has been separated from from Schwarzenegger since 2011, introduced her new beau Matthew Dowd to the family at the Kennedy Compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. 

Dowd is an all-star political consultant with a series of political accomplishments, a family and a history of personal heartbreak that nearly rivals the Kennedys. 

He's the third of 11 children from a strict Irish Catholic family. He was an altar boy and keeps at least 100 crosses in his rural Texas home. He's been married and divorced twice; his second marriage fell apart after one of his twin infant daughters died in the hospital, according to a 2007 profile piece in the Los Angeles Times.

And he helped get a president elected - twice, albeit one from the wrong party. Dowd served as a top political strategist for George W. Bush - worth on both his 2000 and his 2004 campaign and as part of his inner circle - until he publicly split with the president in 2006 over the Iraq war.

He also worked for Shriver's husband - taking a job on Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial reelection campaign.    

Shriver, 58, has been dating Dowd, 52, since last fall, according to the Washington Post - although Kennedy's wedding to Cheryl Hines appears to be their first public event together.

They both currently work in broadcasting. Dowd is an ABC political analyst and fixture on the Sunday talk shows. Shriver is a special 

Shriver - the niece of Robert F. Kennedy and President John F. Kennedy - was married to Schwarzenegger for 25 years until it was revealed that he had an affair with his maid and had fathered a child with her. She and Schwarzenegger have four children together. 

Dowd grew up in Detroit, Michigan, the son of an auto executive father and a school teacher mother. Dowd told the Times his family would have been upper-middle class - if his strict Irish Catholic parents hadn't had 11 children. 

Shriver and Dowd were first spotted out together last October. Both come from large Irish Catholic families - and both have a history of heartbreak

Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria are still legally married - though they have been separated since 2011 when he revealed that he had an affair with a maid and had a love child with her

He was an altar boy and even considered the priesthood - though, he told the Times, he liked girls too much. He has two grown sons with his first wife and a 12-year-old daughter Josephine with his second wife.

That marriage ended after his wife gave birth to twin girls in 2002. Josephine survived. Her sister died after two months in the hospital.

After he publicly criticized the Bush administration over its handling of gay marriage and the Iraq War, he left politics and moved to a ranch in rural Wimberly, Texas, an hour outside of Austin.

A Times reporter described his house as having more than 100 crosses. Above his fireplace, he has the Prayer of St. Francis: 'Lord, make me an instrument of your peace, where this hatred, let me sow love.'
