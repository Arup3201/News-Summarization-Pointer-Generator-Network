A friendly postman has been hailed a hero after he rescued an escaped hen - and left a delivery card for her owner saying there was '1 chicken' ready for collection.

Leanne Preston, from Congresbury in north Somerset, found the Royal Mail 'Something for you’ card from her postman when she returned home on Saturday.

On it the friendly postie had written that he had seen the chicken escaping through a hedge into a neighbouring garden at 1.15pm.

In the item description box, he had written, '1 chicken', and added that it could not be posted as 'it’s too large'.

Ms Preston described the chicken, called Windmill, as a  bit of a Houdini, an 'escape artist' who had been known to wander around before.

'My neighbours call her "the escapee" and will often call "Chicken alert!" over the hedge,' she said.

'They don’t mind at all and will often "post" her back through the hedge.'

Windmill was one of four ex-commercial caged hens Ms Preston has rehomed through hen charity, the British Hen Welfare Trust.

She added that, thanks to her 'lovely postie', Windmill had returned safely back to her coop, with all ending well.

'Our wandering chicken wandered back - all OK - and the hole in hedge has now been plugged,' Ms Preston said.

The card read: 'Saw your chicken escape through the hedge to the side of the building and go into 4B’s garden at 13.15.

'Number of items: 1 chicken. Could not be delivered because: it’s too large.'

A spokeswoman for the British Hen Welfare Trust said the Royal Mail card had sparked the interest of many on social media sites.

'Leanne posted the photo of the delivery card on the British Hen Welfare Trust’s Facebook page and on Twitter where the story has gathered quite a following,' she said.

'Royal Mail re-tweeted the news to its 44,000+ followers and say they are trying to trace the postman.'

The unusual card gathered a huge following on social media after Ms Preston posted a picture of it on the British Hen Welfare Trust’s Facebook page and on Twitter.

A spokesman for Royal Mail added: 'We are working to confirm the identity of the postman or postwoman.'
