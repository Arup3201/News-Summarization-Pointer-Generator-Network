Disgraced former NRL player Todd Carney says he is ready to deal with his drinking problems, but still feels resentful after his dismissal from the Cronulla Sharks.

The controversial footballer made a shameful exit from NRL in June, when the famous 'bubbler' scandal was the last nail in the coffin for the 28-year-old's career in Australia.

Carney says he is bitter about his dismissal and is adamant he will never return to NRL, declaring his new French club, Catalans Dragons, will be his last. 

'I've signed a three-year deal and I'd like to finish my career here and go on longer, after the three years,' Carney said during his first conference with French media. 

'I'm really going to get into that and the culture and make this my home for the rest of my career.'

He places the blame with Cronulla Sharks chief executive Steve Noyce for handing down a punishment the Carney believes he does not deserve. 

'I'm not cranky at the club but me and Steve Noyce didn't get along and I felt he was the final wound in the back for me,' Carney told Nine News.

Carney is adamant he would not have been dismissed if suspended Sharks coach Shane Flanagan had been at the club when the incident made headlines.  

Flanagan was suspended for 12 months in December 2013 over his involvement in the Cronulla Sharks supplement scandal.  

Carney made his first appearance with the club in front of French media on Monday

Carney is excited for a new beginning and has vowed to tackle his demons, after eight years of alcohol-related incidents which has had a devastating impact on his professional life

Since 2006, the playmaker has constantly made headlines for his off-field incidents, which saw him sacked from the Canberra Raiders, Sydney Roosters and Cronulla Sharks.

He insists he takes ownership for his poor judgement in the past, but believes his exile from NRL was unwarranted.

'I've always put my hand up,' he told reporters in France on Monday.

'I've obviously done the wrong thing.

'I may not have deserved the punishment I got, but to be here in France ... I'm not looking back.'

The 2010 Dally M award winner is ready for a new start in France with the Dragons, but knows the opportunity will be pointless unless he tackles his demons. 

'I'm going to work out what's best for me with counselling and just working out why these issues arise,' Carney told Nine News. 

Now that he has joined the Catalans Dragons, Carney will receive counselling from 'Sporting Chance', a clinic from former England and Arsenal captain Tony Adams, who overcame his own battle with alcoholism.

Alcohol was often a contributing factor to Carney's crimes, which included drink-driving and reckless driving offences, allegations of assault and indecent behaviour, as well as damage to public property. 

Carney admits that he still goes out to nightclubs and drinks with his mates, despite the extensive damage alcohol-related incidents have had on his professional and personal life.  

I'm not going to come out and say that I haven't drank cos that'd be a lie.'

He feels that being away from Australia will force him to be independent and learn self-respect.

'Being comfortable in my own self is the key,' Carney told Nine.   

Carney is certain suspended coach Shane Flanagan would have ensured the player remained with the club after the bubbler scandal, if Flanagan had still been in position

'In France there are going to be days where I'm not going to find no one and I'm going to have to find myself and that's who you need in the end.'   

The free-spirited playmaker, who built up a lengthy rap sheet during a chequered NRL career, said he planned to fully immerse himself in the French culture - and even vowed to learn the language.

That was an approach taken by Roosters coach Trent Robinson, who was in charge of the Dragons in 2011 and 2012 and played a significant role in convincing Carney that it would be the right place for him to rebuild his career.

'As soon as I get settled, I'll be taking (French) lessons,' said Carney, who will live with former Cronulla teammate Ben Pomeroy while he finds his own place.
