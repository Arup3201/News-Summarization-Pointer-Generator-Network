With breathtaking views across crystal clear waters, this is the £6,500-a-night bolthole laid on for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their forthcoming New Zealand tour.

Spectacularly situated, the lodge will offer the couple a luxurious – and no doubt rather romantic – interlude during their three-week tour of the Southern Hemisphere, which begins next month.

For just as on their recent trip to the Maldives, their son Prince George will be left behind with his new nanny, this time at the couple’s base in Wellington some 500 miles away.

Stunning views: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will enjoy a night's stay at an exclusive resort in New Zealand as part of their three-week tour of the Southern Hemisphere, which starts next month

Getaway: Kate and Wills will spend two nights away from their seven-month-old son Prince George during their trip to New Zealand and Australia. Breaking with tradition, the couple will base themselves in three cities - Sydney, Canberra and Wellington - rather than travel from city to city each day

William and Kate have designed their high-profile visit on behalf of the Queen on what is known as a ‘hub and spoke’ model.

Instead of hawking themselves from city to city, as is customary on overseas royal visits, they will base their young son in three cities: Wellington, Sydney and Canberra.

The arrangement means they will be able to travel back to him at the end of each working day, bar two unavoidable stop-overs.

Fortunately the view at their holiday spot is likely to take their mind off the distance. Priding itself as being the ‘perfect, private hideaway’, it has ten suites and villas, offering the royal couple complete seclusion. The entire resort has been booked out for their one-night stay.

William and Kate are expected to reside in the owner’s cottage, which boasts a private balcony for guests to admire the views of a lake and mountain range from the depths of its own Jacuzzi.

Styled by a leading local interior designer, it has a spacious main lounge, study, kitchen and dining room, as well as four expansive bedrooms with walk-in closets and in-room bars. Even the bathrooms offer uninterrupted views of the scenery.

The main lodge itself boasts a luxury spa, infinity swimming pool and sauna and fitness centre.

Royal base: Prince George will stay with his nanny at the royal base, and his parents will travel back to be with him each night, bar two unavoidable stop-overs

The rate for the cottage, which includes pre-dinner drinks with hors d’oeuvres, a seasonal gourmet dinner and full breakfast, is normally NZ$12,750 – almost £6,500.

Fortunately for New Zealand taxpayers, who are footing much of the bill for the tour, the lodge has been secured for a massively discounted rate of only a few hundred pounds for the night.

The couple will arrive at the lodge after a day of engagements – including a wine-tasting at the Amsfield vineyard and white water rafting on the Shotover river – before flying to Christchurch the next day.

That evening they will be reunited with George, who will stay at Government House in Wellington, where William stayed in 1983 during his own parents’ tour of the country. A source close to the duke and duchess said: ‘William and Katherine are hugely excited about the trip but made it clear from the start that they couldn’t bear to leave George behind.

‘They decided to model the tour on the way the Queen conducts hers. She tends to use one or two places as a base instead of moving from city to city, which also works for them with a young child.

Cosy: To preserve the couple's privacy the entire resort, which is made up of ten suites and villas, has been booked up for the night, at a discounted rate

‘They have managed to arrange it so that they spend only two nights away from their son and are keeping their fingers crossed that it will all work out OK.

'The only thing they are slightly concerned about is how George will cope with a 25-hour flight. They have warned people that although he is, generally, a really happy little boy, he might be a little bit grumpy the other end!’

Kensington Palace declined to comment on the location of the couple’s hotel for security reasons.

But a spokesman told the Daily Mail: ‘The New Zealand government has secured accommodation at very substantially reduced rates, which are actually equivalent to the cost of a room in a local hotel.’

An aide said the New Zealand government and local tourist board ‘recognise the extraordinary and positive public spotlight the visit will put on New Zealand and we have taken their recommendation in relation to this accommodation’.

On Thursday the couple returned from their first holiday without seven-month-old George, having spent a week at the five-star Cheval Blanc Randheli Resort in the Maldives.

The Mail revealed that George, accompanied by a heavy security detail, was being cared for by his grandparents, Michael and Carole Middleton, at their home.
