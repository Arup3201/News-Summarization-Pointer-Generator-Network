One of the new allegations brought against football coach Jerry Sandusky accuses him of abusing his own grandchild, according to his lawyer.

Sandusky, the former defensive coordinator for Penn State football team, is accused of molesting at least eight boys over a 15-year period.

His lawyer Joe Amendola said the accusation comes from the wife of one of Sandusky's five adopted sons.

Accused: Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky allegedly took high school pupils out of class in order to abuse them outside school grounds

Two new cases emerged yesterday, both referring to victims under the age of 18.

Amendola told ABC News: 'The allegations are ridiculous and unfounded. Jerry has absolutely denied any inappropriate contact with his grandkids.'

The incident was not reported to 
authorities until after Sandusky was charged earlier this month, he said.

Neither the person who made the complaint, nor the alleged victims, have been publicly identified.

Sandusky adopted a total of six children with his wife Dorothy.

If the two new allegations are found 
to be credible they will be the first involving alleged victims who are 
still under the age of 18.

Their accounts will be investigated by
the state's children and youth services rather than the police as they 
are classified as minors.

Sandusky, who maintains his innocence,
faces 40 criminal counts involving the sexual abuse of eight boys 
beginning in the mid-1990s.

The former football coach is free on bail, but has not been required to post any bail money.

Earlier this week a judge delayed his preliminary hearing in the Centre County Courthouse for three weeks until December 13.

Mr Amendola told 
ABC's Good Morning America he feared new criminal 
allegations would land his client in jail.

Meanwhile a grand jury indictment has revealed a shocking account by the mother of one former Central Mountain High School pupil.

'My concern is, if they bring new charges based upon new people coming forward, that bail's going to be set and he's going to wind up in jail'

She claims her son was frequently taken off school grounds by Sandusky despite no parental permission having been given.

According to the mother's account, the
school's principal Karen Probst repeatedly urged her not to report the 
abuse allegations to police.

She claims neither Ms Probst nor the 
school counsellor took his complaints seriously and she stormed 
out of a meeting when they refused to act.

She said of the principal and school counsellor: 'They were not helpful. They wanted me to go home and forget all about it.'

The mother, who has removed her son 
from the school, said he first met Sandusky in 2005 or 2006 through his 
children's charity aged 11 or 12.

She recalls meeting Sandusky at the 
charity's annual parent awards ceremony as well as frequently seeing him
hanging round the school.

She said towards the end of eighth
grade her son's behaviour changed and he began 'lashing out' and 
becoming 'mouthy and nasty at home’.

She said she was alerted to the 
possibility that something was seriously wrong one evening when her son 
asked her how to look up 'sex weirdos'.

Believing he was just playing a game she claims she asked him who he wanted to look up and he replied ‘Jerry’.

He then allegedly went on to tell her that he was being taken out of school several times a week, sometimes on a daily basis by Sandusky.

'I didn't know how to start the conversation with the high school counsellor because I didn't know how to come out and say: "I think Jerry Sandusky is doing something to my kid"'

Unidentified mother

According to both the alleged victim and his mother, football coach Steve Turchetta had authorised Sandusky to do this - despite no parental permission being given.

Realising the seriousness of the situation she states she arranged to meet with the school counsellor.

She said: 'I didn't know how to start 
the conversation with the high school counsellor because I didn't know 
how to come out and say: "I think Jerry Sandusky is doing something to 
my kid".

'I finally said to the counsellor "You're a mother. I'm a mother. I have a gut feeling that something isn't right".'

But she claims the school shrugged off her concerns, with principal Ms Probst saying: 'Jerry has a heart of gold.

'Jerry has a heart of gold. He's been around all these kids and you really should go home and think about what this is going to do to your son and your family if you do that'

‘He's been around all these kids and 
you really should go home and think about what this is going to do to 
your son and your family if you do that.’

Lawyers for one of the alleged 
victims, identified only as Victim 4, today requested for an injunction 
that would stop the children's charity that Sandusky founded The Second 
Mile from disbanding.

In the wake of allegations that 
Sandusky used the charity to get close to his victims, The Second Mile 
has said it was considering transferring its programs.

But Victim 4's lawyers said that they
want to make sure the company's assets are safeguarded. The criminal 
charges against Sandusky could be followed by civil lawsuits.

Lawyers Benjamin Andreozzi and 
Jeffrey Fritz said in a statement. 'We believe it is in the best 
interest of our clients, as well as the other victims, to ensure that 
the organization is being financially responsible.

'We have reached out to attorneys for
The Second Mile in the hope that appropriate safeguards against the 
dissipation of assets can be reached, but are proceeding with these 
legal measures in order to protect the interests of our clients and 
other victims in the event we are unable to come to an agreement,' the 
lawyers said.

The allegations have rocked Pennsylvania and led to the ousting of its celebrated football coach, Joe Paterno.

Aside from the case, Sandusky's defence lawyer Mr Amendola, 63, is said to have got a teenage girl called Mary Lavasile pregnant when she was 17 and he was 49, before later marrying her.

The age of consent in Pennsylvania is 16.
