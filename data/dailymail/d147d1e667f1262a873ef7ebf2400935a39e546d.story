The Green Party now has overtaken UKIP to become Britain’s fourth biggest party, new figures revealed today.

Some 2,000 activists joined the party overnight, taking its membership to 43,829 – almost 2,000 more than UKIP and just 700 shy of the Liberal Democrats.

The revelation will renew calls for Green Party leader Natalie Bennett to be included in TV election debates ahead of the May 7 poll. 

It comes as Ed Miliband used a speech on climate change this morning to shore up Labour's vote ahead of the election, amid growing fears  that the Greens are syphoning off its traditional supporters.

Mr Miliband told activists in north London that the green agenda and a desire to reduce inequality were ‘at the heart of my beliefs’.

In a thinly-veiled swipe at Mr Cameron, the Labour leader said that fighting climate change was not ‘part of a branding exercise’ but were the reason he entered politics.

He said ‘tackling climate change is the most important thing I can do in politics for my children's generation’.

Mr Miliband, however, has insisted the proposed TV election debates should go ahead without the Greens after the media regulator Ofcom ruled they were not a 'major' party. 

But David Cameron has insisted he will not take part in the head-to-head debates unless the Greens are invited.

Natalie Bennett, Green Party in England and Wales leader, said any debate would be ‘unrepresentative’ if the Greens were not included and that the party was talking to lawyers about possible legal action.

Labour is still the largest party in terms of number of members – with an estimated 190,000 activists. The Conservatives are the second biggest party – with 149,800 members.

But, following a surge in members following the independence referendum, the third biggest party is now the SNP with 92,000 followers.

The party is expected to have more than 100,000 registered supporters by the May election – ten times more than its membership in 2003.

It comes as a new poll shows the Green party is neck-and-neck with the Conservatives among voters aged 18-24.

David Cameron (left),  Nick Clegg (centre) and the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown clashed in the final leaders' election debate, hosted by  the BBC in  Birmingham just a week before the general election in 2010

Both parties were on 22 per cent in December, behind Labour on 32 per cent.

The Lib Dems, who traditionally banked on a high level of support from young voters, have plummeted to 5 per cent, with Ukip on 13 per cent.

The figures are likely to be jumped on by Mr Cameron, who is refusing to take part in televised leaders’ debates unless the Greens are included.

Mr Cameron has been accused of making ‘pathetic excuses’ to dodge a TV showdown with Labour, the Lib Dems and Ukip.

But the Prime Minister reiterated that the Greens must be involved in the sessions if Ukip are - and suggested the Liberal Democrats should have their role downgraded because they are only a ‘minor’ party.

But in bruising clashes in the Commons, Ed Miliband deployed Margaret Thatcher's famous barb by branding Mr Cameron ‘frit’.

The Labour leader pointed out that in 2010 Mr Cameron had condemned ‘feeble’ reasons for backing out of debates, and said ‘no-one believed’ his protests were genuine now.

‘It is frankly a pathetic excuse. It is not for him, it is not for me, it is not for any party leader to decide who is in the debate. It is up to the broadcasters, that is the country we live in,’ Mr Miliband said.

‘Is he really telling the people of Britain that he is going to seek to deny them the TV debate if he doesn't get to choose who is in them?’

Mr Cameron hit back that Mr Miliband was ‘chicken’ for being unwilling to face off against Green Party leader Natalie Bennett as well as Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Ukip's Nigel Farage.

‘I'm all for these debates but you cannot have two minor parties without the third minor party. Why is he frightened of debating the Green Party?’

The Tory leader indicated that he believed there should be two debates, rather than the three currently floated by the broadcasters.

‘There are two credible sets of debates. You can either have a debate with all the national parties who appear in this House,’ he said.

‘Or you can have a debate ... between the two people who would become Prime Minister. Those are the credible debates.’
