No one could accuse Tinker Bell of being too big for her boots.

The week-old Ouessant lamb is thought to be the world’s smallest sheep.

Weighing just 2lbs and only 10 inches long, the creature is barely bigger than a pint glass.

When it arrived two weeks prematurely at a farm in Durham last week, the lamb could not stand and had to be bottle-fed every three hours by its owners.

Tinker Bell is just 0.2lbs lighter than Bobby, a lamb born in April last year that was so tiny it was given the title as the world’s smallest lamb.

Tinker Bell arrived last week at the Adventure Valley farm park, where owner Janine Calzini keeps a small flock of Ouessant sheep, the smallest naturally occurring breed in the world.

Mrs Calzini said: ‘Our four Ouessant ewes were due to lamb next week but one went into labour early.

‘She was struggling so we had to help pull the lamb out. I thought the lamb was dead, she wasn’t moving. I rubbed her and then she slowly opened her eyes.

‘Usually they try to stand up straight away but she was just lying there. We didn’t think she was going to make it.

‘We called the vet in straight away and he gave her a booster.’ Henry Sheen, a vet from the Cestria surgery in Chester le Street, near Durham, said: ‘It was the smallest newborn lamb I’ve ever seen, by far.

‘I put a tube in its stomach to give it some colostrum (first milk), which is full of antibodies, to boost its immune system and get its stomach ticking over.’

Mrs Calzini added: ‘As she was two weeks’ premature her mother didn’t have milk for her so we had to bottle feed her every three hours, but with a lot of love and care from my 10-year-old daughter Alessia and the rest of the Adventure Valley team we have been able to nurse her back to health.

‘We decided to call her Tinker Bell because of her size.’

Lambs should generally weigh between 3kg (6.6lbs) and 5kg (11lbs) when they are born.Vet Matt Colston, from the Sheep Veterinary Society, said the survival rate for lambs drops dramatically when they are born weighing less than 3kg.

‘When they are this small they’re often not strong enough for the first feed,’ he said.

‘They have a large surface area to volume ratio so they’re prone to getting cold, so they need a good strong first feed, and then to feed often, otherwise they get hypothermia.’

The Ouessant breed comes from the small French island of the same name, which is situated 18 miles off the coast of Brittany.

Believed to be the smallest breed of sheep in the world, Ouessants stand just 18 inches high compared to more common breeds, which are between 24 inches and 36 inches tall on average.

Most Oessants are black or brown, but they can be white as well.

Mrs Calzini, who has kept the breed on her farm for four years, said: ‘They’ve got a funny look - like a ball of fluff with these spindly legs.

'As soon as I saw one I just fell in love with it and knew I wanted to keep them.’ Tinker Bell is now a week old and strong enough to meet visitors, but is still only 12 inches tall and weighs just 4lbs.

She is with her mother and the other ewes in the indoor farmyard where visitors can see them.

Bobby, thought to be the previous smallest lamb in the world, weighed 2.2lbs when he was born at Fishers Farm Park in West Sussex in April last year. He died the same month.
