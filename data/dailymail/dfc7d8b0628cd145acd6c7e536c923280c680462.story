It's good while it lasts. Adoring crowds, glittering black-tie events and lucrative opportunities to spin turntables in nightclubs, open supermarkets or turn on Christmas tree lights.

However, when the showbiz spotlight dims, what happens to those faces who once graced our television screens on a regular basis can seem relatively cruel... they have to get a proper job.

Pictures emerged this week of Daniella Westbrook, once the darling of the Queen Vic pub in EastEnders, pulling pints to make ends meet in a real-life London boozer.

Star of the bar: Former Eastenders actress Daniella Westbrook has been doing shifts at The Bill Nicholson pub in Tottenham, North London. Daniella tweeted that the pub work made her feel 'useful'

Daniella, 41, has been putting in shifts behind the bar at The Bill Nicholson in Tottenham. Describing her new vocation on Twitter, the out-of-work actress said: 'I help my mate at her pub @thebillnicn17 it makes me feel useful and I laugh all day.'

Daniella, who was cast as Peggy Mitchell's daughter Sam in EastEnders when she was just 16, famously battled a cocaine addiction which forced her septum, the bridge under the nose, to collapse.

In recent years, the actress has appeared on reality television and even had a stint in Los Angeles, but is now keeping herself busy in the footballing pub, a stone's throw from the Spurs ground.

Daniella isn't the only famous face forced to roll up her sleeves and get a real job though. 

Westlife hearthrob Mark Feehily, who once toured the globe as part of Irish supergroup Westlife, has been spotted brewing up coffees and selling crepes in his foodie van, which parks up at festivals. 

Although the singer is about to embark on a solo singing career, Mark - now preferring to be called Markus, is proud of his tea-making skills.

Former life: The singer (second from left) was one quarter of Irish supergroup Westlife, which had seven number one albums and toured the globe

From Platt to that: Sean Wilson, who trod the cobbles of Weatherfield as Martin Platt (pictured with onscreen wife Gail, left) for 21 years has turned his hand to cheese-making with the Saddlesworth Cheese Company 

He told the Mirror: 'It's my business and I love it, anything I get involved in I get involved 110%.

'A couple of Irish people came up and were like "Wait a minute, what are you doing in a van?"

'I love festivals, so why not?'

He's not the only one serving up culinary delights. Former actor Sean Wilson, who played Martin Platt in Coronation Street for 21 years, is now making cheese for a living. Sean swapped the cobbles of Weatherfield for a role in the Saddlesworth Cheese Company based in Lancashire. 

Eighties' television heroes who turned to alternative careers when the work dried up have included Tom Watt, who graced the screens as asthmatic Lofty in EastEnders, and is now a football writer and Zammo from Grange Hill, who keeps people secure with a locksmith and key-cutting shop in Surrey.

A long way from the classrooms of Grange Hill: Lee McDonald aka Zammo, star of the hit 'Just Say No' teen drugs campaign in the Eighties, now runs a locksmith and key-cutting shop in Surrey 

Other stars who've opted to earn an honest fee rather than twiddling their thumbs: Holby City star Jeremy Edwards turned to manual labour in 2011 and (right) Adele Silva took a job in Ted Baker on Melrose Avenue after a stint hunting acting work in LA didn't work out

Former Holby City star Jeremy Edwards, 44, also admitted that he's not afraid to get his hands dirty when the fickle finger of fame isn't pointing in his direction. 

Back in 2011, Jeremy was spotted hauling bricks into a skip in London in a bid to fill in the gaps between working. He said at the time: 'I really don't see the shame in manual labour. I don't know any actors who work consistently without other work.

He added: 'There's a lucky few, but not many, I had a good ten-year run!' 

One-time Emmerdale starlet Adele Silva might have been on the receiving end of fashion freebies at the height of her soap career. 

A failed attempt to make it across the pond in Hollywood saw the actress forced to resort to a plan B...working as an assistant at a Ted Baker store on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. 

She said at the time: 'I'm a jobbing actress and in this climate you can either sell your soul or do an honest day's work.' Adele, 34, is now back in the UK and expecting her first child.
