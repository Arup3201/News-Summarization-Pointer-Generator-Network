Shock: Gary Lawton, 46, died as he tried to steal copper from an electricity substation, an inquest heard

A metal thief was killed by a 33,000-volt shock as he tried to steal copper from an electricity substation, an inquest heard.

Father-of-three Gary Lawton, 46, was left for dead by at least one accomplice after being injured.

It was several hours later before his body was found by an engineer who went to investigate a fault at the scene in Chesterton, Staffordshire.

The inquest was told unemployed Mr Lawton had told his partner that he and a friend had found themselves a 'nice little earner' in the hours before he died.

Although police believe he was not alone when he targeted the substation, there was not enough evidence to arrest anyone in connection with the raid.

Coroner Ian Smith condemned the thief who left Mr Lawton, from Hanley, Staffordshire, to die.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, he said: 'Gary was up to no good, he was out to steal copper. It is clear to me another person, possibly more, were involved.

'I am satisfied they did not cause or want Gary's death, but equally they weren't man or men enough to remain at the scene and tell the police what had happened or assist paramedics.'

The inquest heard Mr Lawton's body was found next to a concrete pillar after the raid on April 25.

A ladder was found nearby and a bolt-cutter, used to cut through metal, was also next to him.

Scenes of crime officer Marcus Barber, from Staffordshire Police, said: 'Thick copper earthing strips run down the outside of the concrete.

'That particular concrete pylon was missing copper from quite a height. There were many other pylons with damage to them.'

Around half a dozen two-foot long pieces of copper had been piled up by the substation's perimeter fence.

Mr Lawton, who had three children with partner Donna Eagles, was pronounced dead at the scene.

He had suffered burns and abrasions to various parts of his body. A post-mortem examination gave his cause of death as electrocution.

A spokesman for Western Power urged people to keep out of electricity substations.

'Substations are lethal and the thieves are dicing with death for very small reward,' he said.
