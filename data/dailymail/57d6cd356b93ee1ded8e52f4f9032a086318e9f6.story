It couldn’t last. Manchester United have won six successive games whilst producing some awfully mediocre football, some of it downright shambolic.

Normally you get what deserve but Louis van Gaal’s team have been getting away with a little more than that of late.

Against Aston Villa, reality returned. United were decidedly average in the first half and a little better in the second but they weren’t good enough to break down ten men. Any committed Premier League team with a well-executed game plan is a test for United at present and so it proved.

Radamel Falaco returned to the starting eleven for the first time since early October; he partnered Robin van Persie. Angel Di Maria would come off the bench later. In fact United could field such an array of attacking players they could even afford to put Wayne Rooney in midfield. But still they could not overwhelm Villa, nor, in that lame first-half, could they register a significant shot on goal.

Van Gaal at least does not hide behind blandness. ‘When you want to be a part of the title race then you have to win these games,’ he said. ‘We dropped two points. We were the better team and that’s frustrating when you don’t win these games. We were not so aggressive in the first half as usual. We kept the ball much better but we didn’t create so much because we were not looking to the forwards

‘We were not creative enough in the second half; we didn’t keep the ball as well as in the first half but we had more aggression, so that was the plus. OK we have a draw but that’s why I’m a little bit frustrated because we could have won this game, we didn’t do it and we are responsible.’

Villa were so well set up by Paul Lambert, so clear in their intent and decisive in their tactics, that there was never a question of being swept aside. Even when they controversially lost Gabriel Agbonlahor to a red card on 65 minutes, there was no capitulation.

Throughout the team there were excellent performances. Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph shone, as did Agbonlahor until his early departure. Ron Vlaar was the mainstay of van Gaal’s back three at the World Cup in the summer; he put the experience to good use on Saturday, frustrating his former national team boss at the heart of Villa’s own three-man defence.

Paul Lambert had chosen to ape van Gaal’s formation to counter United and Vlaar stood out, cajoling, organising and intercepting as United were kept at bay in those opening exchanges. Van Gaal’s team kept the ball nicely in periods; they rarely did anything with it.

‘I thought we were excellent considering everything that’s been against us this week,’ said Lambert. ‘We had seven lads out due to injury and suspension. Our bench was like a kindergarten but the performance was absolutely terrific.’

Indeed Lambert’s players executed instructions perfectly, swamping United’s attacks leaving Agbonlahor as the man with the speed to transform their defensive moments into swift counter attacks.

That said, for Villa’s opener on 18 minutes though United had plenty of time to defend; they just failed to do so. Delph floated in a delightful free kick and Christian Benteke took it down superbly, though Jonny Evans was weak challenging and closing down.

It would be churlish to dwell on the negatives; having found his half yard of space benteke curled the ball around Evans, finding a gap at the far post in which to squeeze the ball, leaving David de Gea helpless. ‘An absolute world class goal,’ said Lambert.

Half-time saw Darren Fletcher sacrificed for Tyler Blackett so Michael Carrick could push on in midfield; United desperately needed some passing guile in that area.

Yet it was Villa who made the more immediate impression, De Gea required to be at his superb best to tip over a firm Benteke header from a corner on 48 minutes. United did ultimately demonstrate significantly more intent in the second half. Guzan had to push away a close-range Robin van Persie shot on 51 minutes and then, on 54 minutes, came Falcao’s moment.

Young was now making a habit of getting past Lowton and did so again sending in an excellent cross which Falcao, leaning backwards, met firmly and decisively to equalise. Scored by a Colombian, it was the most English of goals and Falcao greeted his second goal for the club rapturously, charging towards the United fans and sparking a mini pitch invasion.

‘It was a beautiful goal and I liked him today and I’m very happy for him,’ said van Gaal, while offering no clues as to whether he would keep his place.

Villa though were not immediately cowed. Indeed, their biggest setback came on 65 minutes when Young and Agbonlahor clashed for the ball. Young won it while Agbonlahor was late and came through the man but not with his foot raised. Both players had attacked the ball aggressively but only referee Lee Mason saw it as a red card. ‘If that s a red card we may as well just pack up as it won’t be a game of football’ said Lambert. ‘

Yet Villa did not fold and United are still not what they were. Villa changed their shape to accommodate and they kept United at bay. Indeed, on 87 minutes, a dipping, swerving shot from substitute Leonardo Bacuna might have won them the game. And in the dying seconds, Charles N’Zogbia was inches away from turning in a cross. It was not to be. But a point with ten men felt almost as good.
