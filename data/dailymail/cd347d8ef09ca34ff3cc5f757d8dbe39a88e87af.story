Quick exit: Redknapp is seen leaving the court at the end of yesterday's proceedings. He had hoped to attend his team's league match with Liverpool but his flight was cancelled

Harry Redknapp and his former chairman were compared to Hollywood's 'odd couple' yesterday as the tax evasion case against them was branded 'repugnant.'

The Tottenham manager and Milan Mandaric were compared to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as defence barrister Lord Ken Macdonald QC attacked the Crown's case.

Southwark Crown Court heard the pair had an 'emotional relationship, at times a tempestuous relationship, at times a love-hate relationship.'

Lord Macdonald said there were times when former Portsmouth chairman Mandaric 'loved Harry' and other times when he wanted to 'strangle him.'

They are an 'odd couple, different men, different backgrounds... but I would suggest a deep affection' Lord Macdonald said.

'Mr Mandaric had no fear describing his emotions towards Mr Redknapp, he said he loves them.'

They are an 'odd couple, a bit like the old film' he added.

Mandaric, 73, is accused of making two payments totalling more than £189,000 to Redknapp between 2002 and 2004 as bonuses when he was manager of Portsmouth FC.

It is claimed the pair attempted to avoid taxes by having the money paid into Redknapp's off shore Monaco bank account named Rosie 47 after his pet bulldog.

Both men deny the charges.

Redknapp's defence barrister John Kelsey-Fry QC also attacked the prosecution case saying 'there is an inherent absurdity that shrieks out at you.'

He questioned why the prosecution had branded Redknapp, 64, 'greedy' when he had turned down a payment of £130,000 when he left Portsmouth.

And he ridiculed claims Redknapp was a 'hard headed businessman' after the court heard evidence of his 'disastrous' financial investments.

Mr Kelsey-Fry then attacked the 'crucial lynchpin' of the prosecution case, a recorded interview with News of the World journalist Rob Beasley.

In the recording made in February 2009 Redknapp says the first payment of £93,100 was a bonus for the sale of the player Peter Crouch.

Mr Kelsey-Fry said the Crown was relying on the 'primarily despicable' evidence gathered for a newspaper 'front page'.

Business dealings: Lord Macdonald told the court about Mandaric's deals with high profile figures such as late Apple boss Steve Jobs, claiming Jobs 'would not work with fools'

Mr Kelsey-Fry said: 'I do not shrink from suggesting to you it is repugnant to all our basic instincts of fairness in the criminal justice process.'

Referring to interviews carried out Mr Beasley in February 2009, Mr Kelsey-Fry said: 'They saw a great story, all's fair in love and war and the News of the World.'

Mr Kelsey-Fry also claimed there was a flurry of bets made on Redknapp being sacked in the days before the News of the World eventually published allegations against him and Mandaric in October 2009.

He also said odds betting odds for Redknapp being the next Premier League manager to be sacked plunged from 50-1 to evens on the Friday before the story was published on the Sunday.

Earlier in the day Lord Macdonald highlighted Mandaric's multi-billion pound business dealings with high profile figures such as the late boss of Apple Steve Jobs.

'Steve Jobs doesn't work with fools' the former Director of Public Prosecutions said.

Lord Macdonald said it was 'desperate stuff' to suggest Mandaric would have made the second off shore payment to Redknapp just days after increasing the value of his contract from £3m to £4.2m.

He said: 'Why would he follow up a £1.18m increase with an additional $150,000?'

Lord Macdonald said that while $150,000 (£96,300) was a large sum to most people Mandaric was 'inhabiting a universe where the perspective is different.'

He told jurors not to let the fact of the two men's wealth escape them.

Support: Redknapp is seen outside court following the evidence with his son Jamie

Mr Kelsey-Fry detailed the bonuses in Redknapp's contract relating to achieving promotion to the Premier League and maintaining Pompey's top flight status.

He said Redknapp gained a £300,000 rise in his basic salary from £500,000 to £800,000 when he secured promotion in 2003 along with a £400,000 bonus.

Redknapp was also contracted to get a further £200,000 for securing the Premier League staus of Portsmouth in 2004 along with ten per cent of the club's Merit Award of £4,360,000.

Mr Kelsey-Fry said it would 'offend common sense' for Redknapp to have paid tax on profit related bonuses of around £1.5m and then refuse to pay tax on a further £100,000.

The case continues.
