The grandmother from the Morayfield 'house of horrors' case will apply for bail next week after being charged with four counts of attempted murder involving two boys, aged nine and 11.

Police told a court the 58-year-old Caboolture woman tried to suffocate the elder grandchild with a tea towel and a pillow, according to reports.

Detectives also allege he and his nine-year-old brother were deliberately trapped in a house fire which badly damaged the family's Morayfield home in February 2014.

The pair managed to escape however one suffered burns to his legs.

The woman has been charged with two counts of attempted murder and one of arson in relation to the blaze, but she also faces two additional attempted murder charges stemming from other incidents.

She has also been charged with one count of interfering with a corpse in relation to the death of a seven-month-old infant from the same family in September. 

She is still assisting police with their investigations into the alleged homicide of the infant, as well as the baby's three-year-old sibling in July 2013.  

The deaths of the three-year-old and the seven-month old were initially treated as SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) cases, police said.   

When asked whether there could be further charges laid, Detective Senior Sergeant Tony Green told reporters: 'All I'm saying at this stage is the investigation is ongoing.'

'The investigation is still ongoing in regards to those two children and also the charges that are currently before the court,' he said. 

The grandmother was remanded to custody at Maroochydore Local Court on Wednesday and will reappear on Monday. 

The alleged crimes all occurred at a home in Morayfield, toward the Sunshine Coast north of Brisbane

No one in the 'mindboggling' series of alleged crimes committed at Morayfield, north of Brisbane, can be identifed. This picture shows the father of a toddler who died in July last year. 

Father and son: The father of a three-year-old boy police believe was murdered in a crime linked to his grandmother wants justice for the dead toddler. 

The father of a toddler police believe was murdered on July 27 last year at the birth of his son.

In an interview with Nine News earlier this month, the grandmother said: 'I'm totally shattered. I'm not capable of doing anything like that.'  

Police said earlier this month the pair are not suspected of being involved and they have told of their grief at losing two children.  

After police went public with the investigation in early December, the father of the two surviving boys said: 'It shocks me. I'm disgusted.

'I fear for their lives every day. I don't know what's going to happen next.'

Meanwhile the father of the three-year-old police believe was murdered in the same house in July 2013 called for 'justice for his 'little buddy''.  

His seven-month-old half-brother was found dead at the same address on September 27 2014.

Until earlier this month, the father of the three-year-old believed his son had died of complications from a virus. 

After the revelations, he called for justice for all of the boys.

'I just want to know what happened to my son,' he said. 'He was my little buddy.'

The man changed his Facebook profile to feature a picture of his son below the words: 'Justice for (the boy's name)'. 

He had also written the message: 'Justice for all 4. 3 other boys went though hell to so please dont forget about them'. 

Police this week called the investigation 'difficult and protracted'.
