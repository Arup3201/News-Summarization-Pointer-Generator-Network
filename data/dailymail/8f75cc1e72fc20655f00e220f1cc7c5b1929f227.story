Professional golfer Bubba Watson has put down the golf clubs and picked up the microphone.

Watson - who is currently fourth in the world golf rankings - has released a hilarious new Christmas rap video in which he assumes his festive-season alter ego named Bubba Claus.

In it, alongside an elvish crew, he raps about his golf hovercraft, delivering gifts on a John Deere tractor, his Christian faith and his son's inability to sleep on Christmas Eve.

In the song, the golfer asks the listeners if they are curious whether he has golf clubs or toys in his bag

The rap song also features the mundane. Watson describes in detail Christmas as a child, where his mother cooks in the kitchen while he and his dad are 'chilling' in the living room

The song, titled 'The Single', is firmly tongue-in-cheek, with lyrics also detailing mundane details of Christmas in his home of Bagdad, Florida as a child.

His mother, he raps, is cooking something on the stove, while his father is chilling in the living room as his sister plays on the floor.

Watson is one of the more colourful characters on the professional golf circuit.

He is a member of the Golf Boys, a boy band consisting of Watson, Ben Crane, Rickie Fowler and Hunter Maham.

In recent years, he's also heavily promoted his golf cart hovercraft.

The vehicle, named the BW1, has been promoted by the golfer as being able to drive through water features and across sand traps.

Watson tweeted his excitement about his new song

I remember Christmas growing up in Bagdad, chilling in the living room with my dad,

Momma in the kitchen got food in the stove, sister in the living room playing on the floor,

I used to hit the golf course take me a swing, got my first clubs since boy was a teen,

Kids in their room they can't even go to sleep, 'cos they know I'm coming through putting gifts under the tree.

 

No sweat, no beer, no reindeer, I might come deliver gifts on a John Deere,

Caleb asked me to bring him a new ball, but I'm checking my list it's Bubba Claus.

 

Just touched down in my hovercraft,

I bet you want to know what's in my bag,

Is it golf clubs or a bag of toys? 

It's a bird, it's a plane, it's Bubba Claus.

I gotta thank God he's the reason I made it, I thank him every day for the moves that I make,

Thank you baby Jesus he was born in a manger, 'cos he knew when I was born I was gonna be the saviour,

Thank you for the clothes and the shoes on my feet, thank you for my kids and the food that I eat,

Thank you for my wife and the house where we sleep, I wake up everyday and I put it on repeat.
