The service of millions of unknown soldiers will ‘forever be part of our national consciousness’, David Cameron has said in a moving letter to those who fought and died in the First World War.

The Prime Minister penned the evocative letter as part of a project to connect today’s generation with the sacrifice of those sent into battle a century ago.

In his letter, Mr Cameron tells the young soldier how ‘our world would have been far darker if you had declined the call to act’.

The letter was released as the PM hosted a reception in the Downing Street garden or veterans, secondary school pupils and representatives from organisations involved in marking the centenary

Thousands of people have already written their own tribute, inspired by a statue on platform one at Paddington Station of an Unknown Soldier reading a letter.

It is one of many tributes to the thousands of soldiers who died in the battlefield, and never came home.

More than 6,000 people have already submitted letters, including thousands of schoolchildren and authors Stephen Fry, Andrew Motion, Sheila Hancock and Andy McNab.

Organisers say 'it's a striking way to make a personal and permanent mark on this centenary'. 

In his letter Mr Cameron says the one soldier stands for the ‘millions of young British men who have fought to defend our freedoms and for the millions of us left behind who will be forever in debt to the extraordinary service and sacrifice of your generation’.

He writes how the names of soldiers who fought and died will be recorded on war memorials ‘across the land’, and plays, poetry, monuments and art works will honour and celebrate them.

The letter, part of 14-18Now commemoration project, was released Mr Cameron hosted a lunchtime reception in Downing Street for veterans, secondary school pupils and representatives from organisations involved in marking the centenary.

The Prime Minister writes how the names of thousands of soldiers would be honoured on war memorials across the country, adding: 'Your service will forever be part of our national consciousness'

The Prime Minister paints a picture of millions of ‘angry, sad or afraid’ young men leaving Britain in the hope it would be a short war.

‘When you left our shores you did so with hope and purpose. Posing proudly in your uniform, you had a sense of mission and perhaps even of adventure,’ he writes.

‘You knew that you were volunteering to help your country fight a just cause. You did so eagerly, with honour and with the expectation that you might well be home by Christmas.

‘Today as you read this letter you know, better than we can ever imagine, the monumental horror and suffering of this War.’

The government has urged schools to get involved in a number of projects marking the outbreak of the war in 1914

A £5 million fund will help conserve Britain’s First World War memorials.

The cash will be taken from Libor fines paid by bank to repair and protect memorials and graves across the UK and oversea.

The War Memorials Trust, which looks after memorials in the UK, will receive up to £3 million over the four-year period of the First World War Centenary to boost support for its grant schemes and expand a team of specialist Conservation Officers.

Imperial War Museums will receive £500,000 to develop a website, delivered by August 4 this year, to help communities find out where information about war memorials can be found.

By 2018 the site is hoped to be a fully-searchable, free, national register of all recorded First World War memorials in the UK, allowing people to find out where their relatives may be commemorated.

As part of today’s announcement, English Heritage will receive £500,000 to provide better protection for war memorials by tripling the number of listed war memorials; delivering a larger pool of specialists to repair memorials; and developing an education toolkit for schools so pupils can research their local memorials. 

Mr Cameron said: 'As we reflect on the events that saw so many people make the ultimate sacrifice, I believe it is vital that we ensure our memorials are fitting tributes to the fallen.'

Almost every family was touched by tragedy during the war, Mr Cameron adds. ‘So many friends have been lost; so many loved ones snatched away from us in their prime.’

He goes on: ‘But be in no doubt: however dark this time of War - our World would have been far darker if you had declined the call to act.

‘Without your service, our security, our values, our very way of life would have been lost.’

More than 6million British men were mobilised during the war, and more than 700,000 were killed.

The letter writing project is one of many launched to mark the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of the conflict on July 28 1914.

In his letter, Mr Cameron tells the soldier: ‘Know too, that from your toil and sacrifice there will in time be a better world. It will not happen immediately.

‘There will be yet more unthinkable horrors along the way. But one hundred years from now your grandchildren and great-grandchildren will enjoy a peace in Europe and a quality of life that is almost unimaginable.’

Some of the world’s great advances were made by the generation which fought during the Great War, the PM adds.

‘Your bravery and selfless determination will never be forgotten. 

'Your name - and the names of your fellow servicemen - will be celebrated on memorials in villages, schools, churches and universities across the land. 

‘Plays and poetry will honour you. Paintings and monuments will depict you. Ceremonies will be inspired by you. Thousands will write about you, many will even write to you a hundred years from now.

‘So as you go from here, know that you are in our hearts. Your service will forever be part of our national consciousness. We are humbled by what you have given for us and we will never forget you.’
