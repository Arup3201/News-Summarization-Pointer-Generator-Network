A dog who was found starving on the streets with a coffee can around her neck is making a remarkable recovery from the horrific ordeal.

Olivia was pictured two weeks after being  found wandering the streets in Dallas with a coffee can jammed around her neck.

The bottom and the top circular 
portions of the can had been removed and the remaining tube forced over her head. The edges of the can had cut into the dog’s neck, preventing her from eating for days or even weeks.

Road to recovery: Olivia the dog, who was found two weeks ago wandering Dallas with a coffee can around her neck, is improving after several surgeries

Pitiful: The starving dog may not have eaten for weeks, say rescuers, when she was found on the streets of Dallas

When a Good Samaritan found the emaciated dog, it became clear that the coffee can had been on  for a long time because her skin had grown around the edges of the can.

After the veterinarians cut the can off Java’s neck, the dog was taken to Metro Paws Animal Hospital.

She has been nursed back to health by the dedicated volunteers at Animal Allies of Texas.

Olivia has gained eleven pounds after having mutiple surgeries. The team believe that she also gave birth during the time she spent with the can around her neck but there was no sign of the dog's litter.

It has yet to be decided when Olivia will be put up for adoption. Volunteers wrote on their Facebook page:
'We can see the Shepherd lineage in this beautiful girl. Looking 
forward to her coat coming in.'

Cruel: The dog was unable to eat because the edges of the can gouged into her neck

Care: The can is painstakingly cut away from Java's neck by Animal Allies of Texas

The dog, who was nicknamed Java at first by rescuers, had every one of severely emaciated ribs visible when she was first found.

‘Her body had tried to grow over the can,’ a spokesman from the Animal Allies of Texas told the Dallas News.

One of the worst injuries was to an ear, which was nearly severed by the sharp edge of the rusting can.
