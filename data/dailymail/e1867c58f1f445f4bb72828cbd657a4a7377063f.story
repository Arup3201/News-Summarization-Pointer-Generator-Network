A spitfire stands forlorn as a wing is removed from its fuselage.

But far from heading for the scrapheap, this Mk 1 plane, which flew in the Battle of Britain, is in safe hands.

The people examining its amputated 'limb' are conservation officers from the Imperial War Museum in London.

After years of being suspended from the ceiling of the museum, the aircraft was today being prepared for transfer to the IWM in Duxford, Cambridgeshire.

The plane will be conserved and displayed in Duxford, Cambs, while the museum, in Lambeth, south-east London, is closed from January 2 to July 1 next year

The Spitfire entered service in 1938 with No.19 Squadron and flew in the Battle of Britain during the summer and autumn of 1940

It will be conserved and displayed there while the museum, in Lambeth, south-east London, is closed from January 2 to July 
1 next year for a major refurbishment. 

The tourist attraction is set for a £35million makeover which will see the whole of the lower ground floor concentrating on the First World War - due to raised public awareness following shows such as Downton Abbey and Birdsong.

Workmen also removed a First World War German Mast Periscope from the London site.

It was used for looking over obstacles 30-85ft in height and could easily be transported on its carriage.

Some 21,000 Spitfires were built during and after the Second World War, although most were sold off for scrap in the early 1950s due to a shortage of metal

The emergence of the jet engine also hastened the demise of the propeller-powered aircraft

More than 20,000 Spitfires were built in 24 different marks.

It first flew in the RAF in 1938 and was retired by 1957.

One of the proposed names for the fighter was 'The Shrew'.

Its designer RJ Mitchell only lived long enough to see the prototype fly in 1937.

During the mid-1950s, many Mk 22 planes were sold to the Egyptian and Syrian air forces.

The Battle of Britain was the German air force's attempt to gain air superiority over the RAF from July to September 1940.

It was one of the turning points of World War Two and prevented Germany from invading Britain.

The battle began in mid-July with Luftwaffe concentrating on attacking shipping in the English Channel and attacking coastal towns and defences.

From August 12, Hermann Goering, one of the leaders of the Nazi regime, shifted his focus to the destruction of the RAF, attacking airfields and radar bases.

Convinced that Fighter Command was now close to defeat, he also tried to force air battles between fighter planes to break British strength.

However, Goering grew frustrated by the large number of British planes that were still fighting off his attacks.

Luftwaffe switched tactics again and, on Hitler's orders, set about destroying London and other major cities.

Eleven days later, on what became 'Battle of Britain Day', the RAF decimated the huge incoming Luftwaffe formations in the skies above London and the south coast.
