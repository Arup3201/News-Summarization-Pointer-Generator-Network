Former Manchester United striker Dwight Yorke believes Louis van Gaal's side have what it takes to become Premier League champions.

Speaking to Sky Sports, the former Trinidad and Tobago captain explained his thoughts on United's title credentials, also explaining the importance of getting a win at the Britannia Stadium.

'I have every belief in this United team,' he said. 'They seem to understand the philosophy and what it takes to be champions. These are the kind of games [Stoke] where, if you have any aspiration to challenge for the top two, you have to come and get a result.'

Louis van Gaal's side sat third in the Premier League going into the new year, but it is their home form that has propelled them up the league. At Old Trafford, United have won six of their eight games, losing one, while away from home six matches have produced just one win.

Yorke admits that, if United are to find success in their quest for the Premier League, their form on the road must improve:

'Yeah, absolutely,' the former United man said. 'Winning the Premier League is not easy, coming to places like Stoke at the Britannia Stadium is always going to be a testing game, not just for Man United, but for any team. 

'It's very important that the players know, some of the experienced players like Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick, what it takes, and a result here today [Thursday] will really send out a clear message that they're here to stay.'
