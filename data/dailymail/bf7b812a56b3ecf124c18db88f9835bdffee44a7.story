Arsenal's interest in Mario Balotelli looks to have been dealt a killer blow, after AC Milan CEO Adriano Galliani claimed the controversial striker would be staying with the Italian club.

The former Manchester City centre forward has been consistently linked with a move to Arsene Wenger's side, and Milan president Silvio Berlusconi was even quoted earlier this summer as saying: 'I was selling Balotelli to an English team for several millions.'

However, Galliani now appears to have shot down any chance of a move to England with the 23-year-old part of the club's plans for the new season.

'Balotelli has never asked to be sold,' Galliani said. 'There’s a 99.9% chance of him staying, but you never know what will happen.'

However, not all is lost for the Gunners: Milan's CEO has already made similar comments in May about Brazilian midfielder Kaka, saying: 'It’s certain we’ll keep him. I am 99.9% he’ll stay with us.'

Kaka subsequently moved to Orlando City, via a loan move to Sao Paulo.

But with Wenger now being quoted as saying he is happy with his options up front it appears a move for Balotelli is off for this summer at least.
