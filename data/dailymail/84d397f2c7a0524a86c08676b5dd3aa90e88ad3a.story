A Las Vegas substitute teacher has been accused of sexually assaulting a 15-year-old student after his father noticed a love bite on the boy's neck.

Tanikka Bella Queen, who was working as a long-term substitute at Hyde Park Middle School, faces charges of sexual assault against a child, sexual seduction and kidnap.

The 22-year-old, who taught geography, initially denied having a relationship with the teenager, but later told police she was in love with him.

When detectives searched cell phone records they found 2.400 messages, 108 phone calls and 38 images that had been shared between Queen and the student.Â 

Queen was arrested Tuesday, but the 
alleged inappropriate relationship began shortly after she started 
teaching at the student's school on February 2.

The student's father reported Queen after discovering messages from Queen about the relationship on a cell phone belonging to the boy's sister.

He also noticed a love bite on his son's neck.

According to police reports seen by the Las Vegas Review Journal, Queen and the boy would meet at a park, or arrange tutoring sessions at the lunch break.

The also went to McDonald's together and to the cinema to watch the romcom About Last Night.

On February 13, Queen is alleged to have created a code name for the student on her cell phone, and urged him to do the same.

On Valentine's Day a text said to be from the boy read: 'Your kisses take me to the clouds babe,' and a few days later the pair were declaring their love for each other, with the boy texting: 'Death is the only thing that's going to separate us.'

Toward the end of February Queen 
contacted the boy to say people were getting suspicious and that they 
needed to 'cool it down', before reassuring him: 'No matter how I act at school I still love you with all my heart.'

When
 she was arrested Queen denied having a relationship with the student, 
but she admitted kissing him and spending time with him.

The
 boy she is accused of having a relationship with told police he had 
spent time away from school with the substitute teacher but denied 
having sex.

When 
police spoke to another student at the school, she told them Queen had 
told her the pair did have sex and had been dating since Valentine's Day, Fox 5 Vegas reported.

A police report says Queen admitted having sex with the teenager while house-sitting for a friend.

Queen is being held without bail and will no longer be allowed to work as a teacher substitute in the school district.

Her charges include first-degree kidnapping, sexual assault against a child under 16, statutory sexual seduction and luring a child to engage in a sex act.

The kidnapping and luring a child charges are related to text messages that suggest the pair met at a park and at a McDonald's.
