The BBC was criticised yesterday for filling its prime-time schedule with repeats of programmes shown in the past week.

Amid more than six hours of reruns on BBC1 yesterday, shows such as Mrs Brown’s Boys, Not Going Out and John Bishop’s Christmas Show got prime-time billing just days after they first aired.

And anyone who switched to BBC2 in the hope of finding something fresh would have been equally disappointed. It was also filled with reruns, including last Sunday’s final of The Choir.

The Christmas special of Mrs Brown's Boys, watched by 9.4million people when it first aired on Christmas Day, was repeated at 10.20pm yesterday

The glut of repeats began on BBC1 at 1.50pm with Len Goodman’s Perfect Christmas, which was first aired on the same channel just 16 hours earlier.

The afternoon and early evening was filled with films and, after 30 minutes of EastEnders, viewers were once again treated to something from the archives – an episode of Miranda shown earlier this year.

A new programme was shown at 9pm – the second instalment of the murder mystery Death Comes to Pemberley – but the rest of the evening was given over to repeats.

The Christmas Day special of bawdy sitcom Mrs Brown’s Boys – watched by 9.4million people – was shown again at 10.20pm.

It was followed by another sitcom, Not Going Out, last seen on Christmas Eve, and John Bishop’s Christmas Show, which had been screened on Monday.

Almost half the BBC’s Christmas schedule was taken up by repeats – driven partly by spending cuts at the corporation. The number of reruns on BBC1 was up by ten per cent on last year

Tory MP John Whittingdale, who chairs the Commons culture media and sport committee, criticised the corporation for showing repeats in prime-time slots.

‘For many people this is still a holiday period, and lots of families are at home and want to watch something new,’ he said.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘This Christmas over 90 per cent of programmes in peak time on BBC1 are brand new and have lead the festive ratings on both days.

'Across the schedule, there are some carefully chosen favourites repeated for audiences to enjoy who missed them first time round.’
