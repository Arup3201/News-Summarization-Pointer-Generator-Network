The writer who posted the break up text she received from a new boyfriend has revealed that she thinks of herself as the one who initiated the break up.

Quin Woodward Pu is a blogger and author who writes about her social life in Washington, D.C. and her latest exploits caused an uproar when she decided to publicly shame the man who dumped her after only two dates.

After meeting a 'rando' at a bar on Friday the 13th (which she told MailOnline 'should have been a sign' of things to come), Ms Woodward Pu was outraged when he had the gall to send her a text ending their relationship just days before her 26th birthday. Now she has revealed that his text came after she was the one to initially cool things down with him.

While many commenters saw her scathing reaction in a series of texts that she sent to him following the break up as an overreaction, she has spoken out to clarify that she had initially been the one to 'pump the breaks' on the relationship.

Vindicated? Quin Woodward Pu has said that she feels that she initiated the break up by 'pumping the breaks' on the relationship before receiving the text

She told MailOnline that on their second date, which took place last Saturday night, he suggested that 'maybe we shouldn't be seeing other people'.

She said that she shrugged off the comment, saying 'Okay yeah let's talk about it later'.

'The rest of the weekend I went on another date, I was seeing other people. It was very casual,' she said.

Less than two days later, she received the infamous break up text, which she felt was written in a condescending way where he assumed he 'had the upper hand' in the relationship.

'I actually spent the entire day really mad... I was stewing and really agitated I'm already pretty high strung to begin with,' she said.

She crafted the admittedly 'hyperbolic' text and actually sent it to the editor who looks over her books and blog posts. The editor said that it was 'a little strong' and suggested she sleep on it before sending.

When Woodward Pu woke up on the morning of her birthday, she still felt the same sting from the text and decided to go ahead and send it. 

'I'm still mad. I still thought it was a d**k move- he thought that he had the upper hand and I'm none-the-wiser,' she said.

'Agitated': Woodward Pu said that the break up text made her mad because it assumed that he had the upper hand in their nascent relationship

She would not give any identifying details about the man when asked, except to say that he has a 9-year-old daughter and 'is not a young professional but is not middle aged'.

She also would not detail whether or not they have spoken since she published the texts, only saying that she is sure that he is still employed and his bosses do not know that he is the person she is referring to.

Firing shot: The unidentified man sent her this text after going on two dates and before another planned weekend

The self-published author said that 
she has not read the comments to her story online- a practice that she 
uses with all of her writing- but finds it funny that Reddit users 
created Amazon accounts purely to review her books because even though 
they have given scathing reviews, it helps her sales because her books 
move towards the top of the 'most reviewed' list and give it more 
publicity.

'I write my blog to entertain people, that's the only reason,' she said.

'I've taken great pains to protect his identity... I was not trying to ruin his life and I didn't ruin his life

The
timeline of events is the most controversial point that strikes a chord
with online commentators, as the break up text- and ensuing virtual 
firestorm- came after only two dates. Woodward Pu met the man, whose 
name she has not released, and they began exchanging emails before going
for a night of drinks, dinner and champagne.

After discovering that they had 
'relatively good chemistry', she invited him to her upcoming birthday 
party and when he could not make it, he invited her for a weekend-long 
trip to nearby wine country.

In an interview the day after she posted the break up text, Woodward Pu said that she had been the one to 'pump the breaks' on the relationship at that point.

She explained that the man had tried to have a conversation 'DTR', where they would Define The Relationship, and she thought it was too soon.

Quin Woodward's pompous self-aggrandized claims to be 'a 25 year old with two published books and a condo' has won her few fans and a host of negative comments

Quin Woodward Pu is the editor-in-chief of 
Little Black Blog, and has written two books about her fast-paced life 
in Washington, D.C. and her romantic exploits

‘The man had just 24 hours prior 
broached a DTR, which I politely shelved for the time being (that is not
in the original blog post because it seemed unnecessarily merciless to 
point that out, but I see now that it is an integral part of setting up 
my reaction), and who asked if he could spend an entire weekend with 
me,' she told In The Capital.

'For
him to suddenly "dump" me after I'd already politely pumped the brakes 
on our still-nascent "relationship"--that is what caused the anger, to 
try to preemptively end things before they'd even begun because he felt I
was pulling away.'

Said anger included threats to send his employers proof that he was using his work phone to ‘sext’ her.

'Though
unsolicited and completely unrequited, I thought the taxpayer-funded 
sexts from your agency blackberry were sweet, but your executive 
committee may think the screenshots of your messages I sent to them are a
little cheesy,' she wrote in the text to the would-be suitor.

On her Facebook profile late Thursday, she clarified that it was actually an empty threat.

'Let's all calm down, people. The boss was never informed. Government sexter is still very safely and soundly employed, with his superiors none the wiser,' she wrote.

Though she was stunned into self-proclaimed paralysis after receiving the break up text- where the unidentified man assured her that he had ‘no doubt you'll move on quickly as you are a funny, smart, cool girl’- the speed at which her story engaged the public did not come as a surprise.

Woodward Pu's two books - 'A+' and 'Digfast' are in fact self-published tomes of her own autobiography which have received a host of negatives reviews on Amazon

Quin Woodward Pu's two volumes of self-published memoirs have been labeled 'narcissistic' and 'pretentious'

‘There is a reason why my websites are kept up-to-date, and why I consulted a lawyer the night before I went live with the post. I knew exactly what I was getting myself into,’ she told In The Capital.

‘The reason this story has caught so much attention is because it is relatable, on both sides of the gender line.

‘To be fair, the man has both my books; he also knew what he was getting himself into.’

She also proudly states that sales for her books have dramatically increased since the story came out, in spite of the less-than-stellar reviews on Amazon: they both have an average review of 1.5 stars out of five.

Woodward Pu, who graduated from Vanderbilt University in 2009, wrote two memoirs about her ‘glitzy and glamorous’ pursuit of a ‘champagne-soaked’ career in journalism.
