Police first responded to Maurer's apartment on December 1 when the manager of his apartment complex alerted them to a 'strong odor of decay,' said Detective William Stanford.

MLive.com reports that the Washtenaw County Medical Examiner's Office estimated Maurer had been dead for more than a week and that Maurer's doctor signed his death certificate and noting that there was no sign of foul play.

Police could not locate Maurer's cell phone or wallet, but the apartment block manager told police she had seen nothing suspicious in the building.

She called police 10 days later, however, when she had reviewed the complex's security footage. She noticed Maurer enter the complex with three young men on the evening of October 23.

An hour and a half later, the three suspects are seen leaving the complex carrying 'what appears to be... some type of electronic notebook,' reports MLive.com.

Detectives reviewed Maurer's credit card activity and discovered account activity on November 24 and 25, including charges for hotel stays, food and gas.

Paling was identified in security footage as one of the three men entering Maurer's apartment complex. He already had an outstanding warrant for third-degree criminal sexual conduct.

They tracked Paling and Ranger down to a house in Wayne belonging to a church caretaker who told police he took in homeless people.

'He stated he met Rikky Ranger on a website called Grinder [sic] and had made friends with him,' Stanford said.

Once police had located the suspects, 'it was over rather quickly' Detective Lieutenant Robert Pfannes told MLive.com.

The pair told police they had met Maurer on Grindr and 'gone out a couple of times,' but that they 'had never had sexual relations.'

Together with Thompson, they decided to rob David Maurer and set up a meeting.

At Maurer's Ann Arbor apartment, they smoked marijuana and drank alcohol and Thompson told police Maurer, Ranger and Paling became 'sexually active' together.

At a certain point, they gave a signal to Thomson, who held Maurer in a headlock while the other two stole a .22 caliber revolver, a wallet, marijuana, cash and prescription drugs, two watches and a laptop.

According to MLive.com, Thompson kept Maurer in the headlock for as long as it took the others to steal his possessions - between five or 10 minutes.

Thompson stated that he was concerned he had killed Maurer because his body 'went limp' very soon after he grabbed him in the choke hold.

The three left the apartment, and Maurer was dropped face-down on his sofa, the same position in which his body was found more than a week later.

According to MLive, tears streamed down Thompson's face as he was arraigned.

The three were charged Sunday with murder, robbery, conspiracy to commit unarmed robbery, lacerny in a building and larcerny of a firearm and are being held in Washtenaw County Jail.

Their next court appearance is scheduled for December 26.

Police described Ranger and Paling as 'more transient than homeless,' and said Thompson lived with his father.

Shelley Ripley, Maurer's neighbor, was shocked by the manner of his death.

'He was a gentleman and a gentle man,' she told MLive.com.
