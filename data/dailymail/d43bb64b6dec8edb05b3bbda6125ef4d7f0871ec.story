Artworks owned by a woman once described as one of the most beautiful in the world are set to go under the hammer following her death.

Among Lady Marian Rootes' collection is a magnificent 18th century Rococo mirror and a George III Serpentine commode that might have been made by Chippendale himself.

A
still life painting by Sir Matthew Smith, sometimes called the ‘English
Fauvist’ because of his link with Matisse, is expected to fetch more 
than £30,000.

The collection, which numbers several hundred items, is expected to fetch a six figure sum at the auction at Duke’s saleroom in Dorchester, Dorset on  September 27.

Avid collector: Lady Marion Rootes, seen here age 65 on holiday, housed a collection of remarkable 
artworks that are now set to make a six figure sum when they go under the hammer later this month

Great beauty: Lady Rootes was regarded as one of the most beautiful women of her generation

Lady Rootes, who was in her 90s when she died, married into the family that founded car giant Rootes Motors, which supplied cars to Royalty.

Two generations of the magnificently wealthy family collected art to decorate their enormous properties in England and Scotland.

Rootes Motors was founded by William 'Billy' Rootes after WWI. Mr Rootes' son Geoffrey married Marian, who was a widow.

Lady
Rootes father-in-law provided cars to the rich and famous and made sure
his chauffeur and car was available to the Duke of Windsor upon his 
abdication.

It was the same vehicle, a Humber known as Old Faithful, that Field Marshall Montgomery used throughout the war.

He
also ensured that Sir Winston Churchill always had a succession of much
loved Humbers when there was a post-war shortage of motor cars.

In
1946 he bought the Glenalmond Estate in Scotland, a magnificent 
16,000-acre sporting estate with grouse moors, stalking, pheasant 
shooting, duck flighting lochs and game fishing.

At its heart stood a large house which he bought complete with contents, including silver and linen.

Lord
Rootes and his wife had it beautifully re-decorated by John Fowler and 
for 35 years it was the setting for many happy house-parties and 
excellent sporting holidays.

Rather special: A still life painting by Sir Matthew Smith, sometimes called the 'English Fauvist' because of his link with Matisse, is expected to fetch more than £30,000

Exquisite: A mahogany early George III chinoiserie wall mirror could fetch more than £50,000 at the auction in Dorchester, Dorset

The guest list was illustrious, with Harold Macmillan among the distinguished guns listed in the Game Book.

Lord
Rootes was honoured with an hereditary peerage in 1959 in recognition 
of his role in promoting Britain’s interests abroad as Chairman of the 
Dollar Exports Council.

He
took the title of Baron Rootes of Ramsbury, having bought Ramsbury 
Manor in Wiltshire a year earlier. The house was considered one of the 
most beautiful in the country.

When the Rootes' bought Ramsbury is came with many great paintings and the collection was added to by the family.

...And furniture too: A George III serpentine commode in the manner of Chippendale is expected to fetch more than £5,000

Grand: A Regency rosewood drum table, left, expected to fetch in excess of £15,000, is also in Lady Rootes' collection as is an 18th century Chinese mirror painting, right, expected to fetch in the region of £10,000

It is now owned by Harry Hyams, a 
reclusive millionaire, and in 2008 was burlged by the notorious Jonson 
gang - and was the biggest crime of its type in British history.

Both
the family’s homes were later sold and Lady Rootes moved to another 
property in Wiltshire along with her favourite art and furniture.

Guy
Schwinge, from the Dukes saleroom, said: 'Lady Rootes had an unerring 
eye for quality and had a collection full of glamorous objects whuich 
expressed her unique style.

Daddy Rootes: Lady Rootes' father-in-law Billy, was founder of Rootes Motors who supplied cars to the rich and famous

'The spectacular 18th century Rococo mirror from her drawing room is a masterpiece of English furniture.

'And her George III serpentine commode from Ramsbury Manor could be by Chippendale himelf.

'Lady Rootes was considered by many to be the most beautiful woman of her generation and objects from her home experss her glamour and give an insight into her gilded life.

'The Rootes' were one of the industrial dynasties of the 20th century and their rise was meteoric. They went from zero to peerage in a very short space of time.

'Billy Rootes was the Henry Ford of the UK.'
