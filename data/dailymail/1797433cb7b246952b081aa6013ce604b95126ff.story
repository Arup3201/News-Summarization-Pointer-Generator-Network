A father accused of starting a house fire that killed six of his children was overheard telling a friend 'it wasn't meant to end like this' on the night of the deadly blaze, a court heard today.

Mick Philpott, 56, made the remark at the hospital the siblings were rushed to following the devastating blaze at the house in Allenton, Derby, last year, a trial at Nottingham Crown Court was told.

Jurors also heard today how Philpott - who is accused of six charges of manslaughter along with his wife Mairead and family friend Paul Mosley - appeared to 'fake' a faint when he viewed his children's bodies in the mortuary at Royal Derby Hospital.

'Stoned': Mairead Philpott, seen with her husband at a press conference after the fatal fire, had been smoking cannabis on the night the deadly blaze broke out at the family home in Derby, a trial heard

The children died of smoke inhalation as a result of the fire in May last year.

Patient Louise Quantick said she heard 
Philpott make the comment to a man 
outside the hospital's accident and emergency unit around three hours 
after the family home went up in flames.

Ms Quantick said she had decided to leave the hospital because she became upset at the sight of trollies carrying the young Philpott siblings inside.

She described seeing Philpott standing outside the unit with a woman and another man when she went outside to wait for a taxi, adding that she heard the defendant say to the other man: 'It wasn't meant to end like this.'

Marie Smith, manager of the mortuary at Royal Derby Hospital, told the court today that Philpott appeared to faint when he came with wife Mairead to view the children for the first time after the fire at their house in Derby in May last year.

Ms Smith told jurors: 'It looked very unlikely to me that it was a genuine faint. Because of my experience working in that department, having seen many friends and relatives faint for whatever reason, it didn't appear to me to be genuine.'

She said Philpott, who was lying in 
the recovery position when she went into the viewing room, apparently 
woke up when she mentioned getting a doctor.

The manager of the hospital morgue told jurors she heard Philpott refer to his children as 'little s****' on at least two occasions, and witnessed him indulging in 'horseplay' with a police family liaison officer outside the morgue - grabbing him in a playful headlock as staff looked on during another visit.

Of his use of the phrase 'little s****', Ms Smith said: 'I think that was a term of endearment. It appeared that way.'

'His behaviour seemed to be irrational,' she added.

'It wasn't fitting with what had taken place with the children. He'd be quite angry one minute and then be apologising to everyone the next - it didn't appear to be genuine.'

She said during another visit it became 'a circus', with around a dozen people turning up at the mortuary.

Prosecutor Richard Latham QC asked her: 'What was happening with Mr Philpott and the family liaison officer?'

She replied: 'It appeared there was a lot of horseplay going on - not with the family liaison officer but with Mick. He grabbed the family liaison officer around the neck like in a headlock - there was a lot of horseplay.'

Ms Smith told the court that when she offered him some water, Philpott asked if some gin could be put in it.

'I've never in my experience had a relative make that request before,' she told the court.

Cross-examining the witness, Mairead Philpott's barrister Shaun Smith QC asked what her behaviour was like during the visits.

Ms Smith said: 'She didn't say a great deal and she spent a lot of time in silence or crying. She had her head down a lot.'

Tragedy: Floral tributes and teddy bears lay on the pavement outside the house in Allenton, Derby, after the fatal fire last May

Social worker Nicola Atterbury told the court that on a visit two weeks after the fire she 'had expected devastated parents', but 'neither was upset'.

During the meeting, Philpott demanded custody of the five children he had raised with his former mistress Ms Willis, the trial heard.

Ms Atterburyâ€™s colleague, Suzanne Eastwood, said he became 'angry, quite threatening' and started 'waving his finger' when told the children would be staying with Ms Willis.

Yesterday the court heard Philpott had visited a local drug dealer to buy cannabis that
evening, and his wife was 'stoned' hours before flames engulfed the 
house in Derby last May, friends of the couple said.

Prosecutors
say Philpott, 56, and his wife, 31, started the fire in an attempt to 
frame his former mistress Lisa Willis - who had lived with the couple in
their marital home and had four children by her married lover.

When Ms Willis walked out of the 
Derby home - taking her four children by Philpott and a fifth from a 
previous relationship with her - the pair became locked in a bitter 
custody battle. They had been due to attend a hearing at a family court 
on the day of the tragedy.

Nottingham Crown Court heard Philpott, 56, was 'paranoid' about the outcome of the case.

Friend
Adam Taylor, who lived yards from Philpott in Derby, said he had told 
him of his fears as the pair went to buy cannabis on the evening of May 
10 2012.

'He was paranoid at not winning,' Mr Taylor said at the trial yesterday.

'He was adamant that he did not want access, like weekends, he wanted full custody.'

Mr
Taylor's partner Vicky Ferguson told the court she had discussed the 
next day's court hearing with Mairead Philpott after the two men 
returned to the Philpott home in Allenton.

'She (Mairead) was stoned,' Ms Ferguson said.

'She said she'd had a smoke. I knew she smoked weed but she didn't smoke it very often.'

Ms Ferguson said 'everyone' knew Philpott preferred Ms Willis to his wife. 'Mairead did all the house work,' she said.

'She would make him toast, coffee, roll his roll-up.'

After Ms Willis left the cramped home with her five children, Philpott, Mairead, and the six youngsters they had together - Jade Philpott, 10, and her brothers Duwayne, 13, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five - were left behind.The young siblings all died of smoke inhalation as a result of the blaze, which broke out in the early hours of May 11.

Ms Ferguson told the court she visited the couple after the deaths of their children and was surprised by their 'normal' behaviour.'It was not the sort of behaviour you would expect from parents who had just lost six children,' she said.

She told jurors that Philpott later told friends he was planning to renew his wedding vows with Mairead.

'He said: "Listen to this, get your suits out, I am asking Mairead to renew our wedding vows",' she said.

Another neighbour, Darren Butler, told the court how he ran from his home to help after the blaze broke out, and spotted Philpott coughing nearby.'He was coughing but it was fake,' Mr Butler said.

'That was not a man coughing from smoke inhalation.'

Philpott, Mairead, and family friend Paul Mosley, 46, of Derby, all deny six counts of manslaughter.

The trial continues.
