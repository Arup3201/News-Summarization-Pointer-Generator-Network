A Texas lawyer has come forward claiming he is responsible for plastering stickers that read 'Exclusively For White People' onto business storefronts last week.

Adam Reposa, 40, a criminal defense attorney explained why he put up the stickers in a video posted on Thursday, titled Why I did it.

A shirtless Reposa is seen saying it would be obvious that even though people know the real problem, which is that 'people without money are getting pretty f***ed, they are getting pushed out and pretty quick this area of town is turning into whites only'.

These stickers appeared last week between Tuesday and Wednesday on the storefronts of at least six Austin, Texas businesses

While it appears Reposa is claiming gentrification as his defense, Austin NAACP president said the issues in the community run deeper and Reposa's actions add to the problems, according to KVUE.

Nelson Linder said: 'It's repugnant and also alarming, and also indicative of a mentality that doesn't understand race relations.

'So if you're trying to help race relations, you just did the worst thing you could possibly do.'

He said: 'Everyone is going to jump on "that's racist, that's racist", man this town and the way s*** works is racist

On Wednesday, a picture of the sticker on a local business surfaced on Facebook causing outrage after at least six businesses were left with the seals.

Each one read in its entirety: 'Exclusively For White People. Maximum of five colored customers. Colored BOH (back of the house) staff accepted. Sponsored by the City of Austin Contemporary Partition and Restoration Program.'

Reposa said he is not worried about offending people or stirring up racial tension.

'I've seen nothing but the emotional attachment that human beings place on events in history,' he said.

'It's regrettable and unfortunate and as soon as we can step beyond that precious of mawkish emotionality and just look at the real facts like human beings, is the moment that we have the chance for real progress.'

In the video, Reposa said that everyone attacked the stickers saying 'it's racist' but did not consider the 'condition of the way things are'.

He said: 'Everyone is going to jump on "that's racist, that's racist", man this town and the way s*** works is racist.

'But I knew I could bait all of y'all into being as stupid as you are and allowing the issue to be framed of the in the most simple way. "Oh he said an offensive term, let's not worry about the actually condition of the way things are, let's worry about an offensive term".

'And that's how they got it, they got it sewed up and they got this poor girl coming out here saying "it hurt my feelings", man who cares about your feelings man. Seriously? 

'Are y'all gonna get pulled around like that y'alls' entire lives, or y'all just gonna stop givin a f***? I don't give a f*** and look at me. 

'I use the technology every day to create possibilities. Apply the technology in your life and stop worrying about getting snitched on because it don't make a f*** what I did because I'm gonna do it again, I don't give a f***.'

The 'technology' that Reposa references in the video is linked to a Facebook page that reads: 'Taking human beings out of a false sense of belief and into the darkness by removing any meaning attached to any event in life.'

Reposa also wrote a sarcastic post on his personal page saying that he was not aware highlighting institutional racism was 'so repugnant'. It was reported that he said the full story would be revealed in a press conference on Friday

On the page he explains that the result of the 'The Technology' is that people 'who give a f*** passionately express their beliefs'. 

He also wrote a sarcastic post on his personal page saying that he was not aware highlighting institutional racism was 'so repugnant'.

He wrote: 'My f***ing bad y'all. I had no idea that pointing to institutional racism was so repugnant. Wait a second, am I giving a f***. F*** that. I ain't sorry. I ain't nothing but a particle floating through the darkness.'

He also wrote a sarcastic post on his personal Facebook page (above) saying that he was not aware highlighting institutional racism was 'so repugnant'

Last week, staff at an East Austin bakery were left horrified were wondering who would want to announce to their customers 'Maximum of 5 colored customers/colored BOH staff accepted.'

'As a multiracial family with a multiracial staff, there's nothing funny about this … It's sick,' Olivia Guerra O'Neal, owner of Sugar Mama's Bakeshop, told KXAN following the incident. 'We are disgusted by this act of vandalism and cowardice.'

The stickers also appeared during the night between Tuesday and Wednesday on a Mexican restaurant, clothing store, bicycle shop and others.

The stickers feature what looks like an official City of Austin seal and the message 'sponsored by the City of Austin Contemporary Partition and Restoration Program.'

However, Austin Mayor Steve Adler spoke out making it clear his city had absolutely nothing to do with the stickers.

The stickers said they were sponsored by Austin's 'Contemporary Partition and Restoration Program' along with an official-looking city seal, which led the mayor to condemn the confusing prank. Austin Mayor Steve (right) Adler spoke out making it clear his city had absolutely nothing to do with the stickers

'This is an appalling and offensive display of ignorance in our city. Austin condemns this type of hurtful behavior. Our city is a place where respect for all people is a part of our spirit and soul. We will keep it that way,' Adler said in a statement.

'Some jokes are not funny,' Texas House of Representatives member Dawnna Duke wrote in a Facebook post on Wednesday along with a photo of a sticker affixed to clothing store Rare Trends.

'If this is a joke at all, it is tasteless...I will be damned if this will occur in my House District … in this historical black community or any community.' 

Regardless of its intent, Sugar Mama's employees labeled it a hate crime.

'Today we were the victim of what I consider to be a hate crime against our family and staff at our Eastside location,' reads a post on the bakery's Instagram feed from last week. 'Our business was built on family and love and we will let that shine on.'

Reposa told the Huffington Post on Sunday that the full story  would be released in a press conference on Friday.

Austin police said they are aware of Reposa's YouTube video and are investigating, and he could possibly face vandalism charges.
