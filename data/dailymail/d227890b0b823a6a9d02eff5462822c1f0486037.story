The Duke of Cambridge pulled out of attending the British Military Tournament last night so he can spend time with his pregnant wife, who is recuperating after spending three nights in hospital.

The royal couple had both originally 
been due to attend the event but all of Kate's forthcoming public engagements were cancelled so she could receive treatment for severe morning sickness.

The cancellation was announced after Prince William joked the previous day that morning sickness should be renamed as Kate suffered it all day and night.

It now appears unlikely that the Duchess will attend the premiere of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey film in the West End on Wednesday, and may not make another public appearance for several weeks.

A St James's Palace spokesman said: 'The Duke of Cambridge will no 
longer attend the British Military Tournament at Earl's Court this 
evening, but will spend Sunday privately with the Duchess instead.

'It is well known that hyperemesis gravidarum often recurs and, until 
further notice, to allow the Duchess a degree of privacy during her 
pregnancy, we do not intend to offer regular condition checks or advise 
of routine developments associated with it.'

The cancellation of Prince William's attendance at the event, billed as 'the largest display of 
military theatre in the world', comes after he last night attended a charity event.

He went solo for the first 
time since the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge, also 30, was discharged 
from hospital.

He attended a
glittering charity tennis gala, the Winter Whites Gala, held in aid of 
homeless charity Centrepoint, at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

He was due to be accompanied by the Duchess, but she is resting after suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, an acute - and potentially dangerous - form of morning sickness.

The Duke, who is patron of Centrepoint, was congratulated by many on the news that a baby is on the way.

Former Centrepoint chairman Michael O'Higgins said: 'He said they shouldn't call it morning sickness as it's a day and all night sickness.

'All I've seen of him is his amazing ability to relate to people and I think the care he's shown for his wife this week says a lot.'

Prince William, looking smart in black tie, joined tennis greats John McEnroe, Bj√∂rn Borg and Boris Becker as well as celebrities including Sam Branson and Sadie Frost at the event.

The Royal Albert Hall was turned into a winter wonderland.

Inside, guests were greeted by actors dressed in costumes with a Dr Zhivago theme.

The Duke said it was a 'great pleasure' to be at the charity event as he later gave a speech.

He told guests that some of the most inspiring moments of his life had been with the young people of Centrepoint.

Referring to the night he spent on the streets in 2009 to experience what it is like sleeping rough, he said: 'Of course, this was just one night.

'I was cold but safe, and I knew I had a home waiting for me.

'Many others have no such luck. The cold streets are the only reality they know.

'And yet so often their spirit shines through.

'What these unfortunate men, women and young people could achieve given the right opportunities is limitless. I really believe that.'

He said that afterwards, he and 
Centrepoint chief executive Seyi Obakin had decided to set a goal to 
eradicate homelessness in the next 10 years.

He
added: 'We are now several years into that decade and the problem 
remains as acute as ever. Centrepoint hasn't given up on that ideal.

'These deserving young people haven't given up.'

Former British number one Tim Henman won a match against Croatian Goran Ivanisevic at the gala.

Kate's brother James Middleton also watched the game in a separate box from William.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge celebrated news of her pregnancy with a shepherd's pie and an early night, a former friend claimed today.

Ex-school friend Jessica Hay claimed the Royal couple discovered she was expecting at their small, three-bedroom cottage in Wales in October.

She described it in an interview with Australian magazine New Idea as 'the most nerve-racking moment of Kate's entire life'.

Jessica claimed the Royal couple wanted to make a public announcement about the pregnancy at Christmas, but their plan was blown when the Duchess was admitted to hospital with acute morning sickness.

She also claimed the pair do not want to know the sex of the baby.

The event ended with William presenting the Centrepoint Great Britain Youth Inspiration Award to Novak Djokovic.

The
world number one, who is a Unicef ambassador, was recognised for his 
humanitarian work to raise awareness of the importance of early 
childhood education in Serbia.

Tim
said: 'William seemed in good spirits. I just congratulated him on the 
impending birth and obviously said I hoped she was feeling better.'

The Duke laughed in disbelief as he spoke to some guests who had travelled all the way from the U.S. to attend the event.

Dr Natalie Monticciolo, from Tampa, Florida, was with other charity workers from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

She said: 'He joked 'which one of you has come the furthest? It was magical to meet him. He thanked us for coming. We congratulated him (on Kate's pregnancy) and he said thank you.'

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge delighted the world this week when they announced that Kate was pregnant.

The
couple were forced to announce the eagerly-awaited news after Kate was 
admitted to King Edward VII Hospital in London on Monday after she fell 
ill at her parents' house in Bucklebury, Berkshire.

She was put on a drip and spent three nights in hospital.

Kate returned to Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace and cancelled upcoming engagements to rest.

The Duchess of Cambridge's 
recuperation will no doubt be tinged by sadness after it emerged that 
nurse Jacintha Saldanha died in a suspected suicide.

Mrs Saldanha was found dead at King Edward VII hospital's staff lodgings.

Only three days before her death, the
46-year-old nurse had transferred a hoax call from two Australian DJs 
who obtained intimate details about the Duchess of Cambridge while she 
was staying at the hospital.
