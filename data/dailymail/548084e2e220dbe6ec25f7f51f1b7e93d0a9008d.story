Ordeal: Anthony Horowitz feared he would never be able to read or write again

He is one of Britain’s most prolific and successful novelists.

But Anthony Horowitz has revealed how he feared having to give up his lucrative writing career after a serious eye condition threatened to leave him blind.

The bestselling author was warned by one specialist that he would have to stop writing after developing cysts at the back of both of his eyes.

He admitted that he briefly considered stopping after his vision deteriorated, but concluded that ‘writing is my life’ and that ending his career early would be ‘ridiculous’.

He then met with several further specialists, who have said there ‘is nothing that can be done about it’.

The 58-year-old, who has penned more than 45 novels and 11 TV series during an illustrious 34-year writing career, told the Lady Magazine: ‘It’s been a very choppy year, health-wise.

‘My South African book tour got cancelled because of a disk in my neck. And now there’s a cyst on the back of my right eye – and a smaller one in my left eye, which is damaging my central vision.

‘Fortunately, they haven’t grown any bigger, but there is always the spectre of this getting worse and worse. I could even go blind in one eye.

‘It has been frightening. The first specialist I saw told me to stop writing.

'But I very quickly realised that writing is my life and to stop would be ridiculous.

'So I went and got second and third and fourth opinions, and they said actually it has nothing to do with reading and writing.

'Nothing can be done about it, though.

'Fortunately, I have two eyes.’

Horowitz has sold more than 16m copies of his books in the English language alone since his first novel in 1979.

Blockbuster success: Horowitz's books have been a hit in the cinema, like the Alex Rider series, Stormbreaker

Among his most popular are the Alex Rider children’s spy series, while he also wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel, House of Silk, which was released in 2011.

He has also written the scripts for ITV series Agatha Christie’s Poirot, Midsomer Murders and Foyles War.

However, Horowitz has also revealed that due to a series of other health scares in recent years, he now compiles a series of detailed notes about the books he is working on, and which he hands over to his assistant so they can finish the book in case he dies before he finishes.

He reveals he works 11 hour days and has just completed his latest Alex Rider novel, Russian Roulette, while working on his second Sherlock Holmes novel and his latest series of Foyle’s War.

He added: ‘People say that once you pass the age of 50, all you’re doing is dodging ailments. I don’t think I’m particularly old yet at 57, but these things happen and it just makes me work harder.

‘I do have a funny habit, though. I always leave notes for my assistant on how my books finish, so if I drop dead in the middle of one someone else can finish it.

‘The solution to my new Sherlock 
Holmes book is so pleasing that if I died, my last thought wouldn’t be 
about my wife and my children but: “Who’s going to finish this book?”

Horowitz
has also opened up about how he feel children and teenagers, who many 
of his books are aimed at, are being deprived of proper childhoods 
because they are ‘stuck indoors, with computer games’.

‘Our children are an unfortunate generation in many ways.

Critically acclaimed: The author has been a permanent feature in book shops since his first novel in 1979

'There are also all the health and safety issues. If a child falls over and bangs his or her knee, the immediate instinct is to contact the nearest lawyer and try and sue. At least they can still have adventures in books.

‘When my children were younger, we had a house in Suffolk, and they would run around having adventures and escapes and japes, while my wife, Jill, and I were reading the papers in bed.

'And we often used to think: “If anything bad were to happen, we would be on the front page of every paper, as negligent parents.”

‘But I don’t regret it. I think that it was great that my children had that wonderful opportunity to have adventures and use their imaginations. If society can’t sustain that anymore, what has it become?’
