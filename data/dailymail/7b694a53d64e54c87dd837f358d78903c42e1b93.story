A father has been charged with murder after allegedly stabbing his live-in girlfriend and their seven-year-old daughter to death in their home on Sunday.

Maciej Kotlinski, 35, faces two counts of first-degree murder for the killings of Ania Kosinska, 34, and Victoria Kotlinski in their Chicago, Illinois home. He also allegedly murdered their dog and cat.

The bodies of the mother and daughter showed signs that their killer had tried to decapitate them, police told the Chicago Tribune.

On Sunday morning, Kotlinski went to his parents' home in Waukegan with the couple's five-year-old daughter, who was unharmed, and allegedly told them that he had killed Ania and Victoria.

Killed: Ania Kosinska, left, has been found stabbed to death in her Chicago home beside the body of her daughter. Her live-in boyfriend and the father of the girl, Maciej Kotlinski, has been charged in the killings

He left the five-year-old girl and said he was going to kill himself.

Kotlinski's parents alerted police, who found Kotlinski nearby with a knife to his neck.

Authorities had to shoot the man twice with a Taser to get him to drop the knife and he was transported to a medical center for treatment of a self-inflicted neck wound. 

Chicago Police carried out a welfare check on the couple's home in the 3400 block of North Odell Avenue and found the woman and child stabbed to death, authorities said.

Victim: Victoria Kotlinski (right) was also found stabbed to death. Her father took her five-year-old, unharmed sister to his parents' house and left the girl with them before he fled to attempt to commit suicide

Volatile: Neighbors said they would often hear Kotlinski and Kosinska arguing at the house

Police also said that the 'family pets were unresponsive'. Authorities were also seen removing a large body bag from outside the home, believed to contain the pets.

An autopsy conducted on Monday determined that Kosinska and her daughter died of multiple stab and incised wounds, the Cook County medical examiner's office.

It’s not clear what exactly prompted the slayings but friends and neighbors said the couple, who were originally from Poland, often fought, the Tribune reported.

Friends told the paper that Kotlinski had a history of mental illness and a temper.

'[He] was not well,' one friend said. 'He'd been giving her trouble for a while.'

Scene: After telling his parents that he had harmed his family, authorities found the bodies inside the house, as well as the bodies of the family's cat and dog. Pictured, animal control removes the pets' bodies

No suspicions: Neighbors who lived close to the family's home, center, said they are shocked by the tragedy

Maggie Witucki, another neighbor, told the Chicago Sun-Times they would sometimes be forced to call police when the couple's fighting spilled outside into the street - but she did not know of it ever turning violent.

Police have launched a domestic-related murder investigation.

Victoria was a second-grader at St. Francis Borgia School. The school released a statement saying they were 'devastated by the sudden and senseless loss'. 

Kotlinksi is scheduled to appear in court on Tuesday on the charges, police said.
