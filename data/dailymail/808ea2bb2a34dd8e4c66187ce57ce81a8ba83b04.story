The parents of a teenage girl who suffered severe injuries after being dragged down a suburban street by a car say their daughter will have to learn to walk, talk and eat again.

Samantha Giufre, 18, remains in hospital fighting for her life after she was found in a gutter on Myall Road in Casula, south west of Sydney, on September 7.

Ms Giufre was rushed to Liverpool Hospital where she remains in intensive care after suffering multiple fractures to her skull and face, along with bleeding on her brain.

'We don't know whether she'll talk, whether she'll see. We don't know how she will end up, knowing that someone has taken that away from her. She's a good kid, she didn't deserve this,' her mother Karen said.

'The image of Samantha when we saw of her in the hospital… I just want to see her like she was originally. She doesn't look like that any more.' 

Doctors believe Samantha may have sustained permanent brain damage and may be blind in one eye following the incident.

Her father Frank said the family were celebrating Father's Day when Samantha decided to go meet up with friends at Casula.

Her cousin gave her a lift about 5pm and by 6.30pm the family were told Samantha was in the emergency department.

'It's devastating. She had traumatic injuries and god knows what else was happening in her head,' he said.

'We've been by her side 24 hours. I've given up work to be by her side.' 

The Giufre family say their daughter was a 'good girl' who had just finished a couple of courses through TAFE.

'She didn't have enemies,' Mr Giufre said. 

Her parents are pleading for anyone who witnessed the incident to come forward as police try to track down the driver. 

CCTV Footage of the incident shows a silver sedan driving down the street as Ms Giufre is dragged near the rear door of the vehicle.

Just seconds after two people  crossed the road with their dogs, the car entered a round about where the teenager is believed to have been found. 

Police have described the incident as a 'cowardly and callous act' and are not treating it as an abduction attempt.

'Samantha was leaning in the rear passenger window… (and) subsequently fell out of the vehicle,' Liverpool Crime Manager Dean Johnston said. 

'We're dealing with real victims here... This incident has left a young woman with serious injuries.

'Due to Samantha's injuries, investigators have been unable to talk to her. She will have to learn to walk, talk and eat again.'
