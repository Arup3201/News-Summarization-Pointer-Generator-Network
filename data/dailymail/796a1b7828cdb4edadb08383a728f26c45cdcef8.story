Police investigating the disappearance of Claudia Lawrence, 35, in 2009, today arrested a 46-year-old man from the York area on suspicion of perverting the course of justice

Detectives investigating the disappearance of Claudia Lawrence have arrested a 46-year-old man on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.

The man, who police say is from the York area, is currently being interviewed in custody while detectives conduct searches and forensic enquiries in relation to the investigation.

Meanwhile, detectives investigating the disappearance of the 35-year-old from York were searching a pub in the city that Ms Lawrence used to frequent.

Around eight police vehicles with officers, including scenes of crime and dog handlers, descended on the The Acomb pub in York early this morning and have been searching it since.

A spokesman for North Yorkshire Police confirmed that they were interviewing a 46-year-old man in connection with Ms Lawrence's disappearance, but would not comment on the pub search.

The force said the investigation was 'very much active' and said there was the possibility that further arrests will be made.

Police also said that the 59-year-old man arrested in May on suspicion of murdering Ms Lawrence remained on police bail while their enquiries continued.

Ms Lawrence, who lived in Heworth, York, was last seen by colleagues at the University of York on the afternoon of March 18, 2009 when she finished her shift.

She spoke to her parents, Peter and Joan, on the phone that evening but has not been seen since despite a huge police hunt.

Police issued a tweet saying: 'We are dealing with an ongoing incident at the Acomb Hotel, Kingsway West. Updates will follow when we can.'

Most police at the scene were from North Yorkshire Police but one van was from Durham Police, and officers with dogs and hammer equipment went in to work in the pub.

One local resident said: 'I was on my way to work at 8am and there was one police car here. When I came back a couple of hours later there were vans, dogs and police in CSI suits.'

Another local resident said police were 'swarming' around the area shortly after 8am.

Martin Hill, 54, said: 'I went to bed about 1am and there was nothing going on and when I woke up at 10am I opened my curtains and saw police cars and vans everywhere.

'I have lived here for 13 years and you get the occasional noisy night, but there's never been any major trouble in the pub. I have never seen this much activity outside the pub before so it was quite surprising.'

Sheila Overall, 54, a grandmother of four, said: 'We got up about 8am and the police were everywhere. I was up and down through the night, but I never heard anything.

'We get a lot of police around this area and there's usually something going off down the street, but I didn't expect this.

'When you see police about you think it must be serious.'
