A middle-aged woman had sex with a 15-year-old boy out of depression and loneliness not because she was a calculating predator, a judge has been told.

Kylie Fiona Henry's lawyer said her client's behaviour was not pre-meditated but had been an 'appalling lack of judgment'.

The 40-year-old mother of three children was acquitted in November of raping the boy at her Adelaide home in April 2011.

But the South Australian District Court jury found the former school canteen manager guilty of the less serious charge of unlawfully having sexual intercourse with him.

The teenager told an earlier sentence hearing that Henry 'robbed him' of his first sexual encounter and said the incident left him scared and confused.

'I felt ill, I can't trust women and I hate them,' he said.

At her trial, Henry denied having sex with the boy but said she did have a passionate dream about them having sex.

When she woke up she thought 'that was a good dream and then I realised who it was and then I thought that is disgusting, that is just wrong'.

On Wednesday, her lawyer Elizabeth Mansfield said Henry now admitted the offence, was embarrassed and ashamed, and seriously regretted the harm and hurt she had caused her victim.

She cited a psychologist who found Henry's actions were those of a long-term depressed and lonely woman, rather than those of a predatory, calculating woman.

Ms Mansfield urged the judge to suspend any jail term, saying the offending involved one isolated, brief incident and was at the lower end of seriousness for such matters.

But prosecutor Ian White said an immediate custodial sentence should be imposed.

He said the offending had a serious effect on the boy and noted the need to protect children from such behaviour.

Henry will be sentenced on June 6.
