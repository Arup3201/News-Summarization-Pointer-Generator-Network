The circus that is Blackpool was taken up a notch on Friday morning when two players were turned away from training after refusing to sign paltry new contracts.

Teenagers Henry Cameron and Mark Waddington both rejected professional contracts worth £200-a-week at Bloomfield Road.

Midfielder Cameron has now agreed terms on a two-year deal and is expected to be on the bench for the Saturday's Championship clash with Millwall.

But the players' initial rejection was met with a frosty reaction from the Seasiders, who told the pair to go home when they arrived at Squires Gate to train ahead of the Millwall match. 

Sportsmail understands chairman Karl Oyston – under investigation by the FA for labelling a fan a ‘retard’ - told them they will be sent back to the youth team unless they accept.

Blackpool still risk losing Waddington for a minimal amount when his youth contract runs out at the end of the season.

But, perhaps more gallingly for the club, striker Dom Telford has also opted against penning professional terms after being offered the same measly amount.

Telford, who scored an equaliser on his debut against Rotherham United on December 28, was made to train with the youth team on Friday.

A host of Premier League and Championship scouts are due to watch all three during the Under 18 fixture against Oldham on Saturday, given the trio are unlikely to feature for Lee Clark.
