Ronan Keating has confirmed that he has a new love in his life, Australian blonde Storm Uechtritz.

The pair have been close friends for almost two years, but recently their relationship has developed into something deeper.

The singer confirmed this week: ‘Storm and I have been friends for some time and that has recently evolved into something more serious. We are both really happy.’

New love: Ronan Keating and Storm Uechtritz have started a new relationship

Keating and the television producer became close when they met on the set of the Australian X Factor in June 2010.

Just one month earlier, news of 
Ronan’s affair with backing dancer Francine Cornell had broken, putting a
huge strain on the singer’s marriage.

And while his wife Yvonne spent that 
summer in Australia with the couple’s three children, Jack, 13, Missy, 
11, and Ali, seven, Ronan and Storm remained close friends.

A source on the show said: ‘Wherever Ronan went on the set, Storm went.

‘They hung out together all the time.

‘After the show, Ronan would go back and meet Yvonne and the children.

‘But on the set, Ronan and Storm just hung out and chatted and laughed. They were very close.’

In fact, the amount of time they spent
together during filming of the first series sparked speculation as to 
the nature of their relationship.

Then in November, Storm suddenly left 
the show to join the production team at Masterchef Australia. She worked
on that programme for 10 months and last October she was hired as a 
producer on The Voice of Australia, a rival show to Ronan’s X Factor.

‘Ronan was definitely sad to see her go,’ added the source.

‘But they kept in touch, with Storm sending him notes on his performance and just meeting for coffee.’

When the X Factor wrapped in January 2011 and Ronan returned to Ireland, the pair kept in contact.

At the time, Ronan and Yvonne were still trying to save their marriage for the sake of the children.

But sources believe that as early as 
March 2011 the couple were struggling to put the Cornell affair behind 
them.At the same time, Ronan and Storm were constantly in touch through 
phone calls, texts and emails.

And that March she made the trip from Sydney to London to party with Ronan for his birthday.

However, when Ronan realised that 
Yvonne was also attending the London party, Storm decided not  to attend
the bash, opting instead to meet Ronan the day after he had celebrated 
on March 3.

‘It was just decided that Yvonne was 
making the effort to be there for Ronan and it wouldn’t be fair to have 
Storm there as well,’ said a band source.

‘The rest of Boyzone was there as well
and it just made sense not to have an Australian blonde girl sitting 
with him when Yvonne walked in. As far as I know, Yvonne was not aware 
of Ronan’s friendship with Storm.’

By June 2011, it became clear that the
differences between Ronan and Yvonne were irreconcilable and the couple
began to accept that their marriage was over for good.

By February 2012, Yvonne had finally put the affair behind her and had begun to date cameraman John Conroy.

A friend of Ronan’s new partner said: 
‘They have loads in common – both are into keeping fit, music, good food
and wine – and there is a real spark between them. For the first time 
in months, Ronan has a real spring in his step and although they’re 
still in the early stages, both think this could be something long 
term.’

A friend of Storm’s added: ‘Those 
close to Storm have known for some time about her and Ronan, and 
everyone’s delighted for her.’

The ex-Boyzone star announced the 
separation from his wife of 14 years just five months ago. Yvonne is 
said to have been irreparably heartbroken by the revelations that her 
husband had cheated.

News of Ronan’s affair with backing 
dancer Francine Cornell emerged two years ago when his wife found 
incriminating text messages on a secret mobile phone.

The couple attempted to work through their problems but finally announced their divorce in April.

Ironically, it has emerged that Storm,
who married Sydney financial director Tim Ivers in a beachside ceremony
in August 2009, shared her first dance with Ivers to Keating’s hit 
song, You Say It Best. Friends said Ivers was ‘a lovely guy’ whose 
separation had come as a huge shock.
