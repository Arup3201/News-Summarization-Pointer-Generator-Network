A week after a Chicago-area woman claimed that she was forcibly stripped by LaSalle County deputies, more women have allegedly come forward with similar complaints.

Dana Holmes, 33, was arrested in May for drunk driving and is now suing county police for what she says was an illegal, humiliating strip search by four officers that was all caught on video.

Holmes' lawyer Terry Ekl said: 'We have reason to believe there are other women who have been illegally strip-searched by the sheriff's office', the Chicago Tribune reported.

Footage: Surveillance video shows an intoxicated Dana Holmes, 33, being strip searched by four police officers

Arrested: Holmes was also taped as she was arrested May 18 for driving at nearly three times the legal limit

Pictured: Dana Holmes was nearly three times the legal drinking limit when she was pulled over in May and was strip searched by four officers

Ekl has asked a judge to force LaSalle County authorities to store all video recordings from inside the jail for evidence and filed an emergency motion for a protective order for such proceedings.

Ekl's motion 
said: 'It is believed that the video recordings will be destroyed, 
either routinely or otherwise, if they are not ordered preserved.'

A LaSalle County spokesperson would not comment on the case.

Dana
Holmes was nearly three times over the legal blood alcohol limit when 
she was pulled over and taken to county jail on May 18, where 
surveillance footage shows her being pulled to the ground by a female 
officer and three male officers.

The
33-year-old was stripped completely of her clothes and left naked in a 
cell alone, where she cried on the floor for several minutes before 
police tossed her a ‘padded suit.’

Holmes was transported to the county 
jail by local authorities who made no note of any combativeness. Footage
of her DUI arrest released to the media shows her cooperating and the 
local authorities made no note of her resisting behavior.

However, Lasalle County police say local cops informed them she was ‘being mouthy and causing problems’ according to the Chicago Tribune.

It
is at the county jail where things take a turn. Holmes is shown being 
searched against a wall by a female officer as male officers watch.

Problems: Local police made no note of her resistance. But when she was transported to the county jail, police say Holmes was 'mouthy and causing problems'

Resisting? Police say footage shows Holmes kicking them. Holmes denies it. While that remains unclear, laws covering strip searches are explicit

At one point, one of her legs moves. Lasalle police say the footage, which has no audio, shows Holmes kicking them.

Holmes
is then taken to the ground by officers and footage shows her being 
stripped of her clothes by four officers and tossed into a cell.

‘I did not kick,’ Holmes said. ‘I don't know if I lost my balance or what happened, but I wasn't being combative at all.’

While it’s unclear what led police to strip Holmes, laws regarding strip searches are clear.

‘Nothing in the statute says 
resisting arrest is justification for a strip-search,’ attorney Len 
Cavise of DePaul University College of Law told the Tribune.

The lawyer representing the Coal City woman agrees.

‘It's not only a violation of her civil rights. It's also a crime,’ said Terry Ekl.

Under Illinois law, a suspect may 
only be stripped by an officer of their same sex and never in the 
presence of anyone not participating in the search.

Stripped: Footage shows Holmes being taken to the ground and pulled into a cell, then stripped by three male officers and a female officer

Legal? Under Illinois law, only an officer of the same sex may strip search a suspect and only those participating in the search may observe it

After she is naked in the cell for what she says is several minutes, a male officer throws Holmes a 'padded suit'

Holmes
was put in a cell while still nude, where she says she cried on the 
floor for two or more minutes before a male officer tossed her something
to cover up with. According to the police report, Holmes was told she 
would stay there ‘until she sobers up and was willing to cooperate and 
not fight with deputies," according to the report.’

‘I was terrified. I felt helpless. I was scared and I lay there crying,’Holmes told WLS. ‘I just prayed.’

Holmes is suing the LaSalle County sheriff's department and the four deputies for violating her civil rights after her May 18 arrest and for inflicting emotional harm by stripping her without legal justification and says she hopes the officers involved lose their jobs.

‘There's a lot of people that get DUIs, a
lot of people that just make mistakes in life,’ Holmes said. ‘That 
still doesn't give them a reason to do what they did. My dignity is 
worth more than that, and other people's too.'
