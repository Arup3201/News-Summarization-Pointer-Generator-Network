A Second World War veteran who survived after both his ship and the rescue vessel that saved him were sunk by the Germans has died aged 97.

George Dexter, of Hodge Hill, Birmingham, was the last living survivor of a Luftwaffe raid on evacuation ships SS Slamat and HS Diamond - an attack that claimed 843 lives.

HMS Wryneck, the small boat that plucked him from the churning water, was also destroyed.

Days gone by: Mr Dexter (left) with two comrades. He survived after both his ship and the rescue vessel that saved him were sunk by the Germans

Fighting abroad: Mr Dexter in Iraq in the 1940s. He also served in countries such as Egypt, Libya and Syria

His story has similarities to that of 
the fictional Only Fools and Horses character Uncle Albert, who is 
famously said to have been sunk seven times in four years during the 
Second World War.

The 
character - played by the late Buster Merryfield, who also served in the
 war - spends much of his time in the classic BBC comedy with Del Boy 
and Rodney recounting his tales from the war.

Mr Dexter was one of only eight men rescued after SS Slamat and HS Diamond sank in the Greek Mediterranean on April 27, 1941.

He
 was serving with the 308 Company of the Royal Army Service Corps when 
placed on the ill-fated SS Slamat. Only last November, Mr Dexter told 
his incredible story to a local newspaper.

He said: ‘It was a scene of total 
carnage and devastation. The deck of the ship and the surrounding water 
was covered in debris. I managed to find a rope and abseiled down the 
ship where I dived into the water.

George Dexter

‘I
 don't know if it was bomb shock or just his sense of humour, but in the
 middle of all this death and destruction a sailor was clinging to the 
top of a floating barrel merrily singing "Roll out the Barrel"… It was 
quite a surreal moment.’

For
 Mr Dexter, the same thing happened again that night. HMS Wryneck 
was hit shortly after the bedraggled soldier was dragged on board.

He
 added: ‘I opened my eyes and saw utter carnage. There were bodies 
everywhere. I realised I was the only guy in the mess moving.

Saved: After being plucked from the water by HMS Wryneck, Mr Dexter managed to scramble into a rescue boat and was eventually picked-up by HMS Orion (pictured) and taken to Crete

Also involved: HMS Griffin (pictured) which picked up the remaining survivors off evacuation ship SS Slamat

‘The ship started to list heavily to one side and started to sink. I knew I had to get out as quickly as possible.’

George Dexter

Mr Dexter managed to scramble into a rescue boat and was eventually picked-up by HMS Orion and taken to Crete. He went on to serve in Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Palestine and Syria. Back home, he was a mechanic.

Mr Dexter died on Sunday at John Taylor Hospice in Erdington, Birmingham, after a long battle with cancer. His wife Audrey died 14 years ago and the couple had no children.

Ann Barrett, a relative of Mr Dexter who lives in Scotland, said: ‘We are trying to find out what funeral George wanted.

‘We think it would be military because the highlight of his life was his time in the army. If so, we'd like the British Legion to be there with standard bearers.’
