From showers that leak through walls to taps running brown water, it's just another day for renters with lazy landlords and real estate agents.

After months of negotiating, numerous phone calls and emails, frustrated tenants have taken to social media to share their rental horror stories, with the hashtag #rentalproblems.

Taking gardening to a whole new level, one woman found a batch of spring onions growing in her roof gutter, while another found all of her things eaten by termites.

Almost half of all Australian renters are seemingly unaware of their rights when it comes to bonds, rent increases and repairs, new survey has found. 

Simply doing the dishes and taking a shower turned into a nightmare for one tenant with brown water pouring out of her taps

Another day inside a renters home... This was a dining room before (a party) the ceiling caved in 

A CHOICE survey has found that 45 percent of tenants are finding it difficult to get by.

CHOICE spokesman Tom Godfrey told Daily Mail Australia that it’s important for tenants to know their rights to avoid being treated unfairly or exploited when it comes to renting.

‘We’ve all heard rental horror stories of tenants being slapped with unexplained rent increases and struggling to get repairs completed,' he said.

‘Tenants need to know where they stand under the law because it’s a powerful position to be in and gives you confidence when you’re negotiating with the real estate or landlord.

‘It’s concerning that nearly half of Australians are finding it difficult but consumers can save a lot of money and time if they know a way around it. '

CHOICE have navigated the tricks and traps of renting and identified five points to ensure consumers get the most out of their tenancy.

'The five tips we've put together were the biggest concerns that we often get asked about,' Mr Godfrey said.

Whoops! This is what happens when one tenant went to take a relaxing bath and found her hot handle missing

The survey found one of the biggest problems people were faced with is getting repairs or maintenance requests completed.

'Landlords and real estate agents are obligated to act quickly when it comes to repairs to ensure they're not putting tenants at risk,' Mr Godfrey said.

'It's their job to keep the property in a reasonable condition but if they're not taking care of it, you can take it to the tenancy tribunal.

‘Some tenants are afraid that they would get evicted if they raise their concerns.

'But don’t be nervous to ask for repairs and the best thing to do is always ask questions and negotiate with your landlord or real estate agent.

‘Push through those nerves because staying safe is your number one priority and there should be no reason why repairs should be delayed.'

Another problem tenants were slapped with are unexplained rental increases.

'Tenants should be aware that rent has come down over the past few months so if you’re being slapped with rent increases, it’s definitely well worth looking into it,' Mr Godfrey said.

Nguyet Tram, 21, from Sydney, told Daily Mail Australia that she started getting problems around her rental home just one week after moving in.

‘We moved into the home back in February and a week later, we noticed our ceiling in the dining and kitchen rooms were bubbling up and we could see water leaking through,’ she said.

While this woman had to move her room outside because the air conditioner was broken

Nguyet Tram said her ceiling started bubbling up and the paint was peeling off from the water damage of the bathrooms up stairs in February and the landlord still hasn't repaired the damages

Ms Tram's shower was leaking from upstairs and has caused the ceiling to change colour and moulds have grown from the water damage but her landlord still hasn't done anything for eight months since it started

‘We realised it was coming from both our showers up stairs so we called the landlord and he didn’t come around until two weeks later.

‘By the time he came around, the ceiling had turned yellow, the paint was crumbling and falling off and mould started growing out of it from the water damage.

‘They eventually fixed the showers but till today, we’re still living under the damage mouldy ceilings.

‘Another problem we have, which still hasn’t been resolved is the broken shower door in one of our bathrooms. We also didn’t have TV reception for six months.

'We've called, emailed, sent text messages but it never got anywhere so we ended up calling and paying for a cable guy ourselves.’

The frame on the shower door of Ms Tram's home still hasn't been repaired since May when she put in a request to her landlord and real estate agent

Ms Tram is not the only one who has faced with difficulty problems with her landlord and real estate. 

Jodie Rock from Newcastle, posted on CHOICE's Facebook page that the home she's currently renting has problems in every corner.

'It has live electrical cables hanging out of the walls, in-ground pool had barely any fencing, oven and grill don't work, big gas leak in cupboard because it's connected to the oven,' she wrote.

'There had been a fire in the laundry and lounge room due to ants nesting so badly in the light switches, toilet in en-suite leaking sewerage so they took it out and left the open sewer pipe and no toilet there (so it smells really really bad).

'They haven't paid the water bill so the water is always being disconnected and we have to put it back on ourselves. We've been electrocuted in the shower due to the earth being in a bad location.

'When it rains, it will rain in two of the rooms, only have a key to the front door, some door won't lock at all. When we tried to move in, we had to have a cleaner come in and it took them over a week to make inside liveable due to its filthy condition.'

CHOICE reveals the top five tips to ensure consumers get the most out of their tenancy

1. Rental increases

Your rent cannot be increased during a fixed-term tenancy agreement (less than two years), unless it is written into your contract. For a periodic lease, in most states and territories your rent can only be increased every six to 12 months. Plus, in most states and territories you’re entitled to a notice period of 60 days.

Landlords are also not allowed to increase your rent by an excessive amount. While there is no set amount that is regarded as excessive, if you believe the rent increase is too large, you can dispute it through your state’s appropriate service.

2. Fee-free rent payments 

Renters are often charged fees through third-party rent collection companies. In South Australia, New South Wales and Queensland, you’re entitled to at least one fee-free way to pay rent.

3. Right to repairs 

Landlords are required to conduct repairs to keep the property in a reasonable condition. If your landlord does not take care of a repair or maintenance request, you may be able to apply to a tenancy tribunal to have your rent paid into a special account until the repairs are completed.

4. Right not to be on tenancy databases 

You can only be put on the tenancy database for two reasons: if your rent is overdue by an amount larger than the bond, or if you’ve breached your tenancy agreement.

Your agent or landlord is required to inform you if they plan on listing you, giving you time to consider and dispute the claims.

5. Right to get your bond back 

Unless your landlord can make a legitimate complaint to the bond board, you have the right to get your bond back as soon as your tenancy is over.
