Ask Claire Croft how many children she has and she'll say: 'Three.' In fact her youngest, Jake, tragically died just a few months ago. But as Claire explains: 'I'll always have three children. And I am still Jake's mother.'

Her darling boy was just four-and-a-half when he passed away last October. The speed with which he became ill left Claire, 29, husband Stuart and their two older children reeling.

Jake had loved playing football and rough and tumble with Jack, 12, and Alex, seven. 'One moment he was running around with his brothers,' recalls Claire, a stay-at-home mum from Barnsley, South Yorkshire. 'The next, I was organising his funeral. It happened so fast, I still don't think I have come to terms with it.'

Jake was just about to start his reception year at school when he started complaining of 'achy legs' in August last year. 'I just thought it must be growing pains - I'd heard lots of mums say their children's legs ached sometimes,' says Claire.

'Some days he had no pain at all, others he would complain that it hurt a lot, sometimes in the lower part. As the term progressed, I thought, maybe he just wasn't keen to go to school.'

In fact, the medical consensus is that growing limbs do not normally cause pain. As Dr Kate Wheeler, a consultant in paediatric oncology at Oxford Children's Hospital says categorically: 'Growing pains do not exist.'

Some children between the ages of three and 12 may suffer from pains in the legs at night, adds Dr Martin English, a consultant paediatric oncologist at Birmingham Children's Hospital.

'But there is no evidence this is due to growth itself and in some cases may just be the aches and pains after physical activity that anyone would have. It may be that some children are more aware of pains than others.'

Sometimes GPs may use the term 'growing pains' if they're unsure of the cause of child's pain, but 'if a problem persists or is getting worse, the cause should be reconsidered,' says Dr English, who is a spokesman for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. For instance, 'growing pains' may be a sign of an underlying condition such as childhood arthritis.

Pain around the upper part of the shin (tibia) in rapidly growing, active children may also be linked to Osgood-Schlatters disease, a painful condition that causes inflammation of the tendon that attaches the knee cap to the shin - this is not serious and usually clears up over time.

Dr Wheeler warns that if a child has pains in the legs and other symptoms such as persistent limping, pain or bruising, parents should not assume it is just 'growing pains' - 'they should always get their child seen by a doctor'.

As Claire is now all too keenly aware, in rare cases 'growing pains' can be a sign of something serious.

A month after Jake started complaining of achy legs he lost his appetite and developed bruises on his shins that varied in size from that of a 5p coin to a 50p piece.

'I thought perhaps he was being kicked at school, so I went to his teacher,' says Claire. 'But she said nothing like that was happening and Jake was happy at school.' By now it was October, six weeks after he had first complained of achy legs and Claire decided to take him to the GP.

He examined Jake and ordered blood and urine tests at the hospital. The next day the hospital called to ask Claire and Stuart to bring Jake in straight away as his white blood cell count was unusually high. 'My stomach lurched,' says Claire. 'I was terrified.'

That afternoon Claire and Stuart, 38, hurried back to hospital with Jake. Doctors told them the heartbreaking news that Jake might have leukaemia. He was immediately transferred to Sheffield Children's Hospital for scans. Afterwards, Claire and Stuart were led to a quiet room.

'I saw the consultant's face and I knew then there was something much worse going on,' Claire says. 'Before, when we'd talked of leukaemia, although it was terrifying, everyone seemed so hopeful and mentioned that the success rate if treated early was high, but now the tone changed.

'I remember hearing her speak and then watching as Stuart just collapsed into his seat.'

The consultant said Jake had an aggressive children's cancer called neuroblastoma. There was only a 30 per cent chance of survival. Jake was at stage four - an advanced stage - of the disease.

Neuroblastoma is a cancer of specialised nerve cells called neural crest cells that are particularly concentrated in the adrenal glands above the kidney and on either side of the vertebrae in the spine. Jake's tumour had begun on his right kidney.

Claire says: 'We were told the doctors would still fight it with chemotherapy, but the odds were stacked against us. I was reeling. I hadn't even taken it in. How had "growing pains" in my healthy boy been hiding this?'

There are about 100 cases of neuroblastoma diagnosed a year in Britain. 'It's very much a children's disease,' says Dr Wheeler. 'Ninety per cent of patients are under five years old, but very occasionally it can develop in an older child, a teenager or an adult.'

The symptoms can vary from child to child, but early warning signs of the disease include a protruding abdomen, unexplained weight loss and limping or pain in one or both legs. Even now, Claire constantly casts her mind back - trying to remember signs she may have overlooked. 'But just days earlier Jake had been playing his computer games or running after his brothers.'

After his diagnosis Jake remained in hospital. Two weeks after he was admitted, he was sedated for an MIBG scan - a nuclear scan which involves an injection of radioactive liquid - which looks for abnormal cell growth in the body.

Jake never regained consciousness. 'A consultant took me aside,' says Claire. 'I only had to look at his face to know. He confirmed Jake's organs were failing.'

The scans showed his liver was riddled with tumours and in the hours that followed Jake's heart stopped twice. Oncologists tried Jake with his first round of chemotherapy - desperate to try anything even at this stage. But it didn't work.

'They brought him back each time his heart stopped, but then a doctor told me this would simply keep on happening. I knew what he was saying. Jake's poor little body had been through so much. We had to make the hardest decision of our lives.'

He had been put onto life support, but even this wasn't working. Claire and Stuart decided to let him go. Later that day, Jake passed away in his mother's arms. It was only 14 days after he'd first seen the GP.

'I walked around in a numb haze, unable to accept it,' says Claire. 'I went through every stage of grief - disbelief, anger and back to disbelief again.'

The family banned anyone from wearing black to the funeral and, instead of having flowers, they released balloons into the sky.

Now, although still in the depths of her grief, Claire wants to raise awareness of the signs of children's cancer among other parents.

'The trouble with the symptoms, is that so many of them can be explained away,' she says. 'The aching legs I thought were growing pains, the bruised shins could have been from rough and tumble. I had no idea these symptoms meant he had the most aggressive form of cancer. I look back every day at pictures and ask myself: did he have it then? I'll never know.'

In the months after her son's death, she found some comfort after visiting Jake's oncologist.

'The consultant told me Jake's was the most aggressive form of neuroblastoma she'd seen in her career and that he'd probably only had it for around two months.

'She said even if we had started chemotherapy earlier it may have had the same result.'

Since Jake died Claire says it is only thanks to her other children and Stuart she's been able to cope. 'It's because of them I am still here,' she says. 'I don't think I could have carried on otherwise.'

All she can do is hope no other parent has to endure the same heartache. 'If my story can help another mother spot the signs in her child, then that's something I can be proud of in Jake's memory,' she says.
