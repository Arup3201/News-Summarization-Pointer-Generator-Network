It’s a traditional British dish which is popular with tourists.

And now fish and chips fans can get their fix in a new guise – ice cream.

A seaside shop is selling the unusually flavoured frozen dessert, using bits of real battered cod, deep-fried potatoes and mushy peas.

New twist: The frozen desert, on sale in North Yorkshire, is served with a chip as a flake

Teare Wood's Ice Cream Parlour, in Whitby, North Yorkshire, has combined the traditional holiday tastes to tempt tourists. 

Shayne Wood, joint owner of the Pier Road venue, created the new range of chip shop-inspired ice cream.

Using fresh ingredients from Russell's takeaway next door, Shayne created Whitby's newest local delicacy.

To complete the look, Shayne rolls the fish ice cream in batter and topped the whole lot off with a chip in the place of a flake.

‘The guys at the chippy thought I was mad,’ Shayne said. ‘But it was really easy.

‘And it's actually quite nice - kind of like a savoury fish cake but a bit more sweet.’

The three different flavours were made by breaking up the original ingredients and blending them with the usual ice cream mix, then whipping it up and freezing it.

The task was made all the more difficult as last week one of the Jersey cows which supplies milk to the ice cream parlour was killed after being struck by lightning in a storm.

It isn't the first time the parlour - which has been open for four years - has experimented with unusual flavours, having previously produced corned beef, coconut korma and roasted garlic flavoured ice cream.

‘Garlic was horrible, really bad,’ said Shayne. ‘But it turns out you can make pretty much anything into ice cream. There's no way we're going to serve this to the public though.’
