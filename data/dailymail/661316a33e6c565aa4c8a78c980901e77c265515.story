It is nearly half a century since he won an Olympic gold medal.

But hurdler David Hemery, 70, is still fit – and determined – enough to take on the London Marathon.

The former athlete insists he will finish the 26-mile race across the capital next month, even ‘if I have to crawl’.

David Hemery, 70, will run the London Marathon, 47 years after winning an Olympic gold medal

He aims to cross the line in five-and-a-half hours, alternating between one-minute walks and 30-second runs.

After a record-breaking win in the 400-metre hurdles in Mexico City in 1968 the Olympian from Wiltshire won silver and bronze in the 1972 Munich games, and Commonwealth gold in 1966 and 1970.  

Dr Hemery, who was made a CBE in 1969 and is vice-chairman of the British Olympic Association, plans to run with his 30-year-old son Pete and friend Ray Ridley, 55.

He said: ‘The training has gone quite well but I’ve suffered with some stiffness in my calves. I’m walking long distances. Part of it is just getting used to being on your feet for a long time. But even if I have to start on crutches – if I have to crawl – I will finish.

‘Some think I’m crazy and others think it’s really inspiring that a sprinter would take on a marathon.’

Dr Hemery is running for 21st Century Legacy, a charity that trains young people in life skills. To sponsor him visit www.virginmoneygiving.com/DavidHemery
