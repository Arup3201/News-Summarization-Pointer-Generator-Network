Dina Asher-Smith, the newly crowned world 100 metres junior champion, will find out her A-Level results before she runs in the 200m heats at the European Championships in Zurich on Thursday. 

The 18-year-old is hoping for the three 'A' grades in English, history and biology she needs to read history at King's College, London.

She 'finds Mussolini really interesting' and is fascinated by the way our perspectives on key historical events have changed over time. Asher-Smith's giggly admission she is 'quite hard to please and always sets her targets high' quickly appears something of an understatement.

Balancing her two passions, though, has so far proved productive, as her grades and growing medal collection, which already includes world senior 4x100m bronze, world junior 100m and European junior 200m gold, have shown. Asher-Smith also happens to be the quickest British woman over 100m so far this season.

She said: 'I know that I’ve got to zone out from my school and university world if I’m on a race track because it’s not going to help me. Knowing dates and history stuff isn’t going to help me run faster down the track.

'I don’t want to let my academic performance slip and I know for a fact that I’m not going to let my athletics performance slip either. So I’ll have to find a way to make the two work out. The two have to be at quite a high level for me to be happy.

'I like modern history and I find Mussolini really interesting. I might sound really boring but I find historiography so fascinating. Something like Hitler and the Nazis, the facts of it haven’t changed but as we have gone on in time we have a different perspective on it.'

Just two years ago, Asher-Smith stood behind the start line of the men's Olympic 10,000m final on 'Super Saturday'; one of 10 club runners from Blackheath and Bromley chosen to carry the boxes of athletes' clothing after the race. 

She was not allocated Mo Farah's kit, but says it was still 'one of those moments you are never going to forget', even if she's not about to get ahead of herself by thinking of her own Olympic potential in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and beyond.

The transition from junior to senior can be a difficult one, but Asher-Smith appears to be taking it all in her stride. She has not been picked to run in the 4x100m relay in Zurich, saying she would feel 'mean' taking the place of one of the athletes who won Commonwealth bronze earlier this month, yet she is clearly not daunted by the prospect of the 200m, her first senior individual event.

'I just think that we are just not scared,' she says. 'I know that might sound really silly but some juniors come up and they put the seniors on a pedestal. They're maybe a bit wide-eyed. I really look up to them, but there is a difference between idolising and respecting them.

'Sometimes I think the juniors can go into their first major event and they idolise too many of these people. You have to have respect for your competitors but you have to realise that, when you are on the line with them, you are going to race.

'You will run the same distance as them. You have to get to the end very quickly and hopefully quicker than them. You have to normalise them a bit and don’t tense up or start panicking. When that does happen, you shut down and you come last.'

That changes of that happening to Asher-Smith, you imagine, are very slim indeed.
