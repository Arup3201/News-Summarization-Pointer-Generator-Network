Max MacAskill claims he spent a month in jail for a crime he did not commit because he has ginger hair

A Scottish man has claimed he spent a month in jail for a crime he did not commit simply because he has ginger hair.

Max MacAskill, 25, from Dundee, had been accused of stealing games console controllers from a shop in the city.

But he was actually in Berwick-Upon-Tweed on the day of the alleged crime.

And despite the fact prosecutors dropped the charges against him, he ended up spending a fortnight in Perth Prison

Mr MacAskill, who has a string of previous convictions, has now claimed he was charged because Tayside Police had received reports of a shoplifter with ginger hair and automatically assumed it was him.

He was only released from prison on Monday, two weeks after prosecutors dropped the charges against him.

He had been accused of stealing from Game in Dundee's Murraygate on August 4.

Mr MacAskill was arrested and appeared at Dundee Sheriff Court on August 6, where he denied all the charges.

On August 20 prosecutors wrote to Dundee Sheriff Court saying there was no further action to be taken against him.

However, rather than being released from custody, Mr MacAskill was sent back to Perth Prison where he remained until he was taken to Dundee Sheriff Court for a pre-trial hearing on Monday.

He was finally released after Sheriff Alistair Duff asked why the case was being called when it had been dropped a fortnight earlier.

Mr MacAskill said: 'I'm quite angry. On the Saturday it was supposed to have happened me and my brother were away down in Berwick-upon-Tweed.

'When the police got me I was cycling through town and they just grabbed me off the bike.

'They said they had a report of a boy
with ginger hair shoplifting and as soon as they heard that they came 
and got me. It's not fair that if any ginger boy steals they blame me.

'If they'd checked the CCTV they would have seen it wasn't me.'

Mr
MacAskill said his earlier experiences of jail had made his time in 
Perth Prison more bearable but that he would still be seeking 
compensation for wrongful imprisonment.

'It's just a lack of them 
investigating. I've been in Perth Prison a few times so it was not too 
bad but it's not right I was kept in for so long.

'My solicitor says he's going to put a claim in for me. If they had just done their job properly.

'It's not fair that if there is anybody with ginger hair they come to get me.'It's their fault, they're not doing their checks.'

He added that he was in court on August 20, the day prosecutors said there would be no further proceedings.

Mr MacAskill said: 'I was in court and was in (Tayside Police headquarters) Bell Street and they obviously didn't tell G4S security.

'So it's not really their fault, it's the court's. You can't blame the jail either.'

The Crown Office has refused to take responsibility for the blunder and claims the case remains under review, although a statement said the

Crown accepted Mr MacAskill's plea of not guilty on Monday.

A police spokeswoman said: 'Whilst we cannot comment on individual cases, where there is sufficient evidence, a report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal, and it is a decision for them whether to proceed.'
