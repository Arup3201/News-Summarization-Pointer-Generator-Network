Accused: Francesco Schettino, captain of the Costa Concordia cruise ship, arrives at the Moderno Theatre in Grosseto for the second day of his pre-trial hearing

A device on the Costa Concordia that tracks water depth had been switched off before the cruise liner struck a rock and capsized, killing 32 people, a court heard today.

A panel of court experts said that the echo sounder on the vessel was off at the time of the disaster, which happened off the Italian coast in January.

The cruise liner's captain, Francesco Schettino, 52, who was nicknamed 'Captain Coward' following the tragedy, is accused of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning ship.

He has admitted to making mistakes, but says he should not be the only one blamed.

Evidence about the sonar device were given on the second day of a pre-trial hearing, which will decide whether or not the charges against Schettino should be proceeded with.

If it is decided that the case against the captain should continue, it will go to a full trial, likely to be held next year.

The pre-trial hearing is being held in a theatre in the Italian town of Grosseto.

It is being heard behind closed doors because there is not enough room to accomodate all the media interested in the case.

More than 4,000 passengers and crew were helped from the vessel during a chaotic night-time evacuation after it capsized close to the Tuscan island of Giglio in January.

Thirty bodies have been recovered from the wreck and another two people remain unaccounted for.

The ship itself remains on its side, balanced on a rocky shelf in full view of the harbour.

Hundreds of divers and salvage engineers have begun the delicate operation of preparing the hulk for removal.

The ship's operator, Costa Cruises, has placed the blame for the disaster squarely on Schettino.

It told the hearing today that the ship had been equipped with more radar systems than needed, and that enough of them had been in operation to meet legal requirements.

Codacons, a consumer rights group that has been closely involved in the case, said more information was needed about the state of the ship's equipment before the disaster.

'All these aspects, had they been functional, may possibly have made up for the negative effects of Captain Schettino's actions and helped avoid the loss of human lives, even if the ship might have sunk nonetheless,' said Giuliano Leuzzi, a lawyer for Codacons.

The hearing has already been played black box recordings which reveal the captain saying he 'screwed up' and was 'dying' moments before the stricken vessel capsized.

Survivors listening to evidence heard Schettino saying: 'Roberto, I f***** up. Look, I'm dying here.'

Officers were also heard shouting contradictory instructions as the disaster unfolded.

The black box identified him shouting ‘hard to port!’ just before the liner struck a rock in calm waters.

At the same time his second in command yells ‘hard to starboard!’

Moments before the disaster Schettino is also heard saying: ‘Let’s go and do a salute (to Giglio).’

But as the ship goes close to the shore, he shouts at a helmsman to go to starboard to avoid catastrophe.

After hitting the rocks, Schettino orders watertight compartments in the ship to be closed. He is heard asking: ‘So are we really going down? I don’t understand.’
