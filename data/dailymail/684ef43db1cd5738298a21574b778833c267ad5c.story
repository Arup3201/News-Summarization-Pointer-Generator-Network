 President Obama told Prince Charles that Americans like the British Royal family more than their own politicians in a meeting at the White House this afternoon.

As the pair sat in the Oval Office in front of the ornate fireplace, Obama told Prince Charles: 'I think it's fair to say that the American people are quite fond of the Royal Family.'

When the 66-year-old said that news was 'awfully nice to know,' Obama added, 'They like them much better than they like their own politicians.'

President Obama joked this afternoon that Americans like the British Royal family more than their own politicians in a meeting with Prince Charles at the White House

The pair met in the Oval Office for the second time since Obama took office. Vice President Joe Biden was also present 

A slightly awkward Prince Charles responded, 'I don't believe that,' before pausing and then quickly moving the topic on to his visit the previous day to Mount Vernon, the home of America's first president, George Washington.

The two men last talked face to face almost four years ago when Charles flew to America a few days after the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

This time he was joined by his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Vice President Joe Biden made an appearance.

The Prince and the President sat together while Camilla and Mr Biden sat nearby, opposite each other on sofas.

The pair were in good spirits and were both smiling widely during the meeting 

Dozens of photographers, journalists and cameramen had been allowed into the room and the Prince looked around as camera shutters went off and boom microphones were pushed towards them.

Charles looked a little bemused but he pointed out one of the British press corps out to the President - a veteran royal photograher from the British tabloid newspaper, the Sun.

He told Mr Obama he had been photographing the Prince for more than 35 years and when he added that the first president he had reported on in the US was Ronald Reagan, the American leader replied 'Awesome'. 

In December, Prince William, who is second in like to the British throne, was invited to the White House by President Barack Obama

Obama is the sixth American president to entertain the Royal, who has visited the US on 23 separate occasions, during his royal career and is unlikely to be the last.  

Earlier in the day the Prince of Wales paid a visit to the Armed Forces Retirement Home in Washington D.C to meet veterans.

His wife Camilla looked on admiringly as Charles tried his hand at bowling but gave it a miss herself. 

The couple had begun their day by visiting President Abraham Lincoln's cottage and were met by Erin Carlson Mast who is in charge of maintaining the property.

Mrs Mast also had presents to dispense: a book entitled Lincoln's Sanctuary for Charles and another called What Do You Do With An Idea for his grandson, Prince George.

Afterwards, the royal couple were ushered to the Armed Forces Retirement Home and were whisked into the Scott Building which houses many of the residents.

Along with a visit to the bowling alley, the royal couple were also shown the library, which boasts stunning views of the Washington Monument, and the wellness facilities for the pensioners who live there. 

Outside the White House an animal rights activist wore a a goose costume to thank Prince Charles y for his opposition to foie gras.

'Charlie is my darling for banning foie gras from royal menus,' read a placard held up by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals activist.

PETA labels as cruel the force-feeding of ducks and geese required to produce the liver delicacy.

'We wanted to thank him for his kindness and for setting a good example,' the activist, Ashley Byrne, told AFP.

In 2008, Prince Charles said he had ordered his personal chefs to stop buying foie gras.
