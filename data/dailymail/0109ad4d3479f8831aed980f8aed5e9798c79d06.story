Aaron Hernandez texted a friend to 'hurry' before they allegedly murdered semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd, the jury in his murder trial heard on Friday.

But several other messages the former New England Patriots player exchanged with co-defendant Ernest Wallace were deleted from his phone after the killing, a Massachusetts Superior Court heard.

Hernandez, 25, was seen grinning in court on Friday as prosecutor Patrick Bomberg went through dozens of texts he had sent to Wallace in the days surrounding the June 17, 2013 killing of Lloyd.

The semi-pro football player, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee, was found shot to death at an industrial park near Hernandez's home in North Atteborough later that day.

Prosecutors have said Hernandez orchestrated the killing while Wallace and a third man, Carlos Ortiz, are also charged in the death. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately.  

Evidence presented on Friday showed Hernandez texted Wallace several times in the hours before the killing. In the messages, Hernandez pushed Wallace to come and see him.

One, at 9.02pm, said: 'Please make it back Cuz Im Def trying to step for a little.' Another, at 10.23pm, told him to 'hurry up' with a couple of expletives.

Also that night Hernandez wrote, 'Call her and make sure ur phone is on and charged,' apparently referring to his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins. He wrote that Jenkins was 'getting on my nerves' and that he 'ain't trying to b stuck wit her all day an nite'. 

More than a dozen calls were made to Wallace that night between 9.47pm and about 2.20am from Hernandez's phone, his lawyer's phone or the phone of his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins.

Among them, he made multiple calls to Wallace from his lawyer's phone after police asked him to go to the station, records show.

Wallace also called Lloyd five times before he died - between 1.22am and 2.32am.

The last call was made at the exact same minute Lloyd was seen on surveillance footage getting into a car outside his home. Prosecutors say the three men picked him up in a rental car before driving to the industrial park to shoot him.

Murdered: Odin Lloyd, who was dating Hernandez's fiancee's sister, was killed on July 17, 2013

Lloyd sent his last text to his sister at 3.23am and was killed within minutes, prosecutors said.

The jury also saw texts Hernandez and Wallace had exchanged in the days leading up to the killing.

On June 11, Hernandez asked Wallace if he removed everything from a car, 'clip and cds and everything?' The following day, he tells Wallace he needs 'those keys' and things are 'crazy'.

'U gotta listen yo,' he writes. 'I need them by 6 man please head back now.'

A few hours later, early on June 13, he writes: 'I wanted to kill u but u kno I love u hit me tomorrow get some rest and tell the rest I love them.'

Ricardo Leal, who works for the phone company Sprint, testified on Friday that several other text messages that appeared in records did not appear on the phone. It's not clear yet whether investigators were able to retrieve them.

Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found by a jogger on the evening of June 17. 

Police soon tied him to Hernandez because Lloyd had a key in his pocket to a Chevrolet Suburban that Hernandez had rented.

Investigators also found empty shell casings from a .45-caliber handgun nearby. They found a similar shell casing that had been removed from a rental car returned by Hernandez.

That night, police went to Hernandez's home and asked him to go to the police station, which he did.

On Thursday, jurors were shown surveillance footage of Hernandez and Ortiz at a gas station before they headed to Lloyd's Boston home.

In the footage, Ortiz was wearing a white towel around his neck and a similar towel was found at the crime scene.

The trial in Fall River is the first of two murder trials Aaron Hernandez faces this year.

Later this year, he will face a second murder trial for allegedly killing two Cape Verdean men outside a Boston nightclub in 2012.

He had a $41 million contract with the New England Patriots when he was cut from the team after being charged with Lloyd's murder.
