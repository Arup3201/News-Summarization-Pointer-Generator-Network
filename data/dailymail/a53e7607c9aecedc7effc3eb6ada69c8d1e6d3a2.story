The saying goes that 'curiosity killed the cat' and it almost got the better of one feline from San Diego.

Lulu, a long-haired Maine Coon from Rancho Bernardo, was dragged on a ten-mile drive inches from the tarmac after climbing into the bumper of a neighbor's car.

The five-year-old feline was later discovered by the driver when they returned home and heard a different type of purr coming from the engine.

Refuge: Vets say animals commonly hide near vehicles as they seek warmth

Lulu was swiftly returned to her owner, 22-year-old Allison Smith.

Smith had been searching her neighborhood overnight for the missing house cat after she slipped through an open door.

The moggy made her way over to a neighbor's home and hid in a vehicle parked outside. Vets say this commonly happens as animals seek warmth.

Lulu was then taken on a surprise road trip.

The couple who unknowingly transported Lulu had just parked their car on Tuesday afternoon when they heard meowing from under the bonnet.

Animal services were called out and a worker was able to pry the cat loose.

Despite being greasy and dirty, Lulu was not hurt.

Doting: Smith had been searching her neighborhood overnight for the missing cat after she slipped through an open door - after being reunited, Lulu was bathed with her filthy fur restored to its original tan color 

She was later reunited with Smith who was continuing with her search effort and happened to knock on the right door.

Smith's neighbor told her what had happened to Lulu the previous day.

'I started crying as soon as they said they had found her,' Smith told CBS News. 

She went to pick up her beloved animal from vets and gave her a thorough bath to restore her filthy fur to its original tan color.

Lulu has since been micro-chipped to ensure easier identification if future incidents occur.
