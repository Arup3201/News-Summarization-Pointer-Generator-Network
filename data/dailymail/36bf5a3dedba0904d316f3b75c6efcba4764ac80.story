Southern Methodist University has temporarily suspended the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity house after reports that a male student was 'held against his will' in a possible hazing incident on Saturday night.

The case is listed by SMU police as aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, personal hazing offense and unlawful restraint.

These allegations come just months after
a member of the same house was arrested for allegedly forcing 
another student to perform oral sex on him.

SMU released a statement that campus 
police are 'vigorously investigating this case' but that as the case is still an active 
investigation, 'no other information is available at this time.'

The Dallas Observer reported
on a tweet by SMU student that read 'Woo hoo SMU frat party, wazzzzam.'
It isn't yet known whether this party was at Sigma Phi Epsilon.

In November an SMU sophomore was 
indicted for allegedly forcing a classmate to perform sexual acts on him
in September, according to court records.

Serious charges: John David Mahaffey, 19, was indicted for allegedly forcing a fellow SMU student to perform oral sex on him twice in September  

John David 'J.D.' Mahaffey, 19, is 
facing sexual assault charges stemming from two incidents in which the 
Southern Methodist University student allegedly attacked another young 
man. His trial is pending in Dallas County.

On September 23, Mahaffey allegedly 
forced the other student to perform oral sex on him first in a campus 
parking garage, and then outside the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity at 
3050 SMU Boulevard, where Mahaffey is a member. 

According to an affidavit made public in September, the alleged victim told Mahaffey 'no' and 'stop' several times, but feared that the 19-year-old would get violent.

The document states that after the acts, Mahaffey, a fourth-generation SMU finance sophomore, told the young man, 'You better not tell a soul,' according to the Dallas Morning Star.

The following day, the alleged victim met with SMU police and agreed to record a phone conversation with his assailant.

During the call, the SMU student told Mahaffey, 'You know I did not want to do that?' to which the 19-year-old reportedly responded, 'I know you didn't, but we have to say it was consensual or lawyers, parent and the school will get involved.'

Legacy: Mahaffey is a fourth-generation SMU student whose great-great grandfather was among the college's founders and its first professors

Mahaffey was arrested on September 25 and charged with second-degree felony sexual assault. He was released from jail after posting a $25,000 bond.

In the aftermath of the incident, Mahaffey was suspended from the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and temporarily banned from SMU campus pending an investigation.

Mahaffey had a prominent status on campus, NBC DFW reported. The Springfield, Missouri, native was a Hunt scholar, a student senator, a scholarship committee chairman and an officer on SMU's inter-fraternity council, according to the university website.

Abuse: An affidavit released in September revealed that Mahaffey allegedly forced a male student to perform sexual acts and then tried to cover it up

According to a 2011 article in SMU's student newspaper, the Daily Campus, his great-great grandfather was a co-founder of the school and one of its first professors.

Mahaffey is a second SMU student to be arrested and indicted on sexual assault charges this fall.

Precedent: In September, Donald Cuba, 20, was indicted on sexual assault charges for allegedly raping a female SMU student in February

In September, Donald Cuba, a 20-year-old junior, was indicted on sexual assault charges related to the February 10, 2012, on-campus rape of a female SMU student. Cuba is set to go on trial March 25, 2013.

Cuba's was the first case where a grand jury has charged a SMU student for sexually assaulting another student, reported the Fort Worth Weekly.

The university has traditionally relied on a system of secret hearings for students suspected of sexual assault.

Over the past 25 years, more than 100 SMU students have reported being sexually assaulted. Yet in only one case - the three men who raped Monika Korra in 2009 - were the suspects successfully prosecuted and they were not SMU students.

SMU officials say the system - where all records are kept secret - works well. 'The university is confident in the integrity of its process and its procedures,' said SMU spokesperson Kent Best.

Serious questions have been raised in the past about the fairness of the university’s approach.

In 1990, a secret panel found an SMU student guilty of sexually assaulting another SMU student only to have a second panel overrule that decision in 1991, a decision upheld by then-President A. Kenneth Pye.
