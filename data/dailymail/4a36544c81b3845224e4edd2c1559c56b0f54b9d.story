Lavish: Drug dealer Ben Brown, 21, sold thousands of bottles of his DIY drug 'liquid Love' to revellers on the Blackpool club scene to fund his lavish lifestyle

A party-loving bodybuilder has been jailed after selling thousands of bottles of a party drug labelled 'Liquid Love' to clubbers to fund his lavish lifestyle.

Ben Brown, 21, turned his luxury flat in Lytham St Annes into a drugs den where he mixed class B drug mephedrone with water, blue colouring and vodka to sell in 10 millilitre bottles.

A fixture on the Blackpool club scene, the amateur boxer would then target stag and hen parties falsely claiming it was 'Ten Ten Liquid Love' - a lethal combination of the drugs ecstasy and GHB sold in Holland.

A landau driver by day, Brown 
would take holidaymakers up and down Blackpool sea front in his horse 
drawn carriage.

But by night he was a drug dealer selling mini bottles of his DIY drug to clubbers in the Lancashire seaside resort.

On his Facebook profile Brown proudly boasted of living for the weekends and going to the gym and on sunbeds.

He posted endless snaps of himself posing shirtless next to women in night clubs.

Others showed him on a day at the races and standing in front of £170,000 Bentley Turbo car.

Lancashire Police said Brown had been 'living a good lifestyle ' before they swooped on his plush two-bedroom flat.

Officers found designer clothing plus several
cardboard boxes containing 10,000 of his mini bottles.

Up to 1,100 of them were made up with
the drug, labelled and ready to hit the resort’s streets. A further 
9,000 empty bottles were also found ready to be filled and sold.

There was also a large decanting container 
with a tap on the end in one of the bedrooms and bottles of the mix in 
the kitchen.

When
the tamper proof sealed bottles were tested they were found to contain 
the drug mephedrone - more commonly known as 'bubble' - and vodka.

Brown 
pleaded guilty to possession of a Class B drug with intent to supply and
was jailed for three years at Preston Crown Court in Lancashire.

Detective Chris Gallagher of Blackpool CID said: 'You couldn’t hide what was there when we executed the warrant.

'This is the first case of its kind that we have come across in Lancashire and so it is hard to put a value on the drugs that Brown was selling, but we estimate he was making between £5 - £20 a bottle.'

He added that the drug was a 'dangerous mix' for users.

DC Gallagher added: 'It was a crude preparation of the drug and a user wouldn’t know what was in it.

'It was not being prepared in controlled conditions. Luckily we seized the best part of it before he had chance to profit.

'Brown had made his own crude mix of ‘liquid love’ and although a user can never be sure exactly what they are taking, they were being misled into thinking they were buying one thing but in fact were being given something entirely different.

'This is incredibly dangerous and the risks to people’s safety that were created by Brown and his business are reflected in the severity of the sentence he has been given.'
