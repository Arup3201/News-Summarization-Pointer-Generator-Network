Fined: Jonathan Dawson admitted careless driving and escaped with a fine of just £250

A motorist who caused a rail crash after jumping a level crossing in his BMW has escaped with a fine of just £250.

Jonathan Dawson, 46, could have caused a serious disaster after he failed to hear a screaming warning siren and drove straight through a level crossing 
in Woodbridge, Suffolk.

The train driver, who was travelling at about 15mph, was forced to slam on the brakes but still smashed into Dawson's 4x4, a court heard yesterday.

Dawson, who admitted careless driving at Ipswich Crown Court, amazingly escaped unhurt.

Judge
 David Goodin said last December's crash at the Lime Kiln crossing in 
Woodbridge, Suffolk, was caused by Dawson's 'momentary inattention'.

Judge
 Goodin told him: 'It is a matter of fortune that you are standing here 
at all. You could have been killed or people on the train injured or 
worse.

'The consequences weren't devastating but were potentially very serious indeed.'

Mr Duah said Dawson admitted he knew the crossing well as he used it daily to drive to a house he was building.

He had his car radio on and his sun visor down and did not hear the warning siren or see the flashing lights.

Michael
 Bromley-Martin, QC, defending, said the crossing had been the subject 
of a report by the Rail Accident Investigation branch in July.

Mr Bromley-Martin said: 'These barrier-less crossings are particularly dangerous. On that everyone agrees.'

He said seven collisions had happened there in the past ten years, and was ninth most dangerous in a list of 113 crossings nationwide recommended for upgrading.

Mr Bromley-Martin said that did not excuse Dawson's 'momentary loss of judgement' crossing the junction when the lights and siren were operating.

Dawson, of Woodbridge, was fined £250, and ordered to pay £85 costs and a £15 victim surcharge. He was also given four penalty points on his licence.

Afterwards Suffolk Coastal MP Therese Coffey said: 'I don't know all the details... but it does sound quite lenient.'

The Tory MP added: 'I think there does need to be a message that level crossings should be treated with great care.'

A Network Rail spokesman said: 'All too often we see people putting their lives and the lives of others at risk at level crossings, either through deliberately ignoring safety warnings, complacency or sheer ignorance.

'We will continue to work with the police and local authorities to highlight the dangers of crossing misuse and hope that people will learn lessons from other people's mistakes.'

A Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents spokesman said: 'The driver was very fortunate to avoid serious injury.'

'Level crossings are dangerous places and hopefully this case will serve as a warning to people that they should be used with great care.'
