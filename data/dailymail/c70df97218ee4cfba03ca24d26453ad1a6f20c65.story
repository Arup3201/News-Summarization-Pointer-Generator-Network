Amanda Knox claims in a new interview that she's not the sex deviant that she was painted as during her epic murder trial in Italy, and blames prosecutors for spreading vicious lies about her sexuality.

She told CNN's Chris Cuomo in an interview airing Tuesday night that despite her characterization in the Italian media, she has not experimented with any sort of sex games.

Knox was adamant as she told Cuomo: 'I've never taken part in an orgy - ever.'

Setting the record straight: Amanda Knox claims in a new interview that she's not the sex deviant that she was painted as during her epic murder trial in Italy

Interview: Knox told CNN's Chris Cuomo that despite her characterization in the Italian media, she has not experimented with any sort of sex games

She said she was shocked during the trial, when lawyers for the prosecution were calling her a 'whore' and a 'deviant.'

She says that Italian prosecutors made up allegations that she was a sex and drug-crazed party girl to bolster their case.

Knox said that her book, Waiting to Be Heard, is aimed at debunking those criticisms.

She said: 'In the book I talk about all my sexual experiences... I was not strapping on leather and bearing a whip.'

Knox added: 'No one has ever claimed that I was ever taking part in deviant sexual activity. None of my roommates, none of my friends, no witnesses have ever come out saying things like that.'

She also told Cuomo that now that she's home in Washington, she doesn't go to parties - and no longer smokes pot.

The many faces of Amanda: The CNN interview, in which Knox often appeared nervous and overcome with anxiety, was the latest stop in her media blitz since her book hit store shelves on April 30

Knox said: 'I don't [smoke marijuana]. 
After being in prison and seeing how drugs destroyed the lives of so 
many people around me. I just can't get near it.'

The CNN interview, in which Knox often appeared nervous and overcome with anxiety, was the latest stop in her media blitz since her book hit store shelves on April 30.

Last week, she appeared on Good Morning America with her mother, Edda Mellas, father, Curt Knox, and younger sister, Deanna Knox, as they described the effect the grueling experience has had on the Seattle family.

'I was never alone. And when everything is this storm around you and you feel like you’re being pinpointed it's terrifying to feel alone and I wasn't,' Knox said, flanked by her mother and her sister.

The day before, she appeared on ABC by herself in her first live interview with Robin Roberts.

Photographs showed Knox, wearing a 
floral shirt and khaki trousers, smiling as she was pampered by makeup 
artists ahead of the program, while later images show her timidly 
leaving the studio after the emotional interview.

When
on air, she made a tearful plea to the family of the roommate she was 
acquitted of killing - Meredith Kercher - saying: 'I really hope we can 
connect one day.'

Knox 
said she hopes the Kercher family will read her new book detailing her 
experiences in the aftermath of the slaying in November 2007 - even 
though they have said they will not.

'Meredith Kercher is the victim, 
Meredith Kercher died,' Knox said, struggling to contain her emotions. 
'Her family deserved answers; the prosecution didn't give that to them.

Outside the murder scene: Knox says she was at Sollecito's apartment on the night of the murder, and was not in her Perugia home when Meredith was killed

On April 30, the same day as the release of her book, Knox opened up to ABC's Diane Sawyer, saying that she is considering returning to Italy for the trial.

But she 
said the prospect of the case made her feel as if she had 'another field
of barbed wire to crawl through.'

And asked of those who have called her a 'she-devil,' a sexual 
thrill-seeker and a seductress, she firmly defended herself saying: 'They're wrong.'

Knox also opened up about the first time she met Kercher when they moved in together.

'I
was putting away my things in the room when she came to my room and 
introduced herself,' Knox said, adding that she thought: 'Wow, this is someone who, who I can get along with.'

Others have contrasted that Kercher found Knox's loudness and lack of ambition annoying.

'It bothers me when people suggest that she wasn’t my friend,' Knox said of their relationship.

she had been branded in the aftermath of her roommate's murder

On November 1, 2007, the Kercher's
bloody body was found in the Perugia home she shared with Knox, 
sustaining 47 wounds including a fatal slash across her 
throat.

Knox's seemingly bizarre behavior - joking around and kissing her Italian boyfriend Raffaele 
Sollecito, who was also convicted of the murder before he was acquitted - made her prime suspect.

Knox says she was never at home when it happened but was at the apartment of her boyfriend of just one week, Sollecito.

Following Knox's and Sollecito's release from prison last year, 
Sollecito moved to Switzerland while she returned to Seattle to finish 
her creative writing degree at the University of Washington.

A
third suspect, Rudy Guede, whose DNA and bloody footprints were found 
all over the crime scene, is serving a 16-year prison sentence for Miss 
Kercher’s murder.

She faces a possible re-trial in the case.
