Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez has been pictured for the first time in more than two months today, amid speculation about his health following cancer surgery.

Chavez had not been seen or heard from since he went to Havana, Cuba on December 10 for treatment, in contrast to previous medical visits.

In the photographs, the president is seen smiling and propped up on a pillow in bed, surrounded by his two daughters Rosa and Maria.

In another image, Chavez is seen reading yesterday's issue of the Cuban Communist Part newspaper Granma.

Pictures released by the Venezuelan government show Hugo Chavez with his daughters Rosa and Maria. The president had not been seen since he left the country to have cancer surgery in Havana, Cuba, in December

The pictures were shown on state television by Chavez's son-in-law, Science and Technology Minister Jorge Arreaza alongside new details about Chavez's condition.

Government opponent have been demanding to know why Chavez hasn't spoken to the nation to explain his illness.

Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said the president had overcome a respiratory infection and is breathing through a tracheal tube that makes it difficult for him to speak.

He said: 'After two months of a complicated post-operative process, the patient remains conscious, with his intellectual functions intact, in close communication with his government team.'

Villegas also said that doctors are 'applying vigorous treatment for his fundamental illness', in an apparent reference to cancer.

Villegas said the Venezuelan government thanks Cuban leaders Raul and Fidel Castro 'for the love and the care shown to our president.'

He said: 'We trust... that Comandante Chavez will overcome these delicate circumstances sooner rather than later to accompany his nation in the path to new victories,' finishing the statement by saying: 'Viva Chavez!'

Before leaving for Cuba, Chavez acknowledged there were risks and said that Vice President Nicolas Maduro should run in a new election if his cancer fight prevented him from staying on as president.

Maduro has travelled repeatedly to Havana in recent weeks, and has shown documents signed by Chavez on television while insisting the president remains in charge.

On Wednesday, Maduro said that Chavez is undergoing 'extremely complex and tough' treatments, but did not specify what they were.

Chavez was also pictured looking at the Cuba Communist Party newspaper Granma, in a shot said to have been taken yesterday

Medical experts told the Associated Press that the government's recent accounts of 'systemic medical treatment' could mean various types of chemotherapy or drug treatments, depending on the type of cancer.

The 58-year-old president has been undergoing cancer treatment in Cuba on-and-off since June 2011.

He has had tumors removed from his pelvic region, and has also undergone prior rounds of chemotherapy and radiation treatment.

Throughout the treatments, Chavez has not revealed the type of cancer or the location where tumors have been removed.Â 

Since December, the government has provided regular updates, though there have been fewer updates in recent weeks, and often with only vague descriptions of Chavez's condition.
