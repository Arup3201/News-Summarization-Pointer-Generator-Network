Outrage: Parents have blasted the 'sexualised' pole dancing classes for children at LaKiTa Dance Academy

A pole dancing class for girls as young as six has sparked outrage as parents fear their daughters are being sexualised.

Mothers have called to ban the weekend club - promoted as a type of 'gymnastics'.

But coach Lauren Kenealy has rejected criticism, claiming 'it's got nothing to do with being sexual'.

LaKiTa Dance Academy in Warrington, Cheshire, boasts champion pole dancers under the age of 13.

The website features a video of the school's six-year-old champion pole dancing to Pound The Alarm by Nicki Minaj - a sexually explicit song.

Sharing pictures of numerous other girls, the website encourages others to join 'to build core strength'.

Netmums founder Siobhan Freegard blasted the activity as 'shocking'.

She told MailOnline: 'Since when did pole dancing become an acceptable school sport?

'While the Pole Dancing Academies claim it’s nothing more than healthy exercise, why then do they need to dress up seven-year-olds in skimpy outfits and a full face of make-up, or let four-year-olds in reception class parade around a pole? 

'If it’s exercise you’re after, just let kids run races on the school playground or sports field in normal shorts and a T-shirt.

'Pole dancing is a skill and for an adult it can be a brilliant and fun way to keep fit. But it’s simply not something we should be encouraging infant and junior kids to do.

'Young children don’t understand the sexual overtones of the moves and copying them could leave them very vulnerable to exploitation.

'UK schoolgirls are already facing unprecedented pressures at a very young age. They need time to still be children, not be force to be overly body-conscious. Parents are rightly upset – and these types of displays need to ditched right now.'

Lauren Kenealy, 26, who runs the 
classes, told The Sun: 'It is just like gymnastics but using a different
 piece of apparatus. It's got nothing to do with being sexual.'

She added: 'To say it's sexualisation of children — that's totally not true. The kids just want to be monkeys.'

Last week, there was uproar after a Kent-based pole dancing club showcased primary school dancers in gold hotpants at a school fete near Swanley, north Kent.

To the outrage of one father, who wished to remain anonymous, the scantily-clad children contorted themselves around the pole in the centre of the courtyard to songs from Frozen and The Lion King.

He said: 'A lot of people were upset about it. They were performing a routine to music in inappropriate clothing and they had children doing it and I just thought, "this is so wrong".

'One of the ladies that was performing it was wearing a crop top with one of the shoulder sleeves missing - it was quite revealing.

'The shorts they had on showed more than they should and a lot of people were leaving as a result of it.'

He added: 'I don't think it would have been as bad if they had been more appropriately dressed.

'If it was a leotard, fair enough, but for what they were wearing, and having their faces made up, it just wasn't right. I felt like I was entering something quite unsavoury.'

Headteacher Sarah Warshow said they had invited Revolutions Pole Academy, based in nearby Hextable, to perform at the school fete.

The youngest performer was just four and there was also a solo show from a 12-year-old who performed to Holding Out for a Hero by Bonnie Tyler.
