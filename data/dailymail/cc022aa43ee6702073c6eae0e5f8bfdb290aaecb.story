McDonald's on Tuesday released another video focused on improving public perceptions of their fast food products--this time with a focus on the Chicken McNugget.

The video is a step-by-step look at the making of the deep-fried morsels that seems specifically designed to fix misconceptions that McDonald's uses so-called 'pink slime' meat in its nuggets.

Along with a similar video about the McRib, the campaign is pushing to change its reputation as unhealthy snack food in a country where people increasingly want options that feel more wholesome.

What's in a Chicken McNugget: Not pink slime and McDonald's really wants that to be apparent in a new how-it's-made video

Likewise, its a bid for the company to improve its bottom line. On Tuesday, the Oak Brook, Illinois-based company announced a 4.6 percent decline in sales at locations open at least 13 months.

Nearly as soon as the McNuggets video begins inside a Tyson chicken factory, the video's host whips out an iPad that shows the picture of pink goo oozing out of a tube that nauseated readers across the internet starting in 2012.

'I don't know where that picture came from, but that's not used in Chicken McNuggets,' says the Tyson staffer charged with giving the tour.

instead of the chemically separated garbage, the cameras show teams of Tyson employees studiously hacking away at whole chickens on the factory line.

What they're left with in the next step are the breast, rib meat, dark meat and skin.

Only the white meat goes into Chicken McNuggets, says the tourguide.

'No beaks? No feet?': The Tyson tour guide shows all white meat that goes into McNuggets, plus a little skin 'for flavor'

Not pink slime: 'We grind it to give you that really meaty texture that you expect in Chicken McNuggets,' says the tour guide

'This is the only part of the chicken that goes into the Chicken McNuggets,' asks the McDonald's video host. 'Nothing else? No beaks, no feet?

The tour guide gives an emphatic 'No' and it's on to the grinder.

There, both the host and tour guide are sure to point out that the ground product does not look slimey at all.

'We grind it to give you that really meaty texture that you expect in Chicken McNuggets,' says the tour guide.

Before the nuggets are formed into their iconic shapes, they get mixed with ingredients like flavor enhancers, moisture enhancers and preservatives.

A triple-step breading and battering process, that last of which imbues the nuggets with their decided golden hue and peppery/celery notes, comes next.

Then flash fry, freeze and voila!

Then company responded to outrage that emerged from a photo that showed the McRibs meat prior to being cooked in a similar way.

Both come out, no doubt, of the company's need to improve public perceptions of its product and with them its bottom line.

The world's largest hamburger chain said Monday the drop in global sales at locations open at least 13 months included a 4.6 percent decline in the U.S. and a 4 percent decline for the unit that includes the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East and Africa.

In its flagship U.S. market, McDonald's Corp. is facing with a number of challenges, including increased competition and changing eating habits, with places such as Chipotle gaining in popularity. Industry analysts say the attraction of places like Chipotle is in part that people can better customize their orders.

As McDonald's continues to struggle in the U.S., CEO Don Thompson has conceded the company hasn't done enough to keep up with shifting habits. In October, he said changes are in store for its U.S. restaurants, including the simplification of its menu.
