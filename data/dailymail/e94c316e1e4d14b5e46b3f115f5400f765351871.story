Nottingham Forest defender Danny Fox has released a picture on Instagram of his newly-dyed beard, which he hopes will raise awareness for Cystic Fibrosis.

The 28-year-old has made 12 league starts this campaign as his Forest side look to secure promotion to the Premier League.

However, off the pitch, Fox has been an ambassador for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust since May 2012, and has taken the radical step of dying his facial hair orange to draw attention to the trust and the work they do.

Speaking after joining the trust, Fox explained his personal reasons for undertaking such a role. 

'My really good friend Paul Williams died from this horrible condition at just 26 years' old in November 2012, the same age as me,' Fox said.

'We were devastated.

 'It is through Paul's grit and determination not to let cystic fibrosis define him that I realized I should do everything I can to change things.

'I want to help raise awareness and funds to stop cystic fibrosis from cutting people off in the prime of their lives.'
