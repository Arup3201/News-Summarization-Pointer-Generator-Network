Man for all seasons: Tom Watson selected Webb Simpson for his statistics in the last Ryder Cup

Bradley promised via satellite link-up not to hide any emotion when he competes on European soil as well as vowing to keep away from the Ryder Cup to continue his superstition of never touching a trophy he has not won.   

Mahan, who won The Barclays tournament last month, has enjoyed a rich run of form that has seen him top the greens-in-regulation statistics for three of the last four tournaments he has played in.

He admitted that he could now 'breathe and sleep again' after taking the call from Watson that confirmed his place on the team. 

Simpson was Watson's final pick and agreed with his fellow team members that the US are searching for 'redemption for their collapse in Medinah in 2012. 

Leading from the front: Bubba Watson was first to qualify automatically for the US Ryder Cup team

Earlier Europe captain Paul McGinley had selected Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Stephen Gallacher as his additional picks. 

Former world No 1 Luke Donald was controversially left out despite being an integral part of recent European success - being on the winning team in all four Ryder Cups he has played in - the only man to enjoy such a record. Donald has also never lost a foursomes match when the competition has been played in Europe.

Poulter, Westwood and Gallacher join the nine players who have already qualified automatically for a place in McGinley's side at golf's biggest showpiece, which starts on September 26 in Perthshire.

Rory McIlroy, the Open and US PGA champion and world No 1, is the biggest name on an all-star European team which also contains US Open winner Martin Kaymer.

Also qualified are Henrik Stenson, Victor Dubuisson, Jamie Donaldson, Sergio Garcia, Justin Rose, Thomas Bjorn and Graeme McDowell. 

'I'm in a privileged position in that I had a variety of choices and it says a lot about the European Tour and the standards we have now in Europe, the quality of the picks I have and how far we've come over the years for me to have such an abundance of talent to choose from,' McGinley said.

'There are some real quality players who have performed incredibly well who are not going to make the team. It was a very difficult call to those guys involved but on the positive side I think we have three players that will add a lot to the nine already qualified who make the European team as strong as it needs to be to take on the might of America.'
