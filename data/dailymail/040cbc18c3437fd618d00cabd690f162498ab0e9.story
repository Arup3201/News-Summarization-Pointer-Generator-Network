A 40-year-old man who was convicted aged 15 of raping and strangling to death a high school ­classmate has been paroled.

Conrad Engweiler is set to be released next month, following the decision by the Oregon parole board on Tuesday.

Engweiler has served more than 24 years for the aggravated murder, rape and sodomy of 16-year-old Erin Tonna Reynolds in the Portland suburb of Beaverton in 1990.

Conrad Engweiler (pictured in May this year) has served more than 24 years for the aggravated murder, rape and sodomy of 16-year-old Erin Tonna Reynolds in the Portland suburb of Beaverton in 1990. He is due to be released next month

A judge sentenced him in 1991 to life in prison with the chance of parole after 40 years. He was exempt from death penalty under Oregon state law due to being a minor. 

Engweiler, who has been an inmate at the Oregon State Correctional Institution in Salem, will be out in just a few weeks. 

His case has been before the courts repeatedly over the years because he was sentenced under unclear guidelines initially.

His lawyer has argued that with good behavior time considered, he's overdue for release. 

The state Supreme Court earlier told the board to start the pre-release process 'with appropriate dispatch'.

At a hearing in May, Engweiler told the parole hearing that his prison time has taught him remorse, empathy and compassion.

His release has been deferred until October 16. 

Engweiler will spend his life on parole and be supervised closely for at least three years. 

He will also be required to register as a sex offender.

Before approving his release, the parole board had ordered three separate psychological evaluations. 

The court's decision goes against the pleas of Miss Reynold's family who have begged that Engweiler spend the rest of his life behind bars, according to Oregonlive.com. 

Miss Reynolds, who had survived cancer, was found murdered outside Engweiler's father's home, buried in a pile of rubbish on February 22, 1990.

Engweiler, pictured in court in court at the age of 15, said that he had been high on drugs when he raped, sodomized and strangled classmate Erin Tonna Reynolds. He is due to be released after 24 years in jail 

She had been reported as a missing person by her parents' the evening before when she missed her curfew. 

The following morning, police were called by Engweiler's father after he reported his son missing and said that strange car was parked outside his home. 

The car was identified as Miss Reynolds' vehicle and while officers inspected the home, dogs began barking in the back yard. Drag marks to a ravine led to the 16-year-old's body under debris.  

The student was killed a few days after she had been told by doctors that she was cancer-free.

Engweiler was later found hiding out at the home of his mother's attorney and was taken into custody.  

The teenagers, both students at Sunset High School, had been on a few dates but Miss Reynolds had ended the relationship. 

At the time of his conviction, Engweiler told the court that he had was under the influence of LSD and marijuana when he killed the girl. 

Miss Reynolds' sister Beth Greear told KGW that she believed Engweiler posed 'absolutely a risk to society'.
