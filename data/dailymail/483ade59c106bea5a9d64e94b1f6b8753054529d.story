Baby-faced 'predator: Tyler Kost, 18, from Arizona, has been indicted on 27 felony counts for allegedly committing sex crimes against at least 11 girls between the ages of 12 and 17

An 18-year-old Arizona high school student has been indicted on nearly 30 felony counts for allegedly sexually assaulting a dozen girls over nearly five years.

Charges against Tyler Kost, of San Tan Valley, include multiple counts of sexual assault with a minor, sexual abuse with a minor and sexual conduct with a minor. He also faces one count of child molestation.

Pinal County Attorney Lando Voyles said the victims in the crimes alleged in the indictment issued Wednesday ranged from 12 to 17 years old.

Voyles said the offenses occurred between October 2009 and April 2014.

Kost was born in January 1996 so he was 13 when the first offense allegedly took place. But Voyles plans to try him as an adult on all charges.

‘In Arizona, once an individual turns 18, we don't have a choice,’ Voyles said. ‘[State law] makes it fairly clear.’

During a hearing last week, an attorney for Kost requested a change of venue and a gag order on the Sheriff's Office.

The judge said he could not address those requests and told the defense to bring up the issues again once Kost is formally charged. Kost is scheduled to be arraigned May 16.

Kost, a senior at Poston Butte High School, would face between 147 and nearly 334 years in prison if convicted of all the charges in the indictment, the prosecutor said.

Pinal County sheriff's deputies arrested Kost last week, accusing him of being a serial sex predator who assaulted at least 18 students.

Voyles said he could not comment on why the indictment accused Kost of crimes involving only 11 victims.

According
 to the indictment, none of the alleged sexual assaults occurred on a 
school campus. Kost is accused of sexually abusing the victims in his 
bedroom, in a parked car, a park and out in the desert.

During a news conference, Voyles encouraged parents of sexual assault victims to report the crimes to authorities.

‘Let your children know that we start by believing,’ he said.

In
 addition to calling Kost a sexual predator, Pinal County Sheriff Paul 
Babeu last week said the baby-faced Kost threatened and harassed victims
 to such an extent that two fled the state, and one attempted suicide.

‘This is a serious and serial sex offender and rapist,’ Babeu said.

The
 investigation was initiated after the Sheriff's Office received a call 
March 25 from someone reporting that Kost had sexually abused and 
molested five teenage girls.

Tyler Kost was first jailed April 28 in connection with sex crimes against one victim and re-arrested three days later as sheriff's investigators tied additional victims to the case.

In one case, Kost threatened, harassed
 and told one of the victims to kill herself, deputies said. The girl 
followed through and attempted suicide, but survived and was hospitalized.

While
 in the hospital, she allegedly got a message from Kost threatening 
that if she returned to school he would 'make her life a living hell.'

In another case, a girl became pregnant after she was allegedly raped by Kost and ended up getting an abortion, the station KPHO reported.

'He
 would assault these young female victims in their own bedrooms, in his 
bedroom, in the desert, at a community pool, at community parks,' Babeu 
said.

Detectives said because he looked young and innocent, many people didn't perceive him as a threat. His alleged victims included girls he had dated.

Kost, a senior, has been taking classes online for the past several months after reporting being bullied by several girls.

But officials with the Florence Unified School District has said that there is no evidence to support Kost's bullying claims.
