Education Secretary Nicky Morgan will announce a £5million fund to help state schools offer debating competitions, sports coaching, theatre productions and musical instrument tuition

All schools should ensure children are given character-building activities as well as a core academic curriculum, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan will say today.

She will announce a £5million fund to help state schools offer debating competitions, sports coaching, theatre productions and musical instrument tuition.

The scheme is intended to help equip state school pupils with the values and character traits needed to succeed in the workplace and compete with youngsters educated at private schools.

Mrs Morgan wants to build on reforms to the school curriculum to ensure that youngsters also receive a broad education and develop wider skills.

Schools will be encouraged to offer debating, sport, drama and other clubs at lunchtimes and after-school to instil attributes such as resilience, perseverance and the ability to work in teams.

The Coalition is already encouraging schools to consider offering longer days to allow pupils to take part in extra-curricular activities and complete homework under supervision.

Mrs Morgan will today host a roundtable event with key figures from business and charities to discuss how schools can develop a child’s character.

She will also hold up examples of state schools already excelling in character education.

They include Outwood Academy Portland, in Worksop, Notts, which offers more than 100 after-school classes ranging from extra English and maths to an orchestra, choir and debating club.

In a dramatic turnaround, the school has won an ‘outstanding’ Ofsted rating having been among the worst in the country just over two years ago. Principal Dr Phillip Smith says the introduction of a broad range of extra-curricular activities has been instrumental in the school’s success.

Meanwhile School 21, a free school in Newham, east London, has identified 21 qualities as attributes of a successful student and provides leadership and debating classes to enhance pupil’s assertiveness and public speaking skills.

With a tough new curriculum being implemented in schools this academic year, Mrs Morgan now wants to emphasise the role schools can play in equipping pupils with broader skills and attributes.

Announcing the £5million fund, Mrs Morgan said: ‘Our plan for education is to ensure all young people leave school prepared for life in modern Britain. That means not only ensuring that young people learn core academic skills and knowledge, but also that they develop the values and attributes to succeed in employment, further study and later life.

‘That’s why I want all children to experience the type of activities which develop character and resilience, both in and beyond the classroom. 

‘Whether it is the teamwork and resilience that come from playing sport, the dedication and perseverance it takes to learn an instrument or the confidence and self-expression which they may find on the stage, the fund will mean every child has the opportunity to receive a broad and balanced education.’

Mrs Morgan's predecessor Michael Gove said he wanted debating, orchestra and drama clubs to be for state as well as private schools in a speech earlier this year

The fund will be mainly targeted at schools in disadvantaged areas. It will also cover career and mentoring schemes, which are said to help prepare children for the transition into adult life.

Mrs Morgan’s predecessor Michael Gove had already outlined an aspiration to raise standards in state schools to the point where they are indistinguishable from private schools, including the range of extra-curricular activities on offer.

In a speech earlier this year, Mr Gove said: ‘I want to see state schools in England the best in the world. 

'State schools where the vast majority of pupils have the grades and the skills to apply to university, if they want to; where a state pupil being accepted to Oxbridge is not a cause for celebration, but a matter of course; where it is the norm for state pupils to enjoy brilliant extra-curricular activities like sports, orchestras, cadets, choir, drama, debating, the Duke of Edinburgh scheme, and more.

‘All those things are par for the course in the private sector – why shouldn’t children in the state sector enjoy them?’

A subsequent report from a cross-party parliamentary group insisted that Britain’s schools must be ‘more than just exam factories’.

It argued that schools should make it part of their ‘core business’ to nurture pupils’ self-belief, perseverance and ability to bounce back from set-backs.

Among the guests at today’s roundtable is Baroness Sue Campbell, chair of the Youth Sport Trust, who said: ‘I am a firm believer that Physical Education and school sport, when taught and delivered well, can help young people develop greater resilience.

‘At the Youth Sport Trust, we use the power of sport to develop young people’s confidence and self-esteem which are critically important to success - academically, in employment and throughout life.

‘I hope the discussion today recognises the importance of PE and sport in developing these skills.’
