Sully the St Bernard loves his dad so much that he can’t help but give him a big hug every time he comes home.

The massive dog could possibly be the cuddliest hound in the world as the pins his owner to the bed and doesn't let him get up.

The four-legged friend is certainly a fan of his dad, who protests half-heartedly as his giant pet traps him on the bed.

Sully the Saint Bernard loves his dad so much that he can't help but give him a massive cuddle

Sully presses his massive head down on the man’s face and shifts to take full advantage of his cuddle time.

Panting heavily, the dog refuses to budge and leans in even closer to his beloved owner. 

Sully makes himself more comfortable and even puts his big paws on the man’s chest as he leverages his massive weight, spreading it out more evenly on the bed.

The man’s partner, who is filming the video, can he heard giggling gleefully as the owner pleads and begs for the dog to let him go… but to no avail.

Instead of obeying his owner, the dog sees the entreaties as even more reason to press his weight down on the man.

He then starts furiously licking his owner’s face, who by now can barely contain his giggles.

‘Sully, let me go,’ the man says, his voice muffled out as the dog promptly lays his head on the man’s mouth to silence him.

A small scuffle ensues as the man tries to get his best friend off his body but the dog does not budge.

The love attack continues but the man grabs his chance when Sully moves ever so slightly, and tries to slip away.

His plan is foiled however as he is kept on the bed  by the dog’s massive weight, and has to lie back down, exhausted after his short struggle.

The gorgeous hound makes himself even more comfortable by fully lying down on his owner who is now well and truly trapped in the warm embrace of his best friend.

'Sully is a little on the small side for a saint bernard and weighs about 160lbs – another saint bernard from his dad weighed 230 lbs! but they tend to range between 160-200lbs,' the owner wrote on YouTube.
