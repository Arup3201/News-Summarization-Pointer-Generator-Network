A growing trend in shops using fatter child mannequins has been described by a leading children’s charity as ‘desperately sad’.

Fifty per cent of the British population is predicted to be obese by 2050 and the UK has the highest child obesity rate in Western Europe.

In a sign of the deepening crisis, one mannequin manufacturer has seen a 300% surge in requests from shops for plus-size child models.

Fat's shocking: Stores are increasingly demanding bigger mannequins

The dummies used to display clothing for seven to eight-year-olds have a standard size of 4ft in height, with a 26in chest and 22in waist.

However, many shops are requesting plus-size mannequins 20 per cent bigger, according to The Daily Mirror.

Vicky Chatten, communications executive at mannequin manufacturer Displaysense, said: ‘We’ve had a 300% increase in calls from retailers looking for much larger child mannequins, ranging from as young as four years old up to 10-year-olds. It is quite shocking and a trend that is one the increase.’

Tam Fry, of the Child Growth Foundation, told the paper that the situation was ‘desperately sad’ but added that the country needs to face up to the fact that there is now an epidemic of fat children.

The news follows controversy stirred up by clothing store American Apparel, which last week decked out its mannequins with very visible patches of untamed pubic hair.

The storefront at the retailer's East Houston location in New York features three mannequins clad in transparent white underwear, exposing their unkempt bikini lines and stopping window shoppers dead in their tracks.

But while some Twitter users have labeled the exhibition 'kinda pervy', the retailer has defended it by saying it is intended to start a conversation about society's concept of feminine beauty.
