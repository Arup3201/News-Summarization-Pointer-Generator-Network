Council workers in Telford, Shropshire, got a shock today when they carried out tests on an ash trees today and found one in particular infested with millions of caterpillars.

The insects swarmed over the tree in Sutton Way, Sutton Hill resulting in its complete defoliation.

Matthew Seabrook, Trees and Woodlands Officer for the council, said: ‘We do not believe there is any danger to the public from what is a fascinating natural phenomenon and this is nothing to do with ash dieback (a serious disease of ash trees caused by a fungus called Chalara fraxinea).

‘There does not appear to be any other tree species affected and we have not identified any outbreak on a similar scale anywhere else in the borough.‘We have taken samples to observe the caterpillars through their life cycle in a bid to identify the moth as it matures.’

Stuart Edmunds, from Shropshire Wildlife Trust, said: ‘It is incredibly rare, when there is a limited supply of trees like there is in this area the ash moth mothers could have decided to lay their eggs all in one place. Usually the caterpillars would be distributed over many more trees and with this many on a few trees there is a danger it could weaken the tree. From our point of view we would advise people not to use insecticide on these moths because at this time of year they make excellent food for the birds which are currently nesting.'

Stuart Edmunds, from Shropshire Wildlife Trust, said he believed the moths could be the larvae of the aptly named ash moth: 'It is incredibly rare, when there is a limited supply of trees like there is in this area the ash moth mothers could have decided to lay their eggs all in one place. Usually the caterpillars would be distributed over many more trees and with this many on a few trees there is a danger it could weaken the trees'

The hordes of green insects - the larval stage of a species of moth - were sighted on single ash tree by council workers in.
