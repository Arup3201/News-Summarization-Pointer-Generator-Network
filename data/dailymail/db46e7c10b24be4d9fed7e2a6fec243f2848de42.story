Holland's World Cup squad were all smiles as they prepared to board the plane to Brazil despite having to say goodbye to their loved ones on Thursday evening.

The Dutch stars posed for photographs with their wives and children at the team hotel before heading to Schipol airport to begin their journey for the summer tournament.

The likes of Wesley Sneijder and Dirk Kuyt could be seen getting close to their family and sharing a few last embraces as the adoring Dutch public wished them the best of luck.

Holland boss Louis van Gaal seemed in a relaxed mood as he turned around to give the crowd one last wave just moments before he got on the plane.

Speaking ahead of the flight, Van Gaal said: 'We're not going to South America to just join, we want to perform there. And my feeling about it is good.

'The atmosphere is good, we have grown closer together during the exercise period in all respects.

'Of course we are in a tough group, but I do not assume that we have to go home after a few games again.'
