A shirtless photograph of a Texas football coach said to resemble Ryan Gosling was shared online Monday.

Texas Tech University's head coach Kliff Kingsbury, 34, was seen next to two bikini-clad women, one of whom is a cheerleader for the Dallas Mavericks, Fox Sports reported.

Female fans have spoken fondly of Kingsbury's photograph, which went viral through the help of a Buzzfeed article.

'All I want for my birthday today is to be one of these two girls,' a user wrote.

'And people thought it couldn't get hotter in Texas! #hottestbachelor #texastuesday #kliffkingsbury,' another said.

Another user wrote 'Kliff Kingsbury's body is on point.'

A male Twitter also noted Kingsbury's physique, writing 'When I'm 34 I want to look like Kliff Kingsbury #AdamScott.'

Kingsbury has already been declared multiple times a lookalike of Hollywood actor Ryan Gosling.

Kingsbury poked fun at his image and appeared on both ESPN's Highly Questionable and SportsNation, MySanAntonio.com pointed out.

On Tuesday, Kingsbury spoke to ESPN's Highly Questionable.

'Like I've said all along, I'll take that [compliment]. But if it was somebody else - but you get an A-list celebrity, you can take that compliment,' he said on the program.

Kingsbury told Highly Questionable's hosts he's received attention from both single and married mothers.

The coach also spoke about about 'signing some cleavage' when asked about female fan interactions - which he said happened 'around five' times.

Kingsbury appeared in a segment for ESPN's SportsNation set to jazz music where he read tweets on July 24.

'Sweet Jesus, Kliff Kingsbury is HOT,' one said.

Kingsbury read another message which said 'So when can I expect my Kliff Kingsbury Sexy Red Raider 2013 Calendar?'

In September 2013, E! News reported that Kingsbury's image was printed on T-shirts, along with the message '#OurCoachIsCuterThanYourCoach.'

Speaking about his sense of dress, Kingsbury told the entertainment channel 'I guess it's not normal for coaches to dress on that side of things, but that's who I am and I never wanted to change that.'

E! News also revealed Kingsbury designed his team's uniforms.

Earlier this year, Kingbury's dance skills were also unveiled in an April dance-off with his players, CBS Sports reported.
