Belgian teenagers have written to convicted paedophile  and child-killer Marc Dutroux, asking to become pen pals with the country’s most notorious prisoner.

Dutroux  was jailed for life in 2004 over the kidnap and rape of six young teenage girls between June 1995 and August 1996, four of whom died following the ordeal.

He regularly gets large volumes of mail ranging from insults to marriage proposals to stuffed animals and even money – but has recently been receiving requests from a number of Belgian teenagers desperate to connect with the convicted murderer, according to local newspaper Le Soir.

In one letter addressed to Dutroux, the teenage writer said she believes the prisoner is an ‘honest’ man.

‘Hello, I’m a 15-year-old girl. I live in La Roche-en-Ardenne. You have always fascinated me. You’re a famous person. When I see your handsome photos, I can’t help but believe you are honest,’ the girl wrote before the letter was confiscated by prison officials.

‘Would you like to correspond with me? If you want, I can send my picture.’

The teenagers sending Dutroux letters now weren’t even born when his infamous rapes and murders traumatised Belgium in 1996.

Child psychiatrist Jean-Yves Hayez said Dutroux appeared to be a ‘victim of the system’ in the eyes of an ‘immature adolescent’.

‘They are rubbing shoulders with the forbidden, with danger, likening their behaviour to that of adults,’ he said.

‘They aren’t aware of the risk they are running.’

Dutroux sent a letter to the father of one of his victims last month, repeating his claim his former wife Michelle Martin and accomplices were largely responsible for his crimes.

His ex-wife was also convicted after found guilty of helping him hold the girls captive and playing a role in the killing of two who were found starved to death in a locked cellar.

She was freed on parole in 2012 after serving 16 of her 30-year sentence in prison.

Dutroux is also seeking early release, but is almost certain to be rejected when he fronts the parole board later this year.
