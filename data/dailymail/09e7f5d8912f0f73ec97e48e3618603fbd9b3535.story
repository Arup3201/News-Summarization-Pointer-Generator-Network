A teenager plagued by bullies over a dip in his chest claims he nearly died when doctors found his heart had started to grow around a metal bar inserted to disguise his sunken chest.

Euan Russell opted for the cosmetic procedure to have the bar fitted when he was 15 years old.

But when his heart started to beat 'like a slush machine', Euan claims doctors found his heart was growing around the metal and was just one centimetre away from killing him.

Euan said he underwent the first ever emergency surgery to remove a metal bar from the heart, miraculously surviving the 16-hour heart bypass operation.

Euan Russell, 18, was bullied over a severe dip in his breastbone. Determined to beat the bullies he opted for a cosmetic procedure to have a metal bar fitted to correct the dip. But he claims after noticing an irregular heartbeat, doctors told him his heart had started to grow around the metal bar leaving him close to death

Euan, now 18, said: 'When I woke up from the surgery I screamed "I'm alive".

'I didn't think I was going to come through it. Nobody expected me to come through it.

'It had never happened in medical history. I had eight consultants during the operation.

'I felt unlucky but also lucky at the same time. I felt lucky to be alive but unlucky that this had happened to me.'

Euan was born with pectus excavatum - an abnormal development of the rib cage where the breastbone caves in, resulting in a sunken chest wall deformity.

The teenager, from Cresswell in Northumberland, first started to research the operation to raise his swollen chest condition in 2011.

'The condition started to get on my nerves,' he said. 'It affected my confidence hugely because in PE all the lads would stare and point at me.

'Girls would be put off by it which felt awful. So I started to look into the operation.'

Euan underwent the 'Nuss' procedure at the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle on the NHS, to insert the bar and correct the position of his ribs on September 23, 2011.

But months later in February 2012, Euan was found to be suffering an inflammation of his heart sac, as a result of the previous operation. 

The bar put pressure on his heart causing it to inflame and he needed a further operation to remove fluid.

When Euan was 15 he went into the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle to have the cosmetic operation. But months later in February 2012 he was found to be suffering inflammation of the heart sac

A year after his first operation, Euan said he noticed his heart making a strange noise. He said: 'The doctor said "the bar has flipped around and gone into your heart"... My heart was growing around the bar and if it moved a centimetre to the right or to the left it could have killed me'

He said: 'I knew something wasn't right. My heart was beating at 212 beats per minute. It is only supposed to beat between 60 and 80 per minute.

'I was admitted to hospital again with peritonitis and I underwent a second operation to reposition the bar.

'After the surgery I had to have a little bucket of heart juice next to me or three days while fluid was drained from my heart.

'I started to feel really down. Everything was going wrong and I thought the whole world was coming down around me.'

Pectus excavatum is a condition in which a person's breastbone is sunken into his or her chest.

In severe cases, it can look as though the centre of the chest has been scooped out, leaving a deep dent.

While the sunken breastbone is often noticeable shortly after birth, it worsens as the child enters adolescent.

It is more common in boys than girls and severe cases can eventually interfere with the function of the heart and lungs.

Even in mild cases, the condition can make young people feel self-conscious about their appearance.

Surgery can help correct the deformity.

Within time Euan's health began to improve and he started to visit the gym and put on weight.

But his condition went downhill in September 2013 when Euan started to notice his heart making a strange noise.

Euan, who has two sisters Louise, 21, and Alice, 23, said: 'The day before I was due to go back to school after summer I heard my heart beating and it was not a normal sound.

'It sounded like a slush machine. I went downstairs and told my step-dad Richard, who is a doctor, and he told me it was a heart murmur and I should get it checked out.

'I booked an appointment for  September 7 and what should have only been a five or 10-minute check up lasted half an hour.

'I was kept in hospital for two or three days before anybody told me what was going on.

'The doctor said "the bar has flipped around and gone into your heart".

'It didn't feel real. It was a surprise as I thought I was in the best health I had ever been.

'My heart was growing around the bar and if it moved a centimetre to the right or to the left it could have killed me.

'I had to go for an emergency heart bypass operation. My mum didn't think I was going to come through it.'

Euan survived the dramatic surgery and the bar was removed from his chest.

One year on, he is looking forward to studying photographic journalism at Leeds Metropolitan University.

He said: 'It's been a hell of a journey and I am absolutely over the moon to be able to start the next stage of my life.

'I still have a dint in my chest but I cannot care less what it looks like now as I am lucky to be here.'

Sasha Stamenkovic, consultant thoracic surgeon at the Freeman Hospital, said: 'Mr Russell had a routine operation placing a rib bar for a chest wall deformity in December 2011.

'He was kept under review and in September 2013 unfortunately succumbed to a known complication of bar “migration”, whereby the bar is enveloped by the growing heart immediately behind it (it is for this reason that the bar is removed between two and three years post-operatively).

'As a result of this complication he had an urgent (not emergency) operation to remove the bar which took place following a multi-disciplinary team discussion.

'After surgery he made a quick recovery and was seen again in clinic to monitor his progress.'
