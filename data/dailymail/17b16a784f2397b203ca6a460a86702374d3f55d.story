She's the only player in England’s World Cup-winning women’s rugby team to have had a baby – but don’t think it’s put her at any disadvantage.

For Emma Croker says her traumatic experience of childbirth has made her even tougher on the pitch.

And the 31-year-old said she hoped her experience of juggling professional sport and childcare, as well as a job as a PE teacher, would inspire other women with families.

Emma Croker, 31, pictured here with her two-year-old daughter Lucy, is the only mother in the England women's rugby team, but says she hopes her experience of juggling work, professional sport and motherhood will inspire other women

‘After you’ve gone through childbirth, you don’t fear pain anymore,’ she told the Daily Mail. ‘I don’t think anything in rugby is going to be as painful as childbirth.

‘It’s worth it in the end. Ask any mother and it’s worth it to have that little baby in your arms.

‘The experience has made me live for the moment – I want to win every game. But at the end of the day I still have my family to go home to. That’s my number one priority.

‘That’s what’s so great about having a family – whatever’s happening in your job or your rugby or your career, they’re there for you and you can’t be sad in front of your children, they just make you happy.’

Mrs Croker was diagnosed with pre- eclampsia – a condition which can prove fatal for the mother and unborn child – meaning an emergency Caesarean was the only option.

But despite the toll on her body, she returned to the rough and tumble of the pitch in her position of hooker after only four months.

Mrs Croker, from Essex, is pictured being tackled in the World Cup semi-final against Ireland. The England team took the title for the first time in 20 years

She said: ‘Having people tackling you 
and having impact on the area where you’ve had the C-section was quite 
scary, but I had a couple of mates at my club in Richmond who tackled me
 in the corner to see if it wasn’t too bad.

‘The best thing to do is to get back in the game and give it a shot and see what happens.’

Like
 any high-powered woman, Croker knew having a baby might mean the end of
 her career, but her determination to get her fitness back meant she won
 her place back almost immediately.

Now Mrs Croker, from Billericay in Essex, takes two-year-old daughter Lucy with her on tour.

The rugby player - who is also a PE teacher - takes her daughter with her on tour and says she loves it

With the help of her husband James, 35, an RAF rugby coach, and mother Carole Layland, 59, a caterer, she was able to juggle looking after Lucy with her job and training.

Croker says the battle wounds she sustains during rugby matches are nothing compared to childbirth

‘Having a family was important to me,’ she added. ‘It’s not easy, you need a massive support network behind you, but you can do it – women don’t have to stop their career or sport once they’ve had their baby.’

Women rugby players, in contrast to their male counterparts, receive no sponsorship to play.

As a result all members of the women’s team have day jobs – including a vet, lifeguard, plumber and several teachers – and they get reimbursed for the days they have taken off work as payment.

Yesterday, as the team was welcomed home from the competition in France by cheering crowds at Twickenham, Lucy was allowed to get her hands on the cup.

‘She loved it,’ Mrs Croker said. ‘It was a great privilege for us to win this year, never mind have my daughter there. It’s an experience not many people get to share with their kids.

‘She’s really sporty, and she’s always running and jumping off things. So hopefully she’ll get into a sport when she’s older.’

Sunday’s victory was the first time the England women’s rugby team have won a World Cup in 20 years, with the last win in Scotland in 1994.

It marks a high point in a long battle for the women, who made it through to the finals in 2002, 2006 and 2010 but missed out each time at the last hurdle.

Croker said she hoped Sunday’s victory would inspire other women to take up rugby, which is still seen as a men’s sport by many.

She added: ‘When we first started playing and first started getting media coverage there were a few negative comments but we just answer it by saying, “come and watch our game”.

‘Since people have been able to watch us on TV, it’s changed people’s opinions. What they see is a good game of rugby.’
