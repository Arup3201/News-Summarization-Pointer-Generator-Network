The 40-year-old man accused of attacking V.Stiviano in a racist assault which left her face severely bruised intends to deny the charges, his lawyer has said.

Dominick Diorio made a brief court appearance on Wednesday and was released without bail.

He did not speak to waiting reporters but his attorney David Scott Smith said he expects the allegations to 'begin to fail' as soon as they are examined with more scrutiny.

He went on to accuse Stiviano of inventing the attack in order to gain publicity or to 'keep her name in the spotlight'.

'Simply put, a credible victim of a crime does not have her attorney call the press before she calls the police,' said Smith.

'Miss Stiviano seems intent on keeping her name in the spotlight. But I can assure you if this case goes to trial, my cross-examination will last longer than her 15 minutes of fame.'

Accused: Dominick Diorio made a brief court appearance on Wednesday and was released without bail

Shocking: These two images - taken on Sunday night and the next day - reveal what appears to be serious bruising and swelling suffered by V.Stiviano in the alleged racially motivated assault she suffered over the weekend in Manhattan

Dominick Diorio, 40, of Old Bethpage, New York, was originally charged with third-degree assault as a hate crime, assault, harassment and aggravated harassment

Arraignment: This is Dominick Diorio on Wednesday outside Manhattan Criminal Court where he was released without bail

Pictures which V. Stiviano claims are proof she was assaulted in New York City were released yesterday by MailOnline

The images allegedly show extensive bruising across the right side of the 31-year-old's face.

In
 one photograph, taken after Sunday's alleged assault outside the 
Gansevoort Hotel, a stunned looking Stiviano has what appears to be a 
huge florid mark burgeoning from her eye down to her chin.

In
 the other, which was presumably taken the day after, Stiviano's face 
seems to be painfully swollen, especially around her cheek.

Even though she is wearing make-up in one of the photographs, the effects of the alleged attack appear to be visible.

Diorio, of Old Bethpage, Long Island, appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court for his arraignment.

He was initially changed with assault and a hate crime but these charges were reduced to assault in the hearing.

Diorio's attorney, David Scott Smith, told The New York Post that he is pleased the hate crime charges have been dropped.

'I’d like to commend the District Attorney’s Office for deciding not to prosecute my client for a hate crime and to consent to his release without bail,' said Smith.

'I’m confident that as this case goes forward and the investigation continues, that Miss Stiviano’s allegations will likewise begin to fail and at the end of the day, the assault charge will be dismissed as well.'

Diorio, who was reportedly celebrating his 40th birthday before the alleged run-in with Stiviano, appeared to have a small amount of bruising on his face.

He allegedly told investigators he just 'slipped and fell' after a woman threw a phone at him.

However, Stiviano offers an alternative explanation for his injuries.

She claims he and another man allegedly hurled racist abuse at her during a random attack on Sunday evening.

She claims their slurs included the N-word.

Diorio allegedly became involved in an argument with Stiviano inside Revel restaurant, which is near to the Gansevoort hotel in Manhattan's meatpacking district.

She alleges Diorio and his friends followed her and her two female dining companions until they were outside the hotel and then pounced.

'The defendant and another unapprehended individual followed her down the street while repeatedly calling her a ‘[n-word] bitch’ and a ‘whore,’ according to Stiviano's criminal complaint.

'The defendant reached through an open taxi window and struck her in the face with his closed fist.'

According to Stiviano, Diorio and his friend spat at her before screaming racial obscenities at her.

’Yeah, I’ll f*****g hit a girl. I’ll hit you, you n****r b***h,’ the DA quoted Diorio as saying according to The New York Post.

Because Stiviano and her lawyer Mac Nehoray had not filed a police report on Sunday, officers had not been investigating the fight.

But on Monday Stiviano filed a complaint with the NYPD and on the same day Diorio turned himself into police.

He was identified in surveillance footage by police and then put in a lineup and picked out by Stiviano on Tuesday.

Diroio currently lives with his parents and his father told The New York Post of his shock.

Recorded: Donald Sterling was recorded making racist remarks that resulted in an NBA ban in April and a fight over ownership of the Clippers

Stiviano recorded the racist rant that was leaked and led to Sterling's ejection from professional basketball.

He then handed control of team to his wife Shelly before a $2 billion deal to sell the franchise was agreed with former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.

It came just days before an NBA panel was due to meet to discuss revoking Sterling's ownership over the team in light of the racism scandal last month.

However the deal has yet to go through as it has to be approved by the NBA and Sterling is believed to be fighting it.

Sterling had bought the Clippers for $12.5 million in 1981.
