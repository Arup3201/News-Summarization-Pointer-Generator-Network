Surgeon: Dr David Berry, pictured, had been at University Hospital Wales for 18 months

A surgeon has been suspended after being linked with eight allegedly avoidable deaths.

The General Medical Council’s ban on David Berry performing liver surgery follows a review of the cases of 31 of his patients. It found that ten had died and 'eight of those ten deaths were avoidable'.

Concerns about the consultant were first raised through normal monitoring procedures.

Mr Berry was put on restrictive practice for an internal investigation to be carried out and this led to him being suspended while he was referred to the GMC.

A team from the Royal College of Surgeons then held an in-depth investigation which uncovered the eight 'avoidable deaths' linked to his work at University Hospital Wales in Cardiff.

The surgeon, who moved there from the Leicester area, had been working for the Cardiff and Vale  University Health Board, which runs the hospital, for 18 months.

Yesterday bosses revealed the full extent of their findings as the partner of one of the eight patients began legal action.

Martyn Rogers, 66, from Newport, South Wales, died of blood poisoning and acute liver failure last summer.

Within three days of undergoing a liver surgery procedure, his organs began shutting down and it was discovered that one of his major veins had been damaged.

His death on July 25 last year came one week after Dr Berry carried out an operation to remove tumours from his liver. Maria Davies, his partner of 40 years, has instructed medical law experts at Irwin Mitchell to launch an investigation.

She is concerned about the care other patients may have received.

In a statement, she said: ‘We were led to believe that the surgery would remove the tumours and ultimately prolong his life.

‘To learn that Martyn’s death could have been avoided is very difficult to comprehend and has left me feeling angry. I want to know why his treatment was not better and I am also concerned that other patients may have been affected as the report suggests poor operative skills were partly to blame.

'I would also like to know what steps are being taken by the board within the hospital to ensure no one else suffers the same unnecessary ordeal.’

A spokesman for Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said: 'A liver surgeon working at the University Hospital of Wales was fully suspended from duty in January 2013 following concerns about the outcomes of some liver patients in his care.

'The UHB commissioned a second, detailed review by the Royal College of Surgeons of the individual care of some 31 patients who underwent complex liver surgery by this surgeon, ten of whom sadly died following that surgery.

'The outcome of this detailed review showed that eight of those ten deaths were avoidable.'

Medical director Dr Graham Shortland, said the UHB’s normal checks on surgeons’ clinical outcomes had identified the original concerns and no current liver patients were at risk. ‘Every death is a tragedy for the family concerned, but we do not underestimate the impact of a death in these circumstances,’ he added.

‘We would like at the outset to put on record our unreserved apologies to Miss Davies, and every family who has been affected.’

Emma Rush of Irwin Mitchell said: ‘The report into Martyn’s death is deeply concerning and Maria understandably wants answers.’

The UHB has set up a helpline number: 0800 952 0244.
