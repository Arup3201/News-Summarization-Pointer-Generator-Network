Revelations: Part of the manuscript containing the newly deciphered Passion story of Jesus

A newly deciphered Egyptian text which dates back almost 1,200 years tells part of the crucifixion story of Jesus with never heard before apocryphal plot twists.

The ancient text tells of Pontius Pilate, the judge who authorised Jesus' crucifixion, offering to sacrifice his own son in the place of Jesus.

The text also claims that Jesus had the ability to change shape and puts the day of the arrest of Jesus on Tuesday evening rather than Thursday evening - contravening the Easter timeline.

Roelof van den Broek, of Utrecht University in the Netherlands, published the translation in the book Pseudo-Cyril of Jerusalem on the Life and the Passion of Christ (Brill, 2013).

He said the text doesn't mean these events happened, but that some people living at the time appear to have believed in them.

Copies of the text are found in two manuscripts, one in the Morgan Library and Museum in New York City and the other at the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania.

Most of the translation comes from the New York text, because the relevant text in the Pennsylvania manuscript is mostly illegible.

Van den Broek wrote in an email to LiveScience that while apocryphal stories about Pilate are known from ancient times, he has never heard of Pilate offering to sacrifice his own son in the place of Jesus.

The text in translation says: 'Without further ado, Pilate prepared a table and he ate with Jesus on the fifth day of the week. And Jesus blessed Pilate and his whole house.'

Pilate is said to later tell Jesus: 'Well then, behold, the night has come, rise and withdraw, and when the morning comes and they accuse me because of you, I shall give them the only son I have so that they can kill him in your place.'

In the text, Jesus comforts him, saying: 'Oh Pilate, you have been deemed worthy of a great grace because you have shown a good disposition to me.'

Jesus also showed Pilate that he could escape if he chose to. The text continues: 'Pilate, then, looked at Jesus and, behold, he became incorporeal: He did not see him for a long time ...'.

Pilate and his wife both have visions that night that show an eagle - representing Jesus - being killed.

The Last Supper: The text moves the date of Jesus' Last Supper from Thursday to Tuesday - and suggests it took place with Pontius Pilate

Van den Broek said the Coptic and Ethiopian churches regard Pilate as a saint, which explains the sympathetic portrayal in the text.

The text is written in the name of St. Cyril of Jerusalem who lived during the fourth century.

Near the beginning of the text, Cyril, or the person writing in his name, claims that a book has been found in Jerusalem showing the writings of the apostles on the life and crucifixion of Jesus.

The text reads: 'Listen to me, oh my honored children, and let me tell you something of what we found written in the house of Mary...'.

Van den Broek said it's unlikely a book was found in real life and that a claim like this would have been used by the writer 'to enhance the credibility of the peculiar views and uncanonical facts he is about to present by ascribing them to an apostolic source.'

Van den Broek added that he is surprised that the writer of the text moved the date of Jesus' Last Supper, with the apostles, and arrest to Tuesday. In fact, in this text, Jesus' actual Last Supper appears to be with Pontius Pilate. In between his arrest and supper with Pilate, he is brought before Caiaphas and Herod.

In the canonical texts, the last supper and arrest of Jesus happens on Thursday evening and present-day Christians mark this event with Maundy Thursday services.

Van den Broek writes that it 'remains remarkable that Pseudo-Cyril relates the story of Jesus' arrest on Tuesday evening as if the canonical story about his arrest on Thursday evening (which was commemorated each year in the services of Holy Week) did not exist!'

About 1,200 years ago the New York text was in the library of the Monastery of St. Michael in the Egyptian desert near present-day al-Hamuli in the western part of the Faiyum.

The text says, in translation, that it was a gift from 'archpriest Father Paul', who, 'has provided for this book by his own labors'.

The monastery appears to have ceased operations around the early 10th century, and the text was rediscovered in the spring of 1910.

In December 1911, it was purchased, along with other texts, by American financier J.P. Morgan. His collections would later be given to the public and are part of the present-day Morgan Library and Museum in New York City. The manuscript is currently displayed as part of the museum's exhibition 'Treasures from the Vault' running through May 5.
