Parents are welcoming the return of their adult offspring back home as they admit living with their grown-up children can actually be a good thing.

Rather than viewing the return of their children to the family home as a nuisance, more parents now admit there are mutual benefits to the boomerang generation.

In a role reversal, parents confess their offspring are now available to provide a free taxi service as well as contribute to housework and pay their share of bills.

Parents said the return of their adult offspring home because of money and relationship issues actually turns out better than they had expected, dispelling myths about the problems of the 'boomerang generation'

Around 75 per cent of parents say their adult children now pay for their keep and 43 per cent say they like having their offspring back at home so they know they are eating properly, the survey by E.ON and Age UK found. 

Nine percent also confess they use their children as a taxi service. 

Four in ten parents say living together again with their children has actually worked out, compared to ten per cent who confess the experience has been worse than they feared. 

This will be welcome news to today's boomerang generation who are moving back home to be with their parents up to three times during their lives. 

Divorce and relationship breakdowns are the main reasons adults return, while almost a quarter move back temporarily while they save to buy their own home.

The UK now has around 300,000 multi-generation households - up 20 per cent on pre-recession levels.

The number of multi-generation houses have increased, with more adults moving back home with parents

Saving for a house, divorce and relationship breakdowns are the main reasons adults move back home

While 31 per cent have moved back home, 21 per cent confess to having done so on at least three occasions.

And it would appear that grown up offspring are also happy with the arrangement, as 43 per cent enjoy going back to live with their parents and their home cooking. 

David Bird, Residential and Customer Operations Director at E.ON which did the study, said: 'There are a number of factors that have caused the Boomerang Generation trend - a major one being the rising cost of living.

'If there are suddenly more people under your roof, it's important to look at household utilities, including your energy bill, to see where you can make savings.' 

Parents say there are benefits to having their adult children back home, including a free taxi service 

The latest report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies found that more than one in four 22 to 30-year-olds depend on their parents for somewhere to live. One of the main reason for this is that this age group were among the hardest hit during the recession - having been more likely to lose their jobs and suffer decreases in their incomes. 

The news that more returning offspring are now contributing to the family purse when they return home will also be welcome to parents, anxious about meeting the continuing costs of supporting them. 

In a survey last month, 44 per cent of parents said they were having to put off retiring because of the cost of funding their adult children, many of whom may have depended on them for extra funds after completing university.  

Gordon Morris, Managing Director at Age UK Enterprises, said: 'It's encouraging to see older parents and adult children are finding living together positive.

'It's important to be open and discuss factors such as bills and domestic chores when living under one roof; keeping an open dialogue helps ensure everyone is happy with the situation.

'It's equally important people in later life are aware of steps they can take to keep bills down regardless of whether their children have returned home to live with them.'
