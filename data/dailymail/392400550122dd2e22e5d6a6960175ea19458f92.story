A 21-year-old nursing student has died after a drunk driver plowed into her as she cycled home from the library after a day of studying.

Kristina Chesterman, from Livermore, California, was left brain dead by the horrific accident just a block from her home near the Chico State University campus, her distraught mother said.

On Tuesday, her devastated family said their goodbyes as they made the agonizing decision to switch off her life support and donate her organs.

Loss: Kristina Chesterman, pictured right in her nurse scrubs, has died after being hit by a drunk driver

The promising second year student had been riding in the bike lane just before 11pm on Sunday when Riley Hoover, 19, allegedly smashed into her with his GMC Envoy - carrying her 120 feet and taking her bicycle another 210 feet.

Officers responded to the scene as dispatchers received further calls about a driver striking a parked vehicle while entering an apartment complex about a third of a mile away, the Chico Enterprise-Record reported.

Police responded to that scene and discovered that vehicle damage and missing parts found at the crash scene connected Hoover to the accident.

He was arrested at 11.21pm on suspicion of felony hit-and-run 
and felony driving under the influence causing serious injury or death.

Missed: Her heartbroken mother Sandra (pictured with Kristina) said her daughter was less than a block from home when she was hit by the SUV and dragged for 120 feet, leaving her brain dead

Promise: Relatives and friends remembered Kristina as a stand-out student and kind, considerate friend

Scene: Her destroyed bike (pictured) was carried for another 200 feet by the 19-year-old drunk driver

Now that Chesterman has died, an additional charge of gross vehicular manslaughter will be 
sought against Hoover. He remains at Butte County Jail in Oroville.

On Monday morning, Chesterman's distraught mother Sandra shared her pain on Facebook.

'Feeling an unbelievable, unimaginable loss right now,' she wrote.

'At 11:04 pm last night my beautiful baby girl Kristina was struck by a 19-year-old drunk driver while she road her bike in the bike lane home from study hall. She was less than one block from home.

'The driver just left her in the road to die and went on to crash into two more cars then stumbled into his apartment and passed out drunk... Please keep us in your thoughts and prayers.'

Officials at Enloe Medical Center notified Chico Police that Chesterman had succumbed at 1.40pm on Tuesday. She was a registered organ donor.

Loved: Friends and neighbors gathered outside her Livermore home on Tuesday for a candle-lit vigil

On Tuesday, friends and neighbors held a candlelight vigil in front of her family's home in Livermore. She graduated from Granada High School, where she was a cheerleader, three years ago.

Those at the vigil told KTVU that losing Chesterman was devastating.

'I never met a person more caring and loving,' her friend Morgan Burbach told the station. 'She was going to make an amazing nurse. She loved it. It was her passion.'

Another friend added: 'I lost my best friend to a fool who made one bad decision and no amount of punishment will give back what we all lost.'
