Cara Delevingne is once again supporting the campaign for topless rights, posting two provocative images to her six million followers on Instagram.

The 21-year-old posted a snap denoting the anatomical similarities between the male and female breasts drawn on a topless man and woman’s bodies.

Under the man’s photo is the word ‘Free’, while under the woman’s picture – who has tape across her nipple – is the word ‘Censored’.

Chest to impress: Michelle's former flame Cara Delevingne is also a supporter of the Free The Nipple campaign and posted this snap to her Instagram account

Cara, 21, is known more for her catwalk success and party lifestyle than strong feminist leanings

It is not known whether it is Cara in the photo.

Never one to shy away from controversy, the model first posted a picture of a woman in a flesh-coloured bikini top complete with realistic nipples.

It comes after Cara was in February seen wearing a ‘Free the Nipple’ T-shirt, which featured a pair of breasts emblazoned across her own chest, during a high-profile visit to the home of the American Ambassador, where she was joined by Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran.

The ‘Free the Nipple’ campaign is an equality movement that uses social media and film to fight against censorship laws in the US, where it is illegal in 37 states for women to appear topless.

It has gained the support of celebrities including Rumer and Scout Willis and Rihanna.

Cara is obviously feeling more politicised of late.

The model followed her two provocative pictures with a e-Card accompanied with the phrase 'It's about time for equality #EQUALITY'

Known more for her catwalk success and
 chaotic party lifestyle than strong feminist leanings, the waif-like 
beauty followed her two provocative pictures by posting an e-card on 
Instagram.

It read: ‘Just thought you should know every single Senate Republican just voted against equal pay for women.’ She included the message: ''It's about time for equality #EQUALITY'

But her new found political zest has not totally detracted the Burberry model from her usual activities.

Rumer Willis attended the Free The Nipple fundraiser in Los Angeles, which aims to 'to end this insane war on women's boobs!', in the U.S it is illegal for women to be topless in 37 states

On Sunday, actress Caitlin Stasey spent the day braless and publicised it via social media in solidarity with the movement

As well as sharing sneak peeks of her latest campaign for Chanel, the British beauty has had time to add to her already extensive collection of body art.

She posted a picture of an unusual ‘Breathe Deep’ white tattoo on her Instagram yesterday.

The message, written in curly lower-case font, is deliberately designed to be discreet - only visible when she has a tan.
