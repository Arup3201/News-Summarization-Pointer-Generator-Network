Liverpool striker Rickie Lambert has turned down the opportunity to move to Aston Villa.

Sportsmail understands the two clubs were in advanced talks but boyhood Reds fan Lambert did not want to leave Anfield so soon after joining.

Brendan Rodgers' side were reportedly open to a deal providing their £5million asking price was met, but the deal is now off after Lambert told the club he was not interested in leaving.

The 32-year-old, who was also a target for Crystal Palace and West Brom, insisted last month that he would only leave if Liverpool told him they 'no longer wanted him'.

Villa are desperate to sign attacking reinforcements after having failed to score in each of their last six Premier League matches - a new club record. 

But Villa manager Lambert is ready to let Callum Robinson out on loan to Preston North End even though that would leave Villa a striker short.

The 20-year-old forward was recalled from the club following a successful loan spell earlier this season as Villa became light in attacking options.

But he could be on the verge of heading back to Deepdale, suggesting Lambert may be positive about an incoming in that position.
