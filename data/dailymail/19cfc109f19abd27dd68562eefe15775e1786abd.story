Manchester United target Juan Cuadrado was substituted after 24 minutes of Fiorentina's Europa League defeat by Dinamo Minsk because his mind was elsewhere, according to his manager Vincenzo Montella.

Forward Cuadrado has been the subject of much transfer speculation since he had an outstanding World Cup, helping Colombia to reach the quarter-finals, and has been linked with a move to Old Trafford.

But Fiorentina boss Montella was forced to haul the 26-year-old off during the first half on Thursday night.

'He's suspended on Sunday (against Cesena) so I tried to play him from the start. I saw that his mind wasn't totally on the match, so I preferred to substitute him,' said Montella.

Fiorentina suffered a shock 2-1 home loss to the Belarus team and although the Italian club had already qualified for the knockout stages before the game, Montella was furious with the performance.

'It was an important match for me, I don't like to lose even when I'm playing against my son,' he said. 'I take this seriously, I'm ashamed and I apologise to everyone.

'I'm afraid that I was unable to transmit what I wanted from this game. I expected more, because there is a clear difference between these two teams.'

Fiorentina are a modest ninth in Serie A where they have managed only 16 goals in 14 games. Despite Thursday's defeat, they finished top of Europa League Group K.
