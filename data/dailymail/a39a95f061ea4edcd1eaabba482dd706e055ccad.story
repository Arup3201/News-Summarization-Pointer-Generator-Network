Three men being sought by police over the alleged racist incident involving Chelsea football fans on a Paris Metro train have been identified, detectives revealed today.

Scotland Yard released images of the men they believed they were among a group of supporters who allegedly pushed a black man off the train and chanted a racist song in France on Tuesday.

The Metropolitan Police said the three men had now been identified and the force was liaising with the French authorities. None of the men sought by Scotland Yard have been arrested.

Identified: Scotland Yard released images of the men they believed they were among a group of supporters who allegedly pushed a black man off the train and chanted a racist song in France on Tuesday 

Pushed off the train: The shocking footage was filmed before the Premier League team's 1-1 draw in a Champions League fixture with Paris Saint-Germain at Parc des Princes 

The Chelsea fans could be heard chanting 'We're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it' on the train

Supporters have identified five people as either witnesses or participants in the incident, which happened ahead of Chelsea's Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain.

They are Josh Parsons, a 21-year-old City worker, and his younger brother, Benji; Jordan Munday, 20; Mitchell McCoy, 17; and 23-year-old Jamie Fairbairn.

A police spokesman said the force cannot arrest people for offences which happen outside the UK but ‘a number of people’ have now been spoken to in relation to the incident.

Footage posted online showed the commuter - named in reports as Souleymane S - being pushed back on to the platform amid chants of ‘we're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it’. 

Circled: Jordan Munday has been named locally as  being on the train.  There is no suggestion he was involved in the pushing of the passenger or the racist chanting but could be a key witness for police

Five people have so far been suspended from Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground following investigations into the incident.

The club has reiterated its promise to ban for life anyone proved to have been involved in the altercation and is helping police in the UK and Paris.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said the club were ‘appalled’ by the racial abuse, adding that owner Roman Abramovich was also ‘disgusted’.

Meanwhile, British Transport Police are seeking a gang of men, believed to be Chelsea fans, who were heard shouting racist chants at London St Pancras station on Wednesday evening. 

'Ashamed': Jose Mourinho said at a press conference that he was 'ashamed and disgusted' by the racism

Victim: Father-of-three Souleymane S was trying to get home when he was thrown off the train in Paris

A member of the public reported the men, who had travelled by train from Paris Gare du Nord, officers said. It is believed they were returning home after attending Chelsea's 1-1 draw with PSG.

Last week, millionaire comedian and self-styled anarchist Russell Brand, a West Ham fan, blamed the disgraced Chelsea fans’ racist thuggery in Paris on football’s recent £5billion TV rights deal.

However, he insisted he was not trying to excuse racism. Brand, 39, accused the Premier League of ‘garnering huge wealth and hogging it for itself’, rather than ‘sharing the bounty with fans’.

His comments sparked outrage among some blog followers. Responding to Brand, a Premier League spokesman said: ‘Regardless of ownership models, racist behaviour is not acceptable.'

The incident involved father-of-three Souleymane being pushed off a train as fans of the London club chanted racist remarks. The victim said it had left him 'hurt to the bottom of his heart'.

Rival football supporters posted a humorous video today of a black man being welcomed on board a train by a white man, telling Chelsea fans: ‘This is how we do it at West Ham.’

The clip sees a black man walk up to the train door, asking a white man: ‘Can I get on the train, sir?’ The white man then responds by saying: ‘This is West Ham my friend, on you come.’

The video was posted on Twitter by Arron Thomas today, and has since received more than 1,400 retweets. Hammers fan Russell Brand said: 'Comedy as a weapon against hate. Very funny.'

Mr Thomas said in the post at 10.45am: ‘Claret and blue is all that matters!’  West Ham fans were attending their side’s game at Tottenham Hotspur today, which finished 2-2.
