Tragedy: American journalist Charles Horman (pictured here with his wife Joyce) disappeared in Chile in 1973

Chile's Supreme Court has approved an 
extradition request for a former U.S. military officer who is wanted 
over the 1973 killings of two Americans - including one whose 
disappearance became the focus of an Oscar-winning film.

Former U.S. Navy captain Ray E. Davis is accused of being 'criminally responsible' for the deaths of journalist Charles Horman and student Frank Teruggi, who were killed during the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet.

Attorney, Sergio Corvalan, who represents Mr Horman's widow Joyce, said the Supreme Court has approved a request by Judge Jorge Zepeda to seek Capt Davis' extradition to face trial in Chile.

An unnamed court official said the vote would be formally announced today, according to the Associated Press (AP).

Capt Davis commanded the U.S. military 
mission in Chile at the time of the 1973 coup that ousted the
 democratically elected government of Marxist President Salvador 
Allende.

Mr Corvalan said the ruling by Chile's Supreme Court accuses Capt Davis of being 'criminally responsible as author of the 
crimes of qualified homicide of Charles Horman and Frank Teruggi.'

Mr Corvalan added that Supreme Court prosecutor Monica Maldonado said 'a
 homicide was committed' that could have been prevented by Capt Davis.

Capt Davis was investigating the two Americans 
as part of a series of covert intelligence operations by the U.S. 
Embassy in Santiago targeting those considered subversives or radicals, 
Corvalan said.

The Supreme Court considered the 
killings of the two Americans to be crimes against humanity, he added.

A conviction on the charges against Capt Davis carries a penalty of 10 
years to life in prison.

After he was charged a year 
ago his wife, Patricia Davis, is reported to have said her husband 
denied any involvement in the 
killings.

She said he no longer talked because of Alzheimer's disease 
and was in a nursing home.

Campaign: The search for Mr Horman by his wife, Joyce (pictured), and his father was the topic of the 1982 movie 'Missing,' which starred Sissy Spacek and Jack Lemmon in the roles

According to court papers, Mr Horman, a 
freelance journalist and filmmaker, was arrested on September 17, 1973, two 
weeks after the coup and taken to Santiago's main soccer stadium, which 
had been turned into a detention camp for General Pinochet's suspected enemies. 
He was 31 years old.

A national truth commission formed 
after the dictatorship ended said Mr Horman was executed the next day while
 in the custody of Chilean state security agents.

The commission said Mr Teruggi, then a 24-year-old university student, was executed on September 22.

The search for Mr Horman by his wife and 
his father was the topic of the 1982 movie 'Missing,' which starred 
Sissy Spacek and Jack Lemmon in the roles.

The film won a best 
screenplay Oscar.

'Missing' suggested U.S. complicity in 
Mr Horman's death and at the time drew strong objections from U.S. State 
Department officials.

The case was practically ignored 
in Chile until 2000, when Mrs Horman went to the country and filed a lawsuit
 against General Pinochet.

She said she was acting on behalf of all victims of 
the dictatorship.

The truth commission has determined that 3,095 people were murdered or 'disappeared' by government agents during General Pinochet's rule.
