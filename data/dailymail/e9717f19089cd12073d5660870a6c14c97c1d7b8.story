'At that age, playing should be the priority,' The former Madrid man told AS.

'It's really difficult in the big clubs among those that can be chosen.

'At 18, I decided to take a step back and sign for a club in the Segunda, but it was there that I got minutes and evolved as a player.

'It's a step that I'd advise all young players to take.'

Marcelo Brozovic watches Inter Milan take on Torino ahead of formally completing his move to the Serie A side.

Midfielder, who was linked with Liverpool, has signed a new four and a year deal.

Bolton goalkeeper Adam Bogdan produced a fabulous display at Anfield and his timing could barely have been better. 

Liverpool are one of the clubs monitoring Bogdan’s situation aware that he is out of contract at the end of the season and resisting Bolton’s efforts to re-sign.

'It was best for all concerned and at this stage all I wanted was to play for Real Madrid. I've been given a unique opportunity and I want to make the most of it.'

Gabriel Paulista waved a tearful goodbye to Villarreal fans on Saturday as he closes in on a £15million move to Arsenal. 

The Yellow Submarine confirmed on Twitter that a deal with the Gunners had been agreed on Saturday evening, shortly before their Primera Division match against Levante kicked off at El Madrigal.

And the 24-year-old said his final farewells to the La Liga side at the half-way point during the 1-0 win, and was visibly emotional as was presented with a yellow submarine as a farewell present.

That's according to Italian publication Tuttosport. Why, you ask?

The striker, who is still owned by Southamptonm is currently in excile at Inter Milan after clashing with team-mate Mauro Icardi.

Laurie Whitwell: Aston Villa defender Chris Herd is set to go on loan to Championship Wigan for the rest of the season.

Malky Mackay wants to add the Australian international to his squad and is close to completing a deal.

Herd, 25, a Villa academy graduate, has not played for Paul Lambert since December 2013 and his contract expires this summer.

He can play right-back, centre-back and in midfield, and spent a short spell on loan at Bolton earlier this season, playing three games.

Mackay is struggling at Wigan, winning only one of his 11 games in charge. They lost oat home to Huddersfield on Saturday and are 23rd in the Championship, five points from safety.

Juventus may currently enjoy a five-point advantage at the top of Serie A but they're already keen to further bolster their strikeforce for another title assault.

According to Sunday's edition of Tuttosport, Juve director general Giuseppe Marotta is weighing up a move for PSG's Edinson Cavani in the summer.

The Uruguayan has scored 15 goals in 28 matches this season so far and would certainly be an impressive addition to Juve's front line if they can stump up the cash.

Joel Campbell has revealed that he's looking forward to a 'new opportunity' after agreeing to join Villarreal on loan from Arsenal until the end of the season.

Despite being called back to the Arsenal squad after an impressive 2014 World Cup campaign with Costa Rica, Campbell has struggled to find a regular spot in Arsene Wenger's first team and has been used in the Frenchman's deal to bring Gabriel Paulista to the Emirates.

Speaking via his personal video blog, Campbell said: 'This means a lot to me, I am very excited with this new opportunity and I hope to sign the contract tomorrow [Sunday].

Palermo's president doesn't seem to rate soon-to-be Sampdoria striker Samuel Eto'o.

'I would never have signed Eto’o, as he is a has-been at the end of his career. His arrival is fitting with Ferrero’s day job, as it’s all about cinema and publicity.

He also called Paulo Dybala's suitors 'vultures'.

'We are very close to a contract renewal and it’s a matter of days, but the negotiations are being complicated by the vultures circling him.

'Due to this pressure, it will be difficult to keep hold of him at the end of the season. I don’t want to sell my best players, it is they who cannot say no when offered four or five times what they can earn here.

Could young PSG defender Marquinhos be off to Manchester United in the summer?

His agent is quoted as saying in La Parisien: 'Last summer, the president of PSG declared a transfer for Marquinhos nonnegotiable. 

We'll see what his position is next summer. Many clubs are interested. Manchester United is one of them, it's true.'

Villarreal have confirmed they have agreed a deal in principle with Arsenal for defender Gabriel Paulista to join the Gunners in a £15million deal.

The 24-year-old, who Arsene Wenger recently confirmed was a transfer target for the club, is expected to join the club imminently with Joel Campbell joining the La Liga side on loan for the remainder of the season as part of the agreement.
