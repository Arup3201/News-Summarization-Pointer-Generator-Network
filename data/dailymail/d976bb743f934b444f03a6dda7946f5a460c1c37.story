A mum jailed after the brutal death of her son at the hands of her drug addict boyfriend may soon walk free from prison after having her sentence slashed.

Kieron Barley died after Craig Lewis, 32, violently shook him and then threw his lifeless body against his cot railings in a fit of rage over a wet nappy.

Lewis was sentenced to eight years jail in April after admitting causing grievous bodily harm and manslaughter.

Kieron's mother, Louise Barley, 26, was jailed for 15 months for failing to seek medical attention for her son in the chaotic weeks leading up to his death.

Three Appeal Court judges yesterday reduced Barley's sentence by more than half to six months - making her eligible for immediate release.

Kieron, who was 22 months old when he died, suffered catastrophic brain injuries in the attack at the couple's home in Kings Heath, Birmingham, in June 2011.

Paramedics resuscitated Kieron on the floor of his home when he had a heart attack and stopped breathing but he suffered fatal brain damage and never regained consciousness.

The fatal assault happened just three weeks after the father of four had broken Kieron's spine in another attack. The following day Lewis left the family home to holiday at Center Parcs resort with his twin six-year-old girls from a previous relationship.

Doctors had failed to notice the spinal injuries and Kieron spent the last few weeks of his life in agony as his parents began spinning a 'web of lies' to cover their tracks.

Lawyers for Barley told the appeal judges that Lewis had always seemed calm and caring in her son's company.

Police said Lewis and Barley 'spun a web of lies' after Kieron's death, repeatedly claiming their innocence

They agreed she had no idea that Lewis had inflicted such serious injuries on Kieron, ruling her 'culpability' lay in 'not ensuring that Kieron had medical attention'.

The court heard that Barley had not taken Kieron to hospital in the first few weeks of June and had failed to give her health visitor a full account during a visit on June 9.

Upholding Barley's challenge, the appeal judges said: 'To our mind her offending didn't cause Kieron's death or his serious injury before death. No harm was occasioned by her.'

The sentence reduction means Barley is now eligible for release, something Keiron's aunty Lesley Edwards has 'mixed feelings' about.

She lays most of the blame for her nephew's death on Lewis and said: 'If somebody told me that he had won some kind of appeal then I would certainly have something to say about it. But I do intend to try and speak to her when she comes out.'

After the court case it emerged that Birmingham Children's Hospital had failed to detect Kieron's spinal and head injuries from the first attack.

The role of the hospital, and other agencies, is at the centre of a serious case review which will report later this year.
