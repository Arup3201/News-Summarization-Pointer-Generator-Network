Sam and Billie Faiers' stepfather has been arrested over his alleged involvement in a £1million gold bullion heist.

David Chatwood, 57, was arrested at the home he shares with The Only Way Is Essex stars and their mother Sue Wells, 42, in Brentwood, Essex.

He and five men were in jail last night in the UK, accused of an international conspiracy to snatch gold bars in Belgium.

Nearly £1million worth of gold and silver was reportedly stolen from a lorry in Antwerp 
on October 19. It belonged to a precious metal company and was 
being transported to the UK.

Chatwood has been charged with conspiracy to
steal and transfer criminal property and appeared at Barking Magistrates' Court last week.

He was remanded in 
custody until January. It is unclear what his plea will be.

Chatwood has been the reality stars' mother's boyfriend for several years and they reportedly see him as a father figure.

Their real father, Lee Faiers was convicted of assaulting his partner Fay Simmons in June.

He was given a community service order and told to attend a domestic violence programme.

The latest arrest has reportedly stunned The Only Way Is Essex stars Billie, 21, and Sam, 20. Sam tweeted this morning: 'Just when u think things can't get worse !! :-( .... 'be strong' x x'

The sisters are still recovering from a horrifying attack by a girl gang last weekend.

Sam was rushed to hospital and required a brain scan following the unprovoked attack.

Despite their troubles, the girls smiled as they took their mother and a friend out for dinner last night and posed for photos.

Earlier in the day, they were spotted leaving their home, looking in good spirits.

Their mother said this week that she wished her daughters had never joined the ITV show because of the attack from the girl gang.
