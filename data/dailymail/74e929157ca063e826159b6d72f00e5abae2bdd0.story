Labour failed to appreciate the UK jobs market would prove a magnet for Polish plumbers, one of Tony Blair’s most senior advisers admitted yesterday.

The admission was one of a series of revelations about how the last Government chronically mishandled Eastern European immigration.

One ex-Cabinet minister said he had warned the influx was having a huge impact on hospitals and wages - but was largely ignored by his colleagues.

Sir Stephen Wall, who was Mr Blair’s most senior EU adviser between 2000 and 2004, said Labour failed to foresee the attraction Britain would pose to Polish workers on low wages in their home country

In advance of Poland and seven other Eastern Bloc nations joining the EU in 2004, ministers relied upon advice suggesting only 13,000 would settle each year.

In the end, more than one million travelled – with at least half that number settling in what is one of the biggest waves of immigration in British history.

They were attracted by wages which are significantly higher than back home.

Sir Stephen Wall, who was Mr Blair’s most senior EU adviser between 2000 and 2004, said: ‘We simply didn’t take account properly of the pull factor of England for people with skills who could probably find a bigger market [in the UK] for their skills - you know, the Polish plumber.’

In comments which will pose a huge headache for Ed Miliband, Sir Stephen also admitted the decision to throw open Britain’s borders at a time when other countries were imposing transitional controls was ‘political’.

The remarks risk re-igniting the debate about Labour’s record – for which the Labour leader recently apologised.

Sir Stephen said: ‘The primary argument was the political one – this was the right thing to do, we attached a lot of importance to them as democratic countries and keeping our position as the number one friend of eastern and central Europeans.’

Last night, Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of the Migration Watch campaign group, told the Mail: ‘It is astonishing that nobody properly considered the impact of the wage differential between Britain and a huge country like Poland.

‘We said at the time the forecast of 13,000-a-year was almost worthless. In fact, it was completely worthless.’

Yesterday, it also emerged that ex-Labour Cabinet minister John Denham had written to Chancellor Gordon Brown and Home Secretary Charles Clarke to warn the new arrivals were having a huge impact.

He said the Government failed to recognise what was happening in constituencies like his own in Southampton, where wages were driven down by as much as 50 per cent, A&E departments came under strain and 1,000 migrants attempted to sign up for an English-as-a-second language course in a single day.

Mr Denham added: ‘The whole irony of this is that in some respects Tony Blair was obsessed by immigration, particularly about illegal immigration and abuse of the asylum system, but on EU migration there was a catastrophic failure of the civil service machine.’

In further bombshell remarks, the respected economist Paul Ormerod, writing in the Left-wing Guardian newspaper, exploded Labour’s economic case for mass migration.

He argued that, at best, it had a ‘barely perceptible’ impact on economic growth per head while supressing the wages of the less well-off.

Mr Ormerod said: ‘New Labour allowed direct competition to enter the UK labour market on a scale unprecedented in our history…It is the relatively unskilled in the bottom half of the distribution who have lost out.

Former Home Secretary David Blunkett (pictured) has defended Labour's record on mass migration, saying he is 'confident' it was the right policy, 'even though very few people now will stand up for it'

‘The liberal elite do not suffer. Indeed, they benefit because many of the services they consume are provided at lower prices than would have been the case without mass immigration.’

His comments were echoed by ex-Labour Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, who said: ‘The person that benefits from…growth is often not the one worried that their kid is going to get less attention from the teacher in the class room because there are people speaking Polish.’

But two more Home Secretaries from the New Labour years were unrepentant about the party’s record, despite the fact Ed Miliband has since apologised for how it handled the influx.

Charles Clarke, who was sacked over the foreign prisoner scandal in 2006, said: ‘It’s nonsense to suggest it has terrible impact on public services – most of the people coming here were working, didn’t have children, and were not of age to be a big burden on NHS.’

David Blunkett said: ‘I’m confident that it was the right decision, even though very few people now will stand up for it. I just think that allowing people to move [to the UK] but not to work would have been a complete own goal.’
