Poppy Rose Cleere, Online Marketing & Social Media Planner at HMV, was behind the tweets

Its demise has been widely blamed on online shopping.

And yesterday the internet caused further problems for struggling HMV – when staff hijacked the firm’s Twitter account to post a blow-by-blow account of mass sackings at head office.

Angry staff gave live updates of the ‘mass execution’ at the beleaguered music firm’s London headquarters.

Around 190 workers both there and across its distribution centres were fired.

The incident triggered panic among HMV
executives who were seen marching around the office pleading for advice
on how to delete the tweets and shut down the @hmvtweets feed.

The first read: ‘We’re tweeting live 
from inside HR where we’re all being fired! Exciting!!’ One minute later
came the update: ‘There are over 60 of us being fired at once! Mass 
execution of loyal employees who love the brand.’

Another followed: 
‘Just overheard our marketing director (he’s staying folks) ask “How do I
shut down twitter?”.’

One message, spread over two posts, 
read: ‘Under usual circumstances, we’d never dare do such a thing as 
this.

However, when the company you dearly love is being ruined and 
those hard working individuals, who wanted to make HMV great again, have
mostly been fired, there seemed no other choice.’

The company managed to delete the tweets by mid-afternoon, however not before they had been re-tweeted thousands of times.

'Execution': The tweets from HMV's official account slammed the firing of 60 employees in one meeting

Poppy Rose Cleere, who described 
herself as HMV’s social media planner, said last night she was behind 
the tweets.

The 21-year-old said senior managers ‘never seemed to grasp’
the importance of social media.

‘I hope they’re finally listening,’ 
she said in a message from her personal account.

‘Since my internship 
started, I worked tirelessly to educate the business of the importance 
of social media – not as a short-term commercial tool, but as a tool to 
build and strengthen the customer relationship, and to gain invaluable 
real-time feedback from the consumers that have kept us going for over 
91 years.’

Final stand: The rebellious tweets went on to say the firm was being 'ruined' so they had no other choice

HMV later deleted all its tweets then added these two tweets later, saying there have been job losses but 'not in our stores'

Cuts: Administrators Deloitte said today that they hoped the brand had a future as a 'restructured business'

Just looking: Supportive Twitter users praised the courage of the rogue member of staff

It was not known last night if she was one of those being sacked.

Staff at HMV, which employs more than 
4,000 people, have been afraid for their future since the chain went 
into administration two weeks ago.

HMV announced the job cuts that sparked the Twitter revolution this afternoon.

The
anonymous user posting messages from the company's official account 
claimed to be at an HR meeting in which 60 members of staff were being 
let go.

Staff were today made redundant at the following locations:

There are hopes that many of the 239 
shops and their staff can be saved through a sale of the business to 
Hilco, which specialises in rescuing failed brands.

Hilco has already purchased HMV’s bank debts, while it is now negotiating to take over the stores.

Its efforts are understood to have the support of a group of music labels and film studios, including Universal Music and Sony.

The industry believes it is vital to 
keep a national chain of entertainment shops on the High Street to 
provide competition to web retailers, such as Amazon, and the big 
supermarkets.

Accountants Deloitte have been appointed as administrators
and are overseeing the negotiations and the staff dismissals.

It said there have been just over 100 
redundancies at head office locations in London, Marlow and Birmingham 
and around 85 across the distribution network.

Joint administrator Nick Edwards said 
of the redundancies: ‘Although such decisions are always difficult, it 
is a necessary step in restructuring the business to enhance the 
prospects of securing its future.’
