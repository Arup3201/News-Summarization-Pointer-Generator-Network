A teenage cycling fanatic has been forced to apologise to the winner of Dublin’s Giro d’Italia stage – after taking a selfie with him on the ground.

David McCarthy, 19, became a figure of hate on social media for taking a picture with cyclist Marcel Kittel while the star was sitting on the roadside exhausted and gasping for breath.

He was bombarded with abuse on social media after posting the picture on his Instagram account, with the caption: 'Kittel collapsed after the line today so instead of giving him a hand up I took a selfie'.

Moments earlier, Kittel had sprinted to a
 stage win in front of 50,000 people on Merrion Square to complete the 
Armagh to Dublin leg of the race.

The photograph drew a barrage of criticism towards Mr McCarthy, with cycling websites and members of the cycling community condemning his behaviour.

The teenager said: ‘Within five minutes people were calling me a w*****, calling me a loser.’

It is believed many of those who saw the picture were under the mistaken impression that Mr McCarthy had posed in front of Kittel following a crash.

Mr McCarthy, from Fermoy, County Cork, said he just got swept up in the moment.

‘I didn’t mean it in a bad way,’ he said.

‘I was standing on a post box 100metres behind the line, I hopped off it and there was Kittel beside me.

He added: ‘There were a load of photographers around so I thought “he won’t mind one more camera being there” so I just went down and literally I was down there and out in two seconds.’

Within minutes of posting the picture to his Instagram account, Mr McCarthy faced a barrage of criticism.

‘Last night I turned off my phone when I went to bed because the amount of abuse I was getting,‘ he said, adding that some of the comments really hurt him.

‘I had put it up on Instagram and was getting awful abuse on it. I was reading through the comments and it was getting worse and worse so I just said, I don’t need this negative energy coming at me”, so I just deleted it. I hope now it will just pass on.’

He has since removed the picture from his social media accounts.

Mr McCarthy said that so far as he knew, Kittel wasn’t offended by his behaviour:

‘One of his teammates messaged me and said that Kittel will see the funny side of it. He didn’t really care and he wasn’t too bothered about it.’

Mr McCarthy issued an apology to Kittel and all the people he offended yesterday in which he said he did not think the photo would cause such hatred towards him.

Apology: A message which McCarthy sent to Irish cyclist and pal Nicholas Roche, which was posted on Twitter and retweed by Kittel

‘I got excited after the finish to see Marcel and wanted a photo and in hindsight looking back I understand the time and place was completely wrong,’ the apology read.

The apology was tweeted by Irish cyclist Nicholas Roche to his 70,000 followers and drew a humorous response from Marcel Kittel who tweeted McCarthy, telling him that he had learned his lesson.

‘So did I when my Grandma found me playing with fireworks next to our barn full with dry hay,’ the German sports star wrote.

Roche also stood up for the teenager, telling his Twitter followers that ‘Dave is a nice kid’.

McCarthy knows Roche through an Irish youth development cycling team that Roche mentors.

Mr McCarthy hopes one day to turn professional himself and said since Roche defended him the abuse has lessened.

‘Nico is really nice, he is an idol for me and would be my role model. I was really upset with the whole thing and I just messaged him and I said I was really sorry about it and he gave me advice on what to do. I wrote the message and he tweeted it and once it went out people started changing their tune when people saw that I was sorry.’

Yesterday, Kittel’s Team Giant-Shimano confirmed that the German rider – who also won a stage in the North – will not compete in the rest of the Giro because of a ‘fever.’
