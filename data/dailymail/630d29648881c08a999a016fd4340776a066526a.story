Network Rail was today accused of 
'corporate blindness' after being fined £1million for breaching health 
and safety laws at a level crossing where two teenage girls were killed.

Olivia Bazlinton, 14, and Charlotte 
Thompson, 13, were hit by a train in 2005 as they crossed the tracks at 
Elsenham station footpath crossing in Essex.

Judge David Turner QC, sentencing at Chelmsford Crown Court, ordered Network Rail to pay the large fine and £60,000 costs.

He said: 'I have concluded that there 
was a clear history of inadequate risk assessment and a failure to heed 
and act upon relevant information.

'There was a consistent failure to 
take timely remedial action - a consistent underplaying that this 
crossing was being regularly misused.

'Warnings went unheeded, data insufficiently appraised and critical questions went unasked and unanswered.

'Remedial action was unsatisfactorily delayed.'

He added: 'Narrow thinking, culpable 
corporate blindness and a complacency going beyond merely inefficient 
incompetency to entering the realm of criminal failure.'

Chelmsford Crown Court heard that 
Olivia and Charlotte were killed on December 3, 2005, as they crossed a 
footpath leading to Elsenham station platform.

The court was told that the pair 
'seemed happy' and were chatting and holding hands moments before their 
deaths. The crossing was fitted with warning lights and alarms.

A London-to-Cambridge train passed 
over the crossing with the red lights and yodel sounding - a warning for
foot passengers not to cross.

After the train passed, the lights 
remained on and the alarms continued to sound as another train, 
travelling from Birmingham to Stansted Airport in Essex, was going to 
pass through the station.

The girls opened the unlocked wicket 
gates and walked on to the crossing. They were both struck by the 
Stansted train and killed.

The court heard that a safety official
had raised concerns about the possibility of tragedy in a memorandum in
2001 but the document was not disclosed by Network Rail until last 
year.

Judge Turner said Network Rail had a 
'solemn responsibility' for the safety of members of the public, adding:
'The company concedes that the procedures or standards in place for 
conducting level crossing risk assessments before 2005 were deficient.

'The company unreservedly apologises for its failures which contributed to the deaths of these young girls.

'Network Rail, in part by itself and 
in part through its predecessor Railtrack, failed to ensure that the 
risks were properly assessed, controlled or managed.'

Olivia's mother, Tina Hughes, who 
clutched an old teddy bear throughout the proceedings, had tears in her 
eyes when she said: 'I didn't really want to come to court.

'I wanted to go to parents' evening 
and hear the teachers say that Olivia talked too much in class, and sit 
in the seat when she took her driving test and cling to it, and see her 
bring a bag of washing home from uni, and watch her walk down the aisle 
looking like an angel, and look into the eyes of her newborn babies.'

She said that if disclosure of key safety documents had come sooner then teenager Katie Littlewood still be alive.

The 15-year-old was hit by a train in January at Johnson's Footpath Crossing in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire.

Her death happened just a few miles down the track from where Olivia and Charlotte were killed six years ago.

Ms Hughes said had the documents been 
disclosed in time for the inquest of her daughter and Charlotte in 2007,
then key safety changes which Network Rail is rolling out would have 
already been implemented and Katie would not have been killed.

'Had it been done before then Katie would not have died on that crossing and that absolutely breaks my heart,' she added.

Olivia's father, Chris Bazlinton, 
said: 'Everybody says 'Has justice been done?' Justice can't be done 
after you have lost your daughter.

'The process of justice has been done and they have been fined £1million - it is nothing more than symbolic.'

Charlotte's mother, Hilary Thompson, said: 'They took our daughters from us and they broke our hearts.'

Charlotte's father, Reg Thompson, 
added: 'I do believe because of what has been done, because of what 
Chris and Tina have done, that Charlie and Liv at least have meant that 
the railways will be safer.

'What Network Rail have promised to do
today in court, which is to spend £130million on improving safety on 
level crossings, and the changes that they have already made, have come 
about because of the terrible thing that happened to our daughters.'
