They may have suffered their worst season in Premier League history but Manchester United have rocketed into second place in a list of the world's wealthiest football clubs.

Despite a campaign of turmoil, which saw David Moyes sacked as they struggled to adapt to life without Sir Alex Ferguson and finished seventh, United are behind only Real Madrid in the Deloitte's Football Money League.

The Old Trafford outfit leapfrogged European superpowers Bayern Munich and Barcelona after their revenues rose from to £433.2m from £363.2m.

Champions League winners Real Madrid are the wealthiest club in the world 

Across town, Premier League champions Manchester City remain the second-richest English club, in sixth place globally behind Paris Saint Germain.

League leaders Chelsea remain in seventh, ahead of Arsenal in eighth. Liverpool, no doubt buouyed by last season's ultimately unsuccessful title tilt, rise from 12th place to ninth overtaking Juventus, Borussia Dortmund and AC Milan.

United's rise is down to its rapid commercial growth, and with more deals announced this year they are expected to go from strength to strength despite the debt that remains from the 2005 Glazer takeover.

In the 18th edition of the report, which uses figures sourced directly from each club and is put together by Manchester-based Deloitte’s Sports Business Group, City recorded the largest increase of any outfit in the top five - news Etihad bosses may see as a vindication of their methods.

Things weren't going well for David Moyes and United on the pitch but the opposite was true off it

The Premier League champions saw revenues rise from £271m to £346.5m a 28% increase.

Thanks largely to the new broadcasting deals struck by the Premier League Newcastle United (19) and Everton (20) break into the top 20 for the first time.

Spurs go up a place from 14th to 13th. In total English clubs make up five of the top 10 and eight of the top 20 – more than any other country.

Dan Jones, partner at Deloitte’s Sports Business Group, said: “It was a very successful year for the North West clubs. No other region in the world has as many clubs in the top 20 and these clubs play a major role in the North West economy.

'Last year Premier League clubs benefitted from much larger broadcast revenues thanks to the latest round of deals. The Premier League is currently undertaking its next round of sales of broadcast rights and with the market expectation that another significant increase will occur, it is likely that the Money League will have a strongly English appearance in the coming years.'
