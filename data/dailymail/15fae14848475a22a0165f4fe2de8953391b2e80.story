Restaurant chain Nando’s have become the latest company to end their relationship with Oldham over the impending signing of Ched Evans.

Convicted rapist Evans looks set to return to football with the League One club and could sign a two-and-half-year deal as early as Thursday.

Oldham owner and chairman Simon Corney said: ‘There is an 80 per cent chance of us signing him. It’s not straightforward and there are some legal issues. We believe he has served his time.’

Oldham Athletic's deal to sign Ched Evans is at an advanced stage and is set to be announced on Thursday

Speaking exclusively to The Jewish Chronicle, Corney added: ‘There might be a cost implication, but you have to stick to your principles. We weren’t surprised by the backlash.’

However, Nando’s - who had been involved with promotions at Oldham – tweeted: ‘RE Oldham signing: we’d have liked to continue our involvement with fan prizes at matches but feel we can no longer continue our association.’

Nando’s announcement came after Verlin Rainwater Solutions cut their ties with the club, which included sponsoring a stand at Boundary Park.

Company director Craig Verlin said: ‘It is with great regret that Verlin Rainwater Solutions will no longer be associated with Oldham Athletic.

‘We feel Mr Evans should be able to lead a life without further punishment after serving his sentence, although our feelings remain that this should not be within the public domain where his previous behaviour may influence the next generation.

‘We sincerely wish the club a very successful future but feel our continued support would be sending out the wrong message.’

Another Oldham sponsor, ZenOffice, warned it would sever its five-year relationship with the club if the signing went ahead.

A statement from the company said: ‘This partnership has been based on mutual respect based on family and community. ZenOffice do not agree that the current path OAFC are embarking on espouses these values. Therefore it is with much regret that we confirm we will end our association with Oldham Athletic if the move goes ahead to sign Ched Evans.’
