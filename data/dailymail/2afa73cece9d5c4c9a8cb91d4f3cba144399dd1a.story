Police have launched an investigation after the body of a newborn baby was found at a waste management plant in Bradford last night.

Detectives have urged the mother of the child to come forward amid concerns for her health after the boy was found at the Associated Waste Management plant in Shipley, West Yorkshire.

A post mortem is to take place later today to establish how the baby died, but officers believe that the child had been born 'very recently'.

It is the second time that a baby's body has been found at the site in two years.

Detective Superintendent Mark Ridley, from West Yorkshire Police's Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'My priority is the condition and welfare of the mother and ensuring she receives the medical care she needs.

'The mother has clearly been through a terribly traumatic experience and I would ask her to come forward and speak to us.'

The site processes material from homes in Leeds and Bradford and police are trying to determine if the baby's mother is from the West Yorkshire area.

It is the second time in a little over two years that a baby's body has been found at the waste management site.

In May 2011, the body of a baby girl was found in bin liners by a member of staff there.

The baby remained unidentified and local residents rallied round to give the child - who they named Catherine - a funeral.

Baby Catherine's remains had been discovered on the final conveyor belt of the lengthy sorting and filtering process.

Staff
from the site helped to fund the funeral and members of the Sandale 
Community Centre organised the service and collected money for a floral 
tribute. More than 100 people attended.

Anyone with information is asked to contact West Yorkshire Police or call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
