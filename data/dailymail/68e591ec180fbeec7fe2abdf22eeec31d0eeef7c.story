The Premier League's love affair with Ed Sheeran shows no sign of abating after Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney was caught duetting with the singer-songwriter. 

Sheeran was seen riffing with the England captain at an after-party following a gig in Manchester - one which Robin van Persie also rocked up to. 

Rooney was sat on stage in a nearby pub alongside the 23-year-old, head wobbling as he tried to keep pace with Lego House in front of a roomful of revellers at the Sir Ralph Abercromby pub near Deansgate.

Onlookers can be heard urging on the frontman as he sang with Sheeran following a 15,000 sell-out gig. 

The phenomenon surrounding Sheeran has taken on a mind of its own in the past fortnight. Mark Clattenburg was dropped from the top-flight's list of officials at the weekend after breaking protocol and travelling to a concert in Newcastle days before.

The referee drove alone to take charge of West Brom's home game against Crystal Palace on October 25 - a move engineered in order to see the award winner perform at the Metro Radio Arena. 

Arsenal defender Calum Chambers has also seen Sheeran perform recently.

But Rooney - who made no secret of the fact he'd kept company with the star last week - took it one step further, entertaining those around him with his rendition.

One punter told The Sun: 'Everyone was singing along and laughing but he showed he can take a joke.

'It was like a normal group of mates messing about in a pub but I'd definitely advise him not give up the day job.'

Wayne Rooney isn't the only Premier League star who has been showing off his musical talent over the past few days.

Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech posted a video to his YouTube account playing along to the Foo Fighters song 'Walk'.

Cech has previously performed at a music festival in the Czech Republic, and says he has considered a career as a musician once he hangs up his gloves. 

Pub landlord Mike Christodoulou said: 'Ed pulled out his guitar and him and Wayne had a little sing-song — it was good vibes all round.'

Rooney missed three games through suspension but returned as United lost 1-0 to derby rivals City. 

Sunday’s defeat left Louis van Gaal’s side in 10th place in the table after their worst start to a season since 1986.

This was far from being Rooney's first gig, having been filmed doing karaoke in the past. In 2011 he did a seven-song set while on holiday with his wife and children in Barbados.

He belted out Queen hit We Are The Champions and Yesterday by The Beatles after asking people for requests.

He later tweeted: 'Having a great night in Barbados! In lexys piano bar with ColeenRoo and friends. Been on the mic for about 7 songs and felt like a rock star'.

Rooney, who celebrated his birthday days, had remained in Manchester while wife Coleen and their two sons, Kai, two, and 17-month old Klay, enjoyed a half-term break in Barbados.
