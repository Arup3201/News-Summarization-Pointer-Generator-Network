Her mother is perhaps one the world’s most iconic supermodels, with shoots for big names such as Vogue, Escada and Maybelline under her belt.

So it’s hardly surprising that Cindy Crawford’s doppelganger daughter, Kaia Gerber, is keen to follow in her mother's glamorous footsteps.

The 13-year-old has already lent her good looks to Versace and she's getting set to star in the glossy pages of Teen Vogue - a major fashion coup for such a fledgling model.

The next generation? Cindy Crawford's 13-year-old daughter Kaia is a model in this month's Teen Vogue

Speaking about her daughter's foray into fashion, Cindy told the Evening Standard: 'I’m happy for her to be happy. 

'She’s kind of chomping at the bit and the Teen Vogue piece seemed like an appropriate thing to do. 

'I am very comfortable with the photographer, who is a woman I’ve worked with a lot and is a mother herself.' 

Cindy, who is one of the world's most iconic supermodels, has vowed to help her daughter ‘navigate’ the fashion industry and keep her grounded.

She added: 'She’s still only 13 and too young to know what she wants to do. I think even doing this photoshoot, while it was fun,  she realises it’s not only fun - it’s a job.

'It’s not just about sitting there having hair and make-up done and putting pretty dresses on.' 

Spitting image? Cindy Crawford's doppelganger daughter Kaia Gerber doesn't think she shares any resemblance to her famous mother but is already following in her fashionable footsteps

Kaia is unmistakably the spitting image of her mother, thanks to their similar fine bone structure, caramel coloured hair and thick, arched eyebrows.

However, the aspiring teenage model is the first to dismiss the uncanny likeness.

Kaia, whose father Rande Gerber has been married to Cindy for 16 years, said she doesn't see the close similarities with her mother.

Doppelganger: Cindy, 48, recently took to her social media sites to post a shot of herself back in her heyday along with one of Kaia

Cindy, 48, recently took to her social media sites to post a shot of herself back in her modelling heyday along with one image of her daughter.

She simply captioned the image: '@kaiajordan I want my old hair back! #teenvogue' 

Kaia grew up surrounded by her mother's pals, including Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington and Linda Evangelista, but says she just thought of them as ‘really pretty'.

Despite aspiring to become a top model, Kaia doesn't think she is very fashionable.

‘I'm not super-glam,’ she told Teen Vogue. ‘I wear jeans and a T-shirt most of the time.’ 

Ageing gracefully! The similarity between mother and daughter is uncanny depite the age differences
