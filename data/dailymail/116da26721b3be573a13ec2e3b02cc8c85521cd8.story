Michael Clarke hit a supreme 74 as the departing Australian captain led his country to World Cup glory against New Zealand with a seven-wicket victory in Melbourne on Sunday.

A crowd of 93,013 witnessed Australia claim their fifth world title as a match that promised so much ended up being incredibly one-sided.

New Zealand were always looking for a miracle after being bowled out for a below-par 183 in 45 overs, despite 83 from Grant Elliott – as Mitchell Starc bowled Brendon McCullum for a duck in the first over.

In response, Clarke and Steve Smith shared a 112-run third-wicket partnership as Australia cruised to victory in 34 overs.

McCullum called right at the toss and on a sun-bathed Melbourne Cricket Ground the New Zealand captain understandably chose to bat.

So often the 33-year-old’s own innings sets the tempo of the Black Caps innings and on Sunday it was no different.

Having come out swinging and twice been beaten, McCullum was bowled for a duck by a full, in-swinging Starc delivery that cannoned into off-stump.

It sent the MCG crowd into a fit of delirium as a wicket fell in the first over in a World Cup final for the first time ever.

Aggressive starts to matches with the bat has seen New Zealand boast an average run-rate of 7.70 in first 10 overs of their innings during this tournament but Australia’s early stranglehold on their opposition saw them make just 31 for one.

Clarke’s inspired bowling change provided the next breakthrough as the impressive Glenn Maxwell bowled Martin Guptill (15) with just his second ball.

And six balls later New Zealand were reduced to 39 for three as Kane Williamson departed for 12 having attempted to block the explosive Johnson but only succeeded in sending the ball straight back to the bowler.

It was the perfect start for Australia and Clarke remained on the attack with two new New Zealand batsman at the crease.

But Ross Taylor and semi-final hero Elliott steadied the ship and slowly began to rebuild, with the latter top-edging Starc for a 72-meter six into the leg side.

The pair shared a 111-run fourth-wicket partnership and looked to have brought New Zealand back into the match only for the batting powerplay to spark a dramatic collapse.

James Faulkner, who is quickly becoming one of the best powerplay and death bowlers, was brought back into the attack and immediately had Taylor caught behind for 40.

The 24-year-old Tasmanian deceived the batsman with a slower ball and Brad Haddin took an exceptional low catch, diving to his right, with the ball dying on him.

Two balls later the heavy-hitting Corey Anderson was sent back to the pavilion having failed to score as he was beaten for pace as the ball came back off his pads and shattered the stumps.

A double-wicket maiden in a World Cup is impressive, a double-wicket maiden in a powerplay to induce a collapse is sensational and looked to be the potential match-winning moment.

Five out quickly became six as wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi’s time at the crease lasted just six minutes as he edged Starc to Michael Clarke at first slip for a four-ball duck – the first two overs of the powerplay accounting for three wickets and just a single run.

Meanwhile, Elliott – fresh from his semi-final match-winning unbeaten 84 - continued to time the ball sweetly as all those around him played as if they had never picked up a bat before.

And, whereas Clarke’s one-day international swansong was going to plan Daniel Vettori could only muster nine before a full in-swinging yorker from Johnson hit the 36-year-old’s pad and rattled onto the stumps.

New Zealand were crumbling and Elliott having effortlessly moved to 83 became Faulkner’s third victim of the afternoon as he mistimed his shot and an outside edge was gleefully taken by Haddin.

When needed most, the Black Caps tail failed to wag and the final wicket run-out perfectly summed up both side’s days up to that point.

Boult defended a short Johnson ball to Maxwell at short leg and in a single move the allrounder picked up the ball and hit the non-striker’s stumps.

Tim Southee’s bat stuck in the ground and he was run-out, as New Zealand stumbled to 183 all out.

It was telling that Australia leaked just 12 fours and three sixes against such a fierce and deep batting line-up and added further proof of their remarkable day in the field.

Early wickets were going to be vital if New Zealand were going to make their first World Cup final they have featured in competitive and their best bowler, Boult, delivered.

Aaron Finch attempting to push a fuller ball off his legs only succeeded in hitting the ball into his pads, up into the air and into the waiting Boult’s hands.

The Kiwi fans, silent for large parts of the first innings, were now making themselves heard but David Warner soon quieted them once again.

Warner found the boundary seven times in his 45 off 46-balls before Matt Henry claimed his first wicket of the World Cup having batsman caught at deep square leg, attempting to pull the ball.

The loss of the second Australian wicket put McCullum back into an aggressive mindset and Clarke was welcomed to the field with seven catchers and only one man outside the 30-yard circle.

But the right-handed batsman was equal to the task and having passed fifty he smacked Southee for four successive fours before chopping on a slower ball from Henry, having made 74 off 72-balls.

And, Smith (56 not out) hit his fifth consecutive half-century as the MCG erupted in jubilation as the celebrations begun.

It was a disappointing end for New Zealand who had been brilliant with the bat and ball and in the field throughout the World Cup.

But the day and night belonged to the Australians who once again were crowned as the best one-day team in the world.
