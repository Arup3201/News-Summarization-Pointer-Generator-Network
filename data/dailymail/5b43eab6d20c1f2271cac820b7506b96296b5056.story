Scored a deal: Dunkin' Donuts is the latest in a long list of endorsement deals that Lebron James has inked

Executives at Dunkin Donuts are hoping to make China run on Dunkin’ and using Lebron James to help by signing an endorsement deal with the basketball star.

Dunkin' Brands Inc. said Monday that NBA superstar Lebron James has agreed to promote Dunkin' Donuts and Baskin-Robbins ice cream in Asia where the company has about a third of its stores.

The company is hoping to cater to the eastern market by creating different savory products for the various countries.

One example of a locally-inspired menu item would be pork donuts in China, and though they may not be palatable to Americans or Europeans, it will certainly show the company's understanding of the nation's preferences, where it aims to open another 100 stores in the next two to three years.

James will promote Dunkin's brands in China, Taiwan, India and South Korea through advertisements, online media and in-store marketing, so he may well be testing out the new pork donuts while on promotional visits.

'Donuts are a very flexible product. You can do savory donuts, you can do donuts with shredded pork -- that's in China,' said CEO Nigel Travis.

'We also have a range of other savory products that we have been testing and introducing country by country.'

Getting the menu right in each market is critical. Pork donuts, for example, are not likely to sell well in Indonesia and Malaysia, where people are predominantly Muslim.

James will also make personal 
appearances in Asia after the season ends in June, which is sure to 
increase profits for the company as the 27-year-old is very popular in 
the region.

International appeal: At present, a third of the company's stores are in Asia- like this store in Shanghai- and they are due to add 250 more in the next 2-3 years

Dunkin' 
executive John Costello would not elaborate on the specific terms of the
 deal, but said it was multiyear and worth multimillions of dollars.

‘I'm
 really excited about partnering with Dunkin' Brands and connecting with
 the huge community of basketball fans’ in Asia, James said in a 
statement.

James, a two-time
 NBA Most Valuable Player, has the best-selling basketball jersey and 
shoe in China and has visited Asia four times.

This endorsement deal comes on top of a number of others that help James earn between $25million and $30million per year.

Open for business: Seen here at a charity event sponsored by Sprite- with whom James has an endorsement deal- the NBA star makes anywhere between $25m-$30m per year

Brand ambassador: James has long had a contract with Nike, and has nine signature shoes by the company

Fast
 food has been profitable for the player in the past, as he has a 
long-term contract with McDonalds already underway, as well as other 
food and drink deals with Sprite, Glacéau and Bubblicious.

There are over 10,000 Dunkin' Donuts shops worldwide in 32 countries. This figure puts them in the same league- though still vastly outnumbered- as Starbucks which has 17,009 locations.

The brand's headquarters are in Canton, Massachusetts, and unsurprisingly the chain is seen most frequently in the Northeast of the United States.

In the home state alone there are 294 locations.

Moving west of the Mississippi River, however, there are only 75 franchises.

That number is sure to increase in the coming years as the company announced that it plans to triple its total size. A large amount of those locations are going to come in the U.S. as it plans to have 15,000 stores by 2020.

They also plan to expand outside of the U.S., with expected openings in the Ukraine, India, Brazil and Costa Rica.

But given their endorsement plans with Lebron James, it comes as no surprise that much of their attention will be focused on Asia.

The company plans to open 250 stores throughout the continent in the next two to three years, 100 of which will be in China.

China
 is the NBA's second-biggest market after the U.S., and NBA players 
often visit Asia on behalf of shoe companies or other sponsors during 
the offseason.

Dunkin' is hoping James' popularity 
will help boost sales in a region where it has about 5,400 stores, or 
about a third of its global total.

The company plans to add at least 250
 stores in Asia during the next two to three years- 100 of which are 
expected to be in China, chief executive Nigel Travis said.

Dunkin' opened its first restaurant in
 Vietnam in December and plans to open its inaugural store in India 
later this year, Mr Travis said. South Korea has the most Dunkin' stores
 in Asia with about 1,900 while Japan has 1,087 - all Baskin-Robbins.

The James deal ‘is Asia focused and reflects our commitment to Asia,’ Mr Travis told reporters in Singapore.

‘Lebron has a strong commitment to 
building his relationship in Asia so he's definitely planning multiple 
trips to Asia in the offseason this year.’

The popularity of basketball in Asia 
has grown during the last decade, in part because of former Houston 
Rockets center Yao Ming of China, who retired last year.

New
 York Knicks guard Jeremy Lin has become an overnight sensation in Asia,
 especially in China and Taiwan. Lin, whose parents were born in Taiwan,
 is the first Asia-American player in the NBA.

Mr Costello said Dunkin is happy to have snagged James, who has been an All-Star for eight seasons.

Lin
 ‘certainly is an exciting new player with 20 games to his history,’ 
said Mr Costello, who is Dunkin's chief global marketing and innovation 
officer.

‘But Lebron James 
has had a fabulous nine years. We think the excitement around Jeremy Lin
 will actually create more awareness in Asia.’

James,
 27, is in his ninth NBA season since turning professional straight out 
of high school. His team, the Miami Heat, lost in last year's finals to 
the Dallas Mavericks.
