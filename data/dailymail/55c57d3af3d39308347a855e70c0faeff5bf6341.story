A girl accused of grooming her teacher into having sex with her has been treated as a criminal rather than a victim, her stepmother claimed last night.

Her comments came as it was announced that the judge who spared RE teacher Stuart Kerner a jail sentence is to be investigated.

Kerner, 44, took the then 16-year-old's virginity in a store cupboard the same week his wife miscarried and later had sex with her at his family home.

Yet Judge Joanna Greenberg QC gave him an 18-month suspended sentence.

Spared a prison sentence: Stuart Kerner, 44, at Inner London Crown Court with his wife Katherine 

She told him: 'There is no evidence that you groomed her... It was she who groomed you and you gave in to temptation.'

Last night, the stepmother of the girl, who is now 19, told the Mail: 'He's the one who's committed the crime, and yet she's the one who was treated like a criminal in that courtroom.'

She said the girl was 'devastated' by the sentence.

'What kind of a message does that send out?' she added. 'You can sleep with a schoolgirl and you'll just get away with it? That's disgusting.

'He was in the position of trust and he was the responsible adult. How could it be her fault? How can you blame a 16-year-old schoolgirl? We're all still in shock.

'The teacher slept with her, then called her a s*** and he's been allowed to get away with it.' 

During a two-week trial, the court heard that Kerner had carried around a condom for a week, telling the girl he would use it on her when she became 'too irresistible'.

He had sex with her in a store cupboard on a yoga mat in the same week that his wife miscarried their second child, the court was told.

The vice-principal at Bexleyheath Academy in south-east London also took her to his home when his wife was at work and had sex with her in their guest bedroom.

In between sex sessions he made her Marmite on toast and they watched Bargain Hunt, Inner London Crown Court heard.

His defence tried to claim that the victim had invented a fantasy relationship based on the novel Fifty Shades of Grey, in which a more experienced man has an affair with a younger woman. 

But the religious studies and ethics teacher was convicted of two counts of sexual activity with a child by a person in a position of trust. His wife Katherine is standing by him.

Last night, there was a growing backlash against the judge's decision.

Barnardo's executive director of children's services Sam Monaghan said: 'This is the wrong use of the word grooming, it's the wrong message to teachers, parents and pupils, and it's wrong to suggest that a vulnerable child is in any way responsible for their own abuse.'

A law firm also warned that judges shouldn't blame victims for the crimes of those who are in a position of trust.

Alan Collins, a solicitor with the firm, Hugh James, said: 'The teacher was in a position of trust, and no matter what the girl was saying or doing, he should have realised the danger and the inappropriateness of it all, and stopped it.

'He was the one in a position of power, and it was a breach of trust.

'You can't blame the victim.'

Judge who let RE master walk free faces an inquiry 

Judge Joanna Greenberg will be investigated by the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office after she said Kerner was 'groomed' by the schoolgirl he abused

The judge who spared teacher Stuart Kerner a jail sentence is facing an investigation.

Multiple complaints have been received about Joanna Greenberg QC's conduct.

Last night, the Judicial Conduct and Investigations Office said it was considering misconduct allegations against her.

If a complaint is upheld, it can result in a judge being disciplined, suspended or removed from office entirely.

Criticism of her comments and sentencing also gathered pace, with campaigners calling the decision 'wrong' and 'inappropriate' and complaining that it sends the wrong message to other offenders.

Meanwhile, members of the public vented their frustrations on Twitter. Leisa Rea wrote: 'Horrified that (former colleague) & teacher #StuartKerner will not go to prison for having sex with a pupil. Judge blamed the child. OUTRAGE.'

Liam Dale wrote: 'Change in law needed. #StuartKerner failed as a teacher/mentor to protect a student and pre-planned the acts.'

The Journal of Family Health tweeted: 'V disturbed by judge's comment that the pupil had *groomed* her ex-teacher Stuart Kerner. Children don't groom adults! #childsexabuse'

On the day of the sentencing, the Attorney General's office said that it was considering whether to refer the sentence to the Court of Appeal.

Yesterday, however, it emerged that it is powerless to do so because his offence is not included in the unduly lenient sentences scheme.

Judge Greenberg, 64, has 40 years' experience as a barrister, according to her profile on the Charter Chambers website.

It adds, jokily: 'Looking at her you simply would not believe she could have been in practice that long.'
