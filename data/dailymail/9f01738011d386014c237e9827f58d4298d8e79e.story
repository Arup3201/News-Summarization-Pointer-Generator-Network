A staggering nine in 10 people suffer sleepless nights, a survey has revealed.

Worry is the major reason, with a third of those polled claiming it stopped them nodding off.

And over a third of adults (35 per cent) said they often wake up three times or more a night.

The poll of 2,000 adults by the hotel chain Premier Inn, found only a quarter said they were regularly woken by their partner snoring.

Other causes were pets waking owners (eight per cent), bad dreams (20 per cent) and being woken by their own snoring (nine per cent).

Fatigue and tiredness were blamed by 25 per cent of participants for affecting their productivity, concentration and ability to do their job.

In a regional breakdown, the survey claimed that some towns and cities were worse when it comes to restless nights.

Coventry is said to be home to Britain’s biggest snorers with 40 per cent of adults woken in the night by their partner.

Liverpool is the noisy neighbour hotspot with 17 per cent complaining that rowdy residents wake them.

But the sleepless capital of Britain is Chelmsford, with a staggering 96 per cent of residents plagued by a constant lack of sleep.

A third of the town (31 per cent ) said tiredness left them grumpy the next day.

Premier Inn took over an ordinary street in Chelmsford for one night and transformed it into 'Good Night Sleep Street' so that residents could have a good night's sleep.

It provided sleep aids including a flock of sheep for residents to count and a night warden to keep noise levels at bay and provide warming drinks.

Premier Inn spokeswoman Claire Haigh said: 'Getting a good night’s sleep is a struggle for many across the nation, but it seems that the residents of Chelmsford were finding it particularly difficult to relax into a restful slumber.

“We hope that by bringing together the ingredients the nation told us help them to sleep well to the residents of Chelmsford that we’ve given them a good night’s sleep.”
