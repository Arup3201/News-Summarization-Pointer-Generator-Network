Tory defector Douglas Carswell is on course to romp home as Ukip's first Member of Parliament, a new poll suggested last night.

A survey of more than 1,000 voters in the Essex constituency of Clacton put support for Mr Carswell - who quit as its Conservative MP last week to stand for Ukip - on 56 percentage points, well ahead of the Tories on 24 points.

Labour is on 16 points while the Liberal Democrats are on a miserable two percentage points, according to the poll commissioned by former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft.

Lord Ashcroft said: 'Even allowing for some movement in vote shares as the campaign unfolds, the likely outcome is clear.

'What happens to the seat at the general election seven months later is rather less settled. As things stand, the indication is that Carswell could hold the seat, but perhaps with a reduced majority.'

The Conservatives have decided to get the contest over with as quickly as possible - announcing yesterday that it will take place on October 9, which is David Cameron's 48th birthday.

Mr Carswell, speaking in detail about his decision to defect, said the final straw came when he attended the Konigswinter Conference in Cambridge, an annual meeting of senior German and British policymakers, where he heard senior Whitehall officials pouring scorn on Mr Cameron's plan to claw back powers from Brussels.

'I was shocked, I thought the Government was serious about change. And I sat in rooms listening to some very senior people, who unlike me are not democratically accountable, who clearly decide things, and who were just contemptuously dismissive,' he told the ConservativeHome website.

'They were smirkingly, eyeball-rollingly contemptuous of even the most modest treaty reforms.'

However, Mr Carswell's potential differences with senior figures in Ukip emerged as he argued with one supporter who suggested the NHS was being exploited by immigrants.

'Remember the Olympics, the [multicultural] opening ceremony, I don't know about you but that made me feel so good about this country,' he told the voter. 'We were all together and we've got to have that sense of we're all together.'

Later, out of earshot of the Ukip supporter, he told his interviewer: 'I dislike that nativism.'

Last night Mr Cameron told a meeting of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers to focus on the 'big issues'.

The Prime Minister said: 'Let's go down to Clacton, do the job, fight for every vote. The future of our country lies in who can best run the economy.'

The Tories are considering a fullscale open primary - in which anyone in the constituency could vote - to choose their candidate to take on Mr Carswell.

It would embarrass the defector, who has previously supported their use but has been imposed on the local Ukip association. This triggered a furious response from Roger Lord, its existing general election candidate.

London Mayor Boris Johnson brushed off suggestions that he rejected a request from Tory HQ to fight the seat.

He said he had already 'whacked in the CV' for the west London constituency of Uxbridge.
