A father who didn’t have a clue what to do after the birth of his first child has given up his job to create the first app specifically designed to help out hapless new dads.

Dave Burton, 32, had his first child, a girl named Mia, with wife Sam just over two years ago.

But as soon as he brought his baby home, Dave felt completely lost and certainly not  properly briefed on what to do.

Dave quit his job as in advertising when his second child William was born and has spent the last eight months working on the app, which is already proving to be a great success.

Users can share tips and tricks that help them with their babies, and dedicated Dave has even set up a photography studio in his home to take pictures of the dads in action.

Dave, from Chalfont St Peter, Bucks., said: 'If I’m honest, I was absolutely terrified.

'When your baby is born, you suddenly feel a huge weight of responsibility and quickly realise that this tiny bundle of life is completely dependent on you.

'The thing about pregnancy is that, from a male perspective at least, the fun bit happens at the start.

'Then you get the boring bit, where nothing much happens.

'And then you get moaned at and have to be supportive and do the odd back rub or foot massage.

'When the contractions started Sam turned to me and said, ‘Shall we go to hospital?’

'In my head I am thinking, ‘I don’t know!’ Then you go through labour and I think we all know it is pretty bad.

'I was really shell shocked from a bloke’s point of view at how long it took and how much pain she was in, and how little I could do about it.

'Then we got the baby and we didn’t have a clue what to do with it. Parenting groups talk about labour but there isn’t much about what happens afterwards.'

Within the first three weeks of it being on the iTunes store, the £1.50 app was downloaded more than a thousand times by floundering fathers

He added: 'About a week after birth, I went for a quick pint with some other dads I’d met through our local parenting group.

'It
 soon became apparent that we all felt we wanted a quick database of 
practical information, ideally with loads of pictures to show us what to
 do.

'We wanted to take good care of our partner and baby, we just didn’t know how.

'That’s how I came upon the idea of Quick Tips for New Dads.'

Eight months ago, Sam gave birth to their second child, a boy named William.

Within the first three weeks of it being on the iTunes store, the £1.50 app was downloaded more than a thousand times, and Dave is now averaging in excess of 50 sales a day, as well as dozens of new tip submissions.

He said: 'The app is full of all the stuff that baby books never tell you.

'Like, for example, it’s completely normal for baby boys to get erections and for baby girls to have mini-periods after birth.

'It’s embarrassing to talk about, but these experiences are common and can leave us dads utterly bewildered.'

Quick Tips for New Dads is available to download from the iTunes App store for £1.50.
