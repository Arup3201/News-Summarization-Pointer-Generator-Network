New warning signs have been erected around Blackburn Cathedral to stop prostitutes and drug addicts using the grounds.

Cathedral bosses in Blackburn, Lancashire have finally run out of patience with prostitutes using the building's grounds as an open air brothel.

Diocesan authorities are threatening to remove the vice girls who use the alcoves and churchyard of the Anglican cathedral to ply their seedy trade, as well as drunks and drug addicts who desecrate the grounds.

They have spent £1,000 on more than a dozen signs erected on lampposts around the churchyard warning potential wrong-doers that the site is a 'sacred ancient burial ground.'

They fear the ‘disgraceful behaviour’ will deter people from enjoying the calm and tranquility of the surroundings.

The cathedral's canon Andrew Hindley 
has complained of having to move unconscious drunks from a bench when he
arrives in the morning and of dirty needles and other drug 
paraphernalia being found in the churchyard.

He
said clergy and other staff have also been threatened by drunks and 
anti-social youths when asked to move on - as well as muggings in the 
grounds, with police being called to deal with several incidents.

Canon
Hindley, who is in operational charge of the cathedral, said: 'Things are 
getting worse but that is a reflection of society at large.

'We decided we had to replace the existing signs with new tougher ones in view of what has been happening.'

After warning potential offenders that 'CCTV cameras operate in this area,' the new signs say the cathedral 'reserves the right to ask people who are treating these grounds disrespectfully to leave.'

Canon Andrew Hindley is fed up with prostitutes and drug addicts using the Cathedral's grounds.

The warning notices erected around the 
cathedral's grounds also say no litter, ball games, shouting or 
swearing, alcohol, drugs or bicycles will be allowed.

Canon Hindley said: 'The cathedral surrounds are an ancient burial ground and deserve to be treated with respect.

'We do not have a problem with young people coming and using the cathedral grounds to sit, talk and even have a cigarette.

'But we do not want people playing ball games, shouting and swearing in the grounds. This is not what they are here for.

'People should not be treating the many previous residents of Blackburn buried here with disrespect.'

He said problems had escalated in recent months with drunks coming into the grounds leaving bottles and cans around and increasing amounts of anti-social behaviour 'with broken bottles, dirty needles and drug paraphernalia left around.'

'There is a real problem with people dropping and leaving litter,' he said.

'It takes our gardeners an hour every morning to clear the grounds and obviously broken bottles and dirty needles are a health hazard.

“If people ignore the signs they will be asked to leave the grounds by clergy, vergers, and other staff. If they refuse, the police will be called to remove them.'
