Frank Bruno has claimed Jimmy Savile forced him to shake hands with the Yorkshire Ripper at Broadmoor. 

The former boxing champion said he had no idea he was meeting the serial killer until after the picture of their hand shake had been taken and if he had known it was Peter Sutcliffe he would have tried to 'get out of it.' 

After being introduced to Sutcliffe at the secure psychiatric hospital in Berkshire, Savile then sneered: 'You'll never guess who that was'.

The 50-year-old boxer says he has been haunted by the photograph ever since the meeting in 1991.

The unsuspecting boxer recalled the events after discovering his old friend of 20 years and mentor Savile was a predatory paedophile.

He said Savile introduced him to the Ripper while they were doing a walkabout of the hospital where he had just opened a gym.

Frank recalled Savile telling him, 'I want you to meet this gentleman', and said of the event, 'I didn't know who he was', and 'thought nothing of it'.

He told the Sun: 'Savile
 planned it. It was not a nice thing to do to me. If I had known it was 
the Ripper, I'd have tried to get out of it.'

The news comes after it was revealed sick pair Savile and Sutcliffe appeared to have formed a disturbing friendship, with the BBC star
 visiting the killer in jail and describing him as a 'mate' after later 
trips to see him in Broadmoor Hospital.

And a former detective who helped catch the Yorkshire Ripper last week made the shocking claim that Savile was quizzed over the serial murderer's crimes.

Former West Yorkshire detective John Stainthorpe told ITV Yorkshire Calendar News that Savile was brought in for questioning after members of the public contacted the police naming the eccentric DJ as a possible killer.

Mr Stainthorpe, who worked for the West 
Yorkshire force for more than 40 years, and who spent years trying to 
catch Sutcliffe, told the programme: 'When the Ripper was really active 
one of the suspects put forward by members of the public was Jimmy 
Savile, strange as it may seem.

'Obviously it was not him, but he was interviewed along with many others, as you can appreciate.'

It also emerged a dentist made a cast of Savile's teeth to check against the bite-marks found on the bodies of the Yorkshire Ripper's victims.

It was made clear that detectives went to some lengths to find out if Savile was connected to the shocking serial killing spree in the 1970s.

His teeth were examined in 1980, a year before Peter Sutcliffe, now 66, was convicted of murdering 13 women and attempting to kill seven others.

Two prostitutes thought to have been killed by Sutcliffe had bites on their breasts.

He denied killing one of them, but detectives at the time thought he was lying to cover for an accomplice.

Two of the Ripper's victims were found near Savile's home in Leeds, and Sutcliffe even named Savile in police interviews.

Sutcliffe was asked why he placed a victim's boots over her legs before he left the park.

He said: 'For two reasons. One, because I could hear voices from I don’t know where and a car had just driven into an entrance just behind the building — that was the block of flats I found out later where Jimmy Savile lived.

'Secondly I was surprised to see how luminous she appeared in the dark.'

Boxer Frank met Savile in the late 1980s as the began attending the same charity events. They remained friends for at least 20 years.

Last month, Frank, of Bedfordshire, who has, in the past, been forcibly sectioned under the Mental Health Act, said battling his mental health issues 'may well be the toughest fight of my life'.

He is now fighting fit and dating hairdresser Nina Colletta — his first serious relationship since divorcing wife Laura in 2001.
