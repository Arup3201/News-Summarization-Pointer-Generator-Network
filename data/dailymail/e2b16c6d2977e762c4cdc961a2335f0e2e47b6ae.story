A 19-year-old 'inexperienced' climber who spent a freezing-cold night 13,000 feet up a Colorado mountain was safely rescued Wednesday evening, and told reporters he was 'stupid' for getting stuck and 'lucky' to be alive.

A 
28-person team conducted a 'major rescue' operation 
and located Samuel Frappier around 6pm, leading him off Longs Peak and to the safety of a helicopter.

The Quebec, Canada native was then taken to the hospital for evaluation, but appeared to be just fine when he greeted reporters.

Frappier of Quebec, Canada became trapped on Longs Peak mountain in Boulder County Tuesday night, after getting separated from a friend

Frappier became stuck in an 'extremely precarious 
position' on the Boulder County mountain Tuesday night, after 
getting separated from a friend.

He called Rocky Mountain National Park officials that night to say he was uninjured, but could not move up or down the mountain. By the time rescuers arrived, his phone had died.

While Frappier has been described as 'physically fit' he is apparently an 'inexperienced climber' and didn't have the climbing equipment or proper clothes to spent a night on the mountain.

Frappier was wearing just cotton clothes and tennis shoes as temperatures dipped into the 30s overnight.

Officials spoke with Frappier Wednesday morning and a helicopter crew spent the day conducting reconnaissance and setting up rescue supplies.

Conditions were not ideal this morning since the sun was melting snow and ice on the east face, leading to significant snow and rock fall.

But temperatures cooled in the afternoon which made the mountain more stable and safer for the rescue mission.
