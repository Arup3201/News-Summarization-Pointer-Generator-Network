Prince Harry's girlfriend Cressida Bonas has put her face to the no make-up selfie campaign.

Miss Bonas, 25, has revealed her natural beauty by posting the photograph in support of the fight against cancer.

She joins a number of famous faces to put their name to the craze, which has so far raised £8 million for Cancer Research.

The photograph emerges after the Miss Bonas and her boyfriend were recently spotted on a skiing trip to Kazakhstan.

Staying at a resort owned by a wealthy oligarch with ties to the dictatorship's political elite, the couple flew by government helicopter to the exclusive resort of Shymbulak in the former Soviet state for a ‘private holiday’.

In a major step in their relationship, it was revealed last week that Miss Bonas had been invited to accompany the prince to an official engagement in the Queen’s rooms at St James’s Palace on March 27.

The Prince hosted a private dinner party in the official rooms to honour the friends he made during a 208-mile trek to the South Pole before Christmas.

Guests were told their partners, wives and girlfriends were welcome and Miss Bonas was said to fall 'into that category’.
