Police in the Texas city of Rosenberg are hunting an armed robber who held up a family inside a gated community at gunpoint.

However the sketch that investigators released of the armed gunman shows he was wearing a grey Los Angeles Dodges shirt and not much else.

The aggravated robbery occurred last Saturday inside the parking lot of the Place Apartments on Vista Drive about 6.30pm.

The victim, Olivia Bell, said she was getting out her car with her boyfriend and two-year-old daughter when the man approached them in a ski mask.

Wanted: Police in Rosenberg, Texas, have released this sketch of a  masked gunman who robbed a mom and her young daughter last weekend. The white male suspect was wearing a Los Angeles Dodgers jersey

Ms Bell said her first instinct was to slam the door of the car to protect her daughter, who was still on the backseat.

'I just thought please Lord, don't let him hurt my baby, not my baby,' she told KHOU.

Th robber demanded everything the couple had, and made off with their phones, iPad, wallets and diaper bag.

'I guess he was hoping there was something so great in the diapers,' Bell said.

It was at that point the bandit realized Ms Bell had a child and said to her: 'I'm sorry, but I have to pay my bills.' 

Police believed the man is linked to at least two other robberies in the area.

They warned Rosenberg residents to be careful at night, particularly parents, who seem to be the man's prey.

The suspect is described as a white male, of about 5 feet 10 to 6 feet tall.

Ms Bell and her boyfriend worked on the sketch for police. 

No injuries have been involved in the robberies. 

Anyone with information can contact Detective R. Leonhardt - anonymously or not - at 832-595-3700 or contact Crime Stoppers at 281-342-TIPS (8477).
