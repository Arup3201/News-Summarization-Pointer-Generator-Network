Mother-of-four Julie Bradshaw fraudulently claimed £53,482 in benefits over an eight-year period

A mother-of-four has been jailed for six months for swindling taxpayers out of more than £53,000 in benefits and paying back just £600.

Julie Bradshaw, 38, fraudulently claimed £53,482 in handouts over an eight-year period.

After honestly applying for benefits in 1999, Bradshaw failed to reveal she was no longer entitled to the financial support when her partner moved in with her in 2003.

Bradshaw started making honest claims for income support in 1999 and the following year began to claim for housing and council tax benefits.

But in 2003, the 38-year-old failed to disclose to Stoke-on-Trent City Council that her partner had moved in.

Instead, the mother-of-four continued to take the handouts.

Judge Paul Glenn sentencing Bradshaw at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court jailed her, after hearing she has repaid just £600 of the money she stole - 1.12 per cent of what she owes.

Judge Glenn told Bradshaw: 'You had three children with your partner who was in full-time employment.

'You knew full well that you had a duty to report changes in circumstances which might affect your entitlement to benefits.

'But you continued to claim because you had plainly become accustomed to the additional income that the benefits provided.'

In an interview, Bradshaw told investigators at the Department for Work and Pensions, that her partner is the father of her three youngest children and a father figure to her eldest.

At first she denied he lived with her, telling them he only stayed at weekends.'

But it emerged that in 2011, he bought a house near to her home and she was living with him there.

In total Bradshaw was £26,939 in extra income support, £21,691 in housing benefit and £4,851 in council tax benefit.

Bradshaw, of Tunstall in 
Staffordshire, admitted two charges of dishonestly failing to give 
prompt notification of a change of circumstances affecting her 
entitlement to benefits between September 2003 and July 2011.

She
 pleaded guilty on the basis that their relationship was volatile, her 
partner would often live elsewhere and she might have qualified for some
 benefits.

Judge Paul Glenn jailed the mother-of-four for six months after hearing she has only paid back £600 of the thousands she owes

Robert Smith, defending, said one of Bradshaw’s sons has special needs and she is his primary carer.

Stoke-on-Trent City Council - which operates its Spot the Cheater campaign - expects to recover around £1.2 million in wrongly-claimed benefits this financial year.

More than 1,100 calls to report fraudsters have been made since April last year ~ with 297 relating to people who claim they are living alone.

City Councillor Terry Crowe, cabinet member for finance, said: 'Benefits are there to support those genuinely in need.

'People abusing the system are illegally taking money from the public purse - effectively stealing from neighbours, friends, and family.'
