From the puritanical standards of beauty in 1910, to the eclectic styles of the 2000s and natural looks of today, a fascinating new time-lapse video documents how hairstyles have changed over the past century.

The video, created by the team at Cut Video, shows how afro-textured hair trends have evolved over 100 years in just one minute.

For the 20s look, model Marshay Mitchell showcases elegant and glamorous slicked down marcel curls often sported by notorious flapper Josephine Baker.

A gold sequin headband with brown feather completes the hair look of the decade, and Marshay wears a plum lipstick concentrated in the centre of her pout, with arched, downwards pointing eyebrows and smoky eyes. 

Hair stylist Juel Bergholm moves on to create styles featuring hair accessories such as faux flowers, net fascinators and headbands, as she creates ladylike looks from the 30s, 40s and 50s. 

For the 1950s style Marshay sports a cheesecake faux smile fringe, a look often seen on the women of the day. 

Following the end of the Second World War, women became increasingly glamorous and immaculate.

They embraced traditional, conservative values of beauty and with it came beautifully sculpted bouffants, and the iconic 'doe eye' created with heavy eyeliner and bright lips. 

The make up, created by Lisa Margaret Corr, showed how ruby lips stayed popular throughout this period, until the return of nude for the swinging 60s.

As proven in the video, the decade was all about the apologetically voluminous beehive.

The look was created in 1954 by Chicago-based hairdresser Margaret Vinci Heldt who was asked by the editors of a glossy magazine to conjure up a style to reflect the next decade - it became a sartorial hit.

Next up came the 1970s - and a social revolution. Indeed, hair reflected this and was worn big and natural, often styled with an afro comb, as pictured. 

The look was popularisedby the likes of Diana Ross.

As for 1980, as seen in the video, hair stayed big but got creative and styled to the side.

Makeup got bright, at times flourescent, with eyeshadow and lipstick palettes of fuchsia pinks and vibrant violents.

As the footage ventures into 1990, it's clear that female musicians like Destiny's Child and Brandy were hugely influential. 

Hair was worn in braids, sometimes half up half down, and big gold hoops were all the rage. Natural-toned makeup was in.

Entering a new millennium, hairstyles of 2000 merged braiding and natural afro curls. 

The final look in the video is 2010, showcasing natural afro hair and makeup, as seen on Solange Knowles.

nice'n easy colour Advisor Jonathan Long comments on the hair colour trends through the decades:

1930s:

'In the 1930's with the already vibrant Art Noveau, and the more recent Art Deco trends spreading across Europe and America, hair became more graphic and bold. The look was short, jaw length hair, with strong shape. Long hair tended to be pin curled at the front to resemble jaw length hair and kept small and tight in a chignon style at the back. Colours were bold, single applications of primary colours; the purest tone. If it was blonde it was the cleanest, purest platinum possible and if it was dark it was deep and strong to give strength and density to the shape.'

1940s:

'In the 1940's, even in the midst of war with clothing and fabric rationing, people took great pride in their hair. The updos of the 30's continued but hair naturally became longer and darker giving way to beautiful deep rich dark tones which would be set on pin curls then brushed through to create that classic wave of the 40's. Raven haired beauties like style icon Ava Gardener epitomised the 40's and took the lime light with beautiful blondes like Veronica Lake becoming more rarely seen on screen.'

1950s:

'With the constraints of war at an end, glamour became popular and women wanted to create a hair look that implied 'domestic goddess'. Women looked to the glamour of Marilyn Monroe and the decade's other big Hollywood screen vamps and sirens for inspiration. Intense red coloured lips and platinum blonde hair became popular, highlighting a pale complexion.'

1960s:

'Women were moving into the workplace and wanted a more manageable and achievable day-time look. Hair colour was kept simple, with the emphasis on natural, healthy-looking colour like nice'n easy Sunkissed. Blonde was still the key colour but a more natural darker blonde with highlights, made famous by Ursula Andress and Bridget Bardot. Darker hair was often given highlights and the sun-kissed look by soaking strands of hair in lemon juice and sitting in the sun.'

1970s:

'At the beginning of the 1970's a dark natural blonde look remained popular, inspired by Farrah Fawcett from the cult series 'Charlies Angels'. Hair was all about manes of free-falling curls, soft partings and long fringes completed by bronzed skin. However by the end of the era with the 'Punk' movement, women like Toyah Wilcox started to experiment with hair colour. For the first time we saw vivid primary or fluorescent hair colours emerging.'

1980s:

'Women were opting for intense strong colour to compliment 'power dressing'. Rich brunettes and strong blondes were all the rage, inspired by Dynasty characters' Krystle Carrington (Linda Evans) and Alexis (Joan Collins). On the other hand, the rebellious streak that started with punk continued with women led by Madonna wanting an ever-changing hair colour to go with their unconventional, eccentric clothing.'

1990s and 2000s:

'During the 1990's and naughties, the whole world went back to blonde all over again! Each season we see the emergence of new hair colour trends, but our love of blondes remains constant throughout. Multi-toned inspired highlights, which can be achieved at home with nice'n easy Sunkissed, or an all over blonde – any shade of blonde in fact, even previously brunette models and film stars turned blonde.'

2010s:

'With all of the resources available to us today in the 2010s, blonde is still the desired hair colour of choice. The blondes of today are much easier going and less high maintenance. Multi-tonal, sun kissed, sandy blondes have replaced the all over block colours of previous years, allowing for that organic look and feel. We are entering into an era of huge change in hair colour and the way that people perceive hair colour. In the 2010s it should be a part of you not something extra added. With the likes of Scarlett Johansson opting to 'dress it down' instead of 'up' with her tousled sandy, sun kissed locks at this year's Oscars showing her real natural beauty, you can definitely see the change we are heading for!'
