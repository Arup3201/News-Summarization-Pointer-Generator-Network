At 12.40pm on Thursday in lane four of the Tollcross pool where he learnt to swim, Scotland’s Michael Jamieson will begin his bid for Commonwealth gold in heat three of the 200 metres breaststroke.

He won silver in Delhi four years ago, silver at the world short-course championships in 2012 and silver at the London Olympics. It is now ‘time to step up’, in his home town at his home Games. Jamieson wants gold.

‘I was always a bit wary of saying “I want to win gold” because I didn’t want to jinx it,’ he said. ‘But everyone knows that’s the result I want. This is the biggest event of my life. I feel like it’s not just for me, it’s for everybody.

Carrying the flag: Swimmer Michael Jamieson is Scotland's poster boy for the Commonwealth Games

‘On day one there’s a bit of responsibility there as well, not just for the swimmers but for the whole of Team Scotland. We’re looking to win more medals than we have ever done, so I want to play my part in that.’

Expectation will be pressing down on Jamieson’s powerful shoulders as he dives into that pool. He has been training 30 hours a week for more than a decade, rising at 5.45am, practising until 10am, feeding up and then doing it all again from 2pm until 6pm.

He is also the poster boy for these Games and the timetable has been designed so he can, hopefully, get Scotland off to a winning start.

To his credit, Jamieson has embraced the hype and the swimmer has been talking to a sports psychologist to try to ensure he enjoys the experience, as well as achieving success.

No pressure: Jamieson opens proceedings for Scotland and will want a winning start

‘The first time I had a taste of sports psychology was in the lead-in to London,’ he says. ‘I wanted to walk out for the final and just be relaxed. Now I know how to do that and the goal for me is getting the balance between enjoying the event — because it’s my home Games in my home town — and not putting too much pressure on myself.

‘But that’s the lifestyle and I love it. I train to compete at events like the Commonwealth Games, so I’m so eager to make the most of it.’

Jamieson has been ‘flogging’ himself to ensure he arrives in Glasgow in the form of his life. He loves that aspect of his sport, but trying to push his body to its limits led to a heart scare late last year.

He ‘felt funny’ during a weights session, but warmed up to swim anyway, dived in and then realised his heart-rate was through the roof. He was admitted to hospital with an irregular heartbeat.

‘They slow your heart-rate down and give you a bit of an electric shock and that re-sets it,’ he explains.

Jamieson describes this process very casually. He is wary of it being seen as an excuse for potential failure. He insists he does not feel any after-effects, but he knows the problem could have ended his career.

‘It was a strange situation,’ he says. ‘At 25, you don’t expect to have heart problems — you’re supposed to be in the shape of your life. I was pretty calm, but I had a 10-minute period where I had a bit of a panic.

‘I was in the main theatre room and the doctor said, “There’s a 48-hour window where, if a patient displays the same symptoms, we can treat it. Outside that it becomes a bit more complicated and you might have to step away from swimming”.

‘That made me think, “I’ve got to make the most of this”. There is nothing to be worried about, but I can’t explain why it happened the first time and, if it happened again, I don’t think I’d be able to keep swimming.

‘It made me take stock and think I have to make the most of it.’ 

It is a thought that is driving on 
Jamieson. For all the pressure that has been put on the Scot ahead of 
Thursday’s event, the greatest pressure still comes from within.
