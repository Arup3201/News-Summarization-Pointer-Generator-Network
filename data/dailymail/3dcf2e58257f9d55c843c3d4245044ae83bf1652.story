A rising number of women are complaining of 'mummy's thumb', a form of tendonitis linked to lifting babies

Women being 'weaker than they used to be' is to blame for a growing number of new mothers experiencing an injury known as 'mummy thumb'.

Older generations of women would regularly make their own bread, kneeding the dough, they would hand wash the clothes and perform other grueling daily chores.

But in a world where bread makers and washing machines are a staple in the kitchen, women are suffering.

Chartered physiotherapist Sammy Margo told MailOnline a more sedentary lifestyle means women are 'generally weaker than they used to be'.

That, she says, is the reason for an increasing number of women complaining of 'mummy thumb', known by its medical term de Quervain's tenosynovitis.

It is a painful condition affecting the tendons in the thumb, that run down the side to the wrist.

Women suffering 'mummy's thumb', commonly complain of pain every time they turn their wrist, go to grasp objects or make a fist.

Ms Margo said repeatedly lifting a baby can cause the condition to develop.

She said: 'When you have a baby the ligaments in the body relax, and then all of a sudden, with weaker ligaments and floppy tendons you have to effectively weight lift all day.

'Statistically on average a new mother will lift their baby 25 to 30 times a day.

'Years ago we used to treat a lot of cases of washer women's knee, when women would hand wash clothes regularly.

'But as the times have changed, we no longer see that injury. Instead we are seeing more cases of "mummy's thumb" because historically women used to be stronger and so more prepared for the task of lifting a heavy baby all day.'

While it is a common injury, Ms Margo said as a physiotherapist she only sees the most severe of cases.

'I am treating several mums with 'mummy thumb' at the moment,' she told MailOnline.

'But most mothers, busy with their babies, will put off going to seek treatment, instead researching the condition online.

'Being a new mum is a very special time so only those that are really suffering will find time to come and get treatment.'

Though referred to as 'mummy' thumb', the condition is not a new one.

Physiotherapist Sammy Margo said one of the reasons behind the rise in the injury, treated using a splint, is the fact women are 'not as strong as they used to be'. A more sedentary lifestyle has resulted in women not building up the strength needed to 'effectively weight lift all day', after giving birth, Ms Margo told MailOnline

'Mummy's thumb' known by its medical name, de Quervain's tenosynovitis is a painful condition affecting the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist.

People suffering de Quervain's tenosynovitis, will probably feel pain every time they turn their wrist, grasp anything or make a fist.

Although the exact cause is not known, any activity that relies on repetitive hand or wrist movement - such as working in the garden, playing golf or racket sports or lifting your baby - can make it worse.Â 

Symptoms of de Quervain's tenosynovitis include:

Pinching, grasping and other movements of the thumb and wrist aggravate the pain.

Chronic overuse of the wrist is commonly associated with the condition.

People between the ages of 30 and 50 have a higher risk of developing de Quervain's tenosynovitis.

The condition is more common in women than in men, and it may be associated with pregnancy. Baby care, which involves using your thumbs as leverage to lift your child hundreds of times a day, may also be associated with the condition.Source: Mayo Clinic

Ms Margo said it has been around for years, and in recent years was known as 'texting thumb injury'.

'As mobile phones started to get smaller, we started to see cases of what became known as 'texting thumb injury',' she said.

'It is the same condition, a form of tendonitis. Different lifestyle factors mean we see it coming to the forefront.'

Ms Margo said new mothers can help reduce the risk of suffering 'mummy's thumb' by regularly using aids, including feeding pillows to bring the baby closer, without lifting.

She added: 'For some mothers the condition will just burn out and ease off.

'The condition is particularly prevalent when mothers are breast feeding.

'When you breast feed the body releases a hormone called relaxin, which causes the collagen in the body to become more soft, leaving the joints more lax.

'When mothers stop breast feeding, generally the condition will ease off in three to four months.

'In more severe cases the condition needs hands-on manual therapy and in some cases hand splints.'

She said women can take action before they fall pregnant, to build their strength and be mindful of the task ahead.

Researchers at the Mayo Clinic, in the U.S. say people aged between 30 and 50 have a higher risk of developing de Quervain's tenosynovitis.

They note the injury is 'more common in women than in men, and it may be associated with pregnancy'.

'Baby care, which involves using your thumbs as leverage to lift your child hundreds of times a day, may also be associated with the condition,' their website states.
