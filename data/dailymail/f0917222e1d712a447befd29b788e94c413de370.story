Radamel Falcao started in attack for Manchester United's Under 21 side just 24 hours after being given the cold shoulder by Louis van Gaal.

The Colombian striker, who was an unused substitute during United's FA Cup defeat at the hands of Arsenal on Monday night, was named in a strong starting XI which also included fellow first team stars Rafael, James Wilson and Victor Valdes.

Falcao, who earns £280,000 a week at the Barclays Premier League outfit, was replaced in the 72nd minute after failing to hit the back of the net in what proved to be yet another lifeless display.

Rafael showed Falcao how to it's done by chipping Spurs keeper Luke McGee with his left foot from 30 yards  to cancel out lively Tottenham midfielder Kenny McEvoy's opener.

Falcao now has just 10 first team games to prove his worth to Manchester United manager Van Gaal before the end of his season-long loan deal.

Manchester United have an option to sign Falcao on a permanent basis for £43million in the summer with Van Gaal deciding to stall his decision for as long as possible.

Falcao has scored just four goals since joining the Red Devils on a temporary deal - with his latest strike coming against Leicester City on January 31.

United boss Van Gaal jumped to the defence of Falcao on Monday night by hitting out at the press for criticising the former Atletico Madrid star.

'He scored four goals and has three or four assists, so that is his contribution,' said a clearly annoyed Van Gaal. 'And he stimulates also the other players, so that's also an aspect of the profession.'

'But it is now easy for you to say that (criticism of Falcao), and that's why you are saying that. And you are very happy to say that, I see that in your face.' 

Victor Valdes, on the other hand, has not made a senior appearance for United since finalising his move to Old Trafford at the beginning of January, while Rafael appears to be heading for the exit door.

Manchester United goalkeeper Valdes is yet to make a first team appearance since joining the Red Devils 

Rafael's last appearance for Manchester United came against Yeovil Town at the beginning of January
