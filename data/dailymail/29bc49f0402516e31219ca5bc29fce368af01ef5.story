A parish council discussion about geese in the village pond would normally warrant barely a ripple of interest.

But police were called when a villager got into a flap amid claims that she was not being allowed to film just such a debate.

Sandy Maynard said councillors in Beyton, near Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, failed to provide a decent vantage point and that when she moved from the designated spot, the chairman’s wife, Mary Wyartt, 71, repeatedly tried to obscure her view.

In a final attempt to exercise her right to record proceedings, she told councillors they would have to call police to stop her – and they duly took up her challenge.

Two officers arrived, but took no further action when a member of the public assured them things were under control.

Mrs Maynard, 67, a retired secondary school teacher, said: ‘Unfortunately, my camera stopped recording just as [chairman] Roger Wyartt yelled “You can’t film this”.

‘Calling the police was unnecessary and embarrassing. When they arrived, someone ran out and spoke to them and they never came in, although it hadn’t even calmed down at that point. What a waste of police time.’

Mrs Maynard and her partner Andrew Nimmons, 70, a retired farm worker, are concerned about the council’s ‘inhumane’ policy of reintroducing geese to the village green.

There used to be ten birds at the spot but all died, the mother of one says, because of problems such as dog attacks, being run over by cars or having inadequate shelter.

The council brought in another 15 birds last summer after a poll in which 78 per cent of locals supported the idea – but three have already died.

‘They should not be putting more animals in a situation where they could be killed,’ Mrs Maynard said.

Councillors were forced to accept the filming of meetings last year after a change of law, which led to three members quitting.

The incident happened at the meeting of Beyton Parish Council

Last night Mr Wyartt blamed a ‘small minority’ who oppose the reintroduction of geese for disrupting the January 5 meeting.

He said: ‘We have been given guidelines from the Suffolk Association of Local Councils. It says the parish council chairman can set a designated filming area. She was not filming from the area we provided.

‘I am quite a big fellow. I could have manhandled her out, but that would have been a bigger headline than the one we are looking at now.’

He added: ‘The filming itself is not the problem – it’s the harassment and abuse caused by cutting it and editing it and putting it on YouTube, which just makes the work of a parish councillor that much harder.’

Suffolk Police said two officers went to the meeting but stood down after being told ‘everything was in order’.
