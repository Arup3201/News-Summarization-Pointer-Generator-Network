A couple have been given a 'second chance' at love after losing more than 20st between them.

James and Joyce Quinn, from Irvine, North Ayrshire, declared: 'Losing 20 stone saved our marriage,' as they were named Slimming World's Couple of the Year 2013.

Mr Quinn, 45, struggled with his weight after he was made redundant from his job as a sports instructor. At his heaviest he weighed more than 27st.

The way they were: The couple have lost a huge amount of weight between them on Slimming World diet plans

'I was a sports instructor and very active, but I lost my job and went to work as a manager in a video shop.

'I was eating the same foods but I wasn't burning them off anymore,' he said.

The father-of-four and grandfather-of-one said the weight put a strain on his family life. 'I'd given up on life.

'I genuinely thought my family would be better off if I went to sleep one night and didn't wake up.

'I didn't do anything around the house, Joyce did everything for me and it was affecting our relationship,' he said.

Mr Quinn, 45, finally decided to do something about his problem after getting measured for a kilt for his niece's wedding.
