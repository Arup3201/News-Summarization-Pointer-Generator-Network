A convenience store owner has been charged with murder after what police believe to be a suspicious fire explosion, which claimed the lives of three people earlier this month.

Police allege the fire was deliberately lit and arrested  Adeel Khan from Greenacre, in Sydney's south-west, on Tuesday at about 8.30am at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Camperdown.

The 44-year-old was charged with several offences including three counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder.

Adeel Khan, 44, has been arrested in hospital over the fire explosion in Rozelle - Sydney's inner west - that killed three people

Emergency services were called to a fire explosion at a convenience store on Darling Street on September 4

Bianka O'Brien and one-year-old son Jude, along with 27-year-old neighbour Chris Noble, died in the fire in Rozelle, Sydney's inner west.

Another three people were injured, including store owner Adeel Khan who denied responsibility for the tragedy.

He was also charged with three counts of manslaughter and 17 charges relating to the damage of property, including one count of setting fire for a financial gain.

Mr Khan, who was rescued from the fire, became the focus of police inquiries after he was admitted to hospital in Sydney's south west.

When the Pakistan Consul visited Khan in hospital, the shop owner said the blast was started by a gas cylinder.

Daily Telegraph reports than Mr Khan told the consul member: 'I didn't do anything. I don't know what happened, I am very upset.'

'I have sympathy with the people who lost their lives.' 

However reports claim his wife  was worried about her husband's unusual disappearance from their home in south-west Sydney at 4am - the morning the shop on Darling Street was destroyed in the fatal explosion.

A close friend revealed Naima Adeel was concerned when she discovered her husband wasn't at their Greenacre home and tried to reach him on his phone a number of times.

Days after the fire rocked the close-knit community, neighbours told media outlets that Mr Khan usually closed his store at midnight and reopened it at 7am.

Rozelle businesses say it was unusual for Mr Khan who wasn't often seen behind the counter of his business, to be at the shop that early as it doesn't open until about 7am.

But Ms Adeel, who has been questioned by police over the fatal fire at Rozelle, has also dismissed allegations her husband was involved and labelled them as 'rumours'.

Soon after the blast on September 4, police discovered traces of petrol at the Rozelle convenience store which burnt to the ground.

Mr Khan will remain in hospital under police guard and there will be a bedside hearing.
