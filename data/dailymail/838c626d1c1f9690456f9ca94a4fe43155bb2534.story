A major new credit card scam has been uncovered  claiming to offer 'customer support' and making charges of $9.84 to accounts.

The Better Business Bureau today warned the unexpected charges are a clear sign the consumers card number is being used by crooks.

Those who investigated the charge were send to a page offering 'customer support' - which was also part of the scam.

A major new credit card scam has been uncovered  claiming to offer ' customer support' and making charges of $9.84 to accounts.

A series of small payments, usually for $9.84, are made to stolen card numbers.

The source listed on the bill is an unfamiliar website.

The web address leads to a generic landing page that claims to offer 'Customer Support.'

The text promises to 'refund 100% of your last payment' and provides a phone number and email address - but payments are never returned.

'With this new con, scammers are banking on the fact that many consumers don’t check their credit card statements all that carefully,' the Better Business Bureau warns.

'Don’t fall for it.

'Review your recent statements for unexplained charges of $9.84 and contest them with your bank or credit card issuer (call the number on the back of your card).'

The scam is designed to play on the fact many consumers do not check their statements thoroughly.

By putting through small amounts for generic terms such as customer support, the scammers hope the transaction will go unnoticed.

'The expectation is that many cardholders won’t notice the relatively 
small charge, and the credit card companies won’t go after such a minor 
sum,' the Better Business Bureau says.

Some victims even report calling the 'customer support' site and receiving verbal confirmation that the charge would be canceled - but the refund does not appear.

The bureau advises people to cancel their card immediately should they be concerned.

'Your card card information has been compromised, and it’s likely scammers will be back for more,' they say.

The fraud, uncovered by a former Washington Post reporter who writes an investigative blog called KrebsOnSecurity, apparently relies on consumer carelessness.

It is believed to be connected to the recent huge haul of credit card numbers from Target's web site

Hackers reportedly stole tens of millions of customers' personal information, including their names, mailing addresses, phone numbers and email addresses from several retailers.

Target was worst hit, as around 70 million Target customers had their information stolen.

Krebs writes in his blog that the charges, most of which were reported over the holiday season, may have been spotted because consumers are being more vigilant in the wake of the Target breach.

'It’s still not clear how consumers’ card numbers are being stolen here, but the fraud appears to stem from an elaborate network of affiliate schemes that stretch from Cyprus to India and the United Kingdom,' he wrote.
