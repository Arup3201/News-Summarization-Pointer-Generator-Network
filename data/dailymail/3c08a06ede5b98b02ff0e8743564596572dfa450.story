A witness told Cannock Coroner's Court that a pheasant flew out from a hedgerow and hit Mr Johnson's head and neck

A motorcyclist was killed in a freak accident after he was knocked off his bike by a flying pheasant.

Musician Matthew Johnson, 32, was thrown off balance when the bird flew out from a near-side hedge and hit the side of his helmet.

An inquest heard it is likely Mr Johnson was hit by his Kawasaki bike, which he bought in 2010, as it 'cartwheeled' down the road before plunging into nearby trees.

He was riding under the 60mph speed limit and had not been drinking.

He had left his work at Stafford College and was travelling towards Hilderstone at the time of the accident on December 29 last year.

The college tutor died at the scene on the B5066 Sandon Road near Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, from multiple injuries.

The impact of the collision was such that Mr Johnson's helmet visor was found embedded in the dead bird further along the road.

Passing cyclist David Stonier told Cannock Coroner's Court an 'explosion of feathers' shielded his view of the accident after he saw the pheasant shoot out of a hedgerow into Mr Johnson's head.

Mr Stonier found him lying in a ditch and two passers-by tried to resuscitate him.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, coroner Andrew Haigh said: 'This really is an unfortunate combination of events coming together.

'This is a tragic accident.'

Members of Mr Johnson's family told the inquest they believed he had hit a manhole to lose control of his bike.

Sister Vicky Johnson-Phillips, 36, said: 'Bikers do seem to have a bad reputation but this goes to show he was doing everything right and none of this was his fault.

'He was the most genuine person I have ever known.'

Mr Johnson's friend of 12 years, Nathan James, 35, said: 'I have lost my best friend. He was an amazing guy.

'The inquest has shown that he didnâ€™t simply lose control of his bike.'

Matthew Johnson, of Waverton Road, Bentilee, was a talented musician well-known in the area's arts scene. He also taught percussion to year 11 students at Brownhills Academy, Stoke-on-Trent.

He won the BBC talent show Get Your Act Together in 1999 as part of teenage band Marlo when he was 19 years old.
