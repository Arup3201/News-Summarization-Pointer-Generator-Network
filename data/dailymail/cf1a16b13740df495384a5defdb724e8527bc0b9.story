A 22-year-old medical student has been gang raped by three men who snatched her from the campus of a prestigious university in India.

The girl was abducted from Manipal University in Karnataka as she was walking back to her room from the library at around 11.45pm on Thursday night.

Three men in an auto-rickshaw are said to have grabbed the woman and driven her to an isolated spot where they are alleged to have raped her, leaving her with a broken leg and back and neck injuries.

Attack: The medical student, 22, was gang-raped by three men who snatched her as she walked back to her room from the library at Manipal University in Karnataka

The student was admitted to hospital for treatment on Thursday night and is now said to be 'out of danger'.

The girl, who returned to campus in the early hours of Friday morning, was described as being in shock and 'incoherent' in the wake of the incident.

Police said it was unclear if she was driven back to the university by her attackers or managed to return on her own.

No arrests have been made in connection with the incident, but the superintendent of police in Udupi district said officers were hoping for an 'early breakthrough' in catching the suspects.

The girl is believed to be from Kerala.

'The victim is out of danger and recovering,' said Dr Boralingaiah.

'She suffered a fracture in the leg and injuries on her back and neck. We are conducting investigations and are hopeful of an early breakthrough.

'It's not clear if she was dropped off by her abductors or she managed to return on her own,' he told the Times of India.

'She is in shock and her statements are incoherent.'

Shashi Tharoor, the minister of state for human resources and development, said he had been in touch with officials in Karnataka to call for intensified police patrols around the university.

'So many Kerala kids are studying in Karnataka& parents are worried about their safety,' Mr Tharoor said on Twitter. The girl cannot recall where she was taken, he said, adding, "We haven't got the medical report, but the estate officer filed a report of rape."
