A lawyer for three of the men accused of the brutal rape and killing of a 23-year-old woman in New Delhi claims his clients have been tortured and coerced into admitting the crime.

He made the accusation as he entered court this morning where the five suspects appeared for a second time amid heavy security, charged with abduction, rape and murder.

Manohar Lal Sharma told the BBC that one of the men had been tortured for 10 days.

Mr Sharma said he plans to represent bus driver Ram Singh and his brother Mukesh as well as a third man Akshay Thakur and they planned to plead not guilty.

'This 22-year-old boy was picked up from his village,' said Mr Sharma.

'He was tortured for 10 days. He was coerced into admission. He's unable to speak now.

'All these people have been tortured badly. It's under pressure that they have made statements in court.'

Delhi police spokesman Rajan Bhagat refused to comment, citing legal restrictions.

Undecided: Today's hearing was expected to result in the case being sent to a special 'fast-track' court, but a decision was not made as the court ruled that the charge-sheet needed more scrutiny

Today's hearing was expected to result in the case being sent to a special 'fast-track' court, but a decision was not made as the court ruled that the charge-sheet needed more scrutiny.

The case has now been adjournted until January 14 and although India's legal system is slow and inefficient, but officials are eager to make sure the high-profile case moves quickly.

'They are innocent,' said Mr Sharma, who added that he took the case in part to confront the police over 'how manipulated evidence is placed for fixing the innocent people.'

A sixth suspect, who is thought to be 17, will be tried separately in a youth court if it is confirmed he is a minor.

Five men have been charged with attacking the 23-year-old woman and her male companion on a bus as it was driven through streets of India's capital.

The woman was raped and assaulted with a metal bar on December 16 and eventually died of her injuries.

Rape victims are not identified in India, even if they die, and rape trials are closed to the media.

Another lawyer, VK Anand, says he also represents the two Singh brothers. It is not yet clear if the other defendants have lawyers.

Large protests have taken place across India since the attack, with women telling relentless stories of abuse - from catcalls to bus gropings to rapes - and of a police and judicial system that does little to stop it.

Authorities have charged the men with murder, rape and other crimes that could bring the death penalty.

Heartbreak: Badri Singh, father of the woman who was gang-raped and murdered in India, has said that he had been hopeful that his daughter would make a full recovery from her horrific injuries

Outspoken: Mr Singh spoke to ITV1's Daybreak show in India this morning. He said that he hopes his daughter's death will 'awaken' the country

A sixth suspect, who is 17, is 
expected to be tried in a juvenile court where the maximum sentence 
would be three years in a reform facility.

Prosecutor
Rajiv Mohan said last week that a DNA test confirmed that the blood of 
the victim matched blood stains found on the clothes of all the accused.

The news comes after the father of 
the murdered woman has described her desperate battle for life - and his
futile hope that she would live.

Anger: Protestors had given the victim the name Damini after a Bollywood film of the same name where the protagonist fought for justice after a rape ordeal. She was identified when her father decided to break his silence and speak out

Outrage: Protestors hold candles in New Delhi last month as they took to the streets in anger following the 23-year-old students gang-rape and murder

Badri
Singh said that although he knew that his daughter was 'in a bad state'
after she was attacked by six men in Delhi last month, he still 
believed she might recover after she was taken to hospital in Singapore.

But the 23-year-old physiotherapy student was to die after sustaining horrific injuries during the assault.

Speaking to ITV1's Daybreak, Mr Singh said: 'When we went to Singapore she was not conscious but she had tears in her eyes. Then I realised she was in a really bad state.

'I couldn’t think what to do at that time, I was like a bird without wings, I was neither here nor there.

'So
when I thought she might get better, I used to get filled with some 
hope. When I was told that she might not get well and might have to have
an operation I felt uncomfortable.

'It
was difficult for me, but when she was put on a ventilator it gave me 
some hope that she would get better. I thought she might get better and 
she would live.'

Mr Singh 
said that his daughter's death 13 days after the horrific attack has 
'brought an awakening' to Indian society and called for his country to 
no longer turn a blind eye to attacks on women.

He added that he would like to see a new law or a hospital named after his daughter.

Describing
his daughter, Mr Singh said: 'When she was born my aunties and uncles 
always used to carry her around, those were really lovely days.

'Right
from the start her ambition was to be a doctor. Her main aim was that 
our family wouldn’t have to suffer any more, she wanted to put the 
difficult life behind us, wipe out our poverty.

'She also wanted to make sure I didn’t have to keep working hard late in life.'

The young student was attacked 
on an illegal bus in Delhi on December 16 and her and a male friend were
left for dead on the road.

She eventually died in a hospital in Singapore after having 90 per cent of her intestines removed.

Her death sparked anger across India.

Meanwhile, the victim's companion on the night of the attack, 28-year-old software engineer Awindra Pandey, has spoken out about the terrible ordeal and his friend's horrific injuries.

Treatment: The rape victim was taken to intensive care at a Singapore hospital but died of her injuries

Poignant: White lilies could be seen in the back of the ambulance as the body was transported through the city

He told The Times that his efforts to flag down help from passing motorists after the pair had been dumped in the road were ignored for 20 minutes.

Mr Pandey said that police were reluctant to help his friend despite her injuries.

'She was asking for water and complaining of pain in her stomach,' he said.

'She was bleeding heavily. They (the police) asked me to put her in the van.'

He said that the pair, who were not dating, had been to a cinema in the city to see Life of Pi but were unable to persuade a rickshaw driver to take them all the way back to the Dwarka suburb where the woman lived with her parents.

They were dropped halfway home, when a phone call from her mother asking her to hurry home prompted them to board an illegal bus with blacked out windows.

Mr Pandey confronted other passengers when they began insulting the pair but they soon produced iron rods, he said.

He said that he was beaten and fell to the floor of the bus.

After up to 20 minutes, the gang believed the student to have died and dumped the pair in the road
