A British Airways plane is undergoing inspections after it was forced to make two unscheduled landings in Ireland in three days.

On both occasions the Boeing 777 had to divert to Shannon Airport due to technical issues, according to the airline.

The latest incident occurred while the plane was transporting 220 passengers from Seattle to London Heathrow Airport on Sunday morning.

None of the passengers or crew was injured, and they were placed on a replacement flight that left Shannon Airport around six hours later.

The same plane was diverted to Shannon, on the west coast of Ireland, as it travelled from Heathrow to Boston on Friday night.

After being checked over, the plane continued its transatlantic journey to Boston.

The flight crew did not declare an emergency in either incident.

A British Airways spokeswoman said the first incident had occurred due to a ‘suspected technical issue’.

Of the second incident, the spokeswoman said: ‘Our flight diverted to Shannon due to a minor technical issue and our cabin crew looked after the customers on board.

‘Safety is always our first priority, and the aircraft diverted purely as a precaution.’
