A motorcyclist in Thailand has been given the shock of his life after he hit a car that sent him flying over the top of it and doing a flip.

A dash camera captured the action while uploader dashfoundnation was travelling down a street in the south-east Asian country.

The video posted on LiveLeak runs for 45 seconds but the crucial moments start at 23 seconds.

In the footage, a silver Honda sedan is seen cutting off the uploader's car while trying to enter a driveway.

While dashfoundnation stops his vehicle, a motorcyclist comes into view from the left side of the screen.

The bike has no time to stop as the sedan continues driving and does not seem to pause when the motorcyclist hits the back of the car.

On the point of impact, the bike rider does a flip over the car before landing on the ground.

Obviously shaken, the motorcyclist momentarily remains still.

The bike rider appears to be uninjured as he picks himself off the ground. 

It seems wearing a red protective helmet and a leather jacket helped him escape serious injury.
