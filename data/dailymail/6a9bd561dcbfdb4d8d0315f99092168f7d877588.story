It was supposed to be a picture for a private family album, but a photo of the Thomas family from Pennsylvania ended up being seen by millions of people globally after it was used in marketing campaigns by tens of different companies.

The issue might have gone unnoticed were it not for the fact the image was used by a local politician who was running for office and decide to use it in his own campaign.

Now the Chester family are aware of the viral leak but are struggling to have the picture  removed from websites around the world.

Fame at last? The Thomas family discovered their family photo had been used on websites around the world

Privacy settings: Thomas says she and the photographer never submitted the photo to any website or gave them permission to use the photo

Easy to find: A quick search on imgion.com for 'smiling family' turns up the Thomas' photo

Surprise: Kristen Thomas first learned about the problem when she was made aware that her family's photo was on a David Kessler's campaign ad that was mailed to voters

'We had photos online and never thought anything like this would happen,' Kristen Thomas told Eyewitness News.

It was only when David Kessler, a candidate for state representative in Pennsylvania's 130th district, used the picture, that the issue came to light.

Mr Kessler told Mrs Thomas that he obtained the photo from the free stock photo website imgion.com.

The part that couldn't be explained was that she and the photographer never submitted the photo to the website nor gave them permission to use the picture. 

She believes imgion.com stole the 2009 photo from her blog.

However, it wasn't just Kessler's campaign that was using the shot of her family and three young children, but tens of other websites on almost every continent. 

Without realizing it, the Thomas family's photo has become the face of advertisements selling apps, sunscreen, pet tracking devices, holiday cards, infertility drugs, cameras and vacations. 

MailOnline found more than 30 different websites that contained the family's photograph around the world including Turkey, Brazil, Iran, Portugal, Chile, Slovakia and Romania.

'A lot of the sites are in different languages. I don't know what we're selling!' said MrsThomas.

Global reach: The family's photo is on more than 30 websites in countries including Turkey, Brazil, Iran, Portugal, Chile, Slovakia and Romania

Family ties: The Thomas' are wondering how they can have the photo removed from all the websites

Mass appeal: The Thomas family's photo has become the face of advertisements selling a host of products from insurance...

...to family days out and holiday greeting cards

Now that the photo has gone viral there is not a lot the Thomas family can do.

Legal experts warn that anyone who uses a photo without the proper rights and permissions from the photo's owner could face legal consequences, especially if used for profit and commercial purposes.

However, the threat of legal action may not prove to be much of a deterrent especially to individuals like the Thomas' who don't have the backing of a large organization or legal network.

There is little that can be done to prevent others from taking pictures once they appear online without going down a long and costly legal road.

The Thomas' may struggle to have each and every one of the pictures that were used of their family taken down.

Many have suggested the best way to prevent your photos from being taken without permission is to not put them online in the first place 

Finding fault: Mrs Thomas believes imgion.com 'stole' the 2009 photo from her blog and then distributed it

Viral: Thomas says she and the photographer never submitted the photo to a stock photo website or gave any permission to use the photo

Picture this: Some of the sites are in different languages and it's not even clear what they are selling

Happy families: Experts say it is unlikely the family will ever be able to stop their photo being used
