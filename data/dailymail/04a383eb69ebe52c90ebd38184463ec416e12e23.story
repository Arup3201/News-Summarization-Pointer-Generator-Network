Girls aged 11 to 21 are as likely to have been harassed at school as on the street

Sexism has become so rife in everyday life that 75 per cent of schoolgirls say they are sexually harassed, while one in five 7-year-olds admit to having gone on a diet to conform to body image pressure.

Young women are bombarded with sexism - from being shouted at the in the street, to feeling pressured into losing weight, to experiencing hypocritical double standards in their sexual behaviour, a Girlguiding report warned.

Girls aged 11 to 21 are as likely to have been harassed at school as on the street, the survey found.

Young women also feel that their behaviour is judged by different standards to boys – 76 per cent say that girls are judged harshly for sexual behaviour that is deemed acceptable in boys.

But sexual harassment was not confined to unpleasant comments - the survey found the pressure of body image also damaged girls' self-esteem and confidence, and affected youngsters from the age of seven.

Among 11-to 21-year-olds, 80 per cent think there is too much discussion about women’s weight in the media and 71 per cent say they would like to lose weight.

Worrying, a fifth of girls of primary school age (7- to 11-year-olds) say they have been on a diet.

Girls also feel that their behaviour is judged by different standards to boys – 76 per cent say that girls are judged harshly for sexual conduct that is seen as acceptable in boys.

Daily experiences of sexism means that young women cannot escape harassment, as they are confronted with examples of it in school, online and in the street, the survey revealed.

One in five girls of primary school age (7- to 11-year-olds) say they have been on a diet (posed)

70 per cent report experiences of sexual harassment at school or ollege (13 to 21).

75 per cent think sexism affects most areas of their lives (11 to 21).

60 per cent have felt patronised or been made to feel stupid because of their sex (16 to 21).

87 per cent think women are judged more for their looks than ability (11 to 21).

76 per cent say girls are judged harshly for sexual behaviour seen as acceptable in boys (11 to 21).

54 per cent experience online abuse (11 to 21).

47 per cent are unhappy with their looks (11 to 16).

75 per cent feel boys want them to look like girls and women in the media (11 to 21).

71 per cent would like to lose weight (11 to 21).

Six in ten girls have had comments 
shouted at them about their appearance at school (60 per cent), and 62 
per cent have been shouted or whistled at in the street about their 
appearance (rising to 76 per cent of 16- to 21-year-olds).

Seven out of ten girls aged 13 and over report further experiences of sexual harassment at school or college.

These
include sexual jokes or taunts (51 per cent), seeing images of girls or
women that made them uncomfortable (39 per cent), seeing rude or 
obscene graffiti about girls and women (33 per cent), and unwanted 
sexual attention (28 per cent) and touching (28 per cent).

Sexual harassment and pressure followed children from the playground into online.

Harassment
and discrimination follow girls online, with experience of online 
bullying and abuse widespread. More than half of all those aged 11 to 21
say they have had negative experiences online (54 per cent).

For
older girls, aged 16 to 21, this includes having had sexist comments 
(26 per cent) and threatening things (25 per cent) said about or to 
them.

'Sexual harassment is 
commonplace, girls' appearance is intensively scrutinised and their 
abilities are undermined', a report from Girlguiding UK warns.

The report Equality for Girls is based on a survey of more than 1,200 girls and young women aged seven to 21.

Girlguiding UK chief executive Julie Bentley said it was a 'wake-up call' and that the issue urgently needed to be addressed.

'This cannot be dismissed as something that girls and young women just have to deal with as they grow up,' she said.

Girls needed to live in an equal society if they were to flourish and fulfil their potential to be leaders in all walks of life, added Ms Bentley.

Ms Bentley said: 'The findings show that girls feel that they experience high levels of sexism in their everyday lives - at school, online and in the media - and that this has a negative imapct on girls' confidence, wellbeing and, too often, their aspirations.

'Girls recognise that these inequalities are likely to have an impact on their future opportunities and curtail their choices.

The survey of a representative sample of girls and young women, both Guides and non-Guides, gives 'a disturbing insight into the state of equality for girls in the UK', says Girlguiding UK, which has more than half a million members.
