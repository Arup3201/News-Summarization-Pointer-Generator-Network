John Lewis have appointed a new set of 'little' product experts to help design a toys and interiors collection for little ones.

The so-called Little Panel consists of six 6 and 7 year olds who will help to shape the department store's Children's Rooms homeware range.

Three boys and three girls from East London's Maryland Primary School in Stratford, will name new product items as well as writing product descriptions which can be easily understood by children of the same age.

a duvet cover designed by the panelists, will now go into production ahead of going on sale in September of this year.

In addition, descriptions written by the panel will appear on product packaging and on the John Lewis website.

The children have also named four products, including Mr Sharky the shark bean bag and Tommy the toy monkey.

Omar Kamran, aged 6, who named the shark bean bag said: 'I always go shopping with my mum and dad and now I am part of it as my opinions count.'

Kai Prasal, aged 7, who has designed a new duvet cover, said: 'It's good giving toys names, because that's how they come alive.

'I like my rainbow design as it has got lots of bright colours and is nice to look at. It was very exciting and I feel very lucky to do it.'

The duvet cover, featuring a rainbow design, will be available online from September 2014.

Dr Pat Spungin, Child Psychologist said: 'Children start to assert their independence and individuality from a very young age.

'With toddlers it is often tantrums and saying no, but as children grow older they're more comfortable expressing their personality.

'One of the ways in which they can do this is by choosing how to decorate their own personal space, their bedroom. 

'Being able to choose among different furnishing styles, gives a child the feeling of independence and self-confidence that comes from making an important decision.'

Aleksandra Zivkovic-Buljcik, Teodora Buljcik's mother, said: 'It's fantastic to see a retailer such as John Lewis involving children in product decisions.

'Over the last few years Teodora has developed her own taste and interests, for example, she particularly likes owls, so is naturally drawn to products that include them.

'I believe it's important as a parent to listen to your child's opinion and let them express their creativity when decorating their own private space.

'Teodora thinks in her own way, and I try to nurture this. I encourage her choices as this is how she expresses her personality and what makes her special.'

Lorna 
Jackson, Head Teacher at Maryland Primary School, said: 'It has been a 
fantastic opportunity for the children, who have really enjoyed being 
involved.

'We
 see children develop their own personal taste at a young age, and we 
encourage them to express their personalities as much as possible.'

A John Lewis spokesperson said: 
'Children very much like to be involved in the design process of their 
rooms, and are naturally very creative. This year we decided to work 
with a small group of children to find out exactly what they want for 
their bedrooms. With the help from our 'Little Panel', we will aim to 
make buying children's homewares easier for parents and more fun for the
 kids themselves.'

The ongoing partnership will see children being being consulted for their input on new ranges and products. The children will not be paid but all of the Little Panel get to keep all the toys and products that they test - and of course full consent has been granted by all parents involved.

The project is been part of their art project, so hasn’t taken anytime out of their school day.

The initiative launched this week and will be piloted at the John Lewis Stratford store. The new duvet cover designed by the children can be found online from September 2014.
