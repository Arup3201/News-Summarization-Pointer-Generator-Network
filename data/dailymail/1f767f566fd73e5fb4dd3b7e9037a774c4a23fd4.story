From a potential heavyweight Champions League final clash to Rory McIlroy hoping to make history at the Masters in April.

And from the possibility of arguably the biggest boxing bout in history between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao, to the prospect of a Rugby World Cup on home soil - it's fair to say that 2015 is set to be another massive year in the world of sport.

Here, Sportsmail's reporters pick the golden ticket moments that they are hoping to see in the next 12 months.

MATT BARLOW

Imagine... the first Merszczeyside derby, with a Liverpool vs Everton shoot-out in the Europa League final in Warsaw and a place in the Champions League 2015/16 at stake, in the magnificent stadium where they forgot to close the roof when England played Poland in 2012 and had to delay the game for 24 hours.

ROB DRAPER

Real Madrid vs Bayern Munich, hopefully in the Champions League final in Berlin. 

Of course, if Chelsea can kick on and build on their domestic dominance, then it would be intriguing to see an English side take on Europe’s best. But the top two sides in the world right now look to be Real and Bayern – and they probably have the  two finest coaches as well.

Last year Carlo Ancelotti completely outwitted an uncharacteristically indecisive Pep Guardiola. This year Pep will be ready. One team boasts the core of the world champions while the other has Ronaldo, James and Bale. Toni Kroos and Xabi Alonso have swapped sides. When football clubs playing this well meet, the result ought to be something special.

DEREK LAWRENSON

It’s always a privilege to cover the Masters but it will be even more so next April with Rory McIlroy trying to win his third major in a row and become just the sixth golfer to complete the career Grand Slam at the age of just 25.

MIKE DICKSON

There is much to look forward to in 2015, which could see Rafael Nadal win the French Open for a staggering tenth  time. Or, given the uncertainties surrounding his health, it could be the year when Novak Djokovic defeats him there to complete his own collection of Grand Slams. If these two meet in Paris in the Springtime it will be one of the all-time heavyweight clashes in tennis.

JEFF POWELL

Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao in May, followed by the winner vs Amir Khan in September In boxing great things go in pairs. The world has waited seemingly an eternity to see the Money man and the PacMan in the richest fight in ring history. King Khan has been kept waiting ages to fight one of them. May they get it on, then on again in 2015.

RIATH AL-SAMARRAI

Mayweather-Pacquiao, even if it has taken far too long to make. The build-up would be immense but I suspect I'd struggle to get away from the thought that it should have happened four or five years ago. Neither man is the force he was, particularly Pacquiao, so whatever follows would come with a little regret. Would I want to miss it? No chance.

MARCUS TOWNEND

Treve’s attempt to become the first horse to win the Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe three times on the first Sunday of October at Paris racecourse Longchamp. 

Trainer Criquette Head-Maarek never lost faith in her wonder filly despite three defeats in the run-up to her emphatic second success under veteran jockey Thierry Jarnet, who had controversially replaced Frankie Dettori, No 1 jockey to Treve’s owner Sheik Joaan Al Thani. 

After the second Arc, Treve’s retirement was announced but the decision was reversed as Head-Maarek convinced the Sheik that Treve could make history.Plenty will be cheering her on and Longchamp, on the one day of the year the track comes alive, should be throbbing.

CHRIS CUTMORE 

Without meaning to go all Eddie Butler and prattle on pretentiously, rugby is a game that thrives on ancient and long-fought rivalries and Twickenham will be a seething pit of fire and song on September 29. 

Wales have recently made a habit of humiliating England in the Six Nations and it’s about time Chris Robshaw and Co wreaked their revenge on the grandest stage of all. Oh, and it’s time to teach them a lesson for trying to get the game staged in Wales too!

SIMEON GHOLAM 

Yes, he may have won it seven times before. And yes, he may have won 17 Grand Slams in total. But for Roger Federer to come so close to another Wimbledon title last July and fall to Novak Djokovic at the final hurdle was agonising to watch. 

To see old master lift the famous trophy just one more time in 2015 would be a fantastic moment that he deserves following his impressive resurgence in form. If not then I guess Andy Murray would do instead!.

JOE STRANGE

Rory McIlroy dominated golf in 2014 but nobody was as consistent at the majors as Rickie Fowler. The colourful American finished in the top five at the Masters, the Open, the US Open and the US PGA Championship but failed to lift a single trophy. 

Fowler took his game to a new level this year and has the potential to get even better next season. A major victory on home soil, ideally at Chambers Bay in June, would be ideal.

Rickie Fowler will be targeting his first major win next year after a breakthrough season in 2014
