As the ash cloud spewed into the sky by Japan's most active volcano settled this morning, residents in the nearby city of Kagoshima began the clear up - for the 500th time this year.

Sakurajima erupted last night, sending a plume of ash 5,000 metres into the air - the highest recorded since 1955 - shrouding the city in near-total darkness.

But today, the cloud lifted to reveal a blanket of grey dust that covered roads, cars, shops and homes.

Situated on the southern Japanese main island of Kyushu, the 1,117 metre (3,686 ft) volcano began erupting on the night of August 18, local time.

Shopkeepers, housewives and municiple workers emerged with brooms and masks to sweep the fine debris away.

But it may not be for the last time as volcanologists believe the mountain may spew out more ash this year than in the previous two decades.

Masato Iguchi, a professor at the Sakurajima Volcano Research Center, said 2012 saw a record number of eruptions.

Kyoto University’s disaster reduction research institute keeps close tabs on the volcano in order to avoid a repeat of its 1914 eruption, in which 58 people died.

That episode was the most powerful volcanic eruption to hit Japan in a hundred years.

At present, Sakurajima erupts on a small scale several thousand times a year, sending ash a few kilometres above its peak.
