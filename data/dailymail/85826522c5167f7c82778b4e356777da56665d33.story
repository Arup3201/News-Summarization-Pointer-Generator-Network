With alot of people walking around with an 8 megapixel camera embedded into their smart phone, it's easy to think you're something of an Annie Leibovitz or a Mario Testino.

Or at least try to be.

Now 54 people are being recognized for the photography skills they have managed photographers behind their iPhones.

Now in its seventh year, the iPhone Photography Awards (IPP AWARDS) have selected finalists from 17 countries - Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Mexico, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Kingdom and the United States - with a winner to be announced on June 15.

Thousands of submissions are sent in every year and winners of three separate categories are selected by a jury, and it costs $3.50 to submit a photo.

The finalists that were selected represent the best of different categories, such as architecture, art, flowers, children and, ofcourse, food.

The IPPA awards are not affiliated with apple, but the contest has been around almost as long as the iPhone itself.

The contest is divided in 16 categories: animals, architecture, children, flowers, food, landscape, lifestyle, nature, news/events, people, seasons, still life, sunset, travel, trees and others.

All entries will compete in one of the categories, as well as in the overall contest.

All entries compete for the prestigious IPP Photographer of the Year Award title, and the top 3 will receive a 16GB Wi-Fi iPad Mini.

The top entry from each of the 16 IPP categories will win a Gold Bar from the most recognizable private gold mint in the world.
