John Butler was jailed for seven years for manslaughter of his ex-partner Pauline

A businessman who appeared in a BBC reality show has been jailed for seven years for stabbing his estranged partner to death.

John Butler, 62, killed his former partner Pauline with a kitchen knife at the flat she had moved into in Leeds after their relationship began to fail. 

Leeds Crown Court heard he left her dying on the floor after she threatened to stop him from seeing his granddaughter and then returned home to drink a beer and smoke a cigar.

Butler was cleared of murder by a jury yesterday but had already admitted manslaughter.

Sentencing Butler today, the judge, Mr Justice Edis, said he did not accept Butler's argument that at no point did he intend to kill, pointing to the severity of the injuries he inflicted on Ms Butler. 

The jury had heard how the defendant and his family appeared in a 2012 episode of The Fixer, featuring Alex Polizzi.

The programme was about one of Butler's businesses - Kettley's Furniture, in Yeadon, Leeds.

Butler and his partner had been together for 30 years but had drifted apart after their three sons had grown up. 

Pauline Butler, 61, who took her partner's name despite never marrying him, went to live in a flat while Butler remained at the family home in Rawdon, Leeds.

On April 14 this year, Butler went round to the flat and after Ms Butler told him she hated him and asked him to leave, he stabbed his estranged partner in a 'sustained attack'.

The court also heard how on two occasions, rows between the couple had resorted to Pauline using a knife to threaten Butler, when he had to restrain her. 

The judge said he sentenced on the basis that the jury must have decided that Butler had suffered a 'loss of control' at the time of the attack.

He said he accepted that Ms Butler had been contemptuous in her comments to him as their relationship deteriorated and she had threatened him with a knife on three occasions. 

The judge said: 'People who wish to end their relationships and live alone without their former partner are entitled to do so without being killed. 

'It is clear that for nearly ten years you had been living increasingly separate lives under the same roof.

'You spent many nights in the pub and in your den drinking too much. 

'She was no doubt lonely and frustrated with what her life had become. 

'She came to despise you as a weak father and a drunk, and said frequently that she deserved better than you. 

'With a degree of cruelty she even said you were not a good father.

'This happened principally because you could not let go. The threat in relation to you granddaughter was the straw which broke the camel's back.'

'It was your view that your family life really was over that led to your loss of control.

'Your granddaughter was very important to you and in your desperate state the prospect of no longer going out with her overwhelmed you. That was a serious verbal threat to something you hold very precious.'

He added: 'In that state of mind you formed the intention to kill her. The evidence is not compelling because you say you cannot completely remember what happened.'

He added: 'I'm unable to say exactly how the knife ended up in your hand.'

'You drove the knife deep into her left shoulder and sliced into her neck in a deliberate motion and drove it into her right shoulder.

'I reject your your explanation this was accidental as you fell. Something happened in that room which you have not told us about.

'Had you not intended she would die you would have called an ambulance. Instead you took out the knife, washed it and took the dog back to the family home.

Miss Polizzi had tried to turn around the fortunes of the family's furniture store and funeral directors in Yeadon

When the family's business was featured in the show, the BBC programme said: 'Kettley's Furniture has been run by John Butler and his family for 33 years, but it just hasn't moved on in that time'

 'When your son Richard saw you, you said 'I think I've killed your mother'. I think you knew she was dead when you left her flat.'

Sending the disgraced boss down the cell, Justice Edis said: 'You have still not faced up squarely to what you did.'  

The couple's middle son, Richard, saw his father walk in with blood on his face, carrying a blood-stained orange towel

Butler stood with his head bowed as he was sentenced, sporting short dark hair and dark-rimmed glasses. He was wearing a grey suit with a light blue shirt and patterned blue tie. 

Detective Chief Inspector Steve Snow, of West Yorkshire Police, said Butler attacked his ex-partner 'sustained and violent attack' 

He said: 'John Butler has been convicted of killing of his long-term partner Pauline Butler, after she left him to embark on a new life without him

'After more than 40 years together Pauline decided to leave John, sadly this was something he could not come to terms with.

'On the morning of April 14, John Butler visited Pauline at her new home. It was whilst there that an argument developed.

'Mr Butler then armed himself with a large knife and carried out a sustained and violent attack on Pauline, which resulted in her immediate death.

'Pauline was devoted mother and grandmother and was loved by many. His actions that day have without doubt had a profound effect on all those who knew and loved Pauline.

'John Butler will now for the rest of his life have to live with the consequences of his actions that fateful morning.

'I hope that after today's sentencing, the family of Pauline can in some way start to rebuild and move on with their lives.'
