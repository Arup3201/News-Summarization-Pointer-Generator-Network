A Dallas elementary school teacher left her one-year-old daughter inside a hot car for hours on Friday and the child was later found dead. 

The mother, 42-year-old Vibha Marks of Balch Springs, was arrested late Friday on a charge of second-degree felony child abandonment, according to the Dallas Police Department. 

Her daughter, Victoria, had just celebrated her first birthday on Thursday.

Marks works as a teacher at Frank Guzick Elementary School. A high school senior who works part time at the elementary school as a teacher's aide discovered the child inside Marks' locked car around 1:20 p.m. Friday, according to the Dallas Morning News. 

'I looked over and saw that there was a baby in there,' Exenia Gomez told the newspaper. 'I looked at the baby and she wasn’t moving. She had dried bubbles on her face and her eyes were still looking down.'

Gomez called 911, and the operator told her to remove the child from the car and perform CPR. 

Since the doors were locked, Gomez used a piece of wood to break into the vehicle. She picked up the baby from her car seat and could tell she wasn't breathing. She began performing CPR. 

Paramedics arrived on the scene and the baby was transported to Baylor University Medical Center, where she was pronounced dead.

Temperatures on Friday had reached 86 degrees, but the air inside the vehicle where the baby was locked was even warmer. 

An autopsy will determine her exact cause of death. 

School officials released a statement Friday saying that Marks had been placed on administrative leave pending the police investigation. 

'Obviously, this is a very tragic situation,' the statement said. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with the teacher and her family at this time, as well as the staff at Guzick Elementary.'
