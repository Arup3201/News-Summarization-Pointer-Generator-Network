Efe Ambrose will fly out to join his Celtic team-mates in Maribor on Wednesday – after Parkhead chiefs omitted the defender from their Champions League squad for fear of a Legia Warsaw-style administration blunder.

The Nigerian international had been sent-off in the 4-1 first leg defeat to the Polish champions in the last qualifying round and was suspended for the return at Murrayfield.

But with Legia’s 2-0 win wiped out for fielding a suspended player, Celtic had been concerned that Ambrose’s punishment had therefore not been served.

There also appears to have been confusion as to whether the player had been served with a one or two-match ban.

The central defender was absent from the Celtic party which left Glasgow airport for Slovenia on Tuesday morning but a belated call to UEFA headquarters in Nyon has confirmed the defender is eligible to play.

Blaming ‘communication problems’ for the mix-up, coach Ronny Deila said: ‘Efe didn’t travel today, he is coming tomorrow morning.

‘In the beginning there were some communication problems, if he was ready or not. We didn’t think he was ready because he got two matches but in the end it was one match.

‘So he is coming now and I am very happy because we need defenders.’

Deila admitted Celtic are unlikely to secure the signature of Ghana winger Wakaso Mubarak in time for tonight’s crucial tie.

The champions were hoping a 12-month loan deal could be done ahead of Tuesday night’s 11pm signing deadline but the former Stromsgodset boss said: ‘It is going on but it doesn’t seem like there is going to be anything today. It is hard to get the paperwork together.

‘I am not 100 per cent sure but I think it is going to be hard to have him ready for the game against Maribor.’

Deila has challenged his Celtic side to prove they are more than Champions League lucky losers. Well beaten over two legs against Legia, an improbable reprieve has dovetailed with convincing league wins over St Johnstone and Dundee United.

And the Norwegian told his side to show they deserve to stay in the Champions League.

‘I think everybody wants to prove that,’ said Deila. ‘They want to still be in the Champions League and I think the players really want it.

‘I think against Legia there were a lot of players who wanted it too much. And I have to say there were a lot of new things going on which took their energy.

‘But we played a good game on Saturday and they look good in training as well.

‘If we perform well we will get our results, if we don’t then we will not reach the next stage. So the performance has to be much better than it was against Legia.

‘If we come away from here with a good result then we’ll have the crowd behind us at Celtic Park for the next game and everyone knows how much that means.’

Mubarak’s likely absence follows injuries to James Forrest, Adam Matthews and Aleksander Tonev, denying Deila options in wide areas.

But the Parkhead boss said of the impending arrival: ‘He will be an important player to have in the squad as well because James (Forrest) is out and we will need him.

‘He can play both sides and can also play as a No8 in a 4-3-3.’

The recipient of 18 yellow cards and two reds while with Espanyol before he joined Rubin Kazan, the 24-year-old’s temperament has been called into question.

‘I haven’t thought about that but I know African players,’ added Deila. ‘They adapt when they live in Europe – he is not coming straight from Africa.

‘He played for a time in Russia.

‘African players sometimes come from tough backgrounds. The first year or two in Europe can be difficult for them.’

Celtic are also in the market for a striker but Deila said there is no panic over the likely failure to secure a £1.8million deal for Stoke’s Cameron Jerome.

‘We have been trying hard to sign one but I don’t sign players if I’m not sure about them. I have to be sure,’ he insisted.

‘The worst thing is to sign a player now and find out later that he’s not as good as we hoped. When you go into the last two weeks of the transfer window suddenly something very good can happen.

‘The biggest clubs with the biggest budgets are still not finished signing players. At the end they have to get rid of people.

‘So I will keep my money and make sure we spend it right. The last 14 days is the most important part of the window. I have a good feeling we are doing the right things. It feels right in my stomach.’
