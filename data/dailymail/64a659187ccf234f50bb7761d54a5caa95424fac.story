A box of ammunition that dropped out of a helicopter during military exercises overnight was found Thursday in the Miami-Dade area.

The training practices were taking place throughout Miami-Dade and Broward counties, and are a joint effort between the local law enforcement and the military.

According to police, Black Hawk helicopters were flying over Northwest Miami-Dade Wednesday night as part of a training session when a metallic box containing ammunition fell out of one of the aircraft.

Oops! A metallic box of ammunition (similar to the one pictured) dropped out of a military helicopter as it was flying over Miami-Dade and Broward counties overnight 

The container was located in northwest Miami-Dade this afternoon. There is no word at this time on the contents of the box or the exact location where it touched down.

'Pursuant to a search, the ammunition was located in northwest Miami-Dade County without incident. The military exercises will continue as planned. No further information will be released at this time,' the US Army said in a statement released Thursday.  

Officials were asking anyone who may have come in contact with the missing box to call 911 immediately.

People were urged not to handle or move the ammo box, and wait for law enforcement officials to safely secure it.

‘As in all training exercises, the safety of service members and the local community is top priority, and every precaution will be taken to mitigate risks for the safety of all,’ Miami-Dade police said in a statement.
