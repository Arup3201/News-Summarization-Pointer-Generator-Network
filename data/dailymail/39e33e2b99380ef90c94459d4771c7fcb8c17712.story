If you fancy living closer to your local train station, then this residence could be just the ticket.

A home in the heart of the Snowdonia mountain range converted from one of Britain's sleepiest stations has gone on sale for £450,000 - but it's so quiet that you have to flag down passing trains.

Just three travellers a day use one of the 12 services going through Roman Bridge station in North Wales, which lies on the Arriva railway line between Blaenau Ffestiniog and Llandudno Junction.

Unusual: Estate agents said that the home will appeal to a train lover who wants to be his own station master

Passing service: The station was built in 1879 by North Western Railway to accommodate the station master

Estate agents selling the three-bedroom home at the station said that it will appeal to a train lover who wants to be his own station master - and bring up his offspring like the Railway Children.

Estate agent Martyn Haden said: ‘It is just the ticket for anyone who had a model railway while growing up. It's very handy for commuters - just step out the door and you are on the platform.

‘But you have to stick your hand out to stop the train, a bit like being at a bus stop. It's a unique property in an incredibly beautiful location - whoever buys it will be chuffed to bits.’

Part of the 10 acres of land that comes with the station borders the Rivor Lledr, where the new owner will be able to fish for salmon, sea-trout and wild brown trout.

The station was built in 1879 by North Western Railway to accommodate the station master and his family. The line was originally put in to provide transport for farmers and slate quarry workers.

But these days the station sees just the odd villager and tourist on its stone-paved platform. In 2012, just 936 passengers used the station, making Roman Bridge the third quietest station in all of Wales.

Owner Roger Latham, 66, bought the property from the station master's widow in 1997. He carried out refurbishment on the detached house, installing solar panels and a sustainable heating system.

Conservationist Mr Latham rented the house as a holiday home to keen walkers and outdoor types keen to experience Snowdonia.

He said: ‘l'll be sad to see it go, but I do only live down the road. I'm getting a bit long in the tooth these days, so it was time to find a new owner.

‘I just hope whoever purchases it recognises what a beautiful part of the world this is.

'The rural life is a very tranquil one and I think whoever buys it will be very happy with the location.’
