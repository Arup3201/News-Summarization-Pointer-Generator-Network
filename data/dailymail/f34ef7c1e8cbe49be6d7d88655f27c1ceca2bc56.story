Koalas may be best known for being cute and cuddly, even borderline benign creatures, but even they have days when their temper is tested. 

Rare footage of two of the native Australian marsupials in the world having a tiff was posted by Swedish tourist Elin Nordlander on YouTube and went viral with more than 2.5million views and counting.

The two adorable creatures are filmed laconically coming to blows, with one appearing to be affectionate while the other isn't impressed, under a tree at Great Otway National Park in Victoria.

Serious face: The two koalas look sternly at each other before coming to blows at their own pace

During the video the koala on the left looks disgruntled and while the koala on the right appears to try to patch things up, but gets a clip around the ear and a gentle bit near the face. 

When the one on the right fights back, the other koala seems to be taken aback and till the same dance is repeated with both making their distinctive wailing or grunting sound. 

Distance: The koala on the right appears as if he is trying to move closer to the other koala 

Tension: As the koala on the right makes advances the koala on the left howls aggressively

Midway through the footage the amused cameraman turns the camera on himself to show his amusement as he watches the drama unfold. 

He smiles into the camera for a few moments before turning the camera back to the irritable koalas.

While a large amount of koala habitats in Australia are being decimated, Great Otway is renowned for its healthy population of the eucalypt leave-loving creatures.
