Battling out of his seat, Benjamin Levy's ribs hurt so much he thought they were broken, but what struck him most about seconds after Asiana Flight 214 came to a shuddering halt on the tarmac of San Francisco airport was the silence.

None of the flight attendants could be found directing the 291 injured and terrified passengers off the stricken Boeing 777, no one from the cockpit announced anything - and now previously unseen pictures taken by Levy in the confused aftermath have been released by the Associated Press.

Ignoring his pain, Levy, 39, rushed to the escape door by his seat above one of the battered wings and opened it and he began to direct the evacuation of the aircraft which just moments before had crash landed - losing its entire tail section.

'We were left on our own,' said Mr. Levy to the New York Times. 'There was no message from the pilot, from the crew - there was no one.'

Levy ushered up to 40 passengers out of the escape door, despite the fact that the emergency sliding chute had not deployed on his side of the plane.

The wheels of the aircraft had been snapped off as the plane hit a seawall on its approach - making it easy for those able to help themselves to lower down onto the tarmac of the runway.

Deciding not to exit the Boeing 777 through that exit, Levy, who as an international businessman is a frequent flyer, moved to the back of the plane where a gaping hole now existed where the tail section used to be.

He moved past luggage which had rained down on seats and he saw a woman whose leg was trapped by a seat - forced loose of its rivets as the plane almost barreled over as it came to a jarring halt.

'She couldn't move,' said Levy to the New York Times. 'There were two other guys. We couldn't pick her up.'

A firefighter who had rushed onto the plane without thought for his safety appeared and ordered Levy and the last remaining passengers who could walk off the plane, which had now burst into flames.

'People were pushing each other out. There was a lot of commotion. We got pretty much everyone in the back section of the plane out. I'm so thankful so many people go out of the plane quickly.'

Having landed at San Francisco many times before, Levy told NBC Bay Area that he knew the approach was wrong.

As has transpired, this was pilot Lee Kang-kooks first landing at San Francisco in a Boeing 777 and in total he had logged only 43 hours flying time in the aircraft, despite being an experienced Boeing 747 pilot.

'When he realized that, he put more gas to try to correct the plane again and it was too late,' Levy recalled in a phone interview with NBC Bay Area. 'So we hit the runway pretty bad and then we starting going back up in the air again. And then we landed again pretty hard.

'It felt like the guy missed the runway quite completely. He tried to correct, which probably helped. We would have hit the rocks.'

As the plane's belly skidded along the runway, Levy described the sheer terror inside.

'It was surreal,' Levy said. 'A lot of people screaming and not really believing what was happening to them. I wasn’t believing it either.'

Taken to San Francisco General Hospital, Levy was treated for cuts and bruises and later reunited with his family.

'I am in pain, but not too bad compared to other people,' he said, adding on Twitter of his actions, 'Just did what anyone in my position would have done.'

Despite Levy's assertion that the crew were nowhere to be found, the bravery of cabin manager Lee Yoon-hye, the last person to leave the burning plane has been praised.

Another flight attendant put a scared elementary schoolboy on her back and slid down a slide and one of the four pilots helped another injured flight attendant off the plane after the passengers escaped.

Lee herself worked to put out fires and usher passengers to safety, despite suffering a broken tailbone that she didn't know she had until she was finally treated at San Francisco hospital later.

While it is a miracle that 305 of the 307 passengers and crew of Asiana Flight 214 survived, it is 'most likely' that one of the the two Chinese teens who died were hit by an emergency vehicle rushing to the burning plane.

While a fire department spokeswoman said this on Monday, authorities are not saying if it was Ye Meng Yuan and Wang Linjia, both 16, who suffered the tragic accident.

'The incident commander was notified by one of the chiefs on the field that it appeared that there was a possibility that one of the deceased had been hit by one of the fire vehicles,' Mindy Talmadge, a spokeswoman for the San Francisco Fire Department, said yesterday in an interview with Bloomberg.

'Most likely it was a fire vehicle, but everything is still kind of up in the air until the investigation is complete.'

And it has been revealed today that six of the 29 students on the flight who were headed to California as part of a summer camp are now stuck in limbo as their passports were destroyed in the crash.

Indeed, the tour organizer, Adam Yu believes that the entire camp will be scrapped and the children will return to China in the next few days.

'The students and parents are missing each other,' he said to the Daily Beast. 'They need a few days to recover. They’re very emotional. It’s best for them to take a few days’ rest before sending them on an airplane again. It would be scary for them.

'They were shocked. They’re afraid to take an airplane right away.'
