England have the biggest representation on a 12-strong shortlist announced by tournament organisers for this season's RBS 6 Nations player of the tournament.

Centre Jonathan Joseph, fly-half George Ford, scrum-half Ben Youngs and No 8 Billy Vunipola all feature among the group.

England, despite beating France 55-35 two days ago, were pipped to the title by Ireland, with Wales finishing third.

Three Ireland players make the list - captain Paul O'Connell, centre Robbie Henshaw and scrum-half Conor Murray - together with Welshmen Alun-Wyn Jones and Dan Biggar, Scots Stuart Hogg and Jonny Gray, and Italy captain Sergio Parisse.

Surprise omissions, though, include Wales captain Sam Warburton and his team-mate Leigh Halfpenny, plus France wing Yoann Huget.

Throughout the tournament, players were awarded (or deducted) points based on statistical performance across different categories.

Six Nations analysts weighted the importance of different actions, depending on different positions, with those categories then collated to give each player an overall performance score.

Public voting via the official Six Nations website closes at midnight on Wednesday.Â
