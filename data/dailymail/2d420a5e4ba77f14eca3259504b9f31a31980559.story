Manchester United and Barcelona will battle it out to sign Dutch international Daley Blind this summer.

Reports in Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo suggest new Barcelona boss Luis Enrique is keen on bringing the utility man to the Nou Camp ahead of the new season.

However, according to Mundo Deportivo, the La Liga giants will face competition from Manchester United as Louis van Gaal has identified Ajax's Blind - who is valued at 22million euros (£17.4million) - as a player he would like to bring to Old Trafford.

Blind's ability to play at left-back or as a defensive midfielder would make the 24-year-old a good addition to Manchester United's squad.

Former Barcelona boss Van Gaal will be looking to sign a new left-back to provide cover for summer signing Luke Shaw as veteran defender Patrice Evra looks set to join Juventus.

News of Michael Carrick's injury may also lead to Van Gaal stepping up his interest and beating Barcelona to a player he worked with during his time with the Dutch national team.
