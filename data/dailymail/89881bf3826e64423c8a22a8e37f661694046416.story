Convicted rapist Ched Evans returned to an ordinary life after he was photographed out shopping in Cheshire's Alderley Edge.

The former Sheffield United striker - who served half of a five-year sentence before being released from prison last week - was accompanied by supportive girlfriend Natalie Massey.

The 25-year-old made a beeline for his car while carrying a number of bags filled with groceries from a local supermarket.

His girlfriend remained close by Evans' side, after leading a campaign to have his conviction overturned in a case review.

His former club is split over whether the £3million striker should be re-signed, it has been claimed.

The Blades denied rumours he was set to be offered a new two-year contract worth £500,000 following his release - but admitted they were continuing to 'deliberate' on a decision.

But on Saturday it was reported that the club's board was divided over whether to let the disgraced Welsh striker play for them again.

Evans' has maintained his innocence despite being found guilty of raping a 19-year-old woman in his home town of Rhyl, North Wales, insisting it was ‘consensual and not rape’.

The Sun quotes a source as saying: 'Club bosses seem to think having Ched back is the right thing. They want to help rehabilitate him.

'But some of the board are still uneasy. They could still be a few weeks away from making public their decision.'

The newspaper reports that the club have declined to comment further.

Last week co-chairmen Kevin McCabe and Jim Phipps issued a joint statement denying reports that they have offered Evans a new contract.

They described the reports as 'false and damaging to the club' but added: 'We have made a statement on this matter previously and the lack of credibility and substance from this latest media report does not warrant any expansion from previous comments apart from noting that we are continuing to deliberate on any long term decision about Ched Evans.' 

It was reported that an online petition against Evans returning to Sheffield United had gained more than 150,000 signatures.

Evans broke his silence for the first time on Wednesday to apologise to his girlfriend, 25.

But he was criticised for not mentioning his victim - who had previously been named by trolls on Twitter and forced to change her name as a result.

In the statement he said he has 'constantly regretted my act of infidelity and the damage that has been done on so many fronts because of it'.

He added: 'It is a rare and extraordinary privilege to be permitted to play professional football. Now that I've served the custodial part of my sentence of two and a half years, it is my hope that I will be able to return to football.

But he said he was 'determined to continue to fight to clear my name' and has now submitted his case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission.
