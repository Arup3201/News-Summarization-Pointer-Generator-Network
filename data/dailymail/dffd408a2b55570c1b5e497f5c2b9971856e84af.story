Little Mix singer Perrie Edwards, 20, is engaged to One Direction band member Zayn Malik, 21. When the couple announced their engagement in August last year several One Direction fans threatened to harm Perrie for marrying their idol

'All I have to do is track down Perrie Edwards, cut off her head with a rusty chainsaw, marry Zayn and have all his babies.'

The
 character insisted she was the 'ultimate Directioner' and unveiled a 
tattoo on her back of Zayn and bandmates Harry Styles, Niall Horan, 
Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne.

The episode also saw fans of the 
Little Mix star taking to Twitter to voice their concern, with some 
complaining directly to the BBC.

One
 fan tweeted: 'I think what that girl said about Perrie in Holby City 
was awful. I know it's only a TV show but I don't see how the BBC even 
allowed it!'

Another 
wrote:'The worse thing about what was said about perrie in holby city,is
 that by an actress saying it is saying that it's ok for others to say 
it.'

One user replied to Perrie's mother: 
'Debbie I cant believe they said that :( I made an official complaint 
they cant get away with such a nasty comment.'

Another, Jade, wrote: 'Complaint sent to @BBCOne about what was said about Perrie in Holby City. Disgusting!'

The BBC said it had received about 30 official complaints so far.

A spokesman said: 'The line Â­referencing Perrie Edwards was made to emphasise the character Kayleighâ€™s devotion to One Â­Direction

'It was absolutely not intended to be taken seriously and clearly in the context is not intended to cause offence.'

When
 the couple announced their engagement in August last year several One 
Direction fans threatened to harm Perrie for marrying their idol.

Neither Perrie or Zayn have made reference to the reports on their Twitter accounts.

Last year Holby City was accused 
of risking lives with a 'reckless' portrayal of organ donation - 
prompting potential life savers to come off the donor list.

Five
 million viewers watched an August episode which centred on a 
heart-swap plot about a brain dead teenage girl and another who needed a
 transplant.

But NHS Blood 
and Transplant, which is responsible for organ donation, criticised 
the episode which bosses say was full of inaccuracies.
