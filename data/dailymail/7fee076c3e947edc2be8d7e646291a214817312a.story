Mario Balotelli has a reputation as a joker - but it seems he feels he is more like another Batman villain, Bane.

The Liverpool forward posted a picture on Instagram of himself in a mask and referenced Bane in a hashtag.

And after failing to impress against the Villans last week, Balotelli was a hero in midweek against Ludogorets, scoring his first Liverpool goal, and will look to the bane of West Ham's defenders' lives at Upton Park on Saturday.

Liverpool star Mario Balotelli is up to his usual tricks as he masks up in this Instagram post 

Balotelli's mask resembles the look of Batman villain Bane in 'The Dark Knight Rises' film from 2012

Bane is a super-villain who appears in the Batman comics and films. He was most recently played by Tom Hardy in the 2012 film The Dark Knight Rises. He is an escpaed convict who has abnormal strength and is one of Batman's most challenging foes. He became known as 'The Man Who Broke the Bat' when he broke Batman's back. 

Brendan Rodgers has hailed the forward's attitude and work rate since he joined Liverpool and says he will only improve.

‘You saw his work rate. He’s put his body on the line and he needs to do more of that but I think that will come as he gets fitter. 

'But he’s well in tune with the history of the club. I think you can see what he’s trying to put in for the team. That’s going to be very important.

‘The crowd demand that as the players who’ve been here in the past in that position have been non-stop and he’s becoming attuned to that. He’s aware of the demands and it’s going to take time but if he continues to score goals and work hard, he will be fine as he has got the quality.’
