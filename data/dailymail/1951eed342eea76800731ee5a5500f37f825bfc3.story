They are not the photos that any parents would ever want to take.

But the mothers and father of these youngsters hope that by sharing them, they will raise awareness of the gruelling journey cancer has taken them on.

They posted the heart-rending pictures of their children before, during and after their treatment on a designated Facebook page in a bid to show what their children have been through.

The photos of children, being treated on
 Ward 84 at Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital (RMCH), were shared in 
response to the ‘no make-up selfie’ trend sweeping the internet.

The parents feared that make-up free selfies could trivialise cancer and wanted to show how the disease really affects people.

The page, which tells the stories of 60 patients, has already had more than 4,700 ‘likes’.

Heartfelt tributes have also been left to children who passed away from the disease.

The aim of the page is also to raise money for the RMCH charity and other causes supporting children with cancer.

Eleanor Massey, 30, was one of the parents who came up with the idea for the page.

The parents were inspired to set up the Facebook page by the 'no make-up selfie craze' which they felt trivialised the disease. Image shows Josh, three, who had lymphoma

Her son Jacob, three, was treated on Ward 84 after being diagnosed with leukaemia in December 2013 and is now in remission.

Ms Massey, said: ‘We’ve always had a Facebook group for people whose children are being treated on Ward 84 and a lot of people were offended by the ‘no make-up selfie’ thing.

‘They were concerned people were just posting photos but not understanding they also had to make a donation to cancer charities.

‘We wanted to show the real face of cancer and have also asked people to describe their child’s symptoms as lots of parents want to know what to look out for.

‘We hope by letting people into our world a bit we can raise awareness of childhood cancers and raise money for charities who have helped us.’

The Facebook page is also designed to raise money for children's cancer charities. Image shows Euan who was diagnosed with Ewing's sarcoma - a type of bone cancer - in 2003 at the age of four

Clair Beswick’s daughter Lily was also treated on Ward 84 - but sadly passed away eight months after being diagnosed with soft tissue cancer rhabdomyosarcoma at just one year old.

Ms Beswick, who lives in Bolton, said: ‘It’s good that it raised so much money but I found the no make-up selfie thing quite indulgent. This is our way of raising awareness of cancer.’

Sarah Naismith, head of charities for RMCH, said: ‘The Faces of Ward 84 page is inspiring and heart-breaking in equal measure and we applaud the bravery of the patients’ families in sharing their stories.’
