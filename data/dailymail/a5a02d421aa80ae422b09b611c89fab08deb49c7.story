A Second World War bomb discovered under one of Germany's busiest autobahns has  blown a 65ft hole in the road after it exploded.

Bomb disposal experts were forced to carry out a controlled explosion after being unable to defuse the 1,000lb British shell which was unearthed during construction work.

Repairs are now in progress on the eastbound carriageway of the Autobahn A3 near Offenbach, central Germany, with police saying they are unsure when the section of road will reopen. Drivers have been allowed back on to the westbound carriageway 

The road had to be closed while the explosion was carried out, causing 12 miles of traffic jams in both directions this morning, according to The Local. 

Frankfurt airport was also closed as the bomb was discovered directly underneath its main flight path, causing 22 planes to be delayed.

The Autobahn 3 was closed in both directions near Offenbach this morning, causing traffic jams that stretched for 12 miles in both directions

Frankfurt airport was also closed until the detonation was complete as the explosive was discovered underneath one of its main flight paths

Police have now reopened the westbound carriageway towards Frankfurt, but say they don't know when the eastbound section will be open to motorists

Officers cordoned off a 1,000 metre radius around the bomb evacuating 160 people from their homes in southern Offenbach earlier today
