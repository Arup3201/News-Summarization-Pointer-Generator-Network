Two illegal immigrants face jail after 
being found guilty of using a money transfer service to con customers 
out of almost £50,000.

Syed Bukhari, 25, and Siyed Asem, 58, ran the legitimate service from a corner shop they set up in Gloucester.

But when customers entrusted them with their cash they skimmed hundreds 
of pounds a time off the top of the sums. They also offered made up 
exchange rates and pocketed the difference.

All the while they were staying in the country illegally as 'overstayers' because their visas had expired.

The court heard how the two men set up the shop selling sweets and food as a way to make a living.

But soon they began offering the entirely legal money transfer service to customers with relatives in the Indian sub-continent.

In all, dozens of customers sending cash to relatives India and Bangladesh were fleeced by the crooks.

The pair pleaded guilty at Gloucester crown court to the scam.

Bukhari admitted 11 offences of fraud in that between January and March this year that he made false representations to customers, that his money transfer business was in a sound financial position and that money would be transferred at a preferential rate of exchange.

Asem admitted 12 similar charges.

Lisa Hennessy, prosecuting, said Bukhari was responsible for £33,688 of the total fraud and Asem £14,518.

'They ran a corner shop. One person paid over two sums of £5,000 - a total of £10,000 - and has lost it.'

Judge Jamie Tabor QC asked 'Where has all the money gone?'

'There is none left,' said Mrs Hennessy. 'We say their total criminal benefit was £51,000 but they have no assets left.

'The money has been used to keep the cashflow going in the shop.

'Everything seems to have been fine between last October and January when money was being transferred. But from January on it starts to fall apart and it is clear that the money has been used to keep things going and they have spent it.

'There doesn’t appear to be any money left. Fifty thousand pounds has gone in two and a half months.'

Sabhia Pathan, defending, said Asem - who was assisted in court by an Urdu interpreter - has already been declared bankrupt.

'Both men are overstayers and both have been served with deportation papers,' she said.

'Mr Asem has significant health difficulties.'

Judge Tabor said: 'That’s why he came to this country in the first place.'

The judge said he would want to know how the two men were able to set up a corner shop if they were overstayers and had no legal status in this country.

The judge remanded Bukhari in custody and Asem on bail for pre-sentence reports.

But he warned them both to expect prison sentences when they return to court on August 10.
