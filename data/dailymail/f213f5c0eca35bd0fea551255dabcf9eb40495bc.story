Barcelona striker Luis Suarez says biting is 'like an impulse' and that he is in now on the 'right path' after seeking help.

The Uruguay forward is set to make his competitive debut against Real Madrid on Saturday night after serving a four-month ban for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 World Cup.

Suarez has admitted he has a problem and told The Guardian: 'It is like an impulse, like a reaction.

'I think all the bad things I have been through are in the past. I believe I am on the right path now, dealing with the people who can help me, the right kind of people.

'Everyone has different ways of defending themselves. In my case, the pressure and tension came out in that way.

'There are other players who react by breaking someone's leg, or smashing someone's nose across their face. What happened with Chiellini is seen as worse. I understand why biting is seen so badly.'

Suarez's confession emerges as Barcelona manager Luis Enrique confirmed earlier on Friday that the striker will play in Saturday's El Clasico at the Bernabeu.

'Suarez will get minutes but I can't say how many,' said Enrique. 'This is a great chance for him to incorporate himself in the team. How many minutes he will get I can't say.'

Chiellini became the third victim in Suarez's  career after the controversial striker served previous bans for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal in 2010 and Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic in 2013.

Suarez moved to Barcelona from Liverpool for £75million during the summer, and was initially banned from all football-related activity by FIFA.

An appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, however, ruled that last season's Premier League top goalscorer was allowed to train with his new team-mates and play in Barcelona friendlies.

The game against Real will be Suarez's first competitive match since Uruguay's 1-0 defeat against Italy on June 24.
