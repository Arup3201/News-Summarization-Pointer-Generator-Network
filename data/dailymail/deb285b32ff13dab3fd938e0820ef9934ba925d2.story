Trying to reduce the time their children spend on laptops and smartphones is a constant worry for parents.

But perhaps they should encourage them to remain glued to their devices, as computer scientists have emerged as the top-earning graduates.

According to figures of graduate salaries, computer scientists from Oxford receive the most lucrative pay packets after graduating, earning an average of £43,895 six months after leaving university.

Google co-founder Larry Page (pictured) studied computer science at Stanford University - he is now worth $31.7billion 

Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg read computer science at Harvard and is now worth $33.1b

The figure is almost four times that of graduates in drama, dance and cinematics from Essex University, the lowest earners on just £11,963.

Professor Michael Wooldridge (pictured) attributed the success of his graduates to an 'uncompromising insistence on mathematical clarity' 

Famous graduates of computer science include Google co founder, Larry Page, and Facebook co-founder, Mark Zuckerberg.  

Professor Michael Wooldridge, head of the computer science department at Oxford University, told Sian Griffiths, of the Sunday Times: 'Ultimately, our students are trained to think clearly, rigorously and deeply about complex problems.' 

'Computers are the future and computer science courses command a salary premium', agreed Professor Alan Smithers, of Buckingham University.  

The tables also highlight the growing gap between the highest and lowest earning graduates and found that one in 10 had not got a job six months after leaving university.   

Graduates in computer science from Imperial College London and Cambridge also feature in the top 10 for earnings. 

Science degrees are increasingly the path to higher earnings, the figures reveal, with engineering, medicine, veterinary science and dentistry all performing well. Arts subjects fare far less well.

Elsewhere, the figures show there is a significant difference in pay depending on which university students attend. 

Graduates in accounting and finance from Huddersfield received an average of £16,335, while students reading the same subject at Bath earned £29,588.
