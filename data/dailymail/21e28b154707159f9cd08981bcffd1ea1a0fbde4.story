Surprising splits within UEFA now make it highly unlikely that the world’s most powerful football confederation will put up a candidate to stand against Sepp Blatter for the FIFA presidency.

UEFA had insisted they would field a challenger even if Michel Platini decided, as he did in Monaco last week, to continue for another term as European football’s kingpin.

But that ambition was defeated during a meeting of the 54 European countries in Monte Carlo when a number of delegates - notably from Finland and Iceland - made it clear they were happy with the way Blatter and FIFA were running the world game.

Unchallenged: With splits in UEFA it's unlikely the the confederation will put up a challenger for Sepp Blatter

Happy where he is: Michel Platini has confirmed he wants to stay head of UEFA and not challenge Blatter

Some of the Euro powerbrokers who might have put themselves forward were already disillusioned by what happened before the FIFA Congress in June. Then, the UEFA countries agreed to vote for age and term restrictions for the FIFA presidency but when the FIFA vote took place, only 33 of the 54 nations actually backed the limits. As a result, none of Europe’s big hitters would want to oppose Blatter when not even assured of full support within UEFA.

Meanwhile, the sight of Platini chilling out at the beach bar at the Meridien Plaza in Monaco after completing his Champions League draw duties helped explain why he is content to run European football for another four years rather than dip his toe in the murkier Zurich waters.

Trigger-happy Leeds owner Massimo Cellino is understood to have contacted Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid to ask about his assistant Paul Clement as a possible manager at Elland Road. 

However, the conversation didn’t last long after Cellino was told that Clement, who turned down West Bromwich, is earning nearly £2million a year in Spain.

Martin Johnson, who has kept well out of the limelight since presiding over England’s Rugby World Cup debacle in 2011, is now prepared to take a higher profile, judging by his brief appearance in the ER 2015 promotional film for their public ticket sale campaign. 

However, if you blink, you will miss Johnson’s nod during a motivational speech by actor Charles Dance in the Twickenham dressing room.

Sky Sport’s ludicrous hyping of presenter Jim White as the king of their transfer coverage was exposed in their deadline-day promo. 

It showed White supposedly taking a phone call from QPR manager Harry Redknapp, saying: ‘Harry - what have you got for me?’ 

The Redknapp camp understandably objected to Harry being presented as a prime source for White’s often wayward transfer gossip and the greeting was changed to ‘Hello - what have you got for me?’

FA’s Burton U-turn

One upshot of the FA’s assessment of their World Cup debacle is a change of attitude over England’s use of St George’s Park before internationals.

Instead of staying there before every game, which had been the plan, the senior team will now only be based at SGP when it suits, with the players not relishing the 130-mile journey from Burton to Wembley.

So England will again stay at the Grove Hotel outside Watford before Wednesday’s friendly against Norway, prompting the question of why they built their £100m national training centre deep in the Staffordshire countryside.

Meanwhile, sports psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters cut a remote figure in Brazil - apart from helping to load baggage on to the bus - as England’s World Cup campaign unravelled. Yet Peters is staying on as part of Hodgson’s backroom staff when called upon.

Stuart Pearce, who as England Under 21 manager failed to build a relationship with senior team boss Roy Hodgson, is having no such problems back in Nottingham. 

As well as guiding Forest to the top of the Championship, Pearce was called upon by Notts cricket chief and England selector Mike Newell to deliver a team talk before the county’s quarter-final against Derbyshire in the Royal London One-Day Cup. 

‘Psycho’ concentrated on telling the cricketers to maximise their abilities, and Notts drubbed their local rivals by 85 runs.
