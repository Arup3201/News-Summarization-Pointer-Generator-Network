A Pennsylvania woman has been found guilty of downloading child pornography in a failed attempt to frame her estranged husband.

Meri Jane Woods, of Clymer, was convicted Wednesday in Indiana County.

District Attorney Patrick Dougherty says the 43-year-old Woods downloaded 40 images to the family computer, took it to police last August and blamed Matthew Woods for the material.

But when police examined time stamps, they determined the images had been downloaded just three days earlier.

Yet the ex-husband had been kicked out of the house some two weeks before, when Meri Woods had filed a protection-from-abuse order.

Woods' attorney had argued the time stamps were unreliable.

It only took the prosecution one witness, a police forensic investigator, to get a slam-dunk conviction.

Woods will be sentenced in December on a felony charge of possession of child pornography and a misdemeanor charge of lying to police, the Indiana Gazette reported.

She could received up to seven years in prison and a $15,000 for the felony, the paper reported. The misdemeanor could land her another two years behind bars and a $5,000 fine.

Woods may be forced to register as a sex offender for up to 15 years, pending an evaluation by the state Sexual Offenders Assessment Board.
