Roy Hodgson's England squad have flown out to Tallinn as they prepare to face Estonia on Sunday in a Euro 2016 qualifier.

The squad head to Estonia hoping to maintain their 100 per cent record in qualifying Group E following the 5-0 thumping of San Marino on Thursday evening, when Jack Wilshere caught the eye with a man of the match performance.  

According to former England and Arsenal midfielder Ray Parlour, Wilshere is wasted playing for Hodgson's side at the base of the diamond.

The 22-year-old was deployed in the untested role of holding midfielder against Switzerland last month, earning mixed reviews as the Three Lions secured an impressive 2-0 win in Basle.

Wilshere returned to the role for a portion of Thursday's 5-0 victory over San Marino, picking up the man of the match award despite failing to get on the score sheet.

The Arsenal midfielder may well again be used at the base of the diamond when England continue their European Championship qualifying campaign in Estonia on Sunday, although Parlour believes he better utilised elsewhere.

'I really believe his best position is more of an advanced midfielder,' the former England international told Press Association Sport. 'His game is best when he is doing those little one-twos around the penalty box.

'He knows exactly when to give it, he holds onto it enough and he does those driving runs forwards - I think that is Jack Wilshere at his best.

'I always think you've got to be playing on a regular basis in that regular position if you're going to be playing for your country. Roy Hodgson has got to make a big decision.

'Certainly I believe Jack Wilshere's position is more advanced and Roy will have to look into the further we get into the group and obviously in two years' time in the European Championships.

'Who plays there, I don't know. It is a situation where there is a big decision as to who play there, but at the moment I'd like Jack further forwards, around that penalty box, creating chances.'

Wilshere was one five Arsenal players involved against San Marino at Wembley - a match which saw teenager Calum Chambers make his full debut.

The 19-year-old had very little to do in that match but his performances since making a £16million move to the Gunners has impressed fans and pundits alike.

'He has been absolutely superb,' Parlour, speaking on behalf of England lead sponsor Vauxhall, said.

'He has been a great signing for Arsene Wenger, another good youngster in the side.

'He gives Wenger a headache as to what is his best position. It is all about learning his trade, he is still a young lad.

'It won't harm him if he plays centre-half or right-back at the moment. You learn a different sort of way to play.

'Right now I think he'll be a better right-back. He just needs a little bit in the last third and to stop the bookings.'
