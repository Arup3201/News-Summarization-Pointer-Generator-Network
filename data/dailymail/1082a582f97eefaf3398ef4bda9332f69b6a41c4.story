Five officers who investigated the murder of a pregnant teenager are being quizzed  over concerns about how long the investigation into her disappearance took.

Jayden Parkinson, 17, was strangled to death by ex-boyfriend Ben Blakeley, 22, on December 3 last year - 24 hours after she told him she was expecting his child.

She was reported missing on December 4 by staff at a hostel where she was staying, the same day that Blakeley was quizzed over allegations that he was threatening to put indecent pictures and video of her on Facebook.

But Thames Valley Police did not bring Blakeley in for questioning until December 12, when he was arrested on suspicion of murder and a major crime investigation was launched. 

Five Thames Valley Police officers are being quizzed by the police watchdog over their investigation into the murder of teenager Jayden Parkinson by ex-boyfriend Ben Blakeley, 22, in December last year

It was not until December 19 that her body was found in a grave at the Great Western Cemetery in Didcot, Oxfordshire. 

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is looking at whether officers who interviewed Blakeley on December 4 were aware that Jayden had been reported missing.

They are also examining why Jayden was first classed as a medium risk missing person, and then later moved to high risk on December 10. 

Five officers have been served with misconduct notices to tell them that they are under investigation, and the IPCC team is in the process of interviewing them.

Details of the investigation were revealed today as Blakeley was jailed for life with a minimum of 20 years behind bars at Oxford Crown Court today.

Probe is said to be looking at whether officers who spoke to Blakeley on December 4 knew she had been reported missing on the same day. Blakeley was not brought in for questioning until December 12

IPCC associate commissioner Guido Liguori said: 'Jayden’s family continue to go through an incredibly difficult time, and I again offer my condolences to them.

'Now that the murder trial has concluded, we can provide a clearer picture of our investigation and the progress that has been made in recent months in parallel with Thames Valley Police’s criminal investigation.

'As well as examining the individual actions of officers and staff in response to Jayden being reporting missing and whether these were appropriate, our investigation has also been looking at the force’s policies and systems around missing person reports.

'There is still work to do and it is vital that we establish as full a picture as we can as to how the force responded to Jayden being reported missing, and the contact officers and staff had with her and Ben Blakeley in the months before her murder.'
