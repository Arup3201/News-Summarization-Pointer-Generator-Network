Roberto Martinez is planning for another season with Samuel Eto’o as the striker edges towards triggering the clause that will extend his stay with Everton.

Eto’o, 33, signed a 12-month contract when he joined in August, with the option of another year included in the terms. He is, however, guaranteed that extra season if he starts 15 times and is currently on five, with four appearances from the bench.

The striker, who was outstanding in last Sunday’s 3-1 win at Burnley, was considered by Liverpool and West Ham but Everton believe they were always his first choice, as he turned down Champions League football with Ajax, as well as lucrative offers from the Middle East.

Since arriving at Goodison Park, Eto’o - a three-time Champions League winner - has made a strong impression with his attitude and so Everton’s manager believes it will be a case of ‘when’ not ‘if’ he gets to 15 starts.

‘It’s just natural he will get another year,’ said Martinez. ‘The option for a second year is based on number of starts, so it will come automatically. All I want is for him to enjoy his football and convey the winning mentality he has to the rest of the team.

'I always thought his period at Everton would be a minimum of two years, because the option reflects that. ‘He could trigger the clause very soon, the way he’s playing. But the clause is not in my mind, his mind.

Samuel Eto'o worked his socks off in Everton’s win at Turf Moor. Far from his more familiar role as a target man, he played as an attacking midfielder in support of Romelu Lukaku. 

He moved across the width of the pitch, as the heat map of his main areas of activity shows (below). And he put in a shift in his own box for corners too. Not too shabby for a 33-year-old.

‘He could have chosen any league in the world. He chose Everton because he wants to be successful.’

Liverpool had lined up a medical for Eto’o, only to turn their attentions to Mario Balotelli. Martinez, though, insists Everton made their approach for Eto’o before then. ‘It doesn’t matter,’ said Martinez. ‘He’s here and I see him as a gift from the footballing gods, and I am happy for him to enjoy it.’

Everton, meanwhile, have posted the best financial results in the club’s history. The 2013-14 campaign saw turnover increase by 39 per cent to £120.5million, the first time Everton have gone through the £100m mark. It enabled them to achieve a record profit of £28.2m.
