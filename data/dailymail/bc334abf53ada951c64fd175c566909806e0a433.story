The sister of convicted rapist Ched Evans is set to appear on the next series of Big Brother.

Kylie Evans, 30, who has drawn public condemnation in the past after appearing on television to defend her sibling, was apparently selected after being fast-tracked through the early phases.

Former Manchester City striker Evans has been trying to restart his career since he was sacked by old club Sheffield United after being convicted of rape in 2012. And his sister looks set to be named on Big Brother, according to The Sun.

Ched Evans used to play for Sheffield United before he was convicted of rape and his contract was severed

It was believed that Sheffield United were planning to sign him again as a free agent, but after a public outcry the club said it had no plans to bring him to Bramall Lane.

A proposed move to Oldham Athletic also fell apart due to negative media coverage, and Evans has yet to find another club to take him.

Ms Evans allegedly plans to use the appearance to try to convince the public of her brother's innocence after he served time in jail for rape.

The former Wales international started his career at Manchester City and scored against Portsmouth

She caused outrage when she appeared on ITV's This Morning alongside Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey, to claim her brother was innocent while he was still behind bars.

According to The Sun, Ms Evans was fast tracked through the early auditioning phases after securing the services of a professional agent.

Endemol, the TV production company behind the Channel 5 reality show, could not be reached for comment on the controversy.

Evans was found guilty after he went to a hotel room in Rhyl, south Wales, after being messaged by fellow footballer Clayton McDonald saying he had 'got a bird'.

Once there Evans had sex with the girl, who says she has no memory of the incident. Evans claims the sex was consensual, but a jury ruled otherwise.

McDonald was acquitted, but Evans was jailed for five years. He was released late last year while continuing to protest his innocence.

He continues to protest his innocence, largely via a website set up and funded by the millionaire father of his girlfriend, to whom he is now engaged. 

The footballer's sister has been one of his most outspoken supporters since his conviction, and has publicly challenged high-profile figures who oppose his return to football.

After Sky Sports presenter Charlie Webster threatened to resign as a patron of Sheffield United if they took Evans back, his sister called her a 'hypocrite' because Ms Webster had previously written positively about convicted rapist Mike Tyson.
