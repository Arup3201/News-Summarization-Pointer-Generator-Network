Adam Lallana's hopes of making a flying start to his Liverpool career have suffered a huge blow with a knee injury that will rule him out for six weeks.

The England midfielder, who has been training with Liverpool for just four days after making a £23.6million switch from Southampton, will miss the first three games of the Barclays Premier League campaign — a home clash with his old club and trips to Manchester City and Tottenham.

He is also likely to miss the opening Euro 2016 qualifier away to Switzerland on September 8. Lallana was hurt during a training drill on Thursday and Liverpool’s fears were realised following the results of a scan.

Big blow: Brendan Rodgers will have to do without new signing Adam Lallana at the start of the season

Double blow: Lallana will miss games for England (vs Switzerland) and against former club Southampton

He has suffered lateral collateral ligament damage and has his knee in a brace but he does not require surgery. Had that been the case, Lallana could have been out for 12 weeks.

That is unlikely to be of any comfort to manager Brendan Rodgers or Lallana, who was expected to make his debut against Olympiacos on Sunday.

Rodgers was bullish when he spoke about Lallana earlier this week, insisting he is ‘a special player’ and would prove value for money.
