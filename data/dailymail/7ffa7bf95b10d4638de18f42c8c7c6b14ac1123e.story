The last remaining bottle of a rare whisky named after Scotland's oldest woman will go under the hammer in the U.S. today.

Just 11 bottles of Glenfiddich Janet Sheed Roberts Reserve 55 Year Old - named in honour of the granddaughter of the distillery's founder William Grant - were made available to the public, and one has already sold for an eye-watering $94,000 - or £59,335 - to a buyer in Atlanta, Georgia.

The 'delicate' and 'elegant' Scotch was selected from a cask that had been ageing since New Year's Eve 1955, to mark the late Mrs Roberts' 110th birthday last year.

Mrs Roberts, who had lived just a few miles from the distillery founded by her grandfather in Dufftown in 1886, died earlier this year at the age of 110.

'We took 15 bottles, of which four were kept by the family,' Glenfiddich malt master Brian Kinsman told npr.org.

Eleven bottles of the single malt were left - one for each decade of Mrs Roberts' life - which Glenfiddich has been selling at charity auctions.

Today the final bottle will be sold at an auction held in a private residence in Los Angeles, California, in aid of The World Resources Institute, an environmental and economic development think tank.

Mr Kinsman described the Scotch as 'absolutely beautiful', and added that it did not taste the way drinkers might expect.

'You might imagine a very old whisky would taste really woody and oaky and quite powerful,' he said.

'And it's absolutely the opposite of that. It's quite sweet. And it's just incredibly elegant.'
